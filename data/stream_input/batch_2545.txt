B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I agree with the majority of die hard readers in saying that I am utterly disappointed with this series.  Why Sylvia?  Just end the damn series already.  Too much BS going on.  Hated Eva in this one.  With all the constant I love you, then when he asks her to marry him she's all like no we're not ready BS.  The whole Brett thing has me thinking that Eva is really immature, selfish and kind of a hoe! I can't take it!  Please Ms Day listen to your loyal fans and not to the big money publishers.  They won't be the ones affected by this backlash, you will!  End the damn series, give them a HEA, maybe a kid or two and move on to something else.  This ship has sailed.  Penguin has obliterated your reputation.  Redeem it and end the book with the 4th and don't make people wait another year for it.  Disgusting! Money is the root of all evil.
B005H9B44A|4.0|good movie<br />storyline  was a cliff-notes version of the comic, but worked very well on screen.  Great choice of actors
B002NZV68U|5.0|I read the book as a child, watch the original movie, but I must say...this movie is by far the best!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I am a fan of Michael Buble and his new album does not disappoint.  I happily recommend it highly for music enjoyment.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My Grandson and I loved watching this. It was funny watching Batman and Superman nit pic at each other but in the end come together to win over evil.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've never written a review before, even after reading over 1,000 books. Never really felt like I needed to. But this book was different. I've never actually laughed out loud because of a book. I've smirked, I've snickered but never laughed. This book had me laughing. It's the first book I've read from a males point of view and I must say, I wish there were more out there like this one. Drew 's inner monologue was hilarious, it was so refreshing not hearing some whimpering, love sick female wavering back and forth. The female in this story was strong and independent. The love scenes were AMAZING. Really, really loved this book!
0394826817|5.0|I bought this for my grandson who LOVES to be read to. Richard Scarry is a great author! Definitely recommend :)
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book was everything I remembered from reading it as a kid. This shows the importance of life, and shows that you can still be a kid at any age. I am 24 years old and am re-reading this book to remind me that it's the little things in life that are important. Great read, highly recommended!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I saw this movie two weeks ago after the sequel was released.  Not one of those that will just jump in; I have to see series from the beginning.  This is very good....I'm a Trekie from the 60s, so I was dubious about it.  But I found it fun and a great ride.  Just saw the current (Into Darkness), which was fun.  But this original of the series really lays out the direction and give you history.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is breathtaking. I had to sit on my bedroom floor next to my wall outlet to keep my Kindle charged while reading this. I even read it in an entire day! This was one of the first books in a long time that I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next, it definitely is a roller coaster read. I cannot recommend this book enough, it's an absolute must-read!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Took a year to watch this movie.  I've read the entire trilogy, and of course, the movie couldn't possibly capture all the wonderful detail of the books.  But this is a decent movie that will keep you interested even if you haven't read the books.  No wonder it was such the rage last year!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed this book just as much as the first two in the series. I can't wait to see what lies ahead for Eva and Gideon.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This movie has great twists throughout and wonderful ending.  It is just a bit slow paced.  Zeta-Jones has an interesting role.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is funny stuff. too bad this was cancelled. Very original material. Would would have thought mixing cowboys with outer space.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I would have rated this a great read except that it bounced back and forth and I had difficulty remembering the character names. It was a different spin on the zombie theme though.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00821OX98|1.0|It looks like something my kids would play in the backyard. My 9 year old could write a better script
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So much going on and it ends!  Guaranteed to keep the fans wanting more. Can't wait for #4!!!  Great book!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Well after watching and reading numerous interviews from the band before release, I was definitely expecting a different sound. Upon first listen I can say yes it has a different mega-flavor this go round, but it is Megadeth all the way!! This album seriously rocks! Rocking with metal, thrash, melody, and catchy riffs, vocals, and lyrics. Oh and the album has a lot of energy too. Definitely an album to listen to when driving. After 13(which was pretty good, but not my favorite), I am glad to see Dave and co take a chance and do something a little different...and no this was not a \\"risk!\\" They should have titled this album, \\"A Whole Disc Worth of A**-Kicking Tunes!\\" Yup, that's how much I love this album. Oh yeah did I say I have been listening to Megadeth since the Rust in Peace Days! I am a huge fan and own every album. Their are albums I love, some I like, and one I dislike(risk). This one will be in my top favorite mega-albums! \\"Dance in the Rain\\" is probably one of my favorites on the disc right now...oh and once you listen to the song \\"super collider\\" three times, it will get stuck in your head. Very catchy. Why do you think the \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" album was such a hit? Catchy lyrics, vocals, and riffs. I remember friends who where not even big fans of this band who would hum the vocals to songs like \\"symphony of destruction\\" and \\"foreclose of a dream\\" It got stuck in their heads. -All mega-fans should give this album an honest listen a few times through!! Well just buy it already! If you end up loving it like me, you will be glad with your purchase. ..and if you don't like it, well their could have been worth ways to spend 10 bucks. You want to add it to your Megadeth collection anyway. If their is no room in your collection, just remove Risk and give it to someone you don't like;) Haha - problem solved!<br />Update: OK, I am on my third listen right now! Hands down, \\"Dance in the Rain\\" is my favorite track! They should have made this a radio single. Itdoesn't really sound radio friendly(at the end), but most stations these days would have played it. The ending has a riff that sounds like something off of \\"killing is my business.\\" The lyrics are about the bankers and elite families taking over the world, destroying the middle class and being under constant watch from drones, surveillance  etc. (Drones monitor each and every move you make/ It doesn't matter who you know or who you think you are)(\\"powers that be be\\" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready/ You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun/ Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come) I love that Dave covers lyrics like this. Its like End Game with the FEMA camp reference. Dave had mentioned the album End Game was inspired by Alex Jones' documentary of the same title! Haha, how funny is it that I am posting this review about this content on Amazon which has been confirmed to be attending The Bilderberg Group this year. Ok..hopefully they don't take down this post for that comment. Anyways, back to the album. I think this album has potential to be #1 on the billboard top 200. Mustain has wanted this since Metallica's black album. Countdown was #2..so close! So I beg all Megadeth fans to give it a fair listen. If you don't want to buy it(dude, its only 10 bucks), borrow it from a friend. Just give it an honest listen on at least an OK stereo system. Audio clips and crappy illegal down loads don't count(please don't do that..the music is so downgraded from crappy downloaded files. Why bother?) I want to see this album hit 4.5 stars for reviews. it will get there:)
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|Seminal read. The language reflects a bygone age, difficult to assimilate. But an epic and foreshadowing beginning to the life and times of two men, wed to the sea and dedicated to one another.  Conn Iggulden turned me on to this classic series at the back of his book Conqueror. Thanks for that. Read it you’ll like it if you don’t mind learning the vocabulary of men of the sea in by-gone days of kings, queens and those that served.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Ending was just awful, the book just stops! Still enjoy the series but these books are to highly priced for their worthy. Story should have came to a conclusion here. Worst one yet!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|this show was recommended by  our daughter in law. We cannot seem to find much of  anything that we enjoy  anymore.  My husband and I are hooked on this British &#34;soap opera&#34; types series. The acting is great and the historical times are very interesting...Was happy to find that amazon had purchased the whole series package.
1556438850|5.0|I love this book - I  wish I had time to read the whole thing cover to cover! In the meantime I am reading bits and pieces at a time. Mark Stephens is knowledgeable and writes well - I would love to attend his classes or workshops at his studio. If his writing is a good reflection of who he is as a teacher I think he must be pretty amazing.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This CD was worth every dime that was paid for it. This CD is my first for this artist. It was smooth and clean. It was received within the time frame that was promised and service was spectacular.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Bought this for our daughter -in -law who loves the Sound of Music. She is happy with and it so are we.
0679809015|5.0|My kids LOVED this book when they were learning their animals and animal sounds. My 2 kids have it pretty wore out and they still enjoy it. I bought 2 more as shower gifts! Great for boys and girls!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved Entwined with You and can't wait for the remaining novels in this series. While most of the negative reviews are about the ending and the plotline.  There were enough mini-plot climaxes that kept it moving for me despite not having one major climax in the story. There were enough things happening to make for a bombshell of subsequent books too.<br /><br />Call me crazy but I sometimes like finishing a book and love the feeling of not being able to wait for the next one because it wasn't all tied up with a bow.  Yes, Day could have wrapped it all up with a double length book but I love the fact that there is more to come!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|have played quell and quell reflect so many times; am so happy to have memento to challenge me. thank you fallen tree games. please keep up the good work! only wish I could figure out where to get direction for collecting jewels.
044024613X|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It kept me engaged until the very last page and the different twists and turns were very unexpected.
B008602KQI|4.0|I just finished reading the Hunger Games today. I love the Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson took their roles from the pages to the screen. Josh made Peeta very interesting character. As a supporting role Woody Harrelson was great. Jennifer's character grows as the movie moves. The movie has great action scenes. Even when you know who is going to die it takes you in. Must see movie.
098357670X|5.0|I don't think there is anybody that could write a more comprehensive and detailed book regarding caricature drawing.  I guess the only problem is that in trying to understand everything it is taking a little while to get through and I haven't done enough drawing yet.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the book until the ending.  I hated the ending.  This is the first I've read from this author.  I'll give her another chance to redeem herself with the next book.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Great Syfi comedy well worth the watch rest for all the family<br />Have fun and enjoy this and all the other seasons
0525478817|5.0|John Green is a genius and this book is absolutely beautiful. It is a startling and heartfelt story of two teens falling in love, in the midst of battling life threatening illnesses. Every page will have you clinging to the book for dear life as you lose the ability to can. Thank you, Mr. Green, for your literary contributions to the world.<br /><br />DFTBA
0061997811|5.0|This is an excellent book. It is an incredible collectible book that I have on display in my home. Definetely worth the money!!!!
0385486804|5.0|I have been in love with this book since reading it for my Senior English class. The story of Christopher McCandless is crazy and makes me believe he was down right insane. But at the same time, I've gained a lot of respect for what this young man did, and I believe his story should be told to, and heard by, everyone.<br /><br />A must read.
0545265355|5.0|I loved this book series. I had to buy them once I read one. I was not dissappointed. Definetely buy these..
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Was really enjoying the game but then it started freezing up a lot. I kept playing it anyways, but then I got to the boat house ( to unlock the box) and it won't let me change ANY of the numbers. I'm stuck there because I have to unlock it to go on!!!!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I am sorry but this book was a major disappointment. There were so many unanswered questions and to me the story line was feeble and rushed, there was not substance to any of the characters.  All l can say it was not worth the wait and l can only hope the next book is better and cheaper.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|A beautiful story of love and longevity!  This movie will make you cry and laugh and cheer for the old guy!
1416550518|5.0|I purchased this book for my sister-in-law because I had read it and liked it so much.  All of Morton's books are great.
B005NFW0U0|4.0|This has good story that keeps you watching, plus some really hot stars bumps up the desirability. Is a great show to end the evening with.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|I follow Star Treck since de first one with Kirk, some of the devices from that time 70's became reality nowadays!
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Mature humor mixed with immature behavior (typical of college students) makes for a fantastic film to be watched over and over.
0385344333|5.0|Same formula as the previous. Lots of action & mystery, one challenge to the next for Jack Reacher to get it done.
B004QBWU02|5.0|A heartwarming, coming-of-age story to make you both re-live the old days and give you inspiration for a new day. A classic comedy for the whole family (grandma-included) that never gets old no matter how old you are. Would share this movie with anybody!
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I already had the cd before and knew how good it was and wanted it again for my collection thanks

B00B8PMWJI|1.0|I love horror movies and this one is useful I hated it I wish I had not watched it I did not even finish watch n it it was the most gross and sick movie I have ever seen I would not watch it if I was you
B007WULJ5G|1.0|The most disturbing thing about this movie is the number of people who thought it a good or excellent film.  Don't be deceived by my one-star rating: a review requires one to check a star, and there are no minus stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun I like how they do they different types and new surf boards and people like right now there r blue keys and the pink flamingos
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a story that draws you in from the very beginning.  Each word is carefully crafted to construct spell binding paragraphs that are then eloquently fitted together to create a story that  easily transports you to another time and another world.  Thank you Hugh for sharing your talent.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|It is a good fraction calculator. It could though have more options on it but i have an other scientific calculator.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|A watered down version of a tween TV show with bad acting! Jeremy Irons must really have needed a paycheck.
0920668372|5.0|I had this book for my children .. now iam buying for my grandchildren. LOVE THIS BOOK!!  I still get choked up reading it.
0345525558|2.0|i didn't enjoy the language.  It didn't have a rhythm, and it felt too facile and simplistic.  It was a book club choice, not recommended by a friend who had read it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have viewed all three seasons of this wonderful masterpiece series.  The acting is some of the best I have seen.  Costumes and the period setting for the Downton Abbey estate are breathtaking. Truly enjoyed my time spent there throughout this series.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|My wife ordered this movie with other things I ordered. These have to be the dumbest movies ever made. What a colossal waste of time watching it. I felt like my brain was violated.Who do I see about getting my three hours back.If she orders another one I may have to ask for a divorce.The author must have swallowed the entire medicine cabinet when he wrote these books.
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This is a complete review of the Paleo diet system with great info and answers about who, what, why and then a guide to get started.<br />It's an easy read.  I downloaded via my Kindle and use it as a reference often...
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Fun app with an extensive database (I have stumped it twice so far, once with an obscure character from a 50-year-old movie - it did get a main character from that movie - and once with a personality probably too new to be in the database, this year's American Idol runner-up).  Be aware, though, that the database seems to be cloud-based and not stored on your device: I was unable to play underground in the NYC Subway where there's no Internet access.  Also, a little glitchy; a couple of times when I asked to quit the game, the graphics closed, but the music kept playing, and the only way to stop it was to re-boot my phone.  Also, there's some poor grammar and spelling (for example, \\"Marylin\\" instead of \\"Marilyn\\" Monroe), which is annoying (to me, anyway) but not a deal-breaker.  Fun little app.
1449410243|5.0|Matthew Inman has become something of an Internet phenomenon, with his website The Oatmeal. Cartoons drawn in a unique style offer up Inman's sometimes sardonic take on whatever strikes his fancy. His ability to provide perspective on cats from a sometimes unusual angle is at times both over the top and true to life.  He can come across as a truly warped, perverted person - and then he'll break your heart with an insight into this contradictory world we live in and the furballs that share it with us.  It's a short book, a bit uneven in spots, but overall funny. You may well be tempted to give a copy as a gift to people who share their lives with cats. You also may want his latest - My Dog: the Paradox. [[ASIN:1449437524 My Dog: The Paradox: A Lovable Discourse about Man's Best Friend]]<br /><br />An interesting/entertaining author/artist in the tradition of Gary Larson and beyond.
B007GE2H3G|2.0|Technically excellent otherwise ham handed, in the manner of Steven Spielberg, some fun moments but so much less then it should have been. Makes me wish I had the merit-less Hollywood connections to do a story right.
1439156816|5.0|This book gave me a deep appreciation for Stephen King and a liking for the man. I came to appreciate the art of writing, the hard work involved and learned much about the craft. His appendix in the back of recommended books is fodder for summer reads. Most helpful were his insights on how a writer is &#34;born&#34; and nurtured to become a better one. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading or who may want to enter the field of writing.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game. It reminds me of another game who's name slips my mind right this second. Lol. Anyway.... this is a very addictive game..

B005CRQ2IU|5.0|One of the best graphic novels ever. A definite read for comic enthusiasts. Well written story with interesting story line.
B00004RFFI|5.0|Great movie with plenty of drama,adventure,and excitement.Great visuals,good transfer,great story,great acting,great casting,and in color.A good look into the world of the tornado...support your favorite artists.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|There were three stories going on in this book, but two of them compared time.  One character did not have enough time and one had too much.  It makes one think about different peoples' perception of time. Was not one of his best books, but it was good.
0979019710|5.0|This book is truly life changing and I would recommend it to everyone! If you are looking for something more & a simple way to shift from where you are to where you want to be then this book is a must read. Thank you Hal for sharing with us in such a fun, easy to read format!

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|No, I have just read the 3rd in the Crossfire Trilogy and am so disappointed. Having waited months I was expecting a happy ending. Left feeling short changed, very little moving along in the storyline, similar to where book 2 left off. Not sure I will bother with 4 and 5. [[ASIN:B008UCJ7KO Entwined with You (A CROSSFIRE NOVEL)]]
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It`s a good game. Just a bit of reading. Although running out of space fast for seeds and nectar. So if we can buy storage way in the beginning that would be good.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am so disappointed in this book! I know everyone who read Bared To You and Reflected In You will know what I mean when I say book one is engaging and dynamic; book two is intensely emotional. They are really wonderful, compelling reads.<br /><br />Book three (the supposed final of the, ahem, TRILOGY!) is extremely slow through the halfway mark. Nothing much happens with either the story or the relationship. From about the halfway point through about the 88% area, both the story and the Gideon/Eva relationship begin to progress - although not in a particularly irresistible way. Then, in the last 10%, bizarrely (but understandably since we're now being sold five books in what was advertised as a TRILOGY!), all kinds of story threads are, literally, thrown at the reader. Really, a chaotic bam, bam, bam......end of book.<br /><br />You could just quit reading at about the 85-88% mark, call it a day, and be left with just a few unanswered questions, but nothing you would lose sleep wondering about since several possible answers are obvious and satisfying. Then you would have a (more or less) HEA. Unless you prefer to spend, apparently, about $50 for a five part series.<br /><br />I think I probably won't.<br /><br />REVISED AND UPDATED 11/29/13<br />Have just finished re-reading the three books during the thanksgiving holiday. The first two books are SO INCREDIBLY GOOD! I feel so let down, sad, and, yes, hurt. I want Sylvia Day to FIX THIS! Make this story what it should have been!<br />The characters of Cary and Monica have been ruined in book three! Victor is messed up; Megumi is somewhere out there; book three is all over the place.<br />Please Ms Day, give us a new book three, written like you meant to write it.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Great cast and great movie. Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren and Toni Collette are stellar and uplift the script to a higher level.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I enjoyed this whole series when it was on cable,great acting,beautiful sets,really well written. I'm watching them all again,it doesn't get old.
0803732287|5.0|I LOVE this book and I will by it again for young mommies.  I love reading it to my grandchildren......because they love the book, too.
B009MYARIK|4.0|This was the fun, light reading I've come to expect from Kinsella, however I did not think this was her best work. I can't quite put my finger on it but I enjoyed the Shopaholic books and several of her other stand-alones much more-- maybe this seemed a little to frantic or something? Still a cute story though.
B00AH6ACFA|3.0|I wanted one cool song I identified with. They made me buy the whole album. Really guys? What year is this? Not their best album. I won't be buying Master of Puppets now because they already have gotten the entire Metallica budget from me. Thanks, Metallica. Way to make yourselves irrelevant.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Plot felt contrived, the villains were trite, and overall just lacked the depth and fun of the previous books. Lackluster ending to an otherwise fantastic series.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Get Lucky is the best. Love the whole throwback theme. It makes me smile every time. Robots are the best!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Every book in this series has been fantastic and this is no exception. The only complaint I have is that we're left on a major cliffhanger, but it certainly makes wait for the next book full of anticipation!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded it for my daughter and she enjoy playing it. It increases concentration. I recommend it for children any ages. :))
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game on the Amazon market. Why would I not rate this game 5 stars this game is amazing and it doesn't lag on my device, the updates may be late but the game is truly great. The online multiplayer is also good people say it doesn't probably because there internet is not working properly or different hosts. It works on my device and these small flaws don't put a big dent on the fact that this game is awesome! I hope this helped you. Also, I forgot to mention it is worth 6.99 I'd pay 15 for it! No doubt in my mind says you shouldn't buy this.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really enjoyed the book and the character development...read the book prior to seeing the movie, the movie was vastly watered down.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|As soon as downloded it and I chose a langage it glited and make my thing german and I can't change it ):
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and the books to follow that continued the story.  Wishing for more to continue the story
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Acting was great by all actors, but seemed a bit too psychotic for my tastes but would recommend it to others who might better enjoy this type of movie
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|Basically, this was like a B or C rate movie in terms of plot, although they had a high enough budget to get bigger stars and blow up nicer vehicles...  It was definitely fun to watch with a friend so we could bust on it for its lame plot and script, but NOT one of Arnold's finer works.  This seemed like when I rock star releases a box set of greatest hits so they can pay off their ex-wife in a divorce settlement...in fact, I'm guessing that was EXACTLY what was going in here.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a fellow health care provider, I have been interested and studied NDE's since 1987. One must simply suspend disbelief.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Very well done, well timed and well acted.  Particularly effective was the younger of the two girls, who the perfect little Renfield, with casual bug eating insanity.  This is a great Director, he always brings a story to life in a way that is fairly unique and I am looking forward to seeing his next movie.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for a present. He loves these type of things. He was really excited to have it. We have both been playing with it since I got it and haven't beaten it yet. My only worry is that it would be too easy, that is not the case haha. It isn't awfully hard either. We are just taking our time on it and picking it up every now and again. Be careful with it though because it is fragile! The delivery guy dropped the box it was in and the blue tube became disconnected at one of the parts. Fortunately with some wiggling around it fell back into place. We are looking forward to beating it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Holy crap dude, I am SO STOKED about this alarm clock app. I'm telling you, every time I use it it totally reminds me of that time that I was heli-skiing in Siberia in a blizzard when I took a 50 foot drop and landed on a bear's back. Then when the bear took off running I punched him in the face, chugged a Four Loco Red Alert Monster Bull, and then back-flipped off of him and finished my run. Needless to say I sprayed on some Axe to cover the smell of stinky bear and ended up getting sexually assaulted by the whole Swedish downhill team. XTREME!!<br /><br />Ok no, really....this is a good app. LOTS of settings to customize and it never lets me down. I like the &#34;fade in&#34; feature...nice to be slowly awakened.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played and I am hard to please. love this game!!! think you know how to drive?  think again
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This would have been a 5 star review if it had been as promised- a full story with a beginning, middle, and conclusion, that wrapped up the trilogy. The writing was good- a little oversexed, but hot, and painful, and angsty. But I feel that the author it was all just set up to the next book. The wedding scene was glossed over- there could have been so much more. I didn't understand why she was so concerned about megumi calling in sick and not responding to calls. When I'm sick I don't chat up my friends. Eva is going all out- has she never had a sick coworker before? The book was just a series of scenes- no real plot or storyline.<br /><br />So much of this book I just didn't understand...there was no context and no resolution before the end of the book. I've downgraded this author from &#34;Must Buy Everything She writes&#34; to &#34;I'll Consider It If Not Too Expensive.&#34; I thought the price was silly for just a short installment.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had fun playing, first ever with this type so I needed help on some of it. Now I'll try it again. Looking forward to more of this kind. Beautiful graphics.

0552560359|5.0|My kids borrowed this from the library at the recommendation of our librarian friend, and they loved it so much we bought a copy. It's fun for kids to interact with the book and choose from many different things...Where would you go? Then they can point to all kinds of places on a picture, from the desert to an island to a city to outer space. They can choose what kind of house to live in (my kids choose the castles!), what food to eat, what clothes to wear, what jobs they want, what activities they want to do, and more...there are so many choices! Kids love to put together a fun imaginary life and this is a great book to help them to that!

B00C061I3K|5.0|Once in a generation, a recording artist comes up with a conceptual idea that captures the essence of present day underground music, fuses it with popular elements, and when it's perfectly executed, it becomes a \\"Classic.\\"<br /><br />That's what Random Access Memories (RAM) does IMO; and much like the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album borrowed psychedelic music ideas from underground bands, the Beatles were the geniuses that executed their performance to become perfectly acceptable to the mass market.<br /><br />The first few tracks sound retro dance and disco, and if you play any individual track, one might get that impression.  But, as with Sgt. Pepper, the concept approach is to listen through the whole album to understand the artist's perspective.  And deep into the RAM CD, you become in awe of their musical genius.<br /><br />Daft Punk not only celebrates electronic music from its birth to present day, but does so in the form of a pop-rock structure that is more appealing to the mass market than pure EDM; and more importantly, they perform with live studio musicians.  YES!  Great guitar performances by Nile Rodgers and Paul Jackson, Jr., big live drums (the snare is back!), string orchestra and a real choir.<br /><br />It's Sgt. Pepper meets Saturday Night Fever: the Beatles and Bee Gees' seminal albums.  It's a tribute to what made dance music great yesterday and today.  Very few artists are in a position to pull this off, but Daft Punk has earned the respect within the music industry to accomplish this goal.<br /><br />It also appears that Daft Punk had a response ready for their critics from the EDM purists on the track \\"Giorgio by Moroder.\\"  At the 4:58 mark, Moroder speaks, \\"Once you free your mind about the concept of harmony and music being correct, you can do whatever you want.\\"  Daft Punk then unleashes with fury over a fusion jazz dance groove: violins, smashing snare drums, screeching lead guitar riffs and throwing in the kitchen sink with instruments rarely played in EDM.  It's performed brilliantly.<br /><br />The CD has debuted at number one on the Billboard charts with \\"Get Lucky\\" already a dance hit and in the Top Ten singles chart.  While the CD has several great dance tunes, including, \\"Lose Yourself to Dance,\\" there are fascinating fusion ballads.  Most interesting is \\"Touch,\\" co-written by Paul Williams, with a string orchestration that builds near the end similar to \\"A Day in a Life.\\"  The song's final sound is a piano chord.  Does anyone think that was a coincidence?<br /><br />For the rest of us who wanted classic Daft Punk music, they gave us \\"Motherboard\\" and the astounding final track \\"Contact.\\"  I nearly blew out my subwoofer on that cut.  It's YES meets Pink Floyd for \\"Contact\\" and a Grammy nomination for Random Access Memories.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|It shipped sooner than I thought, brand new condition, and price was right, I started watching the show in December and wanted to see the previous seasons episodes.

B003G4W49C|5.0|My brother said this was one of his favorite books so I downloaded it to my Kindle. I like when a book delves into human nature with an amazing plot wrapped around that. It's good enough that I want to shelf my &#34;normal&#34; life activities to keep reading it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|So much better and durable than the one that comes with the unit. Cable is thicker and stronger because of it.

B005V4ZEY2|5.0|Tried the free version first liked it well enough to pay for the liscense. Well worth the money. Doesn't slow down the system any at all and worth the peace of mind if I lose my phone I have a way to try and get it back. I use this with another program just to cover my bases.

B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Fun game reminiscent of older arcade games. Could use some instructions on how to use some of the power ups, but great fun otherwise.
0307271080|3.0|I have been waiting eagerly for this book to be released. So when I finally got it I was excited! Adichie's writing is smooth, it flows well and is very descriptive. I was expecting a satisfying read and although I enjoyed most parts of the book, it did not measure up to my expectations. The book tackles race and immigration from the perspective of Ifemelu, the main character who moves from Nigeria to the U.S. Having lived in the U.S. I could identify with some of her experiences as an immigrant in a new culture. There are frequent flashbacks in the book where we get a glimpse of her life in Nigeria before the big move. These observations and descriptions of the transition from Nigeria to the U.S. were my favorite. There are many humorous moments. The author uses the prose to make a commentary on race in America. Ifemelu also writes a blog which serves the same purpose.The commentary on the politics of black hair was interesting at times. While some entries added to the story, I found some quite misplaced and even questioned if it was really necessary. In Obinze's story we get an insight into life as an illegal immigrant. He is Ifemelu's love interest from high school/university. The daily struggles to survive, the despair and risk all come alive. His story is very different from Ifemelu who has better fortune in America unlike his sojourn in the U.K. Through Ifemelu we see the world through the lens of her upper class friends. An interesting mix of characters from different backgrounds. Although some conversations were thought provoking, there were sections that I thought dragged on and on. This is a section of the book I thought could have used more editing. I also questioned the likelihood of Ifemelu having a wildly successful blog, closing it down and starting another which enjoys the same level of success. It seems too easy when in reality building a blog is hard work and few make it big. I know this is a work of fiction but still maybe something about the taskof building the blog would have added more legitimacy to the story. Others have pointed out that Obinze's story of success as a business man is equally hard to swallow, but if Nigeria is as corrupt as portrayed, for me it was believable. This book is billed as a love story among other things but for me the romance between Obinze and Ifemelu was rather dull. I found myself not caring about them and even wondered why Obinze was thought to be such a great catch.The ending is rather predictable. However, there are some interesting tidbits about life in Lagos and the colorful characters in Ifemelu's life added much flavor. One of my favorites was Ranyinudo and if for some reason the author decided to write a sequel, I would like for Ranyinudo to play a much bigger role in the story. Still, I would recommend \\"Americanah\\" because it tackles issues related to race and immigration that are often not talked about. In this respect it would be a great book club pick, there are many discussions to be had. With the right script and production a movie adaptation would be great. Overall, a good book albeit with some misses, 3.5 stars!
B005PK57IK|4.0|No issues with Streaming looking forward to Season 4 being available, I am sure I will watch when it is included with prime.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This series is so good that we are going to start over with Season 1 and watch all 3 seasons again.  Some series diminish in creativity for story lines....this just stays consistently great season after season, episode after episode.  There is not one episode where we said, 'That wasn't very good.'  Not one.  There's even places where the dialogue was so simply profound that I had to play that part over for others to hear.  This is the best series I have ever seen....ever!!!!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Always enjoy reading Lee Child Reacher books. Fast paced and each book keeps you wanting more, more, more. He can&#34;t publish them fast enough for me!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|This Team Ico pack holds one of the greatest games I've ever played.  I've played a lot of games, especially this generation of gaming consoles: Shadow of The Colossus.  And I can honestly say that this Game, from the PS2 era, is much better then a whole lot of games from this gen.  The Atmosphere of solitude, the soundtrack, story plot, boss battles, the vast open world, etc; They all make up for a very great game.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My kids love slicing and dicing fruit like little ninjas.  Granted it doesn't take a lot of skill and we don't play it that often, but my 2, 4, and 6 year old all like it for different reasons.
B00AH6ATMG|4.0|Still trying to modernize their sound. I like this album better than &#34;load&#34; but still so different from their early music
0385349947|4.0|It is so great for our young daughters to have role models like Sheryl Sandberg. It takes guts to say some of the things she said in this book. She illustrates her points with emotionally charged stories.<br /><br />I would recommend for all teenage girls and young professionals.
B00AH6ACFA|3.0|its a different sound from the bands earlier works. I guess they were trying to fit better with the times. Its no Black album
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok first off, I am a big fan of Sylvia Day. And the crossfire series is hot! Gideon and Eva are powerful characters. But I would be lying if I did not say I was very disappointed with Entwined with You. After such a long wait I was ready for the HAPPY ever after these characters deserved. Do not be me wrong, I still loved the book itself. Story was hot. Gotta give kudos to Sylvia over the sex scenes. But I,personally am ready for an ending. And this book didn't have that.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|Over 25 original songs spanning 3 decades of blues and rock-&-rolling from ZZ-Top. I was never a great fan of this band as I met them during the 80's. I am happy though to be discovering their more original incarnation of blues and rock-a-billy numbers. They are great. Disc one is specially enjoyable. Disc 2 is filled mostly with remastered version of their 80's numbers, so not so original or impressive, but still enjoyable for someone who wants to relive their hard-pop encores.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Ever read a book that you believed made you a better person?  This story moved me deeply.  The community that exists in the SEAL teams is something I think most all people long for.  Wish I could meet and personally thank all involved.
B00911UQAS|4.0|This is going to be quite a daunting task. This model kit is clearly mean for the pros, as it doesn't even include stickers (I know, stickers are bad and I should feel bad, but they woulda made nice placeholders). The plastic itself is of great quality and the parts go together fairly easily, but because of how big this thing is going to be it might take you a while. Oh and make sure you absolutely know what you are doing. and find someone who is good with paint.
B004WOH18E|4.0|Fast moving and eminently readable. Characters are refreshing and life-like. Interesting moral undertow to the novel. Can recommend to other readers
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|VHS is gone! It is time to update or lose your favorite movies like Willow. I did so at a good price and am happy with the purchase! Thank you!
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Not enough substance. I am disappointed in Archer. It seems the well known authors have fallen in to a slump and are just mass producing books. I will look for new authors. This book had no warmth and was quite contrived. The &#34;Hit<br /> by Balducci was awful. I gave up James Patterson years ago due to the ghost writers. I will not buy Archer's sequel to this book. The Publishers just want to hit the stores with a new book a month it seemss with no reguard to quality.Money and greed have surpassed talent. These authors used to be very good.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|This movie may have been the best of the three. I really enjoyed it but his girlfriend wasn't that great in the acting department (her botox may have got int he way) but she was nice to look at. ha! The special effects and scenes were really well done with the funny comedy jabs all through out it made this movie great!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Other than the beginning part of the movie, which is a little intense, I enjoyed this movie.  There was action, humor, drama, and I felt it was well done.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Wow, this was a looooong movie! I liked it but not sure I could sit through it more than 2 times. I do feel the need to watch it one more time to pick up on some things I missed but generally enjoyed the movie as a whole.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My family enjoyed watching this movie.  Adam Sandler did a great job as the voice of the Vampire.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|History of the EAGLES is a historical account of my generation and includes all of the wonderful memories from that era. The Eagles have been and still are my favorite group, my children were raised on this music. When I ordered this DVD from Amazon, I ordered 2 copies, one of which went to my son. He loved it.<br /><br />Several years ago for mother's day, my son took me to the Eagles concert at Freedom Hall in Louisville, KY. Don Henley said to the crown, &#34; I want to thank all of you kids for bringing your parents&#34;....the place went wild. There were fans my age &#34;and&#34; my son's age, it was spectacular !!!!
B009MB682W|5.0|Every  song from beginning to end .....sounds great no modification to it....love it.... every bond fan needs this for their daily tunes.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read this series all the way through just to say i did. As each book goes on the more errors i see. I was honestly more focused on trying to not go get a red pen and edit this entire book and send it back to the author and the publisher.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great app, it's a  must have for EVERYONE.  Words meanings, pronunciation (voice) is GREAT. No more looking for the book, now it's at your fingertips!!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|the story line is just too ridiculous for me. maybe others will find that exciting. i just personally was not impressed with it
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|This should have been a blog not a book. Really did not like this book at al.  Frank McCourt wrote similar life saga but it was good, this was not
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read this just to keep going with the series. I like the first book a lot more. the characters just move way too fast in their lives. The quality of the grammar and spelling is declining.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I saw this as a kid and it was my fav and still is for kids movies. I showed it to kids of this age and they also L O V E D it.<br />Timeless
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book while at work and finished it as quickly as you can while reading at work. Given the story line is a little far fetched for the average person, but i guess that's what you want in a story, something more exciting. The sex scenes were steamy even though in real life i'm not personally into this particular kink.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I've pretty much given up on television. The programming in the last few years, save for a talon-full of shows, has left me pretty well indifferent to anything that comes along.<br /><br />Invariably, someone else mentions some show that I've obliviously missed entirely and then a few more, and by the time that I'm curious enough to give it a try, I'm so far behind the eight-ball that it's pointless to even jump in.<br /><br />The magic of streaming video has allowed me to now remain oblivious and still enjoy the very rare ones that I shouldn't have been oblivious to. Homeland fits that bill quite well.<br /><br />Of course, still being conditioned to assume the worst, I tend to buy only the pilot episode as to avoid being duped by the lousy opinions of others. There have been a couple such times that I was relieved to be such a pessimist. Then there are those times that I wish that I had just simplified matters and purchased the entire season. Homeland fits that bill quite well, also.<br /><br />Yes, there are times that the show commands you to make great concessions when it comes to the &#34;believability&#34; factor. There are times when what seems like tangential plot lines are interrupting your interest in the broader story. There are times when the characters seem to be taking shortcuts to meet plot-imposed deadlines towards telling the tale.<br /><br />But all in all, as far as suspenseful drama in the twenty-first century, this is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />The episodes individually generally manage to work as stand alone stories, with twists, turns, hints, and red-herrings sprinkled throughout, while also effectively getting the viewer from the &#34;point A&#34; of the pilot to the &#34;point B&#34; of the finale. There really aren't too many drawn out periods of storytelling within the episodes themselves that serve only to connect one episode to the next. Unlike many other in the genre and forum, I never found myself actually pining for a resolution to the broader story.<br /><br />I can't say that there are any extremely noteworthy acting performances here, but it works like that. In fact, it lends some credibility to the mundane surface (who does &#34;deadpan&#34; more naturally and regularly than Mandy Patinkin?) with a simmering undercurrent.<br /><br />It isn't the perfection that some claim, but it's close enough. Conflict, contrast, intrigue, suspense, and even the occasional element of surprise - they are all there in a fairly melodic three-part harmony.<br /><br />That fact alone - that it effectively meshes these components of good storytelling in one package, episode by episode, and over the long haul of the series itself - makes it a very, very rare moment of &#34;must see tee-vee&#34; for me.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I'm disappointed and I won't be purchasing the next two books. So far I've spent $30 on the Crossfire books and I don't feel satisfied. I want my time back and my ten dollars.<br /><br />This book wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing either.  Did I expect too much after the first two books, maybe. I couldn't put down the first two books - I was in total rapture of the story and I waited for months for a conclusion. I was rewarded with a book that I thought was unoriginal and with more than one scene skipped over because it was boring. Honestly, maybe if the book hadn't spent the first three chapters on one sex scene, all of the other story arcs could have played out in this book.<br /><br />I have no problem investing my time and money in a series of books. If there is more story to tell, try giving each character having a stand alone book, working on developing the other characters stories.  Drawing out Gideon and Eva's story over five books is ridiculous.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a great story about the way people relate to each other and interact with each other on different levels.

B005MLOKXA|4.0|Ethical questions are probed within a story line that wraps around the thread of a marital relationship. Side excursions into the judicial system, corporate climate, and child rearing provide variety. It is quite enjoyable that there are no commercials!
0321356683|5.0|Very effective tips and advices. It is brief, to the point and full of useful information. A must read for every JVM developer out there.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A friend told me to read this book after we trekked in Bhutan.  McDougall did a nice job of mixing the main story line with health science. I will be thinking about finding the smile every time I work out.
0596007124|4.0|Junior developers should definitely read this. After reading the book, I feel like I don't want to work with a developer who has not acquired enough knowledge on design patterns. A senior developer lacking this knowledge should stop and think.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|And by start I mean the first hour.  Solid acting, but the narrative needed to get moving a bit more quickly.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Loved the story, the era during which is was written, and the language :)  Classic mystery novel with a touch of romance.
B0036UW09U|5.0|Even though this movie is an older on it is still an excellent movie.  Good acting.  Great music.  A variety of styles of music.  It is a musical of sorts but very much has a story.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the hunger games series. I wish there was more to read but I love how each book ends!!!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use it a lot. Just today I used it 3 times while reading Cooked, by Michael Pollan. He has a big vocab, and I had to look up &#34;synecdoche&#34;, &#34;inchoate&#34;, and &#34;protean&#34;. The audio feature can be chosen if you need to hear how the word is pronounced.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Yes, it's long, but who's keeping track of time when watching Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alex Guinness, and Jack Hawkins, play out the Arab nationalist movement being manipulated by the British government?  T.E. Lawrence is a fascinating man, and this film captures an important event in his life, that became the man's public legacy.  However, he was much more, and it was this film that caused me to look at the whole of Lawrence's life by reading A Prince of Our Disorder, John Mack's excellent biography of Lawrence.  The film captures the personal torment of Lawrence's dual loyalties, and his not being able to fully surrender himself to one, or the other.  It is fitting that when people are being asked if they knew him most had to admit they did not.  That was true even of those who thought they knew him best.  It is a magnificent film, and with the advent of HD television one can almost have a theater experience of its grandeur in the comfort of their own home.  It's well worth your time.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Th e best book! Loved how it was Drew 's point of view. Made it funny and gave wonderful insight. I think Emma Chase is really a man, cause I swear it was like being in a man's head. Loved it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Orphan Train!!! I really liked the pictures and stories at the end, which sent me on a google spree, where I learned more about those times and the real orphan trains back in the day, it was very interesting.
B00A81NFAS|3.0|and im a movie lover, yes some of the performances were good (so i get all the awards etc) but the story itself was just a little bland for me. I rented this with very high expectations after all the rave reviews it got.  Dont get me wrong, it was worth a dollar out of the redbox. i just dont see me adding this to my personal collection as it left me feeling kinda \\"hum-drum\\".  I like movies that leave me with a happy, satisfied, cheery geeling/mood. This movie didnt do that for me. Jennifer Lawrence carried this movie on her shoulder's in my opinion. Good on her for such a solid performance. The other actors (big name or not) had fairly forgettable performances and barely deserve honerable mention.  to make a comparison: This movie left me with a similiar feelings i had at the end of \\"American Beauty\\".  to each there own i suppose.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini Singh's Pay-Changeling world is one of my very favorite in PNR. It is so richly drawn and believable, so much so that at 4 am, I was wondering if I could find out the identity of the anonymous Psy from Sioux Falls who is mentioned in the book. (As a South Dakota girl, born and bred, it's exciting that an author from New Zealand even knows we exist. Just sayin')<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian answers some of the questions raised in previous books. Small spoiler - Kaleb is the Cardinal Psy child who lifted the bullet train off Annie Kildaire.<br /><br />Kaleb Krychek is Psy, a Councillor, and the last person you would expect to have an intense and physical (and emotional) connection to another person. He is cold and dark, black as obsidian. Yet, Sahara Kyriakus has known him since childhood, and only she knows another side of Kaleb.<br /><br />He is an anomaly, a rarity among the rare, a Psy with Double Cardinal abilities. This allows Kaleb extraordinary influence over the PsyNet. She is of the NightStar clan, with backsight abilities, and an unnamed ability to influence the minds of others.<br /><br />Sahara has been a captive for 7 years, and Kaleb has been searching for her every minute of that time. That kind of dedication and devotion are the hallmark of a great romance hero. We all want a man who will literally and figuratively go to the ends of the earth for us. Sahara is lucky enough to have that kind of man. Plus  he can cause an earthquake with his desire for her. Danger and desire go hand in hand.<br /><br />I love the characters, I love the series, I love the story arc and all the glimpses of previous favorites. Now, I just need the next book!

B009NY43NY|5.0|I read Charlaine Harris' last Sookie Stackhouse novel with a heavy heart.  No more waiting around for May for a new Sookie book.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Dead Ever After as it was a summary of sorts of the whole series.  Without any spoiler alerts, she tied up the loose ends of all the stories and the last page made me feel as though I had read an incredibly long story and finally came to the end.<br /><br />I will be reading her books over again just because I enjoy her style of writing so much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game. If you have a Facebook you can hook it up to your account and then all of your friends that play it will be on your scoreboard. And then you can try to be the first one... if your competitive then you should get this game and hook it up to your Facebook. It's my favorite game on my kindle. You should really get it. I rate it a 5 out of 5. You can also buy power ups. The 1 thing I have to complain about is that every time you go to the home on the game an ad will pop up and you have to x it out.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I hate it does not save your game.  Everytime you stop play, it starts all over again.  It only saves the high scores.
B009H1S56O|5.0|I loved everything... the box, the sound, the music... lana is amazing, is a great thing for the collectors<br /><br />I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|The plot was imaginative and gave a feel for how things were looked at in the 1950's (Earl Holloman as the whining, witless, alcoholic cook was considered comic relief. Also, compare Leslie Nielson's somewhat stiff and cardboard character in this movie with his more recent performance as the anything but stiff detective Frank Drebin in Police Squad). The film's use of Disney Studios for special effects was inspired. Disney's mix of technical expertise and imagination was close to the gold standard at that time (and, in my opinion, is still pretty outstanding today) and is a major factor, again in my opinion, in explaining the appeal of this film over the decades.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We have enjoyed this movie in our family and I bought copies to send to two families that live out of state.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This CD has a great collection of Stevie Wonder hits. From his earliest material up to the most recent. I really like the selections.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I get hooked on Marjong and cannot stop.  Showed my brother the fun I was having and lost my kindle for a week.  My grandson also<br />likes to play.  It is multi-generational!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is the best of the crossfire series yet!!!! Sylvia is a master at capturing the moment and making you read until its over!!!!! Can't wait until the next one!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is very nice, although I'd like many features that the PC minecraft has. Say, servers and chats and lots of other materials, etc.
B00BGICGJ8|2.0|I really had high hopes for this movie based on the previews.  It looked like a hilarious comedy about having a family and the trials and tribulations of getting older and coping.  Everything funny about this movie was shown in the previews.  This was about a highly dysfunctional family and not in a haha sort of way but in a wow you have issues sort of way.  I kept waiting for it to redeem itself but it never did.  You just end up feeling bad for these people. Wish I would have known it was so crappy and I would never have wasted the money on it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that there should be more power ups and obstacles to make it a little more challenging but I had a lot of fun.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Cant wait for the next book to come out. George R.R Martin is a magician when it comes to character creation.  You definitely can learn to love or hate any one of these characters and you do end up quite attached.  Be careful though as he has no qualms about killing them off.  This is great in that it has a certain realness about it even though there are things like dragons and white walkers in it.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I am having a lot of fun and the kindle fire has it all just start out with a little bit of the information and let the kindle fire guess
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A little slow at the beginning but it rapidly accelerated to a you-can't-put-it-down thriller.  Wonderful story, great characters.  Loved it.
1400052181|5.0|Intriguing read about the behind the scenes look about the background of HeLa cells. This book raises many ethical questions and is interesting to see how the non scientific oriented relatives felt about the HeLa cells which were taken without permission from their relative, but yet caused so many instrumental developments in medicine, cancer treatment, and scientific research. I really enjoyed this book!
B00000F14B|5.0|I'm a salesman.  I love this movie - one of the best training films ever with great sets, script, characters, actors. It's the best.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I am STRONGLY ambivalent about this book. It is either a 5 star book (I did indeed love it and could not put it down), or it is a 1 star book (I hated it, and found the story and violence despicable).<br /><br />I am very glad I read it, but I am very sorry it was written. Let me agree, as did President Snow with Miss Everdeen, I will not lie to you. (IF you can believe THAT!) The story is exceptionally well thought out. The games, blown large to involve rebels vs capitol, are revolting, nauseating. The story made me want to find a place to hide and bury myself in silk! (I think Ms. Collins intends that effect, that she is out to manipulate the reader's mind, just as President Snow is out to manipulate and terrorize Katniss' mind.)<br /><br />The story is ominously a sign of our times. Are we indeed approaching such and end, Ms. Collins? that such a story needs to be written? I would guess our own president would do well to read this cautionary tale, as we emulate our enemies in willingness to take out civilians, our own as well as theirs, to achieve tactical and psychological victories.<br /><br />This is indeed a psychological twister of a thriller, and Ms. Collins leaves no doubt as to how she intends the reader to work through this maze of a literary minefield. Mentally exhausted at the end, I personally find myself wanting to emulate Katniss, and just count (and contribute to a list) of the good things I see people do each day. There are indeed worse games one could play.
B008F5QQI2|3.0|This time I liked the single version.<br />The remixes are good but I expected something better.<br />Anyway this cd it is a &#34;must&#34; if you are George Michael fan.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|For when I need to use eBay, this app is useful... I don't use it a great deal but it is intuitive and easy to use when I do.
0345472322|4.0|Really breaks down what motivates people to be successful. You can take away many lessons on how to overcome defeat.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|I do enjoy TripAdvisor and find it fun and easy to use.  Am heading to Alaska next week and have used it to plan out my sightseeing.  Am very excited to see how the reviews pan out
B0066WJLU6|5.0|The LED on my new Samsung really brightens things up. The variable color screen light is nice but can't hold a candle next to the LED. I love this simple app.
B000P2A24W|4.0|This was a really good cd. Probably one of the better ones but not as good as New Jersey. But that's hard to do.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book helped me to articulate my thinking about my ideas I have for establishing businesses. This book is also helpful to learn how to distinguish between good and bad idea.<br />I think that the book is especially useful for persons with mindset of an engineer who begin to be interested for business perspective.<br />I like the way of writing which is very simple and clear. The way Ash explains his project of writing the same book is very useful for young entrepreneurs.
B008N1V11U|4.0|my grandson really likes this game and is intrigued with all its twists and turns.  well worth the money spent.
B001R0XNSI|5.0|cool big ass sharky pen...practiced on a dummy and it could really do some damage if you wanted to get your point across really quik...really sturdy and firm,,,,and the shark face is cool..
B00CWVBV4E|5.0|My 8 yr. Old son loves this movie. Thinks there are parts that are really funny! Totally recommend this movie to anyone who has a young son.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had heard great reviews about this book and decided to read it. It's a bit slow to start and takes some time to get going. Once it I grabs you it sucks you into the mystery of lead characters in the story. The end was surprising, but anticlimactic.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book and have everyone in my office and some off of Facebook reading it, this is a must read!!!!!
B007BT0RKG|1.0|Did not work on my Kindle. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I was very upset with this.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Banjos,questionable lyrics, a cover song and pop hooks, is this Megadeth??  Yes. And it rocks. This is not Rust In Peace nor is it Risk.  This album smashes at atomic hadronic speed all 30 years of Megadeth history.<br /><br />More than any other album Super Collider harkens back to the bands entire catalog.<br /><br />A few examples that come to mind.<br /><br /> The hard rock pop hook inspired Super Collider reminds(for better for worse) me of a much better Moto Psycho from 2001's The World Needs A Hero- much as  Forget to Remember echos 1000 Times Goodbye.<br /><br /> Built For War sounds inspired by Elysian Fields off 1994's Youthanasia-, as King Maker feels at home on 2007's United Abominations.<br /><br />Off The Edge-The intro recalls Hanger 18 of 1990's Rust In Peace..unfortunately that's where the similarities end.<br /><br />Burn!- Ok..just listen to this intro back to back to The Conjuring off the bands second album. DO it!<br /><br />The Banjos on the Blackest Crow.. A bit out of place, but not much more than the horns/trumpets on into to Into the Lungs of Hell- From 1988's So Far, So Good..So What? and Silent Scorn (2001 TWNAH)<br /><br />A Cover song? Look at the bands first 3 albums-all had a cover song.<br /><br />All in all If you are a fan of the band, and appreciate it's entire musical history- this is a love note to you. If you wanted Hanger 2018, this ain't it, and I for one am more than happy for that.<br /><br />TLDR: If you add all the previous albums up and add equal parts RISK you get this.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|The idea of this is to help others like mysef decide wether or not it is a good movie based on star ratings now all of you people who are boycotting based on the whole 3d thing have messed up a good movies ratings based on you not getting what you want, is that really fair to the rest of use who depend on the rating system to decide wether or not to buy a product? please find another vehicle to voice your frustrations. I am leaving 5 stars just to attempt to bring balance I hope others will do the same, to what seems to be an otherwise great film, undeserving of such a low star rating.<br />UPDATE:<br />In response to the responses I stand corrected on ratings on packaging as that would be correct, however to start a boycott against Disney and all the rest this simply is not the forum. We are all entitled to our opinions you voice yours, I will voice mine, others will voice theirs and at the end of the day let the stars fall where they may ( pun intended)!
B0053O89Z6|1.0|I buy things on Amazon all the time and I have never had a bad experience. GoPeachy really let me down. They sent me the wrong dvd (I ordered season 7 and received season 6). I really expected them to send me season 7 after I returned Season 6 back to them, but I did not. Yes,  I got my money back, but I was really disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love the game. animations are very life like.  The game play is simple and a good time waster.  :)  thanx that is all.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Easy to use, love the colors and icons. Saves me from having to go out and purchase an organizer and keep up with it.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Kind of boring and kind of interesting  at the same time.  I didn't enjoy all the talk about all of the recording sessions. Wanted more of the gossip I guess.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A good fast paced adventure with plot twists and turns.  Reacher attracts trouble and he doesn't back away.  You have to love Jack!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Its nice to have the original trilogy in high definition and wide screen.  We have this on VHS tape.  Blu-Ray is soooo much nicer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most realistic horse game. I love it<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who loves horses.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|I have listened and wanted to love it, but I like the earlier cds better.  They are still wonderful but evolving in a different direction.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is simply an excellent movie which neatly moves through a plot of relationship development without any negatives between the characters.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have to give it to you I love this game. And for once I don't hate it , it as fun as real racing minecraft.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Good action scenes and good acting ability from a relatively as yet unknown actor(s) If you like mystical type films I would recommend Thor to anyone who has yet to view it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A good, fast paced read.  I enjoyed it very much.  I am definitely looking forward to the next Will Robie novel.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Extremely interesting and very well written, very frustrating at times. How different things would have been if the U.S. had joined the war earlier.
B000002C25|5.0|BE HERE NOW seems to have garnered the most opposing views out of Oasis' great lexicon of music.  The end result is really that we all have Oasis to thank for keeping rock 'n roll \\"Still Alive and Well\\" as Johnny Winter sang so long ago & Neil Young's lyrics of \\"Hey, Hey, My, My\\" (Rock 'n Roll Will Never Die; which Noel happened to do a great job with at Wembley Stadium in 2000) through the extremely \\"lean\\" years of the 90's.  Give 'em credit!!  On both sides of the Atlantic the 90's could have seen the death of real rock.  This seems like a good point to interject my viewpoint regarding the \\"so-called\\" Oasis \\"Phenomenon\\".  Yes, they were a great rock band...but \\"phenomenon\\"? Let's be real! It was the 90's: We're not talking 60's or 70's. There was no competition!  But, while some others also kept the dream alive, nobody else in the 90's had the catalog & talent that Oasis did.  I don't think any other bands toured as much as Oasis seems to have done either.  Oasis might've gotten a huge break early on in their career, that they didn't have to \\"put in some hard time\\" like so many other bands, but that didn't mean these guys just sat back & only indulged in the usual rock 'n roll excesses.  They, too succumbed but they worked their behinds off, too!  So, they partied hard & maybe worked even harder.<br /><br />BE HERE NOW is the Gallagher brothers at their most super-overinflated opinions of themselves! So what?  In retrospect, they were young & shot out of a cannon with the overwhelming popularity of \\"Definitely, Maybe\\" and \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\".  As a result, it makes a sort of sense that BE HERE NOW would have such egotistical lyrics following that enormous instant success. Oasis wouldn't have gotten those ego's without the help of all their fans & the media.  So, cut 'em some slack...It still comes down to the music & Oasis' BE HERE NOW is fantastic, too!!!  (It just may take a few more 'listens' to arrive at that conclusion than the first two did.)<br /><br />As far as all the fuss about Johnny Depp's slide guitar...he's alright.  But, if you really want to know what slide is \\"all about\\", listen to Bonnie Raitt.  She is to slide guitar what Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Rory Gallagher & Johnny Marr are to guitar.<br /><br />By the 90's, the reality of just how much of a melting pot America is really came into play in music...hip hop was mainstream in the 80's; rap in the 90's, the \\"Lilith Fair\\" female singer-songwriters, r & b diva's in the 90's, the \\"boy\\" bands (of which there were both in the UK and US), grunge (I admit to liking and owning Garbage, The Offspring & Social Distortion, but I don't consider them to truly be grunge & Soc. D started in the '80's).  And, I think only true grunge fans would consider grunge to be real rock 'n roll music.  Also, by then 'metal' had started to have its' own sub-divisions! Depeche Mode kept music going but I don't know that I'd classify it as \\"rock\\". (Aside: I only got \\"into\\" Depeche Mode recently. \\"Soothe My Soul\\" off their new Delta Machine (all great!) got me hooked!)  The Smithereens (a local NJ band, who hit, but not as big as Bon Jovi) and Lenny Kravitz did their parts, too, to keep rock going.  But, my personal opinion is that none of the bands mentioned posed any real rock 'n roll competition for Oasis and for possibly even greater creativity if there had been any.<br /><br />Back to BE HERE NOW.  No...It's not another \\"MORNING GLORY\\" or \\"DEFINITELY, MAYBE\\", but it DOES have GREAT  tunes with one of the best voices in rock & roll history.  I may not like that Liam said that Americans didn't \\"get\\" Oasis.  I have to admit he may have been right (at the time).  I, myself, got into Oasis \\"bass ackwards\\" as my dear old Dad would've said.  By \\"getting into\\" Beady Eye first & then backtracking.  Of course, I was AWARE of Oasis in the 90's...I wasn't dead!; but, I agree that I don't think they got the radio airplay they should've gotten & deserved in the States; becausewe were wrapped up in so many other musical genre's at that time.  And, believe me, rockers really didn't know where to turn.  I myself did a lot of listening to The Black Crowes and The Smithereens, and got into blues...Kenny Wayne Shepard, Robert Cray, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Susan Tedeschi and Indigenous.  Also, a phase of non-\\"lilith fair\\" female singer- songwriters (Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne & Lucinda Williams and the lesser known but so talented Tift Merritt, Toni Price, Annie McCue, and Thea Gilmore).  But, then, I've never \\"gone with the pack\\" when it comes to music.  I always try to seek out new.<br /><br />In the early 2000's, I found myself backtracking to one of my favorite decades: the 80's & becoming immersed in INXS.  So, I also had to get past how Noel Gallagher insulted Michael Hutchence at the 1996 Brit Awards.  But, they're soooooo good, I had to!!  And, now I've already built an Oasis collection in just about 7 months that far surpasses my INXS one, in CD's & DVD's.  For anyone starting to become an Oasis fan....there's PLENTY to choose from to start.  There seem to be 2 \\"camps\\" of a fanbase...the early years with Bonehead and the later years with Gem & Andy.  I'm more familiar with the later years & Gem & Andy only because I've watched \\"Familiar to Millions\\" Wembley Stadium concert DVD dozens of times & listened to that CD dozens of times already, too.  (Aside to anyone starting: you MUST have at least one live CD & DVD...Oasis is DEFINITELY a band to hear live.  There's a whole \\"underground\\" of \\"off-label\\" releases, too.  It's tricky; best to, hopefully, find someone who is helpful & will kind of \\"mentor\\" you in the finer points.  I didn't set out with some 'diabolical' scheme to find a mentor; I was just very fortunate that I made purchases from very friendly & knowledgeable UK people who seemed happy to share information with me, to keep me from getting \\"burned\\").  It must've been SO fabulous to've been \\"THERE AND THEN\\" (another great DVD, which some reviewers prefer over \\"FAMILIAR TO MILLIONS\\"; again, the 2 different fanbases of early years vs. later years).  I'm lovin' ALL the years!!!<br /><br />BE HERE NOW may take several listens before you realize just how great this particular Oasis CD really is.  I knew more than half the songs on it & liked them a lot; but as I come to play it more & more, I'm loving all of the songs more & more.  I've surprised myself that one of my favorites on BE HERE NOW is \\"Don't Go Away\\"; a ballad (of all things!)  I think that's why I maybe didn't 'get' Oasis in the 90's...for me, they were a little mellow for how I liked my rock.  And, I realize, too, they sometimes use \\"string\\" instruments (like violins; woodwinds...instruments I never before associated with rock 'n roll). I had always liked big, head bangin' hard rock (AC/DC and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts had been favorites of mine for many years; so you have a reference point).  I didn't \\"go for\\" CD's, or albums, that had a little of this, a little of that.  But, the flip side of that coin is there's something for everyone! I've always had an open mind with music, though; which I'm so glad for; that I've found my way back to Oasis, even though they are no longer together. (But, I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Beady Eye's 2nd, BE & they are 3/4's of Oasis; however, I would be THRILLED if Oasis does reunite.  Gem's a decent backup vocalist, but I do miss how Liam & Noel's voices harmonized & complemented each others' so well, even if the brothers' themselves didn't!  I LOVE their version of \\"My Generation\\" better than the Who original!)<br /><br />\\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" from HEATHEN CHEMISTRY is still my favorite Oasis ballad, but now \\"Don't Go Away\\" is giving it a run for it's money, I've got to say!  I'm repeating myself, with this review, but again, all the songs ARE GREAT!; there are no \\"fillers\\". \\"Don't Go Away\\" is just SO exceptional.  I'm always surprised at how fab Liam does ballads; that he's made me alover of ballads (which I never went for!) when he does such a great job on the rockin' numbers. Other particular favs. here are definitely the opener \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\", \\"My Big Mouth\\", \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"It's Gettin' Better (Man!!) I guess back in the 90's probably the song I remember Oasis for most was \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\"  and, I'm sure, that's because, for me, that was & always will be Oasis' most ROCKING tune.  I do wish they, or, maybe, now Beady Eye, would've done at least a few more like Shakermaker, which was their most \\"blues-y\\" sounding track & they CAN do it all & DO IT WELL (a very early quote of Liam's); & SO TRUE....I would LOVE to hear more \\"blues\\" from them; but I don't think that'll happen, and that's just fine, too.<br /><br />BE HERE NOW...another winner of \\"NICE ONE\\" award!  And, a big THANK YOU for keeping rock going for those of us who've practically been weaned on it & for those who were tots & teens in the 90's, the generation who right now may be finding their way to you & the generations to come!!!!!!!!  CHEERS LIAM, NOEL, BONEHEAD, ANDY, GEM, CHRIS, The 'Shroud' (keyboards) & everyone else who ever lent \\"backing\\" vocals, guitar, percussion, etc...some reviewers prefer over \\"FAMILIAR TO MILLIONS\\"; again, the 2 different fanbases of early years vs. later years).

B000FA675C|5.0|One of my favorite book characters has to be Robert Langdon. First Dan Brown book I've read. Just wonderful like the rest of his other books.
B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|As you probably know the story already -- which isn't actually brought too far along in this melodramatic installment -- you can afford to miss it. Fantasy violence aside, also a little too kid-geared.  Martin Freeman does do a mice job in the lead for those looking for that specifically.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I read the whole series and got hooked from the start, but they got increasingly bad, and now this last book just accomplished the mission of ending the story.<br />Not worth it at all if you have not read the ones before.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very interesting. It is the series for the movie \\"Limitless\\" there are lawyers and pretty people, extravagant expenses which are all things we wish for but only get to watch. Sort of a guilty pleasure.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game. Looking forward to the next room. So hurry up!!  :-)  this was a challenge at times  thanks for the hints kept me from getting too frustrated. This one was too short make the next one longer please. Thank you
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The stories grabbed me not wanting to let go. Most of them related to one another, and I read on waiting for the culprit that never came!
0425263924|2.0|I was looking forward to reading the end of the Crossfire trilogy, and was not only dissapointed with the messy cliffhanger, but the overall plot and character development.<br />The story dragged on after a while, with new twists and uneccessary drama added to an already messy storyline. There was so much declaration of emotions between the two main characters and lots of odd behavior from Eva that made you want to shake her- I was often that annoyed. The story that was unbelievable enough to be a guilty pleasure to begin with, but turned the corner with this installment as just a joke of a story.<br />By the end, there were so many new additions and add ons to the plot that it felt ridiculous that it wasn't wrapped up at that point. I do agree with the rest of the reviewers that it seems the author dragged this one out for an updated book contract.<br />Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'll be spending the money to finish reading the series, which has proven dissapointing at this point.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I love these fans.  They are well made, well thought out, and come with plenty of fan adapters so you know it will work with your system (Splitters, Extension cords, voltage reducers, splicers).<br /><br />My only complaint is that, this fan isn't as quiet as I hoped.  But when I put the voltage reducer on (just a small wire) it is dead silent.  I have it on a small side intake bringing fresh air onto my graphic card.  This in turn keeps the graphic card a lot cooler so that it doesn't have to jet-up its own fan.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Wow... what a waste of time and talent.  This movie was FREE and I still wouldn't recommend wasting your time.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I loved this show, to bad it got cancelled.  Was a great show.  I miss it terribly.  Bring it back.
0486274268|4.0|This book has a lot of helpful hints in there for drawing animals,  principles that are equally valid in drawing people.  Concepts for organizing and comprehending shapes, and creating flow in your figures.  It's also got some great compositional tips to help you make more interesting shapes and structure with your drawings.  It's not an anatomy book.  It's more about structure and movement, which are really important things to know in drawing, cartooning and animation.  I was already a veteran professional illustrator and comic  book artist when I bought this and I learned some new things and had good reminders of others.  It's always good to keep learning new things and revisiting the basics from different points of view.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I cannot open the app. As soon as I try, it gives a toast telling me to retry when I have network connectivity. How do they think I downloaded the app?<br /><br />Devs: I use bluetooth tethering to get internet on my tablet while on the go. Don't assume that no wifi + no cellular = no internet.
B009193OCM|4.0|I bought the kindle version.  Great tips, reads well, I like that it's searchable.  The maps were  not readable, too small and the tones didn't work well on the black and white Kindle screen.  This is not the book's fault but a limitation of the Kindle itself.  Overall a good guide of New York city.  Lots of great suggestions for things to see, places to eat.  And best places to see things from.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I did not expect this to be great. It was great! I saw the play on Broadway, had seats right in the middle of the orchestra. I didn't think it was that great. The movie is that great. I was very surprised.
B00CL50KDY|4.0|The story gets a little slow, particularly when the zombie commentary isn't as often, however, whenever he's doing his commentary, it's almost always funny. A decent rental, not sure if its worth buying permanently though as replay value isn't too high.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Def a lot better then what I thought. Deaf worth renting and would almost buy it. Pretty funny and keeps your attention
0811879542|5.0|This is a fun book for children.....and adults. Should be required reading.  Looks like simple is the best way to go.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Horrible movie. Should have expected it from Juliane. Cheesy story line and dumb acting. It's like a cheap remake of Sleeping with the Enemy......
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely old recommend this book to consenting adults!  Great read, great entertainment drama actions full I emotions!  Love all the books in this series!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I love this movie. Please don't think I'm a racist person but it is funny as hell. Def worth buying and at a minimum worth watching.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is very well written, is an important topic and very empowering.  I purchased it for my daughter, This book is a manual on how to achieve life balance and be prepared for life changes.

0425263924|5.0|I love reading other peoples reviews after I've read a book. It makes me laugh at how disconnected people are with the characters, but rather are more interested in the story that is told, and not the characters that create it...typical v@gin@ readers.  I wish more people read with their minds and not their emotions and nether parts...they may be surprised how much more fulfilling a book could be when taking the time to truly understand where a character comes from rather than just lusting after one.<br /><br />As a character reader and not a story reader, it is imperative that the main characters develop in a way that is not only consistent, but that makes sense.  Rushed development leads to bad book, bad story lines and unrealistic outcomes.<br /><br />The other characters that make up the lives of Eva and Gideon should not be passed over, but rather be addressed, as their comings, goings and own hurdles and developments play a large part in the lives of those around them.  They were addressed in this book because that is how life works; we go about our lives until something happens that draws our attentions elsewhere and derail our plans.<br /><br />Sylvia Day did everything right with this book by ensuring we knew no real time passed from the end of the second book to the start of this book, and paced herself with the characters giving them not just proper attention, but the developmental respect they deserved.<br /><br />With so many hurdles they faced in the first two books, I was thrilled that it did not end in three books, as it would be rushed, unrealistic, far-fetched and forgettable. Life is all about the steps we take, the necessary choices, the revelations and the path we choose in the end given all that we face, and that is what slowly was realized in this book, allowing one of the final pieces of Eva and Gideon's future to be put in place.<br /><br />with so much left unanswered by the end of the first two books, such as the issue with the murder of Nathan, how that played into their relationship, Gideon's past that he confessed to Eva and her desire to keep digging around for the truth, Corrine still being around, Brett saying he refused to give up, Cary being hurt...so much happening in such a short time that three books to clear it up would have been shameful.<br /><br />Ms. Day makes sure she touches on the reality of development, growth, healing, acceptance and promise of all the characters who not only played a part in the first two books, but touched the lives of the two main character, while never forgetting that the lives of these two characters are not just dealing with their own troubles, but how the lives of those in their life affect their own. It was perfectly traveled....Kudos to MS.DAY!<br /><br />The book was BRILLIANTLY thought out, as it made sure to progress just like our own lives do...gone in the blink of an eye, slow moving when nothing is going right, the rug ripped out of you when things seem to be good, and the feeling of being sucker punched when you least expect it.  It was a true journey that reflected how life is....<br /><br />While we think we truly live life on our terms, it's really on life's terms that we live, adapt, accept, progress, choose and move on.  And Ms. Day allowed us into the lives of Gideon and Eva so we could see just how these two moved forward as best as they could...and did so with a purpose...their own purpose...for each other....and to be together.<br /><br />ANOTHER ONE OF MY RARE FIVE STAR REVIEWS....in complete gratitude for respecting the characters, who they are, what they are and what they need and want...thank you for giving them the attention they truly deserved and for not rushing this through!  Five books is more than right. this book developed the way real life does...slowly, haphazardly and without notice.  It was two people trying to get back into the swing of things and find the best path back to each other while trying to embrace each others pasts, demons and hurdles and overcome them together.  I like how they ventured to be more open, honest and real with each other...both proving to each other that they were in it to win it....she gave true attention and respect to all her characters...loved it.<br /><br />Thank you for standing by your work and your characters.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this book. Piper Kerman takes a very serious event and shows you the humerous side of it. While she deals with the seriousness of going to Federal Prsion, she takes us along on her journey and let's us see what it is really like on the &#34;inside&#34;.

0425263924|5.0|I don't understand why so many negativity on this book.  I actually LOVED it!!!  For those who haven't read the book, please don't listen to the negative reviews.  I normally don't read or write reviews but his book needs it.  Yes, everyone wants Gideon & Eva to have their HEA.  They deserve it.  For those who have read the book, think about it or read the book again.  This book takes us to Gideon & Eva's day to day life in a span of only two weeks after getting back together and people want to see a HEA???  Come on!!!  And everyone wants the book to be compared to reality??<br /><br />With that being said.  This book is HOT...HOT.. HOT!!!  After being separated for so long... OK, Gideon & Eva get back together.  I like how Gideon & Eva continue to evolve.  They both work really hard together and help heal each other on top of them to tackle against the world.  One of a very important sexual healing scene is on the plane.  We still see Eva grow in this book and face her demons of her past.  Eva's much stronger and fights for Gideon.  Gideon still continues to fight for Eva.  We see how they passionately love each other and grow stronger more than ever and how they continue to fight to be together.  Gideon still has a lot of healing to work on.  His dysfunctional family and parasomnia.  Parasomnia does not heal overnight especially Gideon's symptoms of attacking Eva on his sleep.  I like how Ms Day added more storyline to the supporting characters.  This makes it more of a normal life.  A lot of unanswered questions from the previous books got answered.  However there  are still lots and lots of unanswered questions and a lot to be worked on before Gideon & Eva get their HEA.  I like how this book was not rushed and very well written.  I hope we don't have to wait too long for books  4 and 5 and  I'm very much looking forward to the TV show.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|There were a couple of smudges on the disc, but the disc worked fine.  It played all the way through without skipping.  Overall, I was satisfied, except for the two tiny marks on the disc.  Overall, I was satisfied with the price of the product and the working order of the product.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read every Sookie Stackhouse novel since they first started. This one did not disappoint. Suspenseful and full of heart, this book and this series has had me in the palm of its hand since page one. I'm very sad that  I will no longer have new tales of Sookie to look forward to but I am glad that she finally got a happy ending.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Our family needed help in understanding what was happening as our daughter recovers from brain surgery.  We could see similarities in her recovery and those of stroke patients.  Jill gives a complete idea of how the brain works when healthy as well as the changes that take place as one recovers.  We really appreciated the gems of advice in the appendices.  It helps a great deal in trying to meet our daughters' needs.  The technical depth was somewhat overwhelming, but the author explains at the beginning of the book that it helps in the comprehension of other facts later in the book.  We are now more informed and confident as we care for our dear daughter.  God bless you for writing this book, Jill.
B005HED08I|5.0|Awesomeness what else can you say. Star Trek is an awesome television show. It's great they are all on Amazon.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Even the second time watching, it was amazing. The rapport between the actors is amazing. Just a great, feel-good movie. I loved it.
0425263924|4.0|I am rating the book based on the STORY line and not the fact that it's more than 3 books.<br /><br />Sucked into the book. Started in the morning. Finished by night. Can I have a Gideon of my own? A little overprotective but so what? I want him! :D<br /><br />Loved the book towards the end. I am a sucker for happy endings (sometimes!) This book however does not end. There is no cliffhanger but we have to wait for book 4 to see what happens next and I cannot wait!<br /><br />Eva and Gideon get back together. It is one big emotional roller coaster but oh so worth the ride! I loved their foreplay. I loved their intense sex scenes (especially at the bar and on the plane)*fanning*<br /><br />I still wish Eva was a more confident because she was getting on my nerves a little.<br /><br />I was happy for Eva and Gideon and annoyed that every time something good happened for them, something bad happened too. But they are strong and will overcome everything. They are working together in this book and so far it has been working towards good.<br /><br />Few NICE surprises in the book!!!<br /><br />Cary got himself in a little bit of a mess and I cannot wait to find out how that plays out.<br /><br />There are a few loose ends which I don't want to spoil so I will try to be patient and wait for the next book to see what happens with everything.<br /><br />Overall this book was good! enjoyed it!
B005LJETYI|5.0|Great, quick read, nicely written and very entertaining...just too bad Tom Cruise got a hold of the hollywood version :(((
0307278255|5.0|This is my first book by Jhumpa Lahiri and she didn't let me down. I was pleasantly surprised by the way she captures human emotions in each of her story. She has a wonderful writing style which doesn't let a moment go bored. The characters are nicely woven, makes the story flow effortless still making an impact on the readers. Its very rare to find a good collection of short stories and this is one to treasure. I've already ordered her other books. An author to keep in your watch-list.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is the best because I love the wimpy kid series. See ya later. I love the book so so so so so much. The book is so awesome the creators of Poptropica should make an island of the book. I just can't wait to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid number 8
B009NY43NY|4.0|Not the most exciting end to a series but it did wrap things up well enough.  Looking forward to seeing &#34;After Dead.&#34;
B00821OX98|4.0|My wife and I started watching this series recently are really enjoying it. It has a good mixture of action, drama and story. The special effects are also pretty good.
B00933JF74|4.0|I really liked the free version.  The premium version has problems launching on my Kindle Fire and occasionally freezes up completely.  Other than starting some scenarios with more prestige, I don't notice too many other differences.  Probably could have stayed with the free one.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|In the interim of good song writing, this is not one of my favorite Alice records, but I do agree that it's time to get over death of their previous vocalist. As a musician I know that these good fellas just want to make music and be happy doing it.  Not such a bad thing right?  That said, if no one told you that Layne wasn't singing on this recording, you probably wouldn't even notice as it does sound like classic \\"Alice\\".  Cantrell has the crew right in toe with harmonies just like you'd expect them to be...in \\"3rd's\\", but it's not a bad thing at all.  This disc is possibly even a twinge darker even then their earlier, great recordings.  Not quite as memorable as other tunes in the catalog at times...but it's well worth the trip.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I wasn't sure about this program, but it has proven to be intelligent, funny, witty and a wonderful the cast is amazing.
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National never disappoints. I've hardly been able to listen to anything else since I bought this album; there isn't a single bad track. I highly recommend this album.
0553386794|2.0|So many people have been commenting on the latest episode of Game of Thrones. I don't know what happened, who died or whatever trauma the viewers seem to have suffered; we don't have pay stations so we wait for the DVDs. The point is that it reminded me that I read the first 3 or 4 books then gave up on the series. That was years ago and George RR Martin has since become a huge success-almost a modern day Tolkien. To dislike either one is geekhood blasphemy. They do have a few things in common, such as \\"why use 2 words when 10 will do?\\" and \\"each book will end when I'm tired of writing, plot be damned.\\" But what really gets me is that GOT is not new or terribly imaginative-it is, quite obviously, based on historic events. The name of the series really should be \\"The History of England! Now with Dragons!\\" How am I the only one who sees this? It boggles my mind.

B00005RFAI|5.0|i love this CD. it reminds me of senior year of high school. i love that amazon ships it free in 2 days (Prime Member) and that you can listen to it immediately with this Amazon MP3 streaming. i purchased it for under $5. cannot beat that!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This! This is an absolutely FANTASTIC match 3 game. I didn't feel like I was doing the same thing over and over with no purpose, it kept my attention and it was fun! The other Big Fish Match 3 games are nothing compared to this one. I can't wait for the sequel!
B000E1YW0E|5.0|The DVD arrived completely sealed in about a week.  However, I always do this thing where I shake it to check if the DVD remained secure during its travels because sometimes it gets loose inside the case, bangs and slides around inside, and you end up with a scratched DVD before you even remove the cellophane.  I was glad to hear no evidence of a loose disc.  My daughter LOVES it and sings along with every song.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It wasn't a bad game, but it didn't feel like it was a 'premium' version of anything. But I got it for free when it was the app of the day, so I can't complain that way.
B00AEFXESQ|5.0|The DVD arrived completely sealed in about a week.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'm a little out of the typical age range for 'teen' movies (I just turned 30 this year) but this took me back to college and being in choir there. Good music, good laughs, and a sweet and believable romance. Highly recommended.

0345803485|3.0|Not exactely &#34;O&#34;  but it's a pretty good read. Nothing that scandalous in it either.  Predictable ending. But a fast easy read for the beach.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|There was to much going on and nothing being wrapped up. We waited that long for this book and it really wasn't that good. Yes I love the story but there was so much left and so many things put in. Nothing not one open conflict was closed in this book inky more opened. Very disappointed!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|He is a great writer I would recommed his books to anyone. This was a good story and it turned out just great.
B009MYARIK|3.0|This book does have some hilarious moments, but the bar was set too high with Twenties' Girl.  Plot is creative and unique, although the main character is annoying and whiny.  I kept reading because I enjoyed the dry wit and sarcasm of the sister, and her by-play with the other male lead, while predicable, was still entertaining.  I do appreciate Kinsella's ability to write comedic scenes in a genuine, natural way.  There were times this book made me laugh.  I did, however, see the end coming about four pages in.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Before reading this book, I knew that there were going to be 5 installments of this series.  Geeks like me that follow some of the book blogs were made aware a couple of months ago that there would be more to their story.  I was excited because seriously, who doesn't want more Gideon.  And I was unhappy about how long I had to wait between installments.  Bravo to Ms. Day for getting picked up by whichever publishing house but it was a real disappointment for her fans to have to wait this long for the next installment.  I will also have to say that if it wasn't for the book blogs that I follow, I probably would have just forgotten about it.  And I don't mind paying the price for the book if its worth it.  I will say that it really irks my nerves though that the paper back is 5 cents more on this site than its electronic counter part.  (not that other sites are any better)  That's just sad.<br />All of that being said, the book wasn't as good as the first two and the above has nothing to do with my rating.  I think I two star review is pretty freakin generous if you ask me.  Its getting two instead of one because I think Gideon's character was really well developed in the story.  I just loved seeing this side of our alpha male Gideon!  He's just delicious!  Other than the story line falls really short.  There are so many little stories going on within the bigger story.  And its not as if these extra story lines are needed in the plot.  This is just a way for the author to shadow for the next two books, in my humble opinion.  Plus the ending just sucked and not because I didn't know there would be more.  I did know.  The ending sucked because the book just stopped.  STOPPED!  Followed by a nice little note from the author...truly disappointed.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book considered the zombie invasion on a global level, and didn't just follow a few characters around as they battled for their lives.  It is rich with political criticism and ideology, and I found the fact that nations' agendas often over-ruled the actual crisis.  I did not like the lack of explanation for the occurrence of the plague.  who created it?  Who released it?  Given the narrator's position of power, he should have been able to determine this.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book contained much material that was new to me.  It was really enlightening.  The book was written well and engaged my attention the whole way.  There was almost too much to absorb; nevertheless it was never too hard to understand.  The author says we think in two ways, which he calls system 1 and system 2.  The way I might separate them is to call them reactive thinking and analytical thinking.  We are all confronted with 10,000 inputs (or more) of one kind or another every day.  We don't have time to think about all of these things; we just react based on our life experiences and knowledge.  If we really put some thought to something, that is what he calls system 2, what I call analytical thinking.  But even our analytical thinking is influenced by our reactive thinking.  It is amazing how much, even after serious thinking, our choices are shaped by our life experiences and knowledge.  I am glad I read the book!
1781162646|5.0|Ive waited awhile for another book from Stephen king . I am sure every one has actually. What I find strange is the people who finish the book in one day. Why? Do you guys think it's impressive to do this? I take my time and ENJOY stories. I'm actually waiting for the damn thing which comes tomorrow and when it does, I'm going to sit back, take my time and enjoy it. I don't know if some of u guys think you are King's biggest fans by doing this. I think anyone who has read all of his books ( trust me, if your a fan you have) could finish any of his books in one sitting, because the real fans take their time and immerse themselves in the story. They picture the story in the head who the characters look like, what the world looks like from the authors point of view etc. Truthfully? I think the people who finish this book in one day either skipped pages or just glanced over some, want to brag, or (this is what I believe) think they are smarter than the rest of us. But hey, you want to spend your money on the book and only get a few hours out of it then good for you.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|After reading all the reviews, I decided to buy locally.  I'm glad I did, because it didn't work well, and so I returned it.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Let it be known, that Cryptic Writings is my favorite release from Megadeth. So if you did not like that, you might as well stop reading my review. With that said, this is there best since that and Cryptic Writings is still my favorite, but this is oh so close. Love it.<br />I think a lot of the negative reviews are people waiting for them to break new records or something. Or into that speed metal slop crap that many new bands are putting out. Lets face it, the rock and metal scene has changed, for the worse in my opinion. There are few and far between new bands that I find worthy of listening to.<br />Megadeth has there signature moves and were a big part of forging a path that many follow. I find this a breath of fresh air from one of the bands from this era, where the rest have fell short(such as Metallica). At least Jason Newsted is making some right moves too. Not a bad song on here. Dave's vocals hit some new area's. Some experimentation going on, on here too. One of the best efforts in along time from these guys.
B00932A4XE|5.0|Loved this movie...wonderful casting; the ensamble of actors is just incredible. I really laughed out loud watching this flick.  The slow motion scene was just perfect!
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|The sketchbook pro is as good a drawing and sketching App as you can get for a tablet. There is no better as of now, and I have tried a lot. For those not used to doing finger drawing it is best to get a stylus, though the stylus doesn't change the detailing , which is controlled by the programme, it just makes you comfortable placing the start and finish points more accurately. Four stars because there is room for improvement, which I'm sure is on the way.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was well written. I liked the plot and it held my attention through the entire novel. I liked the flittering back and forth between narration and court room transcription. A must read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The scenery is amazing, the acting is outstanding and the story line has a little of everything from romance to suspense.  All of it combined is what makes me want to keep coming back for more!
0345529057|3.0|I love the Game of Thrones television show and so decided to read the books as well. I was very happy to see this box set for such a low price, however I expected a bit more. I know these cheapo box sets are not printed on great paper and probably wont survive more than 2 or 3 readings, BUT, I didn't expect to find gigantic black ink blotches in EVERY OTHER CHAPTER... some of them are small enough to read around, but some of them cover nearly half the page... I know I'm not getting the collectible hardbound books at 4 for $20, but I expect the damned things to at least be FULLY LEGIBLE...
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is a joy to watch.  Not only is it &#34;G&#34; rated by today's standards, but it is also funny, intriguing, and a glimpse of small town drama in England.  Without being simplistic, it is entertaining  for both children and adults.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Was expecting a bit more, but overall I did enjoy this book.  I am not that interested in reading either of the other books in this trilogy, however.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|It is a lot of fun to back and watch this again, great season. Time to start season two...... A+
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|well put together nothing more you can say it was fast pace just a movie you got to watch Very good movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really cool I love it I give it five stars and the best thing it's free again really cool
B004ELSDZK|5.0|Good puzzle game, nice graphics & sound, the little totemo guy is cute enough....overall it's been a good way to pass the time on the bus and keep my brain occupied.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I really enjoyed the story line I would def watch this movie again. Marvel did a great job giving back story to link all of the movies so well.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|From the title icon, this looks like any ordinary low quality flash game found on the Internet. In truth,  however, the actual gameplay is more like 20 questions than tetris. This app has an interesting approach to the use of internal data.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Great quality..it was like being in the front row of the concert!  Would recommend to any die hard fan of the Eagles..They are still great!
B00821OX98|5.0|It's entertaining with good acting, decent story line and wavering graphics early on but it gets better as it progresses.
1452101426|5.0|Beautiful book of beautiful movie. One of the concept arts more amazing from animation industry.<br />I recommend it to lovers of animation.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After I started the book, which I literally kept synching my kindle for every 2 minutes - because I was THAT excited - I started hearing rumblings that there were bad reviews.  It made me nervous, really only because I was worried there would be a crazy cliffhanger where they were estranged or something (although she didn't have that with the previous 2 books) but I kept reading anyway (too fast in my opinion, now I have to go back and reread it!  I totally have to say the bad reviews MUST BE IGNORED, and here is why:<br /><br />* I started this book KNOWING there were 2 more books, the author has said it over and over again in every interview and social media site, so the ending was not a surprise.  There was NO relationship cliffhanger, and that is really all I care about, in fact the ending was awesome.  Yes there are loose ends that need to be addressed, but they only lead into the last 2 books that she already announced anyway, and honestly, I LOVE these characters, so 2 more books is awesome.<br /><br />* I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED how this book focused on how they healed their relationship and trust issues.  Yes some people feel like there was too much fluff and/or not enough angst, but honestly, RIY gutted me, there was enough angst in that book to last a lifetime, they needed some time to heal.  I loved that this book was just all about hot sex and them working their issues out.  There was enough angst in the book to lead up to the other books, which was fine.<br /><br />* Once again, the sex was intense, and HOT. Nobody writes sex like Sylvia, and nobody has sex like G/E.<br /><br />As for those who are pissed off with the fact that there are 2 more books, this is a comment Sylvia made on her FB page....I feel it sums it up perfectly:<br /><br />Sylvia Day:  There's definitely not as much angst in Entwined, because Gideon and Eva are no longer fighting against each other, they're fighting against the world together. We're also seeing Eva addressing the last ofher outstanding issues, so that she can move on to helping Gideon deal with his. That's why three books weren't enough. I was facing a choice between shortchanging Gideon or leaving threads of Eva hanging and I didn't want to do either. Also, above any of the other Crossfire books, in this book we have some real sexual healing. They tackle some pretty important things in that area, for both of them. BUT... that's just my thoughts and everyone is certainly entitled to theirs! I don't begrudge anyone who's read the book and has an unfavorable opinion of it. We're all entitled to love or hate a book in our way. As for the next two books, Gideon has so much work to do. He's got to work out his family issues, that's huge. If he doesn't stop that hurt from festering, he'll never be whole. He has to find a way to live with Eva that doesn't put her at risk, because his atypical parasomnia isn't going to be cured overnight. He's got to learn to open up more, spend time with Eva in a group setting where he doesn't need her plastered to his side, he needs to adjust to being with a woman who's so social and loves hanging out with friends, and they need to figure out how to reconcile her desire to work independently of Cross Industries. There's so much work they have to do as a couple before they can have a solid happily ever.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing and very interesting. I can't wait for the next book! This author is truly talented and my hero! :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very action packed, fast moving read.  Fantasy novels take the readers on adventures allowing visualization that is unique for each reader.  The characters represent good and/or evil brilliantly.<br />This book seems to be targeted at young adults as well as those of us steeped in the traditional sci-fi genre...and,done so well that I am now embarking on the 2nd book in th trilogy with great anticipation!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|All of the items I have purchased have been extremely satisfying and attractive. I've gotten numerous positive comments on the clothing items.The only one negative aspect of the piece of jewerely is it gets all wrapped up easily.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read about the war in the sky over Europe and the German air force.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun game!!!!! Kinda hard to level up though, other than that it's a really fun game!!<br />Awesome!!!!!  Great!!!!!!! Expencive dinosaurs, I like the the triceratops.
1476734941|5.0|this diet is easy to follow thanks to the great information in the book<br />the best part i I do not have to give up all foods all the time
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik keeps stopping on Kindle fire hd for some reason it doesn't do it on my android phone maybe u need to make an update so this doesn't keep on happening
B009O2XY12|4.0|I thought it was okay. Not the best bubble game I've played but not the worst. It would be more fun if it was a little more challenging.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Fun read, great science tech. I couldn't put it down. Would make a great movie. Would like to read more from Mr. Weir
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mcpe 7.0 is out for ios should be out for us today or tomorrow can't wait I've been waiting t ing f2f or so long
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is cool but when is<br />Myers kindle fire going to have the update I really want the update cause my I pad has the update but not the kindle fire
B004FEL6GO|4.0|This is a gift for my nephew, he just recently got into transformers and I'm sure he will really enjoy it, he has been talking about getting one for a while now.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Like all his works very, very good.  Takes some time to get the drift of the novel.  Avery good story always.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was eagerly awaiting this book so I don't know if all the hype caused me to have such high hopes but I thought it was just okay.  I liked seeing how much Eva & Gideon have grown together and they did get their HEA (for now anyway) and I feel like no matter what else is throw at them, they will get through it together.  I really enjoyed seeing how they both finally let go and let their love/need for each other win to make them happy.<br />I didn't like the abrupt ending at all.  It wasn't a cliffhanger (as other reviews have stated), it was more like the end of a chapter and then I realized it was the end, I was thrown off.  It definitely left many open questions (obviously for book 4) but it was too abrupt of an ending for me.<br />One more thing that just bugged me - I didn't like that Gideon kept saying \\"Ummm\\" in sexual situations.  I couldn't understand that at all!!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I think this is a must read for men and women.  It talks a lot about how to make the work place environment and home environment better for everyone.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it seemed to get a little repetative toward the end and slowed down.  I think I am going to pick it for our book club read.  And my bookclub is made up all of successful women but I think there is something there for us all to learn and discuss.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have suspected wheat to be an issue for me but it wasn't until i downloaded Wheat Belly did I know for sure.  This book was my reference to a happier and healthier me.  I will definitely buy this book in paperback to keep as a reference, right now I have it downloaded on my kindle and not too savvy on how to save pages for reference.  Anybody out there who does not feel good and knows something is just not right and the doctors keep telling you that nothing is wrong, might want to pick this book up, it could save their life!!<br />dhealy9
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is great.  All the actors in it were amazing.  Have watched it twice now and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
159562015X|5.0|I'm always asked by my friends for advice about how to improve their work experience and I always start by suggesting identifying their strengths.  By understanding their strengths, they can focus on where to spend their capabilities on!  They love learning about themselves through this effort!
0316017930|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first half of this book. The book is in two parts and the second was only average. I would still recommend buying this book even if it's only to read part one. It points out a lot of truths that other books overlook. I had realized some of this before reading this book which motivated my purchase. Malcolm Gladwell has obviously put a lot more thought and research into this subject and the material is presented in an interesting way.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|This cd is amazing!!!! I could listen to the whole thing! These songs have so much meaning and soul to the words in these songs. I recommend this CD to everyone! Pink is definitely a great artist, I can relate to so many of her songs.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It is always a difficult task to wrap up multiple storylines while writing a book that might be considered a complete story. For me, my rating stems from the fact that the book itself was just okay, and not from the decisions that were made in terms of plot or Sookie's character. Anyone picking it up without being familiar with the rest of the series might not be interested in going back to start at the beginning.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Love it, that's why I bought the trilogy.  3rd time I have bought this trilogy.  This is last time for sure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the characters but very upset with the killing off of Matthew.  Can't wait for Season 4. Hope there are no more deaths.
0545265355|5.0|After my 12-year old read them, We saw the movie. Since the movie was great, I figured the book would be better. I wasn't wrong.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|It is heaver than I would have like but protect my Kindle fire just fine.  It should have clear instructions with it so the isn't a confusion on how to turn the Kindle.
030758836X|5.0|Seriously intriguing story. It was soon good that I read it in two days.  Definitely an interesting read. Resold the book online again.
B009NNG202|4.0|Very well done. Great picture with lots of unpredictable thrill on the plot. If you are not distracted this can be very enjoyable movie on a Sunday.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|There are few, if any, holocaust movies where I can make to the end.  Every time I see any variation of the historical event, I am aghast at the sheer and utter cruelty humans inflict on other humans, often without any afterthought whatsoever. This movie REALLY brings the psychological illness of a lack of conscience or empathy OR HUMANITY to light. God bless it
B001FVV2X2|5.0|JJ Abrams seems to be the great hit show maker of today. Time travel, Watchers, Parallel Worlds etc... the X-Files of today.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I now own pretty much every one of her movies.  I think I'm only missing Emma, or some version of it.  My favorite, though, is by far, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. I like it so much, I record it on the DVR when it's on tv, which makes no sense, since I OWN IT!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie was just to hard to follow, in fact most daytime soap's are easier to stay with. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B001HN694K|5.0|Johnny Depp's role choices absolutely astonish me! He has truly found his niche. With this purchase, it suddenly dawned on me, that I own more of his movies than I realized; and all along this genre.  I watched him when he was on 21 Jump Street; who knew??<br />His take on roles is great, and a real joy
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved this book. Insightful and well written account of Aspergers on relationships portrayed with sensitivity, humour and great style. Highly recommended.
B009K86D86|5.0|This movie is great. Very engaging. very interesting....One of my favorite corporate food expose documentaries.<br />Omnivore's dilemma is a fabulous book to accompany this movie.
B00BSWMITK|2.0|After hearing Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards and seeing the live in Montreal blu-ray, I thought Joe was back on top. Those two recordings are pinnacle performance of his career and highly recommended! However, Unstoppable Momentum is nothing special. There are some good rifts (of course), but the leads are very basic and uninspired. Joe didn't seem to screen the song selections as they are (I hate to say this) boring. I'm sorry to have purchased this. As a side note, the change in drummers was a downgrade. Bass lines are uninspired. While I enjoy (keyboards) Mike Kennoly, there were not the cool keyboard rifts we heard on the previous CD. Come on Joe! You can do better!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So disappointed in this book and in Sylvia Day. Entwined with you leaves you hanging at end and wondering, \\"What the heck just happened??\\" and \\"I really just wasted $10 dollars for this???\\" I have been waiting on pins and needles to read and finish this wonderfully troubled love story. Sylvia Day needs to remember the reason she began writing in the first place. Money seems to be her priority now and not her faithful readers. I may or may not finish this series, at this point I don't know if I care anymore.
0802473156|5.0|Since my husband learned so much from a class he helped in, with this book as their study guide, we decided years later to hold a study class together. We got so much out of it again. It opened up dialogue that after 47 years of marriage we didn't know we had left to discuss. The class was fun and we really grew close to those who attended. One thing we noticed though, was the first couple of sessions opened up some hurts and anger that these couples had suppressed. Each couple began applying Gary Chapman's love languages and the results were great!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Got this movie for my mom and it came fast and was in great condition. Worth the buy. The movie was ugh...girly.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|The movie was awesome. Glad I watched it. But the quality of the streaming was horrible. It took 2 days of dealing with it stopping and reloading to watch it completely. I know it was not my internet because all other movies and programs I watched were fine.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|You will have a few surprises watching Broken City.  The actors are great so it is ....A must watch movie
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|My daughter loves these games but to no avail, another Internet only game...as shes too young to be playing games while still connected reguardless of the parental controls :(.... I have deleted every Disney game ive downloaded for her and everytime she seems heart broken...if she don't play the game then she usually don't want to see the movie....Disney can do better..after all prices are at a alltime high at Disney world....disappointed dad!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app I  amazing.... it keep a me entertained all day. I would recommend this app to anyone who loves horses or wishes they had one. You can name your horse and go from there to taking care of it
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|too many notifications, not fun, like a crummy version of farm-ville. waste of time and is a app to disappoint.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is a good physics engine.  each vehicle handles differently.  I can spend a lot of time on this app
B00B2V66VS|3.0|not a good as the original, personally dont like to play this one but its fun at times and not bad, just not as great as the original. Similar to how the 64 is still way better than the Wii
B008O69SZ0|5.0|This is about the fourth or fifth great CD in a row.  Great songs, great lyrics, excellent playing, and wonderful attitude.<br /><br />Only a few rock and rollers can peak in their 60s and 70s, but Ian is showing that it is possible.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|this game was fun, help pass time while waiting in lines and you're bored of the usual games you play, its a great switch up game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app as it allows me to stay connect with all my loved ones near and far.  You always know the weather with just a few swipes.  Perfect if you want to stay in the know.
B000XR4OC0|3.0|I bought a pair of these TOMS slip-ons in red last spring.  I figured they'd be great for casual wear with shorts and other summer clothing.<br /><br />The slip-ons are quite comfortable; however, I wasn't that thrilled with the construction of the shoe itself.  There was loose stitching in areas on both shoes; but the area at the toe where the canvas is darted/gathered was uneven on just one of the shoes.  It would have been better if both shoes had been equally malformed...at least then they would have matched.  The shoes had already been worn by me several times before I noticed the toe manufacture issue.  I was trying on clothes in a store dressing room and when I stood back to get the full-length view, the first thing I noticed was that the toes of my shoes looked funny.  I now just use them for working around the garden rather than going out in public.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is excellent for those that want variety and Angry birds give it to you.  I am really pleased with the game and all it has to offer.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|It makes one sit and absorb her beautiful voice, close your eyes and think wonderful thoughts.  An absolute must have!!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I couldn't stop playing this game!! It's sooo cool!<br />I like how it makes you think what to do next !! I hope they come out with another one based on that, or same type!
B0000714BP|5.0|This is a feel good movie and I did feel good, and so did my Dad.  It has been awhile since I first saw watched it and I am eager to watch it again.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have nothing to say, just perfect companion for my htc one. I can charge my \\"one\\" three times for one charge, and to those who have a non removable battery smartphone, this anker xternal battery juice is the best partner of your phone. I didn't try the other brand as long as I'm satisfied with it. Nice xternal battery pack, and I highly recommended it!!! :-)
6305622914|5.0|I just love this movie!!!  It makes me laugh, tap my feet and smile whenever I think of it.  I took my Dad to see it when it first came out.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love Angel and Ace! I'm really ready for the last two books! We had to wait so long for this book and nothing exciting happened. I enjoyed reading about their growing relationship but I'm ready for something noteworthy to hit my kindle! Hurry up and finish this series Silvia!!!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|its awdsome and fun on my kindle fire hd but on my kindle fire when akinator guesses on KFHD i dont get a pic but on KF i do please fix
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This one is so much like the Playstation game that it is unreal.<br />A lot of thought and planning to use this game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a great apps. it works very well and easy. I recommend. I used at my kindle fire and doom 2.
B008OOYALE|4.0|It is a fun pass time game to mess around with.<br />Cute dragons too!! Nice colors used in the game.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Beautilful, dreamlike, but very sad story.As the others had said initially not easy to follow due to time shifts but after few chapters,  I was in and could not put the book down. Addictive and intoxicating,  the author is amazing.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I loved this when it came out years ago. Danny Davito and wife are great actors. (but now divorced.) The child was great also. In fact, the whole cast, including Miss Crunchable. (Sic?) I bought this recently to view with my seven-year-old grandson. Almost, but not quite, too scary for seven. (Miss Crunchable, of course.)  He thought most of it was hilarious. I recommend this heartily.
B009NY43NY|4.0|She doesn't really seem to want to put much effort in anymore, but I still read it in one sitting.  Looking forward to the short stories this fall.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Amazingly, I've talked to people who didn't like it. When I ask if it was the literary allusions they didn't like, I get a clouded look of no comprehension. Some people tell me that I should have seen it in the theater instead, for the 3D effects. Wow.<br /><br />Nope, I thought the book was great; I read it first. Now I've seen the film, and like it as well. Maybe if you like Dancing with the Stars stirred up with World Wrestlemania you wouldn't like this. I dunno. There's no sex scenes. There's no arrows and spears plunging from the screen into the front row seats. Just a darn good story, well done. And yes, philosophy too. Highly recommended.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|I found nothing warm at all about this light.  Cool and gray/blue is more apt a desc'n  than &#34;Warm White&#34; I think.  As for the light output, I would put the wattage equivalent somewhere less than 40, not 50.  I returned it because (for these reasons) I cannot use this bulb where I needed it.
0930289234|5.0|Express so much.  When looking at the true bad reviews, they compare it as if this is too replace books that are read for literature classes. That was never the case for this book and was not intended for that.<br /><br />With that in mind, think of all your greatest heroes and their flaws. Batman is probably insane, Superman can not be morally corrupted where Order takes precident over Law, Wolverine is overly brash, you get the idea. This book takes everyone who are the protagonist and makes them hard to like and vulnerable.  And yet you wind up wanting the most cynical, murderous, lunatic to be the star and he is. Thats incredible character development.<br /><br />When you can take a man who became a God and try to see how logical and rational he is, its the shot in the gutt that makes you thankful that you are not him.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I loved this movie. I would have given it 5 stars except for the language and sex scenes.  The story was great though.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I always loved this game.  The game makes you think and thinking improves your memory.<br />Try it you will enjoy the game.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Stayed true enough to the written version as to not notice the changes.  Looking forward to watching season 2..after I read the book that is!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia, you made me fall in love with Gideon more. I love the story. I wanted to laugh, cry, smile and I also wanted to kick kick Corinne's ads. Although I hated the ending I was surprised of all the things that happened in this book. Loved it.
B00C1S945G|5.0|What makes TNG better than the original to me.....the characters!  This cast is so talented and entertaining to watch, I could watch all of their seasons over and over!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I bought and read this book today (release day) and I liked it.  Eva and Gideon continue to grow and navigate their intense romance.  This book is probably 4.5 stars.  The story was interesting, the arc moved forward, the smexy bits were what you know and love about Sylvia Day's writing.  I'm holding back a bit simply because by the end, it was exhausting that the bad news/wrinkles kept coming.  Found myself thinking, what's next, locusts?!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Twists and turns every episode... Also like that when the season ended the story ended!! That's great! No waiting to see what happens. Now if season two was free to amazon prime customers.. I'd be in the middle of it now
1401309666|5.0|A well-written account of why the retail sector was so disrupted by the market breadth of the internet.  Altho the original publishing date was a long time go, in current market trends, the work does a great job of explaining the reasons and effects of &#34;long tail&#34; development upon many aspects of live, applicable well beyond retail enterprises.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I like this show a lot..a little far fetched but I'm not a reality tv person so it works for me
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Simple and straightforward to use. I enjoy being able to quickly look up a word. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't allow  you to browse through the pages of  words of a specific letter (or if it does I haven't figured out how to do it).  I chose this one to replace the dictionary that came preloaded on my Kindle Fire, as was not searchable  (had to flip through the pages or jump to a page or location - not useful as a dictionary).  I haven't tried any of the purchased (as in &#34;not free&#34;) dictionaries so I can't compare this one to those products.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator app. The buttons are nice and big and so much better than the calculator on my phone (too small). Really glad I found this and I have gotten much use out of it.
B00138KKMQ|5.0|This Album is for you. Even the songs I didn't have high on my list of 'wants' are gonna get playing time. The &#34;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&#34; was one I hadn't heard for a while, but listening to it as I wander down some country roads reminds me of the good old days. Great Album and easy to sing along with- enjoy it.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|I wanted some music that was really motivating while exercising.  With this CD I found what I was looking for!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I saw the movie and had to read the book so bought them all.  I was surprised that the book was so good that the movie followed the story line some what.  But, the book was so much better. I was glad for the difference because I did not want to put the book down.  Ready to start the next book hope you can fine time to do the fourth book.<br />Thank you for your books!
B001XUPGLY|4.0|This movie is great, as all Star Trek movies are, but the amazon player was glitchy on our Xbox and we have cable so it wasn't our connection.  The movie would lag, and sometime the audio didn't match the video and would get out of sync.
B001E25MBK|5.0|great price
B00ALKRVTM|5.0|You just have to face it - either you a Poirot fan or you are not. These delightful stories show the Poirot detection in a smaller format as usual, as a restful contrast to the longer novels. Well worth reading!
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was, in my opinion, one of the best of the year. I've seen it four times and it never gets old.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|All that a Trek fan would want in a Blu-ray release!  This is jammed packed with Trek extras and bonus features.  The quality is Top Notch!  Everyone who loves Trek should have this in their collection!  It's my favorite Blu-ray to date!
B004JVXTL8|3.0|Definitely creepy, but no real conclusion. It's not something I would watch again, but it definitely gave me the creeps after I watched it initially.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great read from a males version that is completely how a man thinks and is hilarious! Loved this book will read it again very soon!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I love the Vampire Academy series. In fact, it just might be my favorite series of all time. The characters are so dynamic and interesting.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It absolutely inspired me and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|This was great movie rented for my son he love's fast and the furious. We even saw the new one that came out that was great too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am a database administrator. I read a lot but mostly technical books. It's been a while since I read a fiction book and I think I picked this book after I saw a preview for the upcoming movie. I doubt the movie will be able to do the book justice but this book was awesome. I think everyone can identify with Ender on some level. Weeks after I have finished this book I still find myself thinking about it. If you are wondering if you should get the book or not, just buy it. You won't regret it.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|I have looked through several of these reviews of Sector 1 and have realized that there is no point for me to go into how fantastic it sounds and discuss the insanely improved quality. So, I will talk about how any individual with a pulse, that enjoys any form of music, needs to own this.  It does not matter that I am a huge Rush fan, and believe that if you do not love Rush you are a lower class of human.  I am certain that you will enjoy this.  Great band, great collection of music, get all three sectors, and while you are at it, get the complete works of Queen as well....
0061124958|5.0|What a classic story. We bought this book to donate to a school in honor of an employee who is retiring!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Don't judge a book by it cover or don't judge a tv series by not watching it. I was thinking that this might be something I don't want to watch and I was wrong.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This guy is totally amazing and I couldn't wait for his first album!  I hope this is only the first of many for him!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am always at the edge o  my seat waiting for the next part, hoping things work out for everyone.  Love the Crossfire novels thank you for continuing this series and looking forward  to th  Ned  book.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|I just needed a microphone to record my drunken diatribes.  I like the feel of holding this guy.  Works well with my m-audio and garageband.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have had my headset for a bit over half a year, and I love it a lot.  That being said, it does have its drawbacks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Wireless<br />-Range is extremely long<br />-Decently Good Battery Life<br />-Good Sound Quality for most things<br />-The Microphone is Solid<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Some sounds come out pretty badly, near painful<br />-Power button is pretty messed up<br />-Microphone does not always mute itself, but this may just be mine<br /><br />The main reason I got this headset was because it was wireless.  Wireless was necessary for me, as I have a cat that loves to chew on cords.  The battery life of the headset is very strong, and if it does run out you can continue using it while it is charging.  The range is also very strong.  I can walk down a long flight of stairs and still recieve good connection to the computer.  Range is definitely good enough for any distance that would realistically be reached.<br /><br />When I got the headset I was skeptical about this whole \\"Surround Sound\\" thing.  I have never been impressed by the surround sound system in headphones before, but these I thoroughly enjoyed.  The ability to turn it on and off was also very nice, as when gaming I like to turn it off for FPS games.<br /><br />I would not consider myself much of an audiophile, but I can definitely tell the difference between good headsets and great headsets.  Honestly, I would not categorize these as great.  The sound quality is good, but not outstanding.  There are many sounds that come out as painful.  The best example of this is in the game Counter Strike.  When a bomb goes off it creates a loud deepish *boom* sound, but the headsets just give out a painful sounding static.  I don't think this has always happend with the headsets, so it may be a faulty pair that I have, but I actually doubt it.  The sound quality is decent, but I wouldn't get these if you are going for top-notch sound.<br /><br />The microphone is also great on these headphones.  Over Skype and in games my friends can all hear my well.  I have never recieved a complaint about the sound quality of my microphone.  Also with the \\"Configure G930\\" panel you can set different mods on your voice.  I have only used this once, but its still a fun thing to have access to.<br /><br />Another thing that I have noticed is that the power button on the headset is pretty messed up.  I have a lot of trouble turning them on and off.  Half the time I push the button it doesn't register, and it has to be held for a long time before the headset actually powers off.  The button has also receded into the headset, making it hard to press.<br /><br />Finally, a feature involving the mic is not working on my headset.  When you move the microphone to an upwards position it should auto-mute, but for me it does not do it half the time.  Again, this could just be with my product, but it may happen for others.  It is a minimal problem, as the headset has a mute button on the left ear anyway, but still worth noting.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this headset is good, but not great.  I would give it 3.5/5 stars.  If you are deadset on a wireless headset, and this is in your price range then it is a good buy.  If you don't really need wireless then I would recommend going for some higher-quality wired headphones that can be found for the same price.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Love the story. Great for both kids and grow ups. My girls watched for the first time and were glued to the tv.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Loved this CD - Lady A always does a great job.  If you like Lady A, you'll love this CD.
B002ZG999U|5.0|If you enjoy an action packed shoot em up movie you will love this flick. Action all the way through till the end.
B008220BLG|1.0|This movie is very slowly paced and could not finish watching as it was so slow moving.  Few gross scenes but were not gory like most horror movies today.  Yes there is blood but the eating scenes were done off camera.  I didnt get half way into the movie and shut it off, which it very rare for me to do as I do want to see how most movies end.  Surprised how many enjoyed this movie.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I've been buying each of Jeffrey Archer's (The Clifton Chronicles) books as they come out - he writes with such clarity - you are totally engrossed in the events as they unfold.  This latest of the series didn't disappoint.  Can't wait for his next one.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The love and passion in this book is still spot on. The first half of the book did read slow for me however the last half was full of twist and turns and couldn't have been written better. I am looking forward to seeing where this story is heading. I would think true fans of this story would be excited that we get two more books.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|As with most app's it is a great shortcut to Google. I use it often and I would definately recommend.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I purchased this for my Kindle after reading the description which drew my interest.  Many have gone into a lot of specifics on the story line, setting and historical interests.  I will just be very generic: I initially had trouble \\"getting into\\" the story.  I felt there was a lot of switching back and forth to set the scenes for later chapters.  I almost stopped reading the book, but decided to continue on.... shortly after everything was coming together and I couldn't wait to continue on.  This was a great read!  I recommend to all who like a great thriller.  I have just purchased the second in the series - the Secret Speech - and can't wait to get started.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Hey..it's a nice app to have. It just doesn't replace a regular HD camera. Get this app, but don't expect high quality pics.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Game that doesnt lose its appeal over time. Your standard time investment game at your leisure. But there are some inconveniences with the touching.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Get this app for your Kindle. It is needed at times to run certain videos. Just get it, keep it handy.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The story lines are good. Office infighting and involved character relationships and surprise endings all make this a enjoyable series to watch
B006TTC54A|5.0|This is a one of a kind movie.  I have always enjoyed their music. It was a great view and always will be.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|This book took me on an emotional journey.If you are looking for the type a book to stir your emotions. make you smile ,laugh .cry, appreciate etc then this book is for you.I really enjoyed this book!!
B004I654WQ|5.0|the kids absolutely loved this movie. it was exactly what we ordered, and having the dvd copy will help for taking it in the car
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Completely disappointed in this book. Thought it'd wrap up the story really nicely, instead I find forced story lines and a disappointing read. May not want to continue. This book sort of ruined it for me.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Great touch game. I prefer Veggie Samurai, but this is the original and it is great.  I wish bombs weren't insta kills.
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|Music. Rock Music. With touches of Blues and Heavy Metal. Classic Fresh. Organic. Awesome... Buy it... Only knock is i would've like a barnstormer kind of song ala Hey Cisco from Perpindicular; something up-tempo. Still great. BUY IT... Hard to believe four of these guys are in their 60's. F@#$%&* KILLER! BUY IT!!!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Girlfriend hates horror movies, but this one we could actually watch together.  Mainly it is a rom/com with some horror aspects.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Better than Glee. The characters are people you care about and want to know more.  Sorry the show was not renewed.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Firefly  had it been named serenity like the movie might have caught the attention of more people such as myself. I being a joss wheadon fan in general missed out on thia show when it originally aired. But never the less this show kicks ass.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I loved this book as a child. Love it even more now, although I see the garden through older eyes! Recommend to anyone who hasn't read...recommend re-reading it to anyone who hasn't read this book lately.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Great read!!!!  Totally Grisham And absolutely a GREAT read!! If you're not a Grisham fan, yet, this book will hook you! As you can tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Enjoy...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book a lot hope others get it too a great read for kids and young adults go greg
B00B2166BS|4.0|I wrote one review about this that wasn't too good. However, after using it for awhile I would like to revise it. It charges just fine, in fact it's all i use now to charge it. I do wish that there was something else it did besides charge. If you are looking for a charger for your Nexus 10 i would now recommend this cable.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG!!  This is a great book!  I could not put it down.  I will reread it over again while I'm waiting......;)
B00B8M4IMK|2.0|When I bought this charger, I thought it was going to deliver the full 3.6A through each charging port. It doesn't. One port gives you 1.5A, the other gives you 2.1A. Not what i was expecting. It does do the job, but to find out the amps, you have to read the very last paragraph under popular compatible chargers. The discription is misleading.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like this book, however I knew this wouldn't be the end of series a for at least at week. I get that people are upset that what was originally called a trilogy is now a series and its pissing em off. I love the characters and think that a series is great (TV series I'm not so sure about). Anyway I like this novel and feel like it left a lot of unanswered questions...which isn't a bad thing as long at it doesn't take forever for books for 4 and 5!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very challenging and fun. There are several games within the game, and now I am eagerly awaiting the next one!
1451695195|5.0|This is an awesome book to read and digest.  I saw the author on Oprah, he has written a great book but the interview was not as exciting as the book.<br /><br />An avid reader,<br />Rafeya
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Not the best I've played from G5, but it was fun and time consuming and served its purpose. Plus you cant beat the sale price.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|very, very nice Very easy to use and so far has let me down. i like the diofferent sounds you can use to wake up
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm obsessed with the hidden object mystery games from G5, Big Fish, and others. I've played several and this is my favorite so far. I love the setting, the objects, the characters, and the plot. I will play it again.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|it is very easy to use. I use it when I widhy to send photos from my kindle to freinds and family
1439152802|5.0|The characters are intriguing, and the story line even more so.  All along, I knew there was a secret.  But I thought I knew what it was.  I recall saying out loud at one point, &#34;What?!!!&#34;  It's a great story that will stay with you.  I was sorry it ended.
B008J34466|5.0|I especially like all the popular songs and thought it well worth the purchase.  If you are a Pink fan, you will like it also.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|After listening to Young and Beautiful on the radio, I had to buy the whole album. Great music! Great work of art! I listen to this when writing. It helped me over a road block in one of my books! Author R. Holland
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Such an amazing story about love and rising from the ashes. Can't wait to read it again. Highly recommended for lovers of romance and the human spirit.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it......A+++++  Can.t wait for the next room to come out.  What a good way to pass time and keep your mind working
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch perfect has you laughing the whole way through. If you are a fan of glee this would be a perfect movie for you. Lots of singing and plenty of comedy. If you haven't seen it check it out today!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The kids like this but lose interest in it fast. They don't really give a reason but notice that they switch to other games within a few minutes.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The publishers were super deceptive while promoting these books by letting us believe this was a trilogy. I paid 10 dollars with the belief I was paying for the final book. Terrible.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Rather disconnected story trying to make everything that ever happened to Sookie  fit into the final book of this series.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Graphics and quality was horrid, I would say stick to the first temple run. It is way better than this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I rolled through all 3 books in as many days. Katniss is a believable character and a great female protagonist. I was delighted by the impact she had on her world as she helps rebuild it.  Highly recommended.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Didn't think the series could get any better - it did!  I absolutely love the detailed historical, scenery and character descriptions.  Ms. Gabaldon is a storyteller &#34;extradinaire&#34;!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A Great dystopia novel with an interesting female protagonist. I had to finish the series immediately. A very satisfying read!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great game awesome graphics Great skins son love it I love it need more villains super kill venom costume my favorite
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I rolled through all 3 books in as many days. Katniss is a believable character and a great female protagonist. I could have used a wee bit less romance triangle business, but the overarching story is great. Highly recommended.
B003F1WM2K|3.0|Patti Smith can be incredibly eloquent when she actually decides to give us a window into herself. Unfortunately, for most of this memoir, she doesn't choose to do that. Her book suffers from discontinuity - all of a sudden she is married and has left New York - what has precipitated this? She gives us frustrating hints about conflicts in her life, then paints them over with a rose-colored brush. Men asking her for money? VD from someone who cheats on her? Oh well. Married man who leaves her? What the heck. Mapplethorpe is no longer attracted to women but still wants to sleep with her? She feels flattered that he still finds her attractive. Her new husband? \\"A king among men.\\" Why? Where are the real feelings? Not here.<br /><br />The strongest part of the memoir is the beginning, when she talks about the kind of person she was as a child, and about the magic she felt upon meeting Mapplethorpe. Soon, her story dissolves into endless details about what she is wearing and who was at Max's as well as a surfeit of random French references that come off as insufferably pretentious. She didn't like a film because it \\"wasn't French enough.\\"<br /><br />If you want to get a real window into Smith, just listen to her beautiful Memorial Song for Mapplethorpe. That will tell you more about her than this book.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|You know that 'Game of Thrones' episode that just came on. The Red Wedding? Well that's what you would want to do to people after listening to this album. Stab people and slit their throats. This album make's St. Anger (which came out 10 years ago today) look like '...And Justice for All'. If you download the album illegally, You will still ask for your money back. I'm getting angry just writing this review, but yeah, just don't buy it.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|Probably not much better than any other simple notepad for Fire.  Better than some.  It's not that big a deal.  If you need a notepad, and most of us do, this is okay. It is simply a matter of preference.
B0034G4P94|1.0|This movie is horrible.  I don't feel as though it's worth my time to write out all of the problems about this movie.  I'm a fan of Tom Hardy's work, but he should have passed on taking this part.  Can't believe this was critically acclaimed and that there are so many positive reviews about it.  If you want a good fighting movie watch Raging Bull or something.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|East to install and use.  With the sister program for your PC you can bring up your PC desktop on your Kindle Fire.  Why would you do that?  It was my first question also.  Now that I have it became a good idea for many reasons.  Try and find your own reasons.  It works and both programs were free.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|This movie had a good cast and a good story, but it was told in a way that didn't manage to get the viewer to care.  I'm not sure why, but I asked the two other people who viewed it with me and their response was similar.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a great story.  Well-paced, believable. Not sure how this guy knew so many technical details about space exploration, and he's Scottish.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Terrific book and I'm so glad I gave it a chance . You will laugh, cry and contemplate right along with her !
B004KPX4W2|4.0|If you like action films, this one is for you. Bruce Willis has his usual charm and wit. Leaves bad language out.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|I haven't seen the original, but I would probably like it a lot better since there wouldn't be so many oddities between the 80's soundtrack and the 2011 remake.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I had Kindle for PC and my drive crashed, figured I could use the Android version to access my content. Tried using the system version (on ne Samsung Note 2) but it would not complete the registration process. No help from either Kindle or Verizon tech support. So I had the idea of downloading from Amazon, which I did and it overwrote the system copy. Thought I had the solution, but still will not complete the registration.<br />I have Android 4.1.2 - anyone else had this problem??<br /><br />6/7/13 UPDATE: After 6 weeks and innunumerable calls the problem seems corrected. Finally got escalated to Tier 2 support...encourage anyone else with issues to start asking for this early in the process. Rating stays same until fix is stable.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Even though the cover suggests this book is the written version of the movie, it was great to have the differences.<br />Matthew Quick does a wonderful job of articulating what it is like inside the mind of someone with mental illness.<br />The book is much more realistic to life where as the movie is more hollywoodized and ends all neat and tidy.<br />The book leaves you wanting more (which is great) and you don't know how things will turn out, but hope they work out for Pat's sake.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm not a mystery reader but enjoy a well constructed book.  I enjoyed the first half of the this book but the second half was not as engrossing, as if the author got tired of the characters and just wanted to end the book.  There's potential that went unfulfilled.
B001FB5634|4.0|This was a nice film which was adapted from the book. I have never read the book, but the film really kept my attention as the pair of father and son moved through the destroyed earth journey seeking all the basic life essentials. You never knew what was coming next and the director successfully avoided making it a dark film, which happens all too often with this type of film.<br /><br />  The story really captures you at times and you feel the anxiety of the characters. I recommend this film to anybody who enjoys science fiction and apocalyptic films. The ending is better than I thought and really challenges the characters.
0385536828|3.0|Ian McEwan is an excellent writer.  His style is easy to loose yourself in.  Good characters build ups.  Nice attention to details.  All adds to a good novel.
B0082EOJYE|5.0|This was a really awesome film, it is filmed so well and creatively written to the point that the sound isn't necessary to understanding exactly what is going on. It definitely deserved best picture and is worth the watch.
0812983459|2.0|Harold seems like such a sweet man.  The premise is interesting, reminds me a little of Forrest Gump.  But I did not find the book engaging or the writing great.  I'm disappointed at the great reviews and awards.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|I got this app thinking it would be really cool and allow for nice output photos that I could hang on my wall. The effects are ok, but overall not worth your time. There are much better photo editing apps out there.<br /><br />Recommended only for someone trying to mess around with all types of photo editing apps.
B007D1HVW4|5.0|Antonio Banderas is a riot as Puss in Boots.  The animation is superb & I especially loved watching the dancing scenes.  Watched this movie several times over with my Grandson who really loves it too.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|The guest artists are so varied that you wonder how they will work together.  The brief glimpse of the personalities of these artists give you a better appreciation of them as people as well as performers.  Bennett shows remarkable ability and range for his age.
0316113514|5.0|The book can get a little sciency at times, but when I finished, I wanted to give a copy to everyone that I love.<br /><br />I wrote this post about SPARK to celebrate National Running Day.<br /><br />http://www.insideworkplacewellness.com/2013/06/train-your-brain.html
B009RH9J7W|4.0|This cover was the perfect protection piece for the kindle. Easy to clean, stylish and handsome. The only drawback is the location of the charging port. This puts the camera on the bottom. Have not used the camera, so I can't really say if this is a problem.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I do not like any games that you have to have the internet turned on for the kids to play it and this is one of those games.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Started watching when I noticed Walton Goggins was in it, had been watching Justified and enjoyed his charachter's depth. Through S3 so far, definitely entertaining and has a few arcs.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Just finished reading this book.  OMG.  I can't believe I have been waiting months, through all these release day changes and she gives us this crap!  Really considering asking for a refund.  Save your money and just read the second book again and again.  Because guess what??  You have to wait for the FOURTH book to get any new information.  She won't be getting my $$$.  Because I'm sure there will be a fifth book and then a sixth book.  She obviously is in this only for the $$.  No resolution on ANY issues what so ever.  Poor MR Cross deserved better and so do your fans.  Unbelievable!!!!!!!
B008469DGY|4.0|Great game. Very addictive and fun to play. Very challenging, I agree with others that it would be great to play an actual course or courses. I would highly recommend this game. Thanks for something so fun.
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|There are a few songs on it I like but for the most part I could do with out this one
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I don't understand the bad reviews. We are talking about Gideon cross and you can never have enough of him. I really enjoyed this book and loved learning more about Gideon' s backstory. I really enjoyed this romance and the sex in this book. It flowed smoothly for me and I love Eva and Gideon. Can not wait for another book. Keeps up the good work sylvia day.......
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a fun game if you are a fan of Galaga. The controls are easy to use. With three different modes it is very entertaining and a little addictive.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Even better than the first season!  I laughed twice as hard and they definitely outdid themselves.  Looking forward to Season 3.
B004ELSDZK|3.0|Its great for the kids not really for an adult.  Very simplistic.  Even as it progresses it becomes boring , then like everything else you discard it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is wonderful. Now I can stay in touch with my friends. You don`t even need a phone to text because you can do it right on your Kindle or iPod with this wonderful app.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Great app!  When it doesn't crash.  Mind boggling how it can guess my random choices!  Fix the crashes and it gets five stars...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun because you go through all these obstacles and the game goes faster as you collect a lot of coins.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love Smash. I understand why it was cancelled-ish, but the show has enough merit from me alone to keep going!!! Ugh. I will miss you broadway cast of Bombshell and Miss Me!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really fun game and very addictive. I love all the world tour updates it's really cool and the graphics are great. Highly recommended for 7+up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than Temple Run. More play options. Gathering jewels lets you continue a game that was lost for a slip of the fingers. Other aids help player feel successful. Speed get a little faster as you gather more experience.
1780721676|3.0|The read sounds convincing. In practice it is easy to follow. The 600 Cal possibilities seem generous. My suspicion is that you actually eat less on the days without restriction. But it didn't work for me. After several weeks and even cutting back more on the fast days I had not lost weight.
B000BO0QHW|5.0|The quality of the CD was very good and was all that I expected it to be.  Will order again.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I have had the free version on my phone for over a year now.  My daughter still loves to use it.  It always figures out who you are thinking about and usually amazingly quick.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I thought the first two books were better written. I did not like the ending and nothing was resolved. Disappointed but can't wait for the next book.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I have had the free version on my phone for over a year now.  My daughter still loves to use it.  It always figures out who you are thinking about and usually amazingly quick.
0385349831|4.0|Some parts of this really hit home with me and were very helpful. the rest of it was OK, but the book was worth reading just for the few parts I really liked.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|I can only review the first third of this movie because I could not bring myself to waste the time to watch the last two-thirds of this travesty.  I found the dialogue to be sophomoric and the acting wooden.  The story itself is so predictable.  It is as if the writers of the story watched Ricky and Lucy Ricardo, Ralph and Alice Cramden, Rob and Laura Petrie and even Fred and Wilma Flintstone and took their lives, peppered them with foul language and bathroom humor and then thrust it out on the public.  (Just a private note to the writers: the general public out there doesn’t talk like that all the time.  Find new friends!)<br /><br />If you have anything else to do (a root canal, a crisis, etc.), go do them.  You will enjoy them more than this exercise in stupidity.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Is difficult to believe how well this app works. I threw tons of obscure characters and people at it, and it got every single one correct. I thought it had made a mistake once, but it turned out I had answered a question incorrectly. For some questions you might need to check wikipedia to ensure you're giving the correct answer.<br /><br />On the permissions issue, I'm trusting Amazon to screen their FAOTD's for adware/spyware. Hopefully that trust is not misplaced.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Sticks close to Austen, superb performers and performances. Of all the screen versions of Persuasion, this one is the best.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Much more action packed but not at the expense of a great story.  Zombie killing is at a premium and the events in this season will leave you wanting more.
B0095P31L6|4.0|an animated film adults will enjoy.  I enjoy Johnny Depp and he does a great Rango.  Sometimes he seems to be playing his Pirates of the Caribbean role again and again....
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I had been living out of the country and was delighted to discover Fun.  I really like the album and the 3 songs that get radio play are all very good.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|It's a bit of a combination real and animated, which may not be or everyone's taste...  For me it  sort of missed the mark with the characters not quite fleshed out enough.  The story line was out of the 30's, and not some superman/super villain/super power story, although what Tintin does borders on superman'ish...
B0049J5EWW|4.0|My son was sick one day and home from school. He was a big fan of Cars so I figured give this a try. I had seen it when I was younger so I thought he would like. After just a few minutes he was hooked and it let him just rest on me for the length of the movie.
B0095P33IW|5.0|almost traditional Hollywood escapism from th 30's and 40's, , although villain is a litte over the top with supernatural power source... Chris Evans is likable as an average guy who rises to hero status..
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This movie holds special meaning to me in my life and I have no regrets buying it! Plus Liam is nice eye candy. ;)
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|An entertaining movie, I would give Leslie Mann 5 stars.  She so inoccently looks at the camera and what comes out of her mouth is hilarious.  Dead-pan humorous.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters with my best friend and his sister and laughed basically the whole time. I was expecting to be a Glee type movie but it was not that AT ALL. So good and very funny. I would recommend this movie for sure if you want a good laugh!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Day has out done herself again! 7.5 stars for Entwined with You! Everyone dreams of a man like Gideon Cross and this book is full of hot sex, true love, and emotional roller coasters! Once you pick this book up you cannot put it down! The waiting game begins again since there are 2 more books to come in the Crossfire Series.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Starwars on a single box full of high quality imagery. What more could one want? :) A must have for sci-fi aficionados.

B00COHAUD4|5.0|i like this one but it was not long for the plot but this also made the movie one of my favs
0316056898|3.0|I LOVE Tina Fey and this book definitely made me laugh a few times, but for some reason I was expecting more. She chronicles pieces of her life and sprinkles them with humor. Yet, she does not make the stories she tells personal. The read comes off even as a little stand-off-ish.<br /><br />She knows how to poke fun at herself, but has an incredible confidence about her and what she has accomplished. This is by no means a bad book. I just wished she had spent a little more time elaborating on some topics with more feeling and depth. Maybe it was because she did not want to sell out the people she worked with, but then again, if you are writing a story about your life you will need to talk about the people along the way.<br /><br />Good read, but don't expect this to be a gut buster.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|i love this alot i kind of want more movies to be made like this one about 75% of anyone will love this one
B0019TYQ38|5.0|I am not one much for love stories, but this film initiated me into the world of the Jane Austen novel. What is so engaging is the author and directors understanding of the universal romantic nature of what women find romantic.So much passion and fire, and not one kiss on the lips! Marvelous.By far, the best love story I have ever seen.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|This book is well written, as always, and has some delicate twists and turn. It however lacks the complexity of his older spy novels and has a somewhat obvious story line that is simply embellished by the language and typical characters. In this respect the book is rather predictable. Do not expect a tidy ending either. All in all I enjoyed reading this book but felt dissatisfied when I had finished it, almost as if there was really a lot more to come, but there wasn't.<br /><br />Not up to John le Carre's best standard but better than some of his last works.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Seriosly this is the best movie ever, its got romance, danger, and war.<br />How could you not love a movie that covers all aspects of life.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is my all time favorites tv series.  Micheal C Hall will always be Dexter for me.  I'm sad the series is ending.  :(
B003UBTX7C|5.0|The entire series of books in the Camel Club were excellent, and kept one's interest throughout each book.  Hopefully Mr. Baldacci will write another to continue the series.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|i love this game it is the best one on my kindle fire.Everyone get this game please.You will love it.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|By season 5 Star Trek the Next Generation was at a great level.  Character expression and storylines were fully developed.  I recommend this series!
B00081912E|5.0|The Mask and Liar Liar are my favorite Jim Carrey movies<br />Funny special effects<br />I loved his dog Milo, especially when he puts on The Mask
1878424319|3.0|Our beliefs differ too greatly for me to enjoy his book.  I will not be buying any more books from this author.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked how u think u know what's going on and then it all turns around. Really enjoyed this book
B004QSQMKE|5.0|The best parts of this movie had the devil (Tim Curry) in it.  This is what made the movie.  Visually stunning also.
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|The story is somewhat ok..  Mathew McConaughy gives a good performance.  A different and extreme violent character(Think original 'Bad Lt.&#34; but more extreme)<br /><br />  The Violence, especially against women, gets too extreme for me - and I watch slasher films
B001KOFH2G|5.0|The only problem with Serenity is that it came to an end. Sure be great if there was more to see in this series. Josh Whedon please consider continuing this series. It is too bad that Firefly/Serenity did not continue. With so much unimaginative garbage being produced out there, it is a shame that something with substance and continuity could not continue to draw support. Well done Josh Whedon here my vote for a sequel.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|I think this is the definition of the term Ensemble cast.  If I understand correctly was based on a play? They pull off a movie with basically only two rooms in the whole movie - And it works! Very well scripted fantastically acted -  all are at the height of their acting skills.<br /><br />A real delight to watch :)
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very informative and digestible. No pun intended. Haven't read the book yet by Michael Pollan but will be shortly. My kids loved it too.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Derivative of several other Sci Fi films( Fahrenheit 451, THX1138, etc. )<br /><br />Action is good story is very predictable.  Wanted to like it more,,, just an ok action film
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Every scene played out in my mind as though it were real.  I absolutely loved the fact that it was not predictable.  I only wish there was more to read, so sad it ended.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Fringe captures my attention because it is quite different from other series in the same genre. Fringe is quirky, dramatic and leads viewers to suspend disbelief.
B0099114WO|5.0|I bought this for my husband.....and made him watch it. Its funny and sincere and makes you laugh and cry.  Its Tommy Lee Jones and Merell Streep at their ultimate best.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I hate writing long reviews, however, due to all mixed reviews I believe this one deserve it.<br /><br />You know, when one takes the cake out of the oven, and it looks very yummy and good, golden brown, smells so good you just want to dig it...it seems perfect and then BAM! all of the sudden the middle crumbles, and then you frown, AWWW sadness...(sigh), but the edges are still in good shape? well, this is how I feel about this book, and I further explain.<br /><br />I LOVE GIDEON and Eva period. There is no core plot in this installment; nothing major happens aside from the fact that Eva and Gideon are trying to stay afloat, together against all odds. More and more of their lives AND THAT IS IT!; and just because I am a fan of this series I didn't get tired of it. I just wanted them; I missed them.<br /><br />I agree, there was no angst, no squeee!, no OMG! or WAO! WHAT! or OH Lord! you know...those exiting words we were used to from the previous installments, you will not say them here..only more Eva and more Gideon and this is the reason why the above YES and YES! My favorite sex scene was the one in the airplane VA VA VOOM!. I got the audio book and it is without a doubt an UBER different experience! believe when i tell you IT WAS psychosomatic! yes! the scene at the club it was great too, but oh boy...that black kiss put Gideon off the chain!and of course what happens at the island gets my biggest and last YES!<br /><br />I'm listening to this book for a second time, and now I realize ... and i do not know if anyone noticed? ... Do you remember when Brett kissed Eva? or when Christopher was provoking Eva? Or when Eva told him she was going away with Garrick? how odd it was that he didn't go bat-s*** frantic having a tantrum? I mean, Gideon is known for being bad tempered, caveman, macho possessive man! his passive progressive attitude was not the Gideon I am used to. This being said, i totally agree...I believe this was not the best! still think \\"Bared to You\\" was, but so many dots without being connected, and it didnt lead us anywhere.<br /><br />Also, what's with the prenup? What on earth has he done? What is it that he is completely sure Eva will leave him when she finds out?  I have no idea, NONE! But I am pretty sure we will find out on book 5, or who knows maybe in book 6, hope not in book 7 (who knows)<br /><br />There were some melodramatic parts that were a little overdone. Others, were like crossword puzzles...until you don't connect the dots you will not get the picture...Magumi, Brett, Monica, Victor...All shared a little bit of their own predicaments, in which it seemed each one of them had their own story to tell, however, were left out in the open, deliberately unfinished, to be answered in the next installments.  book.<br /><br />Now, here is where I say OH CRAP!..I have to wait for the next book and God knows WHEN will be out. I really DO NOT want this story to end. Honestly, I want to keep reading about Eva and Gideon until they have grandchildren and then some! but I am with everyone else...and here is were I draw the line, I DONT WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER SIX MONTH...from the bottom of my heart, there are so many books out there,so many series to keep up with that it gets tiresome This is a MAJOR PROBLEM, and I really wish publishers and authors understand how frustrated it is for us readers! series should be a month or two apart from one book to another to come out. THE COMPETITION IS excruciating; and as GIDEON AND EVA WOULD SAY... YOU NEED TO REVISIT AND REVISED! SPECIALLY THE PRICE.<br /><br />Anyways, enough with the heavy.

B008SVFX96|5.0|This guy is a genuine musician, his voice is magnificent, the guitar cords are so beautiful, it's a splendid piece of work Richie.
B00BY9GQHM|3.0|Up to almost the very end of the game, I loved it and really wanted to find out what was going to happen. BUT when I got to the part where the Postman is telling his story I couldn't get the last 4 objects I saved from the whole game to go into their assigned spots. I tried everything. I am so disappointed and wonder if anyone else had this problem. I was already to order #2 but sure won't now.
B00000612G|5.0|Once again, I think I would purchase everything this musician produces and shares with his fans, just a complete artist, who<br />does not take himself to seriously, he's so down to earth!!!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|The movie has a good premise but is lacking in any real depth. Apparantly, a long time ago, a woman ran away with her baby and jumped off of a cliff. She's been searching for her baby ever since... So when the two little girls are taken to a cabin by their father after he murdered their mother, where the father attempts to kill them, &#34;mama&#34; saves them. She takes care of them for five years until their uncle learns the girls' location and follows them as they relocate to the uncle's house. &#34;Mama&#34; gets jealous of the girls' developing relationship with the uncle and his girlfriend and attempts to murder them.<br /><br />The ending is a cliffhanger. SPOILER! &#34;Mama&#34; jumps off the cliff with one of the girls but leaves the other. Wooow!
0307352153|5.0|I read this book in three settings- it was so well-written and meaty. Great information for both introverted and extroverted types!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Absolutely, totally LOVED Tangled! I bought this on whim because someone had said it's comparable to Wallbanger by Alice Clayton, one of my favorites, but from a male's POV. It sure did not disappoint.<br /><br />Drew Evans is hilarious and witty. This book is truly funny. He's telling the story of how he met and subsequently got the \\"flu\\" from Kate Brooks. Drew is a NYC playboy, \\"never riding the roller coaster twice\\" if you know what I mean. He's never been in a committed relationship except for his relationship to his work. He's driven, passionate, and always get what he wants.<br /><br />When Kate Brooks knocks his socks off both personally and professionally, he doesn't know what hit him. One of my favorite scenes is when they both find out about the Anderson client and she puts him in his place. Kate is confident, funny, smart, and equally as witty as Drew; a great heroine. She never backs down because Drew doesn't intimidate her and I love that. They compliment each other so well, both forces to be reckoned with in the business world and to each other.<br /><br />Drew and Kate form a love/hate friendship which is sweet and hilarious. Their banter is classic, it's one my favorite aspects of the book. Before he can even realize what's happening, Drew's world is turned upside down and his comeback from that is quite romantic, telling, and equally hilarious. I laughed out loud through so many scenes of his groveling.<br /><br />The secondary characters were not lacking either. Drew's sister Alexandra is as funny as he and his niece Mackenzie made for a great character. She looks up to Drew and he holds nothing back from her. Their conversations are so cute and real.<br /><br />Tangled is extremely well written. I really enjoyed Drew's POV and how he engaged the reader constantly; always moving the story forward but pausing to give little tidbits about his family, his past, or his \\"philosophies\\". Seeing Kate through his eyes was really interesting. The story flowed really well always keeping me interested and many times laughing out loud. You should give it a try; brilliantly witty and well ... brilliant!
B004M5HUXE|3.0|well, been sold &#34;a-bill-of-goods&#34; . . . WTF ?!  only a few sorry-ass drawings . . . the text is o.k. bur I seriously expected some like 10 or 15 full page illustrations not some scrawny thumbnail sketches . . . Don't buy this (illustrated) version, stick with your imagination and the un(illustrated) ebook . . . so only 3 stars . . .
B0090KZDSK|3.0|It has to be said that first of all, I'm dissapointed to see so many US readers returning this book. Okay, it was lacking and yes, it left a lot to be desired but you really shouldn't punish the author by returning it simply due to you not enjoying it. You don't see a movie, dislike the ending or a character and then demand your money back?<br /><br />I started reading with an excited anticipation. I'd waited a long time for this novel and when it finally landed on my kindle, I dived right in.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect at all and what I got...surprised me. After enjoying the previous two novels in the series, I was dissapointed when I discovered that the majority of the novel was sex. Now, I like a good kinky scene as much as the next red blooded female, but with over three quatres of the book pure sex, it became...tedious. I found myself rolling my eyes and sighing with exhasperation each time Gideon and Eva were alone as inevitably, it usually ended with sex. Converations...sex. Fights...sex. Breakfast, lunch, dinner...sex. I'm surprised she didn't become hospitalised for exhaustion or over usage.<br /><br />The plot line itself also felt a little thin and I'm honestly struggling to find what it actually was. Their secret relationship which seemed not so secret to the reader? The murder case that seemed to pop up now and then but eventually die out. Eva's ex. Gideon's ex. Gideon's exes husband...it all seemed a little reaching and un-necessary. Considering Gideon was showering Eva with devotion, I found it hard to believe that she would so willingly meet with her ex and as he tells her in no uncertain terms that he wants to 'be inside her' she continues to spout on about being friends. Please? Really?<br /><br />Then as the book begins to close, we get a rushed array of sub plots thrown at us within ten pages. Mugami. Gideon's mother. Another ex. Carey and his on / off relationship. And then suddenly...the book ends. And how does it end? That's right...more sex.<br /><br />Sylvia Day did publically announce that this would not be the final book, however her publisher didn't release this statement and at the end of the novel we discover that there will be a further one or two novels.<br /><br />For me, it fell short of my expectations. Too many 'I love you, Angel' and 'I love you more' lines. Gideon seems to have lost that possesive, dark and hot alpha male persona I so fell in love with and I felt a little hurt to see him change so much. Grow yes, but don't lose yourself.<br /><br />In all, it was well written and detailed but if you were hoping for a thick plot and gasping twists and turns...I'm afraid this book is lacking.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire.  This app is the most used app on my device.  Accessing EBay with a browser has become a chore.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|After such an agonising long time waiting for this book, I can honestly say that the wait was worth it. I loved every second of Gideon & Eva's continuing story, and hope we don't have to wait as long for the next one.<br />The way the two of them have changed since the first book is great. I'm glad that there is a story to go along with all the hot sex in it.<br />I can't wait to find out what happens to them next and answer all the remaining questions.<br />Sylvia Day has done a fantastic job with this series. Love Gideon & Eva.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|a master story teller, as always.  I enjoyed the third book of the Clifton Chronicles, but the abrupt ending obviously means there is a fourth book on its way.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the fist book in this series, but refused to start the. Second until the third had been released!!  It is captivating and takes on a wild ride that is Gideon and Eva's relationship.  You will love going on this ride with them.  Now I'm off to read book 3- &#34;entwined with you.&#34;
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is captivating.  Page after page of honor betrayal lust envy etcetera. I love the way you are in the minds of the characters knowing their thoughts not just their words. Can't wait to get started on the second novel.

B0091THDOM|4.0|This case meets the functionality of protecting the phone and at the same time is professional looking.<br />It's hard to get a credit card in the slot outside once the phone is in though.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|By now everyone should know that it's not the last book as promised.. While I find that extremely irritating since she released that it was a trilogy I understand she has to make a living. But would a heads up be so hard.. Honestly the book was alright but it seemed thrown together. Where is the story going, the book felt like a filler in the series, a way to extends the crossfire series. I chose to return my book so the company and author would realize that  they need to be better about being so blatant about trying to make more cash as opposed to sticking with what they say & giving us an actual story (not a book with nothing really to add to the initial story).  I love the lead characters but its not worth the price honestly. I have to say I'm probably not doing to continue to read her work. Just remember if you are really unhappy about this book as a consumer if you want to do something about it you need to not buy it or return it.
B000QY9WOU|4.0|Five stars if the sound was better. Can heardly hear it. Past that Cher always puts on a fantastic show.

B005OYKI1I|5.0|Fast paced movie, lot of action keeps you on edge of your seat. I do feel it is better than Fast 6.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Firefly was creative, ground breaking television. There is still nothing like it today. Josh Weedon's vision of the future, with a message is real reality TV.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|But only if you understand the symbolism as Kuprick's imagery and dialogue operate on many levels.<br />Illumination comes from watching the film multiple times and and taking note of the errors in continuity which are actually not errors at all.  Paintings on the wall, props, address numbers and the layout of space all lead the viewer to the edge of the rabbit hole and on through the looking glass (mirror). The &#34;Rainbow&#34; costume shop is the tip of an ice burg that is submerged figuratively and literally in the subconscious.  How deep we go is up to us.<br />Once decoded I believe this to be one of Kuprick's most political films and reveals his courage towards the end of<br />his life.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great balance of acting, cinematography and graphics.  Looking forward to the next in the series.  I would recommend this movie.
B0040I09RM|5.0|What a great show.!!  show leaves you wanting more with each episode!! It's a must see for me!! I love it!!

1250007208|5.0|My first impression when I first heard about Cinder was \\"What?! Cinderella? A Cyborg? No way! I have to read this.\\" I've seen and read a lot of retells, re-envisions, and remakes of Cinderella but I never would have thought I'd actually read about a futuristic one - a cyborg Cinderella. It caught my attention right away but I was hesitant on reading it. I was so intrigued and amazed by the idea that I didn't want to risk being completely turned off if I find it not up to my expectations. I couldn't handle any more disappointments (dramatic, I know). If it wasn't for my challenges, I would have just kept postponing reading it.<br /><br />Cinder was very unexpected. I loved how it was not even close to the Cinderella that I grew up with. I can see how the essence of the characters were somewhat close but definitely not the personalities of the characters! The author succeeded in taking the essence of the Cinderella that we all know and transforming it completely into this awesome, ingenious, amazing new world in the future.<br /><br />Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.<br /><br />I loved Cinder! She's definitely one of my favorite characters of all time. She's so different from the clueless, too-kind, submissive Cinderella from the fairy tale. She's funny, lively, unapologetic, and she's an amazing mechanic - the best in her area!<br /><br />\\"I'm sure I'll feel much more grateful when I find a guy who thinks complex wiring in a girl is a turn-on.\\"<br /><br />As for the prince in Cinder, he was nothing like the prince from the fairy tale... No, wait, scratch that! I don't know anything about the prince from the fairy tale. His personality was never really described much - not even enough to actually make him a main character. But Prince Kai was another story! He was sarcastic, funny, strong-willed, and persistent. I loved his conversations with Queen Levana - it made me laugh!<br /><br />\\"Right,\\" said Kai, \\"that'll be no problem in a city of two and a half million people. Let me just go dig out my special Lunar detector, and I'll get right on that.\\"<br /><br />Two more characters I loved were Iko and Dr. Erland. Iko was adorable, cute, funny, very opinionated (for an android), and girly. Dr. Erland, on the otherhand, I'm thinking, is the fairy godmother of the story. I think about my grandpa when I read about him. He was wise and funny at times.<br /><br />\\"I'm not sure I would label it a `survivor,'\\" said Iko, her sensor darkening with disgust. \\"It looks more like a rotting pumpkin.\\"<br /><br />\\"Vanity is a factor, but it is more a question of control. It is easier to trick others into perceiving you as beautiful if you can convince yourself you are beautiful. But mirrors have an uncanny way of telling the truth.\\"<br /><br />I also liked how the stepmother had a reason for hating Cinder, unlike in the fairy tale where she was just evil. It might not have been a rational reason for hating her but it was a reason. Now as for Queen Levana, I hated her so much but I loved her character as well. She was just pure evil and talk about vanity!<br /><br />Cinder has a lot of potential and it's a very new concept to me. I can just hope that Marissa will take advantage of all it's potential and write more awesome sequels. It really deserves the 5 hearts I'm giving it (I would even give it 10 if my ratings go that far). I can't even express how much I loved this book and the concept. Marissa is a genius and her idea is so unique! This is probably the start of a new trend - awesome cyborg fairy tales. It can even be it's own genre!<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone! It doesn't matter what age group you belong to or what genres you like reading, if you know the Cinderella fairy tale, you should definitely read this. I loved it so much that when I have kids, I'll read them Cinder, instead of the Cinderella I grew up knowing.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please visit http://booksandbindings.com/and a half million people.

Marissa is a genius and her idea is so unique! This is probably the start of a new trend - awesome cyborg fairy tales. It can even be it's own genre!<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone! It doesn't matter what age group you belong to or what genres you like reading, if you know the Cinderella fairy tale, you should definitely read this. I loved it so much that when I have kids, I'll read them Cinder, instead of the Cinderella I grew up knowing.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please visit http://booksandbindings.com/
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a study of an era and a lifestyle that we will never see again. In season 2, we see the impact of the First World War on Downton Abbey. The war changes both the lives and the social protocols of the household. The family must adapt and participate in the war effort. After the war, the family confronts another calamity, the pandemic influenza attack of 1918. We enjoyed the Anglo-American rivalry in this family. The production values and casting are superb. This is royal soap opera at its best. Brew a pot of Earl Grey, put your feet up, pinkies up, and enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Good story, but predictable. Typical Sparks. Not really fond of his stories, but this one got so much publicity I gave it a try.  Learned my lesson!
B006RXPTNM|5.0|An excellent movie with a good story that is full of drama and suspense that keeps your interest at it's peak.
0385535147|5.0|I AM A BIG JOHN GRISHAM FAN AND ENJOY ALL HIS BOOKS. I LIKE ORDERING ON AMAZON ALL MY BOOKS WITH GOOD QUALITY.
0688145078|5.0|The book confronts a potentially difficult time for a soon-to-be big brother. It not only has a great story (and my son loves it!), but it is a great teaching tool, also. Highly recommended!
B00005K3OT|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. I ENJOY WATCHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE CD WEAR WELL AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY SCRATCHES.
193700788X|2.0|This book didn't seem to keep my interest like the others did.  I suppose I expected more since it was the last book in the series.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Found it a fascinating story that combined history and a tragic  love story. I was riveted! Made me want to take a trip to see all FLW's houses.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good plot and interesting characters. There are some disconnects in the story which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|When I ordered the kindle version of Game of Thrones I was really looking forward to using the x-ray feature (which is enabled according to Amazon).  Unless I'm missing something, it is not enabled - which is a shame since this epic tale would really benefit from that feature.<br /><br />Otherwise, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh Gideon, how I've missed you! Each book, we get to see a new layer to Mr. Cross, to his and Eva's relationship, and how they change each other. The sex gets hotter with each book, it's delicious to read about.  We get to see there is nothing G won't do for EVA, and we get to actually feel their love in this boom, beyond the panty sweating lust from the previous ones. I'm so happy this book won't be the end for these two...the question now is, how long until the next book!?  You've done it again Ms Day, thank you!!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I absolutley loved this book.  A co-worker told me about it and after reading I've gave copies to both my working and stay at home moms!  Highly recommend!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your chair and wanting to continue to watch the next episode then the next then the next...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have to begin by saying that I am very disappointed at the number of reviews which have been allowed for which the person states that they have not read the book.  This review system is meant to be a way that readers can find truthful opinions on the quality of the writing of a book.  Ms. Day announced quite a while ago that there would be five books in the series.  If you don't like it then don't buy it.  Send her a message through her website or Twitter.  She clearly listens to opinions seeing that the release of this book was postponed partially based on the response she got from fans that were disappointed that the printed copies were released so much later than the digital copies for the first two installments.  Many fans are thrilled that she is taking her time in developing the relationship between Gideon and Eva.  If you truly feel like she is taking financial advantage of her fans, again don't buy it.<br /><br />Now, having actually read the book, I would like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I loved that Gideon and Eva were more willing to fight conflict together.  It was a wonderful progression of their relationship.  They were apart for so much of Reflected that I needed them to have this time together.  They have a new sweetness and playfulness.  Those that have said that the sex scenes were repetitive of the previous books clearly did not read the entire book.  There was some hotness and pushing of boundaries in their love lives.  It was a very enjoyable read.  There is no doubt that $9.99 is a lot to pay for a digital book.  I feel that the Crossfire series is one of the few examples where it is worth it!
B000Q67876|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies. When I see it on tv, which it is on plenty, I watch it again. Nice of them to put it on Blu-ray.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I tried to download this app and it did not help and I still cannot play videos on my Kindle Fire. I am a little frustrated with this product because it does not work!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The acting in this movie was WHY better then the mediocre acting in the twilight series and the special effects where better as well
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|Simple read, easy to understand and practice. I have gifted this book to more than a dozen people. This is a gift for life.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great. If you prefer not to spend any money, you can get the free version, which has less sounds and does not have the sleep-helping sounds I like, but is still a good app. I got the free version and the next day got the full version because I liked it so much.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Acting is excellent, scenery is beautiful  but most of the videos is interrupted somewhere near middle to say Amazon is reloading; and  the picture gets fuzzy at certain points but my worst complaint is that I cannot get the sound loud enough to hear comfortably.  All other of my audio is fine.
B003RNXIBK|5.0|Another great album from Eminem. Heard this album way back and decided to purchase it. Great purchase. Use it to work out with very motivational!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I've read all the Sookie books, even those that were not very good, but the final book I want my money back on. Since I was worried that this book would fall short like many others, I skipped to the end just to see who Sookie ends up with. No spoilers, but I thought the end was terrible and didn't even waste my time on the rest.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|this the version of this story keep you on the edge all the way and show the good never get what they what
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so disappointed to read the reviews.  Specifically that this not the end and creating interest with Brett.  Creating drama just to extend the series does not sit well with me.  I'm so tired of having to wait for the sequel.  Suffice it to say I'm skipping this sequel, perhaps read thefinal oneand hopefully  it gets back on track with the amazing romance told in book 1 & 2.
B002XHN776|4.0|Found the album by accident. It was on my step-daughter's old mp3 player. The mp3 player was broke and I could'nt add any new music so I was stuck listening to a bunch of crap. That is until I found this whole album on it.The type of album you can listen to all the way through. If you like good music you will not be disappointed.
B008JFUMDS|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />As the credits started rolling at the end of Now You See Me there was one feeling that overwhelmed all others, the feeling of being misled. The promotional trailers all lead you to believe that the film is going to be about one thing, but in reality it's about something else entirely. I don't know why, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. The more I thought about it the more I felt like Now You See Me just didn't live up to its full potential.<br /><br />That's not to say that it's a bad movie, though. On the contrary, Now You See Me manages to keep you entertained for majority of its lengthy two hour running time. What got to me, though, was that you see very little of what I thought were the four leads: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henly Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). Instead, a lot of focus is put on Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Alma Vargas (Melanie Laurent).<br /><br />That's where I think they kind of lost me. I think Louis Leterrier wanted to take this movie in a different direction than what most people are expecting and it's going to have a lot of people leaving disappointed. Instead of focusing on these four magicians and the repercussions of robbing a bank, they tried to create some convoluted plot that revolves around who got these four together and why (s)he is asking them to do these things in the first place. Which is fine, but don't advertise the movie as one thing only to have a completely different set-up.<br /><br />Still, I must admit that even with the somewhat lackluster plot I was impressed by how well they covered every little detail. Usually movies like this leave some major plot-holes or a group of unanswered questions, but every question in Now You See Me gets answered by the end of the movie. Which was nice because as the movie was progressing I said to myself, \\"So we're just going to forget that this happened? We're not going to discuss this any further?\\", but, thankfully, everything got covered eventually. This also allowed the audience to feel like every little detail in the plot was important because, in the grand scheme of things, they were.<br /><br />What annoyed me the most, however, was the inclusion of an extremely out-of-place romantic side story between Rhodes and Vargas. Some movies call for these things while others, like this one, don't. The relationship is just completely unnecessary and it does nothing substantial to help progress the plot. Vargas' involvement in the story as a whole was slightly significant, but the little romantic tension just felt tacky and forced. Note to any aspiring film directors/writers: Not every film needs romance! In fact, some films will wind up better without any romance at all, Now You See Me being a prime example of this.<br /><br />Perhaps this film's strongest attribute is its cast. You have an all-star lineup consisting of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Woody Harrelson. Four fantastic actors who deliver once again by giving the audience an engaging and fun performance. Then you have Michael Cain with a pretty minor role and Dave Franco with what's probably his first really big role. Out of everyone involved Franco in particular stood out the most to me. I've grown to love Eisenberg over the years, Harrelson is always a blast, and you can never go wrong with Freeman, but Franco just knocked it out of the park in this movie. Still, I wish that he, along with the other three magicians, received more screen time. The four of them had fantastic chemistry that was never really utilized.<br /><br />Finally, the film's score, composed by Brian Tyler, leaves a lot to be desired. In terms of the film itself it does its job, but as a standalone score it does nothing new or inventive. In fact, almost every piece I heard in this movie felt like a rip-off of some other big budget action film. There was no originality, no creativity, and, most importantly, it just lacked its own identity. Probably one of the weakest and most generic film scores I've heard in quite some time.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - I think my main issue with this film is that I felt duped. The magic was nice and it was cool to see them break it down and show you just how \\"real\\" magic is, but beyond that the experience as a whole just felt underwhelming. I wanted to be taken to amazing places and I wanted to be wowed, but at the end of it all I was just left with the feeling of \\"meh\\". So it didn't live up to my expectations, and that's ok, but if you felt even the slightest bit interested after seeing the trailers then I recommend you give it a shot. It's a nice ride from start to finish, but don't expect to be blown away by the experience.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Graphics were awesome. Movie was an improbable situation for the characters but it was an interesting battle between good and evil.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down. Very smart and funny. I recommend it to all of my friends.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am so confused by all of the bad reviews for this book. Especially the ones complaining because its not the last one....REALLY!!!! She said on her website before this book came out that it was NOT the last one....so if you didn't know that it's your own fault. And who would complain about more Gideon!!!!!!! This book was raw, primal, sexual and so good in so many ways. There was a couple of the most beautiful scenes I have read in any book....ever....and I read 200 books last year. Did Eva make a couple of stupid choices...yes....did it make a difference in her and Gideons relationship....no....in fact something happens in this book that is so satisfying I can't even explain how great it was!!! All those who sent such horrible reviews need to go back and re-read this book...maybe the whole series and then see how it truly does fit in perfectly!!!! Don't believe them....buy it, read it and love it!!! Can't wait for more!!!!!
B007IK44CK|4.0|I like all of the action mixed in with the drama this movie is worth buying and watching over and over again over a period of time
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Very Entertaining, Exciting, and eye opener. Jamie Fox and Leonardo did a excellent job with their acting skill in this movie.
B00BKBCM4A|5.0|she was more than i expected, she sings in a similar style to sade. i am anticipating more from her.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Let me start by saying, I'm glad I knew before I started reading that this was going to be a 5 book series. If I started reading this thinking this book  was the end this book would have been 1 or 2 stars. I didn't realize how many loose ends there were until I started reading this book. Going in with the mindset, this is not the end, allowed me to enjoy this book more. I like how Gideon and Eva are communicating more and not keeping secrets.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app allows me to download Kindle books to my Android pad.  Easy to use and is seemless.<br />2 more words required.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|So glad to own one of my favorite movies! Glad that it is available on Blu-ray... can watch it over and over.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|I chose to give this dvd 4 stars because of the amount of action in it and the special effects. The acting is good but it could have been better for some characters. And I am very happy that the master of the house let them believe that he did not know what was happening but as he says, he knew all the time.<br />And we miss you Andy!! Great job man!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I purchased this as an addition to the Bond 50 year collection as a gift since it wasn't included when it was released in 2012, got it at a pretty good price, so I'm pleased.
B0072OFM28|5.0|All i have to say is : Nasir and Agron. The way they look at each other and kiss each other. Woud I recommend this dvd? Yes i would.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Was very excited to get a full collection of the first 6 movies, but when it came in one was missing.  I was really upset to say the least, especially since it was the first one.  Luckily, when I called Amazon, they took care of it for me at no charge.  Great collection and great value!
0811870413|5.0|Love it! Have become addicted to trying different breads, and all have been successful, different, and delicious. Also fun to read.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Great flash to work with. I purchase this flash to take pictures on my vacation. It made my pictures come out wonderful.
B0039O8AQK|5.0|when this book was published no one thought it held an idea that could never happen. this is probably the 3rd time i have read this book and each has been scarier than the last. i believe we are moving ever closer to the realiyt of this book. Big Brother is watching us constantly through traffic cameras, airport searches,etc.<br />i have a very uneasy feeling as to where we are heading and if the fiction of this book, will in fact become a reality
B0031RS42K|1.0|Far too self-congratulatory, I fully expected Brown to be like Clive Cussler and work himself into the story. He sets up a wonderful idea then allows too many happy accidents to extricate the protagonist.<br />That said he has certainly done his research abd sales of Dante must be soaring.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|i like it because it is interesting and strange. itopens my mind to all possibilities, unacknowledged by the majority of people. i have always walked a different path and this suits my personality
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|GREAT MOVIE. WOULD WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SECOND ONE TO COME OUT IN THEATERS. MUST WATCH.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|my grandson had fun didnt take long to learn how to play can fly around without hitting everything in the room
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this games it easy u go to states u never been............................and Miami is a beautiful place to go it feel like I am there
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I let my seven year old Grandson down load this one onto my Kindle. He loves it as does his older brother.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It updates and you are in a different city with different charaters, trains, and boards.  The thing never lags and the graphics a fun too. Absolutly fantastic.
1451695195|5.0|This is an amazing description of the spirit that God created in us all.  The individual human spirit or soul lives despite what happens to the body.  Proof of Heaven is proof of that reality!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am a teen who loves the game. I have my little brother, mom, cousins, and their moms and siblings playing as well. I love the colors and hoping the next one would be in Mexico Or Paris. You keep up the good work and i'll keep playing. Rate: 5/5
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This guy is great. I listen to him all the time in the car.<br />Shipped very fast. Good price!<br />I would buy again.
B0000028M7|5.0|This is one of Alice in Chains' best releases. Dirt is slammed with killer tracks and has an excellent flow.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was definitely a page turner. Such twists & turns. Who can think of this stuff? It  was a little disturbing to me. The characters really pulled you in.  Toxic twins could describe these two
B0067R0APK|4.0|We love this app. It is easy to use and is 98&middot;9% accurate. It offers so much information about every type  often weather and then some. This app includes radar (Doppler, satellite, and street/storm watchers), all are easy to use.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I said it all on the top very disappointing. Not the type of game I was able to get on my iPad.
B00574PQDU|5.0|Interesting story well acted.  I enjoyed the chemistry between Damon and Blunt and found the premise of the movie intriguing.  The pace of the film was also good.  Killer soundtrack by Thomas Newman.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My 3 year old just loves to watch this series.  And lucky for him, my husband & I find it quite amusing as well.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Obviously good chemistry between Rudd and Mann (who is an underrated actress, I think).  Some scenes (I won't admit which) hit close to home.  If you watch it with a spouse you'll catch yourself trying to gauge his/her reaction.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I especially like tracks 1,2,6,9 and 12. Only two of the songs are Boz originals (1,12) but they are excellent. His cover of Steely Dan's Pearl of the Quarter is great. Highly recommend this album if you like or love the Boz.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I watched this series on TV and had to purchase the DVD to watch again. This show is good enough that my husband even watches it with me -- not only for ladies. Very funny.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Another badass album from a badass band!! If your any kind of QOTSA fan, GET IT NOW!!! All kinds of emotions going on in this album....
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Megadeth is FINALLY back - mostly.  Yes, long gone are the days of 'Deth's first four albums, the thrash/speed metal days, and those were good days - but - Megadeth has put out some awesome albums since then, too.  Personally, I absolutely love The System Has Failed and United Abominations, and actually, aside from Risk and Cryptic Writings, I love all the previous 'Deth records EXCEPT the horrible Endgame and Thirteen - ugh!  I could not stand the last two albums.  Super Collider, however, I can honestly say is fantastic.  Really, truly - it's good!  Really, really good.  Perhaps not GREAT; perhaps not AMAZING; but it's not a led-down by any means.  In fact, all the tracks from 1 through 8 are super awesome, and 11 to be a good one as well (Cold Sweat), and really only found 9 and 10 to be sort of so-so/filler.<br /><br />So, how is Super Collider?  Great lyrics as always, heavy, melodic (yes, in a good way), no real memorable riffs or speed-riffs (except for track 6, Dance In the Rain), but certainly some memorable rhythm riffs, and Dave sounds snarly and awesome as usual.<br /><br />I have thought that in recent years, Megadeth has put too much focus on singing and lyrics, and perhaps they still do a bit in this case, but honestly, this is a really good, heavy, fun, nice sounding album.  It's way, way, WAY better than their last two albums, and just as good as anything after Youthanasia.  Enjoy.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|First off this album will not rip your face because its not going at mach 10. No its a Metal album with solid ballads, hard rock and metal. Its dynamic and the fact is after listening to it about 10 times now I like 6 songs. I have been a fan from 1986. Saying this though doesn't mean I like everything Dave has put out there. The reason I give this record 5 stars is because I haven't liked anything this much since United abominations. Its nice to see all the negative press all over the web because really it comes down to the a simple fact Megadeth delivered content that is very different and thoughtful.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After seeing that the majority of reviews were negative, I returned this book without even reading it.  I refuse to spend $9.99 since there are now 2? more books in the trilogy?? series. I might repurchase this book for no more than 99 cents! Sylvia Day is not winning any fans with this move.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This movie was great! I loved the music, animation and characters! Although I felt they didn't need so many characters, maybe there were some pointless ones thrown in. But nothing that worked against the movie, the story was great too! After watching the movie, it has inspired me to travel to Rio someday! The soundtrack is also a worthy investment. If you like this movie, you might also like Ferngully: The Last Rainforest and Disney's The Lion King (lol, very different I know, just throwing ideas out there)
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Each of the tracks are enjoyable.  I know what I like and I love this album/CD.  I also bought their last full album/CD and this is in the same vein but this is even better.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Very interesting and entertaining. Takes you back to the \\"good ol days\\" of rock and roll with a nastalgic feel. The movie has all the great legends in it with an awesome sound track. This is a must see.
B002VECM72|5.0|The Blind Side has quality acting and teaches good family values.  This is a movie I wanted added to our family movie library so that we can enjoy it for years to come.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hated waiting so Long for this book,but it was worth it.....glad hear there will be more. Just hoping we don't have to wait as long!!!!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I would have given this game 5 stars but it is the same game played over and over again. Maybe it's just me but I got bored after a while.<br />That said, it drew me right in and you can compete against yourself.
B00BF11STU|4.0|I guess only a few will know if it went down like that and if it was really BL...but it got the heart pumping.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|It was all that I expected to be. It was great. It tolled the hole story but it did not give the history of the other members of the band it mostly explained about Don & Glen
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book! It was very different from anything I had read before but still kept my attention and I felt like I knew the characters!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|ive been waiting to get a gift card to get it but now its free, it can guess almost anything
B003H4I4JU|2.0|If Ender's game has value 10 then Speaker for the Dead has value 1/4. Too long and too boring dialogs - in my opinion.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This documentary is excellent...<br />Allison Eastwood did a great job directing the hundreds of pieces of film, interviews and music to make this the bench mark of band bio pics......<br />A must for music fans of  70s and 80s rock fans and an obvious 'must have' for every EAGLE fan around the world!
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|I'm not a musician, I'm a chef. I know what drives and inspires me in the kitchen through prep, clean up and long 16 hour days. Queens of the Stone Age have long been contributors of my kitchen ambience, and ...Like Clockwork is no exception. Contributors to the end product include Dave Grohl, Mark Lannegan, Trent Reznor and old bandmate Nick Olivieri who was apparently cleaned up enough to make it to the studio.<br />Quite simply, ...Like Clockwork rocks. It demonstrates the complexity and layering you've come to expect, as well as a maturity and sense of restraint that weren't always there back in the Kyuss days.<br />I've looked forward to the album, and filled in the time since the last album having seen Eagles of Death Metal open for The Strokes, seen Them Crooked Vultures on the second night of the tour but definitely neither the same as the masterwork here. Noisy, punchy, all out angular and at times quietly sinister.<br />Queens of the Stone Age are up to no good, and I like it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|When I saw the game, it just looked like a easy game.y but as I got into the game,it looked fun and addicting. And I was right and right now, I'm on episode 2, with 111 creations and 15 groups too.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This movie is so much fun to watch.  The transfer to Blu Ray while not perfect - was very nice.  I will now enjoy it in high definition for years to come.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it. Great game..my husband and I play every morning together...we have. A great time. Coffee time fun. It also provides great competition.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This is a TIMELESS Classic that has a very unique catchy ending!  If you like old classic horror movies this is THE ticket!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love his voice and choice of material. It's so nice to have a real, honest-to-goodness crooner on the charts again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This.is a.good.game because it is interesting and it changes season also it has missions unanimously get to collect coins and you can flimgoes if you collect all of them you can get a prize
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Best thing hes done since the first AMERICAN SONG BOOK . Glad to see (hear) he's writing again. If you are a parent, the last cut will make you cry!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an addicting game to play and is fun cause you'll keep playing till your kindle is dead cause it's so good!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Bought this on a wim and so glad I did. It's truly one of his best CDs - lots of just perfect songs. New material - with one reference to Maggie Mae! Lots of wisdom in these lyrics.  You'll enjoy it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was amazing and very touching.  This book is an action book also. it was a cool book. IT IS AN AWSOME SEQUAL
1603425381|5.0|I'm edging fleece blankets - these are all beautiful, well written and charted. Good book for your collection - you'll have a good reference book with this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I barley got this game and I can't put it down! I mean when you get it you will play for at least 2 or 3 hours!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The cast is very talented, the stories engaging, the settings and costumes are lavish.  Well worth the time, great entertainment.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|C G A SHARP AND D SLOW<br />ITS GOOD AT LEFT TO THE MIIDLE OF THE PIANO SO TRY IT PAEACE
B00CHVJODE|5.0|For overall entertainment, I would give the movie 4 stars, but because of the father's exemplary role of a loving parent who goes to great extent to love and protect his family ( including his mouthy mother-in-law ) I give it 5. Basically, the Crood family must leave their cave dwelling which has kept them safe from the myriad dangers they face daily when their home is crushed to pieces. The daughter is tired of being in the cave already and wants to live in the sun instead of fear. The family has an adventurous trek in the search for a new home in their prehistoric environment. Caution: Watch out for tar pits.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's just as good as the original. I love WW2 stuff, and this app is great for me. This game is epic, and I recommend it for all World War II fans.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Rise of the Guardians celebrates the magic of childhood on the premise that it is precious and should be protected. Cool. The film puts a creative spin on childhood heroes, or guardians, of special holidays and events like Santa, Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy, etc. The Guardians team up to fend off the evil force of darkness that brings fear and bad dreams. They actively recruit the young Jack Frost to meet the challenge. Jack's memory about his past is sketchy, but when it does finally return, you understand why he is the perfect complement to the Guardians.
B00138KJY0|5.0|great music! I had the record back in the day. glad to have it again. People should get this. I am glad I did.
B00821OX98|5.0|Can't wait for the next season! The characters and the story is very well done. It jumps right in with the story so it is a bit difficult to know what is going on but great once you get caught up with everything.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like the concept, but for me the game was too short. I would like if the next one has more chapters. Dissent characters also.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Loved the Soggy Bottoms Boys and their interactions with every character they came across. Dan Goodman, superb as cyclops. GREAT!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|As a gift of a dying friend who was so delighted to get the &#34;War Horse&#34; She loved it. I had already owned a copy purchased from a store locally at a much higher  price. Next time I'll wait to buy. Thanks you for being so speedy in shipment.  Beatrice Green
B0081336FO|5.0|Outstanding show:<br />Sherlock is a great series  I have my fingers crossed that there will be a season 3 coming soon.
B003VIWO9I|4.0|i had been reading the Tiffany Aching series to my seven-year-old.  The little blue men's shenanigans are adorable, and the books were quite appropriate for him.  So I was more than a bit surprised when I started reading this fourth volume to him, and walked straight into some material that is absolutely not suitable for a young child.  In fact, it's probably the most un-child-friendly content I've seen in any Pratchett book, and I think I've now read them all.<br /><br />I stopped reading the book to him, and read the rest myself and loved it.  Thoroughly enjoyable and much better than The Wintersmith (my least favorite in the series).<br /><br />Regarding what age teen or pre-teen this book is suitable for (SPOILER WARNING):<br />Near the beginning of the book, a pregnant teenage girl is beaten by her father until her unborn baby dies.<br />So you can judge whether your child is ready for that.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|I wanted more Pumpkins and got it.  Unfortunately, I don't think they are as good as they once were.  I shouldn't be surprised.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|makes working with fractions a breeze.  simple and so easy to use. I will share this with my grandkids who have a lot of fraction homework
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book, although I found myself frustrated with the whole love conflict. Make up your mind Katniss Everdeen, JESUS FREAKING CHRIST!! I don't care who you like more just pick someone and shoot some arrows.....
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I wish that it was possible to give zero stars because I would.  The first to books were alright, 4 stars, and I waited for this and sorry I did. I tried but I could only get through a couple of chapters.  Some believe that you should not review unless you read the whole book, I on the other hand that you should review if you can only go a couple of chapters.  This book did not grab me from page one or any other page I read.  Sorry folks but save money and do not buy this book.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie is simply enchanting. The beautiful art of Beatrice Potter is so well portrayed along with wonderful acting and a really fine story. All in all it is as I mentioned before, it is &#34;simply enchanting.&#34;
B00BF11STU|3.0|The true story is so interesting that it makes you want to know more about it. The movie is pretty good, but nothing great. The storm on the compound at the end makes the movie worth watching.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag came in a camera and lens bundle, but we have been very pleased with it.  It has well laid out adjustable space inside for a camera and several lenses, as well as outside pockets to hold odds and ends.  It appears to be of good quality and is very comfortable to use for long hikes, you can even stash some non-camera items in it.
B000X9A6TS|5.0|I had heard of Hawkwind before; I had never had a clear idea what they were.  Psychedelia, Jam Band, Space Rock, Noise?  Sure; all of the above.  But after reading an A/V Club review of this album in a recent issue of the Onion weekly, I decided to roll the dice.  It's not for everyone, but give it a try.  You might be surprised to find yourself rocking out, spacing out, jamming out to this album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like solitaire,  you will love this app.  I am truly addicted to this game and find it hard to put down my Kindle Fire when playing this game... Enjoy
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Best Star Trek Movie Ever! From hells heart I stab at thee! For Hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Still don't understand the need for the detailed description of the battle of Waterloo but enjoyed it all the same.To me the one constant with Hugo is that he never lets you get comfortable in your world view. He is constantly exposing the reality beneath what we BELIEVE to be true.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|In a panel discussion at the Paley Center Julianna Margulies expressed that she had some initial concerns that viewers would not become engaged with such a \\"smart\\" show. To the contrary, it is a pleasure to watch a show crafted by such smart actors and writers. Each episode is rich and complex.  The core cast is big enough that their personal relationships usually succeed in keeping the show from becoming formulaic. The only complaint I have is the recurring characters - their personality quirks are in strong contrast to the complex personalities if the regulars. Otherwise I would rate this season of the Good Wife as one of the best television productions ever.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|really enjoy this cd, keep em comin' LA.  to be honest didn't care for downtown the first time i heard it.  i'm glad the song grew on me otherwise, i would have missed out on all the other songs on this cd.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Its eerie and very strsnge to me how much they want to access in exchange for this application. They stop just short of needing to know your social security number and credit card information. If you'd asked me (and I'm not into conspiracy theories) theres something very fishy going on with this &quot;seemingly harmless&quot; app.
B000MV9026|5.0|Love this movie and watch it over and over with my grandchildren.  The music and dancing is just plain fun.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Still a guitar player supreme.  I am not normally a fan of team-up albums by legends, but John pulls it off.  I especially liked the Keith Urban and Brad Paisley offerings.
0061120073|5.0|i laughed and cried with this book.  Betty Smith was a genius in writing novels about true life.  I want to read the  other books.
031620157X|5.0|He's an amazing actor and now - to my surprise - author!!! Bring on Struck by Lightning. Can't wait to see how his writing career progresses.
B009R659L8|5.0|This is, as always, wonderfully mind-blowing Mary Higgins Clark.  I have always liked her books, and this does not disappoint.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I currently do not have a gym membership so this DVD helps me stay on track with my fitness at home. It has a good mix of cardio and strength training for a 20 minute session.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would never normally watch, let alone enjoy, anything described as a \\"soap opera.\\" But the charcterization in Downton is so compelling, the conflicts and plot points so engrossing, and the setting - that dramatic slice of history in which the whole world was fundamentlly changing - so tranporting, that I am close to seeking out a 12 step program - so \\"addicting\\" has it become. More than that, this is a drama that both stays with you and makes one feel a little better about life.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I liked this immediately from the get go.  I wish I had had something like this back in the day!  Rarely do I need to use fractions now so when I will there is no worry that I could not figure anything out FAST AND CORRECTLY! Tried it on compound fractions and it was like magic...shall never hesitate to use it when the occasion presents itself.  Would also work as a primer for remembering how to add,subtract, etc.  fractions of different values! Decimals too!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|interesting app which I have had some fun with.<br />always fun to go back and edit past pics in my phone with the different textures.
B0090EJR1K|3.0|This movie could've done with a better plot and better characters to go with. I feel there's so much more that they could've done. In the end it's just a movie with a few good scenes..
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Definitely one of the best documentary I have seen in recent times. Keeps you glued to the screen till the end. And very nicely scripted and directed. Excellent effort
0785168109|5.0|if you want to see all the design of iron man costume, you must have it & wont be disappointing!
B001EBROWQ|5.0|Watch this movie every Easter. It is hard to top the 1960's grandeur of film making on the epic scale. Funny that Charleston Hesten makes an attempt at taking the lime light from Jesus by portraying John the Baptist as an action hero. REPENT!
B001EN71DQ|5.0|A great epic experience to watch again and again. Highly recommended...for any family looking for an exciting,amazing trilogy .try it!!!!
B005DNPJKU|5.0|I don't know what hurts more, knowing that it is based on a true story or John Hurt's optimistically tragic portrayal of John Merrick. Sir Anthony Hopkins was perfect. This is a beautiful film, period.
B000JMKO0A|4.0|The main character was very compelling. The things that happened to her, the choices she made, were all believable. The ending was quite satisfying and felt like she'd come full circle. It's one of those books that help you learn to be more sympathetic to other people and the choices they may have to make.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Django unchained was a great movie. Quinten is an amazing director like no other. It's not &#34;for the whole family&#34; but it was right up my alley.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I purchased this because I wanted something funny ..really funny to read.  Since Tina wows me with her humor on TV I thought it would just be a &#34;given&#34; that the book would do the same.  Not so.  In fact .. some chapters I started I just skipped over. Sorry, Tina Fey..just not a hit.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Very intelligent, compelling show.  You never know what he is thinking about.  He is such a complex guy. Very elegant, refined and sophisticated.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Awesome game but finished it in one day.  Not enough levels.  Need to get more room.  Not worth the dollar I paid.
1469220717|5.0|Gideon and Eva continue their journey, so make sure you have your passport because you are going to need it!  As the bond between these two complicated souls deepens, we are brought along to witness how the story unfolds.  I have to applaud Sylvia for not rushing the storyline of these characters.  We have only been apart of their lives for a very short time.  Gideon and Eva still have so many obstacles to overcome and only Sylvia Day can tell their story the way it is meant to be told.  The book is HOTNESS all over the place.  You will not be disappointed by the latest from Gideon and Eva's tale.
B00BY9GQHM|3.0|It was just ok. Lots of dark scenes, made it very hard to find items. Disappointing. Played better games before.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Like most of the others like it, you have to pay to continue after a certain point. Still a fun game to play the same parts over and over.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have never had a knife that I felt comfortable enough to use in to beat on and still be able to use in more delicate cutting situations such as cutting up meat and whittling. Batoning 3 to 3.5 inch logs poses no problems, even if you have to go through very knotty wood. I have batoned 40 to 50 logs for cooking, after that I can still whittle and make feather sticks without the need for resharpening. The knife will retain an edge. After a quick touch up I am able to easily prepare meats and cut and chop vegetables. My machete may handle some tasks better and my smaller hunting skinning knife may be somewhat better at others. However, presently I feel if that given the choice to carry one knife, I'm taking the Becker BK2.<br /><br />Jon
B00062RCBW|5.0|There are fans that might argue which of the Star Trek franchise is the best, this in my humble opinion is it. The writing is excellent and the personalities are rich and well developed. Yes it is fantasy, but there are so many relevant story lines that reflect timeless issues and quandaries that will apply no matter the star date! The packaging is good and very protective of the discs. (Which is not always the case in complete season packages). ENGAGE!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Well I  Loved this book so much it was Just keep gettin  better an  better .I have plenty of my favorite quote s but the one I loved the most was The last I checked  the wife I married was petite  and voluptuous thks Sylvia
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it was difficult to put down.  Nicholas Sparks does it again.  I cannot wait to watch the movie.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Bloody good fun! Just enough humor, maybe not too gory. With the current trend of overkill bloodbaths and brain stomping, this focuses more on story. It seems everyone in the precinct is a bit of a ****up!!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|very interesting book !  Find a lot of information regarding the previous years before the 1rst WORLD WAR and the after consequences that could help us understand why a HITLER had a place in this world
B008JJM88Q|5.0|4 years of android apps and I've never done a review, but thus app is amazing. Hacent been able to stump it yet
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I do not have a horse of my own so.... now I have an electronic one...<br />Fun game, a good time waster.  My only pic... this is obviously a game made for right handed people... not super important, unless you're left handed.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Great story and as always, Michael Connelly always keeps you guessing and wanting more. Off to read the next in the series of The Lincoln Lawyer.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|This app has very invasive permissions. I will not take the risk for a silly game app.<br /> Advise you avoid this one.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Unfreakingbeleivable. He guessed Ivan Drago from rocky 4 on my first try. After about maybe questions. Ol boy is a &quot;G&quot;. Great app
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it!  I enjoyed reading this book! It makes you really ponder upon your own life! Sometimes we just need that as humans!
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book series so I was looking forward to the movie. This was the first movie I rented on my kindle fire and the quality of movie was good. The movie itself was not as reflective of the book as I would have liked many of the key main characters are missing. I hope they do better with the next one if they make it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie about John Carter, a character from the 1912 novel, A Princess of Mars, is thoroughly satisfying in every way. The idea of entanglement, a single body occupying different spaces simultaneously (in this case, planets) goes far beyond Star Trek's warp drive or transporter to imagine a travel that was much more revolutionary. Even Schroedinger, who refined the concept of entanglement (Verschraenkung), did not articulate his theories until 1935. The novel tells the tale of Dejah Thoris, brilliant and beautiful Princess of Helium, a city on Mars (aka Barsoom). She is rescued by John Carter, a Civil War hero adventurer transported to Mars unwittingly to eventually change everyone's destiny. Lavishly produced and beautifully acted, the movie will go down in history as Disney's finest achievement and best-loved movie. It might take some time, however, to erase initial  box office disappointment. It barely broke even on a huge budget. But, like the Wizard of Oz, will endure to become one of America's most popular features. The characters are well developed and interesting. Some of the performances are first rate, including those of Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Lynn Collins and Taylor Kitsch. The warm, three dimensional personalities they create are as resonant and endearing as anything in Twain. That's not something one can say about many science fiction movies. Certainly, Mark Strong's, Matai Shang, will not be exceeded for intelligent villainy or jaded intensity any time soon. You know a performance is great when it seems the actor was also the writer. I encourage anyone to buy the film in Blue Ray to savor the mesmerizing visuals in all their glorious detail. When it comes down to choosing one dream world over another, my vote goes to the movie that features its heroes and heroines \\"sailing on light\\" in exquisite, dragonfly-like airships.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|This is a superb suspensful, chair gripping movie. Steve Zahn really surprised me in this film with his acting skills. Most movies I have seen of him are comedies so it was really nice seeing him play such a monster in this movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen so help me God.<br /><br />I didn't like it because it was convoluted, jarring, and confusing. The dialog was inane and almost stupid and the plot, was weak. The directing was terrible. The musical score was uninspired. The visuals were not good enough to be redeeming. Avoid this title if you can.
0345536886|3.0|I found it to be a rather mundane novel as far as Gricham books are concerned. He may have spoiled us with his past works.
0425263924|5.0|I love the book!!! I love this series!!! Sooooooo happy there will be more books!  Anyone that leaves a bad review because they are mad they have to wait for the next book is just rude.  Book reviews should only be about the book!  I don't understand how anyone can read this book and not love it!  She is a wonderful author and deserves better than to be treated so cruelly by petty people.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It is a very solid case. Durable and also attractive. I would recommend it to anyone wishing to protect their Kindle.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this movie, it's fantastic, I've watched it so many times I've lost count. I saw this movie when I was about 8 & even at that age I loved this film. Johnny Depp does a phenomenal job, as do all of the other actors. It's a very unique storyline & holds your attention all the way through; it has just enough emotion with the perfect amount of comedy.<br /><br />The DVD: Works great, no issues there. There are no exciting special features, but I wasn't looking for that, so I personally didn't care.<br /><br />Overall: This is a must see, it really is! The performaces alone make at least one viewing worth your while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is like tha best game ever!!!!!!! ITS SO ADICTING!!!!!! I recamend this game to EVER ONE I KNOW!! Even people i dont like!;)  BUY THIS GAME IF LOVE, LOVE, LOVE TO HAVE AMAZING FUN!!!!!!!!! :):):):):):):):::):):):):):):):):):):):)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I can truly say that the only appropriate thing to say about this book is wow. This is only this long because it needs a certain number of characters to be submitted.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This is a good album. It's by no means Megadeth's best work, but people who compare it to Risk are completely wrong. If you expect every album they put out to be Rust in Peace, I guess you'll be very disappointed. If you like a solid metal album, this is worth a listen. I really don't understand all the backlash. You'd think this was LuLu or something...
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun and rather addicting. I can't seem to get past the 490 hurdle but will continue to try. Would like to add more coins but won't until I can &#34;up&#34; my score. Seems to hang up on the same spot every time. Hope it isn't because I have to purchase more coins.Will let you know later.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First of all, I can understand why some are frustrated. If I had expected the conclusion with this book, and then found that this is not the case, I might have felt the same way. As I happens I knew before starting this book, that we get 2 more. I am not bothered by that, infact I am sooooo happy that I get to spend even more time with Eva and Gideon, because I am not ready to say goodbye just yet. I have read other reviws saying, that there are no, or a very thin plotline. Personally I have to disagree. The book takes place over a two week span, with a lot going on. Focus is on the development in Eva and Gideons relationship, and after them spending so much time apart in RIY, I enjoyed them being together, working on them as a couple. As always Sylvia Day writes an intense and VERY hot story. I was draged in and could not put it down
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and cannot wait until season 4 comes out. The characters are likable, albeit imperfect. A wonderful glimpse into a time past.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I like this season because it was captivating and the story continued throughout the entire season. &#34;Similtude&#34; was an interesting episode involving a very short lived clone of Trip. I enjoyed &#34;Carpenter Street&#34; where Archer and T'Pol travel to 2004 Detroit to stop a bio-weapon, After this season was over, I was ready for the whole time travel plot to be laid to rest for a long while. I could watch this entire season over again.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I wish it got a bit of an update. Graphics look fine and it runs well but after trying to open it back up, the app will not respond. Only way to make it work on a kindle is to restart the entire device. Idk what makes it glitch so bad but I'm sure it could be fixed.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was extremely dissatisfying. Sylvia Day has created a filler book to extend the series. Don't waste your time with reading this one. I loved #1 and #2; but after this book, I'm done with Crossfire.
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|Cannot get enough of Simon's Cat and kitten. They definitely remind me of my own cats. Catch Simon's Cat on you tube, love the music too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My child loves this gamr for his Kindle Fire. It generates lots of laughter and fun. I would recommend this to any parent for fun emtertainment.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Its predictions are good if you're like most people, and you likely are more than you think. Most of us are more predictable than we'd like to believe.<br /><br />But I just can't get over the permissions.
B0094KT68O|5.0|This movie is lovely. It gives adults and kids an hour and a half of gentle fun. Buzz is a brave hero and Jessie is spirited and childlike. And the bloopers are delightful.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I really like the bag. The handle at the top of my prior bag (same backpack) broke at the stitching. I was initially disappointed. I emailed Amazon and no questions asked they sent me this one. Hopefully stitching stays in place but the service far exceeded my expectations. Thank you, John
B005544TRQ|5.0|Ill make it simple, Suits is fun mindless TV. The show builds characters, while blending drama and humor perfectly, something USA Network is excellent at, while keeping the show fresh and slightly different.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Ms. Harris really knows how to tell a story.  Can't wait until November's epilogue book to find out what happens to everyone.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I can't talk about the book until more friends read it....
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a good book but like most people I am so disappointed that it was not what was advertised! That means \\"a Trilogy\\". I was so frustrated when I got to the end and it is a continued book past \\"three: last time I checked tri means three (3). I will finish the series but I will not buy anymore of Sylvia Day's books. It had been so long between books that I had to try to think back as to who everyone was. I passed the first two books on. (I hated the 2nd book and thought Book 3 must be something!) It was hot but I still cannot believe it is continued again!!!!
B004YEZBW0|2.0|I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital copy.  Now I was not expecting the digital copy to still be valid, but I did expect the blu-ray to have the extended version, not only the theater version.  I know there is an extended blu-ray out there, I guess I will have to hunt a bit more for the correct version.  To my knowledge only HP1 and HP2 have been released in extended versions, but finding the right blu-ray will prove to be a challenge.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a great read, complex characters and storyline.  Authors writing style flows smoothly so that the reader is enveloped into the story.  Yes, I'm recommending to friends and family.  Our book club loved it
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Story drug out....no ending to any part at all...nothing romantic at all...<br /><br />Disappointing, to say the least, and I hope other writers take notice that people are not falling for this anymore.  You will have $50 in, what is essentially, one book by the end.  I feel ripped off.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|this did not feel like a die hard movies to me<br />just isn't up to the caliber of the series
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I feel cheated. I devoured this book. It was a little awkward in places, and a little trite or unbelievable in others, but I kept thinking it was all going to come out right and redeem itself in the end.<br /><br />It didn't.<br /><br />Having just read The Fault in Our Stars, I can't help comparing the courage and understanding of the importance of human connection and preciousness of life those terminal cancer teen characters had with this disabled character. What a horribly selfish, shallow man. He started out that way and ended that way, never giving a second thought to the devastating consequences his choices had on those he professed to care about. Coward.<br /><br />I keep telling myself it's just fiction.<br /><br />Then I start thinking how all of us have crap in our lives that we didn't plan or choose. But we don't throw in the towel just because we could at least choose that. Life is too precious. And there are always other possible choices to make.<br /><br />I can understand how someone might reach a point where death provides sweet relief from the tortuous end of a fatal illness. The author did not show us that this character was at that point. She didn't even accurately portray the range and depth of the whole situation in which Will found himself.<br /><br />I realize now how aptly named the book is: \\"I'm going to think about ME and my pain BEFORE I care about YOU.\\"
1935597760|4.0|What a grand book.  Except for a very few areas of disconnect for me, the tale was told in a most exquisite way.  The characters were quite vivid.  Just the mentioning of certain names will get your heart pounding.<br /><br />The orphanage in the case was a hellhole.  If these dumping grounds for children were run this way, it is then not surprising that many children did not survive them.<br /><br />The humor was well placed, and certainly needed after some scenes.  It is a bittersweet tale for sure.<br /><br />Recommended it to our book club!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Awesome book, Charlie is such an authentic and awesome character who's admirable and relateable. His candidness is something which should be valued. Movie is good too.
0061928356|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I learned a lot about customs and differences in actions by various groups in India  I did not know that they did not keep girls babies.  I thought that was only in China.  I have started reading more about gender differences in other countries because of this book. Have given it to others to read
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's mindless in a way.  It makes time fly.  I can't count the number of hours that have gone by that I've played this game.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Literally gave me a sugar rush! I had to just strap in during the early mundane scenes, because I never saw the awesomeness that Candy Land had in store for me....... SUGAR RUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AN0KGWE|2.0|I feel ripped off. I have 20 Mbps internet and rarely throughout an episode am I watching in HD. It's so blurry at times it's not even DVD quality.  Pretty disappointed, amazon.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|Really nice game but difficult to control. I have never flown an RC before, just the real thing on a few &#34;lucky&#34; occasions. I will either quickly get the hang of it or find something else to do with what little free time I have. A very nice game though and worth a try for anyone who loves to fly!!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Really loved this CD.  As always Rod Stewart is at his best.  The older he gets the greater the songs.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Great great movie.  I did not see the end happening.  A def must watch.  A bunch of great actors in this movie.
B000U6BT40|5.0|This show is great and the actors do an awesome job. I was hooked after the first episode and haven't been able to stop watching. You should definitely watch this show.
B002NNA9N0|3.0|I decided to watch this based on all the great reviews I read.  I'm not going to lie, it was a little slow for me.  A bunch of great actors but I felt the film wasn't their best.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season three was wonderful and we enjoyed it enormously...until the last 30 seconds.  I couldn't decide if I should cry (which I did) or scream at the TV (which I also did).  Can't wait for season four to see what happens next.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Cloud Atlas was first a novel written by David Mitchell, a novel that I highly recommend. Before hearing of the novel I had watched the five-minute trailer for the film. In those five minutes emotions rushed through me that I had no control over. The whole idea of Cloud Atlas was a mystery to me, even after watching the trailer I was a bit confused but eager to find out more. I Googled it and came to find out it was a book. I read a synopsis and bought it through Amazon right away. It was a bit difficult to get through but the end result was amazing. I saw the film in theatres three times and each time I cried because I knew the little details before other people who had no idea what Cloud Atlas was. The idea of reincarnation, as others have pointed out, tends to be a foreign idea to those here in the States. In this film it is presented very beautifully and creatively, as well as in the book. There was not a thing I disliked about this film. The three hours (don't let that deter you) flew by very quickly. And even though there are differences between the novel and the film, they are each magnificent on their own. For a novel to be deemed un-filmable, this film proved it was able to be done.<br /><br />This film has impacted me more than any other film I have seen. It has made me think more spiritually and overall I just felt happy after having seen it for the first time. It was an experience I will never forget.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|The new cd is very good, better than the last one.  However I still like the first 2 cd's best.  Lady A is going more country now than I like.
B0073COMUW|5.0|I bought these lights for the master bathroom, for a vanity lighting kit installed just above a mirror. My wife loves the daylight they emit, as they allow her to put on make-up in a more realistic-natural light environment. The light they produce is clear; not yellowish like the \\"warm light\\" other LED light bulbs produce. I like the fact that they only consume 10-watts of power as compare with a similar incandescent light bulb at 60-watts...that's a big saving. They are supposed to last many years as well, but only time would tell.<br /><br />Please note that my review is for \\"daylight\\" version of this product. Although this model,the \\"warmlight\\", is similar in appearance and has the same efficiency, the light they produce is yellowish.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This was a great finish to the maze runner series and hope for a sister trilogy so I can keep reading!
B000I3SYEI|5.0|My daughter had never watched the movie. It was great to see the original. I still cry every time! Great movie!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I haven't read anything by David Baldacci for some time and I'm wondering why.  I enjoy his style of writing.  He keeps things moving and seems to have researched his topics well.  I particularly liked the young teenager Julia.  While she had a bit of a smart mouth on her at times (typical of a teen) she also had the clear unadulterated logic to spell out the heart of the situation without being obnoxious.<br />As to Will Robie, he seems to be Mr. perfect, at least for the harrowing life he leads in the pages of the book.  I don't know how long he can last under such pressure but  I have already decided to buy Mr. Baldacci's  next book &#34;The Hit&#34; so maybe I']] find out!<br /><br />as to Will Robie
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Worked as described and transferred images quickly from my Nikon SD memory to Pictures in the iPad. Even able to process images as panoramic.
193700788X|5.0|Without spoiling the book.....I knew Sookie wouldn't be turned vampire. Bill had been out of the picture for a while. To me, the inevitable happened. The book doesn't really explain everything though, so hopefully our questions get answered later on.
0984074422|5.0|Haven't gotten through the entire book yet but my initial impressions is WOW - well documented and very eye-opening.  Even my college aged daughter has been reading through this facinating book.
B00B4VXQC8|3.0|I don't know what to think about this CD.<br />It's not like the other Bonjovi CDs that i own..<br />It's different.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Season 4 definitely did not disappoint! I can't wait to start Season 5.  I wish it was currently available on Amazon Prime.
B002NF1ZI6|3.0|I don't remember ordering this item but I'll see what the kids think of them. They like building with legos
B001NLL8LA|5.0|As I said in an earlier review, I have read all of the Reacher books and thoroughly enjoyed them.  It's a nice way to take a break from the stress of work and life and just sit back and enjoy the adventures he falls into while wandering across the country.
B005OYKHSM|5.0|Great car action and decent plot. The Rock was a great addition to the cast. All in all a fun movie. Nice twist at the end after the credits.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I love the read, it keeps me turning the pages to see what comes next and occasionally it really surprises me which is always fun.  I have read all that have been written about Jack Reacher and looking forward to the next one, keep them coming Lee Child!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This was pleasant enough and I enjoyed reading it. It was not a gripping story, the ending was kind of weak.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This was the final book in a series that we loved.  The first book, Delirium, drew us into it's distopian world.  Requiem finishes off the series nicely.  We weren't quite satisfied with the end but it's hard to finish off a good series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game overall :) definitely 5 stars! Have to earn a lot of stuff though... get if you have time to play :D
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome read leaves you hungry for what is yet to come. Very captivating. I am ready for the next installment.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I like mahjong games. This one is a lot of fun. I would recommend it to all my friends. Glad I found it.
0316227706|5.0|This was a christmas present for my niece.  This is a fun book and great gift for all age groups.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this.version of Spider Solitaire.  It is better than the one I play on my computer.  I especially like being able to tap a card and having it automatically go to where it needs to.
B009NY43NY|4.0|The book is a good read.  I was a little disappointed how some of the story lines  wrapped up for some of the main characters.
B0014BECF8|5.0|Being a long-time George Michael fan I was not disappointed with this CD.  It arrived quickly and I have enjoyed the collection of music on this disc.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Yeah this little sharpener is pretty awesome.  It's smaller than a lighter but it will sharpen dull blades with the carbides.  The ceramics keep sharp blades sharper.  And the rod will take care of your serrated edges.  Nice tool for cheap, highly recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely CANNOT wait for the next book in The Crossfire series. I could and would read 20 of them. Though I can't get enough of Gideon and Eva, it's going to kill me waiting!! Awesome job Sylvia, Please don't make me wait long!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The amazing changes with these two are phenomenal!! I love how they have both grown and their relationship is so different (good way). I also about had a few heart attacks at some of the bombs dropped!!!
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Overall this was a really good book. An actual whodunit vs we know who it is halfway through and the rest of the book is Harry trying to prove \\"his gut\\"right.<br /><br />With the backdrop of a city on the verge of renewed rioting over one of the murders, Harry's team must solve this fast....but someone is working to sabotage them....Will the city go up in flames because of it?<br /><br />Worse still, Bosch has been pulled into the political arena and media spotlight where words are twisted, backstabbing's the norm.<br /><br />He can't trust ANYONE on his huge task force, except his two partners Rider and Edger.....time is ticking.<br /><br />Check, I couldn't put this book down and normally, I've figured SOMETHING IF NOT WHO, BUT I WAS WAAAAAAY OFF BASE HERE.<br /><br />This is a fast-paced, well done book I would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway sitters is a pretty good game. It's challenging during some parts. I love the different places you have avaliable during the world tour. But, during the process of speeding up the game has some serious lag
B002JVWR9U|5.0|WATCHING THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON OVER AGAIN MADE ME REMEBER WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS TELEVISION SERIES. BRAVO
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|This is 40 was a great movie, its pretty true to life and its hysterical.  I've watched to twice and that says a lot because once I've seen a movie i never watch it more than once.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is full of twists and turns and that makes it great.  I am not sure what I wanted for am ending but that wasn't it. Over all a great read.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie is so freaking cute and funny. Action, comedy, and romance! ALL IN ONE. The best. I watched this at the theater more then one time, i loved it. I even order the book! The book is great too. Lots of cursing, but it was the best. Thanks.
0679600701|5.0|I bought this book for a present and it has been a great pleasure to see that the reader is totally engrossed in the works and discoveries of Charles Darwin.  As the reader has always been interested in evolution, this book has added to his library of books of Albert Einstein, Richard Dawkins and many other seekers of life's mysteries. Thanking you
B00947N6D8|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!! It was worth it!! I watched this at the movie theater more then one time, and i really enjoyed it. I'm also really happy that the movie came out! I shared this with my friends and they loved it! Thanks.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Bradley Cooper is amazing in this movie.  His depiction of bipolar disorder is fantastic and disturbing.  He takes you with him on this journey and it's not an easy ride.  Loved the realistic discussion re: meds etc.  As a mental health professional, great to see someone did their homework.<br /><br />All of this and a sweet ending.  Couldn't ask for more.  Oh and loved Robert De Niro as the loving father struggling to understand.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is such a Patriot! His stories differ so dramatically from what the News Media had told us about the War in Iraq!<br />The lethal cans of gas they found that were meant to kill masses of people opened our eyes! It's told in such exciting form, you don't want to take a break from reading! What a horrible shame that such a talented man, who only killed the bad guys to save the lives of our men, was killed! And at a shooting range of all places! This book should be read by every American!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story is so full of raw passion and honest LOVE that it takes your breath away.  I really, really hope we loyal readers don't have to wait another year for the next book!!!
B006GKHE6G|3.0|it is ok which it had more stunts but I like it helps me get the stress out after a long day at work.
B0087GYY92|4.0|A fantastic book- this is what sci-fi should be. Interesting, thought-provoking, and a great story. It's sci-fi like &#34;the life of pi&#34; is fantasy.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I haven't done anything with it yet but will be since I have an Avon business and it will help to see some of my documents.
B002NNA9N0|2.0|While I do think this was well acted and full of a great cast, the story line was depressing. Plus there was a lot of cussing - throughout the entire movie.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed!! I can't believe I wasted money on this book! The ending sucked and the book wasn't at all what I expected!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game you can ever get you should really GET IT you can't ever beat it it's impossible it's impossible
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game and j think u guys should do next subway sitters in washition DC love ya :D
030746363X|1.0|My co-worker lost a lot of weight really fast but gained it all back and more doing the low carb thing.<br /><br />I think the writer is a scam artist.  This book was hyped up too much.  Yes, there are some good ideas in the book.  Yes, there are some lies in the book like gaining 30 pounds of muscle in a month.
0439023513|4.0|Awesome. I cant believe what happens. My book came in perfect condition. And so cheap it was pretty amazing. After im done i let my friends and family borrow the book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Love this entire series and this book was just as awesome.  However, I don't like who Sookie ends up as a lover at the end (boo).  But that's just a personal opinion.  If you've read the rest you have to finish off the series!
0385349947|4.0|I plan to give it to my daughter for her reading and for our discussion since I was a part of the first women in business movement years ago.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|So glad they brought Doctor Who back to us ! I was a fan in the late 70's and early eighties (high School years)<br />Very cool !!!
B007YTJG3W|5.0|A true story about the modern warfare, that book tell us a real firefight combat with a rich details and amazing realism.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|Hey if the Rolling Stones can keep it going why not Led Zeppelin ????<br />It was very cool to finally see this show.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have loved this whole series of books, but i think i like The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest best.  I love learning about another country and enjoy getting caught up in the lives of interesting people.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I bought this cd not knowing much about Mumford and Sons thinking that I'd like a couple of songs to put on a playlist. After listening to this cd I am a total fan. I can listen to the album all the entire way through without skipping tracks.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Go story, easy read, interesting ending. Works very well with the previous book and makes you look forward to the next Reacher novel.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|there are so many varieties to choose from.  i really love the rain sounds.  they help me fall asleep faster and i wake up feeling refreshed.
125000098X|2.0|Very disappointing.  Having read the first two books of this trilogy I was looking forward to the conclusion of the Clifton Chronicles.  Instead I got the impression that the author was bored with the subject and just wanted to rush to the ending.  Many questions were left unanswered leaving me with the awful feeling that Jeffrey Archer was planning to dupe his readers again with yet another edition of the Clifton Chronicles.  I'll take a pass on that one.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|It works excellent on my nikon 1 V1.  I could adapt a 55 - 300 mm lense. It is very easy to use.
006117758X|5.0|Charles Bukowski's \\"Ham on Rye\\" is bleak, violent, obscene, occasionally funny--and brilliant.  It's a novel about the worst of human nature, and coping with it.<br /><br />I first encountered Bukowski as a poet, and found his work earthy and sexual, but not erotic; his verse, although refreshingly honest and direct, displays misogynistic tendencies and an existentialist attitude.  \\"Ham on Rye,\\" an apparently semi-autobiographical work, helps explain whence that anger and disorientation derives.<br /><br />The story spans the childhood, adolescence, and the onset of young adulthood of Henry Chinaski, the only son of destitute parents eking their way through the Great Depression in Los Angeles.  Henry is constantly abused physically and emotionally by his father, and his mother is pusillanimous, completely unable and unwilling to stand up against her husband and for her son.  He grows up sullen and anti-social, his only friends, such as they are, social outcasts who out of their own loneliness foist themselves upon him.<br /><br />As Henry gets older, larger and stronger, he finds solace in his toughness; his father's beatings come to an end when he's able to tolerate them with little pain.  Then, in adolescence, a new form of torture arrives, resembling some biblical plague in the form of boils that cover his entire body.  He feels revulsion towards himself, and an anger against his privileged peers and women in general that masks his fear of rejection; his saturnine disposition ensures that people treat him poorly.  Henry, like Holden Caulfield, regards the world as false and worthless.<br /><br />By the time he (barely) graduates from high school, Henry is an alcoholic, and is given to brutal fighting.  As Hitler rises in Germany, Henry, who was born in Germany, pretends to adopt fascism to annoy others.  He vacillates between isolation and destructiveness: \\"I felt as if I were destined to be a murderer, a bank robber, a saint, a rapist, a monk, a hermit.  ...The life of the sane, average man was dull worse than death\\" (p. 307).  And yet, amid all the gloom one small shaft of light appears: Henry realizes that he likes to write.<br /><br />Bukowski's style is direct and frank.  In the initial pages, when Henry is but a toddler, the  sentences are short and simple: \\"It was a table, I saw a table leg, I saw the legs of the people, and a portion of the tablecloth hanging down.  It was dark under there, I like being under there\\" (p. 1).  Not long after these initial pages, the dominant form of writing becomes dialogue.  The speech sounds authentic; it's cruel and obscene.  In the course of his young life, Henry seems to witness all of the crappy things people can do to one another.<br /><br />As world events begin to intrude in Henry's world, one may not really give much thought to it, but the insular world that Henry lives in is, in its violence, crassness, and lack of any decency, exactly what's going on \\"out there.\\"  One might want to hold on to some shred of hope, some sense that all is not as bad as it seems, and then one faces Pearl Harbor, one soon encounters the genocide of Nazi Germany.<br /><br />We might not like what we see when we read \\"Ham on Rye,\\" but that's just the point.  The world can be a cold and horrible place.  If we are driven to seek solace and peace, as we must, we must first acknowledge all the pain and the suffering.life of the sane, average man was dull worse than death\\" (p. 307).

B00BEXB18M|4.0|Like most bands that have long careers, Megadeth music has gone through phases, or eras.  Classic-era Megadeth put out 4 heavy, thrashy albums from Killing is my Business ('85) through Rust in Peace ('90), followed by a transitional album in Countdown to Extinction ('92).  Then, from Youthanasia ('94) through the temporary disbanding of the band following The World Needs a Hero ('01), Megadeth albums featured pop-oriented mid-tempo hard rock and \\"classic metal\\" songs broken up by the occasional thrashier track.  Personally, I loved both eras.  I listen to a wide variety of rock music that ranges from Thrash Metal to Prog to Grunge to hair metal to modern indie rock, and just about everything in between.  In other words, I'm not exclusively a metalhead -- I like both heavy and lighter music, depending on what I'm in the mood for at any given moment.<br /><br />As far as modern Megadeth albums go, Dave put out albums that got heavier and heavier from The System Has Failed ('04) to Endgame ('09).  Then, Dave Ellefson re-joined the band and we got a transitional album of sorts in Thirteen ('11), that sounded like more of a mix between their heavier '80s & '00s stuff and their lighter '90s stuff.  Super Collider, as I expected (and predicted after hearing Thirteen), falls into that \\"Youthanasia/Hidden Treasures/Cryptic Writings/Risk/World Needs a Hero\\" mold of mid-tempo Megadeth albums.  It has a few thrashier songs, most notably the opener (Kingmaker), but the majority of the album is noteceably tamer than even Thirteen was.  There is no \\"This Day We Fight!\\" or \\"Washington is Next!\\" on Super Collider.  However, the album does contain tracks that remind me a lot of past Megadeth songs like \\"Almost Honest\\", \\"Breadline\\", and (more recently) \\"The Hardest Part of Letting Go.\\"  Different, but still welcome.<br /><br />Yes, it would have been nice if this album had turned out to be another Endgame or RIP, but I don't mind another dose of Cryptic Writings, Hidden Treasures, oreven (gasp!) Risk at all.  I think it's yet another solid effort, and I don't mind the change of pace.  Much like modern-day Iron Maiden, modern-day Megadeth has continued to please my ears with each new release this millenium.  It's nice to have old bands from my youth still alive and well and putting out quality music.  Although after a few listens, Super Collider is probably my least favorite of the modern (2004-present) Megadeth albums, I'd still recommend it to people like me who enjoy the entire Megadeth catalogue.  Hopefully this isn't the last new album we'll get from the Daves & Co.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I've tried these AI types of programs before and always stumped them. So I gave this one a go. I stumped it on the first time, first round<br /> But it asked me if I wanted to continue and I agreed. So it continued to ask real specific questions about the character. After nearly another round of questions it guesses right. Ward Bond from Wagon Train. Lol I was a little happy I stumped it but annoyed and happy at the same time that it got it the second round. Fun!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|When I got this I thought that it would just be an alarm clock but it did a whole lot more than I expected and I recommend this app to any one who needs to get up early believe me it is the best alarm clock ever!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Bad story line though out. But, maybe, I have missed something.... I'd like to think I have or it's too bad.
B0014BY72Q|3.0|The story is still great, the film technology is old, but I remember 1st viewing this movie at a drive in movie theater in 1976(?), it was state of the art back then.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Classic Star Trek. Great show and still watchable! Kirk, Spock, Scotty and the great Sulu travel through space fighting bad guys and push social boundaries.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It had its funny moments.  Kind of slow at times.  Lighthearted enough.  You could do a lot better and far worse.
B000LX00RY|5.0|Meryl Streep is a great actress, and is excellent in this movie!  She reminds me of some people I knew in real life in this movie lol!
B004UID2LC|4.0|Like this for my kindle its fast and easy to use but needs a shuffle function for playlists.  Aside from that its great!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This movie is awesome!  I love the six stores in parallel.  Each one is connected to the others, and every time you watch it, you will notice something new.  Plus I think it's really cool how the same actors (and actresses) played different roles and look amazingly different in each.  Comes with Blu-Ray and Regular DVDs.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|easy to learn playing on kindle some times have issues with single target spells but fun game. thanks for the hours of wasted time.
0201633612|5.0|This book is a great reference to have when facing design challenges.  I've used quite a few patterns from it.  It also provides a nice basis for some of the more modern books such as Alexandrescu's Modern C++ Design.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love period pieces, and this British early 1900s show gets better every episode. Personally I love the Mary and Matthew relationship, Maggie Smith as the grandmother is brilliant, and the ever dramatic servants always have wonderful story lines. I would recommend this show to anyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard from many people that they really loved Downton Abbey. Since I had already missed so much I didn't want to start in the middle. But when I had an offer to try Amazon Prime I decided to try it. I then found out that I could watch it from the beginning as part of the amazon prime streaming. I was totally hooked. I think I watched the whole season in 1 week! I love the combination of a story that also integrates history into it. And then watched the 2nd season in about a week too!! Can't wait for season 3.
B001BANK32|5.0|Loved it! Very interesting and well written. I don't usually enjoy horror but I loved this book from start to finish.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|We cant wait to get more Lego movies, they are really cute and great for all ages but our 4 year old just loves them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using this app for over a year and I love it!  I love the reading plans and that I can so easily change Bible versions.  I'm not even tempted to try a different Bible app.  This one does great for me.
0670026638|5.0|This book was the best I've read in a long time. It is lively without being superficial and philosophical without being erudite. A lovely book that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a heartrendingly beautiful read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved  the MYST games and this is very reminiscent of those. This is a cerebral, problem-solving-type game. I agree with the other reviews that the game is too short and I wanted it to go on and on, too. But, maybe part of that is because it's so hard to put down, especially once a new inventory piece is discovered. Just five more minutes, okay just five more and then I'll go do something productive. Mmm-hmm. An hour later. . . If you enjoyed MYST, you'll really be glad you got this game.  All the reviews that say YOU WANT THIS GAME are right! Hey, Fireproof Games, where's the sequel? We're all waiting . . .
B003O86FMW|4.0|For an easy read book I thought it was well done. I thought it was much more interesting than the first.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved the puzzles in this game. Stumped me a few times but others it was obvious. I loved to see what would happen next. These types of games intrigue me so I'm excited for the next one. Keep them coming but please make it so I don't beat in under two hours.
B00AGDW8II|4.0|I watch this film every few years. It is fun to watch Debra Winger, the detective, tracking and interacting with the Black Widow.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Very intriguing, interesting cases, like the X Files with believable characters and science based terror. You will not find the tight shirts and high heels of CSI genre TV shows. Glamor is not the priority here.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|If I could give this movie half a star, or zero, I would .... what a snore-fest trying to be a big sweeping epic story spanning lifespans blah blah blah. way too long in the tooth too. total suck. ranks up there with &#34;thin red line&#34; and all those other horrific movies by &#34;the brilliant&#34; Terrence Malik. I get it, we all have different tastes, but Cloud Atlas was just one big giant piece of crap. period.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|Jeffery archer is the best storyteller I have ever read ( and I read a lot) and this is one of his big two.  I highly recommend for the reader who likes a component of fact but enjoys the story that can be woven in fiction
006114665X|5.0|Given the complexity of the situation in 1914, any author writing about the nations, facts and emotions involved faces an enormous challenge.  Thirty-odd years ago,there were, according to author Christopher Clark, as many as 25,000 books of on the subject.  The fulsome and oft-time politically-driven official government accounts and archives are the Everest of historical scholarship.  The author wisely has decided to ask and answer the question: HOW the war began. How the leaders and other players behaved.  He does not ask WHY; he assigns no guilt: that, gentle reader, is for you to fathom.  With elegance and ease, Clark tacks the boat of explanation in and out of the various harbors of data.  His written voice is one that engages, inspires trust and spurs curiosity.  A book about a wildly confusing situation is as clear as a mountain lake. In short: this is a well-organized book laden with treasures. Hats off the Clark.  DO BUY AND READ THIS BOOK.
B003DT194G|5.0|Is a wonderful piece of the world movie history. Great actors, music and director. Thank you Sergio Leone and Enio Morricone.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Cute movie.  I loved all the references to old games.  A fun watch.  I'm a fan of animated/computer graphics so I'm biased but I would recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game for all horse lovers. The graphics are stunning and so are all the horses to choose from. You will not waist your time on this game. It's super fun!!!
B001MKQS4O|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman delivers an amazing performance as Capote.  I don't know what Capote was like in real life but even if his impression of him was off, he's still powerful in this movie.  Worth a watch, on a very depressing, gloomy, rainy day.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Good story line with a few unexpected twists..  Type of book that could spin off a few more books about the characters in this book.
B00932A4XE|2.0|Not my favorite, I expected more, I guess, from such an A-List comedy cast. You might like it if giving birth is your thing
0425263924|3.0|I really loved these books until this one. I liked the book overall. I do wish there was not so much added drama. Way too much drama! It just complicated the story and almost made it hard to keep up with. For me it ended well with G & E but the story told little of them this time. There was too much focus on the other characters. Not sure how 2 more books could come out of this story. I'm curious to see but won't be counting down the days next time. If your questioning getting it. I'd say go ahead. You may be disappointed but I think the overall outcome it good given the story this time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great alarm clock!  Works &amp; its free. Cant beat that :) It goes off even in sleep mode. Can chose any music or tones of your choice.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Well....there was a lot of fluff in this book that I could have done without. I wanted an answer on something and got nothing. When something is billed as a trilogy, it should BE a trilogy. The fact that I paid $30 for this series is enough for me. Now it's going to be a 5 part series? Come on Sylvia...some of us just want a happy ending. Nothing changed, the characters continued to  be themselves and really didn't come to any new conclusions. This book was about the stuff that one normally doesn't read...the in between stuff.  Highly disappointed. Will we have to wait 2 years for the next book? By then, I'll have forgotten this trilogy even exists and I certainly won't read the first 3 again to refresh my memory.
0307744434|5.0|This book had me hooked right from the start! What an entertaining storyline! Full of whimsy and surprises... A love story too! Highly recommend!!!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I liked the movie; loved it in 3D. It immerses you with the shots of the realms. Glad I upgraded to this version.
B004MPRWJG|5.0|So as I am sure any reader will tell you that the book to most any movie is sooooo much better and this is once again true for this book.  I bought this book for my mom and she can not put it down.... It takes you on a journey that you are soon not to forget!
B00B8PRDHE|4.0|While I am not always crazy about Ringo's tunes, the musicianship of the band over comes it.  This is an amazing group of musicians that play well off of each other.  Fantastic!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I did not know about the round-up of the Jewish people in France during the war.  At times it was hard to continue reading not really wanting to know about this horrible time in history but it was one of the best books I have ever read.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book seemed to drag on for me.  I was dissappointed with Eric & Sookies break-up.  I expected a little bit more from two people who supposedly love each other.  I was also let down with how things progressed with Sam & Sookie.<br /><br />I'm glad the series is over.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|A good story and good sequel with lots of fun characters and twists, but sometimes I could predict accurately what was gonna happen way before it happened.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love The Good Wife.  The character development is great, the supporting cast is fascinating and the individual episode plots are great.  This season got even more interesting as Alicia gained confidence in herself aside from her roles as wife and mother.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't wait for this to come out and I finished it in a day, I couldn't put it down!! Loved it!!!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was a little disappointed in the Eric and Sookie split.  Just seems like so much time was invested and now it seems to be done with.<br /><br />I always enjoy these books but do hope for a bit more in the next one.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|\\"Gideon was a force of nature, his magnetic self-possession so powerful it put everyone around him in his shadow. I saw flashes of it every day and was awed by it, but not nearly as much as I was by the charming, wryly amusing lover I had entirely to myself in our private moments together.\\"<br /><br />The Crossfire saga is as good as it gets as far as whirlwind romance, all-consuming story line and captivating and unforgettable characters.<br /><br />Best experienced, The Crossfire series is Gideon's and Eva's epic love story, both broken, flawed and co-dependent and yet so determined and relentless for their elusive happily-ever after.  Follow them through sky-high ups and rock-bottom lows as their relationship is tested with demons from their pasts, envy, jealousy, secrets and lies.  Yet their biggest obstacles will always come from within.  It's a journey or self discovery and fulfillment and about pushing all limits and surrendering it all for love.<br /><br />Books must be read in order:<br />Bared to you (Book 1)<br />Reflected in you (book 2)<br />Entwined with you (book 3)<br />Untitled (book 4)<br />Untitled (book 5)<br /><br />For me the theme song for Gideon's and Eva's story: Otis Redding's soulful rendition of \\"My precious love\\".  The lyrics so simply depicts the intensity of Gideon's love and need for his Eva.<br /><br />Hero: Gideon G. Cross/28 years/Founder-Ceo of Cross Industries/Black hair/blue eyes/$$$$ (New worth $11 BIL.)/Forbes #25<br />Heroine: Eva L. Tramell/24 years/Ad agency assistant-recent College graduate/Bland hair/gray eyes/$$$<br /><br />Gideon Cross is my ultimate hero. His combination of larger-than life personality and uncanny good looks; enigmatic and elusive; intense and in-control; broken and flawed; ruthless and unyielding, yet when it came to his Eva vulnerable, relentless and human.<br /><br />\\"Honestly, Gideon Cross had been designed to f~  k a woman right out of her mind.\\"<br /><br />Six words to describe Gideon: Unforgettable, intense, ruthless, enigmatic, dominant and captivating.<br /><br />Like it or not, but Eva Tramell is everything Gideon needed.  Five words to describe Eva: Endearing, needy, tenacious, smart and fragile.<br /><br />\\"Reminds me of the red dress you wore the first time I had you. That was it for me, you know. You devastated me. There was no coming back from that.\\"<br /><br />Entwined with you (book 3), just like book 1 and 2, is very much a rollercoaster;  Suspensefully told it's filled with villains, surprises and shockers, but also beautifully depicting an against-all-odds love and of course in true Sylvia Day fashion plenty of sinfully steamy sex scenes.  I like the direction she took in book 3.  Ms. Day is a master at spinning a story and she has succeeded with artfully tying in events from previous books without making it feel like a synopsis. Though it did not end with the cliff-hanger of all cliff-hangers it had an abrupt ending.  But had I known beforehand I would still have read it! And considering everything that has happened it makes sense to have another two books to wrap it all up.<br /><br />Epic!  Spellbinding! Captivating! Addictive! Unforgettable!  In my humble opinion likely to become one of the best love stories of all times! Thanks Ms. Day!<br /><br />\\"Gideon was a man who'd lived an entirely solitary life, and yet he'd accepted me into it so completely that he could envision a future I was afraid to imagine. I was so scared I'd only be setting myself up for a heartbreak I couldn't survive.\\"<br />***<br />Hero rating: 5+++ stars<br />Heroine rating: 5 stars<br />Sex scenes rating: 5+ stars<br />Sex scenes frequency: 5 stars<br />Storyline concept rating: 5 stars<br />Storytelling skills rating: 5 stars<br />Story ending rating: N/A<br />Book editing rating (5 = no edits spotted): 5 stars<br />***************************************<br />Overall rating: 5+ stars<br /><br />Would I recommend this series: Yes.<br />Would I re-read this series: Yes.<br />Would I read future books by this author: Yes.es.<br />Would I read future books by this author: Yes.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I needed a scanner for a long time, and this 'free app pf the day' came along. Works perfectly! I especially like the ability to combine scans into one PDF...thank you!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I thought that it would be sumb, but watched with my wife anyway.  Loved it!  Recommend to all husbands to watch with wife or sig other.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|it is a super fun game the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I beat it inside of 2 hours.
B005HSL626|2.0|Ever since the newest update, (the one with starfruit and stuff) it has been making every other app lag and even close themselves! I really like this app, but now I can't play it because it conflicts with my other apps (or something like that) please fix!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the best game for all ages super fun. I love how it changes themes.
193700788X|2.0|Poor writing, the ending was terrible, very all over the place. If you loved the previous books, DO NOT read this one
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|After falling madly in love with \\"One Minute More\\" off the Heroes Fall \\"soundtrack,\\" I became strangely enthralled with this group. They will be big; I'm fairly certain. This electro-pop is upbeat and makes you want to move. They have free mp3 downloads on their website if you want to sample more prior to buying. I just burned a CD of this and the four other songs I could get my hands on.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest !! I can actually hours, and days on Pinterest.  I have fallen asleep with my kindle in bed on Pinterest. LOL!
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|The chemistry between father and daughter was sometimes contrived and she her actions didn't always seem consistent with the storyline without more back story.  At times the action seems to border close on unbelievable making it difficult suspend one's belief, and small logical errors (not making use of medical supplies).  Not the most relationally deep nor best effective editing involved here.<br /><br />There are some good plot twists, a more layered good guy-bad guy distinction, and good fights that seem authentic in their presentation, along with eventually a musical track that beings to have its own originality, not Bourne Identity-derived.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Roy Huff tells a story that is both fresh and as old as time, with Everville: The First Pillar. While the work may be a little rough around the edges, this story of good versus evil kept my interest from beginning to end and I could not wait to see what would happen next. Each character is brought to life without over describing them. I was fascinated by this first book in the series, and hope to read more soon.
0811870987|5.0|This is a beautiful coffee table book. The photos are incredible.  It is a large heavy book however so more an &#34;adult&#34; book than for children.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalina Singh continues to impress.  Well written and a thoughtful conclusion to the psynet arch of this series.  The story kept me interested from start to finish, although it was predictable in sections.  Many open threads from previous stories were tied up, while leaving room for more stories in the series.
0735619670|5.0|I liked this book.  It included enough ideas for it to be worth it for me.  I think it is a good purchase
B004XQO90O|4.0|Its like Final Destination but  with twists, intelligence, excitement and a fabulous surprise ending. Its hard to fault and I usually can. Brilliant throughout.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|It has its funny parts, but overall I can't say I would ever consider watching it again, and that's a test for me. Funny once!
B00COHAUD4|3.0|This movie is just a \\"cheap thrills\\" type of horror movie. The director relies on shadows and loud blasts of music to scare you. It works a few times but I found myself holding onto the remote to lower the volume each time we are supposed to be scared. And believe me, the music blast will be at least 3x the volume of the talking. It helps to watch this movie late at night since the sets are so dark anyway. The ending was disappointing and made no sense.
B001AXME2S|5.0|I love shinedown. This album is awesome. It has great songs and at a very reasonable price. iTunes has it for more.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I kept looking for a good movie but did not find it until the last 15 minutes or so. First of all I was unable to accept the fact that an Australian was the Mayor of New York City. And second, why did the Police Commissioner look like a conehead? I enjoyed other similar movies much better, like \\"City Hall\\". You can pass on this one and watch Al Pacino instead.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Why don't all great shows do this?  I could think of some epic shows that could use this kind of treatment.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I don't know why they call this game Mahjong.  Don't waste your time.  There are many other more worthwhile games to explore.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|The former governor is getting old and this movie shows it.  It was pretty good with some decent driving sequences and good special effects.  I had originally thought to give it 3 stars.  The extra one is for all the funnies throughout the movie.  Good flick.
B005M5PER2|5.0|I love this show..... I wish they would show a little bit of the other island's in episodes. However, it does make me miss home every time I watch an episode.......
B008JJM88Q|1.0|This program crashes alot. It is not worth the time it takes to download. Even if the price of this program is free it still would be a huge waste of time to download it. Fix all the crashes &amp; errors this program produces.
0307730697|5.0|As a Marine, I found this book to be very similar to other stories in which the warrior-protagonist makes the ultimate sacrifice. There are so many of these types of stories available.<br /><br />The key deference in \\"Fearless\\" and other similar stories is in the expression of Adams' faith.<br /><br />This is an excellent and encouraging read. I feel like it is more than just the story of deployments, training and sacrifice. It is a narrative of a warrior's family and determination founded on faith, love and grace.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Interesting plot.  Acting was good.  Movie would be a good choice for older children, but the content I'd consider marginal for younger ones.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Can't believe I hadn't seen this mini series before. It is a beautiful story with superb acting. The backdrop of the industrial revolution (here specifically the cotton factories) in a Northern town juxtaposing the quiet agrarian life of the South, sets an interesting tone for the entire show.  Would highly recommend!
0761169253|5.0|Really creative book in its style, layout, message... this author is really thinking fresh.. have given a number of these books away.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was one of the best family movies made in a long time. The characters are awesome and for younger children some can understand and learn from the characters. Great family night movie or just a great movie for those people who are a child at heart!!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Game is truly epic, makes you feel as if you're almost in the game, defending your realm.  Love the quality of the graphics and the characters in it.  FUN and addicting!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I downloaded this this app for my 2 1/2 yr old grandson, he loves it! It is even teaching him how to write the alphabets on paper.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|After waiting with abated breath for this book I must say I was thoroughly disappointed. I loved the first two and have read both twice or thrice. This one paled in comparison & the fact that it's been stretched into yet another book has taken away the joy I felt when it was delivered to my kindle. The sex scenes are overdone to the point of being unrealistic which takes half the fun out of the whole story. I suffered withdrawal symptoms after the 2nd book. I'm not even looking forward to the fourth. You can do better than this Sylvia Day.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|this show is amazing, not even necessarily because of the plot, but because of how phenomenal tatiana maslany is. she makes it worth watching.
1582701903|5.0|If you want in on the secrets responsible for creating some of the worlds best producers--from Dale Carnegie, to Napoleon Hill, to Jack Canfield and Victor Hansen--then get and study this book.  The power is within you.  All you need do is to find that all-encompassing 'Master Key' to unlocking it.
0425263924|1.0|I've followed this series after reading 50 shades and I counted the days until I could revisit Eva and Gideon. But this was a DISAPPOINTMENT TO SAY THE LEAST. Now I hear its a 5 book series, COME ON Sylvia you're killing me here. Spoiler alert >>>>>> nothing happens but a wedding!! That's all I got!!!  Maybe this is where my days of Eva and Gideon come to an end. I'm not waiting another 6 months for a pointless plot.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining even if you don't want to spend real money. I play for free and still enjoy it. I really like the co-op arenas too.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Useless. Not worth the effort to download it. What's the point, actually? I have no use for a program whose only purpose is to fool someone into thinking something that isn't true. Juvenile.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun little game that is very addictive.  The game was free which is always a plus.  Real money can be used, if desired, but is not necessary.  Subway Surfers can be played by young and old.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Nicely done. Useful.The interface is clean and easy to use. It could probably use a few more features, but I'm not sure what. Does everything I wanted it to do, and does it well.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Enjoying read but not as much as Percy books. I didn't care for the different characters perspectives changing by chapter. It forced the story on who was telling it.
B00AZLBIAA|1.0|Not worth the effort to download it. What's the point, actually? I have no use for a program whose only purpose is to fool someone into thinking something that isn't true. Juvenile.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved it but I hate when he leaves you hanging until the next book.  He writes so well.  I have read all of his books.
0679805273|5.0|I've gotten this for all graduates I know. It's cute and carries a special message for those moving onto big things in their life.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Spent an hour with it. Good graphics. Smooth play. Try it. Its better.than most i have tried. Best of luck
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It's all filler sex, no solid plot and a waste of time and money.  The characters are so one dimensional and lack intimacy and chemistry.  The series never started strong in my opinion and has always had a superficial, unemotional tone but it has deteriorated with each installment.  No way should it exceed beyond three books.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I get so tired of buying CD's with only one or two good songs. this one i a refreshing change. Very good music and lyrics throughout the entire CD.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is so cool that u can communicate with your friends and sometimes your parents but they need to take kik team off
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Got this from the amazon appstore free daily app.<br /><br />Pretty fun, lots of flashing lights and nice effects. Reminds me of the classic versions of this game that I played as a child. Can also get tiring since there is no break between levels.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I love the characters and the story. The book of course was better but they did a good job with the movie. I hate that they changed the ending.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|This movie was so boring! Fell asleep within 20 minutes. Save your money and time.  Was expecting so much more from Sean Penn.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|it was a gift for someone that loves this series.  she loved it.  great value for the money.  would purchase again
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Very immature.  Not even slapstick.  A waste of 106 minutes.  If you saw the previews you saw all the funniest stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is way better than temple run and angry than run.I recommend it.<br /><br />Best game ever.works well on kindle fire HD.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read this book prior to giving it to my 13 year old &#34;Little Sister&#34;.  This is a must read for all ages.  The things you say matter - even when you don't think they do.  A definite lesson for teenagers who often speak harshly and intend their words as weapons.
B006LXQID8|5.0|I love this movie. I am also able to sync on any of my apple products and watch when there is no Internet connection
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome I love star my horse get this app it's so awesome love it u guys are awesome if u get the app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is so fun and awesome. you have to try it.try it try it TRY IT
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love so many songs on this album, though I admit I bought it first and foremost for the Charlie Brown theme--check the video out online, it's so cute.  I love their sense of humor, see the video that accompanies &#34;Me and My Cello &#34; which is a take on the song &#34;So Happy Together&#34;, to fully get it.  I like their first album too and love how they weave classical in and around the songs, even riffing off it, like on PachelBel's Canon.  The video to that one is funny too (You Tube).  I just enjoy such a positive album though their version of &#34;Nearer My God To Thee&#34; on this album is so poignant...and yes, it does remind me of the movie Titanic!
0553296981|4.0|Many friends of mine were talking about this book, so I decided to read it. I really like it, it is very interesting and it keeps you want ro read more and more. I'm not a reading person but this book, is really good!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I got so worried when I kept seeing that this book was only getting 1 star reviews.  It is so not a 1 star book!  Sylvia has given us more insight into Gideon and Eva's relationship.  We are learning more about the people who surround them and how that affects them.  I was not pleased about the cost of the Ebook but that is on the publisher!  If Sylvia Day was one of your favorite authors you would have known for awhile that the series had gone from 3 to 5 books!  I don't see what the big deal is about that----we get more Gideon and Eva.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Did not see the movie but I like the book. The characters were so interesting and charming at the same time
B006LSZECO|1.0|it is well written and I would give it one star for that. but everything else about this book makes me want to puke!  it is a horrible story. and the characters: a psychotic woman and her selfish,self-centered, husband who has no consideration for anybody besides himself; a clueless wimp sister; incompetent police officers; inlaw parents from hell; friends, neighbors, girlfriends, ex-boy/girl friends.  there is not one even remotely likeable person in the whole bunch! not one!  I cant believe there is not one decent person in the whole state of Missouri but the author didn't find any of them if there are. she tops it off with a totally unsatisfactory ending.  there are lots of books I have read that I wished would never end.  this one didn't end soon enough.
B00CISAPJS|5.0|I loved this original concept of the story. Of course some elements remained the same, but I enjoyed the in depth mythology. I've seen it twice and plan to buy the movie. A great family flick.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show.  The dynamics keep you are your toes!  Witty writing, funny, and a bit of intrigue and apprehension thrown in!  Put this on your list for &#34;must watch.&#34;<br /><br />Karla Oliverio
B009WJ14FA|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this album! Vintage Trouble is gritty, smooth, bluesy and rockin' all at once. Saw them at Bottle Rock and thought they were among the best acts there, now I can't get enough of them.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My girls loved this movie.  We emjoyed it on movie night and the girls watched it over and over the next morning.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|this is a very moving story about the insurance company. Great story. Great sub-story as well. I recomend this movie to any one who love a good drama.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|My husband loved this action movie.  We have all the collection on VHS and know we are getting it on DVD.
B004RKXN44|5.0|I really realy loved this book.  Great character development, lots going on.  Each couple has their own set of problems.  It is a fun read.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Ted is a great movie.  We enjoyed the teddy bear and his crazy things that he did.  I was a good movie to watch on Friday night
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Do I love this show? Oh, yes! It's creepy, suspensful, it doesn't have that B-movie feel, and the writer's have kept my interest in the trials and tribulations of the characters.<br /><br />And there is a storyline. If you are looking for nothing but non-stop gore and zombie stomping then play a video game!<br /><br />I was stoked that Amazon was offering the 3rd season before the normal DVD release date. I don't have cable so I figured I had to wait until August to find out what Rick and the gang had been up to. But, much to my surprise it was available through instant! I gush Amazon...just another reason to love them! Thank you for offering this to stream!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|All star cast, great special effects.kind of predictable, but if you are looking for movie to just relax and take you on vacation: this is it!
0307895475|5.0|Excellent. Very complete. Has everything you need to know about the game and more. I totally recommend it. Buy it!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I've read this series from the beginning, so I am fully invested in every changeling, Psy, and human. I care for these characters and I believe in this world. Yet I worried that Heart of Obsidian would not meet my expectations. Wow, did I worry needlessly. Kaleb and Sahara's story is EXCELLENT. Beautifully written, heart-rending, and ultimately full of triumph and hope.<br />Sahara was a lovely heroine, but this is Kaleb's story.  Kaleb--where to start? The abuse he suffered as a child and young man is almost inconceivable. He was always alone until Sahara, so for Kaleb, only Sahara matters. I have to write it again because that sentence just doesn't capture Kaleb's truth: for him, there is Only. Sahara.<br />Because of this truth, what he is willing to endure for her, do for her, risk for her, is awe-inspiring, and quite frankly, kind of frightening. He would burn down the world for her without blinking, but instead, he saves the world.  For Sahara.<br /><br />PS: I think \\"Radioactive\\" by Imagine Dragons is the perfect song for the recent developments in Singh's Psy/changeling universe and for Kaleb too. Check it out!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|First of all the ppl calling it Risk 2 obvious didn't listed to the whole album. IMO Risk was their weakest album. I'd say Cryptic Writings 2 for sure!! At first it was like WTF listening to the samples. Buy the 3rd time listening (like with any new album before you review it) I Love it... There is some excellent songs on here, and no its not selling out when you choose to put an album out like this. When the studio makes ya do it that's a sell out. After 30 yrs Megadeth continues to constantly put out solid albums.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I bought stabbing the drama in 2005, listened to it didn't think much about, liked it but didn't love it! That was the first time I heard soilwork, I guess I was looking for the next killswitch engage or mudvanye or even pantera. It took a couple of years for their sound to grow on me. But a fellow metal head friend got me back into them I bought the panic brodscast in loved it at first listen went back and got their back catalog. And was just blew away by their music they don't have a bad album. So I was so excited when I heard the were releasing a double album. When it came it was everything I hoped it would the songs are amazing, bjorn sings great, better then he ever has its a metal masterpiece and I have found my next pantera and Metallica!
B006K1IIHA|3.0|Thank goodness I have other ways to watch Blu-Rays besides My Panasonic Blu-Ray player because this set will not play at all.  I am able to get it to work on my Computer only.  BBC should try to meet the standard that most Blu-Ray players use, especially when the movies are not Region TWO.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this series and already have it preodered so I can receive the dvd's as soon as they come out.  Sherlock is very similar to how the books pictured him although there is a lot of debate on that issue.  I always found him a seriously flawed individual.  He was driven to solve cases partially by ego, partially to distract him from his addiction to opiates.  I love the way Johnny miller plays him, he's egotistical and very self absorbed but driven to solve his cases.  Not really to make the victims feel better, I don't believe.  More cause he can't stand to lose and not to solve a puzzle.  Watson as a woman is very interesting.  She complements him and I love how they are buddies, like 2 guys.  I don't know how they'd be as a couple, not sure I want them as a couple.  They make a great pair though.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Awesome movie about love, hope and perseverance. Characters are adorable and both children and adults will love this movie! This will be an all time classic!
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|If you like movies that challenge the mind and today's politics such as V for Vendetta and Dark City.. You will like this movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love reading historical fiction and this is the best I've read yet! For me personally, the beginning was slow. After I got into it,though, I couldn't stop. Must read is all I can say.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After reading the first two books in this series, I had anticipated so much more from this author. This book has lots of sex as filler, but was very short on story.  It's almost like the author lost interest in the characters and didn't know where to go with the story and just wanted to get the book out.  Not worth buying....
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using for over two years and I'm in love with it. Every time I change phones this is a must download
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is laugh out loud hysterical.  I had to double check that the author is a woman as it is written from a man's point of view.  The main character is a self-centered, arrogant jerk (who is handsome, rich, loves his work and  loves his 4 yr old niece) and then he meets \\"the one\\"..... such a fun, good book and so well done.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe this author did this! First, they publish the third book so long after the second one, I almost didn't care enough to read it. Now, I'm sorry I did! Maybe Sylvia Day needs figure out what a trilogy is before she writes anything else. This dragging out of a once great storyline has made the story a joke. Not sure where she's heading with this but it sure looks like its a ploy for $. I was so excited about this third book coming out but now I'm just sorry that I bought it. I won't be purchasing any more of this \\"5 Part 'Trilogy' \\"!! This story had such potential in the beginning but Sylvia has turned it into a joke. Save your money.
B008602KQI|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would like this movie when I started watching it, but it was so captivating through out the whole movie.  I didn't even realize how long it was while watching it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My daughter and I both love playing the game, but it is frustrating us to no end that it keeps freezing on us and I have to forcestop it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Completely done with this series. If i want to know later on how it ends I'll Google it. No character development, boring mushy  'i love yous' I'm very disappointed and I think sylvia is in it for the money now....no inspiration at all.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Truly a great mind puzzle. It was definitely too short but well worth the money spent. Can not wait for the next chapter. This isn't a hidden picture game like so many others, just pure puzzle work. I loved it.
B0027MJU00|5.0|An excellent read! I couldn't put it down.  The characters were beautifully flawed and the plot intriguing .  My air journey passed in a flash.  I will be looking out for more by this author.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|As an atheist, I am very pleased with AIC taking a position supporting reason and science.  Well Done.  The lyrics on TDPDH makes a statement without being overly unkind to the millions embraced in this mass delusion.  I love the variety of songs in AIC style.  It took a few listens to fully digest and hear everything.  Very satisfied overall.  Not DIRT and this is a new era, yet excellent and stands on its own.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Every song from the radio I have put into Shazam, it recognizes just right away. I know it is almost imposible to know each single song around the whole worl, but I'm pretty positive that it will become better and better with time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer I think it is a very awesome game and I am addicted to it my favorite part is when you upgrade then you go through different things and have different
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Just got it today, but can't wait to watch the whole thing. The first two season were awesome. I'm excited to see season 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very very good game that i ever downloaded on my kindle you really have to download this game its amazing loveyou bye!xx:)
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but it's not a GREAT one, just a good one.  I think it's probably better as an audio book since Tina Fey reads it herself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|To me this is the best app ever. I downloaded it and my saw me playing it and she said I looked like I was into it. Later she asked me what the game was called. I told her Subway Surfers. Soon enough my whole family was playing this game. Download Subway Surfers now!!!!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|For me, my disappointment usually comes when I realize the story ends..and the waiting sucks....but I'm thrilled there's going to be 2 more books.  AND I also wasn't discouraged by the extra 'fat' in the storyline by introducing the BS of the other characters.  I love Gideon & Eva and their sex is H-O-T....I'll never get enough of that!<br /><br />I agree with everyone's state of mind on the fact that it was a HUGE disappointment that we've all waited so long for this book, with the release date being pushed out, what twice?  And then to have it end so abruptly with the announcement there's books yet to come.  TOTALLY agree, but it's the waiting that's going to kill me, not that there's more.  So my only regret is finding this series before it was complete.  So my only advice, if you CAN wait, I would. One, you won't have to wait like the rest of us. Two, maybe you can get the series much cheaper.  I know for me personally, will be giving this series out to my besties as gifts.....maybe 5 years from now (LOL),maybe, once the whole series is out in paperback..,because I still think it's a good series.<br /><br />In conclusion....I hope you all don't give up on Sylvia Day,more importantly, Gideon & Eva.....it's a hot story and more to come!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a good game you need to download this app because it's awesome .I beat my high score so the time once you get use to it and in the game you would learn to love it.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie, several times now. I greatly recommend it for one viewpoint of the Nazi Aryan notion of greatness being smashed. Though it is clearly fictional it succeeds in making it's point. quite well. Loved the movie fire scenes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm very much enjoying playing this game can you believed that you can by a unicorn. The graphics are amazing. And dressing your horse is a blast. I'm gunna go play some more... bye
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is a wildly exciting book and very hard to put down. This is where the series really gets going. :)
B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle  give the best performances  of their careers. This is a video that you  can watch you can watch over and over without getting tired of it.  It is very  close to the original story.  Truly a treasure.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Grateful I get to catch up with my show!! Great picture and sound. I am very satisfied with my purchase!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|My family and I quite enjoyed The Adventures of Tintin! Well-paced and well-written (it combines three of the books together, as I recall). Once started, we didn't stir from our couches until the ending .... it certainly draws you in!<br />Some violence and suggestion of violence, but clean language, humor, and overall, highly recommended!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is the best game ever made but it is hard I like a little challenge to start my day
B000Q99EAC|3.0|My family continues to enjoy the Rocky series (my 7 year old is just getting into it), even if it went on a little too long. This was first time I'd seen this movie and as a hopeless romantic over Rocky and Adrian's love affair, I was quite disappointed to not see<br />Adrian in this movie. I think the actress knew what we all already knew, this was 2nd of 2 too many Rocky movies<br />made and probably all would have been fine if we did not have it. With that said, anyone else wonder how Balboa make a full recovery from his brain injury??? (Rocky IV to V)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|What a shame!! I looked forward to the release of this third book in the series to only be dissappointed in the storyline and to learn that the third book in the series is NOT THE END!!I feel taken advantage of by the author and will no longer read her books. I'm sorry Eva and Gideon, but I guess I'll imagine my own ending to you love story. Clearly, the author is only interested in stringing along her readers and making as much money as possible on a series that should have ended with book 3.
B000I9YLWG|4.0|Tame by today's standards (or even compared to contemporaries like Mario Bava) but well put together nonetheless, especially the first forty minutes or so leading up to Janet Leigh's infamous shower scene.  The camerawork is gothic noir--Hitchcock trying on Orson Welles.  There's a feel for wide-open, uninhabited Western spaces and arid landscapes in much of the film too that adds to the claustrophobic terror.  Bernard Herrmann's score really brings out the full menace and madness in the flat, dull surfaces and bland characterizations--one can see Hitchcock seething with envy at the stolen spotlight.  It would have been interesting if some extra Freudian layers had been added with Leigh coquettishly flirting with Perkins only to turn him down.  That would have added an extra dimension to his character's psychosis.  The film seems to lose something after Leigh is killed off with the remainder something of a who-done-it rehash.  But I suppose what revelations there were were pretty wild in its day and kept the audience engaged.
B00CWVGS10|5.0|This is about knowing and embracing who you are while, being committed to doing what's best for everyone. Great story about self, family and community needs and opportunities to be supportive of one another. AND, it's fun!!
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Interesting, but not as compelling as Downton Abbey. The characters are acceptably interesting, but somewhat difficultto love as the Abbey characters.  Still though, I enjoyed the &#34;class&#34; portrayals.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book. I think Rebecca wrote a well balanced story that connected all the system problems and a complex healthcare system. And she did it with both head and heart. Lovely!
B008R6MI8G|4.0|I'll avoid plot spoilers for the most part. This film won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival.<br /><br />Some people love to read history, others do not. If you have wondered why the Irish, after basically &#34;winning&#34; the Irish War of Independence, then had a quick civil war and why to this day Northern Ireland is part of the UK, this is one of the movies you should see. Also, if you want to be freaked out by seeing Severus Snape as one of the heroes of Irish Independence, here's your flick.<br /><br />My favorite part is really the first half: it's gripping, starts out with the Easter Rising (song: Foggy Dew, best known version by the Chieftains with Sin&eacute;ad O'Conor singing) in 1916, mentions in passing that most of the men in the Frongoch internment camp for months after that were teaching each other the principles of Revolution, and continues to follow Michael Collins and Eamon De Valera and their friends through the Irish War of Independence (1919-21), in scenes which are by turns scary, hilarious, or tender. The War of Independence ended with British withdrawal from the south and British administrative partition of the country -- and that was the source of the trouble that led to the Civil War (1922). And that is where our heroes are thrown into conflict with one another.<br /><br />The representatives who negotiated the peace (oh, no! Our romantic lead is the negotiator!) agreed to the partition, and allowed Northern Ireland to still be a part of the UK, while the south became a Dominion of the British Empire called the Irish Free State.<br /><br />You see what happened? A large number of their mates back home in Ireland were powerfully angry, felt betrayed. One side thought it was the only way to end the war, and they might as well start with what they were being offered and work toward full independence and reunification later, the other side said there would never be a better time than now, and that this was a waste of all the lives that had been spent in the struggle. Very dramatic, ultimately very violent, and our film's hero, Michael Collins, must confront his closest friends over this -- and in some ways he's defending a position he never wanted to occupy in the first place.<br /><br />If you want another moving, although more fictionalized, view of this time in Irish history, see The Wind That Shakes The Barley (made ten years later, but based in the same time period, it won a Palm D'or at the Cannes Film Festival). The two together do an effective job of showing the powerful motivations and justifiable positions of both sides (actually there were more than two sides, but it settled out into &#34;mostly&#34; two) in the Civil War, although of course the British don't come off well in either -- what were you expecting?!  This movie does not explain the origin of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, really, except to include the partition as a fact; it mostly focuses on events in the south. And the beautiful landscape and people and music of Ireland are all featured in both films, which make them visually glorious.t had been spent in the struggle.

B00CRW2066|5.0|I own several albums by The National and consider myself a fan. This release is very good. I've always admired the songwriting by the group and this album doesn't disappoint in this area. Good effort from a band that has shown they can deliver great music consistently.
B00957T6X6|3.0|Many years in the writing, and immensely popular in their current form as a TV series, the Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire) books all contain explicit sex scenes - both heterosexual and otherwise, including incest and sex with minors - as well as explicit tortures and mutilations and so forth -- not the kind of thing you want your young ones reading. It's kind of like \\"Saw meets Sword and Sorcery meets Rome:The Series.\\"  Perfectly OK as escapist literature if you don't mind the nastiness and the feeling that no beloved character will come out of this series better off or even necessarily alive (except the author).<br /><br />I do understand that it can be argued that the whole point of this nastiness is that the \\"game of thrones\\" itself is an utterly dangerous game and that huge numbers of people have been sacrificed to it, as well as that war allows monsters to flourish. It even makes the point that a good and honest man may on occasion be exactly the wrong person for a political post.  All of these points are important, and anyone who reads these books would have to be dozing not to \\"get\\" them. However, these points can be made without going deeply into the physical details, and this is not history, it's fantasy (complete with dragons), so the desire for gritty realism, emphasis on the gritty, can only be the result of the author's personal preference, admixed with a fine instinct (the author once wrote for TV) for what will play well on a screen. If the latter was calculated, it was certainly effective. As seems downright fashionable, the author is willing to kill off major characters in horrible and/or pointless ways (quite a few, spread across these five books), which will also disturb young readers, and even some adult readers, but which impressed the New York Times critic no end. In their favor, these books will make you laugh aloud sometimes. And occasionally something redemptive happens. For a little while. Don't get comfortable.<br /><br />Fantasy used to be a way for people to escape whatever suffering they were experiencing in their own lives, that's why they called it \\"escapist literature.\\" It may indeed have told them against all reason that good would eventually triumph and virtue be eventually rewarded, but that's part of consensual reality -- if you choose to make it true, if enough people choose to make it true, it will be, for we will all act in ways that make it so. Otherwise, not so much: the forces of economics and ages-old patterns of human behavior are against it.  With \\"gritty\\" lit, we are simply trading our suffering for the ghoulish sensation of watching the fictional sufferings of others, which are, in all likelihood, far more gruesome than our own. It's visceral, but something essential to culture is missing from the experience. Somehow, it feels like the schadenfreude side of this series isolates us rather than giving us a common dream. We will come away with a common dystopian meme, perhaps.<br /><br />The books are well-plotted and very competently written (the writer is famous in the SF, Fantasy and Horror genres and has been Science Fiction Writers of America Vice-President) and out of curiosity I finished them, but part of me was hoping that this would get better -- that somehow some character would actually survive the train wreck of war and politics and rise above his/her own troubles and limitations, have some wonderful moment of illumination and make a decision or alliance that would lead to some good ultimate result. However, I strongly suspect it will not, having read all five of the thus-far series, and knowing that the next one will famously be a long while in coming. So, if you are curious to see what all the fuss is about, buy the eBook, but keep it out of reach of the young ones. Usually, I love fantasy and SF, but this series made me want to go read nonfiction. Not the vacation I signed up for... which might actually please the author!used to be a way for people to escape whatever suffering they were experiencing in their own lives, that's why they called it \\"escapist literature.\\" It may indeed have told them against all reason that good would eventually triumph and virtue be eventually rewarded, but that's part of consensual reality -- if you choose to make it true, if enough people choose to make it true, it will be, for we will all act in ways that make it so.

1476734941|5.0|I really enjoyed learning about Mosley's work.  It has good science to support changing the way we eat.  I have done this diet for a month and felt the changes as my body adjusted to the new way of eating. My body feels quieter and making it easier to end my emotional eating habits.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the very few English drama shows that keep you glued to the TV. The cinematography is brilliant and the story line is engaging. Overall - 9/10
B006PTZNQQ|5.0|CLEAN, I can't stop listening. Lots of pop, little rap. Example of pop, pound the alarm. Example of rap, Roman holiday. I have know idea why people didn't like it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is far and away my favorite book of the series so far. It was so worth the wait! I laughed and I cried from the beauty of Gideon and Eva's love. The first 9 chapters were a perfect start to the book. So sweet and romantic. And the book just got better and better as I read it.<br /><br />Yes, there are external forces that attempt to keep them apart, but that's called CONFLICT, which is necessary for a story, especially romance. And sure, I yelled at my Kindle when I got frustrated. But what kept me reading were Gideon and Eva, because when they're together, they are AMAZING! They are a force to be reckoned with!<br /><br />And THAT is exactly why I can't wait for the last 2 books! Ms. Day has outdone herself with Entwined with You. Her writing is fluid and smooth and just an utter joy to read.<br /><br />On a personal note--to all of you who have written the one star reviews, all I can say is you are going to miss out on the conclusion to a wonderful, beautifully crafted series.
