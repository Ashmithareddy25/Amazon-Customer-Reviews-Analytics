B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great season. The acting is still great, and the plot lines are still well written and on target. If you like period drama, this is for you.
034580404X|3.0|Used 2-day shipping and did not arrive until the day after when I needed it the most for a gift. However, I did hear from the person I gave the gift that she is enjoying the book, so<br />Book=5 stars<br />Shipping-2 stars
B005ZUR724|5.0|A well made game for my Kindle Fire.  It plays a lot like many computer mmos. A bit pricker than many games though. There is a small subscription fee to keep playing.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I don't see what people mean by the acting not being quality. I thought it was amazing. The action was steady and had some huge spikes of action as expected. The story line was well weaved together to illustrate what great lengths the Navy Seals do to protect this country. Absolutely worth it to buy, and the Blu Ray looks spectacular.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it is awesome it works great and it the best way to get free songs....sometimes it takes a little bit to load
0553801473|2.0|Up through maybe book 3 this series was moderately entertaining.  It becomes less and less interesting (or logical) with each succeeding book.  I have completed book 5 and would frankly recommend a new reader not waste any money on ANY of the books.  However, if you have started, don't expect anything in books 4 and 5 to resolve anything.  In fact, don't even expect them to make any sense.  Characters change their spots in ways  that seem unrelated to previous happenings.  It's some of the worst writing I have ever read.  It's as if the author started out with some good ideas, got to a certain point and then essentially thought, \\"what happens now?\\".  So he just kept writing \\"at random\\" as thoughts danced through his head.<br /><br />Don't know what to do as you write your book(s)?  Well just ignore what has already happened, add some new, pointless characters, endless pages of filler that does nothing, and keep on writing.<br /><br />Don't waste the time or money like I did.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|This was a great part 2, lots of action, and the sibal reval between brothers, and Zues love for his son.<br />I liked this this movie and so will you.

0345803485|1.0|Kinky? It struck me as domestic abuse. The man hurting the woman, then fawning over her, telling her he loves her, and all the while rationalizing that she deserved it.<br /><br />I'm stunned that the books are so popular. Do most women want to be trussed up like a turkey during love making?<br /><br />And then to discover that it's a Twilight fan fiction. All of the characters personalities are stolen.
B0086700CM|5.0|so addicting and fun. you don't really have to spend real money unless you want to unlock all the items and characters faster. so much fun!!  :)
B00884GR0W|4.0|I love this game so much that I had to buy the full version. The only thing I don't like is the one-time use weapon and picks. Other than that, I think its really fun! I play this until my kindle dies!
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan and haven't seen him in anything that I didn't like.  What was he thinking when he agreed to this horror?!  I guess he was a fan of Hunter Thompson but that's no excuse for this terrible mess.  Depp doesn't even look good here, and that's saying something.<br /><br />The film showed some promise in the opening scenes:  Puerto Rico in 1960, hot and colorful and those beautiful beaches.  Then there's just enough intrigue with the really bad guy, (played wonderfully by Aaron Eckart) and his really hot girlfriend who is obviously looking for trouble wherever she can find it....But it soon lapses into a really sophomoric, self indulgent tirade of the Good Guys, who get constantly wiped out on rum and drugs, vs. the Bad Guys.  The Depp character, who is obviously based on Thompson, is supposed to be The Voice of Righteousness fighting against the Bastards of the world.  He recites lines from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and quotes Oscar Wilde to let us know how thoughtful he really is...when he isn't drunk. He tries to save the paper because the editor who is one of the Bad guys has left....etc..and we're supposed to cheer on his heroic act.  By this time I've long since cared about the guy.  Depp is so bad in this role...I'm amazed!  It's possible that another actor could really pull it off and make us believe this guy and care about him, but Depp is just pasty faced, bland and  (I hate to say it)...pudgy.  yuk.  We're supposed to cheer as he sails off in a stolen sailboat to some stirring music...and cheer some more as the words on the screen say that he made it to New York where he married the hot chick and became a successful journalist.  Oh my....!!!  I suppose if there are some retards around who get off on the illusion that booze, drugs and creating havoc is really cool....then they will Love this film!
0451532082|5.0|I am so glad and grateful that Louisa May Alcott was cajoled into writing a novel for girls. LITTLE WOMEN has stood the test of time since it was published as two separate works: \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives.\\" We readers are privy to a fictionalized story of the Alcott family to a certain extent, but yet a totally different household is described. Set in Massachusetts during and in the immediate years after the Civil War, Alcott introduces strong characters that have truly become beloved by many a reader.<br /><br />The four March girls - pragmatic Meg, free spirited Jo, sweet Beth, and artistic but childish Amy - live in genteel poverty with their devoted and strong Marmee. Mr. March is away, serving as a Chaplin in the Civil War. Despite their impoverished status, the girls are happy; they have one another. They work. They play: clever productions abound due to Jo's pen and wild imagination. Music is gentle Beth's contribution, while Amy loves beautiful things and tries to capture them in her art. Their circle becomes larger as the \\"good boy\\" next door shares their fun and gives what he can to the Marches and Teddy seals his status as the little women's adoptive brother.<br /><br />The second half of LITTLE WOMEN opens with Meg's wedding. Mr. March is now home fully recovered from pneumonia that shook the sisters, but little Beth seems weaker from the life threatening illness that almost tumbled the March foundation. Even old Mr. Lawrence is changed. No one really sees Beth's withering health and life goes along. Jo leaves home to work as a governess to a family friend. She has to put distance between her and \\"her boy.\\" She has plenty of time to write and soon finds her destiny. Amy is abroad traveling with her Aunts March and Carol and also meets her destiny.<br /><br />I never tire reading this wonderful story. Miss Alcott is an exquisite writer. Some words may be outdated, but great writing is not. Her characterization rings true to each girl and Laurie, though I am still mystified why Alcott chose Marmee to get Meg's first kiss after she was declared married to her groom. Amy was another surprise - I had always thought she was shallow and spoiled, but she is the character who underwent the most transformation. I finally liked all four sisters. Like so many of my favorite books, I put LITTLE WOMEN back upon my shelves feeling bittersweet that I finished it.gh I am still mystified why Alcott chose Marmee to get Meg's first kiss after she was declared married to her groom.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|If you are a fan of the show, you know that it continues to get crazier and crazier. Season 4 is pretty awesome, hate to say its the best of the seasons, but the show builds for a reason. Cost $10 less than at walmart too! Thank you amazon
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is fun but after a while it gets boring...... if u like this game then I would try bakery story, farm story, fashion story, nightclub story, pet shop story, and zoo story
B007URCTOG|5.0|The story behind is what makes this movies so great. It is a struggle of a man who wants to get back his wife and love of his life. What really struck me is, the way how she felt in love with him for a second time. And the big realization at the end that if something is bound to happen in our life it will happen no matter what we want and how many fears we have. Great life-love story and movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app is the best app you can get for a calculater. when I first got this app I thought it was stupid but then I found out it wasn't.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|This game is fun and well made, BUT a $1.25 plus alot more to complete the game via IAP is plain greed and is unacceptable to myself and others.<br />Get the hint yet devs?<br />Charge a fair price upfront and stop the double paying standard alot of you have jumped on.<br />We have no problem paying $5+ for a well made game, but we won't pay twice or multiple times for any game.<br />I make plenty of money and can afford what ever I want to spend on mobile, console or pc games.<br />With that said, I'm not gullible nor do I just hand my money away. I look for value and challenge factor. When someone wants me to pay for a game and then keep charging me to keep playing, you have lost me as a potential customer and others!

B008133DO8|4.0|Sherlock is an excellent series. The show has a compelling antihero, a likeable sidekick, and an intriguing main villain. The secondary characters are interesting as well, in particular Mrs. Hudson, Molly and Mycroft. Sgt Donovan is wonderfully spiteful and is a character you love to hate. Hopefully there will be more of her in future episodes.<br /><br />Watson seems like a regular guy, but he's much more than that. He's loyal, courageous and a real hero. Sherlock is a man of mystery who has repressed his emotions to enhance his career, though one gets the feeling he's created this persona as a form of self-protection. He has moments of vulnerability that prevent the character from being a one-dimensional know-it-all.<br /><br />The updated stories are clever twists on the originals. Though it's clearly modern, certain images and moments stir feelings of the past. From Holmes and Watson's auspicious first meeting in A Study in Pink to the gut-wrenching end of  The Reichenbach Fall, this series is almost always satisfying. The only fault rests in the first episode of season two.<br /><br />A Scandal in Belgravia is the weakest episode of both seasons and was the deciding factor between a 4 and 5 star rating from this reviewer. The Irene Adler character has never been a favorite of mine, but in this series she sinks to a new low. Sherlock unfortunately relies on the common and disappointing theme that a woman cannot be powerful and cunning without relying on her sexuality. If handled differently, this modern Irene Adler could have been a respectable challenge for a man without equal. Instead their interaction degraded the otherwise remarkable character of Sherlock Holmes. By his infatuation with a glorified prostitute, he turns out to be as ordinary as Moriarty labels him in The Great Game. It will take a great deal of redemption in season three for this particular Holmes to recapture the aura he emanated prior to Irene Adler, but I have high hopes for him and look forward to more in this overall fantastic series.

1439127700|5.0|this is one of the most interesting book i have ever read.  Not because it is exciting, but it is informative.  It is not based on emotion, but based on fact.  It goes back to Hoover through Truman and presidents to today.  The thing i liked about it is the thought process of the Presidents and how they reacted.  It hanged  my persepetive of a number of them,  Especially Eisenhower.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that has an interest of how the Presidency is run.  It kind of makes you sit back and think.  It really does. Its a purchase, in my opinion, that you won't regret.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is awesome I love it I have an ipad and the graphics are awesome on it. me and my sister actually. fight over the game not the device. I say DOWNLOAD IT RIGHT NOW!RIGHT NOW
B004Y12S9W|4.0|When first fitted, the sound didn't work, so we hazarded a guess that it was the standard quality HDMI cable that was the problem. When we switched it out for the highest spec HDMI cable we could find, it was fine. The picture quality of Netflix isn't perfect, but it does the trick. Videos and photos are crisper images.
B006H8BIIM|2.0|Great graphics and also it has good game play. Now the bad part is the in game purchases and I completely agree that this is a terrible gaming model. However, for all rooted users our there Google gamecih or game guardian it will fix the in game purchase issues.

0345803485|3.0|This was a bunch of hype. No plot, not very well written. There are better books out there if you want to read this type of book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|ive never read any of these books so i just want to say thank you to the reviewers for saving me from wasting my hard earned money on what from all accounts is complete drivel.<br />thank you!!
0307949486|5.0|I rarely read a book after seeing the movie of said book, but after seeing the film version, I had to see if the hype around the book was true. It was. This is an excellent thriller and suspense novel while at the same time you are rooting for Lisbeth to thrive.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Thank God I lived to see it in film.<br /><br />I had no idea I'd feel such emotions when I heard the name of John Carter of Mars . . . I'm not an emotional guy. But I guess John Carter was my boyhood idol.<br /><br />Others have praised the movie enough but just let me say the acting was great as was the CGI, and although it didn't follow the books exactly it was close enough to be a fair representation.<br /><br />I hope this movie will turn into a franchise of at least 2 or more films in addition.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The game gave me an instant virus and I haven't discovered a game on it. you need to pay money let alone have to worry if your kindle may have something permanently wrong with it. not happy. ive had my kindle for awhile with no issues until this

B000JML7EC|5.0|A timeless classic. Started to read it 50 or so years ago. Now reading it again and enjoying it as much as i did when I was a kid.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|IAP = no.go.  I wont even try it, thats how you send the message.. As long as you download it and uninstall, they will continue to issue these as &quot;Free&quot; apps..  So follow my lead and just say no all together. Amazon will get the hint. Sorry to say IAP seems to be here to stay.  Ever play Diablo 3 without the RMAH... hard, repetitive, and dull, and that cost 60 bucks, just to have IAP's that cost up to 250 bucks EACH . BS I say........ ML
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very addictive app.But on a kindle fire if your score is like 765097 and you die your other score is only 55

B005RUV6RO|4.0|Waiting for the second season to be part of Netflix or Amazon Prime instant videos, I watch the first season, got hooked even thought they are some mistakes in the story I like it.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|While this wasn't my favorite season, it's still an easy five stars since it's in the top 3 of best shows currently on television.  I know there have been a lot negative reactions towards this season, and I think maybe it's for a few reasons.  Lots of people despise Megan.  And others say that \\"nothing really happened\\".  I don't really like Megan either, but I've come to accept her character.  She is SUPPOSED to be annoying (or at least can easily be interpreted as so).  We don't have to like her.  As far as nothing happening, plenty of things happened, although I admit it was a little slow-paced, but I think it's building up for better seasons to come.<br /><br />This season takes place between Memorial Day 1966 and Spring 1967.  The season focuses on Don Draper and Megan's relationship and how distracting it is from his job, and most of the main characters are facing painful new beginnings and realize it's a \\"dog-eat-dog\\" world.  The season starts out light (probably because of how dark season 4 was), but by the end of the season things are gloomier than ever.  So never fear, Mad Men isn't going soft.<br /><br />Don - one reason I enjoyed season 4 so much is that we had a break from Don being in a dramatic, serious relationship.  He was just casually dating and we were able to see more of SCDP.  Now he's married to Megan, and that opens up a lot more storylines.  You'll either love or hate Megan.  She shows signs of being very independent and mature, but then will surprise you by suddenly doing something very stupid and childish.  The big question is: how long is it until Don cheats on her?  I don't believe that Don will be in a monogamous relationship for the rest of his life.  It's also interesting how it's reminiscent of the beginning of his relationship with Betty.  Betty was a beautiful young model and Don swept her up.  When Betty got older and he got bored, he lost interest.  Megan is also a very young girl, an actress, and pretty (in Don's eyes).  What's going to happen to his fidelity to Megan in a couple years?  Or 10?  Or even by the end of the season?  When Don loses respect for someone, a lot of feelings for them deteriorate quickly.<br /><br />Don also has to deal with Megan's Canadian parents, who have a very bizarre marriage and her father is not a total believer in Don.  He thinks Megan took the easy way out by marrying a rich guy.  Megan's mother is also incredibly insecure, which is a recurring theme throughout the season.<br /><br />Betty - since January Jones is pregnant, they decided to put her in a fat suit to hide it, and turn that into a storyline.  Perfect Betty has to deal with being overweight, which makes for some interesting television.  Her appearances are very sparse, however, and you can go episodes without seeing her at all.  There is a lot of pressure on Betty to compete with Megan, especially when her children are involved.  As far as Sally goes, she goes through a lot of childhood development this season.  Glen the creepy kid also makes a couple appearances, and their relationship is really open for interpretation.  Kiernan Shipka is also a great young actress.  We also get to see Henry Francis' mother a little bit, especially when she babysits Sally.<br /><br />Pete - Pete is...well, Pete.  But cockier than ever.  He feels that all is owed to him, even as only a junior partner.  He gets incredibly demanding this season and enters into some interesting affairs.  Pete is honestly one of the most difficult characters for me to empathize with, especially this season.  Almost every thing he does is just obnoxious, not to mention he is a total hypocrite.  Vincent Kartheiser is great, however.<br /><br />Peggy - as my favorite character, I liked what they did with her this season.  She has to balance romance and work in a very sexist society, and makes some life changing decisions several times throughout the season.  I love how strong Peggy is, and in these days she would easily be a partner already.  Peggy also is Megan's boss...which is really quite inappropriate and causes a lot of awkwardness in the office.<br /><br />Joan - remember that jerk she's married to?  Yeah.  They're still married when the season starts, unfortunately.  Joan is strong though, and without spoiling anything, she makes some very questionable and life altering decisions this season regarding her romantic and work life.  I think her and Peggy learn the most this season about how when it boils down to it, it's every wo/man for themselves.<br /><br />Lane - bitter about not getting the greatest deal out of this partnership, Lane makes some...questionable business decisions this season.  He becomes much more prevalent later in the season, and without spoiling much, he gets into a very....entertaining \\"discussion\\" with Pete.  I think Jared Harris is amazing for this role.<br /><br />Roger - talked into taking LSD with Jane, Roger has a very memorable and insightful trip.  Although the acid trip was a little stereotypical, there's nothing funnier than watching Roger doing acid.  The trip also has longer implications for him in the season.  Additionally, Roger enters into a very odd romantic relationship with an unexpected character.<br /><br />And it's not just the characters that will suck you in and keep you watching.  The context of show is amazingly interesting.  We get to see references to the Richard Speck murders, Charles Witman's shooting rampage, toxic clouds of smog over NYC, the Hare Krishnas, and the Rolling Stones.  Also some interesting clients this season: Heinz, Jaguar, Mohawk Airlines, American Cancer Society, Manischewitz, Dow Chemical, and Virginia Slims.<br /><br />You could watch this show for the amazingly intricate characters, the interesting portrayal of life in the 60s, or both.  This show is highly entertaining, addictive, and one of the best on television today.lready.

0143117009|4.0|Collapse discusses many of the stereo types regarding climate change but brings a lot of history and facts into the discussion.  It does not directly take sides so it is not a politically oriented book. That is a good thing, I liked a lot of the historical perspective.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed the book and finished it in two days. The constant use of \\"oh my\\" makes me roll my eyes, but I think it fits Ana's personality. I am not into hardcore anything, but the book made me curious to explore.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|I'm going to be totally honest. When I first heard about the movie, I mentally groaned. Why does Hollywood want to remake everything? And out of everything that can be remade they picked 21 Jump Street? :S. However I watched the trailer when it came out more out of morbid curiosity than anything else and was surprised at how funny it looked. My best friend also expressed interest so off we went to the theater.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was funny and a bit over the top but it worked. And while Channing Tatum isn't the best actor on the planet, his awkward and somewhat stiff acting style worked for this particular movie because that's exactly as you would imagine the character to act. I thought the idea that high school had changed so much from when the two leads had gone was kind of funny though not necessarily true but it worked for the film.<br /><br />I generally prefer to own blu-rays with itunes digital copies and have quite an extensive collection but I instead went directly to Itunes on this particular movie because of the ultraviolet digital copy. Ultraviolet lets you stream the movie for a year before, at the retailer's discretion, they may start charging you streaming fees. It actually says that in the UV website's fine print under the 'Streaming' section. It's just another way for the consumer to re-buy what they've already bought. I'll buy it once on Itunes in 1080p, thanks.
0345803493|5.0|Many things happen in the book that I didn't expect. Fifty Shades Darker picks up where Fifty Shades of Grey left off, literally only a couple of days have passed since Ana left. But the book focuses on Christian and Ana developing a relationship outside of just sex, (even though there's plenty of it) and it's nice to get an insight of Mr. Grey. I was shocked to find out Christian's dark secret but not so much at the same time. Again, I finished this book in two days with a smile on my face the whole time. The ending leaves you anxious to read the third book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'd heard so much about this book ago I decided to give it a try. I could not put it down. I loved it from beginning to end. There is a love story in this book despite what others may say. It's not all about sex but there are sexual encounters in the story however it's so much deeper than that. It kept me wanting to know more about the characters. Once I finished the book I immediately bought part two. You won't be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is a great game. I love how you can get points through the game and other ways like giving the game a review.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Actually quite boring....could skip pages at a time and still get gist of story.  Explicit sex is not necessary for storyline.  Excellent marketing of this book since it has no redeeming social value and yet is the talk of the town.

0345803507|5.0|I've heard the rumors...the \\"50 Shades Of Grey Trilogy\\" possessed a reputation of being little more than an explicit novel only reserved for readers who share the same explicit taste in porn. Out of curiosity, I took a peek into book #1. I realized quickly that, even though the books proved 2 be explicit in some areas to a degree, an incredible beautifully crafted love story w/characters any person walking down the street could relate to & appreciate. After reading & completing the entire trilogy, these books made me laugh, cry, pull at my heart strings & watch in awe as love prevails over seemingly impossible situations. This is without a doubt one of the most unique, heartfelt, well written love stories I've ever read. Amazon alone gives each book a minimum of 4 1/2 stars from over 6,000+ readers. With that in mind, I was right in trusting my instinct not to believe the rumors. My only regret? Not reading the books sooner.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love story with a bite and a quite spicy1 Got a bit boring in parts..Some of it unnecessary but fun!
0345803493|5.0|After reading book 1, I was more than eager to read book 2.<br /><br />This book has ups and downs, mainly with the characters. They are learning, growing, and understanding themselves and each other. The story line picks up right after where book #1 leaves off. Each chapter leaves you thirsty for more (in a non-sexual sense, although I will agree that the sex scenes are incredibly graphic). The author articulates what is happening in each situation, with each character in a way that you are able to fully under stand i without any confusion. She crafts a beautiful work of art that allows the reader to get to know both Anastasia and Christian, and understand the \\"why's\\" of their lives (I'm trying not to spoil this book here). E.L. James should get an award for how well she helps us all understand that we all have struggles in life, especially when it comes to the forever complicating word: LOVE. Each chapter has you going for more, wanting to learn more, and shocking you at many points that you would not expect. I couldn't put this book down either!
B004DMAZQK|3.0|I hate to say that this isn't as good as their first album \\"To Lose My Life...\\" (which just kicked!) but not because it didn't live up to the first one but rather because it didn't even come close.  Is this the same band?  Certainly.  Are the sounds similar?  Very.  But \\"Ritual\\" is missing at least three things as far as I'm concerned and I have had a hard time putting my finger on them.  But I think that I finally have.  (1) I loved Harry McVeigh's vocals on their stellar freshman album and he still sings essentially the same here with dark, moody, and deep tones but there are subtle quirks and syntactical differences that were odd and catchy markers on the first album that have largely disappeared here.  His vocal delivery of the lyrical structures of the songs are more straightforward and thus less interesting and even less emotionally evocative.  There's not a single song on this album that can stand up to any number of the songs on the first album.  It just makes me want to go back and to listen to \\"Death\\", \\"Fifty On Our Foreheads\\", \\"Unfinished Business\\", \\"Nothing To Give\\", or \\"The Price Of Love\\" all the more.  (2)  The music maintains its '80s gothic alternative pop dynamics but is less stark and a bit lighter in the way that it is presented here.  The first album's deep and doubled-down bass is not nearly so much here and the frequently present ominous guitar tones are not as frequent or as ominous here.  It is unfair to compare the music on this outing as a shadow to the first album's sonic joys as there isn't that stark of a difference but the subtle differences make this album miss the mark.  The musical repetitions here don't add interest because they don't add elements like they did on \\"To Lose My Life...\\".  (3)  The lyrics on both albums are intriguing but on \\"Ritual\\" they are more cryptic and more open to interpretation though steering into Catholic or Anglican religious imageries might make one feel that they are less open to interpretation (not true here).  On \\"To Lose My Life...\\" they were frequently more obvious, telling mini (and sometimes heartbreaking) stories that in large part because they were more definitive were also more satisfying.  I couldn't get any solid grips on what was going on throughout this album and it ended up leaving me cold.  I really wish that this was not the case but they may redeem themselves yet with a third album.  Here's hoping.<br /><br />Highlights: album opener \\"Is Love\\" and the relationship breaking \\"Bigger Than Us\\".here).

0345803485|5.0|I was extremely apprehensive about reading this book at all. I heard the rumors, and even though I did hear many of them from a reliable source, the rumors came from people that hadn't read the book themselves, or the synopsis.<br /><br />So, I gave in sent a sample to my Kindle for book one. Anastasia Steele is a character that we can all relate to. She's cautious, yet eager to learn and up for any challenge. She is also intelligent, but with a \\"smart mouth\\" and doesn't hold back when the fate of her friends or even herself hangs in the balance. Christian Grey is impossible to understand at first. He gives away very little and prides himself on that fact. He is wise beyond his years, yet allows his \\"boyish\\" inner child out in areas throughout the book that will make you fall head over heels for. Someone you surprise yourself by actually trusting, right along with Ana. Go figure!<br /><br />Yes, there are explicit scenes, but the rumors of these books being nothing but porn is greatly exaggerated. The story line takes off within a couple of chapters. The \\"encounters\\" they have will have you hooked into this book and well through into book 3 and finish. If you can endure watching a sex scene in a rated \\"R\\" movie, you can endure this book.<br /><br />This is the first book of this genre I've read and I was extremely pleased with the character development. Witty, charming, pulls at your heart strings while mixing in some of love's greatest challenges and the mystery that is also known as \\"man\\". lol Enjoy!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cringe to even give this book one star.  Besides the poor writing, I want to know when porn and smut became the mainstream.  These characters are not believable or likable, and the story is very predictable.  I would NEVER recommend this book to another person.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This was a superb story, a very ingenious way to write a mystery.  I couldn't put it down.  I would like to read more from this author.
4805311193|3.0|The first thing to really take me out of this book was the insane punctuation. And I'm not talking about long Os which I fully understand and agree with, and while it's presumptuous to assume anyone reading's studied Japanese, it's really patronizing to think that everyone reading doesn't know how to say the names of things. I'm certain the writer (or editor?) doesn't understand what é means, because that not only effects the pronunciation but also in most cases should mean where the accent of the word is, which Japanese words have none. Also, an apostrophe is a stop which is also misleading because when saying Teradaya you don't actually stop before the ya... you just pronounce it in Japanese. Also I think this was done for the reason that ya means room... in which case isn't is a hyphen? SPEAKING of hypens, where in Japan is Utsu-nomi-ya? Because I'm pretty sure the nearest city to me's Kanji was broken into U, Tsu, no (not actually written but said) and Miya (also, why would you need to break apart the name?)... Despite my feelings towards this type of writing, it was only going to bring it down to 4 stars, because it's only a small problem that nags at you and makes you ask yourself if you're reading about Japanese history or Pokémon.<br /><br />The other big thing is something everyone seems to agree on, there are words used over and over again that make the whole book redundant and kind of cheap. Also it's a little bit mellow-dramatic. You don't need to tell me that it was cold-blooded murder, I can already tell that from historical facts. Propensity to kill is of course the other big one, mentioning that a group of men who were known for enough murders to shame Okada Izo had a tendency to kill is already really redundant, then to mention it 80 more times only worsens it. The writer brings up these sort of half-baked analyses and themes that weren't mentioned, bangs on about them and maybe forgets them for a while. The worst is the mention of the Sun Goddessin the last few chapters; \\"I'm sorry I didn't know this was a theme, oh there it is again and again...\\" So the whole analysis is that the Shinsengumi leaders were cold-blooded killers who had a tendency to kill and were very self important. Excuse me for thinking that this isn't a point that really needs to be analyzed, but if you must, do it with evidence and historical fact only.<br /><br />What these two things have in common is essentially \\"bad writing\\" yet everything factual that is presented is interesting, so it's really only the fact that every few minutes the writing gets really patronizing and redundant. I found myself enjoying the overall story and finding a lot of intrigue in what actually happened (Kondo Isami was blamed for Ryoma's murder, not surprised but I didn't know that since Kyoto's historical museum never mentioned it) so it's definitely worth a read, but if you see anything that sticks out as odd, don't think it's going anywhere, because it's not.

0345803485|1.0|I don't feel bad trashing this book since this lady is making like 2 million a week off this piece of garbage. I feel towards this book the same way I feel toward women who are obsessed with Twilight. GET OVER IT. Seriously, this book is so far in it's own fantasy world, none of it is believable.<br />Are people so sexually starved or unwilling to read good books that crap like this gets to the #1 book on the best sellers list? Really? American's have no idea what good music, movies or books are anymore. Please don't try to turn BDSM into a pop phenom, many of us have been playing with that culture for years now and have no desire for it to be watered down and sold to the American public.<br />Only teenagers or bored stay at home moms will like this book. It is simply ridiculous with zero redeemable qualities. Period. Bear in mind this book revolves around a perfect in everyway 26 year old BILLIONAIRE. LOL.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|This book starts off great but then just fizzles out over the long haul. After about 100 pages the story gets pretty unbelievable and the ending is just simply bad.

B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I never watched this movie until this past year because I didn't care anything for Oliver Stone.<br /><br />I never had an opinion about the Kennedy assassination because even though I know where I was when I heard the news, I wasn't old enough, alert enough and astute enough to recognize that the media rolled over and played stupid just like the authorities told them to do. The truth initially and immediately came out on the news but the authorities gave them a different story and EVERYONE in the media exchanged the facts for the lies they were told to report and unfortunately, even a few years ago, before he died, Peter Jennings was still spouting the same lies even though the truth is now all over the Internet.<br /><br />This isn't about \\"believe what we tell you,\\" anymore. There is so much information on the Internet and so many people have done their \\"homework,\\" and a very thorough job has been done by so many that an amazing amount of information has been compiled, including the scores and scores of murders to cover up the complicity of LBJ, the Warren Commission, the Dallas Police Dept., the FBI, the Secret Service and the CIA. (Notice I only mentioned legal authorities, not the mob -- then they later murdered Robert Kennedy. I haven't investigated, but wouldn't be surprised if the same people were responsible for MLK.)<br /><br />It's been absolutely devastating. It's no wonder so many people refuse to deal with it, look at it or consider it. What patriotic American wants to think our government is just as wicked as the Soviet Union or any other \\"evil empire\\"? It's hard to take; it's hard to face; it's hard to swallow, but the evidence is absolutely overwhelming. Our government is evil and the news media is complicit even though they pretend to be the watchdog of the public interest. What a lie.<br /><br />In the investigation I did in only the last two years (simply because I was hearing so much about the assassination that I thought I'd finally start paying attention, previously having no opinion about it), it was heart-wrenching, being a law-abiding citizen who easily choked up or teared up when either the National Anthem or America the Beautiful was played. I thought we really were a great nation.<br /><br />I'm not a racist and there are good black men for whom I would vote, for president, but I was flabbergasted and appalled when Obama was elected (even though Obama isn't black, but Mulatto, blacks have identified with him for the worst of reasons). It was obvious from the get go that this man was a liar and a fraud and an evil man unqualified to be president, even before I knew anything about his hiding his past.<br /><br />Yet, who in government or the media has made the deal out of the many issues that expose this man simply isn't qualified to be president and isn't a man of character and honor? The most powerful man in the world has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to hide his past and neither our representatives nor the media care?!?! This is so terribly wrong!<br /><br />It was after this national travesty, at which I was completely dumbfounded that I started looking at the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />Friends, all the evidence is there. The government not only murdered the president but every president since, I'm convinced, knew about it and I think this is what emboldened the Clintons in their many crimes. \\"No biggie. We can get away with it.\\" And they have gotten away with so much -- that is also all over the Internet, but the news media won't tell you and your elected representatives won't tell you either EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW.<br /><br />Now, Obama, lying through his teeth and claiming he's a Christian, has openly mocked the Bible but his every reference to the qur'an is preceded by the word \\"Holy.\\" He's the first president in history to announce to our enemies that we are not a Christian nation and he's the only president to bow to an islamic leader, and celebrate and honor islamic holidays in the White House while snubbing traditional Christian events.<br /><br />What's the media's response to this? Are they really our watchdogs? Do we want an islamic America? Doe America understand the consequences of endorsing and embracing a religion that is dedicated to our destruction because we are \\"the great satan\\"? Am I saying something that you haven't heard?<br /><br />I'm still shaking my head in disbelief. Why did we put an enemy of this country in the White House?<br /><br />Please note when this started. Prayer in public school and Bible reading in public school were dishonestly and wrongly declared unconstitutional in 1962 and 1963 and Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Do your homework and examine any area you please regarding stability, security, trouble, crime, education, business, accomplishments, science, morals, ethics, etc., in the decades before '63 and the decades afterwards. It's night and day difference.<br /><br />That you should be scared because of the facts that the news media doesn't want you to see and realize tells me they're the only reason the government has gotten away with destroying this country.<br /><br />Examine any area you want. We were the world leader in virtually every positive way. Today we're the world leader in MANY evil ways.<br /><br />If you haven't gotten it by now, JFK tells the truth and the government is STILL LYING ABOUT IT AS IS THE NEWS MEDIA. Most of the people who would be harmed by the truth are dead, but not all of them. But you won't hear a word of truth about it from the news media.<br /><br />Our enemy is in the White House and both he and his wife hate what this nation *used* to stand for. There never was a time when everything was right about our nation, but now, is there anything right for which our nation stands?<br /><br />The banks and financial institutions have been shown to be crooked and yet who is being punished? The American taxpayer. Thanks Obama.

However, I AM against the abuse of the concept.<br /><br />This is another app that charges for a game you can not complete without paying even more for upgrades (or, in this case, playing the repetitious &quot;endless mode&quot; for an absurdly unrealistic amount of time. At least 26+ hours based on my estimates)!<br /><br />Hell no!<br /><br />Add Origin8 to the sadly ever expanding list of developers obsessed with greed.

B007YQ6SYK|4.0|While there is a retro feel to \\"Home Again\\", I think it's because Michael Kiwanuka has produced an album where he lets his songs and their arrangements take center stage.  There is none of the typical modern showboating and layering on of electronics; he instead just produces an introspective, soft feel throughout his album.  I wouldn't say that any one track knocked me out, but I like the understated approach.  This doesn't really do it justice, because it's excellent throughout, a kind of Sunday morning LP.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is one of those albums where all the songs are great and because of that it is difficult for any of them to stand out. Bridge Burning starts the album off with a very driving feel, in a way it sets the tone for the whole record. A couple songs in the album loses its feeling of rushing ahead but instead replaces it with songs like Arlandria and These Days which feel much more contemplative. However this feeling doesn't last long as the tracks Miss the Misery and I Should Have Known give a feeling of a regret and almost a yearning for the experiences of the past. The album could very well end after I Should Have Known, and it would still be a great album however it doesn't there is one last song, Walk. This final song is Dave Grohl saying he doesn't want his journey to end, and in a way because of this song alone it shows it won't, because this song is what makes the album complete. The completeness of the album is that it leaves you knowing its over and knowing nothing more should be added to it, but still wanting more. This is the Foo Fighters mastering their craft, not that the songs are better than what they have done before, but the feel of the album as a whole shows that the Foos are still on the top of their game and are still a force in music, and this is the album that made me realize the Foo Fighters are one of if not the final hope for Rock and Roll.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I bought a copy of this video from amazon and it was SENSATIONAL!!! photography beautiful, sound excellent, absolutely a wonderful introduction to an artist I had had some exposure to but not been overwhelmed by.  After watching the 2 discs, with intermission, change of clothes in between, acknowlegement of Eric Clapton and ultimately of the Albert Hall, I was entranced!  Went to see Joe a couple months later and he was sensational!  I gave my dvd to my brother and eventually went to order another.  The dvd arrived, brand new, but not nearly the same quality and obviously not really the same edition.  Photography not as good, lots of \\"short cuts\\" where Eric isn't acknowleged, London Albert Hall isn't acknowleged, it loses all the power that Joe give it by his special insertion of his personality and comments.  Don't know how to encourage people to get the right  \\"version\\" of this DVD but can absolutely confirm how different the two are and how inadequate the 2nd version I received was.  If someone can advise me how to be sure to order the \\"correct\\" version/edition, I am anxious to do so!

1936891026|5.0|The biggest theme that influenced me the most in this book was becoming a professional vs an amateur.  This what this book is about to me.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|As a Spielberg production, this movie is highly manipulative (who wouldn't delight at a quacking goose with a personality disorder), but it's also made with consummate skill.  Even though \\"War Horse\\" is a highly improbable story, it's also magical and miraculous, and that's why we're willing to suspend our disbelief.  Spielberg is also masterful at tugging at our heartstrings -- the setting up of the most emotional scenes, and the pacing of them are done in such a way that even though we're the puppets we can't help but admire the puppet master.
1400064287|5.0|I cannot understate the importance and influence this book as had on me professionally.  It's a 'desk book' for me, meaning I always have it near by on my desk to constantly refer to.  This book is not just about marketing, but also about communication, leadership, and relationships.  If you really value your own ideas and wish to influence your immediate world, personally and professionally, with them... you'll need this book very close by then.
B0059XTUXQ|4.0|There are a lot of reasons why this movie simply does not work.  It jumps back and forth in time without providing a coherent narrative to keep us anchored in one place.  It's a movie about a despicably cruel individual which tries to make her look not so.  It's a movie about the British, and who really cares what happens in Britain anyway?<br /><br />But while there are a lot of reasons why the movie does not work there is one why it does work:  Meryl Streep gives the performance of a lifetime in her portrayal of the Iron Lady.  Whereas she can be extremely annoying and self-righteous when she merely plays her neurotic self (\\"The Hours\\") she is a delight to watch as Margaret Thatcher, catching her tics and idiosyncrasies with remarkable nuance and verve.
B0078JOAOI|4.0|Season two was definitely a little slower than season one...but the character development and dynamics of relationships and power inside the group will take you one a very interesting and entertaining ride.  I love this series because they really do seduce the viewer into watching the next episode - they perfect the teasing endings.  Watching this on Amazon (watched this with a friend who bought the season on Amazon) was amazing and will definitely be purchasing future seasons of shows on Amazon.
B008B1VYP0|3.0|With Adam Levine and Company at the height of their popularity, naming the new album OVEREXPOSED sends mixed signals.  The band realizes that here, at the peak of their fame, they are at their most poppy.  Do they regret it?  Do they embrace it?  Coming off of the heels of the massive hit \\"Moves Like Jagger,\\" Levine has said that the song revitalized the band's career; it gave them a direction.  Now, the band plans to capitalize on that direction with their newest release.  This new creative direction has turned out to be pretty polarizing with fans of the band.<br /><br />The band that wrote [[ASIN:B00006879E SONGS ABOUT JANE]] is barely recognizable here.  The light indie-rock that brought the band into the public eye is gone, replaced with a slick, uptempo version of modern disco.  Levine would even state of the album: \\"It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune.\\"  Not that it is necessarily a bad thing; the production and writing here is so slick and streamlined that all of these songs sound like they could appear on the radio.  The band doesn't feel out of place -- it's a sound that works for them.  There's a ton of influences here: reggae, blues, funk, indie rock, pop, etc... but it's all been covered with a glossy sheen of production.  The biggest issue with this production is that most of the songs sound very similar; and if you aren't thrilled with their new sound, this album will really wear out its welcome. The OVEREXPOSED opens with \\"One More Night\\" (upcoming single), a solid song that sets the tone and mood of the album.  Second track, \\"Payphone,\\" has already received a ton of radioplay, and deservedly so: it's a fun, catchy hit.  \\"Ladykiller\\" is a funky, disco-tinged song that is as catchy as it is littered with falsetto.  OVEREXPOSED feels like the band is having a good time trying out this more mainstream direction, pouring their influences into more conventional formats.  Unfortunately, the album doesn't quite hit the heights of its first half.<br /><br />Fans who were hoping for a continuation of the direction seen in [[ASIN:B005EVVESM HANDS ALL OVER]] are in luck.  However, if you were hoping for a return to the funk-tinged [[ASIN:B000P2A256 IT WON'T BE SOON BEFORE LONG]] or the personal [[ASIN:B00006879E SONGS ABOUT JANE]], chances are you will probably be disappointed with this new record. If you enjoyed last year's massive hit \\"Moves Like Jagger,\\" check this album out.  Highlight tracks to sample/download: \\"Payphone,\\" \\"One More Night,\\" \\"Ladykiller,\\" and \\"Beautiful Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />Additional Release Info:  The deluxe edition of OVEREXPOSED comes with three extra songs, including the excellent cover of Prince's \\"Kiss.\\"  The other two songs are good, but I would only recommend for Maroon 5 fans interested in their new direction.  You can find the deluxe edition here: [[ASIN:B008B1WA4O OVEREXPOSED (Deluxe Version) [Explicit]]].><br />Fans who were hoping for a continuation of the direction seen in [[ASIN:B005EVVESM HANDS ALL OVER]] are in luck.

Highlight tracks to sample/download: \\"Payphone,\\" \\"One More Night,\\" \\"Ladykiller,\\" and \\"Beautiful Goodbye.\\"<br /><br />Additional Release Info:  The deluxe edition of OVEREXPOSED comes with three extra songs, including the excellent cover of Prince's \\"Kiss.\\"  The other two songs are good, but I would only recommend for Maroon 5 fans interested in their new direction.  You can find the deluxe edition here: [[ASIN:B008B1WA4O OVEREXPOSED (Deluxe Version) [Explicit]]].

B005LAII0I|1.0|Did phil collins finance this movie? Seriously, what was Julia Roberts thinking?  Absolute rubbish! This movie is a complete waste of time and money!
B00007LTIA|5.0|My first Yes album was the fantastic Yessongs, another double album that covered a lot of earlier work, and in my opinion was one of their best releases...well, that was until Tales From Topographic Oceans was released and we all learned how serious these guys were about what they put out to the world.<br /><br />I am totally engrossed with this album and look forward to the time when I put it on and float away dragged along by the swirling current of what is to me one of the best pieces of music that progressive rockers Yes have written. One of the best progressive works ever in fact. This music does not work as background filler, it demands that you absorb it with the respect it deserves. I always listen to the entire work and every time it rewards me with more to think about as the journey of Tales unfolds. It is a very visual album to me. Any serious prog rock fans will find it satisfying and wonderous. In my opinion, after listening to Yes music that followed Tales From Topographic Oceans it never really reaches the level of sophistication and dynamics that Tales oozes.<br /><br />1973 sure was a good year for Yes music, two double albums that became the hallmarks for me of what progressive music is all about, it captures the spirit of \\"new\\" music, equalling and surpassing other top bands of the time such as King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Amonn Duul, Tangerine Dream etc etc who are all worthy contenders. I can highly recommend this album/cd to those who are open to an emotional experience that is Tales From Topographic Oceans.

B003JTHWPA|5.0|The disparate lives of five people come together when a gay, deaf man takes a room in a boarding house and befriends them all.  Set in a southern mill town during the 1930's, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, explores the desperation that we all experience when we feel that we are alone in the world.<br /><br />I first read this book when I was in high school, about thirty-three years ago.  Although there were some subtleties that I didn't pick up on (such as the fact that the character John Singer is gay), I was profoundly moved by the lives of each character and the loneliness and hopelessness they all felt.  For a book in which very little happens, the story is gripping.  Every character - from an elderly African-American doctor to a thirteen-year-old white girl - is written with such compassion and insight that I felt that I knew them all intimately.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is heartbreaking, and the end leaves the reader with a sense of hopelessness.  It's a book that stayed with me back when I was fourteen, and a book that continues to live within me all this time later.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I love hidden object games and steampunk so I got this game.  I enjoyed it.  I have two complaints: 1)No pinch and zoom 2) the number of pieces for the objects isn't listed. They're really quite minor when you think about it and didn't take away from the game.  There's a couple mini games within the scenes that I skipped because they gave me fits and I couldn't figure them out.  I've purchased the sequel but haven't played it yet.  I had no problems on my Fire with this game.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The story of Adam Brown is one of the most compelling books I have read in a long time. It brought me joy, laughter, tears and TRUE heartfelt kinship towards him, his whole family, and the Navy Seal Brotherhood!!!<br /><br />It is a book that will move your spirit and soul about a Hero who came from the depths of despair and darkness to the light of Redemption!! Trust me when I say that YOU will be blessed to know Adam Brown after reading his story!! I truly feel like I do!!!<br /><br />Note: This is the first time I have written about a book I have purchased on Amazon and I have liked many!! This is special!!
B00632HWOG|3.0|This is a standard mail app; which was better before the update that included ads.  I use it everyday and have had only minor issues on my Fire:<br />1) Sometimes it takes awhile for an email to load when you open it but I find that if I go back to my inbox and then right back into the email it loads fine.<br /><br />2)I'm not sure if this is the app or my internet but it takes a while to show my emails when I open the app even if I've waited for my Fire 'to warm up'<br /><br />All my folders are there for sorting and all my devices are updated accordingly.  All in all a decent app.
0307730697|5.0|This story is about love, devotion, heroism and self reliance. It's an inspiring story and yet it's hard to read, because the ending is sure to break your heart.<br /><br />The book is very well written and it's a testament to Adam Brown his family and warrior friends. The story of his life has many interesting twist. You can expect an emotional ride with this story--It made me laugh. It made me think. And in the end, it left me in tears (exceedingly rare thing). Yu feel you know this man and his family, and the loss is physically painful, even to a stranger reading this story at home<br /><br />While being a story of a warrior in war, in my mind, the war bits are incidental. They highlight the cost of freedom and the greatness of this warrior and his team mates. But it's far more than a story about heroic Navy SEALs. It's about the man and his journey in life. From the lowest pit of hell to the highest level of achievement, Adam Brown is one amazing man. Even in the Special Operations community, where every warrior is a hero, this man truly stands alone.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine how a lost young man, addicted to crack and on the hard road to prison, managed to turn his life around. It would have been a huge story f success, 'even\\" if he just reformed and moved on to a productive life. But to become a Navy SEAL. To become a wonderful husband and father. To join Seal Team Six. And to do all that while preserving his values and showering love on people close to him--that's just unreal. It's such a great story that folks must read and discuss. We need people as committed, loving and brave as Adam. We need role modes like him. Therefore, the Brown family ought to be very proud, and we ought to be very thankful for men like Adam and his friends.<br /><br />May this great hero rest in peace and his family do as well as he's wish them to. I never knew Adam Brown, but I feel his loss and think of him often. It saddens me to no end that such a man is lost.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I really enjoy Angry Birds and must confess to it being one of the reasons I purchased my Fire!  I've had no problems with it and would totally recommend it.
0375869026|5.0|I loved this book, loved the characters, the story, everything.  August Pullman is a great kid, and is written as a child, not an intellectual giant as children often are in books.  He is sweet, excited and frightened to be starting school, and although sheltered by his loving family, is aware of his differences, but is willing to try to be part of the world.  My heart broke for him at the casual cruelty of those around him and I cheered him on as he did his best to be part of his school and make friends.  Highly recommend.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|What can I say about Angry Birds that hasn't already been said? I am slightly addicted to playing because those darn pigs make me angry when they smile & laugh when I fail.  I've had no problems on my Fire and I can ignore the ads pretty easily.
0142418471|5.0|Fantastic book.  I loved both Will Graysons and both authors portrayed their Will perfectly, if I had to choose between the two....well I couldn't, I changed my mind with every chapter.  All the characters were well written and ejoyable, and of course, my favourite was the fabulous Tiny Cooper, who deserves a book of his own.  I would give just about anything the attend a performance of Tiny Dancer. Highly recommend this book.

B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|let me start of by saying this band ripped off its fans with a thousand suns besides wretches and kings. so i was hoping this would be good, the only good song is lost in the echo. the rest are boringsongs that make no sense, victimized was okay but too dam short to enjoy it. overall this is a uninspired lazy album, and its time to just listen to meteora and relieve the good old days when they werent millionares and cared about every single song instead of making fill in songs, what a shame what this band has turned into and shame on the fans for not holding linkin park accountable for their fill in songs. either make meteora 2 or im done.

0545265355|5.0|So I read all three books over a period of 11 days, and I disagree with most of the reviews.  Personally, I thought the third book, Mockingjay, was far and away the best book.  The Hunger Games was pretty good, but I didn't really like Catching Fire.  I found myself struggling to get through it, but I viewed it as the middle book in a successful series, so I pushed through it nonetheless.  I really thought I was re-reading the first book all over again, and you'll see the similarities immediately.  Some of the plot twists are predictable and you can see what's going to happen almost immediately.  A lot of people have said that the third book goes on and on, but I think it piques the reader's interest and flushes out the story line more.  I can understand how people think the ending is a little rushed, but I didn't think so at all.  The story line isn't happy go lucky, so you can't expect that type of ending.  I spoke with a lot of people who gave me negative feedback on the last book, but I think it was the best book in the series.  You really get an understanding for all of the characters--I found myself relating to a lot of the cast, and there are a few little twists that you don't see coming.  I think this series is very good, but I would suggest you read the books in succession fairly quickly because there are a fair amount details included in the earlier books that are addressed in Mockingjay.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|Can a doctor and an architect find true love in Chicago?  What if these two were separated by time with only a magical mailbox at a lake house their sole means of communicating?<br /><br />This time paradox is a clever way to create a romantic story.  For Dr. Kate Forster who lives in the present, her life has been one long search for love.  Alex Wyler is attempting to recapture his past happiness by buying the lake house on Maple Lake where he grew up.  The lake house was designed and built by his famous father, Simon Wyler, who is very distant and unhappy with Alex's choice of pursuing construction over architecture.<br /><br />The catch here is that Alex is in 2004 and Kate is in 2006.  The lake house is their connection because Kate rented the lake house after Alex moved out, even though to Alex in 2004 the lake house had not been lived in for years when he reads Kate's first message welcoming the new tenant.<br /><br />When you toss in a dog named Jack which serves as a bridge between Kate and Jack, you have a bit of a mystery.  The dog seems more than just a simple canine who brings events about in 2004 and 2006.<br /><br />Sometimes it is a bit confusing knowing for sure what year it is, especially when 2008 is tossed in the paradox near the end of the film.  The 2008 for Kate is to seize her moment of destiny and attempt to alter fate.<br /><br />There two elements or gems which play in the background of this film.  One is the 1946 film Notorious staring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and the second is Jane Austen's Persuasion.<br /><br />Overall this is a unusual film with time and fate paradoxes with romance, soul mates, and destiny rolled into this delightful fairytale. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are excellent as Alex and Kate.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer as Simon Wyler and Dylan Walsh as Morgan, Alex's foil in winning the hand and heart of Kate, are well cast.  You can tell from the beginning that Morgan is definitely the wrong guy for Kate.<br /><br />The only issue that I had with this DVD was the sound quality.  I had to amplify the sound through my receiver to hear the dialogue.  It's very rare that I have to do this.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading book one, I will NOT be reading the other two. 50 Shades of Grey is poorly written, predictable, unrealistic and a disgrace to women. Brilliant marketing has every book club in NA reading this trash. It's amazing that the female author chose to depict a smart, successful young woman as a sex slave just to sell soft porn and advance her own monetary future.  Instead, women of all ages need to be encouraged to believe that they are in the best position to make the right decision for themselves based on their personal value system and not to question this just because of some good looking, self-absorbed guy!
1402566484|5.0|East of Eden is by far John Steinbeck's most ambitious novel, and though his reach may have exceeded his grasp, it still extended farther than he ever had before.  Through a modern retelling of the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck examines the nature of good and evil.  Though his idea of what constitutes the good and the evil isn't too clear---what determines one's moral worth for Steinbeck seems to lie not even just in his relationship to others, but merely in how others *feel* about him---but this doesn't detract too much from the novel, because he is focused mainly on one aspect of the issue, namely the question of whether we are born guilty or are some how guilty by nature.<br /><br />And Steinbeck largely rejects this notion.  East of Eden is, at its core, a repudiation of the doctrine of original sin.<br /><br />But what makes it such a good novel is that these themes are explored through a cast of engaging characters and an engrossing story.  Kate is one of the greatest villains in literature, and by far Steinbeck's best...the chapters about her are absolutely blood-chilling.  Adam Trask and their sons Cal and Aron are fascinating, complex characters.  And the supporting cast is great, particularly Steinbeck's grandfather Samuel Hamilton and the Trask's philosophical Chinese cook, Lee.<br /><br />The story of Adam's blind love of Kate and her heartless manipulation of him and everyone around her for her own ends and the consequences of both, and of their sons' rivalry for the love of their father and its resolution, is a powerfully moving one.  Steinbeck considered this his greatest achievement, saying, \\"It has everything in it I have been able to learn about my craft or profession in all these years,\\" and, \\"I think everything else I have written has been, in a sense, practice for this.\\"  He was right.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.
1594744769|5.0|I love the style of writing that the author, Ransom Riggs, uses. He uses brevity in his word and sentence choices, yet still conveys the entire idea. I really like it.<br /><br />The story itself is unique, and the eerie illustrations pair effectively with the text.<br />I stayed up very late just to read more. That doesn't happen to me often, either.<br /><br />Love it!
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|Meryl Streep is nothing but the TRUTH in this movie! Absolutely BRILLIANT!!

BRAVO MERYL!

B0085776BG|1.0|Red Tails was a completely terrible rendition of an overdone story. The script was horrible, which inevitibly caused the acting (with the exception of Cuba Gooding) to be just horrendous. Lucas should stick with Star Wars. Skip this movie.
B005LAII0I|2.0|Positives:<br />There was some clever contemporary hyperbole, burlesque, asides, wit, allusions and bombastic dialogue/scenes in the script. The costumes, sets and a few green screen effects were industry standard OK except \\"see Problems\\". But relying on great costuming and set design is like putting make-up on a pig - still a pig.<br /><br />Problems;<br />First, miscast. I would have had Katy Perry and Russell Brand (assuming they were talking at that time) for their naturally offbeat improvisational behaviors. Julia Roberts just didn't sell the Queen's role with just her smile (not her fault - bad fit) and any number of others would have been more interesting.<br />Second, the sets, props and costumes seemed too overbearing Hollywood showoffy-plastic like. It's like the director wanted to have the talked-about walk down the red carpet to showcase his talents.<br />Third, the green screen graphics had that borrowed, been done before, fantasy look - not very imaginative. Castle with lengthy elevated roadway on craggy cliff with lake, peasant village and dragon.<br />Fourth, whether it was in the editing, the script or the acting the movie had a roller coaster, disjointed non-flow to it. Lots of intermittent dozing moments.

B001AQR3IU|5.0|This is a great movie! I am not really into romances, but I do love fantasy/adventure movies and this definitely has that. Michelle Pfeifer as a decaying witch, Robert De Niro as a lightning harvester, Ricky Gervais as a seedy salesman, and Claire Danes as a fallen star. If you're familiar with Masterpiece on PBS you'll recognize other faces in the cast too. The story is wonderful, the acting is great, and the sets perfectly enchanting.<br /><br />The \\"Goat Man\\" scenes make me cry with laughter everytime I see it!
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Snow White and the Huntsman is one of those films that leaves you wondering how they managed to get so much brilliantly right, coming so close to being a classic, and yet fall short because of baffling flaws that threaten to sink it like a lead weight.<br /><br />On the brilliant side, you start with the highly ambitious script by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. They flesh out the story of Snow White by not only drawing on the variant versions of the original fairy tale for extra detail but also by adding in background elements to give depth and reality to the world in which it takes place, where reality and magic are inextricably linked and the rise and fall of innocence affect the very land itself. Thus this Snow White is both magical and epic in scale and consequence, far above the simple tale related by the Brothers Grimm.  The characters are themselves equally fleshed out, most particularly the evil queen, who sets a new standard by which all other fairy tale evil queens will hence be measured.  For the first time, the evil queen - Ravenna by name in this case - actually comes with a back story, not only for how she actually became queen but also for why she came to be evil in the first place. You may not sympathize with her, but her behavior becomes much more understandable when you see how she came to where she is at the time of the story. Also brought into greater depth are the Huntsman and the Prince (in this case a duke's son) and the roles they play in Snow White's ultimate fate.<br /><br />And most brilliant of all is Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna. She transforms herself on the screen like the chameleon Ravenna is, going from seeming helpless captive to enchanting beauty to imperious queen, only letting her cold ruthlessness and deadly intensity show through when it suits her purpose. Theron does with a glance or a turn of the head, or even just the way she walks across a room, what lesser actors would take lines of dialogue to convey.<br /><br />Another big plus is the cinematography and the art design, making the settings both realistic and yet fitting backdrops for a fairy tale at the same time. The way the enchanted forest is done here stands as superior to any that I've seen in any other film, truly magical and full of wonder. And then there's their truly original take on the Magic Mirror, an enormous polished-metal disc of the kind actually used back in ancient and early medieval times instead of the silver-backed glass we're familiar with. And the unique way it came to life to answer the Queen's questions was quite well done and add much to the eerie atmosphere that always seemed to surround Theron's Ravenna. A very nice touch indeed. As was the dark and ominous crown Ravenna ends up wearing when she is queen, the design perfectly suited to project a combination of power and ruthless resolve.<br /><br />Of all the things weighing the film down however, Kristen Stewart's Snow White unfortunately tops the list. Part of this - the way the character was written - is admittedly not her fault. The acting however - or rather the lack thereof - is. Stewart's performance belongs to the Keannu Reeves' one-facial-expression-for-the-entire-film school of acting. Worse still, it's the same facial expression she used through the entire Twilight series, as if she wandered off the set for those films and onto the set for this one, stopping only for a costume change. And her limitations become more pronounced as the script demands greater and less plausible things of the character, most particularly Snow White as a fairy tale Joan Of Arc.  This was one of the really hard to swallow even for a fairy tale moments: a princess, who's spent most of her childhood locked away in a tower, is suddenly donning armor and leading a rebel army into battle with sword and shield (but strangely without a helmet) like a war-hardened veteran?<br /><br />Another big problem is in the script itself.  While I appreciate the ambitiousness that really added to the early part of the movie, it becomes clear as the film progresses that a number of things were not really thought through and other things were simply bad ideas. I've already mentioned the strange way in which Snow White inexplicably suddenly morphs - not remotely convincingly - into Snow White: Warrior Princess. The seven dwarves, who were key to the original fairy tale, have been reduced to near irrelevance here. You could in fact cut pretty much all of their scenes and it wouldn't affect the basic plot one bit. While the CGI-enhanced actors do a decent job of bringing the dwarves to life, the problem remains that they really have little to do and end up making parts of the movie drag. Another bad idea comes in the form of the \\"Curse of Twilight\\", i.e. the female hero must have two male counterparts as potential love interests, regardless of how little sense it makes or how awkwardly its handled. The idea to flesh out the Huntsman and the Prince was good, but then taking that and giving them the Twilight treatment really hobbled the movie, particularly as it was not remotely believable. Worse, it was baffling in that it not only messed with the whole fairy tale feel of the story, it led absolutely nowhere and was left like a jarringly unresolved plot thread at the end leaving you wondering what the writers had been thinking. As other reviewers have mentioned, they'd have been far better off going with just combining the characters into one. Add in the fact that Kristen Stewart's one-note Snow White had absolutely no chemistry with either Chris Hemsworth's Hunter or Sam Claflin's Prince William and it just really sucked the air out of a good third of the movie, to the point where you just want Charlize Theron's Ravenna to come back and get things moving once again.<br /><br />Another problem was Bob Hoskins' head dwarf, Muir.  Hoskins, an actor whose work is generally always excellent, is strangely out of sorts here as his eyes never seemed to focus on anyone or anything. I later learned that apparently Muir is supposed to be blind, but the way it was handled in the film this was never made clear. Assuming this to be true however, then this was one of the worst portrayals of a blind person I've ever seen as nothing else about the way he acted or held his head or moved about rang true to the way real blind people I've known do those things.  It was instead simply baffling as Hoskins went through the movie with this inexplicably vacant and unsettling stare. The only possible excuse I can think of is that this was perhaps due to the way that the CGI-dwarfing of his character was handled which may have resulted in the more physical parts of Hoskins' performance being 'lost in translation' as it were.<br /><br />A more niggling problem, for me anyway, was the fact that the Huntsman was always armed with - and only with - a double-bladed war ax and a set of throwing axes.  I'm sorry, but even fairy tale huntsmen don't go hunting with axes.  They use bows, knives and traps. One supposes that they didn't let Hemsworth's Huntsman use a bow because Claflin's Prince was already using a bow, but that also doesn't make sense because the nobility didn't go to war with bows.<br /><br />All of that said though, I still feel Snow White and the Huntsman is worth seeing for the good things it brings to the genre and for Charlize Theron's stand-out performance as Ravenna. Recommended for any fan of retellings of classic fairy tales, of Charlize Theron and for students of why near-great films sometimes end up being pulled down by their flaws.ate the ambitiousness that really added to the early part of the movie, it becomes clear as the film progresses that a number of things were not really thought through and other things were simply bad ideas.

Another bad idea comes in the form of the \\"Curse of Twilight\\", i.e. the female hero must have two male counterparts as potential love interests, regardless of how little sense it makes or how awkwardly its handled. The idea to flesh out the Huntsman and the Prince was good, but then taking that and giving them the Twilight treatment really hobbled the movie, particularly as it was not remotely believable. Worse, it was baffling in that it not only messed with the whole fairy tale feel of the story, it led absolutely nowhere and was left like a jarringly unresolved plot thread at the end leaving you wondering what the writers had been thinking. As other reviewers have mentioned, they'd have been far better off going with just combining the characters into one. Add in the fact that Kristen Stewart's one-note Snow White had absolutely no chemistry with either Chris Hemsworth's Hunter or Sam Claflin's Prince William and it just really sucked the air out of a good third of the movie, to the point where you just want Charlize Theron's Ravenna to come back and get things moving once again.<br /><br />Another problem was Bob Hoskins' head dwarf, Muir.  Hoskins, an actor whose work is generally always excellent, is strangely out of sorts here ashis eyes never seemed to focus on anyone or anything. I later learned that apparently Muir is supposed to be blind, but the way it was handled in the film this was never made clear. Assuming this to be true however, then this was one of the worst portrayals of a blind person I've ever seen as nothing else about the way he acted or held his head or moved about rang true to the way real blind people I've known do those things.  It was instead simply baffling as Hoskins went through the movie with this inexplicably vacant and unsettling stare. The only possible excuse I can think of is that this was perhaps due to the way that the CGI-dwarfing of his character was handled which may have resulted in the more physical parts of Hoskins' performance being 'lost in translation' as it were.<br /><br />A more niggling problem, for me anyway, was the fact that the Huntsman was always armed with - and only with - a double-bladed war ax and a set of throwing axes.  I'm sorry, but even fairy tale huntsmen don't go hunting with axes.  They use bows, knives and traps. One supposes that they didn't let Hemsworth's Huntsman use a bow because Claflin's Prince was already using a bow, but that also doesn't make sense because the nobility didn't go to war with bows.<br /><br />All of that said though, I still feel Snow White and the Huntsman is worth seeing for the good things it brings to the genre and for Charlize Theron's stand-out performance as Ravenna. Recommended for any fan of retellings of classic fairy tales, of Charlize Theron and for students of why near-great films sometimes end up being pulled down by their flaws.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think this game is so much fun. Everybody in my family loves angry birds. I think it would so cool if Rovio created another angry birds where the pigs would take the birds as hostages. The pigs would team up with aliens and the aliens would capture all the birds; including the space angry birds. The one left would be a new superhero bird that would be like superman except its a bird.Which the name of this one would be Revenge of the Pigs. Super Birds birth.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is the first time I have read anything by the author, but was hooked from the beginning of the story. It's such a great concept that as obviously well thought out and researched. My only \\"downside\\" to the story, if you could call it that, was when the story was following three different storylines...but that's just my preference. By the time the story was coming to an end, this was one of the books where I started reading slower so it wouldn't come to an end. When finished, I was left wondering what led to the story, and was happy to see that the author wrote another one similar to a prequel. Needless to say, but that jumped over the other four books already purchased.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|The few days this thing worked the sound was awful. The speed was inconsistent resulting in pitch fluctuation in the files created. Essentially they were useless. After a few days something inside overheated partially melting the back panel. I got return authorization & shipped it back. After the return went through I noticed I was charged a \\"restocking fee\\"...for a malfunctioning piece of junk! I contacted customer service and the fee was returned, but it is ridiculous that I had to take that step and that I was charged a fee in the first place for returning shoddy merchandise.

B0057567P0|3.0|I bought this for my MacBook Pros.<br /><br />1. You have to download the Mac Driver from the Sonnet Website.<br /><br />2. This SUPPORTS BUS POWERED HARD DRIVES - but you have to buy the optional USB-to-DC auxilliary power cable (available at OWC) and attach it to one of the MacBook Pros's USB Ports so you can get 500 mA power on ONE of the USB 3.0 Ports, not both. Thus only one hard drive can be bus powered. 500 mA is enough to power most drives and OWC's Mercury Elite-AL Pro enclosure.<br /><br />3. The Mac OS X Driver has SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. It only supports USB 3.0 hard drives, Sonnet's media reader and Lexar's Compact Flash/SD reader.  The PC Drivers works for any 3.0 peripheral.<br /><br />4. The Mac OS X Driver DOES NOT SUPPORT USB 3.0 HUBS.  They do not show up when plugged in. This means I can't buy 4-port powered USB 3.0 HUBs and run 4 or more external hard drives off of this USB 3.0 adapter. Since NO USB 3.0 external drives allow you to daisy-chain hard drives, this limitation is difficult to accept. It limits the adapter to two external hard drives (one bus powered if you also use up a USB 2.0 port).<br /><br />5. Another serious limitation is that the driver doesn't support USB-connected external displays. Since USB 3.0 external displays for the Mac are coming soon and have much better performance than USB 2.0 external displays, this is a serious limitation for a future desired capability. Certainly, the 2012 MacBook Pro Retina Display with built-in USB 3.0 ports won't have this limitation.<br /><br />6. Since the current driver does not support non-storage USB devices, this means USB 3.0 scanners won't be supported either.
B00006I53S|4.0|This was my default lens on a 40D and still somewhat compelling on a 5D II. On a crop body, it's a portrait telephoto best coupled with an ultrawide, but there's almost no reason to buy it over the 18-135/3.5-5.6 STM. That lens is simply better.<br /><br />The first copies of this lens appeared in 1998. My unit from 2007 doesn't have the zoom creep or poor telephoto quality that earlier reviewers mention. Build quality is average, without the tight production tolerances of recent L or EF-S lenses. The zoom ring is slightly sticky, and at 50mm and wider, there's significant play in the cam mechanism that holds the front elements. Neither seems to great consequence.<br /><br />On a crop body, the optics of this 28-135 are above-average on an objective scale and excellent for this focal range and size class. My copy is sharp across the frame wide open at 135mm and similar to my 100/2 at the same aperture. It's decent wide open at 28mm and very sharp by f/5.6. On a full-frame body, you'll want to have it stopped down to f/8 to keep the borders in the realm of decency. SLR Gear and The Digital Picture show good performance on full-frame, though in my experience, border quality on the 24-105/4L is significantly better at the same aperture. Because of the slow maximum aperture, you may need a flash indoors.<br /><br />Focus is fast, accurate, and consistent past 50mm, even in near-darkness. My copy occasionally misfocuses by small amounts at 28mm, seemingly the result of loose elements in the IS system. Balance is ideal for a 40D/50D and front-heavy on a Rebel body.<br /><br />Video shooters will fare better with the 24-105/4L IS. That one has a smoother zoom ring, constant aperture, and partially parfocal design (i.e., it holds focus when you zoom). The 28-135 is not parfocal. The IS system is first-generation and good for perhaps two stops. It has no panning or tripod detection. Rather than `locking' the scene in place like modern IS implementations, the lens elements slowly drift as if in a pond. Long exposures must have this feature disabled for sharp results.<br /><br />Don't pay $350 for it. This lens was included with many 40D and 50D kits; the used market is crawling with them. Mint copies go for just over $200 on the big auction site. It's a 5-star lens at that price and 4 at retail. With full-frame, the 24-105/4L IS would be better choice, particularly with so many copies under $700 on the secondhand market.owly drift as if in a pond.

0553582038|1.0|Martin's series began with such promise. \\"The American Tolkien\\" the smitten critics and readers trumpeted. Alas, in this volume Martin has turned his once-engaging story-telling into dull and purposeless writing of characters and events of little or no consequence to whatever the overarcing story may be. Here he appears to have completely lost whatever threads of entertwined tales he once held that drove the story, and the reader, into this fantasy.<br /><br />In a \\"Feast for Crows\\" Martin has us follow secondary or tertiary characters at great length through their meanderings, heaping pounds of expositional and irrelevant detail upon us that had me asking myself if he was paid by the word. Frankly, after struggling to wade through this muddled book I'm not so sure that Martin HAS a real story to tell, or is just writing to read his own words.<br /><br />Other reviewers have had more to say on the book. Evaluate their criticism for whatever you may discern. For myself, I will only say \\"enough.\\" I will waste no more time on this authors' work.
0345803485|1.0|I can't wrap my mind around the phenomenon that is Fifty Shades of Grey. I got a third of the way through the first book and felt like my brain was dribbling out my ear--every sentence is poorly written and unbelievable. The characters are obnoxious and one-dimensional. My only conclusion is that it must have been written by and for a sexually inexperienced and socially awkward thirteen year old girl. Don't waste your time or money. Fifty Shades of Grey is an embarrassment and nothing remotely interesting, provoking or erotic.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was one of the most captivating and best books I have ever read.  I am not one to read romance novels nor do I think that this really constitutes as a romance novel however this book gripped me.  The minute I started to read the first book until the end of the third book I couldn't stop reading.  Although it is very descriptive in an explicite manner there is a lot more to this story than just that.  It is a great love story that starts off very dysfunctional and in the end... well you just have to read it.  I love this book and would love to have another trilogy of the same type by this author written or even the same exact trilogy written from Grey's perspective or another characters perspective.  I never read books twice however with this trilogy I decided I want to read it again just to relive the feelings you get when reading this book, I actually was jealous of Ana...  Have fun reading this book and just sit back and enjoy it, don't analyze it or feel guilty for reading some of the explicite parts just enjoy.  One piece of advice, do not read this around your kids, it will feel too weird!  :)
0525478817|3.0|I read this book after hearing several reports from friends to read it. It was well written and had some excellent poignancy. I cannot believe that the characters could be the ages protrayed because most young people, even ones who suffer from illness and pain, do not think as deeply or as articulately as these do. The \\"Fault\\" lies in the author believing them to be far ahead of their time and place.<br /><br />Other than that, the book is great. I teach stories about death and dying and this is a modern representation of an old tale, told with modern lingo and given new packaging which for many will be a first time experience of this sort of story.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|I cant put it down! Usually not my sort of book but the characters are engrosing and the story evolves at a good pace.

B005UBNKZG|4.0|I currently have an HP that uses this processor but I am returning it. Instead I am buying this boxed version and building my own system. It arrived a few days ago damaged. Amazon did not package my processor properly and the side where the processor is was dented and several pins on the processor were bent. Not sure why, but It made me think why does AMD design a nice Tin box, but puts the processor all the way to once side. Why couldn't they have made the cover a little thinner and rested the processor on the top. I understand the window is cool, but I rather have my CPU more protected than being able to see it in the box.<br /><br />With that said, in my HP I love this processor. Factory it seems to rest at 1395MHZ then it boosts up to 3100MHZ under some load. Seems pretty efficient. Windows 7 does use all 8 cores however most games and other applications do not. For example I play a simulator game and when I minimized the screen I noticed Core 1 was at 100% load while the other cores were just twiddling their thumbs not doing much except running other tasks. Which to me means I still have plenty of power.<br /><br />I will update once i receive an Un-damaged processor and complete my build.<br /><br />The reason why I still gave it 4 stars was because even though I mentioned the shipping I experienced with it, this review is about the processor itself. I just wanted to mention my experience with shipping.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|Sophia is a young woman, Wicca practitioner and someone who is trying to find her place in a community were her believes are far from respected.  From quite sometime, she has been hearing some kind of static, but after a ritual the static changes into voices. One night, she goes out with one of her friends and meets Charles, a shapeshifter. From that moment on, everything changes on her life. Little by little he enters her life and becomes an integral part of her, including his secrets. They share love and fight side by side, to confront everything that comes in their direction. Sophia will discover information she ignored about her family and about herself, giving this to her, a new found confidence. She will discover her powers as a witch and her bond with her ancestors.<br /><br />While fighting religious fanatics and a group of a kind of unorthodox vampires , she will make new relationships and will discover how genuine or not are the people who surround her. With determination she will risk everything to save the one she loves.  She will fight against another supernatural force, and these events on her life, will bring a new beginning for her.<br /><br />About the book<br />I received this kindle copy via author Rebecca Hamilton, one day at twitter. On that realm she is known as @inkmuse. When I received my copy, I had already read the sample at Amazon and instantly, this tittle proved to be created with its strong characters as pillars. No doubt, the author takes the time to develop her characters. She gives them strong points, weaknesses, flaws, abilities, even preferences. They are complete in every way. The characters are continuously interacting with their surroundings and how the author describes details, gives you a feel of the setting. It is so that it makes you feel as if you were an active participant in the events.<br /><br />When I began reading, at some points I thought the descriptions were too deep into the character, even excessive, but this grew on me while reading. I also understood how this writing style separates this book from others on its genre. The characters are genuine, they are not superfluous or banal. They show feelings, necessities and have hopes She even created a new kind of paranormal creature in Charles. I applaud this author's effort.<br /><br />Ideas this book deals with:<br />Lack of Tolerance - Sophia has to confront the constant harassment of a person who uses her religious believes to ostracize her on her community.<br /><br />Read this book when you wish to read something about: Paranormal, Vampires, Witches, Paranormal romance<br /><br />What do I think about Sophia? Sophia evolved and that is my favorite thing on a character. Also, I liked that this heroine wasn't naive, she wasn't weak nor was she codependent.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars Overall, I liked this debut novel. They beginning was a little slow and a little bit confusing that's why I took a star away.<br />Source: I received this copy from author at twitter.

068484267X|4.0|McCourt definitely has a way of telling a story.  I enjoy the very lyrical prose (at least in the beginning of the book before it became redundant)of the Irish story teller who told a painful story of childhood that wasn't much of a pain to read, unlike most other sad stories.  I won't reiterate all the strong points that many of the readers have already brought forward but I do want to provide a few different thoughts.  First, perhaps the light humors that were added to the story was a way to balance tragedy and comedy but I, unlike many readers, found some of the humors to be unfitting. Secondly, I'm not sure what the author's message was about the various sexual experiences throughout the book, especially in the final scene.  Were they meant to be humorous or saying something about the desire for freedom from the \\"miserable catholic childhood?\\"  Either way, I didn't laugh and didn't see a connection.  Thirdly, I read the book twice and still couldn't capture the elements that would make this book among the Pulitzer winner list.  I've enjoyed other memoirs just as much, if not better, and they were much less than well known.  Somewhere along the way, maybe because of the movie deal, the book became overrated. A good (not great) read nevertheless.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|I've had this watch for about 7 months now. It replaced my $130 Casio (the crystal broke falling onto the counter top at a height of about 18 inches).<br /><br />What can I say, so far, it's excellent. It is cosmetically very durable. I wear it every day, and I'm kind of clumsy, so I tend to bump into walls and corners with it from time to time. The watch holds up great to every day abuse. No scratches in the crystal, and the large bezel protects the watch well. I haven't dropped it from a large distance, but I expect it's pretty durable internally as well.<br /><br />This watch has a nice \\"classic\\" look to it, even for a young guy like me. With the stainless steel wrist strap, the watch looks good when wearing both casual and professional attire. I wanted a watch that is an all-around wearer, and this watch does the job. Looks almost as nice as my friend's $1500 Omega watch, and holds up just as well cosmetically. It's a bit on the bigger side, so someone with a smaller wrist might not like it.<br /><br />People have commented about the accuracy, and they are right to say it's not a quartz watch. My watch probably loses about 3-4 minutes a week. It takes about 5 seconds to unscrew the bezel, correct it, and put it the bezel back in. Not much of an inconvenience there. That's kind of the novelty to an automatic type watch. I set it 3 or 4 minutes fast every week to try and counteract the drift. Also, I've not worn it for a day or two and it hasn't stopped (unlike my friend's Omega, which does).<br /><br />Very satisfied with this purchase.

B005LAJ22Q|4.0|How did Egg get this roll? Anyway, I wasnt really a fan to start with but box setted season 2 last week, and really annoyed it. I agree, that the plot progression was a little slow \\"Sopheeeah, Sopheeah\\" but you wouldnt want to get too close to any of the major characterers. As people have said, there seems to be a real lack of common purpose to the group as a whole, who are always quick to let their personal niggles get in the way of the not inconsiderable issues of surviving a global pandemic of zombiness. But, we must remember that this is not real, there are no such things as zombies, and this is a TV show. So, we have to allow the writers to compromise between story arc and action, and yes, it is like a soap opera, why shouldnt it be, soap operas are largely character driven, you cant have a tram crash or a terrorist attack in the burbs every couple of weeks, that would be silly. Part of the fun is that it allows us to imagine what we would do in the situation presented, and for me, thats the fun of it.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of cop shows and talent shows, so for some near future PA stuff as good as this to be appearing on my tv, I am generally pretty chuffed. Well done to Egg and the lads and ladies, keep it up!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me preface this review with two statements: One, I usually never take the time to do reviews and secondly, I knew nothing about the content of this trilogy before I read it. A friend recommended it and I thought I would give it a go. Maybe it's because I am a man, but this was, hands down the WORST trilogy I've ever read. The first book actually wasn't bad. I really felt like the author was really setting us up for books II and III and that there would be some great character and plot development that would be flushed out in the second and third books, boy was I wrong. By the time I got half-way through book two, I was so unbelievably annoyed on so many levels. First, the sex was just TOO MUCH. It got to the point where I just began skipping over it because it was the same thing over and over again. Secondly, Anastasia Steele is probably the WORST AND MOST ANNOYING character on the planet. A whiny brat at best, all she did was piss and moan and complain ABOUT EVERYTHING to the point where I wanted to leap into the book and strangle her to put me out of my misery (The most ANNOYING thing was when she discovered she was pregnant in book III and referred to the baby as little \\"blip\\". I wanted to SCREAM every time I saw that word not to mention how many times she \\"scowls\\" at Christian and the emails back and forth, ridiculous). I actually really liked Christian Grey as a character and felt he had so much potential to be this incredibly complex character with a ton of crazy issues BUT the author DID NOTHING WITH HIS CHARACTER! Basically, he was a possessive guy with an insatiable sex drive who just happened to be rich and hot (BORING). Book III was a blur to the point where I just \\"fast forwarded\\" through it so I could finish. The epilogue was pointless. Overall, this was a disappointing read. I really don't understand what ALL OF THE HYPE IS ABOUT. Yeah, there's sex in it, but it's not like it's anything new and do we really need to read 500+ pages of it? It reallyis a shame, this book had so much potential. Don't waste your time...

B005LAIHPE|3.0|Tell me how great this screenplay is, Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) steals a burito to impress a hot girl at a bar, gets arrested,  is forced to join the Navy by his brother (Alexander Skarsgard) and suddenly has an important role on a battleship. I should mention that he's also immature and starts fights while in the Navy. What could be such the thing to shape him up?  Well, an alien attack of course. If he was my only hope during an alien attack, I'd jump overboard.<br />  So, why 3 stars? You still get Liam Neeson as a bad ass once again even if he's not shown enough. While a big soldier with no legs up against an alien in a fist fight, actually made me smile. I also loved the old timers who help out during the attack. Have just them against aliens in a sequel, then sign me up! The film is a great example of a guilty pleasure movie. Movies based on boardgames? I can't wait for Operation with Hugh Laurie trying remove an alien from someone's chest...

B005LAIHY0|4.0|It's really a great movie in terms of asking big questions and answering them. But you will have to think about the movie a long time after you see it to realize what the answers are.<br />My view of the facts of the story is that the Engineers land on an early lifeless earth, probably only one of them and probably by accident.  Faced with the lifeless world he commits suicide with biological self-destruct pills. This is where life including us comes from.  When the engineers take note of us they see us as vermin to be exterminated.  So they developed or deploy this biological weapons system called \\"Alien\\". And when the engineer awakes to find us there he just wants to kill us.<br />The old man who wants the creator to give him eternal life, and the engineer just wants, and makes him dead. This is worth the whole movie for itself. The Archeologist who wants to know what humanity did wrong for its creator to want to kill them off and ignoring that the fact is they probably regard her and her kind has vermin and what humanity did wrong was to evolve in the engineers image. Or maybe we found civilizations that might develop in their technological image. The concept of this sort of view for parents and children and religion is a very interesting statement.  Its things we don't like to see and you get lost in the action of the movie while seeing it and only realize the message when you think about it later.  If the Archeologist does make it to the Engineers home world she will probably not like the reception.<br />From a space opera stand point the way the engineers use biological weapons rather than mechanical ones is interesting and pretty unique.

1466401885|2.0|After reading the book and reading the reviews on here I am quite shocked.  The story aside this book really should not be marketed to young adults.  There are dozens of reviews on here about how \\"hot\\" Travis is and I'm sorry but take a look at him as a person - he is incredibly violent and has serious co-dependency issues.  Try actually living with someone like that and then see if you still think he's \\"hot\\".<br /><br />The story itself (if you can get past the issues I mentioned above) is pretty poor.  Nothing really happens at all except for the co-dependency story line and I really wanted to shake Abby at one point to make her see sense.  I really don't recommend this book, not for young adults or anyone.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|this book is probably the most interesting book ive read in a very long time, it keeps you wanting to know more about the plot, its something we all went through the kinda love that wants to kill and love at the same time awesome book!

B006H8BIIM|5.0|This game is fun. If you are whining about having to make purchases or grind in Survival mode, here's a tip: Get out of Very Easy mode and try it in Hard. Yes, you will get killed but it is much less boring and you earn credits much faster.

B007Y6OZE0|5.0|1. The Future Is Now: 10+/10.  This is an awesome opener.  It's fast, catchy, and the lyrics are intelligent and cynical .<br />2. Secrets from the Underground: 10+/10.  Ditto what I just said.  \\"The Future Is Now\\" blends into this one on the album, so they're really like one song.  Add this to the list of awesome one-two blended combos, along with \\"Have You Ever\\"/\\"Staring at the Sun\\" and \\"Never Gonna Find Me\\"/\\"Lightning Rod.\\"<br />3. Days Go By: 9/10.  This is the first single.  It has wise lyrics, and the tune is awfully reminiscent of Foo Fighters' \\"Times Like These.\\"  It's different from anything the band has done before, but still distinctively The Offspring.<br />4. Turning into You: 9/10.  So it's fair to say this is overall the best first four songs ever on an album from The Offspring.  This one has a cute riff and electronic drums in it, and it sounds a little emo, but in a good way.<br />5. Hurting As One: 7/10.  This is where the album starts to go downhill.  This song sounds a little like one of the filler tracks from \\"Smash,\\" which isn't a bad thing, but it's not a remarkable song.<br />6. Cruising California (Bumpin' in My Trunk): 3/10.  I wasn't sure how to grade this one.  I don't like it because it's a pop song and the lyrics are nauseating.  However, I have to give the band credit for experimenting, and it's still kind of catchy.  It's probably the worst song on the album, but it's still not as unlistenable as \\"When You're in Prison.\\"<br />7. All I Have Left Is You: 7/10.  I like it when The Offspring do deeper, slower songs, and this is one of those.  It sounds a little like \\"Fix You\\" from the last album, but it's more enjoyable.  It's also the longest song they've done since \\"Pay the Man.\\"<br />8. OC Guns: 5/10.  This is another oddball song.  It's kind of catchy I guess, and half of the song makes a point, but the rest is just random Spanish. If they could borrow some of the instrumental ideas here for another song on another album, they might be able to do something with it.<br />9. Dirty Magic: 10/10.  Dirty Magic was an awesome song 20 years ago, and this rerecording definitely breathes new life into it.  It's neither better nor worse than the original, but it's definitely different and shows the band's musical maturity.<br />10. I Wanna Secret Family (With You): 4/10.  This song is good competition for worst on the album.  Lyrically, it's based on a pretty weak premise, and it doesn't do much musically either.  I think this was meant to be a hair metal song.<br />11. Dividing by Zero: 10/10.  Now we're getting back into true punk mode.  This song sounds very old school, and it's a damn good one.  I especially like the \\"Tehran\\"-like introduction.<br />12. Slim Pickens Does the Right Thing and Rides the Bomb to Hell: 9/10.  It's a solid song, but I expect a little more from a closer.  Also, the name is too long.<br /><br />Overall, this album is very diverse, schizophrenic even.  Some of the experiments work well, and some fail pretty badly.  The few songs that stick to the tried and true formula are exceptionally good.  They're the reason I have to give this five stars.  They more than make up for the failures.

1451648537|4.0|I read some of the other reviews, from 5 star to 1 star, and agree with parts of them all.  I started my career as a computer programmer in 1974 in San Francisco and just recently retired. I watched the events in the book unfold before my eyes, and had limited contact with the Jobs teams at NeXT and Pixar.  Given that, I found a lot of light bulbs going off and some sketchy information and assumptions being corrected and filled in.  I like the Apple products a lot (I have 3), but also have a plethora of WinTel products. This is an interesting read, given my context, but there are issues.<br /><br />One review I read thought the author was negative about Jobs.  I thought he was not tough enough, particularly about his habit of taking credit for other folk's work, and his incessant back stabbing.<br /><br />The relationship with Gates is not really fleshed out.  That may be due to the two parties, but it was an immensely long and important one.  This is even more problematic with his relationships with his daughters and the women in his life.  His emotional and spiritual relationships are very sparsely covered.<br /><br />The end of the book was hurried, incomplete, chaotic and unprofessional in my view (Page 525 on).  It started to lose timeline coherence a bit before that.<br /><br />Given all that, I enjoyed thoroughly most of the book and recommend it to anyone who is interested in the history and workings of Apple, and in finding out who the unsung heroes were and are in that company, which I think is the biggest gift from this read.
0143121006|3.0|\\"Midnight in Peking\\" is a decent read. The book is very atmospheric. Almost all of the research regarding the murder comes from the father of the victim's notes. The author seems to have done a lot of other research that was unnecessary, such as describing weather conditions, irrelevant biographies of other \\"characters,\\" and tangential political events happening at the time of the murder. This book easily could be whittled down to a nice article. The author deserves tremendous credit for keeping the myriad of characters readable: whenever he brings up a minor character for a second or third time, he adds a quick tag to remind the reader what that character did previously.<br /><br />I think I approached this book with the impression that I would learn more about Beijing at the time. This expectation was not met, so I was a little disappointed. Although I tended not to like some of the digressions, I did enjoy reading about Beijing's odd mix of foreigners before the war.
1451627289|3.0|If you could go back in time, and save the life of President John F. Kennedy, what would be the result?  That is the premise of Stephen King's November 22, 1963.<br /><br />I am a life-long fan of Mr. King's work, and The Dead Zone remains one of my favorite stories, along with Apt Pupil, The Shining and Pet Cemetery. So, when I learned that he had written a novel about both time travel and the JFK assassination, I couldn't wait.<br /><br />The story moves along well enough, and the notion that the owner of burger joint had found a portal into the past, in Mr. King's capable hands, works. Why not? The most interesting parts of the story, for me, were the implications of time travel, and that the magnitude of a change had a corresponding magnitude in effect. Good stuff, all 'round. One change can send off strings of change along lines that we can't even imagine.<br /><br />This is a story that I think many of us have, directly or indirectly, wanted to see written: JFK does not die in Dallas, there is no Vietnam, tens of thousands of young men do not die in a pointless war, and a \\"better\\" future at least has a chance to evolve. That's the hope, anyway.<br /><br />Mr. King's background research and information is thorough and fascinating, and he weaves it well into his story. Rather than go right to Dealey Plaza, his protagonist changes the past in smaller ways, sometimes with unintended consequences. Much like The Dead Zone, the questions that arise of changing the past or the future are interesting.<br /><br />Saving JFK, though, in November 22, 1963, launches an implausible series of events that lead to, among other things, nuclear war. This does not read like  the kind of cool, direct storytelling that one finds, say, in A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury, where every aspect of the story fits seamlessly together, providing a result that is greater than the sum of its parts. I became dubious at the notion that JFK would have had a close election with Barry Goldwaterin 1964. Having successfully gotten the world safely through the Cuban Missile Crisis AND having survived an assassination attempt, Kennedy might have defeated Goldwater even more badly than he did to LBJ. The notion that the election was close reads forced, as though Mr. King, having saved JFK, had to force a story line to make his point. And the dominos Mr. King knocks over as a result of JFK's survival and second term seemed not particularly considered. Rather, it read to me as though he tried to imagine terrible dystopias and then link them to saving JFK. This read to me like making square pegs fit into round holes.<br /><br />I was not persuaded. And, unlike The Dead Zone, in which Johnny Smith has to question the morality of killing someone who hasn't done anything to warrant being killed, there is no doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald was a vile pest who deserved death. Killing Oswald becomes the only real choice, though other scenarios are briefly contemplated. Again, this kind of artificial construction forces the story along to the predictable wild chase in Dallas to the book depository. Will they make it? Tune in next week...And because the man who saved the Kennedy's life was so articulate in his explanation of thing, because is role was so mysterious, the authorities simply let him disappear. Right.<br /><br />For the detail and history, and even the standard love story, this is not a bad read, especially if you're interested in the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, etc. Mr. King also adds an afterward in which he states that his research suggests that Oswald acted alone. For purposes of the story, Oswald would have to have been the only shooter. I'm not sure he could argue otherwise.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this a bad read at all. At a certain point, though, the story became unrealistically plotted, a forced plotting to make it in an effort to make it all fit.

0446572993|2.0|The first few pages of this latest Baldacci get you thinking you'll have a great read for  the next couple of days, but, alas, such is not to be.  For the purposes of this book, why does the hero have to be an assassin?  It merely seems to supply some \\"who's\\" to the \\"whodunit\\" aspect of the plot.  His behavior throughout, except for the beginning,is totally un-assassin like. He could as easily have been a real-estate agent who'd scammed a few customers.  All of a sudden he gains a conscience, after killing dozens of people he was told were politically or morally undesirable.  So unreal.  The kid who becomes his conscience is unbelievable and so annoying she defies description. The plot, if there is one, doesn't really matter, and the ending leaves almost all of the bad guys in their bad guy places and sails off into the blue with an  \\"oh, well.\\"  I think Baldacci was sleepwalking when he droned this one off. Except for Wambaugh, Sandford, Leonard and perhaps Connelly,  I've had it with the cop novel.  Sure wish McBain and Kaminsky were still around and writing.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I stumbled upon this book looking for novels to put on my new Kindle. The title immediately caught my eye. And the first few pages left me mesmerized and addicted to each word I read.<br /><br />You begin to fall in love with the characters and mystique of the book. Nothing is given away and there are many parts portraying the fate of the two lovers that is to come at the climax of this novel.<br /><br />I'm not going to give anything away; it would ruin the experience for the reader. But the ending, though I wish it would've ended differently is the reason why I loved this novel so much. While reading, I kept thinking \\"What can she possibly do to end this novel when everything is working against them?!\\" But she did and in such a way that I was not disappointed in the fate of Marco and Celia.<br /><br />This book isn't for everyone. Though if you have an open mind, you'll finish the pages in this book feeling a sense of fulfillment (even from the bittersweet ending), a little bit of your heart filling, and a smile planted on your face. Part of me wishes it were longer, but then again, if it were, I wouldn't have loved it as much.<br /><br />Read it. Read it and love it, just like I did. Take it from a picky reader, this one is a page turner.

0345803485|1.0|Found it to be disturbing on so many levels:<br />1) This book is x-rated porn and can be readily purchased by any kid on the street. do we really want our youth getting this kind of material and thinking this is somehow okay behaviour?<br />2) This book seems to work toward Desensitizing people to what otherwise would be seen as brutal acts. Desensitization to perversions lead the perversions closer to the norm until there is not longer a distinguishing line between the two anymore. Think about what happened in the Bill Clinton times. Little 8 year old girls got an unneeded education as to the meaning of \\"oral sex\\". Suddenly statiscis are showing that CHILDREN are performing this act on school buses because it is NOT SEX. We all know, it is indeed sex and can lead to the spread of disease not to mention immorality, but yet, the president said it wasn't so they believe it. I actually had a discussion with my step daughter who was about 8 or 9 at the time and she firmly had decided that her and kids at school excluded oral sex as sex and it was socially acceptable. I am not saying that oral sex is a perversion of course, but I am saying that it is most definitely sex, yet the youth of today will argue otherwise. And I am saying it is a perversion if practiced outside of a commited relationship.<br />3) Degrading women... do I even need to elaborate. The girl in the book had such horribly low self-esteem that she was going to accept beatings, rough sex acts, no touching, no eye contact, no cuddling, no sleeping together, no love. Her mother failed miserably that she would even consider such an arrangement must less struggle with accepting it. It looks amazingly similar to Sharia law doesn't it?<br />4) Biblically sex was created for us as an expression of love, intimacy and enjoyment. This book allows for all of that to be removed, leaving just hard core porn. (In the Muslim world, however, not even close).<br />5) If you have to keep something a secret from the people most important to you in life, then you shouldn't be doing it. Period.  Perverts, pedophiles etc all demand secrecy. Hence Grey's contract. They can't get away with their perversions and abuse to others unless secrecy is granted. Current headlines at Penn State ring a bell?<br />6)I can't see that book as a love story and I know probably that he eventually gives in to experience love, but did we really have to deal with the degradation of women, and brutality of women to get there?<br />7)If they expression \\"OH MY\\" is used one more time and the description of what a gorgeous man he is okay okay , we get it. He is so beautiful it is worth being beaten by him. UGGGHH. WHat has happened to our society.

B005HSL626|2.0|I must be missing something. I downloaded this because of all the good reviews but I just don't see the point. All you do is drag your finger across the screen to slice fruit and try not to slice a bomb. That's it.<br /><br />You do get an ad at the end of each game, but for a free app I didn't find them intrusive. Just click skip and they go away till next time. I also didn't find anything offensive so maybe they removed those or I just didn't play long enough. I also didn't click on any of the ads. I downloaded it July 1 2112. When I turned off my wifi, no ads. My recommendation for parents is before letting your child play turn off wifi and/or use the parental controls on your device.<br /><br />Two stars because it worked well on my Fire but it really has no substance. Very young children might like it.

0553386794|5.0|It is without reservation that I say \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the best book I've read in a long, long time. With a sweeping scale and wonderfully paced drama of every kind, Martin spins a tale unlike any the genre has ever seen. The characters in particular make the words fly off the page and into a reader's soul. Tyrion is one of the best characters in literature with his evil and lovable nature. Cersei is horrendous, Ned Stark is admirable but flawed. Defying the archetype, Martin paints each one of characters grey rather than black or white--this is so much different than most white cloak vs. black cloak stories.<br /><br />As well as a crackling read, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a great study of the world that we--that is to say me and you--live in today. The struggle for the Iron Throne can easily be compared the US elections and also elections around the world. Though not nearly as allegorical as Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" Martin's first piece in the Song of Ice and Fire certainly lends itself to allegorical comparisons.<br /><br />Blending so many elements into one unique, chilling story, Martin demonstrates time and time again his mastery of the English language. With fun comparison, laugh-out-load similes, and perfectly placed foreshadowing, this book can easily be taught at the college level to great success--particularly to non-English lovers.<br /><br />Whether you generally like or dislike fantasy should be irrelevant when picking this book up. The story is timeless but not cliche, the characters are fabulous but not immortal, and the book as whole is a treasure that shines with the brilliance of coal. I assure you that you will understand exactly what that last part means when you finish the book. \\"
1466401885|3.0|Amazon recommended this book if you happened to like 50 Shades of Grey. It did not have any crazy sex scenes, but it was okay. Sometime the author jumped around a little bit, but it wasn't to bad of a book. I didn't regret buying it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game drives me crazy. I love it!! it is a great way to pass the time when u have to wait.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray version.  If you're purchasing this movie on Blu-ray, chances are that you've already seen it and love it as much as I do.  The movie itself gets a 6/5 from me!  Imaginative, captivating, and amazing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer of Labyrinth is, surprisingly, much better than I thought.  The 1080p picture quality is AMAZING.  The goblins' faces, the glistening walls of the labyrinth, Ludo's fur...you just want to reach out and touch!  Even the CGI owl in the opening credits looks incredible.  Kudos to Sony for putting such effort to make this film look as great as it can.<br /><br />The sound, however, is where the Blu-ray comes up short.  While not terrible by any means, I have to say that the Superbit DVD version far and away beats the Blu-ray.  The mixing is all sorts of unbalanced here, and it creates some pretty jarring moments.  Specifically, the background music is way too soft throughout the entire film.  This is unfortunate, as Trevor Jones' score is immaculate. However, it's downright tragic during the musical sequences of the film.  While the background music is low, the vocals are overly loud (even louder than the dialog).  The \\"Chilly Down\\" part is almost unlistenable.  There's also one part where Hoggle's lines have been overdubbed (in the oubliette, \\"Well, can't be right all the time\\" is arbitrarily changed to \\"Can't be right all the time, can we?\\" in what sounds like a different voice).  Also, the 5.1 surround mix isn't as \\"surrounding\\" as it can be.  On the DVD, when Ludo calls the rocks, his howls begin in the front speakers and gradually move to the rear.  This doesn't happen on the Blu-ray, and it's a shame.<br /><br />Mixed bag on this release.  Stunning (and I do mean STUNNING) picture quality, sub-par sound mixing.

B000UYJR7I|2.0|this movie was horrible. i'm talking absolute dog crap awful. i wish i would have just stopped watching when i realized it was really but kept going just to finish it.<br /><br />more about style than substance. poorly executed. the story could be okay, but the acting, directing, editing were all crap. such horrible acting by justin timberlake; haha!<br /><br />christina ricci was smokin hot though. distractingly so. i think the producers realized this would be the only redeeming quality early on, and they featured it quite heavily.<br /><br />also, samuel l. jackson is always a cool mothersucker; so that was good. and the music is pretty good throughout.

B006RUJST6|5.0|...and it's sequel. I am very picky when it comes to YA books because they are all about insecure girls who fall in love (or should I say become obsessed with) some hot unattainable guy. So I was wary when I saw the high ratings for this book, but since so many people really liked it, I figured I'd give it a try. I stayed up all night reading both books in the series, and then took a short nap and read them again. I just loved all the characters and their intertwining relationships. I wish Mrs. Hoover would write a new book from the perspective of each character every month (okay, I'll settle for  bi-monthly. Her family needs to get their laundry washed at some point). So trust me, buy it, read it, and you won't be able to put it down.
0553801503|5.0|I've read some of the reviews for \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and I understand how some of the readers gave the book three or four stars. If I were to wait five years for this book and not have a few major characters from the previous books I'd be pissed too. Now I know that three or four stars isn't necessarily a bad rating, but I truly believe that the book deserves better than that.<br /><br />I started reading the series about two months ago, so characters like Tyrion, Stannis or Danny are fresh in my mind, so I didn't have to wait a decade to find out what they were doing. I guess what I'm am trying to say is that the series is best read when Martin had about five of the books written. He's just a very methodical writer which attests to his success.<br /><br />I liked the new characters and their conquest for power. The new characters play the game of thrones just like all the other lords and kings from the other books. Each character had his or her own technique for conquest. I feel that is a part of what makes \\"A Feast for Crows\\"  more different from the other three books.

B004EF6632|5.0|Thank you, BBC, for creating such a wonderful adaptation of North and South! I fell in love with the book right after reading it- and then was skeptical if the film could live up to my expectations. But I think the movie was so well done- the character so well cast, the romance and the drama so deeply felt, that it improved on the book and has made this period film one of my favorite of all time. The story is not just romance- it is about character, principle, about making sacrifices to do the right thing, and is about what it means to be a truly worthy, and noble human being. Mostly, it is about love- with the strongest message being, that in a place where there is no love or sympathy for another human being, it is like the death of the human soul.  One of my favorite lines- at the end of episode one in Margaret's letter to Edith- after she has made a visit to the Miserable white-filled toxic, cotton-infested factory: \\"I believe that G-d has forsaken Milton. I think I have seen hell, and it is White, Snow White.\\" The mention of G-d and hell in reference to the working conditions also help underline the central question of faith in the book, and seem to suggest that faith is less about following a doctrine than it is about moral character. Superb filmmaking- a must see!

0345803485|1.0|What a waste of time and $7.99!!! E.L. James is, by far, one of the poorest writers of all time! The plagiarism and severe lack of creativity is astounding. Taken from fan fiction and a blatant attempt to try and model Christian Grey after Bret Easton Ellis' Patrick Bateman in \\"American Psycho.\\"<br /><br />James manages to be irritatingly redundant and inconsistent all in one. And, I seriously suspect that she is unaware of what the simplest words in the English language mean. How many times can this woman write that \\"he murmured,\\" \\"I murmured,\\" \\"he gaped,\\" \\"his mouth fell open, gaping?!\\" Obviously James does not know what the word \\"murmur\\" means and couldn't find any other way to describe when some one is speaking. But then, to prove that she has some sort of writing skill, the author throws in a \\"big word\\" here and there that makes me suspect that she sat with a thesaurus. The main character is a lit major, which is ironic since the author lacks the ability to grasp the written word.<br /><br />She manages to be inconsistent in the fact that she writes about 21-year-old girls who were born and raised in the U.S., yet they use British terminology, love British tea and literature and all other things British. The characters say things such as; \\"I'll have a go at it,\\" \\"bloody right\\" and \\"I'm not keen on the idea.\\" What young, American girl talks like that? Why not have them live in England if you are going to make your characters seem British? (This is not a dig at England, my entire family is from \\"across the pond\\").<br /><br />James, do I sense that you went on Wikipedia to learn more about the BDSM world when you couldn't take from what the fans wrote on the Twilight website? Not at all shocking nor racy, but again, redundant.<br /><br />Lastly, how transparent could the writing be? It's called Fifty Shades of Grey and the color in the title is definitely the running theme. Really?! You named them Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. So if they marry, she is Mrs.Steele-Grey?! The whole \\"grey thing\\" was laid on pretty thick. Also, who cares about these two idiotic characters?! Ms. Steele is basically a schizophrenic anorexic (One more word about her weirdo subconscious and I would have burned the book). And, Mr. Grey is your typical survivor of child abuse that did not go to therapy until it was too late and his issues were internalized. He is a stalker (which is actually not attractive) and he is abusive (NOT because he likes and performs BDSM).<br /><br />I was just hoping and waiting that the next time he took that airhead into his ridiculously named dungeon, he would bring out a chainsaw and cut her into pieces and then be revealed as a serial killer. That is the ONLY way this book could have redeemed itself.<br /><br />Shame on you, E.L. James, for this copycat, poor-excuse-for-literature-and-erotica piece of crap. Way to go for fooling those whom have never been exposed to BDSM and know very little about people who have been adopted (me included in being adopted) into believing that is how it really is. By making Grey adopted, you send a poor message that those of us who were adopted are f-ed up and don't feel we belong in our families. And, by your clear lack of knowledge of BDSM, you truly mislead readers further.<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE OR THE REST OF THE SERIES!!!
B007PVHANM|5.0|One of the most exhaustively-researched biographical docus I've ever seen, and nary a moment of its two-plus-hour runtime is wasted. Packed with honest, revealing, enlightening face-to-face chats with every major player in Bob Marley's story, this candid tell-all effectively captures the social impact of his work on-stage and in-studio, along with the intimate details of his private life. It doesn't take much prodding to realize that before we can fully comprehend one, we must also understand the other. Dedicated apostles of the icon should welcome the personal insights, while more passive appreciators are bound to be staggered by the power of his voice on multiple levels - musical, political, religious and intellectual. Warm, complex and genuine, just like its subject - I can appreciate his work on a whole new level today.
0805095535|4.0|My first introduction to the works of Paul Auster occurred a couple of decades ago when I read [[ASIN:1423395808 The New York Trilogy]]. Edgy, psychological examinations of one's inner being, and the ghosts that haunt us. And it seemed that the only fitting setting for this novel, as well as some others, is New York City, a town he knows so well. I've also read other novels, including [[ASIN:0670825093 Moon Palace]] twice, which I've reviewed.  He is in that small sub-set of American authors and artists who have developed a strong following in France, promoted in part by that wonderful publisher, Actes Sud, based in Arles. In some cases, their renown is initially stronger in France, and then it resonates back to their home country. I'm not sure this was true in Auster's case, but his devoted coterie of French followers certainly helped his worldwide reputation, and pushed me to read his works. When Vine offered this work, with the title that clearly denoted a \\"summing up,\\" I had to say: \\"Yes, please.\\" And when the book tells me his father passes on, in joyful circumstances, at the age of 66, one can appreciate the appropriateness of the timing.<br /><br />We're coevals, so he draws you in with the inevitable impact of the aging process. There was the car wreck, caused by taking that one small gamble so he could arrive home quicker to attend to that urgent matter of the bladder, yet he was always such a \\"safe driver.\\" There are the pains in the legs... and then he is off, on a warm, self-deprecating reflection of his childhood. Like many a family, there were dollops of the dysfunctional in his, including the divorce of his parents. There are not many glimmers of insight into his novels, but I thought this was one: the distant or non-existent father, as depicted in [[ASIN:0670825093 Moon Palace]] was, very much, a reflection of his own circumstances. The death of his mother is rendered poignantly, as is the exasperation with the in-laws who deem this a suitable time to critique the deficiencies of her life. There is also schooling, the obsession with baseball, that yields to an even more compelling obsession, around the age of 13. Part of the memoir is a chronology of the numerous places that he has lived (how many of us could do that, I know I couldn't). Vermont provides a much needed counterpoint to the life of the City. In Paris, with a vociferously complaining neighbor, Auster says he had to pull the \\"Jew card\\" on her (they were both Jewish, so why are we fighting?) It worked! And I thought why is it not possible to do the same with the \\"human card\\"? His relationship with first girlfriend / wife seemed to be reflected in the words of an old Leonard Cohen song: \\"I need you, I don't need you, I need you, I don't need you, and all of that jivin' around.\\" His second marriage was \\"for keeps,\\" to a woman from the Minnesota heartland, and this time I thought of a scene from (Annie Hall) though it was Wisconsin in Woody's case. It's all good stuff, authentically rendered. I even thought he drew three cards to fill an inside straight when he found a poet, who could render Baudelaire, on the rue St. Denis, a most unlikely place.<br /><br />We've led very different lives, but if the line is long enough, there seem to be those intersections: like first arriving in Paris, in '71, within six weeks of each other, and even, regrettably, wanting to punch out one of those laws unto themselves, a Parisian cab driver.<br /><br />I do have a quibble, and maybe more. For 10 pages, Auster recounts ONE movie plot, \\"D.O.A.,\\" as it relates to his mother's death. It just didn't work for me. Likewise, the list involving James Joyce. But the central problem was the omission of the \\"elephant in the room.\\" It's fine, even most appropriate to speak of the piano-tuner in Paris, who, when asked what happened to the Jews of this arrondissement, said: \\"Oh, they went off.\\"  Like on a cruise, Auster retorts mentally. And he feels compelled to visit Bergen-Belsen, with the sign: \\"Here lie the bodies of 50,000 Russian soldiers.\\"  \\"The earth was screaming,\\" Auster feels. It is good to know your history, and both events occurred before his lifetime. But what of the events of his lifetime, that \\"elephant,\\" the 3 million dead in Vietnam, (\\"the forest of screaming souls\\"), the 2 million dead in the auto-holocaust in Cambodia, and yes, the 58,000 plus on the polished black wall in DC? It didn't even merit a footnote. A gapping lacuna indeed, for someone who lived through those times, and, at some level, should have been affected. Subject matter for a more fruitful conversation with that piano-tuner.  4-stars., with the sign: \\"Here lie the bodies of 50,000 Russian soldiers.\\"  \\"The earth was screaming,\\" Auster feels. It is good to know your history, and both events occurred before his lifetime. But what of the events of his lifetime, that \\"elephant,\\" the 3 million dead in Vietnam, (\\"the forest of screaming souls\\"), the 2 million dead in the auto-holocaust in Cambodia, and yes, the 58,000 plus on the polished black wall in DC?

B0050DIWFC|2.0|The basic story in this book is quite good. A murder, two suspects one of whom is the ADA's son, a trial, a verdict and a conclusion. However, my greatest complaint was all the unnecessary descriptions of people and places. I found myself speed reading my way thru about 1/3 of the book.<br />I must say the last Chapter was the best of all. Would I recommend anyone paying more that $4.00 for this Kindle Book. NO. Nor would I read any more of this author's work.
B007P3TMW2|1.0|It's hard to give a bad review to something related to the tragedy of 9/11, but I won't be recommending this movie to anyone.
B007L96VCY|5.0|I had this record when it came out.<br />At that time I liked it ok, but it<br />was not up to what the Beatles had<br />done as a whole. Today I like it<br />much more, possibly due to the<br />sound quality and the fact that it<br />has stood the test of time. Compared<br />to what's coming out today it's a great<br />album. The sound quality is excellent.<br />The packaging states that this title was<br />remastered but to me it sounds like it<br />had been remixed also. If only the<br />remastered Beatles that came out a few<br />years ago were this good. I got the<br />remastered Sgt.Pepper and compared it<br />to my 1987 release that was pressed in<br />W.Germany and it was a slightly better.<br />The identical tracks from Sgt.Pepper that<br />were included in the Yellow Submarine Song-<br />track cd blows away the remasterd Sgt Pepper<br />by a large degree. IMO.<br />Elliot Burstein
B00004ZAZZ|5.0|I already had the original  Oops!... I Did It Again album. As a Britney Spears collector, i had to buy the special edition of Oops!... I Did It Again. I can honestly say i enjoyed every track on this album. A few of my favorites are \\"Lucky\\", \\"Stronger\\", \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\", \\"Satisfaction\\", and \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\". I Also liked that the album came with one of my favorite Britney music videos, Lucky. For any pop fans, Oops!...I Did It Again is a must have. For any Britney fan, The Special Edition is a must have.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|first time playing and already addicted!!  fun fun fun!!!  I will never put my kindle down now.  thanks a lot!
B0006284JQ|5.0|If you like pop music, you will love Britney's greatest hits. This Cd has something to offer to everyone. From the club-like fun tracks like Toxic, My Prerogative, and I'm a Slave 4 U to the songs with deep meaning such as Everytime, Lucky, Stronger, and Overprotected to the Early Britney bubblegum pop tracks such as Oops!... I Did It Again and Baby One More Time. These songs all have very relatable meanings and each are put into a brilliant pop song. Even if you don't like Britney, You'll love her greatest hits. If you like pop music, then this is a must have. You haven't heard the best of pop until you've heard every song on this album.
1466401885|3.0|OMG!!! I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I decided to read this novel. Of all the books to choose for a summer read. I got so emotionally caught up with this novel that by the end of it I felt as if I needed a drink.<br />In the real world every girl in their \\"right\\" mind would know to stay away from a guy like Travis. But in my fiction fantasy world I could understand the appeal. You couldn't help but feel for him as annoyingly whiny as he was. At most he's aware of his issues and then some. And for whatever reason you know that Abby or \\"Pigeon\\" as she's affectionately called, was truly the only person to really get him. The Ying to his dysfunctional Yang. Now this all took place within the space of one school year. I was left totally unsatisfied with the ending as it felt a bit rushed. But I was somehow relieved that it ended on a somewhat UP note. I don't know if that was necessarily a positive thing, Gawd knows these kids need therapy( but somehow I don't think the author's intent was to be philosophical about their relationship, TAKE IT FOR WHAT IS). I'd like to think that at some point when they graduated, with all that fighting and the raging hormones etc, that's been going on, at some point they tire of each other. That would not be cute when they're say, 40 years old. Geeezus H. Kriste!
B00783NWB6|4.0|If you follow the  Underworld series, then this one is well worth watching. 3D is just OK no real exciting 3D effects.
B0085A9HXS|2.0|Synopsis: a group of SWAT-like cops in Indonesia go into a multistoried tenement in order to capture a drug lord, living near the top floor. The drug lord is played by veteran actor Ray Sahetapy, nowadays looking nothing like his former handsome self. The building has more criminals living there than an American HUD housing project. A third of the way up, surprise is lost. The drug lord, who has cameras and speakers in every floor, invites everyone to take out the intruders whereupon a slaughter begins with automatic weapons, knives, machetes, etc. The cops are rapidly eliminated except for a handful, who cannot call for backup and who run out of ammunition, at which point it's martial arts time, as they try to extricate themselves out of the trap. The violence is nonstop. There is little characterization and the film is just a vehicle for martial arts. I have to admit that most of the fights are pretty stimulating and somewhat believable. Until near the end, there is one long, long, long, LONG scene where nonstop assaults take place (I went out for popcorn, bored, came back, and it was still going on). After sustaining all this damage, the protagonists just simply walk out of the room.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that it was filmed with the technical expertise that Indonesian film industry usually lacks (although they have some very good, overlooked, actors and actresses), mainly due to the writer/director being Gareth Evans, I really don't see why it had so many good reviews in the US. Oh, well.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This album is both...growth, they've expanded, learned, cultivated their sound into something that is very Linkin Park but slightly re-tooled. And a rebirth because it has the amplitude, the early albums had...hard driving beats, thought provoking lyrics. Each song delivers to make this a solid album, I'm quite happy! Hope you dig it and look up the lyrics, it adds to the enjoyment ten-fold.
B007857FOO|4.0|I love the collectible fabric wedding poster. It is big and lovely. I was expecting the DVD cover to be like the one we see in the picture. But in reality the wedding dress edition is just a box and inside its the normal breaking dawn DVD with the fabric poster of Edward and Bella. So I was disappointed, i really wanted the DVD case to be the wedding dress. Overall love the movie, the poster, just wish the Dvd case was like the box in came in.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is easy to use and smart. The way it's organised is really easy. I have no trouble using this app.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|The in game purchase is fine and dandy, but the rate you earn credits to purchase must have upgrades is a joke.  In game purchase to speed that along is nice to have... But when you make it practically a requirement it's sad.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome. But it takes a long time to load and when you collect the coins,  it also takes a long time.But over all it is really awesome.

B006GKHE6G|5.0|This game is amazing, steering works great and graphics are rediculously awesome. This makes asphalt 6 look like a baby game. I got this for  $1.00, but it's definately worth paying $2.00 for.

1469984202|5.0|Wool is a book that I really wanted to finish.  Several times I found myself distracted when I couldn't finish reading the story.  Looking beyond genres, this is good fiction.
030758836X|5.0|I really LOVED this book - through and through until about the last 20 pages.  I don't want to spoil it for others, but I think the ending just killed it a bit for me.  Overall I think it was an excellent story - very compelling, current and interesting.  I will definately recommend it to others!
B005LAIH5O|5.0|Really enjoyed this one as much as the first one. Definitely worth watching and even the kids can watch it with you. I watched it twice in a row. I really enjoy these types of movies and have seen the original at least 30 times growing up.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|If you go into this not expecting this to be like \\"Alive\\" or other survival flicks then you won't be upset at the end.  I thought it was realistic and touching at some points.  Had to watch it twice to appreciate this movie for what it is. When I watched it the first time I was expecting more action and more fights with the wolves.  The second time (about 2 months later) I watched it and just let it be with no crazy hype from the commercials.  I think people were expecting Liam Neeson to kick some wolf tale but that wasn't in the script.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|Wasn't expecting to like this book as I had read some negative reviews so I was surprised I enjoyed it. At times it was a bit slow but generally I was entertained, I could relate to her on some levels.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It sounded nice to have all 6 movies in one blu-ray set ... then I found out they changed things.<br /><br />No sale George. I was willing, albeit grudgingly, to accept that the changes in the theatrical re-release were the movies now, as long as the original was an extra on the disks (insert grumble about anakin's face here). Just adding darth yelling 'no!!!!!' before the emperor's swan song now though was enough to ruin what integrity the film had left. Enjoy losing the sale.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book was probably the best fiction book written around the topic of greek mythology ever. It keeps the kids entertained with the whole &#34;quest&#34; aspect, and provides a lot of information into the mythology of greece as well. Im fourteen, and i still think this series has some sick $wagg.  (That means its good for all the parents out there). I know that Harry Potter and this book have similarities, but both were good due to the fact that they were easy to get into. This book comes from a whole different point of view than the HP books and are a lot shorter for the wimpy readers out there. Nice job Rick Riordan, and thank you JK Rowling for writing a good series also.<br />dalTex@sR3v!ew$™
B0079XPUOW|3.0|Mr. Scalzi is a terrific author, one who would probably have been right at home in the golden age of sci-fi even while pushing the envelope just as the masters did.  In his latest, \\"Redshirts\\", it seems at first to be a rather lazy spoof of Star Trekian TV plots.  Frankly, I found it to be a bit of a chore to get past this part of the book.  Once done, however, a far more interesting story presented itself, about which I cannot say more except that it was more grounded in a familiar reality. I understand the need for the first section, but cannot help saying it did not measure up to the rest of the book, which was well done and thought-provoking.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is just overall AWESOME! Most games that are village based you have to buy an expansion pack or money, this one doesn't have anything like that!! :)

B006OCM0G0|1.0|okay, I've been playing this game for about five seconds, and already I want to uninstall it because I immediatley saw what it's REALLY ABOUT. if you have played Monster Park, you will find this is exactly the same concept. don't have enough gems to make food instantly when you could wait FIVE GODDAMN MINUTES? oh you can buy like five for an unreasonable price, and you'll instantly blow them. its an endless cycle of heartless app designers using innocent little kids as a way to steal money from their parents. DO NOT BUY!!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great novel.  I enjoyed every page from the first to the last.  I thought I could predict the ending; however, I was wrong. I can't wait for Kathleen Grissom's next novel. The great novels that I have read, stay with me.  This is one of those novels. BRAVO!
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I love this game. It has a very Red Alert or Star Craft feeling. Love that. I am getting worried that I have to spend real money to continue to play. I won't spend a penny on it just write a poor review.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is a lot in this book that could have used the finely sharpened blade of a take no prisoners editor. All of the repetitive phrasing including hot, super hot, holy **** (fill in the 4 letter word), Jeez, Ana's utter inner goddess-ness, the gasping, peeking, muttering, whispering, and biting of the lower lip would have been excised by even the most inexperienced of high school English teachers (or their teaching assistants, for that matter). Really - find another way to say it or DON'T SAY IT is what my AP English teacher would have yelled at me. That would have left the sex, which is not bad but becomes almost comically repetitive (a la the Penthouse Forum's \\"I never thought it would happen to me....\\" standard opening lines).<br /><br />I make it a point to get to the end of (almost) any book that I pick up, but I find myself skipping forward in this one and frankly waiting for it to end (and not in a good way). I usually want to know \\"Who dunnit?\\" but in this case I am hoping for Ana & Christian to simply STOP DOING IT. I am actually reading some other Kindle Singles just to take the edge off! I rarely if ever read more than one book at a time, preferring to get immersed in my stories and lost in the fantasy that they represent. I also don't usually read romance or erotica (preferring to get mine in person, thank you very much....) but was hoping for an infusion of both in this book. I don't believe I will go on to the next book because I don't want to contribute to the pocketbook of the writer.<br /><br />Sigh - I was really hoping that this would live up to the hype but the hysteria of the modern media machine won me over. And I will only go to see the movie if it stars Ryan Gosling - now THAT would make even me repeatedly blush, mutter, get all warm \\"down there\\" and yes, bite my lower lip to the point I would probably bleed :-)
0194325385|5.0|Very useful for English learners and detailed as every Oxford book. A must have for everybody who like to study English.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I believe this translation to be in error in at least one passage I have found; Genesis 6. In this translation it States that the sons of God procreated with the daughters of humans. I must first assume since it makes a distinction here between human and non-human that these sons of God are angles or aliens. I do not believe in aliens so we will explore the former. During a study of this passage and a subsequent study of angels I have found that the Bible States that in heaven there is no giving or taking in marriage because we will all be the bride of Christ. In addition the Bible also States that angles are neither male nor female. Neither are they brides of Christ. They were created to be servents, ministers and messengers. Essencially they are the army and lackies of God. However, getting back to the point; if they are sexless then they would have to procreate in the same manner that God himself did with Mary, by &quot;Overshadowing&quot;. If this is the case then each of theism children would have had miraculoous births and each could have became a Christ. however we know that didn't happen. God dose not allow sec outside of marrage. Therefore, for an angle to have done this would have been sin. We can then look at the sinful angels, or fallen angels. They have power, but not the power of God nor does God bless them. Therefore, I believe it safe to say that God did not allow them to &quot;Overshadow&quot; any women. Remember, the gates of hell are still locked until judgement day. The fallen angels are still here on earth. Why then do ee not see these giants and powerful men today. Did the fallen angels finely decide to follpw the rules? Lastly, if indeed the fallen angels did procreate and create giants and increadily powerful people, then how can the anakites and Goliath be explained after the flood? The Anakites were listed in the geonology of the Jews. Did God now decide sec outside of marrage was a good thing only then to turn around and declare again thatit was not?
B0020TS5LK|1.0|This is a review for the Alliance Blu-ray release.  DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!!  This is some weird French version.  I've been waiting for Blade and Blade 2 for years so I was happy when I saw this come out.  But when I put the disc in my player it goes straight to the movie.  There are no menus on this disc.  Not even a chapter list.  The disc has no subtitles.  The picture quality in the first 5 minutes or so is horrible.  It gets better later but still not up to the standards set by most BD's.  The audio quality is complete crap also.  The lossless track sounded no better than the Dolby Digital version.<br /><br />And the worst thing?  The picture is just a zoomed in version of a 4:3 presentation so you're missing a lot of image on the right and left sides.  What a pile of crap.  I had pre-ordered Blade 2 but once I saw this one I immediately cancelled my pre-order.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a better US release in the future.  This one sucks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is okay but it takes forever to get points to enjoy the game. I advice everybody between the ages of eight and fourteen.
B004QL7K8E|3.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />Behold my reaction to the first scene of Project X: `Geez, not another one!' Seriously, for last few weeks we've only had reviews for movies with `found footage'. As much as I'm starting really, REALLY despise the technique, it was actually used in a quite well, in that it was used in an exciting way, and somewhat believable that someone could be filming a party. The movie only features no name actors and they do a decent job, however, for me, the star of the film is the editing and the soundtrack. It made you feel like you were there experiencing the sights and sounds of the party (whether you find it pleasant or not). The ending, and in particular, the moral or message of the film was downright atrocious, but if you overlook that and are looking for a laugh, then this might appease you, cause just when you think it couldn't get any worse, somehow it always did.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />T-Rick arrives at the party all guns blazing, sending a neighbour into chaos.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Some of the footage was shot by the cast with cell phones, Flip, iPhone and Blackberry phones that were handed out by the crew. Over 10 hours of footage was recorded mostly due to the cast continuously recording.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought that it was pretty cool but it can get a little expensive sometimes. some of the games were really tough to beat but otherwise it was fun.
B000MKXEME|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Mad medical student Herbert West develops a formula that can re-animate dead tissue. When he introduces his rather hesitant fellow student Dan Cain to his crazy experiments, the two set about trying to prove that death is not the end...although soon enough they'll wish it was.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />In a decade when horror was all about mask wearing stabby mongoloids along came Gordon's brilliant `Re-Animator' which blends comedy with gross-out horror so intelligently that you'll laugh yourself sick. Based on H.P Lovecraft's story, `Re-Animator' may seem tame compared to today's standards but back in 1985 it was released unrated; substantial cuts made sure it went through without an X-rating...sigh. At no point does this film feel like a low budget B-movie, this is accomplished through Gordon's excellent direction. This gives `Re-Animator' a Hitchcock feel mixed with a fun Frankenstein story and some incredible special effects, which triumph the CGI stuff that modern horror is inundated with today. On top of this there is quality acting, Abbott and Crampton are likeable innocent victims caught up in West's madness, Gale is cleverly conceited as the pompous perverted Dr. Carl Hill, but it is Jeffrey Comb's mad scientist Herbert West that went on to become one of the most memorable characters in horror history. `Re-Animator' is a clever bloodbath of gross-out gore, jet-black humor and sexual depravity; 86 minutes of fun.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Barbara Crampton is treated to a severed head-job...literally!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The first man to be re-animated at the morgue is Arnold Schwarzenegger's body double.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Pretty light stuf,  half comedy and half suspense but mostly the former.  Hitchcock always places himself in all his movies in subtle ways but this time he does so in a blatant and hilarious way.  No doubt he thought the same of the film which was not subtle or deep but stunningly shot both photographically and per location.  A wonderful quality film even though \\"Hitchcock Lite\\".
B005LAIGSC|3.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Denzel Washington is a fugitive being watched by CIA agent Ryan Reynolds in a safe house. After an intense battle that sees the safe house breached, he now has to watch him whilst they're both on the run.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />I love action films just like any other person of the male gender, but if a film could ever be described as having too much action, this is it. The film begins with a bang with the safe house being attacked and the two protagonists escaping. But, by the middle of the film the actions scenes become almost repetitive, making the character development flimsy and uninteresting. At one point, after an admittedly awesome action scene lasting several minutes, they escape in a car, only to have their car taken out (no more that 20 seconds later), forcing them to run...cue action, again. Washington and Reynolds do admirable jobs; however, the direction was lazy and unstylistic and a laughably clich&eacute; ending left me with an overall feeling of, `meh'.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />A great game of cat and mouse is played out in front of thousands of fans at a South African football match.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The movie was originally set in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, but the production decided not to shoot there due to security concerns.

B004EPYZXK|1.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Old footage reveals the fate of three astronauts during the secret `Apollo 18' mission and the reason the U.S never went back to the moon.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Apollo 18 is another \\"found footage\\" film that is for the most part dull and boring. Following in the footsteps of `Blair Witch' and `Paranormal Activity', this movie suffers the same fate with a series of \\"somes\\". Some suspense, some horror but just when you think you're about to soil your seat, the moment is devoured by the usual shaky camera shit that renders confusion as you shrug your shoulders and shriek out a big \\"what the hell is happening!\\". Honestly, why do they persist with the found footage style? This films only redeeming feature is the nice visuals which capture the moon's dark lunar surface giving off an eerie feeling of hopeless isolation as paranoid astronauts Christie and Owen battle Russian conspiracies and an alien menace. Unfortunately by the time this alien menace revealed itself I was fighting my own battle with boredom.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Just watch the trailer, that has all the best bits!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The script was constantly re-written during the shooting of the movie.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is definately a good game,  has mini games, besides just finding objects. The story line is good but basic, and gives you the ability to skip dialogue and mini games if you want. I gave it 5 stars because it's entertaining, and the game is well rounded, has many chapters versus being short winded type of hidden objects game. The minor drawback of this game, is the you need a Facebook account to even play casual. This was a FAOTD.  Thanks Amazon, G5!

086571701X|5.0|I always thought there had to be a way to keep fishes with plants without expensive filters and constant maintenance and happened to stumble upon this Aquaponics phenomenon and it was beyond what i had even thought to hope for! Not only does it show how to combine fish and plants without filters, but it combined my love of herb and veggie gardening with my wish for a sustainable ecosystem that includes aquatic animals in a \\"circle of life\\" kind of way that is beneficial to both! Add in the most water efficient gardening system i have ever seen (NO water is wasted), accelerated plant growth, NO over-watering, and harvestable fish and it is a dream come true!<br />Aquaponic Gardening: A Step-By-Step Guide to Raising Vegetables and Fish Together is truly a wonderful book. It explains the science and how-it-works behind Aquaponics, as well as a breakdown of all the components, from the \\"hardware\\" (the tubs, pvc pipes and growing media) to the \\"software\\" (the plants and fish). It demonstrates how to do the simplest setup to more complex while explaining the pros and cons of each. If something goes wrong, somewhere in this book it tells you what went wrong, why, and how to fix it. Even at the end of the book when you have read everything, if you still have questions or need extra help, you are not left to drown. She gives you directions to different resources and reliable websites and online communities (including her own) for help.<br /><br />If you are looking for looking for a simple \\"screw point A to point B, plug into wall\\" Instruction book, then you have come to the wrong place. Buy a fish tank and plant a dirt garden, because if you want anything less than this book, then you are already doomed for failure. Nothing in this book is added idly.<br />If you want to skip past the science and just follow the steps and monitor your system as directed, you can, by all means, and good luck to you. But knowing the magic that is happening right in your backyard, greenhouse or basement is half the fun!<br />So if this sounds like something for you, BUY THIS BOOK and get started!r basement is half the fun!<br />So if this sounds like something for you, BUY THIS BOOK and get started!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus edition is something you don't want to miss out on. If you're a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, it really is one of a kind. Hugh Howey spins a yarn of astonishing greatness in this story. The plot will keep you guessing, and all the characters, good or bad, are fleshed out with vivid detail. A must read, and I can't wait to see what other magic Hugh Howey works with the story.<br />P.S. The very beginning made me think of Placebo's cover song \\"Running Up That Hill\\".

B005K0HDGE|4.0|As always this was a well-written Stephen King novel.  The man knows how to tell a tale....and lots of great \\"put you in the moment\\" details.  However, many of his books end by tying up things in a very messy fashion.  I almost felt like this was how this book was going to end too....however, it was tied up very nicely.  This is a book, that folks who are wary of Stephen King as a horror novelist, should read (similar to Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, The Body (Stand By Me).  It is a thick book, but well worth savoring every word.  I really enjoyed this read.....and I'm a slow reader!

B007JM4CWY|4.0|I love the game and keep turning to it when I pick up my phone.  I do think the controls could be improved upon, but the game is not a high speed arcade game that is ruined because controls aren't perfect.  I am dealing with a really annoying bug wherein a setting is sometimes functional and sometimes not.  The &quot;doubling numbers&quot; setting recently started being goofy.  If both issues are worked out I can call it a five star app with the current $4.99 fee.
B0054VVRBQ|1.0|Just received product this week. Was working fine and then I updated my MacBook Pro to 10.7.4 and now it's no longer mounting SD cards.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I didn't read any reviews before I bought this book and I am glad I didn't so I could be very surprised. It was a very compelling read, very well written and kept me on the edge of my seat.  That said, I too, would have liked a more satisfying ending.  Not that the ending was inconsistent or unbelievable, but I am a Pollyanna girl at heart and like more hopeful endings.  This writer certainly has talents and smarts and I will probably read other books by her. This book was anything but bland and it was a challenging read for all the information you get... I did feel smarter (temporarily) for getting a lot of obscure references, and here I am a Tennesse girl who has never even been to the Big Apple! Just shows we don't ALL live in mobile homes and only watch hunting shows or televangelists...(cue the ironic laughter).
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|A truly amazing  movie that is differant every time you watch it, music that tells the story of a rocker and his downfall into the depths of madness truely it should be studied in school it would probably help some of them ;)>
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, a great cast, a timely premise, but its just a mess of movie with way too many loose ends.  The ending (no spoiler alert here) - just left me wondering if the only thing they heisted was an hour and a half of my life.  I had to go back a couple of scenes to see if I missed something in the ending that would have explained it better.  Just felt like someone said \\" two minutes! shut it down and its a wrap\\"  Stiller equals Stinko lately, with maybe only Adam Sandler with more poor choices.  Movies like this are making me forget that he had talent at one time.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really want to give these books 5 stars, but I can't get over the irritating repetitiveness of their fights and sex scenes!  With that, however, the books are truly addicting, I read the whole trilogy in 5 days! 'Darker', was a mix of heartbreak, fast pace excitement, romance, and sillyness all rolled into one. The character of Grey was really a walking contradiction in this one, for being such a private man, he did alot of public displays of affection with Steele. Why hasn't the good Dr. Flynn ever asked what was wrong with her for wanting to be in a relationship with Mr. Fifty Shades, they might both be just too screwed up to be with anyone else. I do like how romantic the story could be, but you just knew that after any romantic gesture and love making, there would be a huge fight and then them having \\"kinky f******y\\" make up sex in the \\"red room of pain\\". Too predictable. If you read the first one, this is a must read, I did read this one alot quicker as I was unable to put it down! I love my \\"Fifty Shades.\\"
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Seriously, holy ****.<br /><br />Did that really just happen?????<br /><br />This series is amazing.<br /><br />It was hovering between four and five stars for a while, but that right there, that was definitely a five star season.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|OMG!!!! Let me start with the 'Meet Fifty Shades' supplement at the end, Brilliant. I loved, loved the point of view of Christian Grey when he first met Ana, fantastic. It left me wanting to read the whole series from his perspective, that being said, let's dive in to 'Freed.' Imediately after reading of their engagement, I purchased 'Freed', I would have liked a little more on their wedding, I was at this point more into the relationship that their boring, we can't think of anything new to do sex. So the book starts out decent, their honeymoon was way, way too long!!! The \\"plot\\" of Hyde coming after Grey for revenge was exciting, until they reveal why he as after them, it seemed kind of ridiculous. Again their relationship was the same ol crap of, sex-she doesnt obey-fight-sex :(. My hope for the end of this book was a cliff hanger of sorts, that would hopefully open up a new series of \\"Fifty Shades\\" novels, but they seem to live out an entire lifetime and have everyhting tied up into a neat little \\"grey tie\\" in the last few chapters and the epilogue. Kind of disappointing, I really really wanted \\"MORE\\" (yes shouty capitals)!!!!<br /><br />I do agree with alot of the reviews of these books, the writing could of been better, the typos fixed, the mix of her friends with all of his siblings was unnecessary, the over annoying use of this phrase \\"he cupped my sex\\" what does that even mean, oh and \\"his possesion/erection\\" (grrr). I would say by far the best book in series is 'Fifty Shades of Grey', I loved the chase, Grey changing his life for a woman, falling in love when he didnt think it was possible, and their palpable chemistry, I was on the edge of my seat!<br /><br />With all of my mixed reviews and emotions, when I  was done reading this book, I felt lost, like what I am gonna do now with my free time..LOL. It is hard to say goodbye to these fun, exciting, annoying, mercurial ;), characters. Please, please let there be MORE \\"Fifty Shades\\" Ah, I beg!!!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a can't put it down type of book. The sex scenes were well written out and also realistic in the sense of S&M. The characters were in fact not teenage written but fantasy written. He was a rich young man of 26 and she was still in college, just about to graduate. He could have any woman on earth yet he chose and fell so deeply in love with a no body, a young innocent young woman. The writers characters made you want to find out more about their story. There was a back ground story as you read the book. What happened in this mans life to make him the man he was at 26. Then there is the conflict, the friend that wants more than friendship; then comes the resolution. Then the second book develged deeper into the love story and insecurities that love brings out in people. On to book three which was more of a book about their families and their devoted love for one another. What lenghts men and women go to in order to protect the ones that they love. For those of you that gave this a horrible review, why read eroticia if you can not understand the dynamics of it. It is about control, and submission. It is about being able to give yourself mind, body and soul to another. It is not about the love that you and your husband have together nor the great sex that you may share. If you are worried about the young women in the world and their perception of a healthly sex life- have no fear, a lot of young women are doing the S & M thing, the times have changed and the kids call it \\"friends with benefits\\" these days. This is in order to have sex with no strings attached. I also think that \\"holy craps and other young language depicted was to bring the reader back to the fact that the character Anna was an innocent that was not hard core, she was young, inexperienced to the ways of his world. Her speech also made you care about her and at the same time wonder \\"what the hell was she thinking when she agreed to be a submissive.\\" Submissive was in her nature, yet she wasalso strong willed and stood up for what she believed in. Also the biting of the lip or eye rolling,these were not meant as filler, they were meant to depict uncertainty,on her part and temptation on his. The eye rolling was her way of telling him \\"WHATEVER\\" which would set him off and he would do what any dominant would do, punish her... Read the book you will not be disappointed, if you keep an open mind to what the writer is writing about.
B006H8BIIM|4.0|The iap are not required. I guess everyone just has issues with doing some grinding.<br /><br />I love the concept of this game. It's tower defense, but you get to pick the layout. My only gripe is the only way to pause is the back button, but then you can't return to the game. You have to save and exit, and then resume. Which is just annoying. Great game otherwise. Thanks Amazon!
0765316994|5.0|In the depths of the Internet is an idea called \\"genre savvy.\\"<br />That term comes into play when the characters in a work of fiction understand their situation and break the fourth wall (that being the normal term for the \\"wall\\" separating the reader from actors) to turn that situation to their advantage.<br />In \\"Redshirts,\\" Scalzi takes \\"genre savvy\\" to a new level, not shying away from the awkward questions that follow when a character begins to ask what is real and what is fiction.<br />Redshirts is set in a Star Trek-like universe in which a handful of flat characters (the redshirts, a nod to original Star Trek) begin to wonder why so many of them are dying.<br />Their story has comedic turns, but the first part of the book is largely black comedy. Toward the end, however, the story takes a surprisingly serious turn and at the end hits an emotional note that's sung perfectly.<br />Scalzi has done a wonderful job targeting a story at readers who have read standard sci-fi for so long and know all the hoary tropes. Don't expect a send-up of Star Trek -- that's been done before. Expect a unique story that's worth your time.

0345803485|1.0|I tried reviewing this before but my potty mouth left them rejecting my review.  In short its written for a high school girl who has maybe had sex once or twice with her boyfriend and this book details what the fantasy world of sex is supposed to be like.  It s poor syntax, noone talks that way, and no one blushes or bites her lip that much or that often.<br /><br />Its literally written at a like a 6th grade reading level with a storying line designed for adolescent girls.  But what does that say for all the woman ages 10-70 who are reading it and loving it?  Perhaps its just like the unrealistic pornography I watch... my plumber will never be a smoking hot blonde and if I deliver a pizza the girl will not sleep with me.  So perhaps this book is just stooping to everyday porn's levels of simple ridicularity.
B00356CO1E|5.0|This is one of my favorite workouts ever. It is a full body workout in well under 30 minutes, and when that's all the time you have, this workout is the very best. There are 3 workouts in the shredded series, with this one being the easiest. Personally, I don't care for the 2nd and 3rd, so I just do this one. I also like to mix up my workouts with some of Jillian's other DVDs.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I can't imagine why anyone would give this movie a bad review.<br /><br />This movie features a large amount of the alt-retro and steampunk technology that would have been considered futuristic a century ago when the original story was written.  The flying machines with movable wings, the flintlock type pistols and the use of swords alongside the lasers and magic combine to push back the edges of imagination and remind me of what it is like to have a child's imagination.<br /><br />The reviews of this movie on Yahoo Movies show a number of people saying exactly what I feel, that I missed this movie in the theaters because I believed the reviews of the critics.<br /><br />I watched the movie twice during the rental period.  Never done that before.
B005LAII08|4.0|After last year's Cars 2, many were wondering if Pixar was starting to see a downward turn from the Pixar that gave us the toy story series, UP, and Finding Nemo. Many went this summer to see Brave to see for themselves if Pixar was going to be giving us another great Pixar film, or a Pixar film that is better than most but poor in comparison to their other films. I took my 5 year old son with this goal in mind.<br /><br />I must say that Pixar returned to the fold of giving a great story with beautiful animations like they have in the past. Brave will not stand up to some of the greater Pixar films (and in my opinion those are Monsters Inc, UP, Toy Story 3, and Incredibles) but it is far better than some of the worst (Cars, Cars 2, Bugs life...once again my opinion). It sits right in the middle IMO of all of the Pixar films. And lets be honest, with respect to all other animated films...or live action for that matter, being an average to above average Pixar films is better than 95% of what else is out there.<br /><br />***Spoilerish***<br />The story is about a young princess and her mother for the most part. The young girl is a free spirit while her mother, the queen, is attempting to train her to be a presentable future queen. The young girl is set to be married to one of three princes that, as tradition dictates, are to compete for her hand. The young princess decides to compete for her own hand to free herself from her obligations. This does not set well with the queen and results in a large fight that ends with the princess running away to a witch and asking her help to change her destiny. Let's just say that you should always be careful what you wish for and her actions result in the kingdom falling into disarray. While the kingdom is falling apart, the young princess works to figure out a way to turn back her decisions and mend the battered relationship between her and the queen.<br /><br />There is plenty of humor to keep the kids interested and plenty of adult humor to keep the parents from nodding off. I will say that my 5 year old was frightened a few times throughout the movie so I will warn that some younger children may not like it.<br /><br />After the movie, my wife said it wasn't funny enough and my son said it was too scary, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Is it among the best Pixar films? No but it is a great film and a pretty good one for Pixar...which is better than 95% of everything else.dult humor to keep the parents from nodding off.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|.. I could not drag myself through one more page.  I regret ever attempting to read this \\"best belling novel.\\"  The storyline and characters are ridiculously simplistic and juvenile.  Her female lead is laughably unrealistic and reminds me of a hormonal, brain-dead pre-teen ... I'm wondering if this WAS written about a 13 year old.... I'm glad I only wasted $10 on the first book and didn't get suckered into buying the trilogy in its entirety.  Honestly, you can find FAR more well written stories on an unnamed FREE amateur erotic fiction website.

I was completely blown away by the remarkable characterization, the outstanding story-line and the poetic writing. I felt as if I was reading a true story, so immersed in the characters and their lives that I forgot that it was fiction. Is it fiction?<br />I finished this book in one day and it's a long novel. Up until one in the morning and unable to put it down, so entranced that I easily stayed awake.

1936608898|5.0|When I heard about It Starts with Food, I was so psyched! Melissa (then Urban) was the first blog I ever read when I began my first CrossFit stint. This led me to the Paleo lifestyle and ultimately, my blog.<br /><br />I always tell the people who read my blog that if they are going to do anything before starting Paleo, let it be to read a book. And while I preach this constantly, I had never read a Paleo book cover-to-cover because frankly, the thought of sitting down to read a scientific play-by-play of my body bores me. I'd rather eat.<br /><br />I wanted a book that I could wrap my head around.<br /><br />It Starts with Food seemed like the perfect place to start. I'm already ten times more informed than I was three days ago. The best part? The use of metaphors to help people like me, and maybe you, understand. So far, at chapter 5, they have referenced chocolate chip cookies a handful of times to describe how your body reacts to food. Now, that I can wrap my head around.<br /><br />Whether you're just getting into the Paleo lifestyle, or you're a two year veteran, this book really is the perfect place to start.

B008FC4WA4|5.0|This story was a lot of fun, and Hornby does a great job fleshing out a character in a short amount of time. Much like his other writing, it's rare to find a page without a few great lines. The idea of an ex writing a tell-all column is a great premise, but it could have easily been wasted had Hornby made the main character a good guy who was simply being libeled by his ex, but it's much more interesting that he is sort of a bastard. He's not a worse person than everyone else, but he's certainly not perfect, and that's what keeps the story interesting.<br /><br />As a man married to a journalist who often writes columns about her life, I guess this could also be a cautionary tale for me. For Hornby fans, or anyone looking for a fairly light but entertaining half-hour read, \\"Everyone's Reading Bastard\\" is a bargain.

0061974307|5.0|After reading other reviews, I agree with those who mentioned that the ending did not bring closure, but that is one of the things I appreciated about it.  It is a testament on real life - it goes on whether we agree or disagree with it.  But, we must accept it.<br /><br />A beautifully written book where the voices of every character can be heard.
0765316994|3.0|I've followed John Scalzi's blog Whatever for quite a while and wanted to read his books for some time but haven't done so until now. As soon as I saw the synopsis of Redshirts I knew I had to read it. Luckily for me he was signing copies at BookExpo America last week. I read it on the train ride home which is some kind of record for me even though the book is a fast read.<br /><br />Redshirts is a bit different in his structure. The actual story takes place in the first couple hundred pages and is then followed by three codas, or short stories. The main part of the book is this, and I'll stay away from spoilers as much as possible: in a space opera-y future, some new ensigns join the crew of the Intrepid. Andrew Dahl is one of these new ensigns and once aboard him and his friends notices that whenever there's an away mission, one low ranking team member never returns alive. He decides to investigate this seemingly impossible matter and gets an answer maybe no one expects.<br /><br />Of course, this is spoof on Star Trek and how redshirts always end up dying for dramatic effect. It's also a spoof on everything silly in the science fiction drama and I have to say it was utterly enjoyable. I was giggling all through the book. There's a lot packed in here for those who are familiar with Star Trek and similar television and fans will have a fun time trying to find all the Easter eggs.<br /><br />Now, there's really not a lot I can go into without spoiling the ending. But I will say this: the ending went somewhere I didn't expect it to, partly ridiculous and partly awesome. The three codas offer some closure to the mysteries left behind, but also provides some more questions. It's not like I felt that there were loose ends, just that the ending allows you to interpret some of the events in your own way.<br /><br />My main criticism is that there's a giant cast of characters and none of them really felt well defined.

B00005JN8Z|5.0|An Empire Ruled By A Madman. Hope Is Lost. Faith Is Broken. A Fire Will Rise.<br /><br />QUO VADIS is an excellent film depicting the rise of Christianity amidst the tyranny of Rome in 64 A.D. Starring Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Leo Genn and Peter Ustinov, the movie is mostly accurate in recreating what happened in Rome during this tumultuous period in history, which is more than can be said for almost any movie made these days about a historical event (300, anyone? that piece of wasted celluloid is sooooo inaccurate, just by looking at a trailer or a TV spot, it's not worth wasting your time on. And don't even get me going on Gladiator, Titanic or even Braveheart). Ben-Hur is another excellent Biblical epic, shot ON LOCATION AND WITH REAL EXTRAS...and there were thousands of them, same thing with The Ten Commandments (and I mean the silent AND sound versions of these epic films, made in 1923, 1925, 1956 and 1959). Of course, there is a fictional story at the center of the historical events; however, this only adds more weight to the already human drama playing out on screen. And this is also the way movies were made back then: with reverence toward Jesus and God, and NO graphic violence, profanity or sexual content (which is again more than can be said for Gladiator, 300, Titanic or any other movie that is purportedly based on a historical event made these days). And don't let the length scare you off, either. Aside from the acting, which is excellent, the music (by Miklos Rosza, who would score the collossal epic sound version of Ben-Hur 8 years later) is also beautiful. Buy it, you won't regret it.<br /><br />This film is Not Rated.

0345803485|1.0|I hate to say it but I just had to see what all the fuss was about so I jumped on the 50 Shades of Grey bandwagon. I really wish I hadn't. It is very poorly written and the storyline (apart from the sex) is practically non-existent. Oh my, holy crap and my inner goddess are so overused throughout the book. Give this a miss if you enjoy reading a good book with a gripping storyline. I really can't understand the hype surrounding this book.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|okay, so I loved the first and second book, but Mockingjay i can only describe as depressing. it all goes downhill for katniss from the beginning, and in the end, she's left with nothing except peeta and haymitch. and the moral is, nomatter how hard life is, you have to keep going. how sad is that???????? i wish i had never read this book, because then i could just inmagine that disrtrict 12 would have been rebuilt and prim would not be dead and katniss's best friend would not have deserted her.

0062073494|3.0|Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie<br />Agatha Christie has become an antique. She may once upon a time have broken ground for her genre. She certainly became its poster child, selling unbelievable numbers of book and becoming the go-to comparison for any female mystery writer who aspired to greatness - Ngaio Marsh, Margery Allingham, P.D. James.<br />A catchy tune or two and some good PR can go a long way - think of the Monkees, and all the boy bands that have proliferated since. But four BILLION copies in circulation, and claiming the third rank behind Shakespeare and the Bible as most widely published? Those are truly awesome numbers.<br />I decided to read Murder on the Orient Express (or MotOE) because we recently got a boxful of Christie books at an auction. I enjoyed them when I was younger, and first started reading mysteries. They were often stuffy and slightly dumb, but it was a stereotypical stuffiness that defined \\"British\\". Part of the magic of Christie is that she introduced into that perfectly conventional scene the convention defying. I refer to the slightly subversive quality of the characters she made famous: Miss Marple, the wise old everywoman who never misses a trick while hiding in plain sight, and Hercule Poirot, the fussy little foreigner who was amusing until he had your nuts to the fire.<br />The problem I find after reading MotOE is that I enjoy watching the BBC version of Poirot's adventures more than I enjoyed reading the book. The reason is simple - it only takes an hour to watch, which is about right for these stories. What you lose in the translation is a lot of red herring dangling, and a load of outdated British-isms.<br />I have been thinking about how to reduce the number of books on our shelves to make room for, well, more books, and since I finished MotOE I have been eyeing those Christie's, which are occupying a long stretch of bookshelf real estate. All of which brings me back to Dame Agatha being an antique. Oneof the things that make antiques worth keeping is their value, and that is often dependant in turn on their scarcity. This is where Christie's publishing history starts to work against her - with 4 billion in print, it's going to be a long time before they are worth anything at all. Now that I think of it, the DVD's of the BBC versions are thinner than the books, and they have three episodes each. Hmm ....
B001AQO3QA|5.0|There is nothing bad to be said about this. 4 blurays of movie and 2 of extras. The quality is superb.
B0086700CM|5.0|So people just keep complaining about how it does work once so they rate it a 1/5 even tho they say they like the game. Stupid people. The game could have some more addons or improvements to help the game have a much higher replay value but considering it took like half a year for them to just change the already made game on a new platform I doubt this game will ever have any major updates in the future

B001CT877Q|5.0|One of Arnolds best action film. Fast paced, Vanessa Williams does a excellent job of portraying a target of a goverment employee who \\"knew too much\\". Arnold- is- well Arnold as a US Marshall in the witness protection program, and James Caan does an OUTSTANDING job as a villian....Lot's of action, the supporting characters ( James Colburn, Andy Romano, et al) flesh out the movie wonderfully. But, one of the best parts of the film is the performance of the late Robert Pastorelli (The painter on the old Murphy Brown TV show). He plays a mobster that was rescued by Arnold's character and he helps him with the recovery of the super guns. An underrated actor-it's a shame. If you like action/adventure, this will fit the bill. Fortunately, Arnold keeps the puns down to a minimum in this movie. I challenge you to find it.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Don't listen to the naysayers, this movie is much better than the critics say.  Why this was a bomb at the box office we might never know.  Perhaps it's was the goofy title, perhaps it was the screwed up marketing or bad trailers, heck they didn't even make toys for this movie.  But it's a much better movie than many of the science fiction movies floating around these days.  Do yourself a favor and watch it!
B0058YPGL6|4.0|I started watching this show this may, I really wish i watched this when it first aired only to find my super hero Moma had got this for my birthday! I finally cought up when MTV showed pre-aired episodes. I am in love with this and wish you can see what mean. There are lots of fun special features with a very funny gag real. WARNING in the gag real Tyler Posey drops a F- bomb in the back ground. There is cussing and lots of kissing scenes, but they stop before it gets to far. Teens will love this show for sure! I know I do! Thanks for taking time to read this !
B00782O7IY|3.0|Silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardain) is on top of the Hollywoodland world until a random encounter with Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) foreshadows the ascendancy of talkies, the gradual death of silent films, and Valentin's plummeting career.  The film's Valentin-centric portrayal is interesting because it's represents the desperate, somewhat stubborn manner in which Valentin fights inevitability.  Although, the end of the film alludes to why he may not have had a choice.<br /><br />While \\"The Artist\\" was interesting, neither the homage nor the plot was original (which isn't to say they weren't appreciated).  The former was accomplished by Mel Brooks and the latter in roughly every other movie made.  It is compelling enough, however, that I didn't look away.  Perhaps that is part of the charm?  A viewer must fully invest in a silent film.  This holds particularly true in this case, because any skeptical viewer (like me) wants to unearth the reasons why so many awards were won.  I was compelled to comprehend why the movie was so rewarded.  I thought the film was decent, but certainly not deserving.  Michael Bay is proof that technology doesn't create a better movie.  I'd rather watch a \\"The General\\" with Buster Keaton than Transformers 2.  Having said that, however, there is a reason why silent films were overrun by talkies and why I scream at my family members when we play charades.  Pantomiming doesn't convey the full expression, intent, or emotion.<br /><br />What the film lacks in sound and color the two leads mostly compensate.  Dujardain is mesmerizing as he hams it up, over-accentuating every facial movement, every smile, laugh, grimace.  Bejo is almost equally adept, but she more than makes up for it in pure beauty.  Both stars look the part, and if there were one award this film deserved it would be Best Supporting Actor for Uggie, the Jack Russell Terrier co-star.  One scene with Uggie and Dujardain at a dinner table is absolutely priceless, in any generation, with or without sound.  Impeccable timing.<br /><br />Ultimately, Directory Michel Hazanavicius leaves viewers with nostalgia and respect for a bygone era.  Like his title character, Hazanavicius wishes to save, or at least respect, silent films of the past.  Eulogies are intended to aid listeners' - in this case, viewers' - memories.  To reacquaint the senses with what was once enjoyable.  To appreciate the innocence and the story-telling missing from many contemporary films with all the \\"advantages.\\"any generation, with or without sound.

0345803485|5.0|I heard about Fifty Shades on the radio and decided to check it out. Very good trilogy and at a great price. I looked in stores and they are about $18 a piece. I finished the entire set in about a week and have already started reading them again!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|i don't know what the attraction is, I forced myself to read Book One, the writing is seventh grade level and if that character bit her lip or looked through her lashes one more time I was going to scream.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had to remind myself that Cheryl was 22 when she took this adventure- she did not have the experience and wisdom that (hopefully) comes with age to have much self-awareness in regard to relationships. She had not grown up enough to be able to love and accept her family as they were. Walking the PCT helped put her on the path to adulthood, as we learn in her story.<br />Spoiler- I was so happy that  she did not come off the trail with a man! She learned that she could make it on her own. She met him later.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a very good movie that is highly recommended for anyone doing foster care or adoption. It sees past the color of skin and where a child is from. Very uplifting and inspiring.
0425263908|3.0|There was not the emotional connection between the reader and the main characters as there was in Fifty Shades.  Eva falling in front of Gideon twice was a bit much, even for someone who is uncoordinated as I am.  Like a fast pace read, but too fast and there was no development of being drawn in with the plot.  Wish I had read it before I read Fifty.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book. It has romance between Eve and Gideon, action, Eva and Gideon have a dark passed that hopefully work itself out because they are both crazy about each other.  Just like Fifty Shades. I would recommend this book to any of my friends

B0087IT8FK|4.0|\\"The Intouchables\\" (2011 movie from France; 112 min.) brings the real life story (more on that later) of Philippe, a wealthy tetraplegic, and Driss, a young and poor man from the ghettos, who is hired as his live-in carer. Driss seems to not care about much but himself, although he is also dealing with family issues in parts of the movie. But Driss and Philippe strike a bond, and become closer as the movie develops. I don't want to give more away from the plot as you'll just have to see how it all plays out, but I will say there are some surprises.<br /><br />That said, this is a great movie, and as such the \\"feel good\\" movie of the year so far. It was a packed house when I saw it this weekend at my local indie theatre here in Cincinnati, and the crowd just loved it, laughing at many occasions. But the movie really didn't hit home for me until the credits rolled and, low and behold, it brought some actual footage from the real Philippe and Driss in one of the scenes recreated in the movie. (As an aside, the real Philippe and Driss are nowhere near as nice looking as in the movie, but that's of course why movies are movies). Moreover, we are then also told what happened to these guys in real life since then.<br /><br />François Cluzet (as Philippe) and Omar Sy (as Driss) provide superb performances, and in fact Sy won the French equivalent of the Oscar for Best Actor, and rightfully so. In all, this is a great movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0131480057|5.0|I've been a big fan of the authors since the 2nd edition was released.  I was kind of dissapointed when they split it into separate Unix-Linux books, especially because of the cost.  Glad to see it's back into one large book for the 4th edition.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is THE admin book to have for those who do this for a living.  No unix/linux admin book will ever cover everything, especially since you have to decide if you want to be aimed at beginners or experienced admins, or try to include both.  This series has always been for the experienced admins, and covers a TON of real-world issues in the world of unix-administration.  They cover the main topics, the differences in major releases, and show you exactly where to go for more detailed information, if needed.  Easy.  And a great sense of humour throughout, like the LESS guy dumping the MORE coffin into the sea on the cover of the book.<br /><br />The free on-line version is a great bonus, even if it is slightly flawed.  Unfortunately, a page-by-page on-line version of an admin manual still isn't the best option.  There needs to be a more interactive way to go back/forth to different topics, be able to view different pages at once, etc.  For now, the paper format is still the best, as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />5 stars, period.  If you have the 2nd edition, you MUST get the 4th.  If you bought both the Unix and Linux versions of the 3rd, it could hurt a bit to spend another $XX for this edition, but it is worth it.<br /><br />If you're a \\"professional\\" unix admin, I highly recommend looking at getting this book.
1400034779|3.0|If you're like me, you like to read on vacation, and you've had the experience of bringing along for a fun trip some entirely inappropriate book--something relentlessly tragic and depressing and heavy. Completely the wrong mood. Through poor planning on my part, or maybe by my trying to bring along the thickest books possible, this routinely happens to me. (First world problems, I know!) But I'm pleased to report that it did not happen on my most recent vacation, because I brought along The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br /><br />This book is more or less a series of vignettes starring Mma. Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's foremost (and only) female detective. It's not a traditional mystery novel; generally a problem is both introduced and solved in the same chapter, and then there are chapters like \\"Mma. Ramotswe Thinks About the Land While Driving Her Tiny White Van to Francistown,\\" which is exactly what it sounds like (don't worry if that sounds a bit dull though; the chapter's only three pages long). It's a light, feel-good, often humorous, enjoyable little book, and with enough genuine warmth to keep it from feeling irredeemably shallow or stupid.<br /><br />Mma. Ramotswe, as she's called throughout the book (Mma. being a respectful term of address for women in Botswana, pronounced as it's spelled) is a likeable protagonist; she's warm-hearted and doesn't put up with nonsense and I like that she's a size 22, \\"traditionally-built African lady\\" and proud of it. The writing is competent and while we don't see a lot of Botswana's culture, there's a decent amount here. And it's nice to read a book set in Africa that isn't about war or atrocities. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about a white male author writing about a black African woman, but Smith pulls it off well: he clearly loves Botswana, and so does Mma. Ramotswe, and he resists the urge to put any white characters in the book at all (at least I think he does; race isn't much of an issue here).<br /><br />So I very much enjoyed my time with this book; I didn't really mind that it's quite light, that the mysteries are often a bit over-the-top, that there isn't much structure or much of a climax. I'm giving 3 stars, though, because it's the kind of book that I'd only enjoy while on vacation, and now that I'm home I have no desire to read the sequel. Fortunately, the series seems to be a good mix of continuous and episodic--the next book moves on to the next chapter of Mma. Ramotswe's life, but this one still presents a complete story that doesn't demand readers consume the entire lengthy series to get some resolution.y much enjoyed my time with this book; I didn't really mind that it's quite light, that the mysteries are often a bit over-the-top, that there isn't much structure or much of a climax.

1781161313|4.0|Bought this site-unseen since I was so hyped to get a \\"technology\\" book based on the ALIENS movie.  My overall review is just \\"eh...\\"<br /><br />There is an absolute ton of detail, but it's written as a tecnical-manual (boring).  I was expecting more pictures/diagrams/exploded views.  I was really looking forward to seeing some detailed pics of the smart gun and the motion tracker, but there are only a couple of cursory pics, and a \\"history\\" of how the new stuff was better than the original.  eh<br /><br />I can't deduct stars from my review since the book was not what I expected, so I'll still give it 4 stars based on the solid amount of work they put into this book.  But I'll deduct one star for what I think is a big miss on what a really entertaining fiction-tech book can be.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|I happened to see the movie during a flight back from overseas. Since I was travelling in Busniess class I believe I saw it in its entirety (2hrs 20 mins or so). A friend has been talking about this movie and the books for some time now and I decided to watch it and form my own opinion. The movie did hold my attetnion from beginning to end but there were so many \\"holes\\" in the plot that I could not help myself from noticing. One of the biggest issues in the movie is the disparity of the ages of the contestants! How could a 12 year old boy or girl ever go against an 18 year old one? The whole idea is beyond absurd and I am not one having issues with \\"far off\\" ideas. Still, during the whole movie I kept being reminded that sompething must be really wrong with the whole human race watching their kids getting slaughtered like animals. How long would a dictatorship like this last if they messed around with a society's chil;dren? And why children in the first place?<br /><br />Another part of the movie I had a serious issue with is the \\"blood bath\\" at the beginning of the HGs! Some kids almost acted like expert killers having no issue what-so-ever to gut another human being. Totally unbelievable because there is no precedence in the movie to indicate a society that was in such chaos.<br /><br />Anyway, i am undecided whether I liked this movie or not. Cinematography was great, and the score especially at the endof the movie stuck in my head like a dream. I guess I should go ahead and read the book in order to see where the movie is coming from. My opinion might change then...
B0049KWAVY|5.0|BUY THIS!  Thought I'd just say it right out front rather than towards the end.  The original analog releases of the Carpenters were the best at that time.  I've seen some SACD and many advertised as \\"remastered and re-released.\\"  I stumbled upon this and several other artist releases done in Japan using this K2 HD Master.  The first copy I ordered was Air Supply's Greatest Hits.  It was awful.  Before I had received the Air Supply disc, I had already ordered this and a few others.  After I received them, I debated on sending them back due to the higher cost.  More frustrated at potentially getting burned again, I went ahead and opened The Carpenters Gold.  I knew I was in for a treat as soon as the music started playing, and Karen'ts voice pierced the air.  This is one sweet disc (refer back to the first two lines I started the review with).  I lived in Japan for 6 years and tried to keep up with the ever increasing technology advances, when I left, SACD wasn't even talked about then.  After listening to most formats out there now, I'd rate them in this order (1) DTS:  when an insert comes with the disc telling you to be careful in playing it loud on your system as it could cause damage, that's tops in my book (where is an AC/DC release?) (2) SACD (3) K2 HD Master (4) Mobile Fidelity gold CD (4) remastered releases.  To end up this review on the Carpenters, it's definitely worth the money getting it.  Of the 6 I've purchased so far in the K2 HD Master series, only Air Supply has been the disappointment.  Hearing the Carpenters like this really brings back the memories.
1400032717|5.0|This novel is excellent. In fact, I enjoyed reading it so much that I finished it in four hours. It's funny, pensive, quirky, and lovable. The protagonist grabs your attention and your affection right from the start, and you can't help but empathize with him on his journey. Everyone should read this book. It should be a staple in every high school. Just excellent.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Perhaps I might have given this film two stars, or possibly three had it been placed in the horror film genre. At least with a horror film you can expect to see endless absurdities and flaws.<br /><br />The first being is how they portray wolves. Absolute rubbish and not anywhere near how these magnificent creatures behave. But, as I mentioned, had it been classified as a horror film I would perhaps have forgiven this absurdity. The \\"wolves\\" in this film all had glowing eyes and looked ridiculously fake as to be laughable.  King Kong in the original film looked more believable. Christ, couldn't the director have at least used some stock film footage of REAL wolves.<br /><br />Let's forget about the \\"wolves\\" and move on to these seven men who miraculously survived a plane crash at 400MPH! Throughout the film they are subjected to extreme bitter cold temperatures, numerous accidents and a few vicious attacks by the \\"wolves'. Yet, miraculously, their wounds seemed to simply disappear, and not ONE ever shows signs of experiencing any signs of frost bite. Well....maybe a few sniffles here and there, but nothing that wiping their nose could not handle so that they could move on in this film.<br /><br />In one scene Liam Neeson spends a good amount of time in freezing water (which would obviously kill a man), but yet again, when he gets out he shows no signs of being the least bit cold, and miraculously his clothes dry out in a matter of minutes. One man actually leaped about 30 feet across a ravine into a tree and ended up with nothing more than simply letting out a grunt (Rocky the Flying Squirrel?)<br /><br />Hey.....if anything it might be worth watching for a few laughs. Other than that, FORGET this movie.

B0006OR0L2|1.0|This is a review of the PAL Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom dvd release.<br /><br />This is a fraudulent product.  The back of the case says \\"aspect ratio 1.66:1 - Widescreen Anamorphic,\\" but it is not!!  What we get is a poorly done pan and scan version.  It is very definitely NOT widescreen.  I don't know about the anamorphic part.  This dvd is poorly done and I find it difficult to watch at times.  I am quite disappointed.<br /><br />The part of the cropped image we do see is well done:  there is very little video noise, speckling, etc.<br /><br />This dvd has no credits at the end, another disappointment.  The imdb (internet movie database) says that the cast is announced by an voice off screen.  Four minutes are shaved from the run time.<br /><br />Amazon needs to change its advertisement on this particular product.<br /><br />I note that this item will be released as a mod-R in NTSC format in the USA soon.  I am hoping that it will be well done and in the proper aspect ratio.

B00846TRHY|5.0|This movie is a must see. It is rare to find a movie so passionate based on real events. This story is real life, that is what makes it so emotional. Hotel Uganda is the closest comparision I can make to this movie. It is very sad that this movie did not go national release instead it was a limited to a few theaters across the united states. This is no B-movie, high quality throughout, and a story that needs to be told.<br /><br />Joseph Kony is the biggest child murderer in history. Yet because it is Africa no one cares. Feeling sorry for them, saying words of support, that is not enough. If you want to help people, give. Give money, give time. They don't need words, they need action. This is still happening everyday.<br /><br />One of the most troubling but true to life parts of the movie is the donation solicitation. You see how much these people have, yet how little they are willing to give.<br /><br />Rent this movie. Enjoy it. Then do something about it.
B00834R580|5.0|There is a lot more humor in this one than in any of the others. I watched this episode twice, and it wasn't until the second time through, that I saw all the subtleties in it. Watson calls Sherlock \\"Spock\\" when Sherlock bemoans the fact he's got an emotional response of fear. Sherlock admits in this episode that he really only has ONE friend, Watson. The very end shows just how determined Moriarity is regarding Sherlock. It's actually a fine episode, you just have to watch it closely and maybe more than once to get it all.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|This watch has quickly become one of my favorites.  I paid about $65 and for that price this watch can't be beat.  Its comfortable, keeps great time, and looks great.  In person, it looks like it should be priced about $150-200.  Its a good size, not huge, but large enough so that you wouldn't confuse it for a women's watch.  You do need to keep it wound but not having to crack the case open to replace a battery is a plus.  If you are the kind of person that likes to coordinate their watch with their wardrobe, you could purchase all 4 colors for under $300 and have all bases covered.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is great and addicting. Like other free games you have the option to buy extra coins or acorns to gain quickier items or land but you also can earn coins and acorns to advance just takes more time. its also completely obvious about actually buying them with real money unlike what people say because it says you don't have enough to do that would you like to purchase extra acorns or coins. also you can get out of the game by using the options and hitting the door Icon on the side to exit the game. but I recommend not letting little kids play unsupervised as they just buy things at random and then their parents blame the game instead of supervising what their children are playing which sounds like most of the issues people are having.
0307592731|4.0|I really enjoy memoirs and books that focus on challenging/survival situation. Wild fit the bill and was a fun was to pass the weekend. I agree with some of the complaints that it can be repetitive and that it may come off as a bit whiny at times, but overall I was intrigued with her journey and fascinated by a quest that seems so completely out of reach for most of us. I know I would have just about given up at the first blister or two and wouldn't have had the mental or physical strength to tackle something as monumental as the PCT.<br /><br />I was very disturbed by the scene where Cheryl and her brother kill their mother's beloved horse. I didn't think it added to the book or the story. It only detracted from her as a person. I couldn't imagine being party to raising a gun to a beloved animal and shooting her. The fact that she didn't die right away and needed to be shot several more times.... turned my stomach. Poor Lady, she didn't deserve to meet her end like that. I know this was hard to Cheryl to write, but it was also hard to read and made me think less of her.

0307719219|3.0|The book Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson comes with book-jacket praise from the usual suspects: Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame, Jared Diamond of Collapse fame, Nobel Prize \\"laureate\\" George Akerlof, and Niall Ferguson, champion of imperialism. Thomas Freidman dashed off a quick review in his New York Times column for April 1, 2012. Freidman, the giddy fan of globalization, was ecstatic, although he admitted that he was \\"reading\\" the book, but that he had not \\"read\\" it. Freidman points out one of the authors' main points: \\"Inclusive economic institutions that enforce property rights, create a level playing field, and encourage investments in new technologies and skills are more conducive to economic growth than extractive institutions that are structured to extract resources from the many by the few.\\"  And this is perhaps their main point, albeit one which they share with most neoliberal development economists. Acemoglu and Robinson are professors at Harvard University; Acemoglu is a winner of the John Bates Clark Medal in the Economics department and Robinson an area specialist in the department of Government (Political Science). The book seems to be aimed at a wider audience than academia, however.<br /><br />While the authors mine an enormous literature on development to populate their book with dozens of interesting stories of developmental failure and success, at the end of the day, their book devolves into the something similar to most of the neoliberal thinking of which we see so much from the \\"science\\" of economics. Diamond, who is quoted on the book jacket as saying \\"Like me, you may succumb to reading it in one go, and then you may come back to it again and again\\" is more critical in a review in the New York Review of Books (7 June 2012). There he points out that after presenting a map of Africa that clearly shows the tropical countries of the interior of the continent at the lowest end of the income scale they insist that geographic factors are \\"Theories That Don't Work\\" compared to their preferred \\"institutional\\" explanation. Diamond's reaction: \\"While institutions are undoubtedly part of the explanation, they leave much unexplained: some of those richer temperate countries are notorious for their histories of bad institutions (think of Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, and Libya), while some of the tropical countries (e.g., Costa Rica and Tanzania) have had relatively more honest governments. What are the economic disadvantages of a tropical location?\\" He concludes, \\"In their narrow focus on inclusive institutions, however, the authors ignore or dismiss other factors. I mentioned earlier the effects of an area's being landlocked or of environmental damage, factors that they don't discuss. Even within the focus on institutions, the concentration specifically on inclusive institutions causes the authors to give inadequate accounts of the ways that natural resources can be a curse.\\" After describing Acemoglu and Robinson's botched job in their explanation of the rise of agriculture \\"to assert, in the complete absence of evidence, that  . . .  hunter/gatherers had become sedentary because, for unknown reasons, they happened to develop innovative institutions through a hypothesized political revolution\\" he concludes that \\"Acemoglu and Robinson do themselves a disservice by misstating these findings.\\"<br /><br />The book has a few points to recommend it in this reviewer's mind: 1) Its insistence on uncertainty in the course of human affairs, 2) Its appreciation for the importance of centralized political structure on economic success, 3) Its recognition of the wasted resources that come with gross inequality. But it has glaring blind spots that should cause a critical reader pause.<br /><br />In the first chapter the authors quote from Fra Bartolome de Las Casas's book,  A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies. Las Casas is presented by the authors as a hero, who defended the rights of theindigenous people enslaved in the New World by the conquistadores. They seem positively unaware, however, of the irony that motivated Jorge Luis Borges to mention Las Casas in the very first chapter of HIS book, A Universal History of Infamy. For Las Casas's answer to the enslavement of the indigenous people of the New World was to import Africans to work in the Antillean gold mines. Thus Borges sees Las Casas not just as the savior of the indigenas of the New World (in which effort he was unsuccessful in any case) but as the father of \\"W.C. Handy's blues; . . .  the mythological dimensions of Abraham Lincoln; the five hundred thousand dead of the Civil War and its three hundred millions spent in military pensions; the entrance of the word \\"to lynch\\" into the thirteenth edition of the Spanish Academy . .\\" etc. This kind of irony is well over the heads of our authors.<br /><br />They take the \\"failure\\" of the Mayan civilization to be the result of their favorite themes of \\"creation of extractive political institutions\\" and lack of \\"creative destruction.\\"  They recognize that \\"the coalescence of these institutions created the basis for an impressive economic expansion\\" but see its collapse in the ninth century AD to be the result of the overthrow of the political system that had produced this expansion. They recognize that \\"existing archeological evidence does not allow us to reach a definitive conclusion about why the k'ubul ajaw and elites surrounding him were overthrown\\" but they take this collapse as evidence nonetheless for their theory that \\"extractive institutions\\" are the cause of that collapse. And concerning there diagnosis of \\"collapse\\", should a Mayan society that apparently thrived for close to one thousand years be considered a failure?  There is no discussion of the possibility that laterite formation in tropical soils had anything to do with this \\"collapse.\\" The story of the Mayans just becomes another example of their pet theory.<br /><br />I have mentioned \\"creative destruction\\". Although there is only one direct mention of the \\"great economist Joseph Schumpeter\\" in the book, there are references a plenty to Schumpeter's most memorable phrase. Creative destruction was explained by Schumpeter's as follows: \\"The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the same process of industrial mutation - if I may use that biological term - that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating the new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism.\\" (Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, page 83.) Schumpeter was convinced that the entrepreneur is the driving force for development in a capitalistic society. Keynes was not so sure, remarking \\"we are damned if we know\\" why capitalists invest.<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson seem to take as gospel that creative destruction is necessary for societal advance. Someone like Polanyi would no doubt not agree. Schumpeter's young Harvard colleague Paul Sweezy certainly did not agree when he participated with Schumpeter in their famous debate at the Harvard Graduate Student's Economics Club in the winter of 1946-47 (See \\"on the laws of capitalism, Insights from the Sweezy-Schumpeter Debate\\" in Monthly Review, May, 2011.) Sweezy's notes for the debate say that \\"There is no reason to deny Schumpeter's entrepreneurial type, but its significance is quite differently evaluated. For him the entrepreneur occupies the center of the stage; the accumulation process is derivative. For me the accumulation process is primary; the entrepreneur falls in with it and plays a part in it.\\" Sweezy was, of course, one of the most prominent American Marxist economists of the twentieth century. For him the historical process of evolution of society was crucial, as it was for Marx. And Schumpeter, even as an Austrian economist, had a profound appreciation for this. It is not fair to Acemoglu and Robinson to say that they are oblivious to history; their book is full of historical anecdotes. But this reader gets the sense that for them if a society would just get with the program and encourage capitalists, everything would come out all right.<br /><br />They rail against the monopolies and resistance to enclosure by the Tudor and Stuart kings in England. This is a typical response of the neoliberal. The problem is not market economies, but those that interfere with the \\"free\\" motion of these economies in society. They attribute the rise of the Industrial Revolution in England to an overcoming of the absolutism of the Tudors and Stuarts by the rise of \\"inclusive institutions\\" embodied in the Glorious Revolution by the rise of Parliament. But the destruction part of the rise of the entrepreneurial class gets little appreciation.<br /><br />This book contains almost no reference to socialist critique of the development policies which the authors prefer. This, of course, is typical of the environment of American academic departments of economics and political science, where our authors reside. In spite of their re-telling of many stories about the corruption and distortion imposed upon the people of the South by European imperialism in the nineteenth century, there is no mention of Lenin's Imperialism, Highest Form of Capitalism. No mention of Polanyi. The only significant mention of Marx is in a passage where they say \\"Lenin and his Communist Party were inspired by Marx, but the practice could not have been more different than the theory. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was a bloody affair, and there was no humane aspect to it.\\" In fact, the Russian Revolution was remarkably bloodless, since the army went wholly over to the Revolution very early in the process. There is no question that much blood was spilled during the Civil War and that enormous sufferingwas caused by the Stalinist purges and forced collectivization of agriculture in Russia, but that the authors would assume uncritically that this meant that the Revolution itself was \\"a bloody affair\\" is a telling indicator of apparent biases that shield them from facts that don't fit their view of reality. In a book that is so filled with facts, this ignorance seems systematic; as if they were searching out only the facts that fit their theory.<br /><br />The authors make an off-hand reference to current day Iraq (on page 444) with amazing lack of empathy for the impact of the \\"shock and awe\\" imposed on that country by the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld regime and the UN Sanctions that preceded it. They use Iraq's recent history to argue against the \\"theory of modernization\\" that they say \\"maintains that all societies, as they grow, are headed toward a more modern, developed, and civilized existence, and in particular toward democracy.\\"  They mention the \\"disastrous economic performance under Saddam Hussein's regime\\" without mentioning the years of pain imposed by continuing NATO-enforced sanctions and bombardment. For a more realistic estimate of that impact the reader is directed to Iraq Under Siege, The Deadly Impact of Sanctions and War, published in 2000, three years before \\"shock and awe.\\"  There the reader will find another reason behind that \\"disastrous economic performance\\" of the previous decade.  Anthony Arnove in the introduction to Iraq under Siege quotes from a Wall Street Journal article in 1999 citing unnamed US officials saying, \\"After eight years of enforcing a `no-fly zone' in northern [and sourthern] Iraq, few military targets remain.  . . . We are down to the last outhouse.\\"  Acemoglu and Robinson say that hopes for \\"pluralism\\" were  \\"dashed as chaos and civil war descended upon Iraqi society.\\"  This implies that the \\"chaos and civil war\\" were the result of some internal dynamic in Iraq without considering that what had descended onto Iraqi society was not just the \\"extractive institutions\\" of Saddam Hussein but also the wrath of the American Empire, imposed over a decade of economic sanctions and bombardment since the end of the first Iraq war, \\"Desert Storm\\". They fail to mention the possibility that 6,000 sorties and 1,800 bombs launched during the \\"longest sustained US air operation since the Vietnam War\\" had anything to do with the dissolution of Iraqi society that followed the second US land invasion by Bush, the younger.  Iraq had long since been \\"bombed back to the stone age\\" to quote an earlier American general talking about that earlier war. Acemoglu and Robinson make no mention of this.<br /><br />One of the interesting facts that the authors dredge up from the large anthropological and historical literature upon which they report is the story of Dutch colonialism in the East Indies. They tell the story of the Banda Islands which had established trading relations with English, Portuguese, Indian, and Chinese merchants for mace and nutmeg, which were indigenous to their islands. In 1621 the Dutch governor of Batavia (now Jakarta in Indonesia) Jan Pieterszoon Coen \\"sailed to Banda with a fleet and proceeded to massacre almost the entire population of the islands, probably about fifteen thousand people.\\"  He set up a plantation system in place of the thriving economic activity of the local Banda people and \\"divided the islands into sixty-eight plantations, awarded to sixty-eight Dutchmen, mostly former and current employees of the Dutch East India Company.\\" They use this to support their major thesis, that \\"European expansion  . . . sowed the seeds of underdevelopment in many diverse corners of the world by imposing, or further strengthening existing, extractive institutions.\\"  But their emphasis is on the \\"extractive institutions\\" and not on the fact that European imperialism imposed this reality by genocidal force of arms! This is a very strange emphasis to place on these facts.<br /><br />Diamond's critique in his NYRB article is a good summary of this book. There he points to \\"the authors' resort to assertion unsupported or contradicted by facts.\\" This book presents what is really a banal conclusion: that authoritarian institutions that impose the will of a small group of elites onto a population is the primary cause of \\"underdevelopment\\". This is a re-statement of Aristotle's Politics. The real questions are why these authoritarian institutions succeed in taking over power in so many societies and how societies with apparently \\"inclusive\\" institutions like those in current day United States have evolved into such unequal societies. This book leaves us no closer to an answer to these questions.<br /><br />The real problem that I have with this book is that it uncritically takes for granted the underlying assumptions from the neoclassical economist's tool box. They point out the obvious: \\"Europeans themselves stamped out the possibility of economic growth in many parts of the world that they conquered;  . . . the lands where Industrial Revolution originally did not spread remain relatively poor; . . . . the Industrial Revolution and other new technologies are unlikely to spread to places around the world today where a minimum degree of centralization of the state hasn't been achieved.\\" These conclusions are delivered with a tone of great solemnity, but no one but the most dogmatic libertarians or European chauvinists would seriously disagree. The question is how to change this. Their prescription of more \\"inclusion\\" the like of which we have in the United States may satisfy some, but it does not satisfy this reviewer.

I particularly like the faded look of the board as opposed to it being just white.<br /><br />My only problem is the squares can be hard to hit sometimes, which is solved by zooming in (the variable zoom is great as opposed to having an overview and 1 zoomed in view). It's just hard to fly through puzzles like you might on the computer with a mouse, but that doesn't really trends to be a problem on harder puzzles anyway.<br /><br />Overall Dynamix did a great job bringing Nonograms to the smartphone

B004BUGCRK|5.0|I confess I have never been a great fan of Sting. I have enjoyed some of his music but more often than not his songs have not appealed to me. As a result, when I flipping through the channels and noticed Sting was performing live in Berlin with an orchestra, it was more out of curiosity that I watched than anything else. I was floored. To say he was on top of his game would be an understatement. It was obvious he was inspired by the orchestra and they thoroughly enjoyed performing with and for him. They loved his music and it showed in every way and with good reason. I know some of the songs on this CD and the Live in Berlin CD are classics and some believe it is wrong to change classics. Michael Buble has made a career out of that. But the orchestration and the sheer power and ferocity that an orchestra brings to the music of Sting was and is a perfect blend to his songwriting prowess and the beauty of his music. It's the first time I fully appreciated his voice. It blended perfectly with the instruments. I bought both CDs. In a time where talented individuals who have honed their craft by countless hours of effort are replaced by electronic make believe with volume at full blast on every channel, this music reminded me why I have been in love with music all my life. These orchestrations unlocked the beauty of the music of Sting for me. I am buying tickets for his concert. If you love music, this CD and his Live at Berlin CD should be your next purchases.

1612183956|5.0|Wow!  Was NOT expecting that ending!  Talk about blowing your socks off!  The Pines is not what you expect in any way, shape or form.  A bit of horror, a bit of sci-fi, some action, lots of suspense, some mystery, a bit of intrigue all thrown together that works oh so well together.<br /><br />Don't let the title of the book fool you as this is one heck of a good book and once you get past the first three pages, you are definitely hooked and you can't let go until it is finished and you will not be disappointed.  An intricate storyline that doesn't confuse you or lead you astay.  Just a hell of a good story with well defined characters.<br /><br />I am a first time reader of Mr. Crouch's and I am really impressed by his writing.  If this is any kind of indication of his type of writing then I will be buying some of his books. Don't pass this one up as it is that good!

Now the four girlsare getting anonymous texts from someone named \\"A\\". \\"A\\" knows all their secrets.<br />It is a great book and you wont wont to put it down! I love this book and this series!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|A good way to while away your time while you watch TV.  Can be difficult to win.  My wife loves it.  Keeps her quiet.
B00899EOIS|5.0|I absolouteley LOVE this show!! Cant wait to find out who the new A is! You can watch this season live on Abc family on tuesday nights.
030758836X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this 'twisted' book.  Just when you thought, \\"okay, I'm onto you...\\", something else takes you by the surprise all the way to the very end of the book.  Which, by the way, gives one star less than a 5 star rating.  With all the twists, I was hoping for a little better last page.<br /><br />Thank you for a fun book though.  It was entertaining, to say the very least.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I find filled with many options keeping you constantly entertained and never bored. Great for younger kids to stay busy when needed
0307951529|5.0|After growing up the child of entrepreneurs, I said I would never run my own business due to watching their struggles.  However times are changing and if I have to trust anyone for job security, I think I'd rather put faith in myself! This book is a great start on the path to owning your own business! The examples are fun. Yes, it could be more detailed, perhaps a follow-up book?
B000FC10MU|4.0|In this book as in other Gaiman novels, the characters are the star.  The story is good and the settings are OK, but it really is his imagination with the characters that set him apart.  The two main characters, Shadow and Wednesday, both are complex and enjoyable.  The supporting cast is also really varied.  In turns spiteful, ethereal, crass, innocent, folksy, and crumudgeonly, the supporting characters are really rich and is the X factor in making this a really enjoyable read.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Outstanding characters; varied and imaginative<br />Though parts were predictable, I thought that the story in general lent itself to lots of surprises.<br />Really fun take on American culture, history, and folklore<br /><br />Meh:<br /><br />In this as in Neverwhere, the journey was better than the destination.  If you are looking for spectacular climaxes, this is not it.<br /><br />I really liked it and I think that others interested in general fantasy will as well.
B000002KKC|3.0|Fans will say more is better, but as an eval of an album, sometimes less is more and keeps the package offered tighter and flowing better musically.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Pros:<br />- Great material and quality speaks all around it.<br />- Huge space inside, a perfect for carry-on and travel.<br />- Room for clothing, laptop, iPad..<br /><br />Cons:<br />- the front pocket to hold newspaper and stuff keeps dangling if nothing is put in the there, making the bag shape look weird.<br />- Lot of pockets, but no keychain holder.  I would like to have a keychain holder where I can leave my keychain when leaving this house.<br />- Shoulder straps are stiff.  Workaround is to loosen the straps and don't put it on your back while the shoulder straps are too tight.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Perfect bag, very nice looking and made of quality material.  Good for frequent travelers who can stuff it with clothing and take it as a carry-on bag.  Roomy and will hold around 20-30 pounds of clothing.
B00008PW3Q|2.0|Talented musicians, of course, but you expect a certain sound and that is missing here with disparate attempts to recreate themselves for the times.

I hate it so much that when people ask me if we have a copy of it (I work in a library), I tell them that I wouldn't recommend it. And I just openly express how much I hate it!. I don't understand how this became a \\"Bestseller\\". Let's just say I could write better.... It had no plot... lots of hanky panky that got really boring quick!!!I really think someone was paid to help make this book a hit! I'm going to stop here because it really boils my blood that people even like this crap. There are other erotica novels far more entertaining than this!<br />I will end it here because I'm just wasting more precious time talking about this horrendous book!

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|First off, don't listen to the nay-sayers or the people who listened to the album one time and realized within minutes it wasn't the exact record they hoped Fiona would make for them. This isn't a work designed for the \\"instant-gratification\\" mindset. It's almost laughable to me to hear complaints about production. This record is actually very proper in it's production. I got as much $ in my system as many have in their cars and I can assure you this is a very dynamic recording. Her voice isn't buried in the backdrop like it was in the over-compressed \\"Extraordinary Machine\\". She is literally sitting in my living room. Her voice and piano alone could carry an album, and in this record it's almost down to those two...and it works beautifully.    This is not an over-compressed, over-produced cookie-cutter record to appease the simple-minded masses. This is a work of art straight from Fiona's heart. It's disappointing to hear self proclaimed fans who haven't the patience to give a record more than one spin, but will instead jump to snap judgement...and then proceed to try to rain on potential buyer's parades.    Upon my first listen or two, I knew this was different from previous releases. I gave it a spin a day. It really hit me that this is Fiona pouring her emotions out like never before. She is really letting loose and her voice sounds better than ever. The writing and creativity is superb. Im not going to go into a song by song breakdown. That is for the fan to experience on their own. I'm here to say that this is some of the most passionate, emotional work I have heard from this lovely woman...but it takes a little time to learn. Once you do, it is her really letting her inner self right out there, a very intimate record. She has grown by leaps and bounds and this album is a step forward.    Please enjoy...and thank you Fiona!
B007RC97L2|5.0|The self-titled debut album knocked my socks off, but the second album is just as strong, but in different ways.<br /><br />As original as the first album was, the band has changed a few things. The changes are subtle, but on the whole Panic is less about electro-swing and more about a distinctive Caravan Palace sound that has evolved away from the more obvious trademarks of the genre.<br /><br />The sonics are excellent and the energy is kinetic as all hell. This is great party music, or when you feel like a lift, or when you are driving around.<br /><br />Polished, catchy, and likeable. They deserve massive praise, these guys. The songs here show all the signs of great craftsmanship and taste, which ironically creates a sense of effortlessness.<br /><br />All hail Caravan Palace! One of my favourite bands now.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I'm a person who loves Austen but does not want to see the same version over and over with only the actors of the day changing. Yes, I appreciate the BBC version, but I also truly enjoyed this version because it takes some of the things in the background, some of the issues of the time, and inserts them into the movie. That said, this might have been easier if it were written and not so in-your-face- visual with these liberties (money from the sugar plantations, upstairs/downstairs with servents, bundling together to sleep and, of course, men can sleep with whomever they like would all be touched on). I'm of the mind that even a touch of Austen can only improve and deepen something (i.e. Clueless) and this film takes this and moves in the right direction. Not for purists but well done even if it's a bit in your face and in light of the new vampire/zombie Austen, perhaps even ahead of the time.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|DROPBOX<br />Having heard good things about this program from friends, I wanted to put it on my Kindle Fire.  Not offered by Amazon.  I read M. Marks review and decided to give it a try.  Go to dropbox dot com and download it to your PC and follow instructions on that site.  (I set up a couple of test files and placed into my dropbox on my PC.)  Then, on that site, locate Dropbox for Android.  Next, on your Fire, access that website and download the app from there onto your Fire (after following M. Marks instructions regarding allowing permission for external apps to be installed). Follow the rest of M. Marks instructions regarding installing Dropbox on your Fire.  Works like a charm, indeed!  Oh yes, Adobe Reader converts my Word files well.  Pictures display well.<br /><br />Amazon, please make this available to Kindle users.<br /><br />Luv, luv my Fire.  Good job Amazon!
B00007AJGH|5.0|This is a good movie. It was very funny and unfornutally the last thing Mel Blanc ever did but all good things have to come to an end sometime. As I said in my review for the Golden Collection of the Looney Tunes I was watching Space Jam with my brother and his wife and made the remark that it wouldve been better if Mel Blanc was still alive and then to my shock and surprise my brother explained to his wife who he was. I didnt know there was anyone around who didnt know who Mel Blanc was. Anyway this is a funny movie and you should get it.

0312641893|4.0|The premise of Cinder is something I think we can all get behind: a retelling of the fairytale Cinderella; only Cinderella is actually a cyborg mechanic, and the entire story is set in a futuristic dystopian society where people live in fear of a mysterious illness and the powerful and tyrannical race of people who live on the moon. It's no wonder Cinder has become one of the more popular debut Young Adult novels of the year.    While the novel does have a unique perspective, the heart of the story remains the same . The prince is charming, Cinder's step-family is horrid, and the ball is glamorous, but unlike the fairytale the characters are all fully realized, and much more complicated than they first appear. Cinder herself is an overtly humanizing element, despite being nearly 40 percent machine.    It's not often that we see \\"hard\\" science fiction written by and for women, but Marissa Meyer delivers just that. Cinder is easy to relate to, even if she is a gear head with a couple of metal limbs. The world itself is beautifully constructed, and its exposition is well integrated into the story; there are no boring paragraphs where we are given information that isn't connected immediately to what action is occurring in the story.    Marissa Meyer relies on simple and honest world building, character development, and a funny quirkiness instead of tricks and twists, with very pleasing results. Cinder is the first of a planned quartet, The Lunar Chronicles, and it does end on a bit of a cliff hanger. Fans will not get a resolution to that until the next novel in the series, Scarlet, which will be released in February of 2013. Some relief for the wait can be found on the author's website,[...] which includes some more background for her series, as well as a countdown clock for the next novel. Scarlet will be based on Red Riding Hood.    Meghan Drummond  Wovenmyst.com

0671027344|4.0|With the motion picture release of The Perks of Being a Wallflower on the horizon, it seemed like a great time to pick up a copy and give it a read. One of the most critically acclaimed Young Adult novels of our time, it remains a must read in the genre.<br />Charlie, our protagonist, is only fifteen and about to begin his freshman year of High School, an event he has a great deal of apprehension about following the suicide of one of his only friends from middle school. He quickly befriends Sam and Patrick, two upper classmen who become his closest friends.<br />One of the things that has distinguished this novel from many other Young Adult titles, is the honesty with which it presents itself. Charlie is a lens through which we see a cross section of teenagers from the early '90's. Charlie writes these revelations in a series of letters to a figure that he doesn't even know, but who he has been told is a forgiving and kind individual.<br />Through Charlie's letters we experience his first love, his first time with drugs, and the ordeals of his friends as they struggle through their travails. At times the book is uncomfortable in the way that adolescence is uncomfortable, and you'll find yourself shouting at Charlie what actions he should be taking only to watch him make blunder after blunder.<br />There's a reason this is one of the most treasure and quoted Young Adult novels of all time, and it's still worth a read. Some of the references, especially to music, might be dated, but the themes of friendship, isolation, and shared pain are applicable to every generation. The writing is lyrical, clever, and brutally insightful.<br /><br />MEGHAN DRUMMOND<br />Wovenmyst.com

B006RUJST6|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book-I thought it was going to be a teeny-bopper book. I was pleasantly surprised reading this! Although I can't personally realate to most of the tragedies the characters go through, I definitely felt what they felt while reading thjs book. It made me laugh, cry, and feel every emotion whih normally reading books don't affect me like that no matter how good it is. That's how good this was written. Although it is based kn an 18 year old and 21 year old, both characters were very mature.<br /><br />This is a great book for all ages in my opinion!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had to read the book to see what all the hype was about.  I have to agree with many of the reviews.  There was no real story, the characters were not well defined, the sex scenes aren't even close to believeable and as for erotica the author needs to read some of the greats (try Anne Rice's version).<br /><br />Many times I was just annoyed that the main character Ana (Anastasia, really?) was so guilable and had so little self respect until the very last pages of the book.  No, I would not bother to read the other two installments only to find out that she miraculously cures him of his fetishes by the love of a good woman (girl).<br /><br />It makes me sad that so many authors cannot get published and then you have something like this that becomes famous.
B004SUDQ72|5.0|I feel sorry for all the people that gave this movie bad reviews.  Unfortunately, they were randomly assigned character roles as unappreciative noobs.  In other words, they don't have the \\"free will\\" to overcome.

B008469DGY|5.0|love the control you have over the ball. I like the wind speeds that make the levels harder and more challenging.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|So basiclly long story short. This has more of a feel to it like A Thousand Suns.<br />Its not bad but its definitly not there old Hybrid Theory or Meteora.<br />More rapping (nothing against rap just telling you what to expect for like nine songs) and very little guitars but heavy on the electronic sounds.<br />There were plenty of songs that weren't bad at all but I really wouldn't spend money for the two songs that I liked.<br />The others were great and were written well theres no doubt about that just not my taste I guess. Your best bet, find a copy at your \\"used\\" cd store or some other place to find it and then see if you like it.<br />I know if I had a hard copy of this... I would've turned around and sold it back to the store.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|If I were to die and go to hell for my sins, my punishment would likely involve being forced to play the levels of this game over and over again for all eternity.  But much like the road to hell, this game starts off with the best intentions - find objects in cluttered scenes straight out of some reality show about hoarders - but then it asks you to do this task over and over again, looking for the same objects, differing only in the arbitrary rules applied to how you can search for them.  These \\"rules\\" seem to be a single-player adaptation of the Zynga playbook to pad out the gameplay.  But surprisingly, this is A-OK for maybe the first 10 levels and there's enough variety to carry those 10 levels.  Unfortunately there must be 50 or so such levels before the game's tedious conclusion.  And the final levels lack any sort of big gameplay reveal to make them special - just the same low contrast object hunt you've been doing to kill time since the beginning of the game..<br /><br />I got the game for free.  Thank god...<br /><br />Oh yeah, there are a few insipid minigames between the levels here and there.  And again, instead of an ever-expanding set of mini-games to reward progress, just the same 5 or so minigames, over and over and over again...

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have only made it to Chapter 9 and I am struggling to finish this book.  Anastasia is the most unbelievable character I have ever read.  She is a virgin who has never \\"really\\" kissed a man and then on top of that has never pleasured herself and her first round of sex with this guy she has 3 orgasms?  They have sex the first time and Christian just slams his penis into her hard and then tells her the first time he is going to F*** her hard and as a virgin she has an orgasm and no pain and he knows it is her first time.  That was just so I truly have no words to describe it.  The plot is bad and I agree with other reviewers that this looks like something a 17 year old wrote.  I am a fan of erotic romance but for this to get the hype it has received is beyond me.  I am going to try to finish but it may only be a chapter a day because I just cannot take how dumb this woman truly is.  I don't like to write bad reviews but this book should not be made into a movie.  Horrible just horrible.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This story is a breath of fresh air in a market full of indie drivel. I agree with the reviewer who said it is destined to become a sci-fi classic. This is a great book, I'm recommending it to all my friends, and am especially grateful to the friend who recommended it to me! I have had a hard time finding something good to read lately, and was very pleased when my friend recommended this book. I read the sample on Amazon, and was immediately pulled in. The writing style is engaging, and the subject matter compelling. I can't give 5 stars, I reserve those for books of Dune quality. I definitely believe the set of 5 should bring in more than $6.00. I would have paid $10 and am going to Mr. Howy's website to donate the other $4. Thanks for a fun read!
0375869026|5.0|When I saw this book on the 6th grade summer reading list, I thought it would be another boring book about middle school. Boy was I wrong. It is great. I'm so glad I read Wonder.<br /> Right from the first chapter, I was spellbound.  First, I enjoy how the author got different types of audiences into the book by combining action, pity and mystery into one book. That is very difficult to do.  Second, I like that the story contains different points of views.  A different person tells the story in each chapter. This way the reader knows what is going on in each character's head. The reader also learns what was happening behind a character's back. The third reason I love this book is that it has a great twist at the end. I think one of the best ways to end a book is with a surprising twist. That way the book really sticks in your head.<br /> As you can see, Wonder is a great book because the author appeals to different types of audiences, writes from different points of view, and ends the story with a great twist that you never saw coming. I hope whoever reads this review enjoys it and the book.
0800177177|1.0|The best thing about this film is the lush set design. The rest of the film was a hideous mess and not in a good way.  Neither Ryder nor Reeves could carry a British accent.  Gary Oldham's young Count looked like a thin version of PigPen from the Greatful Dead.  The film wanted to be a cross between the classic vampire tale and a Victorian porn novel.  The script was just silly.  Was unable to buy the eternal one story between the Count and Mena.  And why was Mena using a typewriter?  Lucy was portrayed with much scenery chewing as a HObag.  The saving grace of this film is that it allowed Mel Brooks to make \\"Dracula. Dead and Loving It.\\"  Skip the Coppola version and go straight to Brooks.

B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|The payed version doesnt seem like a good idea.. but the free version is great.. It basically isn't free because it is just missle command for free, but if you pay the 9.99 its worth it. 10 dollars for 100 atari games, and they are the best atari games.. This app allows older players to relive old memories without paying a quarter for every play, and allows younger players, like me, to play the original version of all the classic games you hear about. theres those plug n play games you see at walmart with the atari controller and 10 atari games, those usually include like 4 classics and 6 dumb games or something,  and cost like 20 - 30 dollars.. this allows you to get 100 games, including all the classics, and just for 10 dollars.. thats a good deal to me.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|This movie is pretty deep.  I saw some of the symbolism discussed in [[ASIN:0671682288 The Wisdom of Florence Scovel Shinn]], which lead me to see it again.  This was a major risk for Disney, their first full length cartoon, and it was state of the art, for its time.  They had adults waiting for blocks, to see this.  You see elements of the 1930's in this, yes, but it is also timeless.  It is a classic, as much as the Howard Hughes films that set the standard.  It also put Disney solidly in the black, and on the path to produce more.  This is a classic.
034580404X|5.0|Bought this set as an early birthday present for myself after hearing the buzz. I selected 2 day shipping at only $12 which is very inexpensive. It arrived in only ONE day! I was so happy. Wrapped very well and the box set makes it very easy to continue with the next book instead of buying each one individually. I'm already half way through the first book and I must say it's as good as everyone claims!
B005LAIGNC|5.0|Stories are a way of assigning meaning to phenomena.  This is not a complete story of the Red Tails, but it is a good sampling.  It has all the mythic elements, as in [[ASIN:0941188132 The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers & Screenwriters]] and [[ASIN:1577314042 The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell)]].  There is a death and a rebirth.  There is a woman.  The pilot's huts were real.  This movie is a gem, in its way.  They had to have done CGI Messerschmidt 262's, and I guess also the other planes, however it seemed state of the art, to me.  My father was in the Army Air Force.  I didn't see any technical mistakes, well maybe a purist might have, but I didn't.  The P-40's in the early scenes were right on.  I found this movie well made, and satisfying.

1594203059|5.0|Civilization by Niall Ferguson addresses the most important topic of our time. Empires rise and fall. The American empire took over from the British between the two wars. It did so on the basis of economic along with military might which underpin all empires. It is tautological that all empires before America's have declined into senescence. Is this now happening to America? Is western civilization in its final stages? Civilization gives much insight on this topic. The up-and-coming empire that may or may not supplant western civilization is that of China. China - the Middle Kingdom - was the reigning empire before the year 1500. To fathom the future of something as complex as that of empire it is vital to look back and understand why empires in the past have risen and fallen. Ferguson does journeyman's work on this.<br /><br />The preface is worth the price of admission. It is notable that the top business economist of the second half of the 20th century, Henry Kaufman of Solomon Brothers fame, induced Ferguson to move from London to the center of money and power, Manhattan. If America is going down, its decline will be dated from the epicentral destruction of Manhattan's twin towers. The value of the US dollar - also highly symbolic - peaked a few short months later, that is, historically coincident with. The closely following collapse of US financial markets in 2008 and the torpid recovery since, including the imploding financial system of Europe, puts the rise of China and relative fall of western civilization in high relief. In his preface, Ferguson gives a wonderful explication of how history - a living past - can help us discern possible futures so as to make better decisions today. He quotes in detail the thought process of R.G. Collingwood. History offers something different from scientific rules, namely insight. \\"The key point of the book is to understand what made ... [western] civilization expand so spectacularly in its wealth, influence, and power.\\" This, as Ferguson emphasizes, requires telling the story with analytics, evidence, and testable counterfactual questions. By such methodology Ferguson arrives at six crucial innovations by which in his view western civilization climbed to the top, and which are the heart of the book.<br /><br />In his introductory chapter, Ferguson quashes the modernist absurdity of relativism - that all civilizations are in some sense equal. He does so by introducing a number of nonpareil concepts like life expectancy across time and place, the economic system, and non-economic institutions, all of which dynamically over time differentiated western civilization from the rest of the world during the relevant timespan. He then lays out what he believes are the mainsprings of the West's rise - six \\"novel complexes of institutions and associated ideas and behaviors\\": Competition, Science, Property Rights, Medicine, The Consumer Society, and The Work Ethic. These are the subjects of chapters 1-6.<br /><br />The difficulty of conceptualizing a work like this lies in finding an Archimedean-like place far enough removed to get leverage on the trees so as to reveal the breadth and nature of the forest as well as the species of trees that make it up. This ability, though it is not normally put this way, is why we revere Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Gibbon, Adam Smith and statesmen like Gandhi and Churchill and Deng Xiaoping. They got their arms around big things and moved the world of ideas. Not every thought has to be original, and not every tree has to be (or indeed can be) put under the lens. What matters is that the kaleidoscope of world view gets shifted to make more sense out of what is otherwise chaos. Civilization has changed my view of the world by giving me a concrete set of pegs on which to hang the various aspects of causality in my quest to understand empire.  Competition is the sine qua non of free market economics. How can it not be that the dynamic effect of competition amongst thesplintered states of Europe from 1500 on was a powerful force moving western civilization forward? Of course competition was not a sufficient force, it took more. Gutenberg's printing press set off the intellectual revolution (innovation) that led to the scientific method (Chapter 2). Of course sanctity of the individual's right to own Property (Chapter 3) is at the motivational heart of saving that permits accumulation of capital, which in turn is a necessary means of production to grow an economy. The East has adopted capitalism now, no matter that it be called something else, and is surging economically since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the spread of globalism. Western medicine (Chapter 4) has made all the difference to life span. It's hardly a stretch to think it was a game changer for the West. And, there is more (of a secondary nature) in this chapter on how colonization by Europe, which had its down side, also had a powerful upside on many peoples outside the West via the travels of medicine.  Consumption (Chapter 5) is an odd one, and it is thought provoking to view this largest component of GDP from Ferguson's perspective. I did not realize that textiles were the main industrial product at first in England and then synchronously at the take-off stage of every country which has gotten on the up escalator thereafter. China as well. You can almost predict textile production will at some point come to the Congo. And you will never look at a pair of jeans the same way again after reading Civilization. Work (Chapter 6) goes without saying. Ferguson gets you thinking about how the work ethic in America is slipping, even more so in Europe, and how statistically work effort is almost in a different ballpark in the East (they work more hours). This has implications for the future of empire, and from the broadest of contexts points to policy implications about work incentives here in America. This frame should be a starting point for thinking about the welfare state and optimal taxation of work effort. Ferguson puts his sixth finger squarely on it. I leave his conclusion for to the reader to discover. Highly recommended with 5 stars.

6304712936|5.0|\\"That doesn't really work, does it?\\" says Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as he plays a march of welcome written by court composer Antonio Salieri. Within a minute, he has turned a labored little tune which took much time and effort into what would become the \\"Non piu andrai\\" March from his seemingly controversial opera The Marriage of Figaro. As he ends it with a childish three-note melody, he produces a high-pitched giggle which will ring in both Salieri's and the audiences' ears forever.<br /> The bitterness and jealousy of Salieri towards Mozart is the subject of Milos Forman's brilliant film \\"Amadeus\\", which explores not just the greatness of Mozart's music but the mediocrity of Salieri's. One of the most enduring lines in the movie is Salieri's question to the priest who is hearing his confession: \\"Why would God put the lust to compose in my body and then deny me the talent?\\" He recognizes Mozart not only as a miraculous composer, but also as an undeserving brat.<br /> One of the most interesting sequences in the movie is when Salieri goes to a concert of Mozart's in Vienna to seek him out. He notices a young man and woman rolling around on the floor speaking obscenities backwards. But when the young man hears his music being played without his presence, Salieri immediately begins to despise Mozart, describing him as a dirty creature.<br /> There are several strengths to \\"Amadeus\\": the strongest is the performance by F. Murray Abraham as the jealous court composer. Every movement by Abraham is a master stroke of acting. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor as this role, and it is no surprise. As a man who loved music but simply lacked the talent, Salieri was a man of incredible depth with several conflicts.<br /> Playing opposite Abraham is Tom Hulce as one of the greatest geniuses of all time. But as \\"Amadeus\\" shows, Mozart did not take his talent for granted. Instead, he used it as a crutch as he highly criticized and made fun of other composers. The funniest scene in the movie (did I happen to mention that this movie is hilarious) is when Salieri is spying on Mozart at a party where the latter is being asked requests to play music from other composers. After he performs the music of Bach, he turns down requests for such composers as Handel, giving the excuse \\"I don't like him\\". In disguise, Salieri requests for his own music. Mozart describes it as a challenge to play Salieri. But as he plays, he starts making fun of Salieri's physical output and the hard work that the court composer put into making the music.<br /> Another one of my favorite elements of the film is the costume design. The costume as well as the art direction and set pieces help to make \\"Amadeus\\" one of the greatest films set in 18th century Europe.<br /> But aside from the comic humor and design, this is a film about forgiveness. As we are shown in the beginning scenes, Salieri feels that Mozart's death was his fault. His flashback is the amazing story of how he knew Mozart and how the music has affected him.<br /> The scene where Salieri assists Mozart in writing the Requiem Mass is the best in the movie. As Mozart's health decreases, he struggles to get his last thoughts on the music transcribed by Salieri. When his wife and son return home in the morning, Mozart is barely breathing and as pale as ever. His wife locks away the music and forces Salieri out. As this happens, Mozart dies.<br /> As we see Salieri's character develop, we see that in time he grows to be content with the fact that his music will never match up to Mozart's. He deems himself \\"the patron saint of mediocrity.\\"ene in the movie (did I happen to mention that this movie is hilarious) is when Salieri is spying on Mozart at a party where the latter is being asked requests to play music from other composers.

The reason is because you can't figure the route it taking.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Top quality animation is a painstaking process, but in the 1930s, it was a newfound discovery and an exciting adventure for Walt Disney and his team of animators. Yes, there had been other animated features and short cartoons even in color before it; but there was never a full-blown exciting mix of drama, comedy, terror, imagination, and music before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Roger Ebert has said that every animated feature since owes something to the first Disney animated feature. And he was absolutely right, for the vast majority of animated features use much of the same \\"revolutionary style and invention\\" as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The attention to detail in this film is a topic I could talk about for hours (what other film do you know that has a turtle painfully climbing up each stair one at a time?)<br /><br />The tale of Snow White has been told for generations and perhaps centuries, the most famous of which is the version by the Brothers Grimm, and it was from this version that Disney decided to make his first feature length film. The story is quite simplistic, no doubt. I won't go into it because it's hard to imagine anyone over the age of 4 who doesn't know the essentials of the story. But that's not what the attention is laid on in the film; what matters once again is the attention to detail. Another film about Snow White can be made these days that has the merely the characters, recycled dialogue from children's storybooks, and the story in its simplest form; the film would be forgotten almost instantly upon its release.<br /><br />I would argue that Walt Disney thought the exact same thing: you can take a fantasy and turn it into a timeless classic with the right amount of attention to detail. Take, for example, the scene just before Snow White's scary adventure in the forest: she tells a baby blue bird who has lost its parents to not be afraid. As the book \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: the Art and Creation of Walt Disney's Classic Animated Film\\" tells, one early idea was for the bird to have a broken wing or to be pursued by a larger bird. But this was discarded in favor of the version seen in the film, a subtler approach to illustrate Snow White's situation.<br /><br />The book also shows how scenes from an animated film are made. Before this, I had a sense of how they were made, but reading the book was extraordinarily useful in figuring out the process: a layout design is prepared on pencil and paper as a set for a scene, similar to the construction of a set in live action films. After that, the backgrounds are colored over in painting (unlike a good majority of the subsequent Disney animated features, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs used watercolors instead of gouache and oil paintings as seen in its successor, Pinocchio.).<br /><br />When the setting is established, animators then make drawings of their respective characters. Once the action of the character is approved, the drawings are then enhanced by cleanup drawings before they are taken over to be painted and placed into the cels. And if that weren't enough, twenty-four frames have to cover one second of action. That's part of the reason why animation is so difficult. Even when a scene like Snow White instructing the animals to put the dwarves' dishes in the tube instead of stacking them lasts a few seconds, that's an amount of hard work that is often unmatched by today's computers.<br /><br />I have thus far been talking about the process of the animation, so I might answer the question: why does it matter? In the case of a fairy-tale like Snow White, it is often wiser to present the story in animation form, as opposed to live action. Again, I must place emphasis on attention to detail and the importance of discovery: the amount of supporting characters that surround Snow White, the Queen, and the Prince are larger than you could think; not only are the Seven Dwarfs given so much care, but also the animals, the trees, the backgrounds, and even the rain that supports the climax of the film. (Disney however, wouldn't get the movement of animals completely right until Bambi, where the attention to detail in animal movement is scary, not to mention The Lion King.)<br /><br />The music in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also makes for both feel-good and frightening experiences: the songs by Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, and Larry Morey, while somewhat simplistic, are absolutely stunning in their memorable melodies and charming lyrics (\\"Heigh-Ho\\" and \\"Whistle While You Work\\" merit the most attention). Paul Smith, on the other hand, is able to create a score that has the sense of discovery and terror at the same time.<br /><br />The attention given to the Dwarfs illustrate arguably the most memorable and (in Dopey's case) comedic aspects of the film. Each one is a brilliant little masterpiece, exhibiting a distinct range of personalities and facial expressions. The hero of these creations is unquestionably Grumpy, with the great animator Vladimir Tytla giving his character an arc more entertaining and more exciting than most seen in animated features today. Consider the scene where the Dwarfs leave the cottage for a day's worth of digging in the mine: Grumpy calls Snow White's kissing disgusting, and yet he cleans his forehead in a mirror and even clears his throat loudly for her attention. Before the end, she ends up kissing him on the forehead and he storms off. But he slows down, sighs with relief, and gives his first genuine smile of the whole film. He turns back to wink at the princess, who blows him a kiss and waves. Realizing she got the best of him, he tries to act tough, but ends up making a fool of himself. His arc is complete at the end of the film when he leads the Dwarfs in rescuing Snow White from the Queen.<br /><br />Good gracious, have I even spoken of the Queen yet? Well, let's bring it to here: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1937, only two years before The Wizard of Oz. I have stated in the past that the Wicked Witch of the West may be the stereotype for witches in years to come, but look to the Wicked Queen or her terrifying alter-ego, the Old Hag, of the animated film: how many similarities can you draw between the two characters? My guess is that MGM took influence from Disney's film to create their own villain. But the Wicked Witch of the West still hasn't got a patch on a woman who demands a young girl's heart in a box.<br /><br />Norm Ferguson, a young animator at the time, was in charge of the design of the Old Hag, and I must thank him for it: for I was terrified of the film for many years, and his design of the monstrous woman is why. But I also must give credit to Lucille LaVerne, the voice actress of both characters: she simply changed voices by removing her false teeth. I would guess that she had the teeth in for the elegant tones of the Queen, and out for the cackling rasps of the Witch.<br /><br />If Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had not been a fantasy, there wouldn't be a need for attention to detail, and the events at the end of the story wouldn't make sense. But since it is a fantasy, the Disney story men and artists totally engulfed themselves in it. Ward Kimball, one of the Nine Old Men, said in 2000 \\"I still think it's the best thing we ever did.\\" It's ironic that he would say that, because some of his sequences were removed from the final product. (He stayed at Disney because of the offer to supervise Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio.) While I disagree with his opinion, I cannot deny that it is one of the most beautiful animated movies in history, and there is also no denying its influence. Along with Pinocchio and Fantasia, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had a sense of discovery and a burst of imagination that has almost virtually been unequaled by anything in the realm of animation.s, and even the rain that supports the climax of the film.

B004EPZ08Y|1.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />First it was a plane explosion, then a massive highway wreck, followed by rollercoaster disaster, then a Formula one race demolition, now after running out of any somewhat good ways to open the film we have a bridge collapsing and some people escaping who were supposed to die. So like the previous Final Destination films these people are naturally doomed to die in silly and elaborate ways.<br /><br />A young man named Sam starts getting a creepy feeling once he gets on a bus for a company retreat, said bus heads over the a high up bridge part of which is under some major construction. So its only natural a man with concrete saw somehow sets off a chain reaction of cracks and eventually leads to the collapse of the massive structure.<br /><br />The rest of the film is a series of death scenes and the usual banter about how you can't cheat death. Tony Todd makes his appearance as a mortician who talks about what they must do to survive. After the great first film, decent second, so-so third and terrible fourth we can put this one somewhere between the third and fourth flick.<br /><br />Number 5 isn't so terrible that it bears tons of scorn, however its not too much above receiving some scorn as it features a fairly unfamiliar and very one dimensional cast. Besides some office nerd who survives the opening sequence there isn't really one villain to loathe but no one the viewer wishes would live in the end.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert (Stop reading if you don't want to know anything major)<br /><br />The tie in to the events of the first film just felt so forced, I was literally shaking my head from the moment I saw them on the plane. It just was a really, really loose way to tie it all together. *1/2 out of 4 stars.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|It's quite interesting that even though Marlon Brando's heroic performance as Stanley Kowalski is recognized as one of the most influential pieces of acting on the silver screen, he was the only one of the four main actors not to win an Oscar for \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\". While Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden all picked up Oscars, Brando's went to Humphrey Bogart for \\"The African Queen\\". But throughout time, of the two, Brando's has been the more revered and respected.<br /> Elia Kazan doesn't tinker around much with Tennessee Williams' classic stage play, but instead, he keeps it straight to the text. The dialogue is nearly the same as it was in the play itself, and all Kazan does is give life to the characters and the locations. Shot in beautiful black-and-white, \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" deals with the harsh realities of forgetting the past and throwing away dreams.<br /> The best scenes in the movie of course involve Marlon Brando, without whom the film could not have worked. As Stanley Kowalski, he plays the wife-beater/alcoholic straight as it should be played. At times he can be the most charming man in the world, and at others he can be the most dangerous. One of my very favorite scenes in the film is the miserable birthday party that Stella (Hunter) throws for Blanche (Leigh). As Blanche asks Stanley to tell a story, he sits there, licking his greasy fingers, at which Stella gets angry and demands that he wash himself and help her clear the table.<br /> At that moment, Stanley smashes his glass to the floor, frightening his wife and sister-in law. He begins a courageous and male-domination speech that I could probably quote for memory: \\"Now that's how I'm gonna clear the table. Don't you ever talk that way to me! Pig, Polack, Disgusting, Vulgar, Greasy. Those kinds of words have been on you and your sister's tongues too much around here. Who do you think you are, a pair of queens? Just remember what Huey Long said, that every man is the king, and I'm the king around here. And don't you forget it.\\"<br /> With that one speech, Stanley is already defined as a character as intimidating as Darth Vader himself. And some of the scariest moments in the film include his drunken scenes and his final confrontation with his sister-in-law.<br /> Of the many great things in \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\", after Marlon Brando, my next favorite is Vivien Leigh's performance as Blanche Dubois. After her spellbinding performance in \\"Gone With the Wind\\", Leigh retook her claim as the great actress of the time with another performance as a Southern Belle. You could have dyed Scarlett o' Hara's hair blonde and put her in a time machine that went into the 1930's and there wouldn't be a difference in the world between her and Blanche.<br /> The character of Blanche Dubois is already flawlessly written, but Leigh gives her the power of Scarlett o' Hara. Her scenes with Karl Malden as Stanley's best friend Mitch are quite interesting as she tries to impress him with lies. She likes to keep the light out of her face to make her seem younger. But in time, Mitch sees through her fabrications and finds her to be a desperate alcoholic.<br /> Karl Malden and Kim Hunter give their supporting characters of Mitch and Stella excitement. Every time they appear on the screen with Brando and Leigh, they are not minions to the lead actors, but their counterparts. Their supporting performances are what make \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" one of the best ensembles ever assembled at the movies.<br /> But what does the film symbolize? For me, it stands for the passion between characters who feel unchallenged. Before Blanche came along, Stanley was content. He had a nice life with a pretty wife, a good job, and good friends. When Blanche arrived at his door, his life turned upside down. I believe that he had a physical/sexual attraction towards Blanche and he couldn't control it at the very end.<br /> And while he does feel this physical bond with her, Stanley begins to see her as a fraud. He begins to antagonize her, even going so far as to buy her a ticket back to Laurel (Oriole) as a birthday gift. He looks to himself as the king, and that everyone is at his command.<br /> Blanche sees throughout time that her past with her ex-husband and affair with a 17-year old boy come back to haunt her. These two events will trigger the ending of the film, which is incredibly painful, as she is lead away to a mental institution, but not before uttering \\"I have always depended on the kindness of strangers\\". Your past will always be with you, whether it haunts you or teaches you lessons.nley begins to see her as a fraud.

B006P0FICE|4.0|Another movie version of \\"The Three Musketeers\\", how refreshing and how utterly tedious of an idea. The Musketeers successfully pull off a heist they are betrayed by Milady (Milla Jovovich, \\"The Resident Evil\\" franchise) and the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" franchise).<br /><br />So as we all know the Musketeers must reband together, they gain the help of D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman, \\"Percy Jackson and The Olympians: The Lightning Thief\\"), go through to the country and France and bring peace. Of course they must also fight in some good fight sequences, have some good banter and keep the pace of the film going along good even though this has all been told, retold and re-retold many times before.<br /><br />At least this one has some flare to it and a good cast, Bloom is the usual cheesy and unsavory villain as The Duke, Jovovich is simply stunning, Lerman makes for a good young hero and the Musketeers are entetaining also. As stated before the action sequences are well done, the action doesn't get anymore overblown than your standard action movie and well its mindless entertainment. Its not what I call great or even very good, but its decent and lively enough not to be too boring throughout. **1/2 out of 4 stars.

B005TTEFRG|1.0|Remakes have been happening for a good long time, partly cause the technology is better so they can have bigger sets and better special effects and also partly cause Hollywood has been running out of original ideas. So enter this remake of the 1982 Arnold swords and sorcery epic \\"Conan: The Barbarian\\" where a young man named Conan (Jason Momoa, HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\") is born on a battlefield and is raised by his dad (Ron Perlman, \\"Hellboy\\") to be a great warrior.<br /><br />So after going on a test with some young soon to be warriors Conan is attacked by and kills a few savages, then soon after an army of these savages and their new leader Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang, \\"Avatar\\") attack Conan's village and his dad ends up dead. Zym is looking for bone fragments of an ancient bone mask that if pieced back together would give the person wearing it great power.<br /><br />After seeing his dad die Conan embarks on a vengeance sparked quest to avenge his father, but soon learns he must help lead the rest of the warrior nations against the bloodthirsty leader before he can reassemble the mask. There's lots of blood, fighting, more blood, a little good natured slave freeing, monsters and well you know how these type of movies go.<br /><br />Initially its basic and bare bones action and dialogue, however it does quickly become quite dull and hollow even as the blood flies and the body count multiplies. Momoa is at the very least a hulking presence and makes a good action hero, even if he's little more than a meat head.<br /><br />The rest of the cast includes Rachel Nichols (\\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\"), Rose McGowan (\\"Scream\\") and Bob Sapp (\\"Elektra\\" and a former K-1 competitor), so at least there's one attractive woman to gain the attention of the male viewer in between action sequences (I'd normally say two but Rose looks bizarre as Zym's daughter). But the film honestly gets very tiresome after the second or third fight segment, and most people will probably want the credits to roll long before the film ends. * out of 4 stars.dits to roll long before the film ends. * out of 4 stars.

B005LAIH5O|2.0|After the great special effects laiden but terribly done remake of \\"Clash of the Titans\\", it was expected a sequel would come. Now with \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" it has, in this flick Perseus (Sam Worthington, \\"Man on a Ledge\\") is asked by his father Zeus (Liam Neeson, \\"Taken\\") to help the gods before Hades (Ralph Finnes, \\"Red Dragon\\") releases the Titans from the underworld and they along with their demonic leader Kronos can wage war on the earth and the heavens.<br /><br />Thats about it for the story, the sets are lush and impressive, and much like \\"Clash\\" there's not a lot of good acting (which honestly isn't what people go to these movies for). A few other characters in the cast are Ares (Edgar Ramirez, \\"Vantage Point\\"), Agenor (Toby Kebbell, \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\") and Queen Andromeda (The beautiful Rosamund Pike, \\"Die Another Day\\"). As we all know with these type of movies, the main focus is the action and special effects which are the only good parts of the film. The creatures are impressive especially Kronos but like the Krakken in \\"Clash\\" it makes a big splash but isn't on for long.<br /><br />Of course if you don't turn your brain off before watching this you'll be bored 10 minutes in, sadly I did this and it still got boring. This should've been called \\"Wraith\\" not \\"Wrath\\" cause any tension, suspense or caring for the characters is as transparent as a Wraith. \\"Immortals\\" to me was a perfect example of how to do a swords/sorcery/gods themed movie, \\"Clash\\" missed the mark and \\"Wrath\\" does also. So \\"Wrath\\" is great to look at but just so hollow. *1/2 out of 4 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game though it could be easier to earn acorns. I don't brleleive in spending real money just to play a game and had to impute the parental controls so my kids couldn't purchase anything by mistake.
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|Spy flicks are usually a mixed bag, some good, some great, some ok and some just plain awful, usually if a good cast and director are involved more often than not they fall under the great or at least good category. \\"Haywire\\" has director Steven Soderbergh (\\"Traffic\\" and \\"Ocean's Eleven\\") at the helm who brings his talents to an otherwise typical story of a black-ops agent named Mallory (Gina Carano, Former MMA Star) who rescues a hostage and is given a job that leads to her being (gasp) betrayed by someone close to her.<br /><br />So naturally she must fight back and use her training and skills to find out who betrayed her and well take them out for lack of a better word. Since this is her first major film role, its good that Soderbergh put together an all-star supporting cast with her. Among them are Ewan McGregor (The new \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy), Antonio Banderas (\\"The Mask of Zorro\\" and \\"Shrek 2\\"), Bill Paxton (\\"Twister\\" & \\"Frailty\\"), Michael Douglas (\\"Basic Instinct\\" & \\"The Sentinel\\") and others really add some pep to this flick.<br /><br />The music by David Holmes also really fits the movie, its stylish and really soothing and also jolting when it has to be but it doesn't overpower the movie. The story while simple is well done thanks to the layered cast, the previously mentioned music, Soderbergh's direction and to me Carano shines here as she's not given way too much to do but looks equal parts tough and very, very beautiful. I literally couldn't take my eyes off of her throughout the movie.<br /><br />Is it a perfect movie? No of course not, but it is quite fun and really helped out by all the good parts involved. *** out 4 stars.

B0068RHSZO|1.0|A husband named Will Atenton (Daniel Craig, \\"Quantum of Solace\\") decides to up and quit a Manhatten job, move to a whole new place in the New England countryside with his wife (Rachel Weisz, \\"The Mummy\\"), their two daughters and everything seems just dandy. But of course its not as their new house was once where a few murders took place of a mother and her children. So naturally their spirits haunt the house and Will sees them.<br /><br />Troubled by this Will decides to look into the murders and see if these ghosts are real or if they somehow tie into his troubled past (would it be a thriller if he didn't have one?). Also in the cast is Naomi Watts as Ann, the neighbor who seems to have clues to help Will with his search.<br /><br />The film is fairly or rather very short, under 90 minutes before the credits roll. At first its decently paced, there's some good build-up and the way its presented it does make you question whether its imaginary or very real on Will's part. Unfortunately this good portion doesn't last long as it gets silly as it goes on.<br /><br />Which is expected and thank god great actors like Craig, Watts and Weisz are included in this to give it some punch. But sadly the build-up doesn't lead to much, the twists are umm..... strange, not really chilling and get quite silly towards the end. The movie starts out ok but it kinda just fizzles out and stumbles to its conclusion. *1/2 out of 4 stars.

B006H8BIIM|5.0|First all, I went through several super negative reviews and I almost decided not to get this game, but I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Yes, you \\"paid\\" to get the game and yes it does allow you to spend 0.99 cents to get all possible upgrades. But that's it. It's not going to charge you to train or move to the next mission. I played the game for about 2 hours yesterday and I'm already half way through the missions and I've unlocked both Survival and Mining Modes. In Mining mode you can easily make 500-600 credits in 10-15 minutes. There is only 1 weapon that's more expensive than 500 credits - the Proton Torpedo (2000):) If you play mining mode 2-3 times, you can easily purchase all weapons and you can start upgrading your buildings etc.<br /><br />Here are some tips:<br />1) You can re-play all missions that you've passed for additional credits. It gives you less credits than the first time you played, but it's an easy way to earn credits and progress<br />2) I find all mining missions to be relatively easy. You don't really need to buy too many weapons, you just need to build a lot of miners to gather the required amount of resources before the big guys come for a visit. After a couple of tries I can finish mission 6 \\"Mine 5000 minerals\\" in 3-4 minutes or less.<br />3) Use the speed up button. Once you're all set in the mining missions you can just hit the speed up button and watch a movie or something:) lol<br /><br />So, I think that this is a fun game! :)

0439023513|3.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book.  Overall, I liked the story and the direction it went.  It made sense.  Unlike some here, I understood/appreciated the ending and was glad it wasn't a fairy tale where everything ended hunky-dory.  That would not have fit the books at all.  The problem was that the writing sometimes bogged the story down.<br /><br />At the beginning, I was very annoyed with Katniss because she was being dumb...I understand this is a general statement and that as a character, she has a right to do whatever, but the problem was that it did not seem to me to fit her character...it was almost like it was an out-of-body experience.  I didn't understand why she would have a feud with Haymitch.  They understand each other and she is smarter than the way she is portrayed in the first few chapters of the book.  But that was a minor problem.<br /><br />I think the big downer for me was a lack of detail, especially as they were fighting their way to the Capitol.  In the first two, I could picture everything and see what was happening.  During this sequence, everything felt so rushed that I just did not have a good picture of what was going on.  Maybe that was intentional to give the feeling that Katniss might have been having, but it did not feel that way.<br /><br />All in all, this book is definitely different from the first two.  The last two I was engrossed in and had trouble putting down.  This one I still had trouble putting down, but mainly just because I wanted to see how everything ended, not because the book kept me super interested.  Maybe I'll like it better if I read through the series again.  We'll see.  It's a good book, but it could have been better.
B0088TG252|4.0|Of course with it being a Denzel movie the plot is usually the same; he's presumed dirty/really bad S.O.B. but turns out to be a good guy all along. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time with the split second changes in direction for the characters. In some of the plot, the build was almost foreseeable until the end. It may have been different for other reviewers. I am trying not to be a spoiler so I'm trying to be vague, but show my love of this movie. The soundtrack throughout was also spot on. But who watches a movie for the soundtrack, right?! Enjoy; and make your own opinion!

B0085A9J18|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater I knew this was not your basic run of the mill type of action martial arts movie compared to all the others I have seen. This was special in the sense that the brutality of it sets it apart from many others I have seen. The fight scenes are very realistic. Like others have mentioned there's not much of a plot, but with this kind of action movie you really don't need one. There is a couple of surprises though. There's gunfights and other weaponry that makes this movie more exciting also. I really thought that the music score went perfectly with the action.  I have to say this has to be the best martial art action movie I have ever seen and that's probably why I have seen it in the theater about - well, I lost count after 5 times! I would recommend any martial art action fan to see this. The director gets an A+!!!
B00692ASTQ|5.0|I must preface this review by saying that I am a big fan of Coldplay.  I own every major album that they have released and some of the lesser known EPs.  As with any artist, there are some songs like I like better than others, but they seem to have this knack for producing an album that flows together really nicely.  The short, instrumental transition pieces that they have started to include add to this sense of flow.<br /><br />Mylo Xyloto had tough shoes to fill, following on the heels of Viva La Vida, which was truly one of Coldplay's finest works, in my opinion.  Following the band through their website, Twitter and Facebook, it was obvious that they put a lot of thought and hard work into pushing their own boundaries a bit with this record.  I believe that they delivered a great album as a result.  When I first heard Princess of China on the radio, I had a difficult time believing it was Coldplay.  Don't get me wrong, most of the album still has that sound that Coldplay is famous for, but they have managed to put a bit of a different flavor and feel into many of the tracks.<br /><br />And now here is where I get to plug the Special Edition product.  I grabbed this while it was on special, but I was looking at it before then.  The chance to buy the album on vinyl, along with the extras of copies of Chris' notes and journaling from the time while they were in the studio and while he was dreaming some of this album up, was too hard to resist, especially when it went on sale.  The one thing that concerns me is that the vinyl fits in its sleeve VERY snugly.  Then again, vinyl isn't as susceptible to scratching as CDs.  That said, when I do get my turntable running, I may find another way of storing the vinyl for this album.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a fan of Coldplay, this album is worth a listen.  By this time, you've likely already heard several of the singles that have been released.  If you like them, buy the album.  If you are a really big fan of Coldplay and have some extra cash, buy the special edition as a gift to yourself.  And if you ever get a chance to see them live, DO IT.  They are phenomenal live.

B007R3BB7Y|5.0|After redefining the piano trio on a series of albums for Riverside, Bill Evans had his musical foil taken from him with the 1961 car accident that killed bassist LaFaro. Perhaps most difficult was that LaFaro's death came less than two weeks after the trio made their tour de force stand at the Village Vanguard, as subsequently memorialized on the albums [[ASIN:B001D6OKJ2 Sunday at the Village Vangaurd]] and [[ASIN:B003YOMN68 Waltz for Debby]]. Evans withdrew from performing for several months before reemerging in 1962, with Chuck Israels filling the bass slot, with this album of ballads. The interplay of the previous trio is still to be heard, but Evans piano, pensive but not moody, steps more assertively forward. Israels' warm tone provides a soothing bottom end for Evans' rhythmic chords and solo flights, and Paul Motian's drumming, particularly in the sparser passages, keeps Evans moving without pushing the tempos. This is a beautifully expressive album from start to finish. [©2012 Hyperbolium]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stopped watching ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX when reality TV came out. Oh... I like my TV but I had no interest in Survivor or Big Brother or American Idol (long live Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Burn Notice, Suits, Royal Pains, etc.). So Suzanne Collins took a TV genre I loath and wrote a book that takes place within such a TV genre.

I was stunned (impressed) that an author could make a teen-book centered on the slaughter of 23 children. Impressive... Creative... Brilliant....

1594202842|4.0|When I was a freshman at Stanford in the late '90s I was enrolled in SLE, taking 20 units, working a part-time job, and feverishly following a tight budget. (This was before Stanford rolled out their extensive financial aid packages of today that would have helped me afford taking the full four years to graduate instead of three.) But back to my frosh year... the one class I took \\"for fun\\" was Opera 101, because I have always been fascinated by opera.<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite college memories was coming to class one morning a bit early, and being blessed to hear Professor Stephen Hinton and his TA Keith, play an impromptu piano and violin duet at 8:45 in the morning. It was a musical treat that to this day still inspires me. I remember thinking at that moment while I was sitting in the lecture hall listening to music \\"I love learning and the pain of accomplishing all of this is worth it.\\"<br /><br />My freshman roommate, let's call her Mary, has some different memories from that year. She was an only child to parents who had emigrated from Asia. In retrospect, I realize she was also the product of a \\"Tiger Mom\\" upbringing reminiscent of Amy Chua.<br /><br />Brilliant, creative, and also a gifted pianist, Mary got to college and had a lot of big problems. Her parents tried to pick out her classes. Her parents tried to pick out her major. Her mother would call at 1 AM in the morning (4AM East coast time) to see if Mary was in her room studying. Mary didn't have to work a part time job and stick to an exhausting academic  schedule in the hopes of graduating a year early due to cost like I did, but she did have to deal with her parents.<br /><br />By Winter quarter, Mary had shaved her head and people in our dorm started getting concerned. By Spring, she was hearing voices, lost, found by the police, put under lock and key at Stanford's mental hospital, sedated, and taken home to the East Coast.<br /><br />When her dad came to help me pack up Mary's belongings and close down her side of the room, we realized that she had lofted her bunk bed without tightening the screws. It had been a miracle that Mary hadn't been hurt because she literally had screws loose. In spite of all of her academic knowledge, Mary didn't understand \\"righty-tightly, lefty-loosely\\".<br /><br />This brings me back to Opera 101. In that class I learned about the horrible history of \\"Castrati\\". These were young boys whose parents had castrated them in the hopes of becoming famous opera singers one day. There are actual parts in opera that today need to be sung by women, since castrati no longer exist. In many ways, parents of castrati were the \\"Tiger Moms\\" of their day, and vice versa.<br /><br />Some people might look at my Afterschooling page on my blog, \\"Teachingmybabytoread\\", and think \\"Tiger Mom Alert!\\", but that's a very flawed comparison. If you actually read Amy Chua's book, you will see that The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a journey. The beginning of Chua's parenting journey is reminiscent of my roommate Mary's experience. Where Chua ends on this journey, is probably very similar to my own parenting philosophy:<br /><br />Do your utmost to give your children an academically advantaged home. Don't let them rot their brains in front of the screen. If they do play computer games, make them educational. Teach kids to be resilient. Encourage your children to do what they love.  Give children freedom to make their own choices and decisions.<br /><br />After my freshman year I ran into Mary many times on campus, but we were never very close. I think Mary alone knew (and perhaps felt awkward about) how much added stress her own experience had put on me. I was the one who cleaned up after her. I made sure she wasn't locked out when she lost her keys for the 50th time. I was the one who sometimes turned her SLE papers in for her. I was the one who held her hand when she was delirious and the police took her away to the hospital.<br /><br />Ibegan this post with one of my favorite college memories. Well that last story, of watching Mary drive away to the mental hospital was one of the worst. I love Stanford, but to this day I think that the University failed both Mary and me that quarter.<br /><br />Mary should have received help and been sent home earlier. Somebody from the University, anybody, should have acknowledged the unfair burden that was placed on me taking care of her. Cleaning up the mess a Tiger Mom can make is not fun, especially for a 19-year-old.  There are some prices that are too high to pay for beautiful music.

If people can see your network's name before they've connected to it, then SSID broadcasting is turned on. When broadcasting is disabled your network will never show up in a list of available networks; instead, people have to click \\"Join Other Network\\" (or similar) and manually type in your network name before they even get to the password box. It's a great bit of security since neighbors and random people driving by won't even know your network exists if they don't already know its name.<br /><br />Even if you enable SSID broadcasting temporarily for the receiver to connect, the moment you turn broadcasting back off the receiver will immediately lose its connection. It will then refuse to re-connect until broadcasting is turned back on.<br /><br />Do not buy this unless your network name is being broadcast or you are OK with turning broadcasting on.<br /><br />PS: If they ever fix this issue with a firmware update and I haven't yet returned the wireless adapter, I will update this review.

B000093FLA|5.0|Of all the film genres, action and action comedies are where films by foreign directors have reached the quality of films by US directors.  It used to be that the best action movies and action comedies had names like Lucas, Spielberg, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola attached to it.  No more.  Now the top action and action-comedies are often made by Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn, Christopher Nolan, Guillermo del Toro, Peter Jackson and other non-US directors.  This is probably most epitomized in the field of crime-action-comedy.  American films of this class has degenerated into rehashes of franchises such as Die Hard, Terminator, and Bad Boys, with over-the-top special effects, forgettable soundtracks, and bad dialogue.  England, on the other hand, is producing 1 or 2 great urban crime comedies annually.  It all started with this production from the pairing of Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn, Snatch.  Taking a look at the criminal underworld of the UK, we see splices from the world of gambling, money laundering, illegal fights, pawnshops, and the black market trade in jewels.  The movie populates this world with a collection of characters of varying dryness and sarcasm, all trying to outwit the other while staying alive.  Yes there are gunfights, but they are few and far between, and like real gunfights, and unlike those featured in US-made movies; almost everyone gets hit.  What carries the movie is the dialogue, and seeing how the different characters talk down, or up, or to each other; profanity or no profanity.  This ranges from Brad Pitt's take of a Irish vagrant to a Jason Statham's personification of an exasperated middleman caught between a rock and a hard place.  All of it is well-crafted and speaks to the script-writing underlying this movie.  Overall, well worth the watch.
B007R41E8O|1.0|not great. at all.. took three tries to download and it wad not enjoyable. the searches were fun but repetitive and the rest of play was very disjointed.. i used the hints alot because i had no idea what to do next and had been wandering around forever.. and the story ended up being really disappointing.. lose ends and what it did finish was laame. dont buy

B007SGM084|1.0|I've been thinking of purchasing this trilogy for a few months.  I then began comparing the prices of down loading the three books ($9.99 each) vs. downloading the trilogy ($29.99) as a single transaction.  The kindle version is overpriced in my opinion to begin with, but purchasing a set should be CHEAPER than purchasing the books separately.  The general idea when buying a set  is to SAVE money, NOT PAY MORE!<br />This is not the first time I've encountered this type of issue.  Amazon needs to pay attention because they will start losing customers if it continues.  I am very disappointed to see this happening in a good, fair compnay.

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|I'd seen so many bad reviews of this film that i only dared rent it when all other options were exhausted. Surprisingly, i found it compelling and involving from start to finish. I'd heard most of the complaints about the ending, and i admit that it was  disappointing to invest so much time in a character only to find the story unresolved. But I enjoyed the rest of the film as a survivalist's tale. Perhaps it's best to call this a mood piece.
B000MV8XPG|1.0|I bought this for my 3 year old's birthday.  Unfortunately he hasn't been able to play with it because it came with the incorrect parts.  Two e-mails and still no response from the manufacturer.  No phone number other than an international number.  No thanks - I think this one is going back to Amazon.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a very entertaining story which will definitely keep the reader interested from the beginning to the end. Its an easy read, with a story that is not difficult to follow. The author has created a unique world which in many ways the reader can relate to, but it's certainly different than anything I have ever read. None the less, it contains all the necessary elements (cast of characters, adventure, pathos, violence, suspense)  that a good story needs so I recommended it highly. It's an excellent summer trilogy for young and old.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought when I first started reading this book it would all be smut and sex, but there really is a story behind it.  I thought I would take a break between books one and two, but I had to start right into book 2.  You really need to read all three to know what everyone is talking about.  Enjoyed all of them especially two.

1781161097|2.0|The product description for this release indicates that it will be the only publication to accompany \\"Prometheus,\\" and that's a shame.  Ridley Scott's film is a gorgeous and highly detailed work, of which this book only scratches the surface.  While the quality of the book and reproduction of photos is great (though I found myself wishing that they'd opted for a larger format than what was ultimately used), there's a very \\"general\\" sense to the proceedings.  Nothing is terribly in-depth, and instead of being interested and focused on the background text I found myself skimming through the pages after only a short while.<br /><br />A disappointment.  \\"Prometheus\\" deserves better.
B0086DBE62|1.0|I am pretty easily entertained and have watched countless movies through amazon instant videos. But I gotta say this is definitely the worst movie I have ever paid for using this service. There are obviously bright spot, Hammer does a solid job as the silly prince. But with the 2 different \\"Snow White\\" movies coming out this year, I expected this one to at least be funny. Obviously they try to put it in the comedic vein or genera, but with the job they did, it simply does not fit. If you have any of the \\"higher up\\" channels then wait for this movie to come out on them, if not then wait for a friend to foolishly purchase the blu-ray. If it were free I would say it was adequate. Just don't use your own money on this film...
1937986039|5.0|I will not repeat content of other reviewers of this excellent guide to the Fujifilm X-10 camera, a compact that is sadly let down somewhat by a sometimes unclear user manual. Alexander S.White has done users a favour with this highly informative but equally importantly, easy-to-use illustrated guide. It is well worth its price as it helps one navigate the camera's many features to maximise efficient us of the feature-packed X-10. Well done!
B006H8BIIM|1.0|So this was the featured free app of the day and I'm a sci fi nut so I thought why not? All in all an AMAZING game. Loved everything about it until about level 4. I always ignore the option to pay, preferring to grind out what I need in resources. This game makes it impossible to progress without either paying or grinding away for over a day. Sorry but if I want to be extorted I'll look at my insurance bill.
0985081821|4.0|Writing a review of this novel is almost impossible without making some comparison to the Twilight Series, so I'm going to get this out of the way up front. First of all, I'm not a hater of Twilight; I didn't love what I've read of the series so far, but I thought that they were decent books and I applaud Stephenie Meyer for all that she has accomplished. Sophia's Journey does have some similarities in tone, feel, and plot to Twilight. However, there are significant differences between the two that make the start of this series so much better. To start with, Rebecca Hamilton's writing style is much more engaging and her imagery is much more vivid. Also, the character's are a bit older and I didn't feel myself being inundated with all of the teenage angst that Meyer's books ladled on so thickly. Yes, the developing love story is there and there some indecision about whether or not those involved should be involved with one another, but this is handled so much better and is not nearly as annoying as in Twilight. The biggest and most impressive difference between the two is the mythology that Hamilton has created into her story compared to that in Twilight.<br /><br />Indeed we have vampires (of a sort here), but these vampires don't stay out of the sun because it makes them shiny, they have more traditional reasons. What makes this novel \\"shine\\", is Hamilton's creation of a mythos of elementals. Each type of elementals has their own abilities, powers, life-span, etc. that makes each unique. I felt that her myth building was much more believable, so to speak, that that presented in the Twilight series and that, in turn, got me more involved in the storyline.<br /><br />The characters are also well written and developed and there are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the pace moving and interesting. The love story could be a bit much for me at times and I admit to rolling my eyes a bit at the descriptions of exactly what people were wearing, but I'm not exactly in the target audience for this particular type of novel and I expected to encounter at least a little of these types of things and they did not detract from my enjoyment of the novel. I truly found this to be an entertaining novel and will be continuing along with the series as it progresses.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is a fun and a very awesome. I'm glad I can get it on my kindle.:) :)
B008B1W3V4|5.0|A new direction for Maroon 5, sure...but it's a good one and they haven't sounded better. This a great album for the summer. Lots of fun, but also very musical.
0446572993|5.0|The first 248 pages of the hardback book were the best I've read in a long time! Tense, terse, fast, action-packed. This is the best there is in thriller fiction. Unfortunately the book has 422 pages. A great intertwining of three plots: the assassin's problems, the little girl's problems, and the mystery behind why all the deaths are occurring. It slows down and becomes repetitive starting with page 249. Actually, the author gives away the bad guy early on with a small piece of trivia that was completely out of place with the rest of the tight narrative. Then he repeats the trivia again in a couple of hundred pages so you know right then that is the giveaway for sure. The book wraps up with a tired, old cliched ending. Too bad. But given all that, I read this book in six hours and I'm giving it five stars.<br /><br />My one gripe to the copy editor is learn the fact that none is a singular noun. It does not take a plural verb, even if the object of the modifying prepositional phrase is plural. E.g., None of the colorful airplanes is at the airport. None is an Old English contraction of not one. Replace none with not one in the sentence and you can see the singularity. End of sermon. Sorry, just popped out.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray version of this box set.<br /><br />I love the \\"Alien\\" films, even the ugly stepchild \\"Alien 3,\\" which many viewers didn't seem to have the patience for -- this was David Fincher's first film, and I do blame the studio for making this mess -- Fincher's work ever since this movie suggests he was interfered with rather drastically.<br /><br />Each film has its own distinct \\"feel.\\" \\"Alien\\" is the horror movie, \\"Aliens\\" is the action movie, \\"Alien 3\\" is the existential movie, and \\"Alien Resurrection\\" feels a lot like old-timey, retro science fiction to me (and did when it came out).<br /><br />In short, these films deserve excellent presentation, and for the most part, the Blu-ray version delivers. You get the two-fer treatment for each film -- two versions of each of the movies, mostly labeled theatrical release and director's cut, although in the case of Alien 3 the longer version can't be called that because Fincher has disowned the film. As for Ridley Scott, he has said on more than one occasion that the theatrical cut is his preferred version of \\"Alien,\\" though this set does include what we'll just call an \\"alternate\\" version.<br /><br />My main problem with the Blu-ray edition -- and the reason I cannot give it four stars -- is that the discs take an inordinately long time to load. I thought maybe it was my player, but it happens on both my Sony and Yamaha -- and the Yamaha is pretty sophisticated, although not top of the line.<br /><br />Still, this is a worthy collection, obviously -- and the chance to see these movies in HD, with high-def sound to boot, is irresistible.
0345803493|5.0|So, after reading the first book, I was completley shocked by the ending,which intrigued me more to read he second book. At the beginning we picked up right where we left off,  Ana walking out and Christian, bless his heart, just as sad as can be. 50 Shades Darker was the perfect title for this book. I loved seeing more of Christians emotions and his sincere ability to grow in this developing relationship with Ana. I think this book revealed more of Christians character and past which helped give a interesting background to this man and how he functions. 50 Shades Darker explained everything that happened in the first and then more. That was and still is the main reason I like the book, because of the character growth development from 50 Shades of Grey to 50 Shades Darker.
B003UESJJC|5.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray \\"Full Disclosure\\" edition of \\"Apocalypse Now\\"/\\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\"/\\"Hearts of Darkness.\\"<br /><br />Finally, this film gets the treatment it deserves. Whether you prefer the original theatrical version (without the French plantation sequence) or \\"Apocalypse Now Redux,\\" which included that sequence plus additional scenes, you'll really enjoy seeing them in high-definition with HD sound. The film transfers are just stunning -- no version of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" has ever looked like this.<br /><br />And, at long last, we get the inclusion of the documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness,\\" which chronicles the making of the film and the extreme toll the long shoot took on director Francis Ford Coppola, his family, his star Martin Sheen, and others. At times, this look behind the scenes feels almost as harrowing as \\"Apocalypse Now\\" itself.<br /><br />I have bought many versions of this -- too many, probably. But I could not resist the opportunity to own this. It's worth every penny I paid for it.
0345803485|5.0|50 shades of Grey was the best book I have read in awhile. As an avid reader I like books that peak my interest and this book exceeded my expectations. The hype about 50 Shades was really good and lived up to it. I loved how the characters relationship develops and how much growth is seen in one of the main characters. I can't wait to read the next two books! And a tip for those who want to buy the book, I say read the first two chapters to see if you like it, because I think 50 shades is a book that you either like it or you don't.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I cannot help but agree with the many critics and viewers who have declared that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the best-ever superhero movie. In fact, in my opinion, nothing else even comes CLOSE.<br /><br />This is, quite simply, excellent moviemaking, with great characters, unforgettable visuals, and (thank GOD!) a story that actually works. That last element is the one most superhero -- indeed, many genre -- movies lack. Too often, the script is just poor -- lazily written, no character development, nonsensical. Here, though, we get a terrific, if not terribly original, story: The Joker appears, intent on wreaking havoc on Gotham City, apparently just because he can. He doesn't really need a reason, which works because it reflects the senselessness of our Age of Terror. Meanwhile, a good man named Harvey Dent is going bad, transforming into the hideously burned Two-Face.<br /><br />And, worst of all, Batman -- never trusted that much anyway -- may just have to take the fall for everything that goes wrong.<br /><br />Christian Bale's Batman is more nuanced and yet more powerful in this sequel. Aaron Eckhart brings true pathos to his depiction of Harvey Dent/Two-Face; you genuinely feel for him because of the torment he suffers, and yet at the same time, he horrifies.<br /><br />Best of all, though, was Heath Ledger as the Joker. It truly was a performance for the ages -- and would have been recognized as such even if the actor had not died not long after completing the role. Ledger is just fantastic in conveying the Joker's arrogance, pain, viciousness and, yes, wicked amusement at all he does.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan, whose work I've always liked (see \\"Memento\\" if you haven't!) is superb here -- and I say that as someone who is NOT a fan of shifting aspect ratios. I don't really know how he did it, but he makes it work here. In the theater, the aspect ratio shifted from 2.40:1 to 1.43:1 for the IMAX scenes. Nolan can't do that on the home-theater version, but does make use of the contrast between 2:40 and 1.78:1 on the blu-ray version. I should absolutely hate this -- it's not a technique that's used much, but when it has been, I have found it jarring and unpleasant. Here, it didn't bother me in the slightest -- I just watched the movie and was carried away by it.<br /><br />I also agree with those who say the movie is too long -- and yet, having seen it once in the theater and several times at home now, I'm usually at a loss to say what I think should have been cut out.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is an extraordinary experience. I don't know how Nolan is going to top this, but I eagerly await the third and final installment.t does make use of the contrast between 2:40 and 1.78:1 on the blu-ray version.

B0000509C4|3.0|I like this movie. On it's own it's a pretty decent flick but since it's compared to the first which is a masterpiece in horror movie making it gets a bad rap. Now one thing most everyone can agree on out of the 3 stories (what happend to 5 stories???) the raft is the stand out here. It's worth the price of admission alone and worth a 4 star if it wasn't for the other 2. And that's not to say the first and third story are bad. They're really good stories honestly, just not executed well. I mean the actors they had in them were good but they have a sort of a take one, good, now print feeling. Basically just a little sloppy and rushed to make a quick buck off the popularity of the first movie.<br /><br />This is a really great popcorn flick. Why it gets a hard time I don't know, it's a fun movie to watch now as it was back when I was a kid seeing this for the first time. Just remember this isn't Titanic. Gather around the tube, have a few brews with friends and throw your own MST3K comments at this flick and have fun. This is what this movie is all about. But then again isn't all horror just a dark comedy? This movie just makes it a little more obvious!
B003EYVXVY|3.0|I saw \\"Avatar\\" in IMAX 3D the day it was released. I must say that, for three hours, I was absolutely entertained and thoroughly engaged with the movie. I saw it with a good friend, and afterward, we both found many things about the movie that we admired.<br /><br />We also found, as several days and then weeks went by, that the movie simply faded away. In other words, it just did not provoke any more discussion, or indeed make any sort of real, lasting impression on us. I give \\"Avatar\\" three stars for its storytelling drive and its special effects, but can't go any higher than that because, ultimately, the movie is emotionally shallow and extremely pedantic.<br /><br />It isn't as if James Cameron isn't capable of making movies with heart. \\"The Abyss\\" depended on a lot of special effects, too, but the scene involving the Deepcore crew trying to resuscitate Mary Elizabeth Mastranto is one of the most emotionally charged I've ever seen. By contrast, \\"Avatar\\" did not make me care all that much about its characters. NONE of them.<br /><br />Worse, the movie is about as subtle as a punch in the snoot. James Cameron's disdain for what President Eisenhower dubbed \\"the military-industrial complex\\" is highly evident in several of his films, including \\"The Abyss\\" and \\"Aliens.\\" Here, though, he takes it to absurd proportions. Giovanni Ribisi's Parker Selfridge and Stephen Lang's Col. Miles Quarich are both such caricatures that they might as well be cartoons. The former is your ultimate company man, and while Ribisi is a talented actor, he just can't do much with this, as the script has his character practically oozing contempt for anything that smacks of environmentalism or spiritual importance. The natives of Pandora stand in the way of wealth, and he'll do anything to erase them from the scene. As for Lang -- I don't think I've ever seen an actor so cheated out of something that could have been meaningful. He's very good, but Quarich is so absurdly gung-ho that his efforts in portraying him with any sort of complexity are completely wasted.<br /><br />Sam Worthington is likable enough as the protagonist, Jake Sully, but that's all he ends up being -- likable. Not truly heroic, which he should be.<br /><br />Performance-wise, that leaves Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, the former being a young actress (she played Uhura in the \\"Star Trek\\" reboot) and the latter being a veteran who has worked with Cameron before (\\"Aliens\\"). Saldana's Neytiri is probably the most compelling character in the film; Saldana works hard to make her so. Her respect for life and her world come off as completely authentic. Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine is the most COMFORTABLE character in the film -- a woman at home not only in her own skin but also in the body of her avatar. Weaver achieves this with a performance that's understated, not over the top.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, their efforts are overwhelmed by the sheer and sometimes dead weight of the film.<br /><br />I've read that Cameron is planning not one but at least two -- and possibly three -- sequels. I find myself very ambivalent about the prospect. Right now, my stance is that I suppose I'd see them if it were convenient, on an otherwise slow weekend. Or I could just as easily skip them.<br /><br />When he's at his best, Cameron is a terrific filmmaker. \\"Terminator 2\\" was heart-stopping, edge-of-the-seat action -- but somehow Cameron made it an affecting story as well, to the point that I could get a lump in my throat over the demise of a machine. With \\"Avatar,\\" though, he let the special effects -- including the 3-D -- and the ponderous, preachy themes get in his own way.in portraying him with any sort of complexity are completely wasted.<br /><br />Sam Worthington is likable enough as the protagonist, Jake Sully, but that's all he ends up being -- likable.

I actually would like to have seen more of his antics with the villagers and staff, rather than the princess' story.<br /><br />The dwarfs were interesting, funny at times.  Their hovel, the forest, and the Robin Hood hook are what I wanted to be fleshed out.<br />** I kept asking myself where did the fresh strawberries and ?tomatoes? come from, given the perpetual winter.<br />  Yes, I know there's a time limit.<br /><br />Sean Bean, seriously, winter and the beast is a dragon - did he or his agent write this? At least he didn't die from Orc arrows in this fantasy tale.  I the only one that has the impression he was shanghi'd into this. I also suspect the \\"Captain\\" was line coach for his brief appearance.<br /><br />Sorry, Lily Collins' neanderthal eyebrows are one impression that I am going to have a problem forgetting.<br /><br />The ending was good, the hook of \\"know when you are beaten...\\" was nice.  Plus, Lily's best part was her Bolly Wood song and dance number at the end for the movie.<br /><br />Again, an ok movie. I got the impression that someone was told to hit the standard story points and get it out the door.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|i read all three of the books last year, so when i heard that this one was going to become a film, i instantly got excited to see it. the previews weren't very revealing, which i liked about it. if it was going to be anything like the book, i just knew it would be good. they left quite a few things out in the movie that were very significant things, that should have been included in the film. the part with the muttations was messed up. they were exactly described in that appearance and the eyes were supposed to match with the previous tributes, which was not mentioned at all. that was a very significant highlight in the novel. katniss mentioned that quite a few times to herself, but the movie showed nothing along those lines.<br />another thing i didn't particularly like about the movie was that it was definitely apparent that the people filming the movie did not use a tripod at all, which made it annoying and hard to focus in. when the camera shakes all over the place, it does not keep a person entertained. luckily i could still tell what was happening, even when they zoomed in too close on peoples' faces and the camera shook everywhere. they also filmed way too fast between killing scenes. it is obvious by the novel's plot that the movie should have been rated R. so they should have focus on each death, seeing as that was the prominent part about the story line. collins also went into detail on each death, so that was not shown in each scene in the movie.<br />i did not think this was supposed to be a movie for kids, but all of a sudden they were getting hyped up about, that made me wish it would have been more gruesome. i am more than surprised that parents would have let their kids go see this movie anyway. i think this was a movie where people who had already read the books would have been left wanting more, expecting more, while those who just decided to see the movie on a whim, not having read the books were simply happy with the outcome of the movie.<br />iam not sure why they left out key characters either. Madge was supposed to be katniss's best friend in the book, so i don't understand why she was completely left out. they never also went into too much detail about the stylists for katniss. one of their names was mentioned in the movie, Octavia i think, but her other stylist was completely left out description wise.<br />either way, i am still pumped for the next two movies. i can't wait to see what they do with them. Finnick especially will be an interesting one. he was one of my favorite characters, so it was upsetting to find him killed off in Mockingjay, as well as Cinna. i still hope the movies follow the books well. i could see certain actors/actresses for certain characters, but i know they probably go way off course with them, appearance wise. we'll see. i may buy this movie when it comes out. its hard to say. i just wasn't too excited with the two main actor choices. they just didn't fit the character descriptions at all.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This movie reminded me of 'Armageddon' in that it was full of idiotic plot-holes.<br /><br />If you don't mind idiocy or a complete lack of any semblance of internal consistency in your stories then I suppose you might not loathe this pathetic excuse for a movie.<br /><br />I almost walked out several times and after it was over I wished that I had heeded my instincts; it never got better, only stupider. It vacillated between being utterly dull and spectacularly inane.<br /><br />Some of the visuals were okay. I liked that it was consistent with 'Alien' in a couple of ways (though it was completely *in*consistent in several other ways).<br /><br />I wish I could have my two hours and $15 back. I don't know how Hollywood creates movies this crappy, nor how a script writer could come up with something this moronic. With a decent script it could've been an okay movie.
0345803485|1.0|This book has to be one of the worst things ever written. Seriously, I could write better than this crap when I was ten. The dialogue is stilted and unrealistic, the characters are not only flat but contradictory and inconsistent. And how on earth is Ana a college student in 2011 who doesn't have a computer or even an e-mail address? Colleges give every student an e-mail address for heaven's sake! And the plot? Well, there was really none to speak of. Girl meets boy. Girl thinks boy is completely arrogant and yet \\"so freakin' hot\\" that she immediately wants to have sex with him, despite the two devoted guy friends she has who are described as \\"hot\\" and \\"cute\\" respectively and, apart from that, genuinely nice guys who want to - what a shock - actually date her instead of ordering her around and using her as a submissive sex slave. And yet she rebuffs their attentions completely, instead choosing to go after the multi-billionaire Adonis with a helicopter and what she dubs the Red Room of Pain so that he can undertake her \\"basic training\\" in the area of sex. And that's what I've gleaned from reading only the first half of the book... at which point I reached my limit of \\"oh, craps\\" and deleted the horrible thing off my kindle.    The writing is juvenile, repetitive, and filled with grammatical errors and partial sentences. Ana blushed or flushed at least once a page, almost invariably followed or preceded by an \\"oh crap,\\" \\"double crap\\", \\"holy crap\\", or even the ridiculous \\"triple crap.\\" Her \\"subconscious\\"/\\"inner goddess\\" alternatively urged her to think about what she was doing and to throw everything to the wind. At least 10 times in what I read, Ana loses her appetite and Christian tells her she \\"has to eat\\" because he has a \\"thing about wasted food.\\" See DS from LA's review for a longer list of all the repetitive phrases. Several times while reading this I had to put down my kindle for a second in disbelief at how horrible the writing is.    I can't believe this book became a best-seller, much less surpassed Harry Potter in sales. I know that this was originally written as Twilight fan fiction, and a lot of reviews have been calling it the \\"XXX\\" version of Twilight. I happen to be a fan of Twilight - not a fanatic, but a fan - and I can say this book was nowhere near as good. Twilight is not by any means great literature, and it definitely has its flaws, but at least Meyers' writing is less repetitive, mostly grammatical, and, more importantly, her books have a plot, her characters have some semblance of depth and verisimilitude, and I could relate to them and their emotions. I could not relate to the characters in 50 Shades at all, partially because they were so unrealistic, and partially because every choice Ana made made me want to shake some sense into her and every word Christian said made me either roll my eyes in disbelief or want him to materialize in front of me so I could slap him. I also didn't see any depth or genuine emotion to her relationship with Christian, which seems to be based on nothing more than the fact that she thinks he's hot. You can bleat and say \\"who cares if it's unrealistic, it's fantasy\\" all you want, but that doesn't make up for the one-dimensional, unengaging characters, the disgraceful writing, and the lack of any real plot or conflict. That doesn't make for a good fantasy at all in my book.    P.S. You know it's bad when the reviews are better written than the book!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|These books are quick reads.  Interesting concept, even.  But if only the writing was worthy of all the controversy.  I await books two & three
B007K3JCAE|5.0|With a different take of the classical Sherlock Holmes series, this one was action packed. It was completely enjoyable and entertaining.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I liked the game a lot. It kept my interest throughout the game. I would recommend the game to friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot. There are many games in just one app!!! Definitely worth the zero dollars I paid for it.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|Overall, I am a huge fan and I was not disappointed by this album. But I also found the clicking noise on So Long distracting enough that although the song is lovely I tend to skip over it. I understand now that it is Ms. Gardot's nails clicking rhythmically, but it still distracts from the song. Worse though is a problem with the production of the last track [11] Iemanja. I have now received two copies of the CD from Amazon, so I am confident this is a productiion error. I actually tried calling Verve Music the first time and was treated pretty rudely [West Coast office in Santa Monica] when I explained to them that the last track plays the song and then dead silence for almost fifteen minutes followed by some background noise that sounds like some sound engineers fooling around. Maybe they should have paid more attention when they laid down the tracks. Amazon graciously offered me a refund again, and I am going to download the last track instead. But if you buy CD's like me and then copy into ITunes, this is really annoying. I generally just throw a bunch of CD's in my car because it's older and I don't have a built in IPod doc, so I have to skip over this last song now to start the CD again unless I want to tolerate the silence.<br /><br />Despite all of this I adore Ms. Gardot as an artist. My One and Only was a gift from my sister, and I play it all the time, and will do the same with [most of the tracks] on this album. I also do ballroom dancing as a hobby, and plan on bringing Impossible Love to the studio to play for the owner Irena Trebunskya, Mom to Anna and mother in law to Jonathan of Dancing With The Stars. Would love to see them Tango to this track!<br /><br />Now if Verve would show more care about their product and their customers.<br /><br />And when will Melody finally do a show in Los Angeles?
B005PK1G76|5.0|Reasonable price, not too ugly logo splashed over the side, two compartments for cups plus a small pocket with a zipper inside. The only thing i wish it has was some kind of cover that you could pull over the top and maybe fasten with a velcro strip on the site. It would be for situations like sudden rain or when you are packing your stroller up let's say in the airport and you have to remove the organizer bag. In the airport i usually put the organizer bag into the stroller storage bag alongside with the stroller itself but it gets rather bumped in there and it's contents all over the place. Otherwise, ten points!
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Very humbling.... Starting from step one across the board will definetly prove to you how little modern workouts actually build strength.<br />I challenge everyone ages 5 - 80 to master this book.<br />Just weeks in I was being complimented by my work buddies.
0393064476|4.0|The book does a great at giving the audience a glimpse of the daily life of the dark ages.<br />However, the book most me read with caution, since the author appears bias and likes the ability to be neutral when talking about the topic.<br />The reader needs to read various book about this era in order to have an understanding of the topic, and not base all knowledge in this one particular book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the story, identified with the characters.  I especially loved that there were several main characters who were \\"heroes\\" in their own way.  My children read it and they loved the trilogy too. They identified issues not picked up in the movie, such as what is considred ample vs. enough, in terms of food. The book keeps noting the food supply for the Districts and how they are kept with just enough to survive. The Capital is over-indulged.  There are these opposites and differences that are compared and contrasted throughout the story.  WE all felt ourselves asking \\"what is really important?\\" and \\"how much is enough?\\".  My son asked, why is the future worse than today, which is a an insightful question.  The oppression was even based on the perspective of the district, and there were those that embraced it and others that dreaded it.  So again, that concept was a contrasting theme throughout the books, as well.  The book is so much more than children fighting to the death.  It is about oppression and uprising and everything in between.  It is about survival, and sometimes survival at all costs- and - there high cost of survival has nothing to do with monetary issues.  Characters were used as pawns, played a role in larger agendas- without realizing their impact.  I found myself remembering what is really important, and how much would I be willing to do for freedom? I did a lot of soul searching with this book, and completely enjoyed it.  My kids were hiding the book under the covers and reading at night with flashlights.  I had to take the books away from them so they would go to sleep- they couldn't put it down either.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Every one said its a must read. It was only a soft porn book . I found it to be a slow read. I kept waiting for it to get more interesting . My husband n I have a great sex life n we don't have to hurt or punish each other to have great sex. I am scared of young woman reading this book and getting wrong ideas of a healthy sex life.
B0086700CM|4.0|my kids got hold of it and played it much better than I who was just learning it. needless to say they robbed me of earning the achievements for myself and have it playing at a level beyond my skills. since I cant reset it I cant go back and build my skills at my preferred pace. my kids did say it is much nicer playing it on my kindle fire rather than their ipods. the like a bigger screen.
0345803485|3.0|You know going in, that picking up this book isnt going to be a pulitzer winning read. Come on.  But yet you are holding it and reading it anyway!  The reason that I gave this three stars is because I think there is SO much more potential for an amazing storyline here that is NOT filled with S & M sex on every other page!  These characters have distinct qualities and I believe that they are much more than flat.  They have dimensions AND THAT IS WHAT IS KEEPING ME READING.  I muddled through this first book, and honestly I kinda actually fast forwarded through all the sex which really didnt do much for me.  I get much more turned on by a good plot...which believe it or not, IS STUCK IN THERE SOMEWHERE.  I will tell you that I am enthralled with Christian's character because early on I devised that there is a reason that he is the way he is.  Ana is just your typical, naive virgin in love with her first boyfriend who just happens to be 50 shades of ---- you know what!  Can we all remember how enamored we were of our first boyfriends?? Now imagine that he was like Christian! OMG I couldnt even!  I think this author captured her beautifully.  She is in love, confused, curious and appalled - that is a lot of feelings to have all at once...and we would all be like that if we were in her shoes! Think about it.  Also, the role of Mrs. Robinson is really under my skin. I want to know who she is, WHY she is, what she's like and WHY she and Christian are still such good, close friends.  That will not start happening until the second book though, which I just started and am only a few chapters in.  I'll be reviewing them all as I finish them.<br /><br />So that's about it.  The writing may be redundant, or even childish although I dont think so.  But if you dont want an easy summer read that full of sleazy sex and a halfway decent plot that is really fun then dont pick up this book.  As for me, I'm enjoying them and I think you will too if your expectations arent too high.
0345803485|5.0|This is the best romance I've read in a long time. I love her inner goddess! So glad there are 2 more after this and I bought all three.
0743298039|3.0|I read this since it was recommended after The Forgotten Garden, a book I could not put down.  The Thirteenth Tale is well written, and its easy to read.  But the story is just weird.  You never do find out the motivation for the recurring violence in the book even though it shapes a lot of the action.  It comes off as creepy and a device to keep things hidden within the story itself.  I can't imagine that I'd ever read it again despite the praise of other reviewers along those lines.  I would not recommend it.<br /><br />The ending is bizarre and convoluted to be sure.
0470913029|2.0|I believe a healthy diet is critical for a long healthy and happy life.  However, I do not believe comparison to the caveman diet who had a life expectancy of &lt;30 years is very credible.  Cholestrol is not taken into consideration in this diet but should be.  I think I'll write a diet/lifestyle book.  \\"If it comes in a box or package, has food coloring, chemicals or additives or you can drive through driveway to buy your meal, don't eat it's because it's toxic.  In addition to that, limit or eliminate eating anything that has a face. Also remember, starch or carbohydrate is just a different name for sugar.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is the most amazing book, what insight Dr. Chapman has to the depth of the soul.  I have read this book and my husband is almost finished.  And I can say with 110% certainly that this book has changed our lives forever.  I have always felt guilty because I wanted to receive gifts (read book for definition) from my husband and craved more physical contact from him than he already gave (again see book for definition).  Little did I know that physical contact was my love language with my dialect split between gifts and words of affirmation.  I feel as though for the first time in my LIFE that my feeling are validated and NOT SELFISH. My husband now understands that when he doesn't speak my \\"language\\" and my love tank is empty, how it affects me and us.  I recommend that EVERY ONE (well adults) read this book, single or attached it will open your eyes not only to your language but to languages of others. I wish we would have read this book years ago, how much happier and easier my life and relationships would have been!!!  A must read, I give it 10 stars!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game they are very creative. But the problem is that they should be considerate of the updates.
B00005JPAO|5.0|interesting and very good movie, my wife and I enjoyed, not much else to say, I believe most people will enjoy and find that it informative and worth the time taken to watch.
0345803507|5.0|This is the best romance I've read in a long time. It is just plain gripping and oh so steamy! A must read! I miss my Fifty!
0307951529|5.0|Every high school student should read this book. Approaching all work this way, whether you<br />are self-employed or not would make such a difference. As someone else said, more than a book-<br />it's a community. The kind of community that will make the world a better place for all.<br />Truly!
B0086700CM|4.0|My kids have been playing this on their iPods all year.  They couldn't wait for it to come out for Kindle so they could play on a bigger screen.  They really enjoy it.  I cannot say anything from personal experience, as my hand/eye coordination just does not exist.
0671646788|4.0|I reread the first two-three chapters monthly to as a friendly reminder.  The rest of the book is good and worth reading once or twice....but I constantly find myself consulting the first few chapters as they are the most powerful.  Necessary reading for living in a very fearful world and pressure to conform to the status quo.
0345803493|5.0|When I got the first book I waited to start it when I could really enjoy it. Once I started reading it I could not put it down. I was swept in to the wild, racy world of Christian and Annstasia. And it did not take me long to finish and order the next one. What a book, it is a great read and the feeling you get from the lush, vivid story is so engrossing that you really want more.<br />The Fifty Shades Trilogy is the best summer read since Interview with a Vampire.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is very nice. I admire all of the graphics and the surprising quality of gameplay. All in all, quite a fascinating and fun game.
0345803493|5.0|It just keeps getting better. The only bad thing about this book is I know there's only 1 more after this one.
1451648537|4.0|Walter Isaacson's \\"Steve Jobs\\" is  self-explanatory -- it's a biography about the late Steve Jobs, founder of Apple Inc. and considered a visionary because of products ranging from the Macintosh to the iPhone. I became a fan of Isaacson's writing after reading his biography about Benjamin Franklin -- in that book, the author acknowledged Franklin's greatness while not sugar-coating his warts. To his credit, Isaacson provided the same treatment in his biography of Jobs. He acknowledged Jobs' creativity and brilliance while not ignoring the fact that Jobs had warts. A lot of them.<br /><br />I appreciated the honest assessment and applaud Isaacson for it. He acknowledged knowing Jobs for years before writing this book, and even liking him. This is a tough situation for a biographer, and one might expect that, after reading Isaacson's acknowledgement at the beginning of the book, that the book itself would be nothing but a saccharine work about Jobs' greatness and creative vision. Fortunately, the opposite was true. The biography was an honest assessment (that Jobs never read, which I found interesting).<br /><br />Still, a couple of things interfered with my giving this a 5-star ranking. First, the constant harping about Jobs' believing he was \\"damaged\\" because he was adopted. This is nonsense. Jobs grew up in a loving (and very tolerant) home. JOBS may have felt as though he was damaged goods because his birth parents didn't raise him, but I thought Isaacson hammered the point home a little too much. We know Jobs was adopted and for whatever reason was \\"wounded\\" by the experience. The constant mention of it seemed to be almost a justification of Jobs' behavior.<br /><br />Second, there was the constant emphasis on the fact that Jobs believed he was \\"special.\\" Again, okay. Jobs was egocentric (and dare I say narcissistic?). But it felt as though Isaacson was using Jobs' \\"specialness\\" to justify the fact that he could get away with behaving like a total jerk. In fact,there were times throughout the book during which I felt Jobs was acting like such a jerk, I wondered how he managed to have friends, let alone a loving wife.<br /><br />These are complaints about Jobs, certainly. But I felt Isaacson could have laid off on the repetition of these and other points that came up frequently.<br /><br />But in all, Isaacson had a tough assignment -- to compile a biography of a living individual (okay, some might say a \\"living legend\\") who was known for being hypercritical and obsessive. The fact that Issacson was able to churn out this straightforward book with a phantom Jobs looking over his shoulder is, in my opinion, nothing short of remarkable.
B003DBOS7Y|4.0|Originally started watching this without hubby.  He kept coming in and out of the room until finally he just sat down and watched.  He admitted this one seemed different than your typical chick flick. Picture quality over Amazon app for Roku very good.  Did not read the book, so I can't say how it compares.
0071762345|4.0|This is a good introduction book to social media and different platforms for business owners that are new to this.  Easy read, good case studies and examples, and great introductions to numerous social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc.  If you are a knowledgeable person of social media, don't expect anything too new from this book.  You will definitely take away a few good ideas from this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|wonderful thinking game.  I work at night and during the slow time I have an opportunity to train my brain.
B0086700CM|3.0|Ok yeah it's really fun and addictive I like the game. BUT I can't reach a score that I know I can because it lags a LOT. I think that's my only complaint is to just work on the lagging and if it is fixed it will definitely be a 5 star game in my book :)
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|great game..only freezes a couple of times..needs the bugs worked out<br /> otherwise its great to play and waste time with.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I loved this game at first,but it only lets you create 30 things. Also, the game starts on adult mode which goes unnoticed until you mix two humans.
030758836X|5.0|I picked up this book because I read about it in magazine after magazine - from Time to Entertainment Weekly and more. It is exceptional, the kind of book you can't put down. The book begins as you join Nick in his dilemma, where did his wife go? Before too long you're pretty certain you know whodunnit, but boy will you be wrong. Even your second guess will be wrong. I don't want to give anything away. This writer really puts more twists in this book than Chubby Checker ever had. Read it, you won't be disappointed!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|is it AMAZING? THRILLING? EXCITING?yes yes and yes it is a fun filled game that seams to have no end.
0307463745|4.0|This book represents the philosophical underpinnings of Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, both influential and outspoken leaders of the tech community, and partners at 37signals, a Chicago-based web applications firm.<br />David is also the creator of Ruby on Rails, a web application framework which hosts marque sites like Twitter, Groupon, Scribd, etc.<br />The authors enjoy a cult-like status among their supporters, and David in particular is known for his brashness and readiness to stir up things. They have a distinct voice, and although not everyone agrees with them, few can accuse them of not being very clear about where they stand.<br />'Rework' continues refining the theme of 'Getting Real', an earlier self-published unsigned book by the duo. There's considerable overlap between the two books, but Rework contains some additional material, besides attributing authorship to Jason and David.<br />Incidentally, Getting Real is available as a free download at the 37signals.com website, and it's a really popular work too.<br />David and Jason are philosophically against accepting VC money and growing for the sake of growth. Bootstrapping and remaining profitable so as to be free to choose one's destiny is their mantra. Their products are kept simple, resist feature bloat, and most of their offerings are created to solve their own itches, although the fact that they are bought by thousands of people from around the world can't hurt.<br />Rework's tone is very loud, and can be grating for those who have not bought into the worldview of Jason and David. But they do have some interesting views. Consider the following passage entitled 'Start at the Epicenter':<br />\\"When you start anything new, there are forces pulling you in a variety of directions. There's the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. Start at the epicenter. For example, if you're opening a hot dog stand, youcould worry about the condiments, the cart, the name, the decoration. But the first thing you should worry about is the hot dog. The hot dogs are the epicenter. Everything else is secondary.\\"<br />Or consider this: \\"You don't make a great museum by putting all the art in the world into a single room. That's a warehouse. What makes a museum great is stuff that's not on the walls....Be a curator, stick to what's truly essential.\\"<br />Rework, and the views of its very opinionated authors, may not work for everyone. Without venture money, you can't build a scaleable company like Google, or Apple for that matter. For a very long time, until they started experimenting with keyword-triggered ads, neither the founders of Google, nor its VC investors, had any idea how the firm would pay for itself. But to be fair to Jason and David, they sincerely believe that their way of looking at things doesn't work for everyone. As they themselves say: \\"Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to real. It's why we like real flowers that wilt, not perfect plastic ones that never change. Don't worry about how you're supposed to sound and how you're supposed to act. Show the world what you're really like, warts and all.\\"<br />Rework does it with complete honesty.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I enjoy this type of game and like that I can try them out before buying.<br /> I would try the game for yourself.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I was pleased with the visual layout, the combination of a calendar and task app, and the ease of switching views (daily, weekly, monthly).  With the smaller screen, thoughtful use of color and icons becomes essential and this application performs it well. I was frustrated by the difficulty of deleting and postponing meetings and appointments.  I had to hit delete over and over with no result.  I eventually discovered that if I deleted or rescheduled in the default Android calendar, the change was reflected in the Pocket Informant.  Nevertheless, since I haven't found anything better, I'm sticking with it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire.  I suspect the device cripples the usability of the application.<br /><br />First, the Kindle Fire isn't the most sensitive touch device.  I find iOS devices to be a little more accurate about finger placement but I don't know if this is an Android issue or a Kindle Fire issue.  It's just that drawing on the device is a little difficult due to the fact it's hard to touch exactly where you want when drawing a new line.  The smaller size of the screen as opposed to many tablets doesn't make this any easier.  I find myself struggling to draw not because the app is terrible (well, maybe there's some of that too) but because the device isn't set up well for this game.<br /><br />So, I don't play much.  I'm a little disappointed at the way color selection is limited unless you pay for more colors, but I understand that and it's not a huge obstacle, it just encourages you to draw creatively.  Overall, it's a good idea and can be fun, but it really needs a good drawing device to work well.  I think it would also be better if you used a device with a stylus.<br /><br />In the end, it's three stars.  It's good, but not good enough to overcome the hardware limitations.  A little more polish on the UI or a little easier drawing experience and I'd rate it higher.

B0086700CM|3.0|when I swipe one way it does the opposite.I could go farther if I didn't die. it doesn't respond to my swipe direction.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's good. I think that there should be more interesting games, and a little easier games. But that's just what I think.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|There are many names for this kind of puzzle: Nonograms, Hanjie, Paint by Numbers, Griddlers, Picross.  It's very similar to Sudoku in that you're really using logic and pattern mapping to accomplish a goal.  In this case, it's drawing a picture, which actually turns out to feel very rewarding.<br /><br />I've been playing these games a long time, first on paper, then on many different computing platforms.  This is a very good implementation of the idea and the absolute best I've been able to find on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The game does a good job of walking you through solving the puzzles -- they can be pretty easy once you know what to do, but it's difficult to explain how to get to that point -- and the difficulty increases appropriately.  The presentation is pleasant and the controls are really good.  That's a hard thing to get right, as there's a dozen ways to do it and most of them involve tedious touching of each square.  This is doubly important on the Kindle Fire, as the touch isn't as accurate as I'd like for games like these.  There's even a very nice undo feature, which you absolutely will need and isn't usually offered.<br /><br />This is one of the few games I'd go and download immediately if I had to start over right now.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The popularity of the book and the reputed subject led me to believe it must be good.  Sophisticated<br />BDSM?  What's not to like?<br /><br />Bad writing.  Really, really bad writing.  It doesn't even have the decency to be technically inept.  The production values are fine: sentences are complete, paragraphs logically grouped.  But that just fools you.  Characters are silly but not intentionally so.  Plot points can be seen approaching from the horizon.  The content of the story, the drift, the meaning, the mood is pure Cool-Whip; vacuous, synthetic, devoid of nutrition or even real fat.<br /><br />The thing that's missing from this book is real feeling and standard issue adult credibility.  It seems to have been shamelessly ground out by a committee of middle-aged technical writers (of middling to lesser skill) to appeal to thirteen year old girls.<br /><br />It intimates larceny but dawdles so long on your doorstep, twirling it's hair and saying \\"OMG\\", that you must boot it out.  I couldn't make it past the first chapter.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This is one of the best RS232-USB converter I have ever found. works Flawlessly in vista and Win7...I spend so many $ on cheap Chinese brand rs232-USB converter in ebay...but none of them work properly(all comes with fake Prolific chipset)...until I got the name of the authorized dealer (Pluggable Tech) for Prolific chipset in USA from Prolific website
B005OOSPZO|5.0|Years ago a video rental customer brought back this movie and said, \\"Boring, boring, boring\\". I totally disagree. Yes, it can move slowly at times but it takes that to fully tell the story from both the Japanese and American sides. If you want a historical recreation, this film beats the modern romantic fairy tale hands down. An interesting contrast is the often overlooked, \\"The Final Countdown\\" a wild SciFi take on the Pearl Harbor story. You'll have to suspend belief for a couple of hours but given that it's a great ride.
030758836X|2.0|I have ADORED both of Flynn's previous books. I found them compelling and interesting and true \\"page-turners.\\"<br /><br />This one... I kept flipping ahead to see how much was left because I was bored, annoyed, and frustrated.<br /><br />None of the characters are likable, so you have no one to root for. And the angst which Flynn usually does so very well is simply obnoxious in this novel. These are not people anyone would like to be around, even in book form.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Nice graphics, good story line, puzzles are moderately difficult, good for casual game play.  Already have Snarkbusters2; for .99, I 'm looking forward to number 3!
B000001G1E|5.0|I got this box set almost 20 years ago, and it must be the greatest music purchase I've ever made. If you have an interest in James Brown I strongly recommend that you get this box set rather than the 1 or 2 CD compilations that you see around. I made the mistake of getting a 1 CD compilation first to save some money, and looking back I see that it missed so many absolute classics that it was a very poor representation of James Brown's career.  I should also say that I've bought many other compilations of James Brown's work, and Star Time is still the best. There's one set that breaks his career into different stages, and if you get all of them I think it works out as about 9 CDs of music (Star Time has 4) so you might think this is better. However, I think this is a bit too much if you're new to James Brown.  Note also that James Brown was never really about albums, so compilations are always the best place to start.<br /><br />If you enjoy Star Time, I strongly recommend that you check out the TAMI Show DVD which has an unforgettable performance by James Brown from 1964. Another CD to look out for is \\"In the Jungle Groove\\" which does not duplicate anything on Star Time, and so nicely complements it (the tracks that are common to both collections are different versions). There's also a 2CD compilation by The J.B.'s (James Brown's band in the early 70s) called \\"Funky Good Time\\", where James is more in the background but the music is still superb. Finally, I'll recommend the album \\"Doing their own thing\\" by Maceo and All The King's Men. James Brown sacked probably his best band in 1970, and they went on to record this album. Without James around you could really appreciate what a tremendous band this was, and what they learned from him.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|I got this app as the free app of the day a while back and it has been so helpful. it works great (as long as I remember to input my bills)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I refuse to spoil this book for readers, and so I won't say too much. Twists and turns. A seemingly perfect marriage that is really built on a mountain of dysfunction. Unreliable narrator and/or narrators. Words like buttah. Uncomfortable moments of recognition about my own expectations.<br /><br />There was a moment in the middle when I thought the writer was taking a wrong turn to a less interesting story. I was the one who was wrong! Want to recommend this book to ... everyone.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have just started playing the game this morning and so far so good. I am having a lot of fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good for when youre bored can get irritating sometimes... but most of all its pretty good... Some of the games are pretty annoying to get past but only a couple of them are like that

B005LY4B0A|5.0|great game like it easy at begging great fir kindle fire fun but challenging love the holiday levels<br /> cool fire idk how you can dislike this fun game
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great! I play it and so does my siblings. it is addictive and you will play non stop for a long time to come.
0575088273|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, despite the extremely far-fetched assumption that Africa, even in the 22nd century was the Earth's technology powerhouse.  I mean the only reason they have indoor plumbing and cell phones is because their former colonial rulers gave them these gifts.  It will be a depressing world indeed if Europe and the United States give up their technical leadership and cede it to the dark continent.<br /><br />Despite my misgivings, I borrowed this book from my local library and gave it a shot.  I just couldn't make myself believe that Africans were going into space, so I had to stop reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I luv it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! great game to play it is so fun you would really enjoy. you will have a nice expirence playing it
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fast paced and keeps me entertained on long trips and when I'm really bored. I highly reccomend that you get this app. I was truly blown away!! thanks kindle company!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|this app is easy to use and has cute pictures.  I wish it had more picture subjects available on the free app but love the flower babies.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is awesome and almost anyone can play it! I love it and it only lags when my kindle fire is almost dead.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I'm from Cleveland. I have been far from a Joe Walsh fan as you could get. I knew that he re-recorded a Michael Stanley radio tune \\"Rosewood Bitters\\" and made it more popular, but most consider it a \\"Joe Walsh\\" tune. I didn't realize that he was indeed part of the Eagles, even though I owned Hotel California and loved it. I knew he was a member of James Gang but couldn't mention any of his hits. I always loved \\"Life's Been Good\\" because they played it non stop in Cleveland. When \\"Ordinary Average Guy\\" got a ton of play, I thought he was a one note musician.<br /><br />Enter Howard Stern, and Joe's appearances with Sam Kinison and solo appearances. Plus his getting in trouble with the Eagles for performing something on Stern. But still, I was aware of him, not awake for him. Enter his Adam Carolla interview and then Howard Stern interview, and I thought to buy this.<br /><br />I now own 4 of his albums including another two on vinyl but will own them all. This has become a new standard for me, showing all the kiddies how rock and roll should be done. All seven of the first songs never let up. Wrecking Ball is a great rocker. Spanish Dancer is melodic and fun. One Day At A Time is also a rollicking tune.<br /><br />The last three tunes let the listener come down off the high of the first 7. Ahh, but the deluxe edition is the only way to go. (I had the non deluxe but traded it in for the deluxe.) \\"Fishbone\\" has that Joe goofiness that makes it a fun spin and then \\"But I Try\\" with Little Richard in 1971 form sounds great.<br /><br />The three song DVD is fun, but short. (Which is why I didn't buy the deluxe version at first.) It provides a few insights into the wonderful that is \\"Analog Man\\". All we can hope for is another album soon,, rather than 20 years wait. I guess learning to play guitar has made me really appreciate someone who can jam that Gibson...
B00785P2QC|4.0|its only flaw in my opinion is how long it takes to make money but its a cool game all round
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this because of all the hype that has been going around and all my friends told me I HAD to. Not being a huge fan of erotica books; this novel did not seem so great or wonderful to me. I enjoyed it and it did make me laugh, cry, smile in a naughty way and attack my husband of course but it also started off very slow. I am used to fantasy novels or suspense novels so this was enjoyable but not a favorite.<br /><br />I might check out the second book just to see if it gets any better. I did like the characters and would like to see what happens next but I'm not gnawing at the bit to do so.
B00881VLCE|4.0|love the many choices for puzzles.  a lot of free ones too. they take a while to down load but are worth it.  would recommend!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|I loved the app at first....nice layout, fast, a really cool app for my kindle. but after a while it has started to get very slow, and it freezes up my kindle fire for a while. Uninstalled :(
B006H8BIIM|1.0|What is going on with these dang apps?<br />I 'm sorry but if Angry Birds can be made and released as a free app with no in game purchases others should be able to as well!  Granted it became one of if not the most downloaded app but they never charged you to finish the game or buy upgrades in order to have a better playing experience!<br />How successful do you think Super Mario would've been if you had to send Nintendo a check before you could jump on the flag pole?
0802473156|3.0|This book contains a ton of great information to help keep your marriage on track or for starting a great relationship. There are certainly many different dialects to each of the five languages, and some of them spill into each other (affirmation into quality conversation, for example), but the information is solid.<br />The one thing I would caution is that it assumes you loved this person in the beginning. That may not be true for all marriages. Second is that it doesn't say you are going to feel love at the end of the day. You'll be expressing love to your mate through acts and words, but that is not going to guarantee that your mate will find you attractive or relate to you. Indeed, I think the chapter on physical contact is really straining it because if you are not physically attracted to a mate, you will force yourself to kiss or have sex devoid of the emotional attachment.<br />Certainly every pastor ought to make this required reading for pre-marriage counseling. This book is fairly religion neutral, so you don't need to be concerned about being forced to love someone from a sense of obligation to God. But it does treat love as a verb that demands action.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Now book three was the best of the three books.  What someone wouldn't do to be with the one they love.  Although Christian was the more \\"mature\\" adult, it was Ana who was the nuturing adult.  She had true unconditional love for her man which is what he needed coming from his pre-Grey background.  Finally I finished the trilogy and am glad that I continued on reading.
0307887960|5.0|EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT. I have tried every diet known to man but this one has actually worked! I have already lost 11 lbs and my husband has lost 16 in 4 weeks.  We're still in the cruise phase right now until we reach our goal (about 1/2 way) but I can't wait until Christmas when I can eat like a normal human being as long as I set aside one day a week to be true to the diet plan. Actually do-able as far as diets go with quick results.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I know it fun and all but before you play it name you create an account db or email. I chose email and know it says I need a password. I typed it in and then it say wrong?!help please. I clicked the forgot password and they never sent me my password...
B001F7MSG6|1.0|I like the first film, but somehow, between that and this film, the characters got annoying. Liz is whiny, Abe is a love-sick idiot who doesn't think clearly, and Hellboy cracks jokes that aren't funny.<br /><br />I have to complain most about Abe. I don't care about the voice; what bothers me is how he caves and gives the villain the thing he needs to awaken the Golden Army all because the villain threatens his own sister--Abe's newfound love. Okay, so Abe just met this chick, and anything the villain does to her happens to him as well, so he can't kill her. So...where's the conflict?<br /><br />Not sure if Del Toro caught that plothole or just didn't care. Either way, this movie is awful. I groaned more than laughed.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Now that I finished book one and moved on to book two the reading was much easier and better.  I started liking Grey and Ana more.  I was elated that Grey was willing to \\"try\\" to be with Ana.  I loved Ana with her young innocence.  She was an overthinker but I felt it was warranted.
B000002L7Y|5.0|One must always have a copy of this in your cd collection. Who doesn't like Take On Me? The other songs are great,too. Living A Boy's Adventure Tale,Hunting Hi and Low,Love Is Reason,The Sun Always Shines on TV,The Blue Sky,Dream Myself Alive. Artist today would be hard pressed to come up with this many potential hits on their new cd's.The cover photography is superb. Guys that good looking should be socially,legally,morally obligated to be nice to the rest of us and make hit after hit albums;which, they did. I'm living a boy's adventure tale in so many ways...aaaaah..haaaa..cue the synths.Also recommended Stay On These Roads and East of the Sun,West of the Moon.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is actually one of the best games I've played in a long time. i would really recommend it to anyone! if you like real life games you'll love this one!
B006RUJST6|5.0|When Lake meets Will I was totally feeling the love.  I actually thought \\"Man, this is so awesome, how could this go wrong?\\" THEN BAM.  Completely unexpected but awesome twist.  This book keeps you on edge, give you every type of emotion, and makes you fall in love.  I read the entire book in one day.  Then I instantly bought the second and that was finished the next day.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was a book club reading for me.  I could not get into the book and did not finish it before my club meeting.  However, I continued to read the book and was very interested to see where it was going.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|I thin-sliced the cover of \\"Blink\\" and thought it would be as good as Tipping Point by the same author.<br /><br />I was as wrong as the cops mentioned in the book, while this is not a big waste of time, I didn't get anything new from this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game. THis is the first time that I have reviewed any thing ;I give this game 5 stars.
B003ES61EE|2.0|It's the typical lens cleaning pen, except the wiping tip keeps coming off.  Frustrating because I'm afraid I'll lose it - eventually I probably will.  I'm having to constantly look for it lose in my bag.  They had a great idea of making two sizes for the wiping tip and made it removable so you can pick the small or medium sized chamois tip.  The problem with that is that it doesn't fit tight enough so it coms lose on its own.  The brush part works fine, it's adjustable and the bristles do not come off.  I would have loved to give this common product 5 stars, but I'm afraid I'm gonna lose the wiping tip eventually.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Hi<br /><br />I must say \\"Only in a book, would a virgin girl (or woman) find a man like Christian Grey. Rich and FREE with his gifting, Fine and a Nice Cold drink of Water, and with the ability to Sweep you off your fee, Literally (Charlie Tango). Aside from his flaws (in which we all have) and his (obviously) something that stems from a horrid childhood. Christian is every woman's DREAM MAN in some form or another. (well I'll take him (Flaws & All) (*:*)<br /><br />No One But Jesus is Perfect.<br /><br />I love the Chemistry between the two Christian and Anastasia. I'm not sure (at first) if it was \\"LOVE\\" but more rather LUST since the answer to everything was to SEX it out...I still enjoyed it, all the chemistry the smoke and fire the reverie. I even enjoy something as simple as them referring to each other as Miss Steele and Mr. Grey.. (owww so hot) LOL ;/<br /><br />\\"We aim to Please\\"&lt;--- emmpf stomps foot<br /><br />Why didn't I figure that out! you know the part about why all the subs \\"looked\\" alike, I mean I did think that had something to do with it but not in that way..

0062183591|5.0|Every one of us considers himself as honest. But are we really are?<br />Dan Ariely states one locksmith which says that door locks are there to prevent the vast majority to enter doors. 1% of people are truly honest, 1% is crooked and the rest of the 98% of people need locks to remind them to be honest.<br /><br />The book, in its fun way of writing checks the symptoms of our own honesty. With exampled tests it proves that all of us tend to cheat. But we are tended to stay honest to our self, so we deceive just a little.<br /><br />I was happy to see at the end that the tests were done in different cultures and found that we are all alike, even though we think differently.<br /><br />Dan Ariely is a gifted writer, this book is another fun to read on how we humans behave irrational.

1936891026|2.0|I just don't understand how this book got so many positive reviews. I've read and to me this is way too much esoteric talk saying things about \\"It was resistance!\\" and things like that and very few actual actionable stuff that you can use.<br /><br />Maybe I just didn't get it, but if you are anything like me (not very much into esoteric mambo jambo and like to get the facts) then I would stay away from this book.

0812973992|3.0|I'm reading this at the same time as the World War II novel, Kindly Ones, so, perhaps that has had an effect. Any other time maybe a \\"good\\" man's struggle with religion, purity, sex, and altruism would seem really important. I marvel at any character's ability to walk stonily, silently, away from a conflict. Real or in a novel.<br /><br />I'm put off by the fact that the narrator in the first part of the novel doesn't seem to have any kind of life of his own, reeling in his brother's pain seems to be the only thing he does. The story, however, is gritty and honest about the struggle to do \\"right\\". I absolutely love Tillie; can we have more of her, please?
0385737955|2.0|The Maze Runner is quite obviously a successful book that is directly targeting the teen mind:  100% teenage characters (not a single non-teen child in the story, not a single adult --'till the end, and they were throw away characters, unimportant), 100% impulsive actions, testosterone running wild, constant posturing, and so on.  And that is what it should be.  The story excites readers (teens) in ways that they tend to be excited, trying to find their position in life, what they are doing, where they are, why they are where they are, and so on.  But I was disappointed in the mix.  The one female character is flat, undeveloped, uninteresting, and the author does nothing significant with her.  She, too, seems to be another throw away character like the brief flash of adults at the end.<br /><br />My grandson (yes, I'm over the hill) found this book quite exciting and couldn't wait to buy the sequel.  I read it myself and understood why he was so anxious; Dashner is apparently writing a single book that he has broken up into a trilogy.  This book does not stand by itself.  It has no real conclusion, but leaves the reader holding the bag, wondering why he spent so much time on a story that doesn't really go anywhere.  Personally, I like my books to be complete, that have an entire story contained within the covers, such as the Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov.  Asimov builds complete characters and weaves a complex story line that leaves you satisfied at the end, regardless of which of the three novels you have read:  Each book stands alone.  But The Maze Runner stops in the middle of the story, ready to grab more of your hard earned cash so you can get still more of an incomplete story.<br /><br />Save your money and wait to buy all three of the books, then decide if you would like to part with that much cash for a single story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccWeather app is the best. Not only accurate weather and notifications for my area, but for areas to which I travel. Up-to-date and works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. I use it several times daily.
B004SEUJKU|3.0|Frankly, the first terminator movie is kind of bad. It is a great addition to a movie collection, but not as good as the rest of the franchise.
068484267X|5.0|Dazzled from the beginning of this book, so glad to have picked it up and started reading. There sometimes comes a book that you open it, and from the first sentence, you know that it is a good friend. This is that book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Okay, not to be a teenage fangirl but OMYGOODNESS. I CANNOT EVEN. OMGOSH. IT WAS SO FREAKIN GOOD. The actors were absolutely stunning, and the chemistry, and the character developments, and the effects, and the loki, and the powers, and the perfect deaths, yeah. okay. just watch it, join tumblr, and love Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Renner, and Mark Ruffalo.
037582913X|5.0|The Monster at the End of this Book is fun to read. Grover reacts to each turn of the page. He tries to persuade you to not turn the page again because when you do you get closer to the end of the book and didn't you read the title - there is a monster at the end of this book! The book has a surprise ending that is really cute.
B0079J28NW|5.0|One of the best Blu-Rays I've bought in a long while, probably since Star Wars came out on Blu.  The film was restored by hand and it shows.  Colors pop.. the visuals are just astounding.  Really.  You don't have to be stoned to marvel at the flashy, blinking and extremely colorful animation.  The sound is marvelous.  The songs never sound better.  Just imagine the remastered catalogue.. but all in amazing DTS audio.  The surround effects are really funny also.  My favorite scene is when they peel out in a car in the beginning and crash and its all in the left channels.. even the crashing metal *clink clink clink* sounds.  It was really funny.  The extras are all from the previous DVD, but thats ok.  This film is marvelous now and all thanks to the wonderful restoration department.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|A book that gets better and better with the turning of each page. Fell more in love with the characters, as well.
B002ZG980U|5.0|The two types of movies that hurt my head (but are so darn enjoyable) are those about dreams and those about time travel. So what about a movie that involves a dream within a dream within a dream? Stunning visuals, heart pounding soundtrack and brisk pacing of the movie aside, I really started getting lost the first time I saw this in the theater. But never one to miss out on adding a Christopher Nolan movie to my collection, I purchased the DVD without hesitation. The second time around was better as I could take the time to actually digest what the heck was happening. Great movie and instant classic.
B004132I20|5.0|I agree with Mr. Price's review.  I grew up on the Granada production of Sherlock Holmes staring Jeremy Brett.  This is the Sherlock Holmes that I compare all other performances to.  I was very nervous about the 21st century adaptaion of Sherlock, but my brother recomended it to me.  (We have the same taste in books/movies/tv).<br /><br />My 10 year old cousin was present while I watched an episode of Sherlock and even though he did not understand everthing, he was just as eager for the next episode as I was.  I can tell he will judge all future Sherlock Holmes to Benedict Cumberbatch's performance the same as I do regarding Jeremy Brett.<br /><br />I cannot add anything more that other reviewers have not already said.<br /><br />If you grew up watching (and loved) the Granada Sherlock Holmes, you will love this one too.
0345803485|3.0|Nothing spectacular. The writing it atrocious. The sex isn't even that kinky. And honestly...\\"cup my sex\\"? Why? WHY?!? BUT all in all it is an easy, mindless, beachy summer read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it!!<br />Its a very entratainig, you don't get tired of it, plus its just like Mario! which takes me back to my kidhood memories!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wanted to read the book that is making all of the headlines, but I am sorry thatI spent my own money on it. At one point, I just wanted to put it down and never pick it back up! And I NEVER put down a book without finishing it! This should have stayed on whatever fan-fic website it came from. The redundancy of phrases used coupled with the seemingly complete lack of editing make this book a complete waste of money. Is EL James a 15 year old? And honestly, I have read hotter sex scenes in the average Harlequin Romance novel. \\"Mommy-Porn\\" my foot! I absolutely hated this!
1878424319|5.0|This was an easy read (only a couple of hours.)  Brilliant and very insightful.  It makes you look at your relationships in a whole new light and gives you perspective on why you feel the way you do about certain things.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!

B005XIHSKO|5.0|The most outstanding new show on TV last season.  It was often a riviting TV show for a mature adult. No single episode all season was dull.  Outstanding! Emily Van Camp is outstanding in the title role. Joshua Bowman is very good as the love interest. Madeleine Stowe is outstanding as the fem fatale. Supporting cast meshes well with the the main characters. All well acted overall, and the show had very good script writing. Everytime one thinks they have the show \\"figured out\\", something new pops up.
1400069289|5.0|I was surprised to read one reviewer's comment \\"My chief complaint is that he really does not show you how to break bad habits.\\" This book clearly explains the \\"habit loop\\" involved in habitual routines (cue>routine>reward that relates to craving) as well as how to break a habitual pattern (become aware of the cue, routine and reward; then keep the same cue and reward + craving but change the routine). In the book's last chapter, he gives a demonstration of habit breaking from his own experience. He also shows how to use the habit loop to create a new habit, such as adding exercise to your life. This was as valuable to me as the information on breaking a \\"bad\\" habit. In addition, he gives some insights into the nature of willpower, citing scientific research.<br /><br />The author's chapter on Target and their collection of data on shoppers was interesting, insightful, and rather disturbing. The chapter on Starbucks and their approach to teaching good customer service was very interesting.<br /><br />I think this is a very valuable book. My main complaints (which are minor) are that the author is a little too repetitious at times, and some parts could have been shorter.<br /><br />As well as reading this book, because of recommendations by Amazon readers, I read Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength co-authored by Roy Baumeister (a scientist who is renowned for his research on willpower) and John Tierney and The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal (a psychologist who teaches a class on Willpower at Stanford University). All three of these books have something quite valuable to offer. Duhigg's book teaches the basic idea of how habits work, how to break them and how to create new ones. The Baumeister and Tierney book has numerous insights on willpower and how to develop it, as well as insights and tips related to setting goals and changing habits. The authors have a good sense of humor. McGonigal's wonderful book also has numerous insights pertainingto habits and willpower, but in addition, is a \\"how to\\" workbook for developing willpower and overcoming habit-related challenges. Her book, which has many valuable exercises, mirrors her course, and readers are encouraged to work with it, one chapter at a time, over about ten weeks (while they work on changing a particular challenge/habit they have). She has a great sense of humor and is a very good writer. While The Power of Habit teaches how to understand and work with habits, the other two books go deeper into the psychology of willpower/self-control and habits, and offer important and useful additional information.
B007P6VLRS|3.0|The pumpkins remain to this day my favorite band and this album did not change that fact. That being said, I, like many diehard pumpkins fans will buy just about everything that billy puts out without question. I think that was a mistake on my part with this album. As I write this I look at the 621 songs I get when I put \\"smashing pumpkins\\" into my music catalogue and I don't think I'd skip over very many even to this day. Ones from Oceania, though, probably....<br /><br />Sorry, for those that don't know, The Marked was Billy's first band before pumpkins. It's not great but check it out if you can find the songs somewhere. Anyway...<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that this album lacks the ability to connect with the listener like other pumpkins albums had. Even the Zwan album had this to a certain extent. The songs on here are passable and have some cohesive melodies, but most of it seems disjointed and insincere. There are few risks in the songs as well.<br /><br />The strongest tracks in my opinion are \\"Oceania\\" and \\"Pale Horse\\". Much of the first part of the album is utterly forgettable.<br /><br />I don't think Corgan's grand plan with \\"Teargarden\\" will end up making the impact he is hoping for. It's a grand idea (like many of his) but I just don't think he can write the same kind of great songs that he used to.
B006PHD0RW|2.0|this app os fun ive played it on my dads iphone, however its free on the iphone yet its $2.00 on the kindle that's stupid
1594744769|4.0|This was a good book.  It wasn't what I expected but still I enjoyed it.  It kept me wanting more so that's a good thing.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is definitely a child's book, in languague, characters and length. It is a modern fable, another take on a Brave new world and Logan's Run. In an unspecified place and time a society has opted to live in a world of sameness. Children are made in a nuturing centre, families assembled by committee. The story follows one boy, Jonas, who on reaching 12 is assigned to be the new receiver of memories. He gradually learns of colour, love and pain. This is a gem. Enjoy it at any age. Aparently it has been banned for children at some times as the some of the content, e.g. infanticide, is considered inappropriate . I can understand this as, reading it as an adult, the world it projects is a little scary and vivid. However, considering some of the things deemed appropriate nowadays this is rather mild. I loved this, am somewhat disturbed by it as some of the ideas are disturbingly close to issues today. It explores what happens when we discourage diversity. When conformity is celebrated and people receive complete nuturing of body and dulling of emotional extremes.
B007SGM084|2.0|First...<br /><br />I have to say that $30 is way too much for this download.<br />I read this trilogy and truthfully I don't understand what the buzz is all about. I have read similar books by authors such as Beatrice Small with similar content and story lines and have not paid near as much and I have enjoyed them far more. Lets face it, this is after all just a romance book.<br /><br />Second...<br /><br />Why is this a trilogy? It should have been 1 book!<br />I will most definitely NEVER pay $30 for another download. For that price I will buy the hard copy!<br /><br />Does Amazon give partial refunds?<br /><br />Sorry folks but it's most definitely NOT worth the price
B007SGM084|4.0|A very delishous trilogy book bundle, you don't want to put them down! Your spouse/significant other can appreciate the new increased appetite for something other than food!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome,I love it,its the best game ever!!!!!! you literally have to run for your life! the monkeys are sooooooo crash chasing you!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Not much to say in a review!  As a box set goes, it is just that!  What more could you want?<br /><br />The series itself is impressive.  I did not see it originally aired, and I zipped through the episodes.  I plan on getting season 2 which it is released, and will probably re-watch season 1 before I start 2, to catch up and see \\"what I missed\\" not that I see the full story.  I also got the books (on CD) to learn more of the story and see how close the show is to the books (I am told they did well, all things considered).
0062060562|5.0|This book had my heart racing! This is a great suspense/thriller that illustrates that we are nothing without our memories, that our past links us to our future in many ways that we take for granted. The story also made me wonder how my family would act in this situation....
B00846REIS|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews on this book before I bought it and I was discouraged to see that a lot of people said it was exactly like Fifty Shades, just with different names.  I gave it a try anyway and I'm glad I did.  Yes there were similarities, like a handsome, charming, controlling and filthy rich main character...but you can find that in so many other romantic/erotica novels.  In fact, FS is a carbon copy of Twilight, minus the paranormal element (EL James even copped to that).  I think BTY was a little better than FS.  The characters were darker and the sex scenes were hotter.  I'm glad I didn't listen to a lot of the reviews and I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B002I9Z8B2|5.0|By far the best \\"Trek\\" movie! Inspired by what is probably the best installment of the 1960's TV series, \\"Space Seed.\\" Ricardo Montalban as \\"Khan,\\" is one of the greatest protagonists in Sci-Fi motion picture history! His portraying of Khan, is just a magnificent brooding performance of single minded revenge! The scene where Chekov realizes he has landed on the planet they left Khan on, raises my neck hairs every time I see it!<br /><br />The ending battle & Spock's death were truly of epic proportion. I not afraid to say, I shed a tear every time I see Spock's death scene. The bond between him & Kirk & the rest of the crew as they watch his death is heart breaking. It's if my long time best friend had died, even though I know Spock comes back from the dead, & what can you say about the funeral at space? Truly heart rendering, even Saavik is shedding tears.<br /><br />Masterful film making!<br /><br />If you love this film like I do, then upgrade to Blu ray, yesterday!
0393088774|5.0|The fact that we are currently in a depression is a bitter pill to swallow, and I couldn't help but have a knee-jerk reaction to seeing the title. However, Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, Princeton University professor and New York Times columnist, does not give that title to his book just so he can get attention. He makes the case for why we are in a depression brilliantly (although not a Great Depression, he adds), and then proceeds to attack and debunk the common right-wing arguments against the necessary public investments that could easily end our economic problems. What makes this book great, rather than just good, is Krugman's ability to understand the human cost of our depression, and although he has perfect command of facts and figures, his passionate call to action transcends the academic world he and his colleagues live in, and shows his great compassion for the millions who have suffered economically. Few economists have been able to bring human compassion and sympathy into their work, and Krugman's ability to do just this makes him not just a good economist, but a great one. The only noticeable criticism I have for this book is that Krugman only devotes one chapter to specific solutions (beyond simply more government spending), although that is not criticism enough to take away the 5 star rating I give to this book. Bottom line: read it.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|This items works great. Currently in an area where it's hard to pick up wifi, but between the Alfa AWUS036NHR and the Alfa R36 repeater, we are able to pickup a wifi signal and distribute it around our work area. This combination has definitely improved our work environment.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like so many others, I heard rave reviews about this title and wanted to see for myself. What a complete waste of time and money! Wouldn't have even given it one star if I had the option. Forty pages of dribble worthy of a Harlequin Romance and then...more dribble. The sex scenes were not only a total let-down to anyone who has read erotica, they were also just plain BORING. My hubby and I are more exciting on a Tuesday night and we're in our fifties. There are soooooo many other great books, please do not continue to fuel this media-hyped snooze.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Zombie dice is a great game that any number of people can play.  The last time I played, there were 9 of us, from my 60 year old aunt to my 5 year old niece.  A simple game that plays fast and has tremendous replay value.
B004SGWYW4|3.0|As a female, I might be a little biased, but the main thing that irked me in this series is they made all the females stupid, big-breasted, men-dependent, and annoying. Also, there's a yuri-like scene in episode 6 where all the girls are grabbing each other's abnormally large breasts and they all somehow get drunk and flirt with the main character. Overall, the females are totally unrealistic in all means. I know anime is almost never realistic by any means but there's a difference having one stupid big-breasted female than them all being stupid and big-breasted. Also, come on! It's a zombie apocalypse and they're all wearing little to almost no clothing at all! One can tell this show was targeted for teenage boys.<br /><br />Another bad thing is that the characters are kind of shallow. You don't really bond with them at all like in other animes and they're forgettable. However, this might be because the anime is so short (only 12 episodes).<br /><br />One highlight is the animation; the animation is surprisingly really good. The characters are drawn really well!<br /><br />But to the point, the main reason I gave this a three-star is due to my love of zombie movies; that's what attracted me to this anime in the first place. I know zombies are all pretty much cliche but there's just some times when I feel like watching a good ol' zombie flick. This anime is perfect for that - lots of gore and zombie fighting action. In this anime, there's a little twist though, the zombies can only hear although the characters just keep on talking and yelling and the zombies walk around as if they heard nothing. I guess they're a little hard-of-hearing (haha).<br /><br />Overall, HOTD is perfect for \\"light watching\\" (example, a rainy day and you're just sitting around in the house), but if you're looking for a meaningful and/or memorable anime, this isn't it. Hope my review helped a little!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started reading Game of Thrones yesterday and can't put the book down.  It is one of the best books I have ever read!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun! I really enjoyed building the villages and creating families. I would recommend this game to people of all ages.
B008469DGY|4.0|just a fun game to play. challenging and entertaining. different levels of difficulty keep you interested and wanting more. good fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great idea for a game. It is both fun and addicting. But the only downside is on my kindle it always seems to lag once he starts running faster. (Usually past 2000 meters) . I dont have this problem on my iphone which gives great smooth game play. So if they were to possibly add a quality control in the options so you could optimize the kindles performance, it would make game play<br />on the kindle a LOT more enjoyable. But nevertheless, fantastic game.
067088278X|4.0|It is true, this book has a cute sing-song way of reading and the cover is cute but I am disappointed in the pictures on the inside.  A little too caricature for what I was looking for.  My nephew is 2 and hasn't quite found this one interesting yet.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An amazing book. I couldn't put it down till it was finished. I usually read pretty fast, but I managed to read this in three and a half hours! (beating my last Rick Riorden book time of four and a half)<br /><br />We get to see (well, read about) the long awaited reunion of Percy and Annabeth. To those of you who started on this series, I advise you to go and read the Percy Jackson and the Olypians, so this reunion will be even sweeter. If you read the ending of the last book, you'll be itching to read at least the first paragraph (or two, or three, or four) of this book. I won't say anything else, so the pleasure of reading that will be yours.<br /><br />As a warning to other fast readers, take it slow and make it last!! It's a cliff-hanger and the House of Hades won't be out till 2014!! This book is beautifully written, and I'm amazeed at the size. Seems like, guessing from the size of all the other books in the Heroes of Olympus series, House of Hades will be worth the wait!!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I heard it was an awesome game but I can not get it to down load I was so sad

0307730697|5.0|Fearless is more than just another book about the Navy SEALs.  It is the story of one man's journey from deep despair to peace with God, from failure to elite warrior.  Adam Brown's story is the timeless story of the prodigal son.  This is a book for fans of military literature as well as families seeking hope for their own prodigals.  Detailed accounts of SEAL training can be found in a number of books, but Fearless is the story of a SEAL, a husband, a father, and a friend.<br /><br />Eric Blehm masterfully weaves Adam's personal story with the story of his life as a SEAL.  Blehm was careful to get details from the lips of Adam's childhood friends in Arkansas, his family, and those with whom he trained and fought.  The timing of the book was providential; many who told their stories to the author were killed on August 6, 2011, when their helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.<br /><br />From football standout to drug addict, from recovery through boot camp and BUD/S, you will find yourself rejoicing in Adam's growing faith and marveling at the love displayed by his wife and parents.  This honest account includes his stumbles as well as his triumphs, since Adam wanted his story known in its entirety as a testimony to the power and sufficiency of the grace of God.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this book from WaterBrook-Multnomah Publishers for review.
B006H8BIIM|4.0|All of the folks claiming that IAP is &quot;required to win in less than 30 hours&quot; have missed three major things:<br /><br />First, 30 hours is *short* for a game like this. I have one that has no IAP at all, have sunk well over 100 hours into it, and am still nowhere near &quot;winning&quot;.<br /><br />Second, if you are trying to grind out every upgrade before advancing, you're doing it wrong.<br /><br />Third, even at level 3, you can earn credits at an average rate of roughly 40-60 a minute. How to accomplish this is left as an exercise to the reader, but I timed it a couple of minutes ago, just to be sure.<br /><br />So 4 stars from me. I think that some of the early upgrades *are* a bit costlier than the should be, but on the order of &quot;the balance is a bit off for smooth progression&quot;, not &quot;impossible without cash&quot;.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a fun game. Wonderful app to have. Lots of fun and it is very different from the other apps on my phone. Absolutely love it
0316044695|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but I was upset at the great loss of lives! The book really is about people dying, and how easy it is to kill. The people Marcus killed also have a family waiting for them, or rather were waiting for them. And did the killing of all those people really make a difference, or a multitude more just took their place? Is it right to glorify killing?<br /><br />The book is about a mission to Afghanistan gone awry. In between the action in Afghanistan, the author tells us the story of his life: how he grew up to becoming a Navy Seal. I liked the writing style of the author, and he manages to keep you captivated throughout the book.<br /><br />The best part of the book, and the saddest too, is when all four members of the Navy Seals are surrounded by the Taliban. Hundreds die in the issuing confrontation. Only the author, Marcus Luttrell, survives with injuries. His description of the events are in par with the best action books out there. I really couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />Another passage in the book that really affected me was the encounter of the Navy Seals with mountain shepherds. I was horrified to learn that the military mandates killing any civilians that might jeopardize a mission, and labels them as casualties of war; basically them being at the wrong place at the wrong time. In that particular passage in the book, however, Marcus refuses to kill them and lets them go. But that was a fatal mistake, for the Taliban soon surrounded them. Did the shepherds tell the Taliban of the whereabouts of the Navy Seals? And if they did, would that have justified killing them?<br /><br />How horrible war is!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very helpful and to the point. I was very frustrated with formatting issues, but the book helped me correct them.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I loved the story line in this movie, the cast, and the comedy.  I didn't think it was over the top hilarious, which actually made it really good.  The cast is wonderful and couldn't have been better.  Paul himself is super funny too.  I recommend everyone see it, as long as you like comedies.

B004LROUNG|3.0|Like other reviewers, I kept waiting for the twists and turns to start; for the feeling of \\"I can't wait to see what's on the next page!\\" Those things never happened. It was a fun read, and interesting, but not his best work.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|Positive:<br />The music was absolutely brilliant. Much of the movie was told by the music, which I liked a lot. The action scenes were intense and fun. They are pretty violent, but there were several \\"WHOA!\\" moments that I liked. I didn't mind The Driver's long pauses in communicating like so many other reviewers seem to harp on; Ryan is a great actor and can pull it off. The story is a pretty solid concept, and I enjoyed the execution of the movie. SPOILER: The scene towards the end where The Driver stakes out the restaurant wearing the set mask (with beautiful music playing) gave me chills. That scene was the best of the movie. I was floored.<br /><br />Negative:<br />Lots of plot holes. SPOILER #1: The Driver making out with the main girl in the elevator with a gunmen standing right next to them? WTF? That would never happen, and there was no reason for it. It seemed likely included solely to escalate the romance. SPOILER #2: my big \\"WTF\\" moment was at the end, when The Driver actually met up with the crime boss to give him his money back and got stabbed in the stomach. WHAT?! Why would he even allow that to happen? And he brought the money with him in the car? Talk about a classic Noob move. Any crime boss worth his salt would have had a guy stake out the parking lot and break into the car the second The Driver walking into the restaurant. Not to mention that the Driver allowed himself to be in a position to be stabbed. Why didn't he just shoot the guy as soon as he saw him? Stupid. Up until this last part, I was fairly entrenched in the movie. The movie dropped from 4 stars to 3 after I saw that.<br /><br />I also don't like the chick that played the main role. She sucks.
1594744769|5.0|I do not read often but this revived my love for it and even though the beginning is a little slow due to the plot being set, it quickly turned into a book that could not be put down. I read the last 200 pages or so in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. Everything came together. It was a magnificent book.
B008EQIK90|5.0|watched this on the ps3 app...streamed nicely and was an entertaining movie...if you have seen the previews you probably have a pretty good idea whether or not you will want to see this movie...there is a lot of humor and some action...
B007REAIUE|5.0|This is a great retro rock album that sounds really, really fresh.  JD McPherson manages to pay homage to the classics while putting his own spin of stompwater rock-and-roll.<br /><br />The best song is clearly \\"North Side Gal\\" but there's a lot of variety here.  \\"Your Love (All That I'm Missing)\\" could be described as elegant in the way it swings.  And the lyrics are very inventive.  \\"Scandalous\\" is all about \\"a high school Caesar and the Queen of the Nile.\\"  Just a great album from beginning to end.

0062124293|5.0|I AM A STRIDENT FEMINIST! There, I said it, as the author instructed. But it's true, and I have been, for as long as I can remember knowing what that even meant. And I have to say, this is the first \\"feminist book\\" that actually made me feel hopeful and happy and glad to be a woman. Others (such as \\"Crazy Salad Plus Nine\\" by the wonderful Nora Ephron) just made me angry - because so little has changed for women. We're still - 30+ years after she wrote it - marginalized and \\"different\\".<br /><br />\\"How to Be a Woman\\" explains this 'difference' in a no-nonsense and hilarious way. For example, in the chapter titled \\"I Encounter Some Sexism!\\", the author says, \\"We are, physically, the weaker sex. We're not as good at hefting stones, killing mammoths, and rowing boats. In addition, sex often had the added complication of getting us pregnant and leaving us feeling 'too fat' to lead an army into India.\\"<br /><br />The author honestly and unflinchingly looks at many topics that plaque women:<br />~what happens when puberty hits (the periods! the hair growth!)<br />~the 'thin' vs 'fat' issue (and how the term \\"fat\\" is used as a curse and a slur)<br />~sexism (in the workplace and out)<br />~falling in love, getting married, and having kids (why you should, and why you shouldn't)<br />~abortion<br />~the \\"maintenance\\" we have to do on ourselves (waxes, etc.)<br />~and getting older<br /><br />And it's all presented in an uplifting, positive, honest, and hilarious way. I did NOT want this book to end. And I want to give copies to everyone important in my life.<br /><br />A few notes - as other reviewers have stated, there is all kinds of crude language as well as mentions of drug and alcohol use, none of which bothered me personally, but... this is, obviously, not for everyone... and unfortunately many of the people who need this book the MOST may not read it because of this. (For instance, I would love to give copies for my niece {13} and goddaughter {10}, but I'm sure their moms would be none too happy with me if I did - because of the language.)<br /><br />Also, calling this the \\"British version of Tina Fey's 'Bossypants'\\" is a disservice to both books. The only similarities are that they are both by women, and both authors are funny, and both of them talk about their childhoods and careers. Otherwise, they are entirely different. Mind you, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Bossypants\\", but it does not have nearly the heft of depth of \\"How to be a Woman\\".  It's kinda like comparing cotton candy with a milky way.<br /><br />And finally, although the US publishers tried to \\"Americanize\\" the book, there were still a few things I didn't quite \\"get\\" and had to look up. (Now, this may have changed in the final version; I read an uncorrected proof.) A little more explanation could have been helpful.<br /><br />I highly highly highly recommend this book - and would give it 1,000 stars if amazon would let me.moms would be none too happy with me if I did - because of the language.)<br /><br />Also, calling this the \\"British version of Tina Fey's 'Bossypants'\\" is a disservice to both books.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|I read almsot all of John Le Craee's books.  \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" was one of his earlier books.  His early work was beautiful, wonderful prose, very complicated characters.  George Smiley is John Le Carre's alter ego and this character appears in many of the books.  George is smart, introverted and most respected by his ultimate enemy  - Karla - the head of the Russian KGB.  George has one weakness only and that is his wife Anne who he loves more than anyone and anything else in the world.  But they have their (marital) issues and it takes a book to read to understand why.<br /><br />I understand that Gary Oldman was nominated for the Academy Awards for his leading role in this film.  He totally gets the character of George Smiley as John Le Carre wants him to be: burnt out and jaded intelligence agent who keeps a lot to himself.  He is being played by his co-workers in a game where no one is really a winner.  It is simply amazing the accuracy with which Oldman portrays a man who is lonely, deeply unhappy and disillisioned.  There is only one moment in a film when we see George smile - and it is during a flashback when he recalls company party he and his wife attended where he just looks at her adoringly.<br /><br />But overall, this film is a mess.  None of the characters are developed and anyone unfamilar with the story line can possibly follow up what is going on in this movie.  There are flashbacks, action moves in Budapest and London that are difficult to follow because they are so disjointed. I am not even sure that the real feel of the cold war era is truly captured except for the brutali with which intelligence agent are killed  while in action.
B0086700CM|5.0|You know a lot of people have rated it there own but I rated it five stars because I don't like some of the peoples reviews and what the say about them.  I think some people should think about what they say and it is just a game and who cares because like I said it is just a game.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|So I got this app when it was a FAOTD, but you know what?  This is a game I would purchase.<br /><br />I can't beleive how many people have given this game a ONE Star reivew after saying how fun the game is.  ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEYS ZOMG!<br /><br />Really folks?  This game is better than some games that I bought for consoles and paid $50 or more for.  Even if you pay the $1.25 for the game, then pay the additional $0.99 to 'unlock' all of the features you've paid a whopping $2.24 USD.  BIG DEAL.  Again, that's assuming you pay to unlock the full game.... as opposed to PLAYING THE GAME, and earning the credits to unlock things.<br /><br />This game is a 4 or 5 star game.  Better than a lot of the RTS's out there for any platform.<br /><br />Read the 1 star reviews, see how many of them complain that there's a 'hidden' 99 cent charge.  It's completely optional, and in my opinion, not worth paying anyways.  Is that single thing worth knocking off 4 stars?  No, people are just being cry babies.  Space Station: Frontier is a five star game.  The fact that it's portable and costs between $2 and $3 dollars (depending on if you upgrade) only locks it's position.  Ignore the haters, enjoy the game.

0345803485|5.0|Received the book just a few short days after ordering it.  Loved the book!  The whole office has now read it and we all keep talking about it!
0765316994|5.0|Redshirts is an extremely funny and light look at life from a Crewmember's perspective.  While not Old Man's War, the book never intended to be so.  It's a fun quick summer book which may at times bring up obvious but ignored problems with Star Trek.  If not religious in you support of Star Trek and not demanding of an Old Man's War installment, you should find this a good read.<br /><br />If you're the type to be angry that your new Chevy Volt doesn't tow like your old Silvarado truck...please note that Redshirts never was secretive about what it aims to do. Read the book jacket before you buy and you won't look so bad complaining this isn't Old Man's War.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book and read it in just a few days.  The sexual content was a bit of an overload after awhile but the character development was great . I couldn't wait to get to next book and bought it right away.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I really hope that amazon doesn't sponsor the apps. I really wish amazon would never ever offer a free app of the day that requires you to pay more money. How about this, make great games and by word of mouth ( and good online reviews) people will buy them and buy the sequels.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is a good book and i felt it deserved five stars after i finished reading the whole thing. I recomend you at least give the first four chapters a try, but you may not be able to put it down after reading that far.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The plastic covering on the USB cable that came with the two Kindles I bought started to flak off after about one year exposing the bear wires underneath.  I ordered these as replacements and the plastic cover seems to be much softer (less brittle).  Have experienced no flaking with these and they work fine.  Recommended.

B004I744AS|5.0|Been wanting a dictionary app for my Kindle Fire,  gave this free one a try. I like all the extra factoids,  quotes on the first screen. To test it out I typed in one of the more esoteric words I know, &quot;syzygy&quot;, and the app delivered it right up like a champ!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|i enjoyed this album.At first i was skeptical about buying it but then i heard a couple songs and really liked it.

0307474275|5.0|THE DA VINCI CODE<br />  The Da Vinci Code, written by Dan Brown and published by Doubleday, is an intriguing piece of literature that grabs you from the first chapter and keeps you entwined within the book to the point I couldn't put it down for wondering what was going to happen next.<br />  It begins with the main character, Robert Landon, who is awakened in the night from a phone call about a murder of the curator at the Louvre museum in France. The attention grabbing saga unfolds as he discovers the body and the multiple clues that keep you puzzled yet curious. He is assisted by the French police woman and cryptologist Sophie Neveu who is also the granddaughter of the murdered curator. They begin to decipher the clues while being chased by the police and the secret society.<br />  As I was reading this great literary masterpiece, I was also searching the internet for the paintings and locations they carried that you through the story. The details of the clues kept me glued to the pages, following not only what I read, but seeing the images in my mind that I found on the web. As I progressed through each chapter, I found myself questioning the historical facts, wondering if there really is a cover-up within the church, and the validity of the secret societies that some of our founding fathers were said to belong to. The quest for \\"The Holy Grail\\" as the deciphered codes let them on, leaves you to wonder if it actually exists or is it just a symbol of religion. But then why are there the secret societies of the Knights Templar, the Priory of Sions, and Opus Dei? What is their purpose and relationship within the church? The historical accuracies and interpretations will make you wonder as to the validity of the history and the church.<br />  Without revealing the conclusion, this is a book that you must read, and then I recommend you follow up with the movie, where Mr Landon is played by Tom Hanks. This is one of the few movies that actually follow the book as it was written. Dan Brown is an exceptional novelist and writer that put your mind in his story. I still keep this book in my book shelf and have read it twice. Be sure to have internet access available when you read so you can look up the paintings, pictures, and clues that will prevent you from wanting to put the book down. You don't have to be religious to see what the author has found in the historical artifacts, but it will make you question religion.was written.

B003VS0CWY|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie although she doesn't understand it. She loves the music machine option, where just the songs along with the movie are played.
B003M0H4NG|5.0|I listen to this album and Herbie Hancock's Headhunters almost every day. I was a Miles fan for a long time and loved all of his early stuff, Sketches of Spain, Kind of Blue etc. I own about 40 of his albums and don't have time to name them all, anyway it took me almost two years to actually fall in love with Bitches Brew I had to train my ear to understand the genius of it. There are so many layers to this album's sound and if you listen through headphones you can almost pick each instrument out and you definitely feel the brooding atmosphere it creates. Think of the album as the soundtrack to film noir detective flick and your following a private eye around as he creeps up and down dark alleys or smokes cigarettes in a bar and gathers clues from the blue eyed beauty sitting next to him. For new fans or old fans if you don't have this album or haven't heard it you need it.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|this game sucks! there is only one good thing. there isn't very many adds. I get to like level 5 or 6 then its impossible!!! plus this isn't very good for kids. why would you teach kids to throw birds?
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is hands down one of the best mobile photo editing apps I have seen thus far.  A must have!
B0068FZ0YM|5.0|There are so many levels of this brilliant movie. Tho Heath Ledger was only 23 when he made this movie, he was completely believable as a torn apart reclusive father of a teenage daughter who has given up.  Obviously chemistry is the cornerstone of this movie, and the chemistry between all the characters was heartrending. Anne Hathaway was amazing and seemless as she became a disenfranchised wife who became cold as ice. Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as man who is trapped in a love that is not enough and too weak to accept what there is. Michele Williams' innocence is so fragile.  The scene in the kitchen where she reveals what she knows is so painful. If I try to do a full review of this movie, I'll be up all night and Amazon wouldn't have enough room.<br /><br />The conversion to Blu Ray is beautiful.  The vistas of mountains are so beautiful...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app because it makes you not bored. Some games are so stupid u can't stop playing it. Have Fun!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|loved it so entertaing and fun. love how you can produce family's and feed and love them then you make more spending lots and lots of money thats not real its a great time to spend
B004XQO90O|4.0|I was expecting very little here.  Maybe that is why I liked this so much, or maybe it is because the film is actually really good; I'm still not entirely sure.  It looked really stupid, some sort of action packed `Groundhog Day' and I'm still not sold on the idea of Jake Gyllenhaal being a good actor (his sister on the other hand is tremendous) so I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking \\"no need to see that\\" but then the reviews rolled in and word of mouth was good and so, with nothing better to do, the wife and I settled in for a watch.<br /><br />The basic premise is that Jake Gyllenhaal is a bomber pilot named Colter Stevens who has been recruited for a special mission where he relives the last 8 minutes of a terrorist attack victim's life in order to uncover who the terrorist was and how to prevent it from happening again.  He lives out those 8 minutes and then dies only to be rebooted back at the same spot to relive it again in an attempt to uncover as much information as he can so that they can save as many people as possible.  Once in his new body, Colter forms a quick friendship with Christina, a young woman accompanying his host, but his desire to help himself out of the situation and write his own fate (or be a bigger hero) begins to fray the edges of his mission.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal carries the film very well, but the entire cast is solid here.  Monaghan is a beauty (stunning, really) and she flirts in all the right angles.  Jeffrey Wright is perfectly creepy in his mysterious role, and Michael Arden slays his character's reveal.  It is Vera Farmiga though who once again solidifies her current status in Hollywood.  I just love this woman!<br /><br />`Source Code' is fast paced and exciting and uses its premise in a way that really works.  It also sets itself up for a sequel, one that I'll be anxious to see...so here's to hoping they don't botch that one up!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app it is great I use it for home, work,  everything.I carry my kindle with me everywhere so i no long have to look for little pieces of paper with reminders its easy to use. If your someone who is always looking for a pen you will love this app.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is so fun and addictive. I can't put it down. I don't like how you have to pay for certain things but it's a minor complaint.
B001N1DPDE|2.0|I respect the strength of the BK2 yet I find mine too much of generalist knife and too cumbersome. I prefer knives more task specific. If you can have only one knife it is an ok choice yet how often is that the case? For bush craft and general camp/trail use I'd suggest going with a lighter/thinner and shorter blade knife ie BK16 or BK17. For food preparation or camp chores consider the BK5 and/or BK15. For larger tasks such as chopping and batoning get a real chopper ie BK9, BK4, axe, or saw. The Becker handles are slippery weak when it comes to grip (especially if water or blood gets on them). The sheath is garbage. I have placed micarta handles on my BK5 and am buying a leather sheath for it. I find the BK2 to essentially be a heavy sharpened pry-bar. I plan on selling my BK2.<br /><br />The metal knife itself is fine quality. However, I do not like the Becker knife line that comes with smooth plastic handles and cheap plastic sheaths.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Loved it!  Lots of one liners that will be used like the hangover... Watched it with some friends and we laughed the whole movie...great flick!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I heard Love Never Dies for the first time with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess. And being such a huge fan of them both I thought the movie wasn't going to be good. I decided to round up a couple of my friends and we went to go watch LND in theaters. I became quickly absorbed in it. I literally cried in the beginning, the middle, and the end. I truly love The Phantom of the Opera and agree with others that it is probably Andrew Lloyd Webber's best work, but Love Never Dies is amazing. I never hated the idea of a sequel and I'm glad I kept an open mind about it. I do love the differences between the London and Australian version. Ben Lewis' deep voice was breathtaking, Anna O'Byrne's Christine was mature and believable and her Opera training came in handy, Simon Gleeson was excellent as Raoul, and I loved this version of Raoul better than the London one. The Phantom had some of his old characteristics that made him the Phantom, Ben's Baritone voice was simply beautiful. The movie was all together beautiful, with the music (which had some old Phantom melodies), the actors! Definitely one of my fave movies. (Review done by an 18 year old)

B005I4JG80|4.0|I have family from France and some still living there. I was interested in learning about the different parenting styles between France and the USA. I found this book quite interesting and I've highlighted some applicable tips.<br /><br />I've given it four stars because I feel like there's a bit of repetition. In any case, I'll definitely be reading this one again!<br /><br />Kindle can improve the book by numbering the last chapter and references  properly.
B0086700CM|3.0|Basically, I just got the app.I've played this before in an Ipod touch. however, I am still trying to check if it will freeze my kindle.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|It is hard to believe the Robert Downey Jr. of the late 1990s is the same actor in the lead role of this film.  He continues to impress me with his matured and diverse acting ability.  The way he has turned both his life and career around are very admirable.  I am not going to say much about this film, except you should see it if any of the following applies to you:<br /><br />You like watching films starring either Robert Downey Jr. or Jude Law<br /><br />You enjoy action movies, because this sequel is probably a bit more action oriented than the first film, though not in a bad way.<br /><br />You are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's mysteries or the Sherlock Holmes character in general<br /><br />You enjoyed Raiders of the Lost Ark, other films from that series, or that type of action/adventure<br /><br />This is a very well made motion picture that just keeps rollicking along until its climax.  It proves to be a lot of fun along the way and has a decent storyline.  Jude Law and the other supporting actors and actresses do a fine job, but Robert Downey Jr. makes this film, in much the same way I thought he dominated the screen in the Iron Man films and the recent Avengers film.<br /><br />I watched this on a home theater with a 60 inch screen and full digital surround, but it still would have been better served in the theater.  I am usually not a fan of sequels, but I hope they continue producing this series and keep it fresh.  The first two films have been well above what passes for the current Hollywood average.  I am sure I speak for many admirers when I say I wish Robert Downey Jr. continued success and look forward to seeing some of his future work.
0345803485|1.0|Against my better judgement I relented and downloaded this drivel.  There are many other reviewers who adequately describe the terrible writing, so I don't think its necessary to repeat it ad nauseum.  I do want to add that I'm not sure what has anyone hot and bothered as I didn't find the sex scenes sexy or erotic in the least.  I was so bored by the repetition and silly dialogue that I just wanted it to end.  Needless to say I have no interest in reading the rest of this crap.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Let's put it this way.<br /><br />I wrote Amazon an email to ask them to create a zero star button just because of this movie.<br /><br />It was bad.<br /><br />Real Bad.<br /><br />Rent/Buy something else. Your welcome. Just saved you 2 hours of your life.

0143118757|4.0|The title of Fisher and Ury's book is Getting to Yes - Negotiating Agreement without Giving In. It's a case where the title clearly lays out what the book is about. In Getting to Yes the authors present, step by step, how to find your way to a win-win solution that helps meet your goals while at the same time preserving the relationship so that future negotiations also go smoothly.<br /><br />This book was the assigned textbook for a college course I took on negotiation, but it's one of those fairly rare cases where the material that's useful for a college course is also immensely useful for off-the-street people in a variety of situations. This book avoids complicated jargon and long, droning background chapters. Instead, it plunges into helpful information to assist people in negotiating for a new car, negotiating issues with their landlords, and all the many ways we all negotiate for our position throughout life.<br /><br />Negotiation isn't just for union leaders trying to avert a strike. All of us negotiate each day as we try to juggle our many roles. We negotiate with our co-workers over assignments. We negotiate with our family members over chores. In an ideal world all of those discussions would go quickly, smoothly, and with as little strife as possible.<br /><br />Getting to Yes provided numerous helpful examples which made their points more easy to understand. It is so true that people tend to remember stories where they might not remember dry text. When I think about this book I do remember several of the stories clearly, and those help to represent the points the authors were making. The stories help remind me to focus on the issues when negotiating and to look for objective standards to work with.<br /><br />The information presented is wonderful, and immediately useful in life.<br /><br />On the down side, this is a new version of older material. The authors chose to keep the initial book in its original form and then add on additional information at the end. I appreciate for historical reasons why they wanted to do that. However, from a fresh reader point of view, I feel they should present an integrated whole which most clearly presents the full information. The way the book is laid out currently, you have to go back and forth to find all information on a given topic.<br /><br />Also, the format is not laid out for easy reference. If they went more for a \\"dummies\\" style with an easy to scan layout, graphs and charts to quickly find and scan, and quick end-summaries, that would make this more useful as a reference book to keep on a shelf. Right now if I had an issue to handle it would be less than quick to grab the book and find the answer. I would have to wade through the book to figure out where to get the support I needed.<br /><br />Still, I do recommend that everyone read this book at least once, to build their skills in negotiation.

I ordered this thing Saturday night along with a 120GB Mushkin SSD and selected 2 day shipping (since it's free with amazon prime.)  So I was expecting to get it on Thursday (since Wednesday is July 4th).  Well I open up amazon on Monday and it says I should get it Tuesday!!!  So I'm initially excited right there.  I go and check the mail and HOLY CRAP!  It's Monday and I already got it.  Amazon's so awesome.  :D
B005LAIH54|3.0|Awesome special effects don't always make a movie great.  Such is the case for WRATH OF THE TITANS, the sequel to the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS.  The storyline, thin as it is, focuses on demi-god Perseus' attempt to rescue his deity daddy from the clutches of Hades, Ares and the fiery Kronos.  The film's pacing is good, but I wish there had been a few more monsters!  The film manages to include the mechanical owl Bubo from the original 1982 Clash...its brief but cleverly used.<br />A collection of talented actors are given little to work with but nobly acquit themselves:  Sam Worthington, Edgar Ramirez, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Toby Waddell and Rosamund Pike.<br />The climactic showdown with Kronos must be spectacular in 3-D which I am not fortunate enough to possess.<br />WRATH is passable testosterone entertainment...you could do worse!  Or better!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a tremendous addition to the dystopian genre. From the moment I started reading, I was completely engrossed. The world of the Silo felt so *real*, I could practically hear the steps resonating on the metal staircase. The book scales very well, by which I mean that the ideas are broad in scope, but the interactions between the characters feel very real. You can't sell big ideas without having believable, interesting, and flawed characters, which this book has in spades. I can't recommend this book enough. Well done, Mr. Howey!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Just watched this movie and I must say this omg I loved it super packed with action fighting blood killing and it's a cartoon lol this cartoon is 17 and up this is truly not a kids movie but a must watch if your a batman fan like me and I have been one since I was 6 years old and i'm 24 now and no i'm not a nerd lol but this was super crazy cool movie

B004H1V5RU|4.0|Regardless of this toys SUPER cheap construction, IT IS A BLAST to play with.  I'm a grown man and I can't help but play with this toy at least a couple times a week to try beating my old record (I've made it to 28).  It is extremely difficult, frustrating even haha, but excellent fun.  I would gladly pay a higher price if the Epic was built out of stronger materials ie thicker/stronger plastic like ABS or something.  Mine hasn't broken yet because I am extremely careful with it... but it is blatantly obvious by simply touching it that if you were to drop it on a hard floor surface it would break. The epic is awesome to get you or your kids away from the xbox for a few minutes a day haha :)

0062183591|4.0|I first learned of Dan Ariely through his TED talk (highly recommended, available at [...].  I was interested in learning more about his research and I ideas, so I was very happy to get this book.  Ariely presents very intriguing results, much of which is personal anecdotes and his own research.  I wish he had drawn on others' research - I am not that familiar with the field, but this book seemed rather one-sided in some ways.  For example, I would have appreciated more insight into ethical decision-making and moral reasoning as a back backdrop to the behaviors Ariely describes.  All in all, it was a very engaging and recommended read.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I'm Loving this game so far. I've been playing for quite a few hours and upgraded my station quite a bit and even have played endless mode for awhile.<br /><br />Yes there is an \\"In-App\\" purchase. For 99 cents you can avoid playing the game and get a fully upgraded station. That's the only In Game purchase I've seen.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm finding it fun and challenging and as I'm able to buy upgrades I'm able to last longer in endless mode and earn more credits.<br /><br />The gameplay concept is fun and enjoyable.

0345803485|5.0|I had to read this as there was so much hype on the whole trilogy.  I really enjoyed her writing style.  While it is somewhat erotic, I did not find it at all objectionable.  Rather, I found it very interesting.  I ordered and received the second and third of the trilogy and I am half-way through the second and I am enjoying this too.  I think they are quick reads, even though each is over 500 pages.  It goes quickly and one is anxious to find out what makes this guy tick.
0345803485|1.0|Honestly I have never written a book review but this book has made me do so.  I stupidly bought the first two books as I was going on vacation.  I read the first book constantly wondering why I am still reading it but hoping it gets better, it didn't.  The second book is even worse.  This is the worst written piece of shallow, mindless and predictable writing I have ever read.  I am not a reading snob, I read pretty much everything, but this was so dumb, I am really concerned and ashamed at how many women LOVED this book.  Worst book ever, seriously, do not waste your time or money....
0385344228|4.0|I thought this was very good.  It is a little dark insofar as the son's personality but, overall, I thought it was a very interesting read.  I am recommending it to my book club and also lending it to others to read.  While the ending is a surprise, it wasn't really a shocker.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|Men in Black is my one of my favorite movies of all time. It came out when I was about 5 and I have watched it maybe a million/ a million and a half times. Although I liked Men in Black II (as opposed to most critics, who despised it)it definitely fell short of the original. I am happy to say that, in my personal opinion, Men in Black III was totally awesome - totally deserving of the MIB title.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />It made me laugh (a whole bunch- this movie was seriously the funniest movie I have seen this year) and it made me cry at the end.<br /><br />TLJ and Will Smith have such great chemistry - it's unmatched by any other buddy comedy I think I've ever seen.<br /><br />The one sad thing: Tommy Lee Jones is not in the movie very much. However, Josh Brolin does a picture perfect impression of a younger him- it's fantastic.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, I am telling you to rent see this movie. It's just awesome!
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This movie is not just a classic story put to motion, it's a great example of director Wes Anderson's style. Action, suspense, and many laughs await viewers ages 4 and up.
B0086700CM|5.0|very well done app. I spend hours hooked on this one!  pretty cool its a free game and such a high quality
079073804X|3.0|I just happened to see this movie on TV for the first time at 69, almost 40 years after it was shot, not being a fan of horror movies (unless by Polanski and the Hammer studios) and trying to postpone the real horror of filling in my IRS declaration.<br />Well, movie nicely shot and acted, though a bit slow, good transfer - but what about the plot! How come catholic priests can exorcise a Sumerian demon out of people who do not believe in either of them? How come obsession must always be obnoxious (spit, vomit and bloody abrasions) and obscene (well, given the catholic view on sex, what else)? Why does the obsessed have to be a girl in puberty?<br />Wrong questions? Look at your reviews slobbering on regaining faith, sorry: Faith! That much for not confusing facts and fiction. I don't, but they might.<br />Fiction or not, I'd like to have its bias declared. For real horror, dig into the history of the Roman church among others.
B0086700CM|5.0|idk what everyones problem is. I like it and it works fine on my kindle fire.. and nope this isn't fake
B005LAIH3G|4.0|First off:  Props to the publisher for providing a real digital copy and not that Ultraviolet junk the other publishers are doing.  This is why I bought the film instead of just renting it.<br /><br />I was unable to see this in the theaters, new kid was born about the time it came out, and I just couldn't find the time.  I had a few friends that were raving about the awesomeness of the film and I wanted to see it, combine that with a combo disk + free true digital copy and I impulse pre-ordered it.<br /><br />I sat down and watched the film and while this isn't a huge culture changing film it was an excellent movie.  Speciall effects were seamless, and not having heard of/read the original stories I had nothing to compare it too as far as source material.  Though I am now going back to read the originals.<br /><br />I found it to be a great film.  Even with a twist ending I was not expecting even.  Just a very enjoyable story that while not science based much at all it was a great movie.  I enjoyed it and am quite happy to have this in my personal library.<br /><br />I didn't watch the 3D version, so I have no idea on that part of it.  3D as it is today is a joke.

1439153663|5.0|Initial Thoughts:<br />This book came highly recommended to me by my mom. She said that if I liked The Help, I would love this one.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />The way that Grissom weaves us into the world of the Kitchen House is incredible. I had perfect pictures in my mind of how everything was laid out, even down to peoples' faces, which doesn't happen often when I'm reading.<br /><br />Sweet, innocent little Lavinia grows so much in this book. Her innocence can be a downfall, however. I just wanted to wrap her up in a hug and never let go.<br /><br />The idea of family is really questioned in this book. Just because someone isn't related to you by blood, doesn't mean that they aren't your family. And vice versa.<br /><br />I felt like this book really educated me on the time of slavery. There's only so much you can learn from history books.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />The violence in this book is unsettling, but necessary. And unfortunately, there are many instances of violence in this book.<br /><br />My hatred for Marshall almost made me stop reading this book.<br /><br />The Wrap Up:<br />This book is amazing. If you like historical fiction, you will love The Kitchen House. I can't wait to see what Kathleen Grissom comes up with next.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"What the color is, who the daddy be, who the mama is don't mean nothin'. We a family, carin' for each other. Family make us strong in times of trouble. We all stick together, help each other out. That's the real meanin' of family.\\"

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I hate giving 1 star reviews, but I cannot understand how this book became so popular.<br />It really must have been a case of; Right place, right time. Or perhaps just dumb luck. Either way, who ever was in charge of marketing this book did a damn good job seeing as this novel just broke the record for fastest selling book in history. Really? REALLY?!<br /><br />Honestly, I have lost faith in humanity! There are so many other books out there that are 1000 times better, but don't get noticed at all.<br /><br />Firstly;<br />The characters are unbelievable. The female protagonist, Anastasia, is a stock-standard Mary-Sue, joining the ranks of Bella Swan, and other 'perfect' women.<br />The male lead 'Christian' is perfect too. Rich, handsome, well endowed, and an excellent lover. Anastasia orgasms on almost every page of the book. All Christian has to do is look at her the right way, and she creams in her panties.<br /><br />Everyone is SO perfect, it is enraging!<br />Really, this book is worse than Twilight.<br /><br />This reads as if it is a fifteen year old girls fantasy.<br /><br />Apart from the boring characters, I didn't think it was very well written at all. The language was repetitive, and childish.<br /><br />The people who love this book mustn't have read much erotic fiction, because I found this neither sexy, nor titillating.

0061438294|4.0|This was my first book about the topic of body language and I must say it was very interesting and clearly put into words. The text together with images to illustrate a meaning, I found the book a joy to read and a superb introduction to the topic.<br />As a follow-up, I'm now reading [[ASIN:0091922119 The Body Language Bible: The Hidden Meaning Behind People's Gestures and Expressions]]. I'm almost half-way in reading this one and I'm glad to have read Mr. Navarro's book first.
B005LAII08|4.0|\\"Brave\\" is Disney/ Pixar's newest animated wonder, a wonderful story about the young and fiercely independent Merida, Scottish daughter of Queen Elinor and King Fergus.  The story is solid but doesn't break any new ground here: we have the princess Merida who takes after her rough-and-tumble dad and would rather hunt quail than knit mittens.  This puts her at odds with her means-well mother who is trying to teach her how to be a royal (think \\"The Princess Diaries\\") but Merida, whose untamed and unruly spirit is matched by those gobs of red firebrands that make up her hair, wants none of it and defies the convention of being married off to one of the sons of the heads of the opposing clans.  Because that's just not fair.  And herein our heroine asserts herself and does something very modern: she enters the challenge for her own hand and wins.  The rift between Merida and her mother comes to a breaking point and Merida makes use of a witch's spell to try to get her mother off her back (think about the storyline in Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid\\").<br /><br />The story picks up from here as Merida's mum becomes (what else?) a literal mama bear.  There's some fun here and we have a great deal of sympathy for Queen bear Elinor.  But this was just the trick to help mom and daughter bond, albeit it's a little saccharine, and Merida discovers her love for her mom while her mom discovers the value of Merida's independence.  (Some of this recalls the wonderful and underrated \\"Brother Bear\\" movie.)<br /><br />The real focus of this film is on the fierce bonds (including the fierce pulls and pushes) between mother and daughter, between the mama bear and her cubs.  She is, after all, willing to die for them and the mama bear is a tried-and-true caricature of what people and circumstances should not do in coming between her and her offspring.  This aspect of the story works in \\"Brave\\" even if the other aspects of the story and humor aren't up to the usual Pixar standards.  It is still better than most of what else is out there.ill better than most of what else is out there.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I don't even know where to begin.  There are some books you read that will stay with you forever, stories you will still be thinking about 30 years from now.  There are 3 books out there like that for me.  Slammed and Point of Retreat are 2 of them.  You FEEL the characters, they make their way into your heart and soul and stay there.  Colleen has a way of writing that not only allows you into the minds of the main characters, but makes you enamored with the supporting cast as well, and that is rare to find in a book.  I love every single person in this novel.  Being the true poet that she is, the words flow seamlessly throughout the pages and you will find yourself suddenly at the end, begging for more.  Luckily there is Point of Retreat to quench that need.  Beautifully written, carefully thought out, I cannot wait for more by Ms. Hoover.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|I won't bother to repeat the spoiler oriented reviews. I'm just going to say: if you like some cleaver humor with your sci-fi, this is the book for you. Yes, we all know this is a spoof on the guys in the red shirts who die on Star Trek away teams. It's an old joke (especially for those of us old enough to have watched the show before it went into reruns.) So when dealing with an old joke, it's all in the writing - and Scalzi does it well. Not just in the humor (tho' he does that quite well, thank you) but also in bending our minds around the Alternative Reality of it all...oh so Meta. Some may find this \\"too cleaver by half\\". But for me, it was just right. What will he come up with next?
B0086DBE62|1.0|I cancelled the order one day before it became available when it was emailed that I would receive Instant Viewing instead of the actual DVD, as I expected.

I heard it once all the way through online and came right over here to Amazon and pre-ordered it.

B005UMWFIS|2.0|This was my first Stephen King book...and probably my last.  While the material was interesting and captivating, the way the story was written was not optimal.  I hated the colloquial nature of the writing \\"aint\\", \\"miz. Mimi\\", \\"cuz\\", even though these were explained.  It just didn't strike me as high literature.<br /><br />I found the book far too long - like King was trying to compete with Vikram Seth with fewer well-developed characters.  I found Deke Simmons and Ellie under-developed, as were Christy and even Sadie (beyond the fun-loving but fragile woman).  Beyond the one-dimensional characters, the plot was interesting but far too drawn out.  I started skimming at one point, losing track of how many times I'd seen the words \\"obdurate\\", \\"harmonizes/harmonic\\", \\"poundcake\\", \\"the past does not want to be changed\\".  It was very, very annoying.<br /><br />I would not really recommend this book.  And I won't be picking up Stephen King again.

B005LAIGIM|4.0|I just RedBoxed this movie on the strength of the previews and at first it was not looking like it was going to be very good.  No I did not feel like I was going to turn it off but I was not getting very amused either.  Some of what was supposed to be funny amounted more to Murphy's character making a fool of himself in a way that made my viewing experience awkward.  I actually felt embarrassed for the character.  There were some funny parts but the movie takes a turn into some very emotional tear-jerking territory that overshadows the comedy element.  Another reviewer compares this movie to Adam Saddler's \\"Click\\" effectively beating me to that comparison.  With a little editing, this film could easily be made into a Family Movie as it explores the elements of \\"finding oneself\\" and finding what really matters before it's too late - not necessarily actual death but losing out on what really matters but yet is taken for granted until it's gone, you know, the ages old \\"You never know what you have until it's gone\\".<br /><br />A pet-peeve of mine was the dumb Starbuck's Batista being a huge Beatles fan but even this becomes part of the emotional element of this movie when Jack McCall, who is normally 100% self-absorbed and not able to see a foot ahead of his own hide, is moved to find and buy an original pressing of the White Album on vinyl - possibly a pretty penny.  For McCall, this would be akin to \\"Hell freezing over\\".  As the few remaining leaves fall away, Jack is coming to value what he never gave as much a parting glance prior to the \\"curse\\".  We see how time wasted on petty things such as cutting ahead in a long line for coffee, fighting to keep the house of his dreams or not getting his car parked under a tree come back to haunt him and become sources of regret that may very well be etched in stone.  The tree ends up losing all of it's leaves.  Of course this has to be a funny movie with a happy ending.  However, we know that reality does not usually afford us that luxury!!!!that luxury!!!!

B005LAIH54|5.0|As a person that really enjoyed the 2010 Clash of the Titans remake, I was eager to see the sequel, the Wrath of the Titans. I was not disappointed. In some areas it surpasses the original. The special effects are absolutely stunning. The creatures and monsters that Perseus does battle with are rendered with breath taking photo realism . This self professed CGI junkie is very happy to be living in an age when the special effects have reached this quality.<br /><br />Similar to Clash of the Titans the move has an uncomplicated straight forward story. It is also more of an action adventure tale than the first one. At the start of the movie we find Perseus living the quiet life with his young son. His wife, Io, has passed away. One day Zeus appears to Perseus saying he needs his help as the power of the gods weakens through man's disbelief. Perseus refuses until hell breaks loose and Zeus is captured by Hades and Zeus's son Ares who is jealous of the way his father has favored Perseus. With the help from Queen Andromeda and others Persues embarks on an epic quest to the mountain of Tartarus where Zeus's father, the Titan Kronos, has been entombed and where Zeus is being held and drained of his power.<br /><br />This movie also had a bit more comic relief and humor than the original and this makes it a more lighthearted, fun and entertaining experience. The acting is fine and the all-star cast brings an otherwise straight B movie up a notch or two in quality. Movies like the 2010 remake and this sequel remind me of the 50s golden era of science fiction, fantasy and sword and sandals movies. Those were all B grade moves but still a lot of fun. So I view the Titans franchise in the same light and as long as they're enjoyable like this then I say bring on part 3!

B004DH8IK0|5.0|For starters, I'm not usually a DnB guy. But this album makes me love what the genre can do. Its an amazing album as a whole, perfectly blending DnB and Rock, with Rob Swire's vocals featured, but not in front of the amazing production, as I see too often in Rock. Standout tracks are Watercolour, Crush, Witchcraft, and The Island (both parts).<br /><br />However, after such a great start, the second half of the album loses a bit of what made the first half so special. That's not to say it isn't awesome, just not quite as awesome as the first half in my opinion. This is the album that got me into Pendulum. I went back later and got In Silico and Hold Your Colour, both great albums. But this is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Buy this album. If you're anything like me, you'll love it.

0439023513|1.0|When reading the first two \\"Hunger Games\\" novels, I came to love the strong, engaging characters. The first two books offer such a winning trifecta: Katniss, at once fiery, smart and kind; Haymitch, damaged dispenser of wit and wisdom; and generous, selfless Peeta, who in my view is the moral center of both \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire.\\" Yes, there are other good characters, but they don't get in the way of these three -- they support.<br /><br />In the final installment, Collins abandons this perfect chemistry and opts for a much bigger montage. Peeta and Haymitch disappear for long, long stretches, replaced by a new cast that fails to engage and is at times so large, it's confusing. As part of this change, Gale, the poorest-defined character in the first book, finally emerges as a bit more than the two-dimensional sketch he previously was. It's nice of Collins to finally give him a character, but he's not really someone who makes you want to keep reading. And Katniss? The fire is still there, but the smarts are gone, and a lot of the kindness is too. She has a few good moments, but in pivotal scenes with someone she's supposed to care about -- a key character to whom she owes her life several times over -- she comes across as a self-absorbed mean girl and, even more inexplicably, she never atones for it. She's also not terribly nice to unarmed civilians, or a certain military/political leader she suspects of corruption. In all of this, she's frustratingly inconsistent. For example, as it turns out, despite her frequent statements to the contrary, Katniss has no real problem with murder when the mood strikes. In at least one case, this is doubly perplexing because she has an obvious alternative: As we're told repeatedly, Katniss has enough \\"star power\\" in her country to command an audience and influence people with ideas. But brutality is the order of the day. If you're looking for the girl who, through the Hunger Games, learned something about respecting life, even the life of an enemy, you will not find her in these pages. Instead, you find someone shallow and weak, who rushes to hide in closets when things get tough, emerging only when indiscriminate thoughts of revenge pull her out. Compared with the previous books, her only really consistent character trait is her hotheaded-ness, and it's a lot less attractive now.<br /><br />If that's not enough, there are other problems. The plot meanders like a screenplay that's been written and re-written by a team of 10 writers. If you enjoyed the clean, suspenseful storytelling of the first two books, all I can say is remember it fondly, because the plot of \\"Mockingjay\\" is convoluted, logic-defying, and at times boring. Also, some of the prose is confusing. There were passages in this book I had to read over two or three times before giving up on their meaning and just going on.<br /><br />To Collins' credit, I think she was trying to write a more complex novel than she'd ever done before, and there are some admirable things about the book. But it just doesn't work. With the inexplicable turns and the warping of characters we'd come to know and love, it almost feels like someone other than Collins wrote \\"Mockingjay\\" and we're still waiting for the real series conclusion. I can honestly say I wish I hadn't read this book because it taints my memory of the first two.life, even the life of an enemy, you will not find her in these pages.

0140120416|4.0|This Russian course is very thourough, but Russian grammar is quite complex, and this book reflects that. Ideally it should have come with pullout cards with the individual grammar rules that you could pin on your wall. On the plus side, it does a very thourough job of explaining the Cyrillic alphabet, which is something that is lacking in, for instance, [[ASIN:1118127692 Russian For Dummies]]. Even here, certain things are confusing though - I still haven't really grasped how the soft sign is pronounced.

I thought that the first 2 movies in the series were good, especially the 2nd one with AJ Cook. You could argue that 5 is the worst of the bunch with unconconvincing plot details around the death scenes, and also a poor overall story. It lacks the gory charm of the first movies where we wanted to see how somebody received the deep six. The characters are extremely shallow and we never are able to build any connection with them. It leads to a bland plot, bland characters, and a feeling that we need to finish up the movie quickly. I think that this movie is really for only fans of the series. The mnovie is worth seeing if it is free (ie cable) but I certainly would not buy the blu-ray.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is the first time I have encountered hidden-object games,  so I might be a bit biased by the novelty. Graphics are detailed and interesting; orientation, size, and color can change,  making it quite challenging to locate objects.  I used hints liberally,  but I still had over 100 left at the end of the (untimed) game. There are interludes with other simple games,  including picture puzzles with transposing or rotating pieces,  find-the-difference, matching, and untangling puzzles (though I really wish there had been instructions, since I never did figure out what to do with the non-web objects--fortunately for me,  there's a skip key.)  As other reviewers have noted,  the dialogue explaining the story can get tedious. I went through the whole game in several hours over two days; it's probably better to do it over time, because it does get repetitive.<br />  I kept thinking how my 7-year-old neice would enjoy the game,  but it was also fun for this 49-year-old aunt.  Great FAOTD; I'll definitely look at this company's other offerings.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|I love bollywood movies, and this one ranks on top of my list! This movie was really awe-inspiring for me. Seeing how this young muslim with a mental disability was able to become a hero was really great. I watched it with my wife and kids and we all enjoyed a great moment. What I liked was how they split the story in three parts: 1) the first hour is kinda like your typical bollywood feel-good movie, showing the birth of a love relationship; 2) the second part is a sad and almost depressing drama; 3) the third part is a heroic tale of adventure.<br /><br />Unlike pure bollywood productions, there are no group dances here. It feels more like an american movie, although there are beautiful songs throughout.<br /><br />The political message is strong, and this may be one of the few movies which dared to adress explicitly the pakistani - hindi opposition, as well as the american post 9/11 trauma.<br /><br />The DVD quality is top-nocht, with excellent DD 5.1 tracks, creating a strong atmosphere and honoring the soundtrack.<br /><br />This DVD was really worth my money; I yet have to enjoy the bonuses to find out what happended behind the scenes!

B005LAII08|4.0|Pixar has produced some of the best animated films ever made, and even the worst offerings are better than the work of most rival studios. However, after seeing trailers for Brave, I found myself wondering whether it would live up to my expectations. People running into walls or being hit in the groin are usually there to get a few cheap laughs and I expect more from a Pixar movie.<br /><br />I shouldn't have worried.<br /><br />Brave is aimed at a younger audience than Pixar's best work like Ratatouille and Up. Although it does contain deeper themes, such as conflict between mother and daughter, and dealing with society's expectations, the story is easy to follow. There were quite a few small children present in the theater when I saw the movie and I could hear them laughing and curiously asking questions about the characters. It also worked for me, and I'm by no means a small child.<br /><br />A few of the action scenes and some of the scenes set in the dark forest might worry very young children, but I don't think there's anything frightening enough to stop anyone seeing Brave.<br /><br />Those who were complaining that Pixar hasn't featured a female protagonist finally have a reason to celebrate; Merida (Macdonald) is featured heavily throughout, and she's a princess, although not in the traditional Disney style. You will hear a couple of songs, and there is a witch in the story, but Brave is not simply rehashing the formula exhausted in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Instead, Merida is like a tougher version of Rapunzel from Tangled.<br /><br />Brave is a coming-of-age tale set in ancient Scotland. The main clan-leaders all have sons, and Merida is expected to marry one of them. Unfortunately, she doesn't feel ready for marriage and wants time to discover how she feels about adult pursuits. All she really wants to do is enjoy her childhood, ride her horse, and practice her archery. This is essentially a story about a girl trying to change her fate.<br /><br />Some of the supporting characters are funny. Her potential suitors are an interesting bunch of misfits, and they supply a few laughs early in the story. Merida's three younger brothers appear regularly and are used in very inventive ways.<br /><br />Be prepared to hear Scottish accents throughout the movie. It reminded me somewhat of How to Train Your Dragon in that respect. I didn't find myself rooting for Merida as strongly as I rooted for Remy in Ratatouille because the outcome never really felt in doubt. Although Merida faces considerable peril, I never suspected that things would end badly.<br /><br />The voice acting was particularly good. Merida's father (Connolly) stole a lot of scenes and was the source of much of the humor. Kelly Macdonald did well as Merida and kept her likable, even though some of her actions were misguided. I also noticed how effective Patrick Doyle's score was. Unlike most Pixar movies, Brave is full of action, and the music enhanced those sequences considerably.<br /><br />The opening five minutes provided some of the strongest scenes in the movie as we were able to see Merida as a small girl and the relationship she had with her parents. Other magical moments included her encounter with will o' the wisps in the forest. Both of these elements reminded me of Studio Ghibli works, but Brave couldn't maintain that high standard for the whole movie.<br /><br />What we are left with is an enjoyable 90 minutes with plenty of laughs. There's less substance than that found in the best Pixar movies, but it's still a worthy addition and I will buy the Blu-ray when it is released. The overall look of the animation does match Pixar's excellent standards and it's hard to imagine it looking any better. Be prepared for a few cheap laughs, but don't miss it in theaters. I saw the 3D version and I don't think it added anything to the experience, so stick to the 2D version if you want to save a few bucks.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the full movie after being disappointed by the rather formulaic trailers. I should also mention that La Luna, the latest short from Pixar, airs immediately before Brave. That's well worth your time too.d by the full movie after being disappointed by the rather formulaic trailers. I should also mention that La Luna, the latest short from Pixar, airs immediately before Brave. That's well worth your time too.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Of all the new singers that came in the late 90s, Pink seemed to be the one to have the least amount of success. Yes she was different than the cookie cutter Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, but she also wasn't as exciting as those teen queens. But when she decided to not be different and just go with the flow, that's when she broke out as a star in her own right. Although, after the over-rated Misundaztood and the better, but still uninspiring Try This, she had yet to produce an album that was as endearing and as compelling as its singles. Then came \\"I'm Not Dead\\" in 2006, or as I like to call it, a far better take on \\"Misundaztood\\". Pink is still the angsty pop star she was in 2001, but she delivers it in a cleaner fashion that's relatable to a wider audience. And what makes \\"I'm Not Dead\\" her best album to date is her mission and purpose for creating it. Each song is about a different issue in either the media or the world. There's the issue of Hollywood girls that are famous for all the wrong reasons (Stupid Girls), the many issues of then-president George W. Bush (Dear Mr. President), runaway teens (Runaway), drug use (Who Knew), and the signature Pink songs about identity and perserverance (I Got Money Now, I'm Not Dead, and Conversations with my 13-year old self). In short, this is Pink's first album that's gripping enough to have listen all the way through and be satisfied with your listen. This is Pink at her best, and the reminder that there is no one quite as exciting in the mid 2000s as Pink.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|Have you ever: Had your heart broken? Been so pissed off at someone for leaving you when they said forever? Broken up with someone you really loved? Whether you answered yes to all of none of those questions, I'll start this review by saying that this is an excellent album. Starting from the best break-up song ever (So What) and ending with a beautiful, yet cliche, love song (Glitter in the Air), this is probably one of the most cohesive and consistent albums I've heard in a while. One factor in this is the break-up theme present in most of the songs. Pink had stated that she didn't want \\"Funhouse\\" to seem like a break-up album, but she might as well have said it was, because it works best after you've had a painful split. Pink covers all of the emotions that come with a break-up, and delivers them all exquisitely: Denial (appropriately titled I Don't Believe You), Anger (It's All Your Fault and the very compelling Funhouse), Bargaining (my favorite track, Please Don't Leave Me), and Acceptance (Crystal Ball, which was recorded in one take). But if you were looking for songs that didn't pertain to the split, Pink throws in some relief (Sober, One Foot Wrong, and Ave Mary A). Now why she decided to end this break-up album with a love song is a mystery, because it doesn't pertain to destroyed love, and it also doesn't describe accepting a break-up, so it's quite peculiar. Maybe she secretly knew that she and Carey would get back together? Whatever the case, it's still a great song to end the album. Even though it within itself is a minor letdown, it wraps up the album quite nicely. Even though this funhouse isn't quite as \\"fun\\" as Pink made it out to be, it's still very entertaining and definitely will heal your heartache.

B0020BUWX2|3.0|This was not a favorite book that I have read recently, but I really liked the sequel \\"Where She Went\\". I know most people wouldn't read the sequel of a book they were not really into, but once I am invested in a character I have to finish their story. All in all it wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I would actually rate this close to 3.5 stars but no halves so I will round up. I did enjoy this book and its interesting concept. It did take a little too long for it to get to Jacob's peculiarity and his interaction with Miss Peregrine. I loved that this story revolved around old photographs but some bits took too long for me. I don't know yet if I would want to continue this series after the sequel is published but it wasn't a waste of my reading time. Another book from a great publisher, Quirk, but I would be sure that you know what you are getting into before starting and give it time to build up and draw you in.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I have had this book on my kindle for a while now, but I read A LOT and I just now got around to it. I finished it in one night, but not because it was so intriguing, but because I was waiting for it to be as good as all of the reviews claim it to be. A friend even texted me yesterday saying that I had to read it because she was in love with it. But, honestly? I kind of hated it. I wasn't attracted or attached to the characters in the least and their relationship was so unhealthy. I would never recommend this to a teenage girl. This is exactly the opposite of the kind of relationship anyone should have. It was the classical formula for being in an abusive relationship. A boy with an explosive temper and mood swings who had the tendency to be violent and possessive. Then, whenever he did something wrong and upset her, he would become so apologetic and beg for her forgiveness, only to do it again. Let's not even get into the outrageous codependency in this relationship. I get that all relationships aren't 'pretty.' I have been with my husband for over 10 years. But, this was way past simply not being 'pretty' and would definitely be considered an unhealthy relationship.<br />A disaster? Most definitely.<br />Beautiful? Hardly.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|A very cute novel from Sophie Kinsella. It follows the same plot points that all of her novels touch on (lonely girl with crappy boyfriend/crush/job has major event happens that slowly changes her life and gets her new boyfriend but something comes up and almost ruins everything until she comes clean and lives happily ever after) but this time it was a ghost story. Great Aunt Sadie is very annoying but sweet when she wants to be. Lara was an ok main character but the main character is never the main draw of these novels for me. They are sweet bits of goodness that I can read quick and always enjoy.
B003O5MO2A|5.0|How much more classic does it get? The greatest name for a band, one of the all time, most under-rated guitarists, Buck Dharma, one of the greatest vocalists, Eric Bloom, and they're still swimming below the radar. Although, anyone trying to see this band when they come to town is lucky enough to have squeezed in. ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES is the culmination of the bands first trilogy of studio records. This is where any inquiring mind should begin their appreciation for one of the most unique heavy rock bands this world has ever known.<br /> Prior to their commercial success these live recordings display the raw animal, rough hewn, bare bones assault attack of a band unleashing itself upon the world and laying claim to being one of the greatest live acts in the annals of time. From the opening strains of \\"The Subhuman\\", one realises one has entered into the realm of other worldly transpondence and is forever entranced by those mystic vibes.<br /> And the album doesn't let up from there. \\"ME 262\\", \\"A Redcap(Before the Kiss)\\", and the incomparable \\"Seven Screaming Diz-Busters\\" all illustrate the bands fervor for dexterity with punch. Also included are the more familiar \\"Cities On Flames with Rock and Roll\\", \\"The Red and The Black\\", and \\"Harvester of Eyes\\", early staples for years to come.<br /> This album deserves the highest ranking possible. For a live recording from 1975 the sound is exquisite and the genius contained within is palpable and apparent immediately. Any person the least bit interested in BOC or music at all ought to possess this modern masterpiece. There is no possible way you can regret it. Listen and you'll know why they're considered the most important and well repected cult ever assembled.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I absolutely devoured this book. I read Eat, Pray, Love wanting to know more and this definitely gave me the extra info I wanted about what happened afterwards, plus insight about the institution and history of marriage. Which fascinated me. Gilbert frames the book around her own personal narrative in conjunction with historical information and statistics about marriage, which is a nice mix. I think anyone who is married or interested in getting married at all should give this a read. Makes you think twice about any positive/negative notions you might have had about both love and marriage in your life.
B000005RPX|5.0|Did you have a favorite album from 1972 that you wish there was more of? Did it happen to be called Made in Japan by one of the heaviest, loudest, most brash, arrogant English, virtuoso-laden bands of the day? Finally, your dreams have been realised.<br />This terrific import is the entire three night stand from Japan in the summer of '72 that the original album was culled from.<br />This collection satisfies that curiosity of what happened during those tracks on other nights. How was Ritchie's \\"Highway Star\\" solo on the first night? Now you'll be able to find out. What was the \\"Child in Time\\" like on the third night? and the \\"Space Truckin'\\", any differnet from the second to third? How do you spell Deep Purple?<br /> One of the coolest things about Deep Purple is that no two shows were ever exactly the same. The sets may have been similar. But what happened in between was always anxiously anticipated. When you have two classically trained virtuosos cranking through a Hammond B3 and a Fender Stratocaster hooked to a city of Marshall amplifiers things tend to get rowdy. Purple were and will always remain a quintessentially live band. These recordings should have already had a spot reserved in any discerning heavy rock musicians collection.<br /> This 3-CD package is the one we've been waiting for. and for the price they're offering it here you don't even need to think. If you've ever liked Purple, and there are no casual likers, you either whole-heartedly love Purple or you don't, this is the one you can't live without. Three stellar shows. This is history. Don't be a dunce. Get this while you can. The dream has become a reality for this fleeting moment. Don't hesitate. Start enjoying now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  Looking forward to reading the next one and the next one.. etc.  A must read for Sci-Fi book lovers.
B007N0REX6|3.0|Apocalyptic Love<br />Cool riff and a great middle-eight section. Chorus sounds a bit dated, but overall, a decent opener. 7/10<br /><br />One Last Thrill<br />A good energy, but the vocals sound a tad contrived and the melody doesn't exactly stand out. 3/10<br /><br />Standing in the Sun<br />I love these kind of riffs - they're so Slash. The song reminds me a little of Sweet Emotion by Aerosmith. Decent enough track, although a poor choice for a single. 6/10<br /><br />You're a Lie<br />One of the best songs on the album. A real grower. 8/10<br /><br />No More Heroes<br />Catchy bridge, great guitar work and a strong chorus. One of the better tracks for sure. 8/10<br /><br />Halo<br />Nothing special. Annoying vocals and a poor excuse of a chorus. 3/10<br /><br />We Will Roam<br />Not one of the strongest tracks, but the chorus gets stuch in your head after a few listens. 6/10<br /><br />Anastasia<br />This is the \\"epic\\" song on the album clocking in at just over 6 minutes. It kicks off with a great neo-classical inspired opening riff - I wish the song had focused more on that part. It is undoubtedly the album standout track and has a great chorus but the meandering outro solo doesn't excite me the way his best solos do. 8.5/10<br /><br />Not for Me<br />Nice track and refreshing to hear something a bit more solemn and downtempo. The opening verse reminds me of Nirvana's Something In The Way, in terms of the general mood and delivery. Kinda wish the whole song had been like that, rather than launching into another unnecessary solo which adds nothing to the track. 8/10<br /><br />Bad Rain<br />Rubbish filler. 1/10<br /><br />Hard & Fast<br />Great energy on this one. The riff sounds like a sped-up rip-off of Move To The City, but the anthemic chorus makes up for it. 7/10<br /><br />Far and Away<br />Reminiscent of Starlight from the last record but not as good. Kinda drags on towards the end and doesn't really go anywhere. 5/10<br /><br />Shots Fired<br />This is abit of a metal track, with some fast Master of Puppets-style rhythm work and a catchy guitar motif repeated throughout. 8/10<br /><br />Carolina<br />Filler. 2/10<br /><br />Crazy Life<br />I love this one. Brilliant riff, great verses and a catchy chorus. Reminds me a lot of Walk This Way by Aerosmith. 8/10<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />I'd give the album 7/10. A bit of a mixed bag and not as strong as his first solo record. However, there's a good mix of fun up-tempo rockers and soulful bluesy ballads here with plenty of cool riffs and blistering solos which is all you really expect from a Slash album.

B005LAIHYU|1.0|Who on Earth thought that such a ludicrous concept would ever fly as a serious movie? This movie might have worked as a comedy. But it takes itself absolutely seriously, so that the comedy is unintentional, and that's the worst kind of comedy.<br /><br />There's so much wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />I guess I'll start with the subtitle, \\"Vampire Hunter.\\" The titular character doesn't actually do any vampire hunting in the movie. Rather, a renegade vampire feeds Lincoln the address of a vampire, and Lincoln goes to the address and slays the vampire. Where's the \\"hunting\\" in that? Lincoln is a vampire slayer, not a vampire hunter, so the movie goes wrong right at the title.<br /><br />There's also not much of a plot. Lincoln slays vampires on the way to his presidency, and when he gets to be president, he keeps on slaying, until the head vampire's plan to take over the United States at the Battle of Gettysburg is thwarted. The movie is more like a travelogue detailing Lincoln's secret life on the way to the White House.<br /><br />The movie loses all credibility when Lincoln starts swinging his axe and slaying vampires like he's the chick from Resident Evil. The sight of a dignified American icon moving like a Ninja is beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />Then there are the actors themselves. Honestly, every single actor in this movie looks like a refugee from a comedy. Their hairstyles are comical, their facial expressions are comical...To a man, every second they're on screen, they look like they're all about to bust loose with a joke or a punch line.<br /><br />All that being said, the period set pieces were really nice. If this movie were a Western, or a genuine biography of Abraham Lincoln, it would have looked great.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all costs, unless you're looking for a good laugh.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Always enjoyed the ALIEN movies. Had all of them on dvd. But when I saw the chance to upgrade the anthology to blu-ray at such a great price, I couldn't pass it up. And they look amazing in blu-ray. Don't know how many times I've seen these movies, but I'm noticing things that didn't stand out as vividly as before. Great detail and worth every penny.

I was slighty entertained but there wasn't anything really noteworthy about the film.<br />It wasn't scary at all, but I did enjoy seeing Daniel Radcliffe in a different setting.  I thought he did a good job!<br />The atmosphere and scenery were also done well.
0345803507|5.0|I purchased both this and the third book immediately after reading the first. I had to know!! This book is definitely for mature audiences, so be sure your teen/child does not have access to it. Despite the explicit scenes, the characters are well developed so as to not veer into classic romance novel formula
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|\\"Do you want to come and play with me\\" Pretty Pretty!!! As The Great Tyrant aka The Black Queen ( Anita Pallenberg, Rolling Stones girl friend) utters those immortal words,  we realize we are in sci-fi heaven. The wait is over with this stunning first time release to blu-ray of the 1968 cult classic Barbarella starring Jane Fonda. On my big H.D flat screen T.V the film transfer and re-mastering looks simply spectacular. Gone is the dirty dull print from the previous ordinary dvd release, here is the film in all its glory, with 4 minutes extra footage of flesh and frivolity. Its certainly not the completely uncut version that buffs have been praying for, but we must be thankful for a beautiful High Definition version. The opening sequence seems to have longer shots of Miss Fonda's ample assets, those assets the naughty title sequence letters previously covered up ..... or is it just wishful thinking? The restored and re-mastered transfer here is truly glorious in detail, its brighter and clearer, and the details are crisp. Gone are all the dirt spots and scratches, the blacks are black, and the colors vivid and vibrant.  The sound is great too, you can hear the Black Queen's switch blades cut through the air like a knife, and the fantastic soundtrack by Bob Crewe (on CD if you can find it) is so memorable.<br />The sets seem more breathtaking, and the futuristic costumes by Parisian designer Jacques Fonteray and Paco Rabanne seem somehow raunchier and even more way-out. Roger Vadim the director and Jane Fonda's then husband once said \\"We want people to laugh with Barbarella, because she uses her body as a writer uses a pencil, as a means of self expression.\\" And today the humor in Barbarella seems as fresh and tongue in cheek as it did when first released, even more so. Of course Barbarella is camp and kitsch it was meant to be, but its also light hearted and fun, and a wonderful example of science fiction being spoofed. My other favorite film of this genre is DangerDiablolique also starring Barbarella's angel Pygar John Phillip Law. Barbarella has been a long time favorite of mine because I get the humor, I love the costumes and sets, and the performances by all the actors. Its a real trip too because it doesn't take itself too seriously, and its just stunning to watch on blu-ray. So thank you to the powers that be for finally re-mastering it. But please, lets see some extras and at least interviews with as many of the cast as you can. Even the still stunning Jane Fonda herself now recognizes  the film as a cult classic, and appreciates it more than ever. So do buy Barbarella on blu-ray, and sit back and enjoy it for the glorious over the top confection that it is. Robert.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I decided to read Fifty to have my own opinion of the hype surrounding this book. I was pleasantly surprised. The book was not the best I have read but it is far from the worst either. I had mixed expectations given the wide ranging ratings it has received , but I think if you take it at it's face value, that is, it is a romance book you will not be disappointed. It does't appear to be aiming  for the Booker prize it is just a story that some will find intriguing. Who doesn't want to fall in love despite the circumstances. So enjoy it for what it is, a work of fiction that I enjoyed in a single day though felt uncomfortable reading it in a public place during certain scenes.
0061743526|5.0|When Julie suggested this novel, I was apprehensively curious.  I hadn't read.  I know many people were required to read To Kill A Mockingbird in either grammar or high school.  I wasn't one of them.  I didn't know anything about it.  I thought Harper Lee was a man.  Yes, I was clueless.<br /><br />What strikes me the most about this novel is that I know every time I read it (and I will read it again), I will get something else from it.  This time I was moved by the flow of the story, by the courage it took Ms. Lee to write and publish it at one of the darkest times in US history.  I was moved by the inspiration she weaved into the pages, for her wisdom in human emotions and how truthfully she conveys them in black and white (no pun intended).  This novel is a gift to readers.<br /><br />Ms. Lee brings together a cast of character that reflects the time with stark honesty.  I loved Scout, she was full of moxie, spirit and truth.  Told from her point of view, she made me laugh out loud at times.  I loved Jem.  It was a joy and heartbreak watching him mature right before my eyes.  Atticus has such strength and peace.  He did what was right, what was fair.  He believed in justice and loved his children more than anything.  Miss Maudie was straight up ballsy.  She had class and was a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />This novel is classic, it's perfect.  It's the kind of novel that everyone must read.  I'm ashamed it took me this long to read it.  And I'm happy Julie choose this novel.<br /><br />The final thing I will take away from To Kill A Mockingbird is what Atticus says about Mrs. Dubose.<br /><br />\\"I wanted you to see what real courage is....It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.

B002QKZLZ6|3.0|You could proabably buy any square/rectangular/boxy case in place of this case.<br />There's nothing special about it that would make it unique and ideal.<br /><br />Here's some of the things that I noticed:<br /><br />* When you open the flap, you will notice that the opening is cut out so that it is almost like a backwards \\"L\\" where the long vertical part is there to protect the mike.<br />* The earpiece goes in pretty snug so there isn't really room for the earpiece to be tossed around in.<br />* The leather exterior is nice and soft and the inside makes me thing cheap felt.  It looks worn down and i can see through it even though i have only used it for about a week.<br />* I didn't like the belt clip because it was just too hard to slide anything in.  I haven't bothered with it since the initial try.<br />* I cannot charge the earpiece while it is inside the case... I wish it wasn't like that.<br />* However, It does what I intended it to do, which is to protect my earpiece while not in use... in my purse.

I have used it to &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;alter&quot; photos I post to Facebook. I have used it to &quot;block&quot; out things I didn't want to show in a photo (such as a license plate number) and to add text to a photo. It has been a fun and useful app, and I haven't even begun to scratch the surface on its many uses! I love this app!

B00514HDNW|5.0|Matheson's take on the vampire legends is a quantum jump beyond the nightmarish images conjured by writers from Bram Stoker to Anne Rice, yet presents an even more profound nightmare. A man, Robert Neville, imperfect, realistic and brave in the face of overwhelming circumstances, refuses to abandon hope even though he recognizes the very real possibility that he may be the last of his kind. Neville's desperate grasping at one last hope leads to an unexpected and provocative ending, leaving the reader with a glimpse of primal imperatives rarely sensed in literature attuned to modern, sophisticated sensitivities. It is a reminder that the word, sophisticated, is derived from the same root as sophistry.
B001GWUBSC|5.0|One of the best drama series ever. Fighting sex plotting and planding. Beheadings. It is great. Not to historical. Great actors too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Murmur, mutter, whisper, bite, smirk, gasp. That's all I remember about his book.  Halfway through the book I described it to someone as Twilight with psuedo-erotic sex and more sex. And by the way, how many women climax when \\"He\\" smirks and how many men are ready again by the time they roll over?  Weak, naive, desperate female and overbearing, jealous, stalker male. So disappointed that I actually paid for this ebook. I think the publisher and writer owe me a refund. I will not be reading the 2nd or 3rd.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game play it at least 6 times a day! the game keeps you wanting to play. its great to challage others too.... TMB holla
B00881VLCE|4.0|but often very difficult to manage the pieces. Piece rotation does work... but not without repeated attempts The pieces often \\"jump\\" away from your finger in an odd manner. Otherwise, I recommend giving the game a try. It has a decent amount of options and many of the puzzles (including the free ones) are very beautiful. One big disappointment is that I haven't yet found a way to save a game. Unless I am missing something, it appears one has to complete a puzzle in one go.

I had to read this book in small chunks so my head would not explode with all of the ideas it inspired.  I kept a notebook handy to jot ideas.  While I already had plans for several businesses, I realized that I needed rethink my business model.  I highly recommend this book and Chris's others as well.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Hornby serves up another masterful piece of nightmare fodder for those unlucky in love. Charlie is branded the titular \\"Bastard\\" by his ex in a wildly successful series of scathing articles detailing his every misstep over the course of their relationship - a terrifying prospect for anyone with a bitter ex-lover in possession of a mental stockpile of his worst moments. The concept is rife with opportunities for cringe-inducing social interactions, and - as usual - Hornby executes these scenes with a masterful grasp of the power of shame, awkwardness, and a shattered ego. But like the literary Woody Allen he can be, Hornby manages to put a reaffirming spin on all the social squirming and seems to suggest that if we can come to terms with the absolute worst about ourselves, there may light at the end of that dark post-relationship tunnel. This is a great piece of social commentary that just about anyone should be able to relate to.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|If you like the song then you will enjoy learning its history, and hearing it sung at least twice.  As a world History teacher in California, I have found it useful at the end of 7th grade, as a manifestation of the Enlightenment. Triangular trade, mercantilism, humanism, the Reformation, politics, Europe, Africa, the Americas, early slavery history and Abolition are merged with a lesson on the English Parliament. As we say in our curriculum... it has all the \\"GRAPES\\": Geography, Religion, Achievements, Politics, Economics and Social Structures.  And a love story for some minor skin and bling that seem to be necessary these days to zap 12 and 13 year olds. Give it some time when first watching and don't be afraid to stop, discuss and answer questions. I have a lesson plan for this. A fine work.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|I considered four stars because I \\"liked\\" this story. While I think the story was a good story, it's not a great \\"science fiction\\" story -- and I do not believe that John Scalzi meant for it to be that. It's ultimately commentary that touches on the nature of creativity, the consequences of bad writing, and a reverent exploration on treating artifacts of the imagination with respect. If the last part of that sounds intentionally obtuse, it's because I'm not trying to give anything away. I would make this required reading for any aspiring author of fiction. It's an emotional suckerpunch. You go in expecting one thing (satyr, which you get), but there is just so much more substance beyond that. It's a quick read, but it can be as light as you want it to be or as heavy as you want, depending on how much you want to think about it all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games book one details a tragic story of  what can happen when the country becomes a rich vs poor situation, those who have access to higher education vs those who are denied the chance.  It is a story of how a country of citizens can be manipulated into believing the reality the government wants them to believe.  It shows what can happen if we allow our leaders to run free with no checks and balances to protect the people.  The secondary plots that run through this book follow unrequited love, the desire to outwit the leaders and the hardships and lives of the inhabitants.  A wondrfuffy rich and thought provoking book.  A must read for everyone. It would make a great book discussion as well as an educational tool to let students determine how the constitution is violated in this book and what or how it happened and a great debate subject.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down! This book was fantastic. It pulls you in at the very beginning and leaves no loose strings at the end. The characters were so well written and developed. I found myself wanting a Travis Maddox!

B005LAII0I|5.0|I'm watching it now.  Very entertaining.  I am especially enjoying Nathan Lane in this movie.  He has some wonderful lines, and being the veteran that he is, he delivers them beautifully.  Always like Julia Roberts.  Just added this to my wish list.  This is a great, winter, fireplace and popcorn movie!!!  Think I'll have a marathon.  Mirror, Mirror and Enchanted!!! followed by Beauty and the Beast.  I'm an unashamed big kid!!!  Just finished watching it.  Truly loved it.  And just when I thought it couldn't get better, it had a Bollywood ending!!!  Too funny!!!

B005IQZB14|5.0|At 26 years old, Cheryl Strayed steps out of addiction and despair into a true test of survival: Walking 1100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail all alone. Though unprepared physically and emotionally, Strayed faces her fears and finds mostly kindness in herself and the eclectic assortment of folks she encounters on her journey. Along the way she releases the angst of her mother's death and her own failed marriage, experiencing a rebirth that is rare in our generation. Strayed's \\"Wild\\" is a yin to Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" yang adventure on the Appalachian Trail.  Her compelling prose and sincerity convert her PCT quest into an accomplished piece of literary nonfiction. Watching the book trailer at CherylStrayed.com after reading the book was an added treat!

All I know was that a week before I purchased the book, in my prayers I had asked God to help me deal with this....certainly He did. This book makes me feel [ Good Of Who I Am ] My heart now sings songs, songs that at once were forbidden to sing. It jumps, it screams, it loves. My heart now runs across mountains, knowing that at the end, it will be in peace, and nothing of this will matter. I Love this Book, it has become a part of Me. A Me that is not afraid to Love. A Me that is willing to take a Risk. Finally its Me.<br /><br />With much gratitude,<br />Richard, an 18 year old who is still struggling, but is now finally himself.<br /><br />Greates Book Ever.

0345803485|2.0|I am almost finished with the second book.  I amaze myself that I am still reading this, but I guess it's like when you keep watching a really horrible movie and can't turn it off.  It's so poorly written it's almost funny, the erotic parts are boring and the characters.... They smirk, lips in a hard line, roll their eyes even more then the characters in Twilight and who says laters?  I can't even begin to define what's wrong with Grey and Ana, in a way she has more wrong with her then he does.  For a University graduate she acts like she just hatched out of an egg.

I am able to type in the notes or info I want and then separate it into.various notebooks for organization.

B002VWNID6|3.0|I found an old VHS tape in a donation box on a sidewalk and found the Robin Hood Prince of Thieves within.  Perhaps I should have left it there!<br /><br />Panned at the time of its 1991 release, American-sounding Kevin Costner's emotional range is not all that great.  He escapes from a Moslem prison, a participant in the Crusades, run by King Richard (whom we don't see until the end, quick cameo by Sean Connery).  This aspect was pretty good - friend dies in sacrifice, great photography and intensity of story.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman stands out as the Moslem who has a life debt with Robin and so he comes to England with his \\"Christian\\" friend.<br /><br />The story of Robin Hood is quite compelling, gives to the poor by robbing the rich, but Costner seems to be phoning in his lines and has none of the swashbuckling, adventuresome self-confidence of Errol Flynn's 1938 \\"Adventures of Robin Hood.\\"<br /><br />Alan Rickman chews the scenery with his campy over-acting.  Hard to believe this was the same actor who played it straight in \\"Die Hard\\" or evoked evil imagery in the Harry Potter films.  The occasional 20th century phraseology (\\"bring a friend\\") was pretty bad.<br /><br />Alan could have played it better as John.  His relationship with the old crone was unclear.  His thirst for women and relentless killing was a bit much - no one would oppose this type of tyranny?  Hard to swallow.<br /><br />Despite these problems, some scenes stand out - the invasion of the Celt-like band as they invade the forest and burn out Robin (these crazed warriors had really bad make-up!) and the rescue of Little John's family did elicit interest and was played seriously.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  The serious parts play well.  The attempts at comedy, not so much.  Rickman's campy acting ruined it for me, as well as Costner's lack of real emotion.  Decent photography and scenery as well as its famous theme-song (Bryan Adams', Everything I Do, I Do For You, was quite well-done. ) helped it along - worth a watch but not more than once!t along - worth a watch but not more than once!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing the recommendations for this book, both my husband and I decided to read this book.  It started out a little slow and was a little hard to figure out but by Book 2 I was totally into it!  By the time I got to Book 5, I was so engrossed in the story that I couldn't put the book down.  I HAD to find out how things would end!  The book ends with openings for more books and I really do hope there are more.  I would love to find out what else is happening in Hugh Howey's world.  Please keep them coming Hugh!<br />Very well written, I would recommend this book to mature teens and adult readers who enjoy a good sci-fi, end of the world book.

B00782O7NE|4.0|I'll be honest, I went into The Artist a bit skeptical. From reviews I had previously read, and all of the film's press and marketing, I was expecting a pretty straightforward homage to classic silent film without really bringing anything new or inventive to the genre.<br /><br />Sadly, upon finishing the film, I found my initial suspicions to be quite wholly confirmed. But I won't go into that yet. Let's first be positive.<br /><br />Make no mistake, The Artist IS a good movie. A very solid 3/4, 4/5, 7/10, however you'd like to rate it, and I would never advise anyone NOT to see it, it's worth at least one viewing, and can be entertaining enough to own.<br /><br />The best part of the film is, quite obviously, its concept; it is very much a perfect representation of silent filmmaking, from its 1.33:1 aspect ratio, to its spectacular cinematography, to its actors' signature physical overacting that has always been a hallmark of silent films...it's the complete package in that respect.<br /><br />However, as much I love visuals, they aren't everything, of course; story matters, and it's the story that I found severely lacking with The Artist. The general premise of the film is a very familiar one; an aging silent film star struggles against the incoming onslaught of the new medium of \\"talking pictures\\".<br /><br />The first thing I immediately noticed was just how similar this concept was to Singin' in the Rain in many respects, even Jean Dujardin brings in shades of Gene Kelly in his performance, and the overall subtext over the death of silent pictures is near identical to the ground Singin' in the Rain had already covered some 50 years ago.<br /><br />The second flaw is, well, this overall concept really isn't enough to make a thoroughly compelling and engaging story. Singin' in the Rain had music and dancing and several other brilliant examples of '50s filmmaking to augment and improve the story. Without those integrals, The Artist ends up seeming overly simplistic and without a great amount of emotion engagement or value - and, outside of its main character - all of the supporting cast end up being portrayed more as charactures than living, breathing individuals.<br /><br />But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the production is how badly it squandered the incredible potential that the concept inherently possesses. The writer/director seemed to almost entirely overlook most intriguing and valuable aspect of the story; the comparative differences between silent movies and \\"talkies\\".<br /><br />For those with a great knowledge of classic and silent film, the advent of audio brought with it several distinct disadvantages that - now 80 years later - we've nearly entirely forgotten about. When you remove sound, and dialogue from a movie, as a director, you're forced to rely on and convey your story and moral points largely through visual metaphors and the physical, facial acting of your cast. As the ability to convey our stories through dialogue has become the norm, directors and actors alike have largely abandoned the purely visual storytelling of the silent film era.<br /><br />What I personally would've liked to see The Artist deal with, is that contrast between those two styles of filmmaking; highlight the various advantages and disadvantages to both, showcase what makes silent films so unique, and weave in some subtext about what we've really lost creatively due to the invention of sound in films.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, the director very rarely touches on any of these themes, and ultimately seems more interested in telling the entirely basic tale of the main actor's descent into depression than anything more meaningful or expansive about the genre itself. Which is surprising, considering French directors are usually known for their complexity and large philosophical scope.<br /><br />Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was more concerned own wishes for the film than what it actually was. Whatever the reason, I completed my viewing of The Artist entertained, but never quite satisfied.

B004SKIPXW|2.0|If you enjoy 3D views of extreme gunshot damage, you may be in luck.  Throw in a liking for some general low class behavior scenes by the leading woman, and general violence from start to finish and this movie might be for you.  If you think it is a high speed driving movie in 3d.... it's not.  It's closer to a combination of some of the recent vampire fare coupled with an End of Days tweak.  I didn't expect much, but bought it because it was 3d.  I still was disappointed.  Cage probably did what he could with the part, but it was an uphill battle that he couldn't win. Oh, well, it was selling at a discounted price.

B00005JK8K|2.0|It could have been such a great movie. The story of code talkers AND of the terrible and tragic battle of Saipan in one movie - and they had Nicholas Cage, who, contrary to all his haters, is a good actor (remember a little movie called \\"Moonstruck\\"?). But the way this film was made... oh, brother... I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />First, the director messed up a potentially passionate story by showing the recruitement, training and arrival of the Indian code talker to the front in possibly the dullest, colourless way possible. Expect a looooong introduction.<br /><br />Then, Nicholas Cage character was made in a depressed, half suicidal idiot. Good grief, he plays a man with a mission here, an intelligence officer, charged to protect an invaluable asset (the Indian code talker) - there is no way that in time of war somebody so depressed and dejected could be assigned such a mission. Except in direst of circumstances - and to invade Saipan US Marines and US Army had lots of ressources, including good officers.<br /><br />The fighting scenes on Saipan - they are exactly like in the worst Chuck Norris movies from the 80s. A short message to moviemakers in Hollywood: \\"Hello, guys, Spielberg with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and Ridley Scott with \\"Blackhawk Down\\" already revisited war movies - and the kind of cheap stuff we were OK with before, we, the viewers, we do not buy it anymore\\". I fully agree with some of the previous reviewers - in this film Japanese soldiers act like total morons, and they get killed by bushels from a single burst of machine gun. This is ridiculous. The fighting scenes on Solomon Islands in the opening scenes (featuring Nicholas Cage) are EVEN worse!<br /><br />The ending was supposed to be sad and touching - but at that moment I was so tired of \\"Windtalkers\\" that I was just relieved that it is over.<br /><br />I give this movie two stars just because I simply like Nicholas Cage, no matter how bad is the movie he is in. Also Adam Beach, the Canadian actor who comes from the Ojibwa nation, gives a great performance and he saves some scenes from the total disaster. But it is still a disaster. Do not waste your money and one evening.an actor who comes from the Ojibwa nation, gives a great performance and he saves some scenes from the total disaster. But it is still a disaster.

B00138KGOS|4.0|At the end of June 2012 I was driving through Westchester Cnty listening to the incomparable inestimable WFUV. A Gordon Lightfoot set was up. I dropped in midway onto Early Morning Rain from Peter Paul & Mary. I'm old enough to have seen them live when Puff was still a hit, to have bought all of Bob Dylan's records as they were first released, still alive enough to be psyched by Sleigh Bells (for just one antithetical but similarly new guard for its time example). And enough of a Dylan fan to have a couple hundred bootlegged Dylan concerts on the shelves. So I could easily identify the bands covering Lightfoot. Until the second cover of Early Morning Rain. After 40 years, it had detached itself from any expectations I held of Dylan or any other 70s artist. A clear, fully SUNG, honestly interpreted cover of a very good song. Well before I could identify the singer (and it's hard - he wasn't smoking or touring and he could SING those few years in the early 70s), I was struck by how good it was. I didn't hate the album when it came out, but obviously I didn't get why it was as vital as so many others. I pulled it out when I got home and now I do.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Both me and my 6 years old daughter we loved this movie - although of course for different reasons.<br /><br />She appreciated the very idea of talking cars and then the races, Mator the \\"red-neck\\" car, etc. I was impressed by the animation - this is for the moment the most technically advanced animation movie I ever saw (\\"Happy Feet\\" did as well) - and the more adult oriented humouristic parts (a Porsche girl who left Los Angeles to find peace in a small town; an old town doctor, called Doctor in Internal Combustion; the cars going to the toilet - guess which line is advancing faster..., a rivalry between a \\"Peace and Love\\" old van and a retired sergeant who is of course a jeep, a Japanese female journalist who is a gorgeous little Honda, etc, etc.).<br /><br />The final scenes in which they show fragments of older Pixar movies (like Sully and Mike Wazowski stranded in Himalayas) played by cars (the Yeti being an enormous snow tractor) are a delight. I just can not uderstand some of very critical (and mean) reviews below - I loved this movie and, more important, my daughter loved it too. She insisted on sleeping on a pillow with Ligthning McQueen for months after that...<br /><br />If you didn't see it - go and get it.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Watching movies is kind of like dining--there are times you want a superb five star meal and there are other times you crave McDonald's (or insert your favorite fast food restaurant here). \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" is mindless, cheesy fun and, if accepted for that, you'll enjoy it. It's the perfect McDonald's meal for the mind. As far as the visual effects and set pieces in the film \\"Wrath\\" beats its predecessor although the cheesy fun factor is a bit less in evidence here as the film has a more serious vibe. In a way that works for \\"Wrath\\" giving the film its own identity.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />It's been 10 years since Perseus (Sam Worthington)last saw his father Zeus (Liam Neeson)after killing the Kraken. He married Io (Gemma Arterton in the first film), they had a son, Io died and he has returned to the simple life of fishing. Zeus returns to ask for Perses' help; the Titans are escaping and Zeus needs the help of his son to fight them. Later, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) captures Zeus and sacrifices his brother's power to release their father Kronos the most powerful of the Titans.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks spectacular--with a state-of-the-art, colorful and sharp transfer. The transfer highlights the fine CGI work and, really, this is a film about the visual effects not the acting, directing or writing.<br /><br />Audio is also spectacular with a very active lossless presentation.<br /><br />Director Jonathan Liebesman does a credible job of setting up the action and making the film look good. I'm not sure how the screenwriters got their jobs (Dan Mazeau didn't have any credits that I could find prior to this movie while David Johnson wrote a couple of episodes of \\"The Walking Dead\\", the horrible \\"Red Riding Hood\\" and \\"Orphan\\")for this particularly movie but they do construct a servicable script although the dialog can often be pretty over ripe and stinky at times(\\"Look at me now: in the bowels of Tartarus, saving the universe. Just follow the Navigator.\\")<br /><br />If \\"Wrath\\" is the Happy Meal of cinema, then Sam Worthington is one of many toys that gives us plenty of distraction. Worthington demonstrates more confidence this time around (and has more hair as well). The rest of the cast vary from attractive visual distractions to amusing performances.<br /><br />Luckily, most of the performances are pretty good especially Bill Nighy as Hephaestus, Rosamund Pike (replacing Alexa Davalos)as Queen Andromeda and Toby Kebbell as Agenor. As usual Neeson and Fiennes both do their best with the material their given. The best performance is given by Edgar Ramierez as Ares who provides a sympathetic portrayal as a villian. He shows up the veterans and the star in a nicely tuned performance that's more complex than what's truly in the script.<br /><br />The special features include a dual \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" where you can choose \\"The Path of the Gods\\" or \\"The Path of Men\\"--each is a unique glimpse behind-the-scenes into Greek mythology (in the case of the former)and behind-the-scenes footage (in the case of the latter). \\"Focus Points\\" allows you to see the behind-the-scenes footage if you would prefer not to watch the movie again in \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" to see the extras.<br /><br />We also get unfinished deleted scenes and, quite honestly, the film doesn't suffer for having them cut out.<br /><br />Nobody will mistake \\"Wrath\\" as intellectual nor a great movie but it sure is fun.follow the Navigator.\\")<br /><br />If \\"Wrath\\" is the Happy Meal of cinema, then Sam Worthington is one of many toys that gives us plenty of distraction.

B001RTCP1A|4.0|I was very favourably surprised by this movie, which didn't make a big score when opening in cinemas but now is much more recognised once it is accessible on DVD.<br /><br />It is one of the most original SF films of those last years, well filmed and with good actors. And it was really not easy to do something original considering the topic - a spaceship crashes on a distant and hostile planet and the stranded crew struggles to survive and find a way out. It was already treated in many SF books - and still this movie managed to find an original way to deal with the story.<br /><br />I do not want to give spoilers, but from the title of the movie you can safely presume that absence of light will play an important role - and you will be right! Special effects, light and sound were very well done in this movie and even the most spoiled viewers should find this movie visually and accoustically quite impressive. There is at least one scene which WILL definitely impress you - when a giant planet rises above the horizon line of the alien world, where the action is situated. I still shiver with delight when I remember this moment.<br /><br />Also, if by any chance you saw the idiotic sequel of this movie (\\"Chronicles of Riddick\\") please stay calm - \\"Pitch Black\\" is totally different in every aspect. It has a credible plot, interesting characters and simply is a real treat for every SF fan. OK, it is not \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Aliens\\", but is still a really good movie. See it and have fun!

0440243688|3.0|Another good Reacher novel. Though not amongst the best of the Reacher series 'Gone Tomorrow' was a good read. The plot was adequate and the execution of it wasn't bad at all.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This true story of courage and sacrifice of Adam Brown and his family is just amazing. Adam's story of his fight with drug addiction and then turning a new leaf over by committing himself to Christ was so well written that I had a hard time putting this book down. I will definitely be reading more books by Eric Bleham!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great reading for the ladies.  Storyline & characters keep you wanting more!  But I wish the author would expand her vocabulary. . .
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These stickers were very easy to apply and the color was magnificent.They were shipped quickly and safely so as not to tear them off the backing or rip the sticker. I will definitely be buying more.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I read the reviews but for some reason Discovery of Witches kept showing up on my radar, first as an Audible book I downloaded by accident that when I began listening to caught my interest; to a few other books out there that were on my Wish List. Even though it was already on my iPhone, I downloaded the Kindle version and began the journey.  For me, a good book can be an incredible journey.  Sorry if some of you did not enjoy the book but I for one love history and ancient knowledge.  Additionally, having lived in England for over 12 years on and off the visuals of the areas and people she described rang true.  For one reader who did not understand why Diana did not know her powers, you clearly missed the section on the binding that her parents did to protect her and hide her talents; she simply did not know.  Really, this is a fiction novel and should be treated as such, not some real world experience.  A good book is about losing yourself in it and discovering something new and I found it well researched (several of the characters existed in history and the places are true to form) and thus entertaining on many levels.  When I can see the house, the people, the events in my minds eyes, it's a book I will read to the end.  Deborah Harkness did a good job with detail and with information.  Well Done
B007L3BMGA|1.0|even with severe suspension of disbelief this novel is beyond the realms of reality with poor characterization, unlikely psychological and circumstantial matter and is boring,predictable, pornographic nonsense. what a waste.
1466401885|5.0|I'm not sure there is really much left to say since over a thousand people have already commented.  So I thought I'd just say that I too think this is a fantastic book.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Ok, so I read the first book in less than 24 hours... The second book took a little longer but faster than I read most books... But by the time I got a few chapters into this book, I was just over it... The writing is getting annoying... The repetitiveness of everything is too much. Chapter 5 is as far as I got and I don't really want to finish the book.
0763655465|5.0|Our 2 year old loves this book. She loves all things dogs and is starting to get cause/effect and behavior so she definitely enjoyed \\"naughty George\\" and predicting what would happen on each page. It's illustrated well and she is drawn instantly to the wide eyed cat. It's in our bedtime rotation with all of the Mo Willems, Bob Shea, and other books she finds so clever.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|Dominique Moceanu is the reason I fell in love with gymnastics. I was 10 during the 96 Olympics, and I signed up for gymnastics the very next day. With that being said, I bought this book the day it came out and could not put it down! It was VERY interesting to read about what really went on during her time with the Karolyi's and with her family drama. Definitely a must read!!<br /><br />PS. Did anyone else cringe seeing Marta Karolyi on tv during the Trials? I just cannot look at her or Bela the same ever again.....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Best game ever... so much fun! You will become obsessed, trying to finish each quest/challenge!<br /> Literally one of the best games I've ever played.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would like to preface my review of this novel by mentioning that I am neither a mystery/crime/thriller buff nor have I read any of Flynn's past works. I am just an avid reader who saw the stellar reviews of this book and was inspired to try it. I'm happy to report that this book lives up to its hype!<br /><br />I enjoyed this book primarily because it was something of a hybrid of character study and mystery novel. Flynn was able to create (and maintain) an aura of suspense and intrigue without merely stringing together a series of frenetic, increasingly unbelievable plot twists. (There were plot twists, certainly, but they were somehow both unexpected and realistic). The suspense was founded, instead, on her immensely detailed characterizations. Amy and Nick had such distinct voices in their alternating vignettes that I didn't want to put the book down because I wanted to learn more about their actions, thoughts, and motivations.<br /><br />GONE GIRL is a compelling and well-written book that I really enjoyed, so I hope you will check it out. I'm already planning to read Flynn's other works!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />Very goog product quality, especially for the price I paid. The case is very beautiful and will stay in this state for a while...<br /><br />Thanks!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really do like this cause when somebody asks me some kind of math problem I just grab my kindle and go to this app it makes other people think I'm smart even though it makes me feel a little dumb...haha...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Addicting game and hard to unlock which makes it fun and over 100 games which makes it cool and fun.
B007W8RE7K|4.0|The issue I have is with the Limited Edition stand alone mask that ships with the Box Set. It is built with very poor craftmanship. It appears that the mask is made of a very soft wood that does not work well with the screws used to attach the mask to the stand. The overall item is very poor. I'm surprised that Fear Factory would endorse this kind of poor work. On a brighter note, I love the new album. The music is amazing.
1439148813|5.0|This book is an extremely good read! Gene Kranz is definitely \\"Mr. Cool\\" from Mission Control and in his book gives an interesting and entertaining summary of his life and work from the early days right up to his famous part in Apollo 13 and beyond. It is fascinating to learn how Mission Control got started and what obstacles the teams had to master - the \\"clean and lean\\" Mission Control as we know it from the Apollo era is the result of these hard and uncertain early days.<br />The book is fascinating from start to finish and I do differ in some here stated opinions - I find the book very well written and I like the way Gene Kranz narrates (I've seen numerous interviews with him and he definitely has a biting wit). He knows exactely what he's talking about and he does this extremely well! For anyone interested in the NASA Space program, the life of Gene Kranz and all that has to do with it, this book is a must. Highly recommendable!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app everyday it is uplifting and inspiritinol. I can go to this Bible app and look up anything I want to know in the Bible.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great game everyone can play this awesome game. I love and so do my bros every since. I got it on my kindle fire
B00005RHF8|1.0|Do not buy this version of Jane Eyre. The dvd is awful. Sound is horrible, picture even worse, big pieces of some of the scenes are missing. This was such a good production when it aired, why cannot a company \\"remaster\\" it to dvd properly? Not worth wasting your money to buy this version.<br /><br />MEH
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like virtual city playground because it's just my type of game. I like games where I get to build from scratch. Awesome game!
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a great app but it sometimes has some really annoying glitches. At least on my kindle fire. So I guess its worth it still.
