B005XQLBU4|4.0|I just got this today and the only reason was because of the volume of 4+ ratings. This game is fun if you like repetitive levels. Because of that I only give it 3 stars but I did add a star because of the reaction needed to prevent total destruction.

0199575282|4.0|I am writing a novel and found the book very helpful. It was specific in instruction as well as in illustrations. I recommend it to my writing friends.
0307887898|5.0|This book goes over how a startup or development group in a larger org can do experiments to see what customer's perceive as adding value.  I love the philosophical start about how in the past people knew we needed to produce more, but the modern industrialized world has more than enough products and services, so the trick is to work out what people want.<br /><br />It goes into logical fallacies and misleading thought processes that cloud an entrepreneur's judgement.<br /><br />My only complaint is that in almost every example case, the product or service is a game.  What if your product is medical product, scientific instrumentation, or a module used in industrial automation?  That's not covered.  When reading stories about figuring out which chat programs kids will find cool, it's hard to make the leap and apply it to working out which features a laboratory would pay for on a spectrometer.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I had a hard time getting started in this book just simply bc of the verbiage and different language. Once I got past that I couldn't put it down! This book has some unpredictable twists that will make you angry, break your heart and elate your sole. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B008Y78M60|5.0|Wow. After Lincoln is assassinated two world views collide in this real life story. The ruling official/War Secretary Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) will do anything to control the nation at all costs even if individual constitutional rights are destroyed, on the basis there is no point in having a constitution if the nation is lost.  The returning war hero/attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) will do anything to protect the constitution even if government control is stalled, on the basis there is no point of having a nation if the protected rights of its citizens are lost. His closing argument ended something like \\"if his mother can be convicted on such insufficient evidence, then I tell you none of you are safe!\\"<br /><br />This movie seems well-directed, the acting is great, and the story is compelling. Unfortunately as a courtroom drama it's sorta predictable ...the audience is pretty much locked into one (historical) ending. But hey that didn't keep us from watching Titanic (like 3 or 4 times). Anyway the movie tries to be accurate to historical detail and costume, coupled with citizens detained and tried in a military court. It really is like being there. It takes the audience beyond the cliché idea of Blue and Gray, and puts the Civil War in an altogether different perspective. Anyway I liked The Conspirator, I give it five stars, and I'll be recommending it to others.<br /><br />By the way, if concepts like liberty, freedom, war, human rights, life and death screw with your head, no worries, \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" is out now. Ya. It has Abraham Lincoln, history ...and stuff. (argh)
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Amy and Nick are married for five years, but there is not much harmony left. All of a sudden, Amy is missing. And from there, a more and more surprising and devious plot develops, cleverly and elegantly put together by a very talented writer.<br /><br />It is difficult to talk about the plot without risking spoilers. So let's say this: It is not a conventional thriller. There are twists and totally surprising developments, we are getting manipulated and are lied to by both protagonists. It's not only a thriller, the book is also about unconventional truths about love and marriage. Sadly, the ending is a disappointment. Best not to expect too much from it and just enjoy the reading of the novel as such.<br /><br />The book is always straightforward and readable, but maybe there are a few digressions too many. I can't help but feeling that nowadays thriller writers feel the need to expand their books to 600 pages when 400 would have done just as well. That's stupid, because it automatically weakens the suspense.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn really deconstructed love and marriage here a lot, so I have a suggestion for readers who would like to read a (shorter) crime novel which is thrilling, full of dark humor and lets you believe in love again: [[ASIN:B00B4XLRX6 Heads Off (A Lisa Becker Mystery)]].
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very good book, i had been told about it by many people so I finally bought it. Found out by chapter 2 that I had read it a long time ago. Should have checked on the copyright date and would have realized it but oh we'll, it was still very good.

B0000067L2|5.0|Three powerful personalities guided by Producer Felix Pappalardi and making historically important and great music.  You know, Cream's career was so short that owning their greatest hits album is really not enough.  This is one of Eric Clapton's shinning moments.  Eric was his best when he was just the guitarist.  Why do you think he changed the name of Eric and the Dominos to Derek and the Dominos while he was standing at the microphone at a live show?  He knew.  Eric's solo efforts as a band leader,  as great as he was, were never as good as his appearences as just the guitarist.  Cream, Derek, Blind Faith,  and his first solo album, \\"Eric Clapton\\" were more collaborative efforts where his profile was equal to his bandmates, AND coincidently, they are also his greatest acheivements.  Well, this is his first great place of accomplishment,  so Fresh Cream, Disraeli, Wheels of Fiyah, are all great.  Eric's first great band.  Jack's innovative song writing.  Ginger's experience-laden drumming.  Its still great.  Johnny P

B005LAIIN0|1.0|I knew when Brad Pitt bought the rights to the book he would ruin it. World War Z is a bloodless, mindless, not remotely scary bore.<br /> Without getting into spoilers there are moments that should be scary or suspenseful, but are actually very very funny.<br /> Marc Foster should never have been allowed to direct a movie after Quantum of Snoring, and Pitt is as wooden as ever.

B009NG1Q96|4.0|So I finished this in two days, which hasn't happened in awhile. All of the elements that made The Selection enjoyable were there, the story deepened, and so did the annoyances. I did not like America in this book. I found her generally unoffensive in The Selection as a girl who had lost her first love and her plans for the future and who threw herself into a new possibility to distract herself. In The Selection, although naive and somewhat easily influenced, she had a steady presence and personality. In The Elite, her personality is consistent but in the most annoying way. She cannot make up her mind and she slips 180 over and over (and over and over and over) again. A couple flip flops between Aspen and Maxon and her respective futures with them would suffice, but this had to be like 10 and felt like 100. And it had the effect of making her seem selfish, uncaring, and immature.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />Also, did anyone else find it hard to believe she kept meeting with Aspen after what happened to Marlee??? No freaking way!<br /><br />*End Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />So again, if I'm annoyed and making faces at the book as I'm reading, why the four stars? Because once again, although not in any way a good book, it's such an enjoyable read. It was still light, fun, and entertaining, while adding elements to the story that develop what it means to be a real princess and not just the fairy tale version. And I'm sure I will totally consume the next book and thoroughly enjoy that too. Guilty pleasure, y'all.

The best thing is I can use my smartphone to watch tv by other means like you tube. I stream the nightly news so I still can watch local events. The only downfall is that chromecast only works with you tube,netflix and google play tv from your smartphone. You can cast anything from the computer,. Hopefully chromecast will allow other apps to use it. Well worth the money! Ordered a second one but have to wait till october to ship.....

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Luttrell's story is one of true friendship, survival, loss and healing, and also support and true dedication to the U.S.A.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The first thing I had to ask, from when I first got news of the tsunami, is only complete idiots and people too spoiled for life would travel from the U.S. or Europe to spend Christmas in a southeast Asian coastal tourist attraction.  Christmas is a holy time, with church, and home, and family, and even amid the celebrating and presents Christmas isn't Christmas without the sense of the sacred and the ties to home.<br /><br />This couple seem typical; plagued by financial worries they still take a plane to stay in a swank hotel, and the fact that they appear to be temporarily stranded in Japan for the father's work to begin with doesn't excuse it.<br /><br />The couple behave like complete idiots from minute 1.  It starts when it doesn't occur to either mother or son to stay in a tree once one catches ahold of one.  The father sends his five and six year old off to some unknown destination alone with people he doesn't even know; it's a wonder they weren't sold into prostitution or slavery like tens of thousands of children caught in that disaster.  He stays behind to look for his wife and eldest son who from what he knows are probably dead and certainly not both nearby and able to answer his shouts.<br /><br />The movie often drags.  It takes twenty minutes to even get going.  The end drags as well.  Parts of the middle drag.<br /><br />The ending is improbable.  I know for a fact that people characteristically looked for days or weeks for loved ones.  This family happen to come together and find each other by a pure series of accidents.  I don't think so!<br /><br />Finally, we are never told how the financially strapped upper middle class family manage to have a private plane fly them to civilization - and only the villagers who rescue the mother and the eldest son ever manage to think of putting clothing on them.  They are still barefoot when they get on the plane. Some of them are still covered with blood, despite days of wandering.  I mean, I'd have washed off, if I had to do it in a tidal pool.<br /><br />With all that said the movie does manage to hold your attention - much of the time.if I had to do it in a tidal pool.<br /><br />With all that said the movie does manage to hold your attention - much of the time.

1451683405|1.0|Harris adds absolutely nothing new to the free will debate, and if anything, just makes it very confusing...<br /><br />He flip-flops so much that he doesn't make sense. Sometimes he will sound like a fatalist, then he will bounce from hard determinist, to sounding like a compatabilist.<br /><br />If you're interested in the free will debate, look elsewhere. Harris is extremely inarticulate on the issue. The only people who gave this book a good review must be sycophants of Harris.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|My rating may or may not be informative to other users. I love it for a very specific reason. It does a great job of working with Microsoft Excel on my Kindle Fire Generation 1. As far as I've been able to determine so far, it will not work similarly on the Kindle Fire Generation 2 because the Gen 2 will not permit the Excel file to be transferred to it. Kingsoft Office doesn't seem to work very well with Microsoft Word. That doesn't matter to me. My Kindle Fire Generation 1 does a great job of that, although it doesn't permit editing.

It makes one think about life and relationships and how one action (or lack of action) can change one's whole life.  I loved the style of writing.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It rocks but I really want the game designers to change that when you fall of your bike it should follow the man not the bike sometimes the man does cool flops and the bike isn't interesting at all when he falls out.
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|Just a simple way to kill time on breaks when I need to get away from my desk. That's it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I received my Kindle as a Christmas gift a few years ago from my parents and it is the best gift I ever got!  I use it everyday.  I like to read on my lunch break and since my kindle is in a stand alone case I can read hands free, I love it!!  Amazon makes it so easy to download new books, it couldn't be any easier...Great Job!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Each level makes me think.  Good to keep the mind active and alert.  Great to take your mind off mundane matters.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is almost perfect, it needs more. After a bit more than a week, there's NOTHING to do on this game. Please developers, add more to this game. It needs at least more cars, online multiplayer, more zones (like an underwater glass tunnel), or maybe even a new obstacle or hidden area. This is a lot to ask for but for those that, agree, make this game better.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|I have to admit, as a huge Cinderella fan, the first time I heard this, I was perplexed by its style.  But PLEASE, give it a second or third listen, like I did.  This album is phenomenal, speaks from places that all our 40-somethings are coming from now, and conjures up enough classic styles to makes me remember, smile, and rock out.  Something that is sorely missing these days.  Tom is great musician, singer, and song writer.  I've been waiting for Night Songs II since 1986.  This isn't it.  This is a more grown-up version of Long Cold Winter, and I love it.  The fact that Still Climbing went unnoticed because of when it came out makes me furious.  I would love to see Tom do another Cinderella album soon, or another solo album that doesn't take 10 years to produce.  Tom, we are HUGE fans and wish you the best.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Time to get your game on and check out subway surfer.  Much better than temple run and the landscape is much easier to maneuver.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I was looking for inexpensive, small headphones for traveling and opted for the MDR 7506. They sound much better than I expected. For better sounding phones one needs to pay four or five times what I payed. I am very happy with my purchase.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Really enjoyed the performances particularly Jude Law.  He really comes across as arrogant early, and then defiant as the story unfolds.  The script is tight, and is unpredictable with several twists and turns.<br /><br />Tight direction under Steven Soderbergh, who has stated this was to be his last film.  His earlier efforts include Traffic, Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich and Ocean's 11.<br /><br />Solid performances from Channing Tatum, Catherine Zea Jones and a very compelling effort from Rooney Mara.
1451695195|5.0|Dr Collin's book has touched a chord that was like de ja vu and opening another spiritual dimension for me. The book was wonderfully written and a page turner...there were times that I felt I was there, then I would even come back. However the ability to write about such an experience in such a clear and conscise manner is laudable. A few months back I read Sanjay's book \\" God is Real\\" a book that awakened my search into myself, but after reading Dr Collin's work Sanjay's ideas and concepts had a new meaning, and finally the 'penny dropped' I got it! things started to come together and in a very profound way...spiritual genius!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|BINGO!  The makers of BINGO Blitz.  Game operation was a bit confusing and play action was boring.  I hate to say it but I would probably not recommend it and I am sorry I spent some of my Amazon gift card in the app.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Has a great feel of nostalgia with a new twist, also makes it very hard to put down. If it weren't for this app I may never have realized this take on a classic even existed.
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|I saw this mentioned, someplace, as a \\"comedy.\\" No!! This is a brutally honest and hard-nosed movie about someone whose life turns upside down. She (Cate Blanchett) has a difficult time navigating the changes. She takes psychotropic prescription drugs, she has had breakdowns, and she lives on the edge of lucidity.<br /><br />Some equate this with \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\" I can see that. But there is an additional layer of difficulty--as Jasmine (the character played by Blanchett) creates realities that are not accurate. She speaks of an idyllic start to her romance with her husband (a Bernie Madoff-like phony) and yet played a key role in his downfall.<br /><br />She wrecked a relationship with her son; she closed her eyes to possible irregularities in her husband's financial work.<br /><br />A powerful movie and worth a view. But, be forewarned, this is not a Woody Allen comedy. It is grim and powerful.
0307742539|5.0|Stieg Larsson continues to weave an exciting tale that keeps the reader completely involved with each of the characters. Wish there could be another sequel.
B00447G2PM|4.0|Very sharp movie. The colours are vivid. Informative, and the scenery is breathtaking! I wish the movie could have lasted a little longer.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|You have to pay money for tokens to play single matches. I wait ubtil I get free tokens to play. Yet it takes time to get them and only get 2-4 and takes 2 tokens to play a match. Ontop of that you don't get tokens when you win nor do you get the 2 refunded that you spent to play that match. I want to find a good truly free uno game
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I am an adult who enjoys YA literature (Marcus Zuzak, A.S. King, Hunger Games, etc. I was looking for some light summer reading and found some \\"best of YA\\" lists.  This is one of novels from that list.  I enjoyed the story...maybe a little more love story than I would normally like; however, I will definitely be reading the sequel.  I recommend this book.
0446554995|5.0|These books with Pendergast never go wrong. Always a please to read these books. These books can get anyone back into reading.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Even though you have to buy the additional Fairway's I play this game everyday, and the price for more GB 'S isn't that bad.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is an amazingly glorious series with perfectly paired costumes with music and scenery. The actors are completely convincing in their roles and draw you seemingly effortless into their characters. The portrayal of the countryside is stunning. I wish there were thousands of DVDs like this!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Me and my five year old daughter love to play this game together or we try to beat each other's  score
B001B9BEF4|5.0|Listen to this album. It is so good.  People are just getting more talented and they shine and that's why my dad did what he did and that's why I agreed to let my mother help me out and when she encouraged me to spend money. I knew she didn't't know what she was talking about. But it was easier to funnel funds between her many bank accounts.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was my favorite game! Awesome visuals and great storyline. This game always kept me guessing and wanting to know more. Very addicting! It was hard to put down.
B005HSL626|4.0|I think it's fun but just after a good use of time it starts to get boring<br />I recommend it but not five star-I luv it,recommend get it though.
0443069522|5.0|This new version of Gray's Anatomy is essential for students who need an anatomy book that is correlated with the clinical day-to-day. recommend to all interested in the subject..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is like temple run<br /> But way better.<br /> The only bad thing is they should give you more time to get characters.<br />  I deleted this game by accident and it deleted everything twice.<br /> But its fun<br /> I'm gonna give it five stars
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've enjoyed the series a lot! I have watched from the beginning, to end of season 3... I'm eager to see season 4 now! Definitely a fan!!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I have to recommend this game, it really is amazing, and raises the bar on other games that fall into this category. I have yet to find a game that is as entertaining as this one is. Great job people!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like hidden object games, so this is a game I enjoy. Nothing better than a free game that you enjoy playing.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|im still reading but im so intrigued that it is hard to put down and im looking forward to reading the rest of the series im also looking forward to watching the movie and hoping that they stay close as they can to the books
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Started out good but got just plain weird as the book went on.  Gone Girl was much better, consistent read.
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|I choose this rating because it is great album. I like it because since a long time I wanted the album in LP format. I would recommend it to Tame Impala fans.
B009HSPODE|5.0|What a superb writer! Alice Munro captures the essence of life & lives in small town Canada in wonderful vignettes, including some stories which are heartbreakingly autobiographical. A book of short stories to relish.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I have only one objection - somewhat too much blood on the screen. Besides of that - I liked this movie. Not sure that I'll watch it again but I've got my doze of fun from watching it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A brilliant, page-turning read,rather like a 'Pilgrim's Progress' for the modern day. The characters are well drawn and the story is unusual & intriguing. Thoroughly recommended.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Great topics discussing the first season of Beverly Hills 90210:  pregnancy, rape, crisis,... Lots of topics that still apply to many young people today.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I don't use it much but it fills the bill for our non-smart TVs or the ones not connected via Roku. It's compact and easy to use and set up. Great for Netflix subscribers who heretofore were unable to stream video.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been playing this game for years.  Each time I think I have exhausted it, new challenges appear.  This is one game where I really think I've gotten my money's worth.  It is my go-togame whenever I'm not sure about how much time I have, because there are many stopping places, so you don't lose any challenges you've completed.  I highly recommend this one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|See title. Need to fix the intermittent freezes but otherwise an awesome game. Very addicting and great concept. Keep up the good work!
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Loved the bittersweet, junky scenery of western Arkansas versus the beauty of the island. There's subtle humor in all the men giving Ellis advice about women and love. Tye Sheridan did a nice job as Ellis.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It looks just like in the ad.  I have several and this is one of the top ones I use because it makes an ideal bedtime clock.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I rarely find a game that I just get lost in. this is definitely one of them.so easy and basic but so dang fun.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I rely on this one on every Android device I own.  It is that good.  Lists or just text, it does it all easily.
B0058RCVYS|3.0|Rather melodramatic and didn't really engage with any of the characters so what you learn &#34;after the wedding&#34; wasn't as meaningful as it might have been had the character involved not been so over the top...
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Top notch performance.  I have found it very useful for determining signal strength of various wifi hotspots.  I use it when providing support for my clients to show them how their repeaters stack up.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|As a user of the initial Withings Scale and then the Smart Body Analyzer and the Blood Pressure cuff, even the Baby Monitor in years past, the new Pulse was a product I was prepared to like. But, it doesn't work. The Sleep Tracking feature worked three nights and then stopped. Wrote to Customer Service and no response. Followed all the instructions for a reset etc, all to no avail. All the other features work fine. No problems with battery life, etc. I've successfully operated the full Withings product line, but not the Pulse. So, why one star rating instead of four, if &#34;only&#34; one of the features is a fail? The Pulse simply does not work as designed and advertised. It's clearly not yet ready for release. An elegant product poorly executed.
0920668372|5.0|Despite the simplistic appearance of this book, I have found it to be the most moving book of all times.  It makes me cry every time I read it and just thinking about it gets me emotional.  I encourage all parents to get this book for their children, parents, best friend, etc. so that they, too, can celebrate the parent/child relationship.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Although is possible to see recent transactions, is not possible to see the day and value of the former ones.<br />But it's for free, that's a plus.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Everything this woman touches to gold and Blown Away is no different, I love to listen to her and I don't see it ending..
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I really like this app. Love that I can wake up to my music  and can listen with a sleep timer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and really funny and really makes temple run look out dated and boring. This is a must have if your into despicable me!!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|it is really fun. I highly recommend it. it is worth the download. get this app for a good time
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh my god that is one of if not the best book I have ever read. I cannot stop crying. This is the next book you should read.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I thought the book was well researched and put together. I hardly skipped any of the pages. Go for it.
1451626096|1.0|Let me start by saying that I enjoy Phillippa Gregory's books. I do think her Cousins series is weaker than her Tudor series but it's still enjoyable. It's nice to read how women have influenced history with their limited powers. But this book was drivel. It was like reading a National Enquirer version of Henry VII's life.<br /><br />  The book debunks any idea that Henry deserved to be King. He is portrayed as weak. unlikable, clueless as a leader, a mother's boy and a rapist. That's just the beginning. Apparently the only thing he does in his reign is to execute people horribly, tax the people to excess and lock people in the Tower. He is driven mad by seeing everyone as an enemy and continually looking for the Lost Princes.<br /><br />  Don't think Elizabeth comes out nicely in this version. She is supposedly madly in love with her uncle, King Richard. Uck uck. Still devastated by his death, she is hurriedly made ready to marry the man who dethroned and killed her lover. He rapes her repeatedly and yet she falls in love with him.<br /><br />  Please strain my creditability a little farther. OK, here is goes. She and her mother put a curse on the killer of her brothers last seen in the Tower. Here's the curse- the person who killed them will have their oldest son die and then the oldest grandson. Their line will end with a female. Really?<br /><br />  I cannot recommend this book at all. There's plenty of good things to read but this isn't one of them.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun game has a decent replay value doesn't hold attention for long per sitting though. But was definitely worth grabbing while free.
0425263908|5.0|I recommend this series!  Looking forward to #4.  Much better than 50 Shades, I thought!  Not as dominant and better reading.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Great movie, worth the cheap $8-10<br />For it. This is when F1 was really F1 or the start of the end depending how you look at it, not like today's cars. Whoever has the best engineers in today cars is most likely to win. it's not just based on the best driver, far from it!!! This is the last period in time where drivers really were driving the cars full out with out computers.  Man vs Man vs Mechine.
1608862771|5.0|While I will never sit still long enough to draw these elaborate scenarios, I love to look at them. FInding the tiny details hidden in each drawing is better than finding the proverbial needle in a haystack. The imaginative elements inspire me to add just a little more to my own drawings and activate my imagination.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie will be enjoyed by teenagers and parents alike.  It has interesting characters, an entertaining story and memorable scenery.
1592537251|5.0|The opportunity to glimpse inside the sketchbooks of artists all over the world makes this book a treasure. It made me realize that I could find something to draw wherever I may find myself. It is enlightening to see famous cities that I have visited; albeit in passing, & see them thru the eyes of its' resident artists. I look forward to checking out the &#34;Urban Sketchers&#34; on the web & in my neighborhood.
B003O6W30C|5.0|Another huge leap for the brothers. Really showing their growth and staying capabilities. Great mix of ballads, danceable and catchy tracks.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I love scifi shows, and Stargate Atlantis just got better every season. It sucks that it only went five seasons.
B0068RQ85K|5.0|actually, easier than pie  :)  Easy set up and use.  Plenty of instructions on line for more elaborate uses.  The only thing I would change is to inrease the length of the crank rods so one could make a coil longer than (almost) 6 inches.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Enjoyable hidden objects game. You need really good eyes for this one.  Could get expensive,as you have to pay for crystals.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, have been playing for months.  I had some highest scores, but it seems there are players that work one game until they can do it really fast.  It would be interesting to search on your best scores , etc.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|bought these to replace batteries in digital thermometer, they work and until the thermometer breaks physically ill have battery power.(it was only like $3, cheaper than buying (1or2) pack)
B004EHZPEG|4.0|The book is well written and gives a nice grasp of reality to its readers. You can get a good notion of what is the core business of game designing and see that it is a complex profession. Creating games is not an easy task, and this book explains why. It may not transform you into a professional, but it will surely help you to think through every step of how to create an experience that will not just please you, but other people also (wich would be your goal, anyways). Don't forget do download the smartphone app also, as it acts as a quick reference guide.
B009AY04A8|4.0|The story is fun and I so enjoy finding the hidden objects. I do think there was a little to much dialogue get tired of all the reading
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Use this app daily on kindle fire. Overall a great app. There are some issues with the maps one in awhile. Best out there in my opinion.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good twist of the old classic . I wish there are more upgrades added to the game. Definitely recommend  this game.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Entertaining look into a crummy, yet powerful recording studio. Sometimes the best stuff in art comes from the most unexpected places.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is an almost shockingly simple way to stream all kinds of video to your TV. Set-up is quick and takes only a minute or so. Using Chromecast is also simple. On your phone or tablet, a few apps (Netflix, YouTube, Google Music) have already been updated so that you just press a button to start streaming your selection on your TV. On your computer, you can stream anything in your Chrome browser, which allows you to stream other sources of internet video (like Hulu), even if they have a restriction against doing so. Hulu's odd device-restrictions on some video is no longer a problem with Chromecast. Additionally, because Chromecast uses the apps on your phone/tablet or Chrome on your desktop/laptop, there is not clunky UI to navigate. Just use the apps you're already familiar with.<br /><br />My roommates and love Chromecast so far. The only thing I'd like to see is Amazon release an app that allows you to stream Amazon Instant Video to it from a tablet or phone.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Drawn out but entertaining<br />Good job on character backgrounds<br />First part of book seemed to get bogged down with unneeded details
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game great stress reliever...Love the display on kindle fire. I play for hours and over time I try to better my scores by going back and replaying the levels.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is simple, yet addicting. Since getting it I think I've played at least once a day. I love that it gives you goals so that there is always something to strive for.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game !!! Being able to get to certain levels.and scores is awesome. Going into the cave with the tracks is.  Big challenge.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really love this game it can be very difficult some times but for the most part this is a fantastic game -mufasa
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just like I was playing at the arcade. The only thing it needs is a roller BALL controller. Overall great app. Give it a try
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Lots of twists and turns....thought provoking.  Wish I had seen it on the big screen.  Special effects were out of this world!
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Some of matthew's best work, and yes....we are on a first name basis. Give it a whirl. Your wont be disappointed.
B0008ENHT4|5.0|This movie does start out very slow and the story is very paced.  One has to remember that action movies and scenes during the 1960s were a far cry from the standard that we are exposed to, today.  I wouldn't say I was disappointed with the movie but you are fast to lose interest expecting more gun fights or car chases, lol.  I did enjoy seeing the style of the late 1960's through this movie and it makes you want to experience it.  Hey, I would watch it again!
B00AGKH45I|5.0|WOW WHAT A MASTERPIECE RUMORS IS AN AWESOME ALBUM I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO IT I JUST WISH ALL THE OTHER FLEETWOOD MAC ALBUMS WITH BUCKINGHAM-NICKS ESPECIALLY MIRAGE AND TANGO IN THE NIGHT WOULD GET THE REMASTERED DELUXE TREATMENT.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This movie for SURE, would be playing on Syfy right now if it were new!  Honestly you know what you are getting when you read the title!  However there is something about this movie that makes you want to see it again...and again ESPECIALLY for Halloween!  It's corny but it's a good kind of corny and it is definitely worth watching!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I guess I didn't do enough research before I purchased. I thought this would be bl to replace my apple  tv. I also thought this would be the best device if going to a friends house to plug in and show pictures from my device.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|The movie was just like brand new. Even in a protective wrapper. It worked perfectly. I love the saw series.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|To get \\"Scarface\\" on the screen filmmakers had to overcome many obstacles. This guide by Damian Stevenson is very interesting and informative. Taking us through each scene in detail, the author leads into the political aspects as well as the creative minds involved in the production of Scarface.<br />The depth of knowledge that went into this book is amazing and insightful. Crisp with new vision I will watch the movie Scarface again just so I can catch so many scenes I missed before.<br />Better prepared I will enjoy the movie with my husband this time.<br /><br />I give Scarface: The Ultimate Guide 5 stars and highly recommend it to all of you who often use the phrase, \\"Say hello to my leetle freend.\\"

1847084311|5.0|This astonishing historical novel opens in Hokitika, New Zealand in 1866, a gold mining town along the West Coast of the South Island. Founded two years previously, Hokitika is in the midst of a population boom, as prospectors, hoteliers and other businessmen have flocked there after news of its vast riches and promise of easy wealth has reached people living within and outside of New Zealand. One of those men is Walter Moody, a young Englishman who is trained in law but seeks gold to provide him with material comfort and the start of a new life. He arrives in town after a harrowing and emotionally distressing voyage at sea, and after he checks in at a local hotel he proceeds to its smoking room, where he hopes to unwind with a pipe and a stiff drink. Upon his arrival he notices that 12 men are already there, who appear to be from different backgrounds but also seem to have gathered in secret for a particular reason. The atmosphere in the room is tense and troubled upon his entry, but in his agitated state Moody doesn't sense that he has disturbed them. He is approached by one of the men, while the others appear to direct their attention toward their conversation, and after slowly gaining their confidence the men begin to share their intertwined stories with Moody, and the reason for their confidential meeting.<br /><br />The story is centered around several mysterious and apparently interconnected occurrences that took place two weeks previously on a single night, including the death of a hermit in a shack overlooking town, the disappearance of a young man who has struck it rich in a gold mine, and the apparent near suicide of the town's most alluring prostitute. Every man in the room claims to be innocent of any direct involvement, yet they all appear to share some responsibility in the events that led up to these crimes, and each one fears that he may be accused and held accountable.<br /><br />The reader learns more about these 12 men, Moody, and several other key players, as the story takes on a more defined shape. However, just as it seems to become more clear new twists arise and relationships emerge between previously unconnected characters, which made the tale more compelling and delightfully puzzling. I exclaimed out loud numerous times at various points (\\"Wait, what?\\" \\"Whoa!\\", etc.), and except for one relatively dead spot near the novel's midway point I was captivated from the first page to the last.<br /><br />No review could adequately convey the intricacy and complexity of this novel, along with its numerous subplots and themes, and Catton's ability to maintain its momentum through 832 pages was akin to a performer riding a fast moving rollercoaster while juggling various objects of different sizes for hours on end. My biggest critique is its ending, which felt rushed and overly tidy, and despite its length I would have preferred for it to have been extended by another 50-100 pages.<br /><br />\\"The Luminaries\\" is a masterful literary symphony, and a work of historical fiction that compares favorably with similarly superb novels such as The Children's Book, The Stranger's Child and The Glass Room. There are few books of this size that I would love to start reading again immediately after finishing it, but this is one of them, and young Ms Catton is to commended for a brilliant novel that should be a strong contender for this year's Booker Prize.ey players, as the story takes on a more defined shape.

0525478817|5.0|Hazel has never been anything but terminal...but when...Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazel's story is about to be completely rewritten. I was already rolling my eyes by the time I scanned the book flap; disliking this novel would be like telling someone you liked smothering puppies. How can you hate a story about kids with cancer?<br /><br />As a pediatrician who spends much of my day caring for hospitalized children, many whom are chronically ill just like Hazel Grace and Augustus, I'm always leery toward attempts to capture what it means to be a terminally ill young adult. Often such portrayals can seem sentimental and emotionally manipulative--in part to the grand Dalai Lama of Melodrama, Eric Segal, who essentially invented the genre with Love Story, published over 40 years ago. Indeed, it's now the middle-aged granddaddy of them all. Love Story (both the novel and film) set the stage for all succeeding contemporary cancer dramas. One can't evoke the image of a stricken Jenny Cavalleri in the bed, Oliver Barrett IV dutifully keeping watch by her bedside, without the music playing in the background, without the line which has now become a tired cliche: love means never having to say to you're sorry.<br /><br />Love, in fact, does nothing of the sort. There are plenty of things to be sorry about when dealing with love, and terminal illness, both things said and unsaid, near the end. Thus, how do you tackle such a tragedy with grace and humor, while avoiding sentiment and melodrama, yet keeping true to the tragedy? Exactly how John Green has done it here. Hazel Grace and Augustus are instantly real, and their voices and characters felt alive to me from the first scenes. Sure, they speak precociously, beyond their years with thoughts and language, but Green uses this license to advantage--after all, they both indeed are beyond their years in the deepest and most gravest sense. A sideline plot twist with a mysterious author who resides in Amsterdam was the only part I found less interesting; still, Green kept me going until the end. I really felt like he inhabited the world in which many of my patients find themselves trapped in, with his attention to details, the oncologic lingo. The way in which teenagers speak and live. The hospital is a place which Hazel Green and Augustus have both grown up in, and come of age in--stealing what little chance they've had at childhood. Green's characters are never flat, they're richly drawn, which makes this story even more damningly tragic. It made me want to be a better doctor.
B008JEJO88|5.0|Much softer cushion on the bottom.  They are a little narrower and a little shorter than the classic ones, but they still fit fine.  I would definitely buy them again.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is one of the best batman movies better then batman and robin and this is the better movie with bane in it
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|If you like Guy Clark, it's tough to hate any of his albums.  The writing continues to be first rate, the voice creaks with age and wisdom.  Not my favorite, but very enjoyable.<br /><br />How can you listen to the title track and feel how much he misses his wife?  Wow.....brings me to shivers every time it comes on.<br /><br />Probably not the best intro to his music, but it's still a damn fine album
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great little game, brings back memories of missile command from when I was younger. Worth a download, especially while it is free.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love the characters in this series and their interaction.  I look forward to whatever is going to happen next.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I rated it 5 stars because it is AMAZING I love these types of games and I want to<br />see the future updates and I can't wait!! :]
B007AL48UK|4.0|It's mahjong folks, pretty simple with a nice design.  The best part is you can match weather tiles! So sun and clouds makes a match instead of hunting forever for another sun.  Not great because you can't turn off the timer (who likes to be timed?) but pretty good.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Some parts take a bit of time but with a little patience you get to where you need to go. I tried this game and now I am hooked.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|Boring, very 2 dimensional, instructions are lousy, you have to just figure out what you're doing.  Repetitive and non-inspiring.  Could have been a lot better
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is fun and quick to play. Reminds me of my days playing an old wood grained console. The quick lvls make it good when you only have few minutes to kill.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by this author. Loved how all the stories connected at the end. Highly recommend it. Couldn't stop reading.
B00BWRT4KM|5.0|Up to now I had only seen 4 episodes of this show on a VHS tape.  Being a huge fan of Barbara Eden, who starred in this series before &#34;I Dream of Jeannie&#34;, I was delighted to see a DVD released with 9 episodes.  It is a fun disc and a great addition to my Barbara Eden collection.  To my knowledge this series has not been run on tv for many, many years and would most likely be unfamiliar to most viewers.  It is  another fun, nostalgic look back.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|How far will you go for a loved one? An unexpected end. Very touching. Highly recommend it. No wonder has been a best seller.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I'm a film soundtrack fan and this is possibly the best one every created!  After seeing the movie 3 times, and now having the music imprinted in my brain, I realize the film wouldn't be half as great without this music.  Hans Zimmer outdid himself! Words can't adequately  express the effect the music has- powerful, mesmerizing, haunting, beautiful, unforgettable.  People like to hear favorite selections, so I'll name them, but the whole 2 cd set is terrific.  My favorites are Sent Here for a Reason, If You Love These People, and Krypton's Last, but like I said, all the selections leave you stunned.  Definitely highly recommended.  Some reviewers said the fact that the selections were out of sequence bothered them.  I didn't care about that, I thought the music stood on it's own.  Also, don't listen to this while you're driving, because you may forget you're driving.  Can you tell I love it?
B000FC10QG|5.0|This all took place 25 years ago, but the story is still beautifully written and is intensely gripping, even if you know the outcome.  S
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's good so far, haven't run into any deal breaking issues. And it's a retake on the classic missile command from the atari days
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut is another one of his \\"semi-autobiographical\\" novels that features himself as the writer and narrator telling you about his fantastic journey to write a novel about the scientist that invented the atomic bomb.  The novel has just enough fact to be interesting and just enough fiction to keep you interested.  As with Vonnegut's other novels, this thing is chalked full of personal narratives on a wide variety of social issues and philosophical questions.  I actually found this novel more enjoyable than Slaughterhouse Five because I thought the characters were better and Vonnegut uses some black humour to push the story forward and make it entertaining.  At its core, Cat's Cradle deals with the philosophical question, \\"why do we make such deadly weapons, and why do we further compound our mistake by putting these deadly weapons in the hands of children (or adults that behave like children)?\\" The book is very heavy handed when it comes to religion, featuring the creation of a new religion, Bokonism, that directs butts against christianity in ideology.  If you are a christian and and do not like your religious views questioned, and sometimes out-righted mocked, I would just not bother to read this book.  On a side note, I noticed a very strong resemblance between the character Newt Hoenikker and Goerge RR Martin's Tyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones).  Part of me wonders if GRRM based Tyrion off Newt.  At the very least, they should make a movie just so they can cast Peter Dinklage as Newt.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the game is fun and challinging...I got it after I took my daughter to see dm2 she loves it but its a bit of a challange for her. I do wish there was more then 3 areas to run thrum though.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You can play this game and never have to spend money just keep playing. I like thay you can play and not spend money and still get the same thing others have it just takes longer but no moneys spent.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This app is so much fun! Both kids enjoy it and I find it to be completely addicting myself. Definitely glad I purchased the ad-free edition. No more interruptions during game-play.<br /><br />Love it!
B00992CF6W|1.0|omg omg I'm like so sad I spent forever building on my survival just to have it all gone like tht Its messed up  is there any way to change it back Cuz if there isn't no one should get this app pleese someone know how?
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie has crazy action, it's hilarious, and with the exception of the rather heavy violence and some language the movie itself is quite appropriate. The actors are fantastic; especially Norris!
B0095VPAVE|5.0|Put a new machine together using this CPU with the integrated graphics. I've got some dedicated video cards lined up but the integrated graphics works well enough to keep things going in the mean-time.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought \\"Song of Ice and Fire Book 1:Game of Thrones\\" Kindle edition (for reading convenience) as well as a hardcover copy (which came with the 5-book Song & Fire series hardcover set) for my book collection.<br /><br />In terms of the story, I became a fan of the \\"a Song of Ice and Fire\\" series after watching the HBO TV adaptation (\\"Game of Thrones\\").  I decided to read the books because I was too impatient to wait for the next season to start.  I don't regret the decision at all; though I know the main story lines from watching the TV series, the book's character development and the background history is much deeper than the HBO series (although the TV series is a pretty fair representation of the book's plot lines and character personalities).<br /><br />So basically all I have to say is, if you enjoyed the TV series you will enjoy reading the first book because it offers more history, more characters and more clarifications and revelations in the context of the main plot.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Old skool gets an update very fun.<br /><br />Ability to upgrade weapons at no additional cost is very nice.  Think missle command fior the atari
B005MHI0QM|5.0|It is a good book full of drama love life and more if you like drama love ect then this book is for you

B00006CXSS|5.0|I find myself constantly watching this series, sometimes on a daily basis, because it's that good. By any measure it's the best World War 2 docudrama ever made. And, it follows the facts of the Steven Ambrose book very accurately also.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a good way to pass the time and work out your brain.  It is a well made product that is easy to use.
B00009NHC5|4.0|I love this movie, the ending is great, but can someone please tell me why the door is never locked?

B00DHNBPA6|5.0|this move was great and scared me. Not your typical boring scary movies. This was a great scary movie with lots of gore, and will make you think twice about scary movies next time. very well made and surprisingly good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie is very well thought out with an engaging plot for the kids as well as excellent, subtle humor throughout that mostly only adults understand. My kids, my husband, and I think it's a great movie overall.  The kids have probably now seen it five times.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Best musical ever. My 8 year old and her friends are singing the Music Man songs all the time. Spectacular
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Good so far<br /><br />The new year and the other side of the world is going to be a good thing to say that I am not sure if I am looking forward to the other day that you can see.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was the bees knees yeaaaaaaaaaalhhhhhh<br />I love the pics and stuff maaaaaaaaaan. Yes haw good job you guys.<br />Love the mystery of the game but the creepy music is super weird yo. Lolololololololol
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A fun game, different spin on the old classic..........without the rollerball! The touch screen makes it too much fun. Thank you free app of the day
B002AWX6UM|2.0|The book could have been more exciting, it didn't exactly hold up my interest as much as I thought it would. It was touching of how he survived the war, but the author just seemed to drag on and on. The plot itself was fine, though.
159562015X|5.0|Totally recommended. Helps you understand what strengths you possess and how to take advantage of them to be successful professionally and personally
B000FC11A6|5.0|The only thing that makes Cryptonomicon better is going back farther in time and reading the Baroque Cycle.<br /><br />Bought it on Kindle this time so that I can read it any time, anywhere.
B008220BLG|5.0|This is a great movie, both fun and clever.  Teens in love.  Who knew zombies could do more than chew flesh?
0345528581|5.0|We were pleased with the timeliness, condition and price of my book. This certainly met every positive expectation We had.

B0098VXN2Y|4.0|CAMERON DIAZ  IS A GREAT ACTRESS.  THIS WAS A FUNNY MOVIE THAT KEPT IT LIVE.  EVEN MY HUBBY ENJOYED WATCHING WITH ME
0060527986|5.0|This little book is both a quick read and lingering meditation food. Even though it is quick to read the actual words, the ideas are deep and need slow rolling over in the mind, contemplation, journaling and more attention. It is filled with profound ideas, and I recommend it to the seeker of Truth.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I like, I can either write or type my notes. They are save to review later. And it just simple to use.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun and don't need wifi to play. Beautiful graphics lots of levels, lots of my friends like it too I am out of words so my 'review is over
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great scenary, interesting history of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Maggie Smith is wonderful. Her character has wit and intelligence. The whole cast is outstanding. But the drama tends to be somewhat trite and cliche. Is there not a happy ending in sight????
B000FA675C|5.0|Write your review here. (required)<br />Who would you recommend this book to? Mom<br />Why.did you chose this rating? I enjoyed it more then the movie.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis continues his trend of writing readable books and this one is no exception.  The book is interesting, informative and danged scary. If you have any money invested anywhere you'll want to read this book.  And then hide your money under your mattress.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Very nice songs,  Justin singing is mesmerizing. For all of justin fan. You will not be disappointed with this album, a must have.
1250012570|5.0|I just finished Eleanor & Park and it has become one of my all-time favorite books. I laughed through the entire book and cried (a lot) when I finished it. I could not put it down. The characters are written so beautifully and their story is so easy to relate to. This book is an absolute gem. I am ordering the audio version now, just so I can experience it again. Buy this book; you will not be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a very slow moving book.  I couldn't stay awake.  A friend stated it really became interesting about half way thru.  I'm over half way and still am not very thrilled about it.  We are reading it for my book club, if it wasn't for the meeting I wouldn't waste my time to finish it.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|There are a few shows out there that you can put on for your kids that won't also sap you of your will to live.  This type of programming is incredibly valuable to parents, and Shaun the Sheep is a shining example of the genre.  Now if only we could get Season 3 over here in the US...
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Informative but predictable. I was hoping for more history and less drama.  I needed eight more words to post this comment
B007N85POS|5.0|I love angry birds, never get bored with this or any other Angry Birds games. definitely fun and easy to navigate.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I love It Sounds Great!!!This is the best album I ever heard. Amazon went out of their way to get me this album.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I found this book hard to put down. I was drawn to the main character and felt like what was happening to her could happen to any of us. The ending was a surprise. I would definitely look at other books by this author.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Complete and easy to follow directions on how to publish on Kindle. It made the task simple. also a good primer on MS Word functions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is awesome!!! I love challenging games and am ready for the other levels!!!! it took me a few me else to get the swing of it...but LOVE IT
B004MPEFBE|5.0|I love Harry potter.  The movies bring the characters. to life!  This one is a little dark and scary.  Defects the nook.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I HAD LOTS OF FUN FIGURING OUT THE LEVELS. When are the new levels available.  I'm poking forward to them.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Three great songs. Last track is a bit repetitive. A bit repetitive. Overall great work. Hope her full album continues the same feel/theme.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Fun game. Got this one from free app of the day. Not overly challenging but a great way to pass the time as I am an avid hidden objects player. Down side there is way to much talking. Recommend speed reading. Overall pleased
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Excellent movie...good quality just as good as seeing in the movie theater ......very happy that it came to amazon so fast ..
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have Direct TV and every time it storms of course the TV goes out.  It was very nice to be able to see the radar of the storm on my Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it fun and easy to work my two year old enjoys her time with her horse and knows how to use it all by herself
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Great game, lots of heart. A funnier version of snes Final Fantasy games. Support the independent, you will not be disappointed.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|For a person of weak faith this book I am afraid will be very disturbing. But if your faith is secure this book will give you plenty to reflect on and to discuss. However as with many of the books listed as sources by the author one is still left with the question of whether or not we will ever \\"really\\" know the \\"historical\\" Jesus.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good missile command version for a touch screen. Not quite as cool as the original ball roller control, but fun.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Survival under the most tragic and tough circumstances makes this show so enjoyable. It is unbelievable but was excellent in every aspect of bringing it to the big screen.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Lots of great music and a great variety, especially with it being free.  Much better than Sirius and it's free.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I like science fiction and this one makes you think. Had to watch it twice to fully understand the show.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Overall it is a fun app, pretty addicting.. graphics could be better. Will continue to play despite costly upgrades and expansions. Occasionally force closes upon opening.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I am using this tiny bluetooth transmitter with my Apple Nano 6 generation iPod attached to a wrist band to connect to my bluetooth headset while I run. This is a wonderful device and pairs instantly.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|lots of crashes  could be a fun game too bad spent way too much time trying to retrieve game glad it was free
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|... produces clear audio sound and works well for video recordings featuring presentations and interviews. I recommend it if you want quality recordings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this app. They play it all the time and the minions are so cute. Fun. Fun. Fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is absolutely great, perfect interface and incredibly usefull (especially when I forget mine on Sundays or Monday night college groups lol)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is fun and challenging. You will find yourself thinking about these puzzles long after you have turned off the game.
B000I186FW|5.0|Set in the not to distant future, where a totalitarian government controls the United Kingdom, the title character 'V' is conducting a campaign of terror against tyranny. Disfigured by his arrest and mistreatment of this government, he escaped to seek revenge on those responsible. He enlists the aid of Evey, played by Natalie Portman. Without to much explanation about the plot, the movie is about people having the courage to stand up to tyranny, and this is why I like it. I also like the 'V' character wearing the Guy Fawkes mask throughout the film. This mask has been adapted by protesters around the world who demonstrate against repressive governments, and also used by the 'Anonymous' group to hide their true identities. I would compare it to the '1984' novel and movies, except this time the good guys win.
B009R54MGW|3.0|It would be easy to draw that conclusion from this account of her marriage to Henry V11. I usually like Philippa Gregory's historical novels but this one had little substance. Elizabeth's constant reply to Henry's questions of \\"I don't know\\" really annoyed me. It made her sound dim witted. And was Henry so fearful and so lacking in character as Gregory had him? We'll never know for sure but I doubt it. The intrusion of recent words and phases also was jarring. Overall, too much rambling and the main characters came across as shallow.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|i thought this was going to suck and it turned out to be hilarious.. dudes take it from a dudes dude like me, this movie is actually good and has many top lelz
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Super fun game great app.wish the chests weren't always pearls. Great graphics. Wish you could gift your friends. My girls like it to. T h e music is relaxing. I like collecting the different types of fish. Growing plants is fun to helps time go by. It doesn't however have action.
0061122416|5.0|According to the author, this book is a metaphor of his journey toward finding himself.  It's beautifully written and hard to put down.  I love it!  I've read it several times.  Coelho is an excellent writer!!!
B00640UICA|5.0|*SQUEE* VERY cute graphics and sounds.  Fun puzzle game that gets progressively more challenging.  Very easy to get hooked on....hours passed without me realizing.... ^_^;;;  I like the little detail on the title screen...it starts off with just one creature, and as you unlock each stage, another one will pop up on the screen.  Very nicely done!
1476715904|5.0|I would reccommend these sellers. They were quick about getting books out. the books were all in shape described. very very satisfied with their service and look for them in the future for other purchases.
B007AL48UK|5.0|great for relaxation. I highly recommend mahjong in all its forms as a break from everyday stress. it might not be as effective as meditation but it gives me a needed diversion when I cant focus.
B002S43V3Y|5.0|There are a million ways to be! A classic in the struggle against mortality. I saw it 30 years ago and again now with my son - inspiring both times.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|way cool this game rocks and. it is way fun it is deffinatley worth the one dollar.  this game is fun for everyone kids or adults. it is a all around fun game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game that's all I ha two say but other than that you should get it it is really great for family's to play also great for the kids
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very enlightening!  New perspectives expounded upon.  Worth reading more than once.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Thanks to the hard work, extensive research of Mr. Aslan.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I got this game for my son and at first he was excited about playing it but that was soon overcome by frustration as he realized how long it takes to earn money and jewels to complete the tasks and that most are actually impossible to complete without spending real money. He would still play it occasionally but after the app installed an automatic update yesterday the game refuses to open up at all. Glad it's a free app to install or I'd be pretty pissed right now!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, well designed. Easy enough on the lower levels, but quite challenging as you progress. Plus has an element of strategy as you decide how to upgrade.
B000OSDSKM|5.0|Great movie!  Interesting plot!  Could happen even today. Plotting a government takeover and secret pentagon funds!  It could be right out of todays headlines.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|For $35 this thing does exactly what it needs to. There's appreciable lag when casting from Chrome. Video and audio quality otherwise, especially from YouTube and Netflix, is solid.<br /><br />I bought it to see what it would do mostly from a curiosity standpoint. This is no replacement for a Roku or Apple TV. For an extra $40-70, I would recommend either these over the Chromecast.
0525478817|5.0|From the title, you can guess that I'm not all that deep of a person. I generally like to read fiction as an escape. I don't like mean characters (hence, my dislike of most great literature). And I generally like happy endings.<br /><br />This is a recipe for me not liking this book.<br /><br />But oh my goodness this book was fantastic. The characters are prematurely mature - they quote things that most college students can't. And yet, it doesn't seem far fetched to me. It fits the mood of the book. The snappy, sarcastic, intellectual tones that lay over an emotional cauldron - first love, true love, and death.<br /><br />There are so many intriguing sound-bite philosophies in this book: from time being a slut (people are forgotten after they die), to different kinds of infinities, to treading lightly vs heavily on the universe. Big, important concepts encapsulated in witty quotes by dying teenagers.<br /><br />I absolutely loved every second of this book. I knew how it would end almost from the beginning, but it still didn't prepare me for the tragedy. And still, no regrets. It's a great book.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I had to return my first one as the unit wouldn't hold a charge. Overall the controller's build quality is mediocre. It feels solid but the analog sticks aren't particularly smooth and the buttons aren't very crisp. It's not a ripoff for the money but its certainly not a deal either. At least the layout is better than the standard dual shock (though the stock controller is superior in all other ways)
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Wish I could remember every chapter! A fascinating look into the capacity of the brain, and the capability to train it...with enough patience and perfect practice.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Bought this to watch with my grandkids, ages 4 and 9.  They both love it, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected to!  Definitely recommend it........
B008602KQI|5.0|Mystical fantasy, violent but not too gory, unconditional love, and sacrifice for one's country. Jennifer Lawrence really proves herself to be a versatile actress.  I'm inspired to take up archery now.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book illustrates to us personally how much power we hold in our own lives. It's written in a very down to earth way, funny, and the experiments really work. I highly recommend checking this download out!
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|Bloody and stupid.  It always amazes me that so many &#34;professional&#34; people can come together on a movie project and allow something this bad to go out with their name attached to it.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I enjoyed the book but not as much as the Kite Runner, I found the switch back wards and towards the present day confusing and would like to read again now that I know how the characters fitted in. I like the descriptions of the mountains and pictures of Kabul & his home town.<br />I will read again as I read it first on a plane and I know I shall enjoy it more
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|With 6 seasons in the can, this is still the series to watch.  How can you not love Dexter, even with all his issues.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging and thought provoking. Good graphics. Sharp images and good color. Moves quickly and keeps players interest. Enjoying playing this game.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game Brings back some fun times I had as a kid. I.Played for hours then and will plays for hours now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good story. I could hardly put it down. It makes you wonder what could really happen to humanity in such a situation.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If you read the reviews they basically say the same thing.  Great idea but somewhat limited....for now.  There are great expectations about adding other features but who knows when.  Until then I do use it for the features it has and it's nice that I can use it from my iPad, SG$ and my MacBook Air.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The unit performed as expected. Setup was easy an affordable way to get media and web wirelessly to tv. For the price brilliant.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This gave me a different view of the German people and particularly the men flying the aircraft in this war over Europe.  It is a great story of mankind helping each other regardless of whether or not you are on different sides of a argument.  As Christ says Love Your Enemy.
1594481717|4.0|As best summarized by the author: \\"This book describes a seismic--though as yet undetected--shift now under way in much of the advanced world. We are moving from an economy and a society built on the logical, linear, computerlike capabilities of the Information Age to an economy and a society built on the inventive, empathic, big-picture capabilities of what's rising in its place, the Conceptual Age.\\"<br /><br />Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"A change of such magnitude is complex. But the argument at the heart of this book is simple. For nearly a century, Western society in general, and American society in particular, has been dominated by a form of thinking and an approach to life that is narrowly reductive and deeply analytical. Ours has been the age of the \\"knowledge worker,\\" the well-educated manipulator of information and deployer of expertise. But that is changing. Thanks to an array of forces - material abundance that is deepening our nonmaterial yearnings. globalization that is shipping white-collar work overseas, and powerful technologies that are eliminating certain kinds of work altogether--we are entering a new age. It is an age animated by a different form of thinking and a new approach to life--one that prizes aptitudes that I call \\"high concept\\" and \\"high touch.\\" High concept involves the capacity to detect patterns and opportunities, to create artistic and emotional beauty, to craft a satisfying narrative, and to combine seemingly unrelated ideas into something new. High touch involves the ability to empathize with others, to understand the subtleties of human interaction, to find joy in one's self and to elicit it in others, and to stretch beyond the quotidian in pursuit of purpose and meaning.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"With more than three decades of research on the brain's hemispheres, it's possible to distill the findings to four key differences. 1. The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body; the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body. 2. The left hemisphere is sequential; the right hemisphere is simultaneous. 3. The left hemisphere specializes in text; the right hemisphere specializes in context. 4. The left hemisphere analyzes the details; the right hemisphere synthesizes the big picture.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"Three forces are tilting the scales in favor of R-Directed Thinking. Abundance has satisfied, and even oversatisfied, the material needs of millions--boosting the significance of beauty and emotion and accelerating individuals' search for meaning. Asia is now performing large amounts of routine, white-collar, L-Directed work It significantly lower costs, thereby forcing knowledge workers in the advanced world to master abilities that can't be shipped overseas. And automation has begun to affect this generation's white-collar workers in much the same way it did last generation's blue-collar workers, requiring L-Directed professionals to develop aptitudes that computers can't do better, faster, or cheaper.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"We moved from the Agriculture Age to the Industrial Age to the Information Age. The latest instance of this pattern is today's transition from the Information Age to the Conceptual Age once again fed by affluence (the abundance that characterizes Western life), technological progress (the automation of several kinds of white-collar work), and globalization (certain types of knowledge work moving to Asia).\\"<br /><br />5- \\"In the Conceptual Age, we will need to complement our L-Directed I reasoning by mastering six essential R-Directed aptitudes. Together these six high-concept, high-touch senses can help develop the whole new mind this new era demands. 1. Not just function but also DESIGN. 2. Not just argument but also STORY. 3. Not just focus but also SYMPHONY. 4. Not just logic but also EMPATHY. 5. Not just seriousness but also PLAY. 6. Not just accumulation but also MEANING.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"Design is a high-concept aptitude that is difficult to outsource or automate--and that increasingly confers a competitive advantage in business. Good design, now more accessible and affordable than ever also offers us a chance to bring pleasure, meaning, and beauty to our lives. But most important, cultivating a design sensibility can make our small planet a better place for us all.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Stories are easier to remember--because in many ways, stories are how we remember. \\"Narrative imagining-- story--is the fundamental instrument of thought,\\" writes cognitive scientist Mark Turner in his book The Literary Mind. \\"\\"<br /><br />8- \\"Story exists where high concept and high touch intersect. Story is high concept because it sharpens our understanding of one thing by showing it in the context of something else..., Story is high touch because stories almost always pack an emotional punch.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"\\"Storytelling doesn't replace analytical thinking,\\" he says. \\"It supplements it by enabling us to imagine new perspectives and new worlds. . .. Abstract analysis is easier to understand when seen through the lens of a well-chosen story. \\" Now Denning is spreading his message-- and telling his story--to organizations worldwide. \\"<br /><br />10- \\"Like drawing, Symphony is largely about relationships. People who hope to thrive in the Conceptual Age must understand the connections between diverse, and seemingly separate, disciplines. They must know how to link apparently unconnected elements to create something new. And they must become adept at analogy--at seeing one thing in terms of another. There are ample opportunities, in other words, for three types of people: the boundary crosser, the inventor, and the metaphor maker. \\"<br /><br />11- \\"Empathy is the ability to imagine yourself in someone else's position and to intuit what that person is feeling. It is the ability to stanc in others' shoes, to see with their eyes, and to feel with their hearts. It is something we do pretty much spontaneously, an act of instinct rather than the product of deliberation. But Empathy isn't sympathy--that is, feeling bad/or someone else. It is feeling with someone else, sensing what it would be like to be that person. Empathy is a stunning act of imaginative derring-do, the ultimate virtual reality--climbing into another's mind to experience the world from that person's perspective. \\"<br /><br />12- \\"Empathy is neither a deviation from intelligence nor the single route to it. Sometimes we need detachment; many other times we need attunement. And the people who will thrive will be those who can toggle between the two. As we've seen again and again, the Conceptual Age requires androgynous minds.\\"<br /><br />13- \\"\\"The opposite of play isn't work. It' depression. To play is to act out and be willful, exultant and committed as if one is assured of one's prospects. -BRIAN SUTTON-SMITH \\"<br /><br />14- \\"\\"Laughter can play a major role in reducing stress in the workplace,' he says. Kataria says that businesses believe that \\"serious people are more responsible. That's not true. That's yesterday's news. Laughing people are more creative people. They are more productive people. People who laugh together can work together.\\" \\"<br /><br />15- \\"Our fundamental drive, the motivational engine that powers human existence, is the pursuit of meaning.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I'd love to have this movie in my favorite collector's items.  I saw it at the theater and could not wait for it to come out on dvd.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Excellent writing! The cast is interesting and very likable.  Only suggestion is to eliminate the use of G--D---.  It doesn't enhance anything and really makes most people I know cringe.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|this is a great app! it is the same as the original star girl just the town looks like Italy. its also good to have it because if you have both apps then you can earn twice the money because you can do two jobs at once. also when u run out of energy on one (witch is also another version of money on the app. you earn one back every six minuets.) so this is good! if you would like to add me on the app, my ID is s8pqh. thanks!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A return to manners and wit! A lovely program.  This show is very well cast.  The actors are incredibly believable.  I look forward to each and every episode and have not been disappointed yet.  Family friendly.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's just okay... Better than most of the free games I have tried so far. I enjoy the search and find but it is very repetitive.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son is 2 and loves this app, the puzzles are very age appropriate and I love that they have have a reward type system inter graded  into it, for example the one puzzle once he finishes it balloons come up that he gets to pop which is apparently a lot of fun to a 2 year old a little warning to parents the noises can get a bit overwhelming but that's seems to be par for the course at this age
B00CATSONE|5.0|One never know who is good who is bad, what is a true, what is a fantasy. But book is good
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I have Wi-Fi network and sometimes I want to play online and it won't let me in sometimes when my WiFi network is high please fix it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story and the acting were superb.  The characters were always interesting and the plot twists very creative.  Can't wait for next season.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is pretty good. It does get boring after a while. If you want a game that can get you through area trip or plane ride this game will be perfect.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|One of the all time great television shows, this season pitting Walter White against Gus Fring in a steel cage deathmatch. Not to be missed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and that's why I love it its like the best game in the whole wide work.
0891419195|5.0|Better than the movie - Sledge's tale is full of details, emotion and imagery that really touched me.  Highly recommended.
0140143505|4.0|This book is a series of letters between a New York screenwriter and a book store in London. I did not even have a chance to move this from my \\"want to read\\" list to put it on my \\"currently reading\\" list as it is only 95 pages of light reading with about a letter per page of correspondence over a 20 year period. Book is regarded as a classic and evidently a movie was made about it but I had never encountered it until I came across mention of it in a review and thought it sounded interesting. I had not been aware of the trials the British faced in terms of rationing after the war ended and how long it lasted and what one would do for the prices of the those days! Leather bound first editions for $2. Wow. Surprising how much character development the author achieved in such a short span and how much one could come to care for the participants.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great free down loads. I really like how you can change the size of the pieces to  make th  puzzle challenging.
0062255657|2.0|Well written but since I am not a fan of extreme fantasy, this one does not come out high on my list. I don't know how I missed being tipped off to the content of this story but in for a penny, in for a pound so I had to find out how it ended. Pretty bizarre!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is entertaining and a good way to spend any extra time you may have.<br />Hope this helps anyone wanting to buy it.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|The story was interesting, and I didn't know anything about Catherine's illness, so that was interesting as well, but the book was too long, and for me there was absolutely no suspense. I think E. Haynes should have  written the same story in a shorter book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my son and I love the movies and the game! we compete to see who gets the higher score and unfortunate to say... he usually beats me :).
B00BKTFABE|1.0|I almost always want to be in landscape view, and being forced to switch to portrait view is very irritating.  It isn't just the menu of the app that's in portrait.  The Kindle Fire's main menu is forced into portrait view;  and unless you're good ad working sideways, you have to switch around to operate the menu to kill the app and get back to portrait mode.  Unforgivable.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoy military themed autobiographies. This man was there! Standing at the gate showing and telling America's enemies, not any further!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I give only 4 stars because this game is too addictive.  It is so easy to lose track of time while playing it.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|More James Bond adventures hidden behind Ian Fleming as the main character.<br />If you enjoy reading Bond novels you'll probably like this one
B000N90JG8|5.0|Seen it three time and now can see if forever. Jack Nicholson should be rated the best actor of all time.
0812993845|4.0|I would probably have given this book 3 1/2 stars if it were possible.  That being said, I rounded up because, hey, it's a beach read book not War and Peace.<br /><br />Kinsella's books are light-hearted fare that keep the story humming along while providing at least a few out loud chuckles.  This book, while maybe not her best work, was no exception.  I read this book in a day and it held my interest.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Why play any other bingo game Bingo blitz is one app you will always go to for fun and excitement
B009JZWO3I|5.0|All seasons are great and this one doesn't disappoint this viewer. The last few episodes had me on the edge of my seat. Julianne Margulis is outstanding in this role. Starting with the pilot, this show has never let me down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun you can play with many different minions in the game. It is really fun for kids and you can play with your family they will love it too.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Can't even open the game on my kindle fire. It just force closes everytime. Waste of time so don't bother.
B00499NHLC|1.0|Don't care for this do-over with new actors!  I much prefer the old series.  Would love to see the old series available for watching!!!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|THERE IS NO STURDINESS TO THIS STAND.  WANTED SOMETHING I COULD PLACE ON MY LAP OR TABLE AND THEN ENJOY READING.  THIS DOESN'T CUT IT. TOO FLIMSY.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|I had to read this book for school over the summer.. at first not to excited but then the rest was kinda predictable but still good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely adore this app!!! I think that it is perfect for any horse lover out there! I think that it is over the top for a free app it's like I really have a horse!!!
B00BSWMITK|4.0|One of my favourite guitarists Joe Satriani,his guitar skills are like no other the guitar wizadry and signature licks are awesome,another excellent CD from Joe Satch.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Addicting, better that you can upgrade with gold vs gems.  Games free I think you should be able to urn more gems vs having to pay real cash. Very disappointed!!!!!
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Watched this movie on my computer - in a dark room- upstairs.  Love scary movies!  This one scared me half to death!!  If you like scary stuff - then watch this one!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The parts I know how to use are very good. With time, I should get full use from the app.
B004FQX59I|5.0|JFK movie was very good.  Did not believe that he would but Kevin Costner did an excellent job as JFK.  I loved it!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun, but too much time between games. Haven't had a bingo yet but came close. Keeps you on your toes especially using multiple cards.
B00B49GSOS|5.0|I bought this movie for my mother for her birthday. She has the Lord of the Rings trilogy and really wanted this movie. I had to get it for her before she bought it for herself. She loves it!
B008K7RGA2|4.0|This Production of Tosca has a Dream Cast, all of whom lived up to my expectations. Production is a Traditional one from the Royal Opera House and was most enjoyable.
1442413611|4.0|The Debate: People are going to argue over whether it's appropriate for pre-teens and teens to be reading about drug use, \\"snogging\\" (making out for us Americans), generally being nasty little wretches (bane of society), etc. While I can't claim to be particularly thrilled with how everything in the book panned out - and I was quite annoyed with several sections - all things considered, it's probably worlds \\"cleaner\\" than anything they'd (12-14 yr olds) find on TV. In that sense, if you're worried about something your kid might read, try it yourself and then make a decision based on your own beliefs and opinions rather than 2nd hand info from an amazon reviewing stranger.<br /><br />Minor annoyances: Hazards of reading a teen book: high school/ middle school drama. Plotting was kinda far-fetched. The chapter titles are in a relatively hard to read font. I know it's there for the \\"cool\\" effect, but eh, I just file it under \\"minor annoyance.\\"<br /><br />Good Stuff: There's an interesting cast of characters here. They're not perfect. They do make mistakes.<br /><br />Cool concept. Kids get to be spies. Sweet.<br /><br />The minorly confusing: There are a lot of characters, but the author does a nice job of providing brief introductions to each in case you jump into the series beyond book one. The target audience is probably 11-14 but some content seems aimed much higher (drug references, poor decisions) and other content seems aimed much lower (silly kid humor, ie. burping contest).<br /><br />Conclusion: I'll probably give more books in this series a chance. It's one of those rare YA finds that will appeal to young males as well as females. Those tend to be a little hard to find.
B005PK56TA|2.0|If it is not believable than I have no interest.  Why are you demanding that I type a minimum number of words?  That is another form of stupidity.  I told you in one sentence how I feel about the movie.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|in I Am Number Four, Alex Pettyfer has given &#34;Good vs evil&#34; in a new format. Fun CGI and true love (what is true?)
B003ZDNWOA|5.0|With the heightened emotion of their relationship adding an effervescent backdrop the guide conveys a Pollyanna view. Read the sunshine of their prism and be charmed as I was
B004X75RK4|5.0|My teenage daughters love this movie and I don't mind watching it with them. It's got the love story for them and it has the laughs for me. I recommend it
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I have looked for a scientific reason for people not being able to become successful in any aspect of life. This book gives you an answer with a solution. Everyone working with children should read this book.
0060794410|4.0|It was easy to listen to when you do not have time to read the book. An updated version would be helpful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you're not happy with just the stars then stop bothering. I have no intentions of wasting my time trying to come up with enough words to keep you happy. And if this means you don
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun and somewhat challenging to play but slightly repetitive on each round. Add more diversity and would definitely be five stars
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The story is suspenseful and extremely well written. Love watching David Tennant as the lead in this. He plays his character well.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I got this to entertain my grand-kids ages 6 and 9. It's one of their favorite games. They love trying to figure out how to save Roby.
1609611543|4.0|Some weight loss.  Most important, however it has reduced my insulin use and I only take 4 shots  day, by dropping Symlin shots
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I love this movie. I loved Shaun of the Dead. I can't wait to see the final installment of the \\"Cornetto trilogy\\". I'm a huge Simon Pegg fan.<br /><br />I love the tongue in cheek style in which these actors make fun of classic genres. I don't take the films too seriously and for a change neither do the cast of the film. They enjoy making fun of the stereotypes and they do it in a manner that keeps the film watchable escapist fare.
B005LAII44|1.0|this was scratched and before we played the cd we had thrown out all the packaging. I had bought it for my little brother as a gift. he was disappointed.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch hasn't lost a thing over the years. You'll recognize this as pure Clutch right away but  all new at the same time. If you are a Clutch fan, you won't even read this; If you're not a fan, you will be after hearing this album! : )
0679746048|5.0|This book was fantastic. She writes in a way where you can feel you are right there with her. It's a quick read, and it's worth ordering the movie too and watching it when you finish the book, both are AMAZING.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game. Im mostly making this review for the extra points but, if they give em to you...  might aswell right?
B000068FXX|5.0|Nice quality sound. I always liked Supertramp, thought they had a great sound. That quality shows through on the reissue.
142314189X|5.0|This is a great series, if not a collector, get the paperbacks, otherwise for collectors a great set with great stories.
0802473156|5.0|Great relationship book for anyone of all ages whether you are in a relationship or not!  My husband is a psychologist and had it on his bookshelf for years...he does a lot of couples counseling.  After it was recommended as a great book to enhance or save a relationship by a friend, I read his then I bought them as gifts for my 2 children 26 and 28 years old.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game was really fun. I had a blast playing it and would recommend it to others it did seem a little easy tho.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Game is good but it hard locks and has came issues. Is getting better but far from great.  When having to reload the game no way to restart were you left off.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|One<br />.make copper more common.<br />.ad more animals.<br />And it will be BETTER.<br />So yeah ad more animals and easy to find copper:-)
B005LAII08|5.0|Great game for my little grandson, it is more then just a playstation sitter .  it allows children to exercise creativity and keeps them engaged in play. The quality of the program was well worth the expense it is great for boys and girls .
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It is a great series. I watched all 4 series and enjoyed every one.  I was really sorry they didn't continue with Lara (Laura) or at least a spin off.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Got it for my kindle on the free day. Seems pretty good so far though the repair point gaining system takes a little figuring out in terms of how many you actually gain per round.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I don't read many books. But this one captured me and kept me engaged.  I hated to know Job's personal traits. What a brilliant man with what a poor people personality.  As his commercial says, you can like or hate him, glorify or vilify him, you cannot ignore him.  He was crazy enough to think he can change world.  He really did.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game is a lot of fun, but since the update yesterday, it no longer works correctly. New load screen, then app starts downloading the patch.... no problem there. App then restarts; first screen, white background and in big bold letters, &quot;STRING NOT FOUND&quot;  ok this is strange.... never seen that message before... and the game continues to load, the progress bar goes about half and then it crashes and returns me to the home screen. It's the same story for my S4 &amp; nexus 7. I'm pretty sure it's a corrupted file, or an incomplete or missing line off code or something. Hopefully the developer has been made aware of the issue and is working to resolve it. Right now I would not recommend downloading this game, it doesn't work. I just hope that it doesn't make me restart my entire game over because it plays the opening movie as if I started a new campaign. I would give this game five stars but since it's all borked at the moment it gets 1 star since I can't give 0. That's not cuz it sucks just cuz it's broke. And I'm not the only one with this issue, so come on game loft, fix your shit!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a truly amazing and touching book. I could not up it down and wish there were more to read!

B007AL48UK|4.0|I like mahjong and this was a new game for me.  I like tiles that are easy to read.  thanks
0767817664|4.0|Ah, how can you top Rowdy McDowell in the role of Peter Vincent?  And Chris Sarandon  is waaaaaay too  sexy to be  a vampire.<br />The rest of the cast was  good.  There was nothing scary about the movie, it was more of a comedy I think...but it is fun to watch<br />alone...on a dark and stormy night.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I really liked it. I can be in touch with my friends all time. It is easy to handle. I love it.
1608955702|3.0|Excellent book on lighting, both flash and natural. Easy to read and understand instruction and examples.<br /><br />Would get 5 stars except for the inappropriate images.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So,scary it made me scream really loud to wake my parent's up THAT'S HOW SCARY IT REALLY IS !!!!!!!!!!!!! .
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I prefer the previous version of The Weather Channel on my Kindle Fire. It was less 'busy' &amp; the map was easier to use. I'll keep this app, but I won't say it's my favorite.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very inspiring. I loved that it was letters. It made it more personal. It's very relatable and is realistic. I would read this book over and over and still find new things to love.
B00004W221|5.0|What an emotional ride what a great movie I would recommend this to anyone great storyline and wonderful actors such an inspiration enjoyed every minute
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This awesome game is so easy for me to play I beat some of my friends highscores.I had fun playing this game.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Balloons td 5 is a AWESOME GAME! It it's packed with missions towers and tons of maps! This is the best strategy game ever! I totally recommend it!<br /><br />A review by improved gamer
B003SQVI54|5.0|I had never seen season one before, and I am so glad I purchased this.  Instant video library is the best for watching videos.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|The game monkey boxing is very fun! How ever the game play gets boring after the 5 round. If I were to make the next update I would add mini games like  survival mode or arena mode. But the game is worth its money/coins so I recommend it.<br /><br />A review by informed gamer
B004HWT6DO|5.0|Fast Paced clear story of how Facebook became the billion dollar business that it is today. Quite entertaining as well!
B008XG1X18|2.0|You don't get everything that is on the full website. Cannot change board main image or sort your boards. Since the update 3 weeks ago I get kicked off site about every 5 th pin. Frustrating.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game that gets progressively harder with each level.  My biggest complaint is not knowing how to turn off the sound.  I would prefer to play the game on silent, but if one can do that it is not intuitive.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|I was expecting this album to be good, but not THIS good. It's truly a remarkable effort by a legend.
1572816295|5.0|Paulina's deck really is magical.  Her interpretations are a bit different from historical tarot, however, she has stayed very close to original often.  And she does this with her intricate thoughtful artwork.  Love the deck.  Thank you.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The first science fiction book I've read where the hero is 75 years old. The author does a fine job of showing what it might be like to be approaching the end of life and have the chance to begin again.
B008Y78M60|4.0|I liked the movie.  I like movies based on history and this one was very good if you like that kind of thing.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|A great background of the 2008 financial meltdown.  Brings a lot of perspective to how big Wall St. really operates.
0385349947|5.0|The book was thoughtful and inspiring.  After reading it, I bought a copy for the young women in my life who are still facing many of the issues discussed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I hated for this story to end. It is one of those books I hate to return. Hope it is made into a movie.<br /><br />JEANNE
B0091REZMW|3.0|How can I best describe this game? Eh....it passes the time I guess. I've played worse but I have most certainly played better. For a free game, it's alright. I wouldn't pay any money for it.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Great movie had us shaking in our boots. I Would recommend it to any of the scary movie lovers out there..
B005XQLBU4|5.0|amazing game love it cant have a better game I llgot this game free because it was the app of the day and I would have paid for it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like playing escape games so this was really fun. It kept me engaged and wasn't so hard that I kept getting stuck and frustrated. I give it 5 stars. I wasn't expecting it to be very cool since it is a free game but I liked it regardless. Bring on the new levels!
B00386EZJU|5.0|that I don't recognize half the songs from the movie, I need to rewatch it to listen for the music. This is a great CD is you liked the movie you'll like the sound track
1591841216|5.0|Great. Best value for money. I use this item for more than 3 months and I am happy with what i bought.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for a long time. So when I finally started I couldn't stop. Wonderful book well written. I would recommend to any sci-fi junkie.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout's experiments & thoughts on energy are so incredible. She has a way of making a complex idea seem very simple & her book has changed my life. I strongly recommend this book & encourage an open mind because the experiment results are just amazing!
B009AY04A8|4.0|I found the game to be a good, interesting CHALLENGE. I thought the part where you have to find the candles a little difficult. But otherwise fun.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Too bad this was cancelled. Tragic that I can't watch a second season. It is a fantastic season, fun and engaging.
B00DETP4FK|5.0|So I wanted a few weeks to buy this album, mainly to see what people would say about it. The first single, &#34;Feel It All,&#34; didn't resonate with me as much as some of her other songs on her previous albums had. After hearing &#34;Invisible Empire,&#34; however, I knew I had to get the album. And it was completely worth it.<br />KT's personal difficulties from the past year have filtered into this album, but the songs here aren't somber and melancholy, or even bitter and resentful, but they feel like an exploration of growth and moving forward. Though I expected this album to be extremely stripped down and simplified, it is not so to the point where it sounds repetitive and a little &#34;too quiet.&#34; Rather, there are several minimalistic tracks, but there are also tracks like &#34;No Better Shoulder,&#34; which parallels Ingrid Michaelson's &#34;December Baby,&#34; which creates a more produced and developed sound.<br />The biggest standout for me is &#34;Invisible Empire,&#34; which is quite and reflective. The melody is crafted beautifully, and KT's voice filters perfectly over the acoustic guitar and light piano notes. &#34;Old Man Song&#34; has a cute melody to it that is simplistic and somewhat cheery. This is one of the songs that seems to really reflect the &#34;country&#34; sound that KT was aiming for. And &#34;No Better Shoulder&#34; stands out again for it's strongly crafted music, though it can seem a little congested at times.<br />Despite how much the music really stands out and remains beautiful, KT has in no way sacrificed her lyrics, and they remain as intricate and beautiful as ever.<br />Overall, this album was a bold move (if anything because of it's somewhat simple nature) for KT to make, especially because it contrasts so starkly with her last album. This album feels far more reflective, but KT has not made any steps backwards and has only moved forward if anything.
0440246016|5.0|Great book by a great author!!!!  Another wonderful Jack Reacher tale!  Always great fun and a super fast read.<br />Thanks!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I was unaware of this book until I read a review in our local paper.  I downloaded the book and was immediately fascinated by the writers' ideas and knowledge. I bought the hard cover book as well so I can have further discussions with my pastoral father.  Great book to supplement with your Bible. Do it today. Thank you.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Grab this one, you won't be disappointed.<br />A real winner, I would suggest it to all<br />my science fiction friends.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|You just can't go wrong w/The Eagles period and when you get good quality recordings you feel even better.<br />Will buy future purchases from here.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Excellent casting, great script.  A movie you can watch over and over again.  If you like Sci-fi you'll love Stargate
1926667131|5.0|Anybody who has ever really tried to understand how to create what is in your heart and manifest it into the world in a way that flows effortlessly and aligns with your highest ideals and will bring goodness and value into the world must read this book...
B00009W0WM|5.0|Movie critics agree that this classic ranks in the top ten movies of all time. Bogart and Bergman have a chemistry that is central to the appeal of this classic.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I am a huge Rollins fan and especially the sigma series. Once again he has done a great job. I really enjoy the mixture of action and science, and that his books are based on actual events (with little changes). I would highly recommend this book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I came in late to the series, and was delighted to find the first 2seasons on Amazon.  It's a treasure! Love all the history, drama, and of course Maggie Smith is a hoot! ❤❤❤❤❤ Five stars and five hearts
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great replacement.  Excellent price.  Works great with the Kindle keyboard I own.  Would recommend anyone else to purchase the item.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I wish I hadn't loaded this...I can't set my tablet down now.  Brings back the excitement I had for the original missile command...
B0037QM8YA|3.0|it had to much foul language, just to much happened that wasn't really explained well in the movie, and the character didn't say enough to explain her situation.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is fun and entertaining. I took me a little while to get the hang of it. I don't play it that  much as I prefer<br /> Temple Run 2. It can be frustrating so if you don't like starting over and over again then it's not the game for you.
B0057LUI0O|1.0|Spent the money didn't know you needed wifi to watch it, was on the road with a screaming two year old because she wanted to watch it!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The trilogy was great very hot at some points, but I was a little disappointed with the last book. I thought the epilogue would go a little further about the future but instead it had a random portion of Christians childhood then it jumps to the day Christian meets Ana. I was just expecting something more. Some parts of the trilogy series did seem a bit childish just like what the other reviews mentioned, but overall I enjoyed the books.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was heart warming and I actually enjoyed the sex scenes. They were hot but not raunchy. Excited for book two.
1441711163|5.0|A very enjoyable audiobook version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickinson.  The voice for Mr.Scrooge in this audiobook portrays Mr. Scrooges a miserly, sniveling man with a high pitched voice, rather than the brutal and strong Business Man of the George C Scott portrayal in the famous film adaptation.  The somewhat high pitched voice suited this Scrooge better as he was becoming gradually converted much sooner in the Dickens original rather than in the film adaption.  The narration was very smooth and enjoyable to listen to. The contrast between the character voices added greatly to the overall work only Scrooge and some of the other characters are potrayed as having higher voices and the narrators voice is sufficiently deep to be enjoyable to listen too.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this audiobook.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmme it's the best game I have ever played I like it because it's really fun and great for everyone I love subway surfers
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a fun game but it needs more levels. The levels become boring after a while. Please ugrade with more levels
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I enjoyed the writing style and the honesty of the author on what he intend to inform me about. I really can't say I knew anything more about the historical Jesus than what I got from my religious upbringing. I hadn't ever read the New Testament gospels but knew from general knowlege that they did not contain the same content or the same emphasis. This book explain why in a very clear way. I had always thought Paul was the true foundation, not Jesus, of the Christian religion which most of us follow. The author doesn't explain fully how this happened, but happen it did. I truly looked forward to my reading experience with this book. I enjoyed it.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is super fun! The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because there needs to be more ways to win gold coins. I am also unsure how the leaderboard rankings work. No matter though...I can't stop playing.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Simply exquisite! Like any story of life and love and loss, it only becomes better and more cherished, more perfect with each retelling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this game helps you learn to interact with a horse as if it wasn't on a screen... you feed it and train it to do shows and you have to groom,feed it, and you can give it treats! Whoever is the creater of this game I hope to see updates in the future and more virtual animal games like this one.
0547391005|5.0|This book about a male monkey named, \\"George\\" has been around for 70 years, now. I read about \\"Curious George\\" and his adventures when I was young. This book has \\"stood the tested time\\" very well. Although \\"George\\" is a male monkey and I am a female, I enjoyed reading every one of the \\"Curious George\\" books I could get my hands on! I would highly recommend this book for both boys and girls. George has some amazing adventures! I bought this copy to give to  friends who are expecting a little boy next month.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I loved the movie, thought they did a great job of capturing the book a few tweeks here and there, but over all I really liked it.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I saw this performance of the only Scottish opera done by &#34;The Met&#34; last year. I have been looking for it on DVD ever since. Very happy to have found it here.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a really entertaining game for whenever im on the road and traveling. its just a really fun game
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Had a product, and gave it to a friend, order this one and have enjoyed watching/listening to it over and over in the past 10 months.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app. It comes w/ everything you're looking for when it comes to the weather. There are several layers to this app, that helps you pinpoint the answer to whatever question you may have
B000W91RUG|5.0|Gave this to my girlfriend and her daughter for Christmas, it was so appreciated and loved.  Made me the hero, sharing the accolades!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not what I saw coming, catches you off guard and becomes so much more than you anticipated. I loved every second!
B000002J0B|5.0|Listened to the CD over and over again, now need some speakers to do it justice.  Shopping for more music and will use the vendor again.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is not a simple story at all...the author writes with a strong emphasis on his medical training and ponders physical and psychic issues.  That said, I found his story to be very reassuring on the reality I have accepted that heaven is real.  So many who rely on science to,dispel notions of God will doubtless mock this, but the blessings in my life go far beyond &#34;the big bang&#34; and I appreciate a scientific effort that reinforces spiritual sense.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I use this app to transfer photos between my iPhone and my PC. Also, I found that it will transfer photos between my iPhone and my new camera that has internal wireless. This is convenient for sending photo messages from my phone to other people. First, I transfer the photos from my camera to my iPhone, then message or email the photos to family and friends.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun but I am ready for a show and somebody tells me I have to feed my horse I feed it and it does it again!!!!!!! Still awesomely awesome!!!!!!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My grandkids want to watch Shaun every time they come to my house, because I get it on Amazon Prime. Although no words are spoken, the stories are great entertainment, and I watch them with the kids.
1573225517|2.0|I've wanted to read \\"High Fidelity\\" for some time, but never approached it because I'm always wary of books that rise too much hype (see \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", another huge disappointment).<br /><br />Like another reader said, the book is entertaining, but shallow. Maybe it's because I'm well past the age of the characters, but I really had a hard time trying to empathize with them.<br /><br />I'm Italian but spent quite a lot of time in England in the early nineties; the book brought me back to that time and environment that I know quite well, but instead of nostalgia I was overcome with boredom.<br /><br />For some reason, the book sounds essentially very very dated; there are some funny bits (e.g. where the author speaks about the lack of sex education for males) but unfortunately the story is very predictable and the characters are quite stereotyped.<br /><br />I guess the themes of the book ware considered fresh and new at the time it came out: the self-introspection of men, the analysis of relationships between men and women, all delivered in a fun way (a bit like a male version of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\") but it all sounds definitely dated now.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie based from this book yet, but judging from the cast (John Cusack, Jack Black) it must be definitely more interesting than the book itself.
1452101248|5.0|I have already tried a couple of the recipes and they were delicious.  one was the dried tomato stuffed mushrooms for a party that I had.  Everyone loved them.  The other was a salad.  Wonderful flavors!<br />Linda
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|works with youtube, netflix and some of chrome casting. I wish it could have casted anything on my desktop/laptop/ipad/tablet/mobile phone
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love the Hunger Games and this is a good set which includes the dvd and the ultra violet copy.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie. A western before its time. I'd watch it again and again. Pretty violent so little one's beware. I highly recommend this movie
B0094GW6YE|5.0|I ordered this item in fact I love Kiss, it´s my favourite Band in the world and the songs are great.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|They make you review to get extra points. Kind of a rip off but here I am doing it. K.
B0025KVLSI|4.0|This is certainly not the Beatles at their best, but having stated the obvious, it is far better than one would have any right to expect.  The Beatles spent 1964 making a film, writing a sterling soundtrack for that film (which is one of their best recordings), touring the US, touring the world, and, as they did all of this they had precious little time to devote to writing new material.  These days most recording artists can bash out a 50 minute CD in, oh, three years - and they are not under the extreme pressure as the Beatles were during their rather short recording career.  What is astonishing is the fine quality of the eight original songs released here.  Any other group would give their F and G strings and snare drums to come up with anything approaching the wallop produced by this CDs first five songs, one of which, \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" although not an original, boasts a Lennon vocal to rival that heard on either \\"Twist and Shout\\" or \\"Money\\".  The urgency in his singing makes it seem as though his life depends on it.  It is the very definition of joyous.  In short, any CD that has such songs as \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm a Loser,\\" \\"Baby's in Black,\\" \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,\\" \\"I'll Follow the Sun,\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" cannot be considered weak by any yardstick.  They may look done in on,  the cover (though they are smiling broadly enough on the gatefold photo), but there is no sign of malaise in the enthusiasm with which they approach this material.  The lyrics of \\"I'm a Loser\\" are belied by the buoyancy of the music - the same is true for \\"Baby's In Black\\". I only regret the exclusion of \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\" - another Lennon highpoint.
B00007KWI9|3.0|Being a big fan of Rush, I decided that I needed to check out some other so-called prog rock legends from the 70's. I've listened to almost the entire discography of Yes, and I was surprised that, although it's said that their first album is only a foreshadowing of what they'd eventually become, it was surprisingly decent. I was excited to listen to the next several of their albums, thinking that if this one was listenable, the other ones would be mind-blowing.<br /><br />Sadly, this album is better than just about anything they did in the 70's. Sans a few masterpieces like Roundabout, this album actually has a few tunes you can remember after hearing them a couple of times. It wouldn't be until the early 80's that this band stopped making prog-rock noise and started making music again. Genesis was the same way. A decent start in 1969, followed by nearly a decade of excess.<br /><br />So far, it seems that Rush is the only band capable of doing prog rock right.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Simply Sparkling! An excellent season, cannot wait for the next season. I had to buy it as it wasn't streaming free in the US anywhere.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|GPA has masterfully found his way in every woman's heart. This writer is perfectly skilled at grasping the readers' attention from the onset and retaining same till the end of the book. At this point, the end, the reader wants more!!! That's sheer EXCELLENCE, highly sensual yet classy and tasteful. I found no hesitation in awarding 5 Stars! I am Stella Mars and this is my review #TeamGPA <3
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Another Google innovation! Let's see what their competitors can do after seeing this amazing new product from the fine people at Google.com
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Was fun and challenging. Didn't have too much trouble getting to the high 20s but getting into the 30s was extremely challenging. Would highly recommend.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|hard to stop playing, have that nagging need to get to that next level.  must have especially since it was free
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely hands down a fantastic read.  I couldn't put it down. This novel was filled with remarkable characters and was beautifully constructed to piece together an outstanding final product. Easily one of the best books I've read this year!!! I am Hopeful there will be a part 2 because I would love nothing more than to see what life has in-store for these people next!! :-)
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Made me think of my son as he grew up. Now a young man I know he will be moving on.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Really love this cd it has become one of my favorite at this moment.  I listen to it all the time.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I loved the book, but I had a hard time getting back to the pages wher I left off.  It would go to Oprah's comments and then I couldn't return to the part that I was reading.  I never was able to read the whole book.  I had to skip around.  It was very disturbing!  I wished I'd never had Oprah's comments.  I think I'll get the hard copy so I can read the whole book.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|A great read. He tells a good story with a lot of twists. Keeps you wondering how the nasty guy is going create his next escape.
B006JD48NM|5.0|What can I say?  I'm a Formula 1 fan and I can only love anything<br />that has to do with F1.  Enough said!
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|Full disclosure; I grew up with the original,watched every film and I have enjoyed them all to varying degrees.This film seemed contrived almost from the start. I am not a hardcore trekie, but a tip of the hat to all who are. I enjoyed the film for several minutes at the start, but the story just went south very quickly. One example of reaching beyond the stars is where Mr. Abrams shows his love for classic westerns in the fight on top of the boxcars of a moving train. Hold on, I'm sorry, they were fighting on spacecraft and Spock lost his six gun, oops, phaser. Oh well, you saw the film and this is just one example of how we are supposed to be wowed by the special effects to the point that we really don't care about an overall cohesive story. Shame really. There is so much potential waiting for full exploration; without doing harm Mr. Abrams.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Its doctor who, there are really no words that can describe how much i love this series and all of the characters!
B008ODZUN2|1.0|I kept waiting for this movie to crystallize into a message that was useful; but that never happened. I found the woman character to be inconsistent in her behavior.
1897299192|4.0|A humorous array of ordinary domestic problems seem to keep cropping up for the Moomin family as they host their own winter sports fest, hire a maid and try to build a house.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I watched this movie on TV and really liked it.  I bought it so I could watch it whenever I like.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I just needed a simple calculator to help me balance my check book. This one does the job quite well.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|don't know if I'd call it the pinnacle of game design as regards the &quot;click and wait&quot; MMOs but this is certainly the right direction to go in.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I really had to play it a couple times and now I am into the groove, its an action packed song, not one of her slower themes, and I like it. Gaga hits a home run again, not only is she a good pop rock singer, she has depth and real talent writing her own music and creativity that so pop singers have today, she is a true music ARTist.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If anything, this is a series where the screenplay has been very carefully elaborated together with the sequence of scenes in each episode, in contrast to some movies where you can see the alterations done to the plot and the twists and turns in the final half hour. The resulting suspense keeps you glued to the TV.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game is really fun and kills all the extra time in your life that you could spend being productive. Just saying.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It is fine. However, it takes forever to get the crown which is depressing. I bought B (165), and did not receive them Contacted both Amazon and bingo blitz, said they would check and never heard another word. Depressing!!!,
034580709X|5.0|Answered previously unanswered questions about the character -- how he came to be such an emotional train wreck.  Look forward to reading all the translations of Nesbo's work.
1781162646|3.0|Read this at the beach.  Taking a break from \\"Anna Karenina\\" which is decidedly difficult to get through when you have two small kids playing around you and wanting your attention.  The fact that I had recently been reading real literature makes the mediocrity of the King novel more stark.  It's just kind of flat.  I was struck by how many \\"nice\\" characters there were. Still I enjoyed it and got quite wrapped up in the excitement at the end.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B00BJDF8YA|5.0|I usually don't read too much, busy life and not much time. This book I could not put down, I made time :) I loved the fact that in times it had me laughing out loud, on the edge of my seat and guessing what would happen next. There was never a dull moment. I would highly suggest reading this book
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I cant wait to get into this book I saw the author on Rachael Rays show and was sold on the book, my cousin and both got the book and it seems like and easy way to diet and that's encouraging..
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up was a breeze, haven't tried moving it around to different TVs yet, but pretty straightforward.  Really easy to use with my nexus 7 as well.  Definitely worth the price!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I LIKE THIS GAME AND I PLAY IT ON MY HOME PC..ITS FUN  I LIKE THE DIFFERENT SHAPES AND WAYS TO PLAY..
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I wish I could get my $4.99 back. Not sure what all the hype had been about regarding this movie. Bradley Cooper did alright, Jennifer Lawrence was just obnoxious and over the top. Lots of yelling throughout. Was not impressed with the storyline or portrayal of mental illness. Refund, please.
B008MM9630|5.0|Beautiful designs, everything is as if you have stepped back into another world. Thumbs up to the designs of this game!!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|bueno, this game is good. it's just like missile defence. so yeah if you like that game this is the bees knees. if not who cares.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I love that this app actually wakes me up.  With the math problems i am unable to accidentally snooze it. I am very heavy sleeper and have a very difficult time waking up in the morning but with this app I wake up everyday.
B00886XQO0|5.0|These are seriously a great gaming headset, but I don't know if it would be worth the full price.  I bought these for 140, and that's about as much as I would be willing to pay for any accessory to gaming.  That being said, these are far superior over any other headphones I have worn.  The fact that they don't need AAs seems like a logical improvement over other headsets, and the Bluetooth connection to your headset sure makes them easier to rage with without destroying them accidentally. I'm not going to go into great detail, but I just want to say kudos Turtle Beach, these are some fine earmuffs.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My sister and I were addicted from episode 1 season 1.  Great series to enjoy! Many twists and turns in every episode.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|yo this game be loc as hell im like addicted to it i love this is so frickn loc mang its crazy i'd say this is my favorite mobile game
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game, don't know bout the malware reminds me of missile command back in the day. It is slightly addictive.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Its fun for a while but once you get stuck you have to buy coins. The first few levels are also really boring because they are soooo easy.
B00701L5XS|3.0|I really like the huge selection of knots in this app, but the iOS style design is really distracting. I realize write once solutions are attractive to developers who don't have the time to maintain 2 different apps, but there are still ways to make these apps somewhat consistent with design guidelines. The back button is completely out of place on Android. Most annoying is the iOS style hamburger button that doesn't even behave like that button would on iOS.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Such a good series! I can't wait for next season. The show is pretty graphic, but appropriately so. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this show.
B006P4FBUE|3.0|Maybe my tablet is to small, 7 inch, The sound is great and I play multiple tones also.<br />Ok for some distractione when you'r on the run.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game requires a sharp eye. I found it to be a lot of fun and a great time killer. I would recommend .this game to all who like search type puzzles.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|love the preview, after watch the movie it is not as good as the preview, disappointed and I even fall asleep in between the movie.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a nice clean game for anyone. Very addicting. Time goes by fast when you are playing it. Just don't like how they try to get you to buy upgrades.
B009AY04A8|1.0|I give this game 1 star because it keeps asking me for a rateing well here you are your app gets 1 star now stop asking me to rate your game
B008JGSM6G|5.0|YES YES YES OH YES GET THIS APP KNOW. OMG THIS IS IT THE ONE APP I GOT ADDICTED TO. THIS APP IS  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|After over year our kindle stopped working.  It simply did not want to power up.  We are not sure what happened.  We thought it was the charger so amazon was kind enough to send us a new USB cable and charger free of charge due to similar reported problems they have had with it.  However, this cable and charger did not resolve the problem.  It is disappointing because I would have expected the kindle to last us longer and I am really not ready to spend more money on a new kindle.  Honestly,  I can really live without it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Rowling's gift for creating real life characters on a page is as evident here as it was in the Harry Potter series. The ending was a little flat, for me, but it was an entertaining read nonetheless.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I Couldn't put it down!! It kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole book!! Must read!!
B004JRVQX0|5.0|It is prettier than old version and holds double the software licenses. I'm glad that it's slimmer as well. appears to be well-made.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game has nice graphics and good flow.  There does seem to be a preponderance of dark themed games and I would enjoy a bit more variety.  Whimsical would be a good contrast or humorous or both. Other than getting tired of similar themes, due to what is available, I enjoyed the game and thought it was well done.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|This book bought out many emotions, especially love and mothering/nurturing feelings. I recommend it to anyone who is not afraid to feel these.
B009AY04A8|4.0|The conversations are long as some have said but there is an option to turn them off so overall I rate this as a good game
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was not gory but it was a deeply disturbing portrait of sociopathy and narcissism.  Creepy and it kept you in suspense with plenty of twists and turns
B005XQLBU4|4.0|F<br />Good game until the ads pop up would have given it a 5 star rating easy to play my son loves it
0143122916|5.0|This is one of the most compelling books I have ever read and his story of survival seems almost impossible. This book is an example that truth indeed is far better than fiction. This book gives you a different lens to look thru and view life a little differently than how you view your own.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|After I installed it and looked at it, I deleted it within 5 minutes - seemed like it was phishing.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|It doesn't show rain totals over the past day, week etc.  It only shows how much it is raining at the precise moment.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I actually enjoyed this even though I don't care for Jeremy Renner. He is not 5'10 more like 5'5 with his Tom Cruise boots. If you can look past the Rambo hobbit, the special effects and weapons are a good time.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|The reconditioning of the old Star Trek give just enough newness to  make you forget it is an oldie.  Although I have seen them before, I had forgotten most of them.  I was surprise at how much I have really enjoyed watching them again.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I watched 9 episodes in 2 nights while I was waiting on my cable to get hooked up in my new house.  Can't get enough of SAMCRO.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Perfect app to play on your tablet. Game is challenging but entertaining.  Fun for hours.  A new twist on the nostalgic missle attack game.
B006UUK612|5.0|This movie is one of my two favorite movies of all time.  It is a good family movie.  This movie puts your imagination to work, has laughs and tender moments.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|A big leap from a previous AMD single core...games are bursting..will work on the GPU next...<br /><br />Zalman Z5 Plus ATX Mid-Tower<br />MSI Z77A-G45 Intel 7 Series Motherboard<br />Intel Core BX80637I53470 i5-3470 Processor<br />(2) Centon BB1333PC4096.01 4GB Desktop Memory Module<br />Seagate ST500DM002 Barracuda<br />LG 24X DVD Burner<br />Kingwin ABT-750MM Maximum Series ATX Power Supply<br />Win7 Pro 64-bit OEM<br />(used) ATI Radeon HD4770
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I think it is awesome because it keeps you side track and don't think about eating or watch tv all the time and  you play 24/7
B005R32L66|4.0|It wont let me sign in with my normal ID cause it says it is linked to another account so I had to make a new ID...<br />I am not happy about that.. We should be able to sign in with any account..
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you are a fan of Minecraft, I guarantee you'll love Minecraft Pocket Edition (( MCPE )). With the new update, they added a moving background, as well as yellow splash text so that it feels just like MCPC. Also, double chests + chest animation have been added, along with smooth lighting, Realms (( Wireless Multiplayer )), beautiful skies, and multiple bug fixes. It's definitely on its way to becoming more like MCPC. o u o
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time my mom thretans to take it away from me love these guy
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Really increased the sound & quality of the volume on my kindle fire. I would recommend this app to everyone
B00632HWOG|3.0|I do not care for yahoo mail because it has poor spam filter, when compared to other other email message centers.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We have watched the first season of House of Cards from Netflix using Chromecast. No problems encountered either with Netflix or YouTube. I have also displayed static web pages and they are rendered perfectly well. If I cast Hulu videos via Chrome browser, the video can be jaggy.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Oblivion is a sci-fi that makes you think with a twist that you wont expect.  I watched the last 3rd of the movie twice!  Loved the twist.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn was an awesome action/mystery writer. We lost a great talent when he died at such a young age.
B008JFUN50|3.0|What's good: Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, of course. Neither one could hit a wrong note if they had a week to practice.  And, if actors are anything like human beings, the best bring the rest up to their level. Not meaning to give co-stars less than their due, I'm sure it happened here. Add in a dramatic script with all the right elements (evil uber-class, downtrodden masses, underground movement poised to strike) and it just gets better. Then pour buckets of money into effects. You're going to see something good come out of the pipeline, and this time you surely do. Action, underdogs become overlords, and gross social inequality undone. Pass the popcorn and it's all good.<br /><br />What's not: Well, plausibility. The minute overclass living on the backs of vast numbers of serfs - well, it's been true, or has acquired enough truthiness to pass casual inspection. Then those guys wearing the conspicuous super-suits. C'mon, didn't anyone think that someone tricked out that way might warrant extra confinemnent? No? OK, you're  a scriptwriter. And all the economics of granting the whole world every advance that modern medicine (their modern) can offer? Well, have a chat with Malthus before you nail down your conclusions.<br /><br />So, apply your depth gauge. The first few inches in, it's magnificent, well-played, the kind that pulls you in and keeps you there. Don't go past the first few inches, though - you won't find much. It's good entertainment, but just entertainment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I bought this for my wife, and she not only raved about it,<br />she wants to know more about Bob and his human!
1476734941|4.0|Besides being easy to understand and follow without lots of messing around. It actually works to lose weight and improve my health and energy.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game to take up a bit of time.  I enjoyed playing it.  Simple and easy to use.. Especially if it is free
B000IDEORY|5.0|Always enjoy this movie, when watching it,always feel like it's a new watch....<br />Glad I finally own it...thank you Amazon... he by;-)
1451648537|5.0|I've given all of Isaacson's works 5-stars. They are consistently thorough, impartial, and exhaustively researched. Jobs is no different.<br /><br />Not being an Apple sycophant, I know very little about Jobs besides his public persona and the rumors that described him as a hard-driving boss. Kudos to Jobs for allowing Isaacson to write his biography without requiring that he proof it.<br /><br />Isaacson details what sounds like a neurotic, self-centered genius. I suppose it's the genius aspect that keeps the public from perceiving him as just another insufferable ego maniac. Even the details of his early life -- not showering and barefoot -- scream f-you. What's interesting is how this manipulative personality disorder (if that's what it is; or is a-hole a disorder?) contributed to tremendous creativity and originality rather than self-centered degradation.<br /><br />Furthermore, the early Zen training is reminiscent of students that develop exceptional personal power before gaining self-understanding. He used it to push employees beyond their limits and, in many cases, to great success and growth. However, it seems apparent that everything he did had a self-serving attachment. It seemed, quite frequently, that he said or did whatever was needed to serve Steve Jobs. At some point I experienced a perverse sense of envy of his ability to not care what anybody thinks. While there is something admirable about living outside the influence of others' love and hate, when it's coupled with an insatiable desire to achieve and a lack (or in some case non-existent) sense of empathy, others will be needlessly hurt. Steve Jobs didn't seem to be bothered by the messiness he left behind.<br /><br />All in all, a fascinating portrayal of one of the icons of the computer era. One not to forget.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and addicting. So far no in-game purchases. Worth trying if you like this format of game. Not bad for free.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Loved it even more the 2nd time! Great date night with my husband. Funny, moving, and very clever-great twist at the end.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|The movie was entertaining but a little too boring at the second half. The acting was great and photography was spectacular. Effects were amazing and something surreal. The story needed more work.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I like the concept of it, but it froze up the first time I used it. Keep working on it. I am using it on a kindle fire hd.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|I liked the acting but the script needed work. I enjoyed better the first two installments.<br />It didn't go smoothly and catchy the way that I have experienced before.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|Even though this movie was great, The 3d effect was not good that great, Its not worth the extra bucks. If the 3d effect was better I would of gave it 5 stars. Anyways on to the movie! The movie was great it had everything an action packed movie should have. They had it all explosions, big guns, tanks, amazing technology gadgets, ninjas/karate, The Rock and even an unexpected death.  I wont say who, you'll just have to watch it. I recommend this movie to all who love action packed movies. There is no nudity so kids should be able to watch it, if granted by parents.
0767919408|5.0|For those readers who know Bill Bryson for his humorous writing, \\"One Summer\\" will be a bit of a surprise. There are certainly some funny lines but Byrson is more convinced of offering a snapshot on American life in the summer of 1927 than making readers laugh. Bryson does a solid job of reconstructing those hot months as he looks at Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic, the rise of Al Capone, Babe Ruth's majestic season and the Coolidge administration's response to the flood crisis in Mississippi and Louisiana. While there are certainly places to nitpick (for example, while he is excellent in capturing Herbert Hoover's competence as Commerce secretary, Bryson is a bit too harsh on how he was seen at this time), Bryson has done a remarkable job at recreating a long-vanished but important time in American culture and life. This is a vivid history of a key area and Bryson's style makes it come alive. This is an excellent illustration on how history books can be written for a general audience--and professional historians should take notes. As a member of Amazon's Vine program, I was given a free copy for an honest review.
B005VMSATA|4.0|Family issues a la soap usually don't work so good, think Hulk 2003. Also, when you already have more dramatic and mature approaches at superheroes (Iron Man, Nolan's Batman), trying to &#34;click&#34; with a wider audience usually ends up in less. That's not to say the Green Lantern is a bad movie, it's a fun adventure, great special effects, and entertaining plot. It just doesn't reach the standard; maybe on the sequel (if there's one). Hulk did a lot better in 2008.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Excellent mystery! As with all of Connelly's books, you are in suspense until the end.  Good Book! Maybe I don;t have 3 more words!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the same as temple run but its solo much better yet again yolk if u are a noob and don't no yolk means it means u can ply live once
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Great software. Helps in most of my classes. Calculus and linear algebra courses are a breeze with Wolfram's help. A
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|As i have said before if you were a fan of Boston Legal you will like this series. There is an appropriate mix of banter, humor and strategy. Although at times you are left trying figure out what exactly happened it is for the most part a relatively easy plot line to follow with a few unexpected twists to make it just unpredictable enough to hold your interest.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Arrived, plugged into television and started using our Galaxy MP3 player to watch shows without any problems.  Very pleased with the purchase and use of Chromecast.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an app which I play several times a day. The available settings make it an easy on the eye game and am not yet aware of any \\"I've done this one before\\" starts.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really think it is fun, especially since it is kind of new for me.  I caught on quickly and went through them fast.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|How can you take probably the greatest tv show ever made (the show that died and went to heaven - in reruns) and screw it up.  I mean you are given everything. The people, the ship, the universe, the aliens, the time ---- everthing except originality.<br /><br />Anybody who knows anything about anything knows that Kirk, Spock, and The Enterprise found \\"The S.S. Botany Bay\\" in space in the year 2196 (before the Kirk in the movie is even born).  How do you explain that?<br /><br />\\"The S.S.Botany Bay\\" was a \\"sleeper ship\\" (a ship that carried people in suspended animation indefinitely).  Khan (Khan Noonian Singh) was the leader of a group of geneticallly selected \\"supermen\\" that had survived the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s.  He had ruled a fourth of the earth but was forced to escape into space in the \\"Botany Bay\\".<br /><br />After Kirk and Spock have their little episode with Khan and his 80 (not 72) survivors, Khan, the 80 survivors, and Lieutenant Maria McGivers, a historian on the Enterprise, are banished to Ceti Alpha V where they are just able to exist.<br /><br />Now, enter this movie.  Dah. The movie in no way resembles anything about the original story.  Plus, Khan isn't white, he's golden skinned.<br /><br />There are many other irritating points about the movie that make you wonder if these people who created the movie are taking too many drugs.<br /><br />Spock never had a romance with Uhura.  Vulcans only mate every 7 years at the time of \\"pon far\\".  Inbetween that time, they have absolutely no interest in women at all.<br /><br />Also, did I actually see a tribble?  Wow!  They didn't encounter them until they went to space station K-7 to protect the quadrotriticate grain stored there from Klingons.  That's where we are intoduced to Mudd and his tribbles.  This all happens on the 5 year mission which they don't start on until the end of the movie.<br /><br />You can go on and on, but I think you get the idea.  Klingons that don't look like Klingons and soon.<br /><br />There are a plethora of movies being created by Hollywood nowdays that seem to treat the audiences like complete fools.  Robin Hood, The Three Musketeers and so on.<br /><br />What Hollywood needs is some new good writers that can write good original stories and put them on the screen.
B002POVIMS|5.0|I heard &#34;Bulletproof&#34; several months ago, had it stuck in my head almost constantly, but only recently decided to see what the rest of La Roux's music was like. I absolutely love this album; I have nothing bad to say about it. La Roux has a way of putting her emotions into her music and you can feel them in every song. I was afraid I wouldn't like it because I've heard a lot of people compare it to a lot of 80's music, but it's so much better than that. I can't stop listening to it. She has SUCH a great voice and I can't believe she's not more famous
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I choose this rating because I really liked the book and It made me cry a couple times.  The things I liked about this book were th  two main characters and there feelings towards each other.  The things I did not like we're the romance between the two main characters.  It got boring with the constant kissing but it was still a very good book all around.  I would put this in my top ten favorite books.
1609611543|4.0|Read the book, and started the wheatless diet right away.  After one month, feel wonderful, enjoy making the recipes in the book, and am losing about 2 lbs a week.  All of my lipid panels have improved drastically, and my doctor was very impressed.  Even my blood pressure dropped 30 points.  It takes some inventing on one's menu, but have gotten very creative in making healthier choices without using wheat or sugar.  I feel that maybe I had a sensitivity to wheat and didn't realize it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|No ads yet, so far is pretty fun. Reminds me of the old Atari version. Will update if things change.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Yes, it has a happy after, not sure \\"ever-after,\\" or simply \\"after.\\"<br />Anyway, I have known few similar cases when one has to make decision to stay with a partner or not, which this movie touches briefly.<br />I don't want to give away the story, but it's the first flick I ever watched by choice.<br />Don't know why I did that, but it was OK.<br />The main female character kind of annoyed me, and to me she was narcissistic and too blind by her own pain and pride to see the reality. Well, this is a movie after all.<br />They younger brother was super cool. He made me laugh. Anyway, you will enjoy it--nothing special or gourmet, simple enjoyable snack for your mind if you will.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is really great UNTIL you get to the challenges that require you to pay REAL cash for game cash! This is the ONLY reason I gave it four stars instead of five...
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Loved Spartacus since the day it came out on Starz, and to receive it for such a great price was great.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Nice story telling.  A bit predictable though.  The relationships were well thought out.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love anything that is made by Hayao Miyazaki....I recommend this video it is a great story and the automation is wonderful.  Of course it is loved by children and adults....but mostly it is the older children I find that like it more than the age under five, since they do not know exactly what is going on.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great show!!!! I think the casting was absolutely perfect and the costumes were from an era that i can only dream about. Cannot wait for season 4.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This video was very entertaining,,,,the cast was wonderful and the acting was excellent...I would recommend this video.  I could watch it again and again.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|When I saw this book was getting 5 star average reviews, I thought I would try it. With the exception of Game of Thrones, I don't normally read books from the war/swordsman type genres. This book is fantastic! Fans of Martin's series will enjoy this one too, it's easier to follow since the plot follows one main character, but it is great. Ryan has some serious talent.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Easy read with interesting well developed characters that lead you through the story.  This is not what you might expect with a plot that is unexpected but so believable.  I really enjoyed this book !
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book had me on the edge with every word and could not stop. At first it was for school but then i started to love it. Can't wait for the movie.
B00CJGP116|5.0|This is one of his best CDs. He has put all of his feelings and emotions into this project and his vocals are over the top. Love, love it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|A lot of fun and a good way to waste alot of hours and I would say that it is very addicting
B000EXDS5M|1.0|It started skipping in the middle of the film. It played fine halfway through and then it started skipping and wouldn't finish playing I need to return it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Super awesome game it reminds me of the old Atari middle command I used to play when I was just a wee lad
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I didn't see this movie given how bad the attempt at Judge Dredd was in the '90s. I'm not an expert on the character, but Karl Urban did him justice and I was quite entertained by the movie. I wish they had explored themes involving the negative effects of the Judge's brand of justice, but I didn't walk away unhappy either way. It was a fantastic action flick and I'd watch it again.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|fun way to spend a half hour or so. good graphics, lots of clothes and boxing add ons. The only thing is after 30 minutes or so the boxing becomes very repetitious and all your opponents are basically the same except for different boxing techniques that are easy to figure out. Not a bad game  if you can download for free.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|While watching the film I realized how much I enjoyed the music. I always go to the library and check out the music CD before I buy it, so I can save money and not buy something I won't listen to. After the three week &#34;test&#34;, I knew this CD was a winner. It is great for background music in our home.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great book! The writing is simple and to the point but that's what makes it beautiful. I found myself highlighting a phrase or sentence on almost every page. A lovely allegory for living your life to the fullest, being present where ever you may find yourself, and listening to your heart.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Warm,nice,without being maudlin.  It's a glimpse into a vanished world with which i was not familiar. Great characters and actors.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This is a good ode to the old but yet very well done and nice effects.  If you try to equate this to the original, you are wasting your time.  just watch and enjoy this escapist film.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Was excited initially.  Doesnt stream continously and hopefully Google will comeup with more upgrages to make it successful.  Though HDMI pic quality is not great.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|This is light-hearted horror. Could be a new genre?  Not as funny as S.O. the Dead but not as exciting as 28 Days later.  This is what Hollywood makes when the zombie horror genre is on its' way out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it's so much fun the mini games are so cute and there are so many ponies and buildings so you have to get this app you just have  to.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This is so much wrong in this movie which makes it right.  This is pure action, effects and over-the-top silliness.  You can tell they had fun making this movie and everyone should own it for those dreary days.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Action packed from beginning to end. The producer, directors, writers and casting agents stay true to the original characters. Worth watching again and again.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|I enjoyed this fun little horror film.  Not scary at all and has some gory moments.  There are a few instances where it reminded me of the original but I would have to say this stands on its' own merits.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Big fan of comic book movies. Can't wait to see part two. And yes, most of them are far from following the books themselves, but hey Jack! It's great entertainment just like the books.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I  got this as a free download and is good to pass the time can't wait to open the pipes game. Good game
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I enjoyed this game. Every bit like the classic but better on the touch screen.  I like the options to upgrade your missiles.
1574214276|5.0|I liked everthing about this book. I appreciated the excellent illustrations and information about the process of Zentangle.  I recommend.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loved a local play of the Jungle Book and I wanted him to have the original
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm excited to see how Google adds features to this over time. It's just so easy to use!<br /><br />Way to go Google!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's got incredibly strong writing; intelligent enough for people who analyze everything in entertainment and yet, quirky and fresh enough that you cannot stop watching. Strong male leads, with incredible female actors and enough to keep you on your toes. There are legitimate legal storylines which use common sense answers, but make you think to create the connections. It's seriously good t.v. I was surprised and enjoy the series, though I usually need a much more action based storyline to stay interested.
B007AL48UK|1.0|I wouldn't load and it wouldn't go away (it really would NOT uninstall!). Then the tablet froze up.  When it came back with a reset, the dammed icon was still there.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is really fun. It keeps me busy when I am bored and thinking about things. Would be nice if upgrades didn't cost  so much.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|but I wasn't impressed. the minions are pretty cute, tho.  Lots of noise, very colorful. candy crush is easier to play.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|But challenging...<br /><br />Keeping up with the missiles on a large screen proved it's difficulty, but it was still fun.<br />Would recommend to others.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Please see my review of rotate and roll. I'm serious. A child would find this boring. And its meant for kids.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Nothing really interesting in this game. Content comes to quick and the click seams to be off in the x and y direction.
B007SGM084|4.0|Heard so much about this trilogy I had to read it.  Just wish it continued I could read this story forever.  Recommended it and bought for my sister for her birthday.  Great read.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Coolest game ever man<br />Blow up missiles save<br />City's it's awesome man<br />Woo hoo time to play<br />Missile defense man.
B000002GJH|3.0|First off let me say that I'm assuming in this review that you know who is on this record and the story behind it. Secondly, given the importance of this album and the aura that surrounds it I'm trusting that you'll note that I've given this disc 3 stars and just hit the 'no' button without reading the review. Go on, it's the only respectable response...Now, on with the show...<br /><br />One of the great things about project albums is that they allow the players to indulge their muse (or ego) and do things they may not have done on `proper' albums. And that is a great freedom for artists to have. On this precursor to so much of what went after we get a heck of a lot of stuff that is both beguiling and frustrating. The positives perhaps deserve centre stage to start up with;<br /><br />Firstly despite the sad circumstances that tinged the creation of this album - and I'm not going to bore you with the story for the millionth time - this album comes across very much as a celebration of music. It has a vibe that speaks of optimism and hope for a brighter future. That is worth a lot.<br /><br />Secondly the album scores vibe points for the importance of the musical watershed that was about to occur - the seismic eruption that some of the players here would be central to. It gives this disc an historical significance that provides it with worth out of proportion to the actual content.<br /><br />Thirdly the tunes here sound formative, like these guys were reaching out to see what they could achieve. Sure, a bunch of it is perhaps not their best work. Chunks of it sound like a collection of B-sides. But for fans of their later insanely popular constructs this is probably part of the charm.<br /><br />Lastly production wise some project discs do suffer from being too disjointed. There is enough linear stuff running through the album to keep it hanging together. Also this was a project done before Pro-tools etc where projects could not be phoned in with such consummate ease as nowadays. Real musicians sat around and did this together, not just swapped files with each other via the internet.<br /><br />(Oh and I know I said my previous point was the last one but can I squeeze in the charm of the liner notes as an extra bonus?).<br /><br />Downsides are here and have coloured by rating. As noted above the project feel of this album has meant that some of these songs sound like stuff left over from other sessions or the guys just trying some weird stuff they'd not bother putting on their own albums.

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Would love to endorse Evernote, but the promises of ease of use across devices are just not true. I have been in computers and networking for 20 years and have a doctorate in business but can't get my notes from Kindle to Windows laptop.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|like the game but hate that you have to wait to build up energy... but the special little puzzles &amp; challenges are fun...
B001RCD2DW|4.0|The audio quality of these headphones is incredible when compared to their cost.  They have a very flat band response and dramatic clarity and separation.  When used with a quality headphone amp and DAC, they provide a very nice listening experience.  My only critique would be that the bass response is pretty weak.  This is to be expected for reference or flat response phones, but a little more bass would improve the sound of most modern music genres.  For classical music, they are excellent.
B005LAII80|4.0|I took a chance on a Saturday night to see this at the theatre and was pleasantly surprised.  The movie takes you back to the old fashioned kind of violence that existed in earlier movies, think Robo-Cop, anything featuring Sylvester and Arnold when they were younger, no CGI stuff.  I will say that when I went to see it afterwards, I wish I would've seen it in 3D; the visuals were pretty cool and Lena Headley was pretty bad a@%
B000002UJQ|5.0|Much like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or Nirvana's Nevermind, this album is a work of art that redefined what music is capable of.  While not as big a commercial success as the previously mentioned examples, this album is brilliantly written and produced and will go down in history as one of a few truly great recordings.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have not been able to get it working.<br />It's much more difficult to set up than led to believe.<br />I need to adjust my router and have no idea how to do that.
0765325950|3.0|It is a shame that while I believe Brandon Sanderson was making the story more compelling as a writer than Robert Jordan had, at least for approximately the last 6 books Jordan wrote, this book fell short on wrapping up the story well.  Robert Jordan wove a web that, unfortunately, moved at a snails pace.  Brandon tried, albeit fairly well, to compensate and finish the story quickly, but there was too much that had to be addressed.  This book series should have been, at most, half as long.  The idea that one of the books that Jordan wrote takes place over a single day is ludicrous.  A disproportionate amount of time was spent covering uninteresting or trivial side stories that went nowhere (e.g. Elaine and the Camelyn Black Ajah), whereas relevant sub-plots that cried out for more attention were glossed over (e.g. Padan Fain).  This is regrettable as Brandon did an admirable job trying to correct these problems, but it was too late and Jordan had already indelibly marred has initially interesting creation.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The acting, the plot, pacing,special effects, attention to detail and respect for the original are all top-notch.  The only downside is that it's too heavy one Transformers style action sequences than is necessary.
B004XKVPG6|5.0|Superb performances, somber visual style, and gripping story combine in this well directed movie.  It is hard to go wrong when David Fincher and Brad Pitt work together.  Now, throw Morgan Freeman into the mix, and you have a great movie.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Great game. It's a mind teaser! This game really makes you use your brain. Had a hard time, but I'm getting better. Not an easy task. The game makes you think. Still fun too play.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Love this movie...it was an instrument that introduced me to real Hachi whom I cannot get enough of. This is for you, Hachiko!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm on 0.7.3, it's awesome, cool, good, And best of all monsters come out at NIGHT.<br /><br />  It has a Sun,moon
0345505387|5.0|The Exile is exactly as advertised.  It gave faces and bodies to the characters found in all of the Outlander novels.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I wasn't expecting this game to be very fun but I'm absolutely addicted now! :) More fun with friends, add me: FANLA
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just finished this trilogy for the 3rd time and even though I know what's going to happen it still sends me on an emotional roller coaster. I definitely recommend these books.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|OK.  This is a really good movie.  And Emma Watson is absolutely gorgeous. A little unrealistic in its depiction of high school, but who cares.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Loved the soundtrack from this movie..took me a while to find the CD...great music..even went out and bought a new player for it  :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Took me awhile to read this book, but glad I did. Mr. Grisham's books never fail to entertain, this one is no exception. Enjoyed the various twists to the plot and the narrative by the book's main character, Malcolm Bannister. Recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun game exilent games a lot to do in here I recamend it.so go and play it. come and play it now.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I fell into watching the film, and enjoyed the music so much I had to buy the sound track.  The riff-off and the Bella's final are my favorites.  If you have only heard the original versions of these songs (for example, No Diggity and Since U Been Gone) you are missing out on truly fine a capella performances.  it was astounding to me how well the arrangements worked.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that the regional third place song (performed by Sockapella in the film), was not present on the CD.  You have not heard a Pink song performed this way before, I will wager.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|this was very informative and extremely exciting for me and I am not a pilot. I can't imagine how exciting it would be for a pilot who could imagine and virtually &#34;experience&#34; the situations being described.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Great show, just wish there were more than three episodes per season.  Good actors, AMD nice modernization of the story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Perfect app works great. Easy to use and easy to pin! Does not slow up my computer or Kindle. I use this everyday!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved everything about the book. Ended leaving you wanting more. I can barely wait for the next book to come out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My old Bible has been so worn from reading for years, so I was finally able to download this Bible App for my tablet, and its much easier to take my tablet into church and look up the verses easier and faster. Great app
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|Our favorite ST movie.  The crew getting along in SF 200 years ago is priceless.  Great shots of the whales.  Great story line with the Vulcan Battle Cruiser landing and cloaking in Golden Gate Park. Great interactions among the crew, especially the doc and Spock.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I have kept up with almost every Angry birds App there is, and I finally get to play the Star Wars version. Very fun stuff
B0000046MM|5.0|Paco is always great.  This is an early recording and it is outstanding.  I recommend it for anyone who adores modern flamenco.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Very fast, very funny, especially being a big fan of the Despicable Me movies. Sound effects and actions in the game are always fun
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Great reading, a change from the plethora of thrillers. I found it very hard to put down  once I started reading it.
0061124958|5.0|Beautiful hardcover edition of Charlotte's Web. Even nicer than I expected it to be. I guess there's something different about holding a book in your hands compared to looking at it on a screen. Great value for the money, and of course a classic story with BEAUTIFUL illustrations by Garth Williams.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Love playing this game on my tablet.  Nicer than my other missile game because I can enhance my weapons. Go get it if you haven't already
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book should be taught in school. It covers so much of human psychology it is crazy that it wasn't even intended to be written until the author realized he could not write his original story without first writing this one. This book is a discussion on human fear, fear of the unknown and the unknowable and the consequence of that fear. I did not read this book when I was a kid. I was an adult when I read this book for the first time and my only regret was that I did not read it years earlier.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|We've loved the new Star Trek movies and it was the logical thing to get a digital copy we can take anywhere with us.
B004HYDM0A|5.0|Spoiled because I've seen the tv shows.  But wanted to see what started it all and was not disappointed.  Unbelievable story, and to hear three definition of catfish from Angela s husband at three end was powerful in this wierd sort of way
B007V2UGPE|5.0|One of the best apps you'll ever play. There is little to no issues with gameplay and upgrades. Totally worth the money.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I know that the purists argue about the change of color of this version and I understand their point but the quality of the movie is still really good. For me Pinocchio is the best animated feature movie ever made which is why I still give it the full 5 stars. If you're not that concerned of a slight change of colors(which I personally wouldn't have noticed) you can enjoy the fantastic animation and most importantly, the superb storytelling.<br />This is movie making at it's best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is awesome and very very fun game to play. I am having fun playing it even my little boy loves to play it. so l would tell you that you would love it
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD.<br />It was better than I expected it to be.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the different themes and characters totally recommend it for anybody who likes the movie or who likes running games
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I've had this item for a couple of weeks now...it makes my work area much more comfortable & clutter-free.<br />Also, it gives me the ability to raise my monitor to the correct hieght & position so I'm not straining my neck & eyes<br />all day. It took about a half an hour to to set up...but came with all of the correct parts for a Dell monitor.<br />Although it's rated for up to only a 22&#34; monitor...it works very well with my 24&#34;
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Good story line. Great tie-in to the old school Trek movies. I look forward to seeing where they take it from here.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really a challenging brain teasing game Had me making notes and racing against a friend to get to the next floor
B003ASLJK4|5.0|What a wonderful love story  and this is the way  people lived years ago.  You marry for life and then she realized that there was a better  life out there.  I bought the disk for friends and family to see.  Just wonder how many men and women  have gone through this?
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Excellent.  Good follow up for the previous one.  Waiting for the next one to see what's new in S. Stallone's venture.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|great to read it again, just as good the first time round, love that it is in kindle form for ease of portability, now to purchase the next one
B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl is a genius! If you love what music awakens within your soul then this is a must see! Countless creative minds honing their craft!
1780387105|5.0|This songbook is easy to read and understand. Content is presented in clear and concise way. The content starts from very easy strumming and ends up to more complex songs. The songbook is absolutely wonderful for the beginning guitarist and contains a challenge to learn for quite a while.<br /><br />What makes this book even better is that a lot of the songs have additional youtube videos having pointers on how to play the songs.<br /><br />In my opinion this songbook is essential for anyone who is starting to learn playing guitar.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I was intrigued by the current hype surrounding this writer and his subject. After purchasing the book, I found it to be a well-written and accessible overview of the life and death of the historical Jesus and the early growth of what would eventually become the Christian church. Aslan handily explains away many of what he considers to be grounds for the myths about Jesus of Nazareth's life, and left me wanting to read more. This is not going to be appreciated by the devoted Christian, but should be certainly interesting and thought-provoking for those looking for more insight to the \\"greatest story ever told.\\"
B0042TV4IW|5.0|For those who enjoy Downton Abbey this is worth the watch. Where Downton is focused on the Aristocrat this is a story of the pleasant in the Hamlet and the nearby village. It is a nice story of the trails and tribulations of being poor in monetary items but rich in love and community. When every day things are tough you band together to help one another. This pre-Downton Abbey series is a great story to watch now! Enjoy!!  Be sure to watch the entire 4 Season series!
B003B02PEU|5.0|Excellent reading that kept you wondering and trying to figure out the possibilities.  It was a great read that you won't want to put down
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Tons of must read moments in this book.  If you loved the first two you must read this one too. I truly enjoyed it.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I recently bought a notebook for travel, got sick of lugging a heavy laptop around.  It has very few USB ports but it does have on USB 3 so ordered this add on.  It is great, small size and works with everything I have tried so far.  Too bad you can't use it to charge your phone but that is a minor detail.  Service and price were great.  I will continue to watch for this seller as I need more products.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great graphics esp if you love nemo. Game progress is slowgoing until you acquire pearls although you can buy them. Overall really cute and you can lose hours. I recomend
0307279189|5.0|Great book from A to Z. Intermingle of great information about the science of running, the history of running, the business of running. Introducing great characters of our century that are worth knowing about. By page 30, you already want to put your shoes on and go for a run. Well done!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book brings the reader back to thinking like a child, and lets you experience the wonders and horrors of another world. Great read.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I very  much enjoyed this movie.  So excited to see the sequel now.  I thought it was interesting and paced just right.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Kvothe is so exciting, as are the companions he meets on his journeys. If you like fantasy, read this. If you just like fiction, read this. I finished it in a day, and it was worth the cramped neck and gargling stomach.
B00985E3UG|5.0|An excellent way to reveal how sources of salt, sugar, and fat get to our grocery stores and how the food industry really works in making sure that we keep getting it even though they know it can be harmful to us. We really have to make smart food choices for ourselves and our families. This book can help.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this type of game. I also have rooms and doors but this game is much more enjoyable because there are no intense brain teasing puzzles to solve ( at least I haven't come across any yet). Good game for something to do while unwinding.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got my daughter playing it now she has her husband and now I have my Husband. She called today to say How dare I have her playing a game that only have ten levels. Lol can't wait for more. So I told her about floor escape.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun at first but gets boring really fast. Simple game but repetitive with no real features or unique qualities that make it any different than everything else.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A truly amazing piece of fiction that will transport you through time and imagination! Very cleverly written, leaving you wishing there was more. Miss Morgenstern is a terrific storyteller. Thank you for sharing your genius imagination and immense talent. I'm truly inspired!!!
B002APU580|5.0|Love it! One of my all time favorites! This is a classic love story that shows how the morality between man and women should be respected and cherished.
B00DU74U74|3.0|The book was a lot better than the movie.  I don't think the movie had enough time to develop the characters properly.  I remember being really attached to them and their relationships in the book, but in the movie I could have cared less.  I'm the type that will cry at country music on the radio and I felt nothing.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake is getting better and better with age and just can't seem to write a bad song. I really enjoy all his music.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I've enjoyed all the books. This one really leaves you wanting more. I'm engrossed in the characters and what lies ahead for them all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this thing.  It is so smart, so small, so fast.<br /><br />Setup was quick and easy and I find that I make very regular use of mine every day.  Far more than I thought I would.<br /><br />I can think of so many uses for this device and I am excited to see more and more services added to it.  I'm considering buying a bunch of them as gifts to other people considering how cheap they are.  They more than pay for themselves.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|Remake of an old game. Adds little. Nags lots. In fact it's making me write this review!<br /><br />So yeah there's that.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a great free game that I enjoyed except for the goals were based around facebook. It's fun to be able to come back  to it later when it's made advancements while I w as gone
B00280LYIC|5.0|First I want to thank two of my friends who were the ones who recommended this series. I hesitated for a while before trying it out. The first couple pages and I was hooked. I really love this series and cannot wait to read the next book.<br />  I hope that you enjoy this series as much as I do. If you like this book, I suggest you try out Redwall series and the Warrior series. I wish you good luck for my suggested series.<br />PLEASE NOTE: this review is written by a nine year old.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. It's a great time waster though it's a little frustrating when I run out of Bingo Credits.
B00D2DI342|4.0|Dog man star  meets Trash = Blood spots<br /><br />worth for waiting the real Brit pop . land mark of the 90's  Speechless and Undeniable , Must have !!!
B000005S0D|1.0|If you are a fan of their first 4 cd's forget this one. I wouldn't have known it was Camel if I didn't see their name on the cd. This is a cd you will enjoy if you like 80's synth rock. I will warn you that all the songs sound the same and was totally disappointed with this so called Camel cd.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Just discovered Supernatural in reruns and had to go back and start at the beginning. This is a terrific series. So glad it made it to 9 seasons.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|as soon as I learn how to make it work  I don't have it functional at the present.  jDqmmms mammmms
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Love this series. Miss the humor of the first five seasons in the most recent two. Hope the writers permit some humor in the 9th season. Looking forward to it.
0756666937|4.0|I got this item very quickly. The only thing I didn't like is the book cover that it comes with... It doesn't stay on the book while your looking at it
B00AVL23YE|1.0|I didn't like using it, it seemed an unreliable way to get email on Kindle Fire HD.  I deleted it.
0307408833|5.0|This book has Great and unique recipes with quick delivery. And there are many different types of recipes so this book will keep your busy for a while! I Can't wait to start baking!!!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I like the visual of Justin Timberlake's album.  He is obviously influenced by other great artists, yet makes his talent his own.  The songs he plays are unique and fun.  Upbeat, not any sad songs about loss and sorrow. I have my own personal favorites on the album and I am sure you will too.  You can even listen to parts of it on U-tube before deciding. Or, better yet, find his music on facebook: [...] I'd say I have already listened to it so many times, I got my money's worth and then-some.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Interesting and involved story.  So many facts and places in this one.  Love that it is another testimony of God with our founding fathers leading the way once more.
B009AY04A8|1.0|Thankfully this was free.  No zoom, way to much dialogue, boring.  Probably more geared to the younger players.  Anyway keep your money.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie had some decent action scenes. However I felt the pacing was a bit slow at times. I also believe that some of the other characters had no soul ,no personality ,as if they were put in the film just to die.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Well written with tender moments and believable story line.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.  Keep on writing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Like the old game but better.  Upgrade you arsenal, or hord your points for repairs. Attacks increase in difficulty at a reasonable rate so the games last long enough to be fun.
0345803485|3.0|The most interesting thing about this book is the introduction to BDSM and the D/s lifestyle. I always avoided the entire subject because I thought it was weird and a little frightening, but the *very very light* reference to the emotional issues behind people's desire for such a lifestyle intrigued me and I found myself looking for more information on the subject.
B00E193TM2|5.0|You can start it at track 1 and play to the end and not be disappointed. The cameos are great too. Rob Halford!! Maria Brink!! This band seems to continue to win.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Absolutely loved this book... the author did a superb job of making each character totally relatable.  She meshed the storylines well and the ending was perfect.
B007OV6AT8|5.0|PD James on top of her game! Which means we win. Her Dalgliesh character is a national treasure and her plotting is simply the best.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|It was meant to be used as it says to. I needed to bring the game console to parties where there were more seats and tables than there was empty floor room.<br /><br />I was able to install the thing as explained in the video provided by the manufacturer. Needless to say, the sensor operated very well and still tracked my movements and positioning almost as accurately as without the accessory. The steps in the video also explained how I had to use the sensor with the Zoom accessory on, so I guess the difference between being able to play and using the sensor with a slightly different means of getting it to recognize you was deliberate.<br /><br />More importantly, I have been able to get around the game more without the need to move as much so as not to bump into any people or objects in the small room I had to set up my console in. It's managed to work the first moment I had recieved one of these and set it up.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great cast, each of whom pulls off their respective characters very well. Entertaining story line. Great action sequence. Looking forward to the next one.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I really liked older Black Sabbath and Ozzy stuff, and I was really happy with this one as well. This album has both the classic and newer sounds, and it feels very well integrated to me. These guys are terrific musicians.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a good distraction at the end of the day. Have not had any issues as of yet though am a little concerned after seeing malware in some reviews.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Her writing style goes as far downhill as possible in this book. Very disappointing. I know Katniss is supposed to be 'realistic' in dealing with the trauma of her situation, but after the umpteenth time of a detailed listing of how a certain injury or other hurt her, I was ready to quit. Generally the main character of a story is not unconscious and left out of all the plans 85% of the time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun flash back.  Easy to play.  Like the upgrades you get right away.  Then the enemies have to work back up to you. Missiles away!
B00EF460ME|5.0|I came across this app by accident and I am sure glad I did. It has done a great job in boosting the sound quality of my kindle fire. And not just  for the music. It does a great job with the sound quality of the videos too. It is a great way to improve the sound system on the fire. I highly recommend this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive,just in one hour of playing I beat my friend and got 1 New person.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|Even though some of the things in this book seemed horrific, I couldn't put the book down. I would complain about being told to read because I thought it was a bad book. When I did start reading it, it was hard to stop. Purple Hibiscus is an interesting story that draws you in, and leaves you saying \\"is that really it\\" when the book ends.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Interesting!  This book was different from other books that I have read previously.  It was interesting to me indeed!  Thanks!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Vince again G5 has offered us another game to tickle our fancy and take us on an adventure. I used to despise hidden object games until I discovered G5 Entertainments answer to the boredom. Fantastic storyline stimulating puzzles and entertainment for hours. I'm loving my new favorite hidden objects games just wish I could keep my energy level up longer as I refuse to pay money to keep me going. Good game all in all.
B008M721MS|1.0|Great idea, seems to work on my computer... But doesn't work at all on my Kindle Fire HD. I tried this for about three or four months; people would call and the programming is so poor that it can't even stay loaded to receive calls. Only good to attempt out-bound calls, only stays loaded for a few hours at most before crashing, barely dependable as anything more than an empty claim.<br /><br />It's clearly  a  conspiracy by Microsoft--introduce an app on another operating system (not Microsoft) and use it as a platform to say that Android is unstable--there Are lots of applications that stay loaded dependably,  you just don't know what you're doing
B009RH9J7W|4.0|This met all of my expectations.  The only thing I would change is how the kindle fits in the case.  I would change the openings so the kindle can be set in the stand and charge at the same time.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|&#34;Fiction is truer than fact?&#34;  I think Hemingway said that.  In the case of &#34;Homeland&#34;, probably not?  But who cares?  It's riveting and topical, and Claire Danes and Damian Lewis are brilliant.  They perform with fabulous chemistry.  The rest of the cast is totally in sync!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Pretty good. It could be sturdier and more affordable by now, but overall not bad. My goal was to protect this tablet that my child plays with.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Loved it  - while an updated remake of Star Trek II, it has several unique twists and bodes well for the third movie in the franchise.
B00640UICA|4.0|Great game... my kids love it as well. Wish it came a hint wen u get stuck. Keep up great apps
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. Works well. Perfect for Netflix. I purchased one for my bedroom and will probably pick up another as more apps support it.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Very good read.  For a hopeless romantic, the book was the perfect thing.  Can't wait to get the next Stephanie Perkins book!!!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|4.5-5 stars<br /><br />This was a great story. It's the first story I've read by this author but I enjoy her writing style and may try more of her work.<br /><br />Drew is and investment banker. He's a playboy that has a rule to never to screw the same woman twice. He's never been in a relationship and is devoted to his job (and having random sex with women whose names her doesn't bother to remember). I know he sounds like a jerk and he does start out that way. Fortunately for us, he comes around. I liked Drew. His PoV was very interesting. He was funny and, while everything is from his head we do get some added insights here and there. I really enjoyed his inner head chatter, especially as he started changing for the better. When Drew meets Kate for the first time it's at a bar and she turns him down. The next time he meets her he finds he's working with her. This makes things difficult for him since he also has a rule not to screw around with anyone he works with...<br /><br />Kate has just graduated with her MBA and got a job at a prestigious firm. She's engaged to her first boyfriend (he's a musician and TBH he doesn't treat her the way she deserves). When she meets Drew she's attracted to him but determined to keep him as a co-worker. Unfortunately she has to fight him and herself.<br /><br />When things start out with Drew and Kate, it doesn't go smoothly. Kate wont let Drew get anywhere with her sexually but he's determined. His plans of seduction get somewhat derailed when his boss (who is also his father) put him in direct competition with Kate for a new client. Things get a little dirty in the competition and he pisses Kate off majorly. In the end, they have to work on the proposal for the client together. The presentation to the client has it's issues but when Drew backs Kate at a crucial moment they start a tentative friendship. They actually start working together (instead of against each other) and getting to know each other better.<br /><br />Drew andKate are doing pretty good in a non-sexual way but the tension is always there and a few kisses are exchanged but Kate still resists Drew. When her fiance breaks up with her, Drew is there for her and ends up getting a chance to get closer to her. Fortunately he doesn't treat her like his other women and throws away his rule book for her. They end up finally getting together and it's fabulous for them both. They spend a wonderful weekend together before Kate's Ex surprises them by trying to get her back. Unfortunately, Drew has a big bout of relationship stupidity and, when he believes Kate's taken her ex back, he says things he doesn't mean and hurts her badly.<br /><br />After this big mess up, Drew stews for a bit and then realizes he'll never be able to get over her...that he's wipped and she owns him completely! He tries to talk to her but she's unwilling to trust him again. Drew goes all out to convince her. I loved it, bringing in Sister B was hilarious and the sky writing was so sweet (and that's not all he did). In the end Drew pulls out the big guns and has a \\"The Notebook\\" moment (Yes, I mean the movie) that is awesome. To hear Drew pour his heart out to Kate was so so sweet. It was so touching that I was literally in tears, trying to wipe them way so I could see the words to continue reading the scene. The ending was wonderful and we're left with a VERY satisfying HEA.<br /><br />This book was great. Being in Drew's head was such an interesting experience. He started out a likable jerk and ends up being a pretty cool guy. Kate was great, she's sweet but strong and her and Drew make a very good couple. I'd recommend this book. Thumbs up! :D
B00CWY76CC|3.0|At the beginning of the game i was lost but i tried n tried until someone helped me to figure it out. I could use a tutorial at the beginning but when u start playing its great. U will get addicted and just keep on going.

B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Excellent concert video!<br />I was actually at this show, and it was incredible!  I've seen people complain that Rob Halford wasn't putting enough into the show, and I disagree.  For someone in his sixties, he rocked like a champ!  One of the coolest parts was when the audience sang &#34;Breaking The Law&#34;.  Everyone was all swept up in the emotion and it was groovy.  Great show, great DVD.

0618918248|5.0|obviously, this book sparks much controversy, so, I will write my review to help you realize what kind of people should buy this book. I think that everyone in the world should read \\"The God Delusion\\" because it has inspired me, however, not everyone will. If you are a devout Christian, I would highly recommend this book to just give you some insight on the opposing side of your beliefs. If you truly are devoted to god, then you should not let the arguments of this book stray you from Christian ideals so there's no loss for you. if you are a borderline Christian who kinda believes in god maybe because you were just raised that way, then definitely get this book; it will convert you to atheism. I advise that if you are that kind of person, that you take that challenge, because it is life changing. If you are a devout atheist like me, then most definitely get this book. it will give you credibility to your beliefs against god and it will enhance your atheist ideals. so, in sum, everyone should just read this book. you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain.
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|Woody Allen's new film, Blue Jasmine, is definitely his best since 2011's Midnight in Paris and arguably his best since Bullets Over Broadway (1994) and Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). Though the film has comic touches, thematically it is a serious character study centered around a woman named Jasmine, a New York socialite whose life has fallen apart and who has been forced by circumstances to move in with her semi-estranged sister, Ginger, who lives in a walk-up apartment in a working-class part of San Francisco.<br /><br />The film begins with Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) on a plane to San Francisco, talking non-stop to an older woman who happened to have the seat next to her. As the scene goes on, we quickly realize that the poor woman has been inadvertently sucked into the situation and is only waiting for her chance to escape, which finally comes at the baggage check-out. Not everyone in the film will be so lucky, particularly Ginger (Sally Hawkins), her sister in San Francisco whom Jasmine is descending upon to stay with until she can get back on her feet. This, we learn, make take some doing as flashbacks reveal that Jasmine's life has recently taken a nasty downward spiral. Her husband, Hal (Alec Baldwin), was a financier who provided the high New York socialite lifestyle that Jasmine always felt was her due. But then the dream life came apart when Hal was arrested for fraud, convicted and ultimately committed suicide in prison, leaving Jasmine with nothing after the government seized all of their assets. And leaving only Ginger as a haven of refuge, albeit a somewhat reluctant haven as Ginger and her then-husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) invested - and lost - all of their money in one of Hal's fraudulent ventures, something that Jasmine steadfastly holds herself blameless for. Also less than thrilled is Ginger's current boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Canavale), who finds Jasmine's sudden arrival interfering with his and Ginger's plans to move in together.<br /><br />In addition to a tight, intricately-woven script, Woody Allen is known for bringing out the best performances in his actors, which is why so many actors will jump at the chance at being in one of his films. And Blue Jasmine is no exception. The cast was well-chosen and the performances resonate, none more so than Cate Blanchett's Jasmine. In a truly Oscar-worthy turn, Blanchett brings out Jasmine's inherent unlikability, the socialite who blocks out anything she doesn't want to know or deal with and regards her own shallow existence as the only one that could possibly have any meaning, while at the same time making us feel sympathy for her in her downfall, not because she earns, let alone deserves it, but simply because she is so utterly blind to the consequences of her own behavior. If there is such a thing as a tragic Greek anti-heroine, Blanchett nails it in this film.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.n addition to a tight, intricately-woven script, Woody Allen is known for bringing out the best performances in his actors, which is why so many actors will jump at the chance at being in one of his films.

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It is a very good match three game, even if you do have to buy the whole game after a few rounds. I really like the rebuilding of the village part I find that unique and something that's not found in other match 3 games. The graphics are beautiful. I hope the second game is as good or maybe better.

0615782043|5.0|I purchased my copy of this book at a book signing.  I'm not a fan of erotic poetry, however I decided that I would try something new.  I am impressed by this book.  You truly can visualize every scene in this book as if you are actually there watching.  I would recommend this book to everyone!  The poems are easy to read, there is a variety of different types of poems, and they keep your attention.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|First, I should explain that after a plain vanilla religious upbringing and a venture into religious politics, I have pretty much lost any interest in the institution of religion.  To me life around me demonstrates that there are forces at work way beyond my knowledge or understanding, but I know enough about the physics, biology, and other scientific dimensions of life that i see no particular need for any supernatural explanations.<br /><br />Moreover, I look at the history of religions and while, yes, they've brought great comfort to those who have no other explanations of the physical world, they also have been a major factor in the world's intolerance and wars.  So, I don't have much use for them.<br /><br />Still, I am interested in history.  When I saw the interview of Dr. Asian by the woman on Fox News, both Dr Asian and his book caught my interest.  She couldn't understand how a Muslim could possibly write a book about the life of Jesus.  He explained that he is a well-trained historian, whose upbringing happens to have been as a Muslim.  This, however, has no influence on his analysis of historical evidence.  She couldn't fathom that.  So, I had to buy the book.<br /><br />Turns out that examining the life of Jesus from a historical point of view is quite fascinating.  Ignore, for the moment, the super-natural aspects of Jesus as interpreted by the centuries of religious promoters.  Also recognize that the &#34;gospels&#34; that purport to tell his story were written over 100 years after his death--and in Greek!  Jesus and the people he knew were mostly quite uneducated, and spoke Aryan.  The more educated Jews (his community) would have spoken Hebrew.<br /><br />But Dr. Asian pointed out several salient features of his history that seem to be true.  First of all, he was crucified.  The Romans only did this to rebels and revolutionaries that were threatening the Roman State.  The two &#34;bandits&#34; crucified with him were not robbers.  They two were threats to the state.  It is clear that at the very least, he was a trouble maker--one of many in those times.  Palestine primarily was inhabited by Jews whose religion centered on a temple in Jerusalem that was run by Priests who had made peace with the Romans, but keeping the citizens under control. But the wealth they controlled and the difference between it and the poverty of the people was the source of great discontent.<br /><br />Jesus could have been part of the 98% movement in 2012.  Then, when he took after the moneychangers who manned the front of the temple and the priests who claimed to be the only ones who could speak directly to God--sounds like the reformation against the Pope, his riches, and his claiming to be that only the priests can speak to God.  (Oh, wait, those were Christian priests!)<br /><br />As for the miracles, in those days, there were a lot of people who did &#34;magic&#34; tricks.  The audience was not very sophisticated.<br /><br />It was the Greek gospel writers and Paul the televangelist that assembled the pieces of the Christian Religious as it is known today.  Any connections with the rebel fighting for poor Palestinians is purely coincidental.<br /><br />Dr. Asian is very careful only to discuss historical evidence to the extent that it is available.  The Gospels are not a very good source of such but there are others that are much more compelling.  He doesn't dispute the gospels and the writings of Paul directly, but he is very effective at putting them into context.eats to the state.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this documentary.  When I saw it was directed by Grohl himself, I figured he wouldn't have the directing chops to pull it off.  The guy's a great drummer, song writer and band leader...he couldn't also be a great director?...could he?  He is.  He does a great job interviewing the different artists.  He humanizes them like a long haired, tattooed Oprah Winfrey, without getting too serious or judgmental. Many of the artists were artists I never really appreciated, but after seeing Grohl's interviews and their stories, I have a new found respect.  This documentary has universal appeal in the sense, if you don't have an album in your top 10 that was recorded there, you either hate music or haven't had enough exposure.  The story is great, the music is great, the treatment is great, and the people come off as just people despite the fact they are huge rock stars...which could have easily been screwed up by Grohl.  It's an honest portrayal of a perfect storm that came together to create some of the best music ever produced, and it was the human factor that drove the ship rather than the board...despite the board being legendary. My only real question is, what do you have up your sleeve next, Grohl?  A magic act in Vegas?  Hip hop dance troop in Harlem? World Series MVP?  I don't know what the dude can't do.  It inspired me to pick up the guitar for the first time in a while.  Great job, Dave.

1424810493|5.0|Came fast and as described by the seller. Fantastic addition to anyone's movie collection and  fans of the original won't be dissapointed. This series is amazing. I don't usually watch vampire or werewolf movies but I remember seeing the first one in Walmart and deciding to give it a chance and havn't regreted it.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The book is very interesting and provides all the scientific data you need to know about this eating plan. Loved it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story really gets you hooked. I couldn't put it down till I finished. A missing wife, a suspicious husband, and intruding detectives. It has so many layers that keep you guessing. Just when you think you figured it out, the story changes direction.<br />I'm not a big spoiler of books or movies so I try not to go into to much detail. I gave this book only four stars because I like the story; I just don't love the way it ended.
B0082Z447U|4.0|Intriguing story with lots of twists and turns. A bit old fashioned in story as well as execution but keep you guessing about many questions until the end. Enjoyed count Fosco, a wonderful villain as well as Marian, a strong female character.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin always seems to make history easy to read, I enjoyed her Lincoln and it's focus on politics and a kind of dessert after completing the 3 volumes of Sandburg's Lincoln. His a much weightier tome, but also at times a page turner
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Wonderfully directed, casted and produced. Very captivating plot and consistent themes woven throughout. Would recommend for all audiences over 12 years.
B000SW16NU|4.0|The flow of the story works beautifully. If not ask to turn in the most demanding performances, Orlando Bloom and Eva Green do a perfectly fine job, and are perfectly lovely to watch, as is the rest of the cast. Above all, this is a fascinating evocation of a remote world that is altogether different than one might've imagined—even granting the poetic license the film takes with historical events. I'll return to this film in the future when I need another good, solid adventure rush. I can watch Gladiator only so many times.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Movie looks great and Disc in perfect condition as well as the case. Growing my blu ray collection and love the Disney and Pixar movies!

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the plot and writing in this book. I also enjoyed the ending, except for one thing. At the very end of the book, the author included a &#34;what if&#34; section ... where the characters would be if they'd made different choices. I felt that section really didn't fit with the rest of the novel.<br /><br />However, other than that one thing mentioned above, I really, really enjoyed the characters. There were more than a few times when I thought to myself, &#34;how has the author been reading my mind ... that's exactly what &#34;I&#34; think about things.&#34;<br /><br />Nice job!

B009AY04A8|2.0|The screen doesn't allow for 'zooming'. The first level (1-1?) doesn't give you any idea as to bottle shapes, and they get very lost in the clutter. Level 1-2 *does* give you the shape ofthe objects but none but the very last is 'a cup' and the 'shape' screen is about a fifth of the whole screen and unmovable. These are the first and so, one would assume, the easiest, of the levels and I had a headache after the second.<br /><br />Try again, I can't keep this one.
B005PK57NU|4.0|good story lines; want more from Alicia and Will's desire for each other; Calinda story can be more developed too
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been a fan from the first season and always wonder how they can keep our interest.  They always do.  Sometimes the plot is a bit too much like a soap opera but, when you have nothing to do, it is understandable how things can become more complicated than they should.<br /><br />I continue to support the various struggles of Mary and Matthew, Anna and Bates, Sybil and Branson, Edith, Lord and Lady Grantham and the rest of the house staff. It is such a pleasure!<br /><br />I cannot wait for season four!!!

This is an amazing game, with wonderful graphics. But right now I can't get anything accomplished a d it's frustrating. At one point I even opened the game after an error and found everything gone. Luckily I was able to figure that out as the errors have caused it to recur a few times.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Game asks you to rate it in exchange for points after the first 6 levels or something. Not enough time to decide. But so far, it seems like the game will get real old real fast.

B0000924FG|5.0|I watched this concert years ago on MTV and fell in love with U2 back then. This concert was the ground-breaker for many awesome U2 concerts to come. Even back then, Bono would bring fans on stage to dance with him as he does now. I don't think there is anyone in the music industry that can connect with their fans like U2 can. I think the last person that did that was Elvis. Any U2 fan young or old, this is a must-have!
B005LJITS0|5.0|I have to give 5 stars to amazon and their delivery of rental movies. they are the best in the business.<br /><br /> I hated the movie because it was torn between being a comic book and a serious movie. That just means it was nothing.It was as if two 50 year old New York lawyers were talking about their grandsons excitement over that \\"green flashlight guy\\"\\".  It was written and directed by people who had a massive amount of money and absolutely no imagination.<br /><br />I am completely bored with the reluctant slacker hero and his 16 year old emotional defiance of authority. Get over it already and grow up.<br /><br /> The lead, Ryan something or other was doing his best ben affleck impersonation and came across like the guy who didn't want to sell me fries with my burger because it was 'so hard to get them in the bag'. It's time to start looking for some adult movie stars and let these overgrown little boys move on to McDonalds where they can handle the job.<br /><br />But Amazons delivery skills are the best in the business.

Alex, and Brittany aren't so different even though they are from different worlds.<br /><br />This book has a whole lot of stuff going on in it. You have two star crossed lovers. Then you have the bad boy making about about the \\"good\\" girl. Not only that you have said bad boy in a gang trying to protect his family. So wow, there was a whole lot going on.<br /><br />Here are some things that bothered me about the book:<br /><br />1) The whole book sort of felt rushed at times. I felt like I was missing something when time passed.<br /><br />2) I really didn't like Brittany in the first half of the book. I thought she was kind of selfish, and shallow.<br /><br />So really there wasn't a whole lot I didn't like about the book. There are several things I did like however, Like:<br /><br />1) I loved how Alex, and Brittany are together. They made a perfect couple.<br /><br />2) I also enjoyed how Brittany was afraid of some of Alex's friends but she still stuck for herself. And I loved what she did in the end with Paco. I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin it for you.<br /><br />There's more I liked but I will leave it at that for now. I had a really hard time deciding what the rating should be on this book. I mean the book is good, but I guess I just thought it would be a whole more since I've read so many great reviews about it. I sort of got my hopes up. That said however, I still liked it. And i will be reading the next one in this series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever !!!!! I first got this game and was confused then I started to play I  mire it was da best get this game!:)
B000002INR|5.0|BEST SONGS IN ORDER ARE : I REMEMBER YOU , 18 AND LIFE , YOUTH GONE WILD , SWEET LITTLE SISTER , RATTLESNAKE SHAKE. SEBASHIAN BACH HAS BEST VOICE .THE BAND MAKES AMAZING MUSIC . BUY ON CD .
B009NQZVKG|5.0|My daughter started reading Rollins and convinced me to read him also, and I was immediately hooked.  I have not read novels in YEARS.  Being a very busy teacher, I never felt that I had the time to read, until I began reading his books.  I started with a few of his independent books such as Deep Fathom, Amazonia, Excavation etc, and was immediately hooked.  Then she told me about the Sigma Series- definitely his best work!  It took me a well over a year to read all of them in the series.  It helped when she bought me a Kindle (Rollins went everywhere I went)  ending with The Eye of God. I certainly hope that is not the end of that series. The way in which Rollins weaves history, science and suspense along with a little of the impossible is beyond compare.  And at the end of the book he reveals what is fact and what is fiction, and much of what he reveals will amaze you! Don't read this book first!  Go on and websight that will give you the order of the Sigma Series.  Even though you can read them out of order, I recommend reading them in order. They are even good enough to read a second time as we both did. Enjoy!
B000002IQW|5.0|BEST SONGS ARE IN ORDER : QUICKSAND JESUS , IN A DARKENED ROOM , WASTED TIME , MUDKICKER , THE THREAT , RIOT ACT , LIVIN ON A CHAIN GANG . BEST DISPLAY OF VOCALS. TO THE POINT TO THE EXTREME.

B008MWBY6W|3.0|it fits the camera in nice and snug. there are two zipper compartments on each side, and one in the front.  they are very small.  if you have accessories, this is not the case for you.  i have just enough space to keep the battery charger, and connecting wires.  thats about it.  i have a 3 inch tripod that i like to use.  i have to keep it inside the case with the camera due to no space.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Love this device. Wish I'd remember to use it more in my sleep, but I'm a huge fan. It's fun, it's easy, and the battery seemingly lasts FOREVER. Love that it syncs to WiThings. Only thing that doesn't \\"Work,\\" per se, is that it measures steps - so I might have done a 30 mile bike ride, but at the end of the day, it only says \\"6,500 steps taken.\\" Need a way for RunKeeper etc., to talk to it through WiThings so it knows what else I've done.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|receipt of &#34;do not worry, be happy&#34; elaborated in great detail, based on options, together with examples, theory and explanations.
B00BSO2U1Y|4.0|I came to the conclusion a long time ago that there is NO definitive version of anything. This version of Norma provides a different approach to the material. Personally I love Joan Sutherland in her prime in the title role and Montserrat Caballe except on the ghastly RCA recording she hastily made. I'm not a Maria Callas fan in anything. The technical flaws in her voice, the flatness and then the sharpness and the wide wobble and the histrionics disqualify her from my desert island selections. Cecila Bartoli sings the role well and is reasonably dramatic without slipping into Callas-like excess. True, her voice isn't what it used to be and this version eliminates some of the coloratura that the early Sutherland excells in but Bartoli probably couldn't handle that coloratura anymore, if ever. It's an interesting take on the opera but definitive.....I don't know.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Having this on my Kindle and my phone is the best/worst purchase I have made this summer.  I feel like I have been dragged bodily into another world, and am finding it hard to claw my way back into reality to do stuff I need to do.  Haven't felt this transported by fantasy since reading Ray Bradbury and Tolkien 35 years ago.  Bravo!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is pretty interesting, and so far haven't had to spend any of my own money to continue. So far so good.
0486282112|5.0|I needed this book for a summer assignment in AP Lit. The novel came on time, was very very affordable and came in the mail in good time. The book even had annotations in it already which was great. Overall a great experience and I will use Amazon.com anytime!
B003B02PEU|5.0|I have had the audio book for several years.  It is my favorite John Grisham book so far.  I wanted the book to compare to the audio and was not disappointed.  I'd recommend it to everyone.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|This movie is awesome. I love the first movie and the sequel is just as good as the first and the best thing about 2 is that jim carrey is in it. even though that he has a short role he still makes the film. i'm glad that they kept all the original actors in it. I love colonel stars and stripes jim did a great job at him. I thought that the story was good and that all the actors did a great job. I love how they make it realistic like that's how it would be if real people dressed up and played superhero. I just thought that this movie was awesome. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing this game for years and have always loved it. I really enjoy that they have put in more game rooms and more power ups. I can also play it on my kindle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you enjoy browsing Pinterest, you'll love this app! It's a fun way to pass time when I'm waiting at the doctor's office or in line somewhere.
B000025RX4|1.0|This 1993 version is absolutely one of the worst sounding \\"remasters\\" I've ever heard! And I've heard TONS of them. STAY AWAY until they either make more of the 2010 remastered editions or finally give us a proper Legacy edition that's done right with all the extras.<br /><br />Seriously, you'll be heartbroken if you buy this expecting a good time. Johnny's seminal works deserve much better treatment than this sorry mess!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one of my family's favorite children's movies. Even my mother (who hates most movies like this) loves it!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Every time I read a novel by Ken Follett, I feel like I am living in that time with all the rest of the characters.  It is so thoroughly researched and his creative mind brings the story to life in such a way that I am drawn into it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Every corner and emotion she went through was described so perfectly that I almost felt I was feeling the same things too. I just love this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show! Love it! The scenery, characters, and history are all authentic and very entertaining. I highly recommend this show.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Good story, but given the story line not sure it needed the extra darkness of death as the narrator. I don't think that added anything to the story.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Great movie with a refreshing message. Sometimes you just need to see a show that doesn't have all the negative stuff.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Read it, it will be good for you and beats a lot moaning, woe is me and negativiy.  I believe and you should too!!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I'm not sure I'd read it again. It gets a little difficult to relate to some of the characters because you spend so little time with any particular one. I did enjoy the idea of putting millions of zombies on the earth to deal with the elements, seasons, and terrain. If you are into zombies and fancy the idea of putting them into a realistic world, than I think you would enjoy this book.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Thought I was down loading the game Candy Crush Saga.  When down loaded it was Candy Crush Levels Help Guide.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Not a hardcore intense fan but certainly familiar.  Did enjoy the take on khan.  Although the story felt flat ala iron man 2..  And any sophomore effort by JJ Abrams.  But all in all a must see for afficianados.
B000XUUQQK|5.0|I'm watching it at this very moment. So,far it's everything I expected.Because,now I can watch BoogeyMan 3 afterwards .Because,I have the whole collection !
1400031567|5.0|This is a great story and the translation is excellent. I happen to like the related series I've watched on TV. I truly am impressed by the quality of the translation and editing.
1452126607|5.0|I love this, I waited a bit of time for it but it was worth it. This will definitely help me start out my day grumpy!
B004UID2LC|1.0|YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE VIDEO AND THEN WHAT IS THE POINT GETTING THE APP WERE I CAN GET ONE WERE I JUST PRESS IT AND I DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE FREEKING THING p.s. IT CALLED A VIRUS
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Like the video game version fast and fun to play,keeps your attention with the pace it sets,I have enjoyed playing it
B009BJAPLK|5.0|The most entertaining show I've watched this year. Great first season that left me wanting more. Couldnt wait to find out how the second season would start.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|I'm a huge scary movie fan, so when I saw the trailer for this movie & heard all the hype, I was so excited. My dad & I (both being scary movie fans) went. He had seen the original, I hadn't, but we both agreed that this one was awful. Over the top gore, terrible plot, & an absurd ending made this movie one of the worst I've ever seen. So disgusting that I almost threw up in the theater, & I can sit through all 7 Saw movies with no problem. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song could stand along with all the great pop songs from her first album The Fame. The second album was not as catchy or fun. You can keep Katy Perry.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the movie! I'm buying it and watching the second when it comes out!this movie is unlike any other movie out there!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 6 and 9 year old teamed up to solve the first 10 levels.  It was fun to see them get the 'aha!' moment when they figured out what to do to get to the next level.  Fun and addicting!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love the silliness of this game. I love it, too. How are your doing today? You'd be better if you were playing minion rush.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|very enjoyable. watched the entire season in a couple of settings. thanks for listing, waiting for season 4 to be available.
B002ZG981E|4.0|To consider the great Descartian question: whether we are dreaming or being deceived by a demon who is putting images in us is to consider the threshold this movie presents. And although we brush this question aside most of the time because to think about it is to think about our existence as a mind, body, and perhaps even something more (perhaps a soul?), this movie aims to dig right in and show you what it means to accept 'reality' as it is, and nothing more. It helps to illustrate the futility of answering this question, since it really matters not whether we are dreaming- and adopting an empirical Humean concept of experience- what matters is what we're experiencing while we are experiencing it, and this second question renders the first moot.<br /><br />The movie itself is quite good, thrilling, and entertaining, well worth the price and a second and third watch (in fact, many of friends 'required' multiple viewings to understand these concepts fully), and I was hard pressed to spend this much on the bluray, but again, I am glad I did since it is a solid movie, and a good add to any collection.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun, great graphics. Love the monions!! Scrolls smoothly, fun power-ups. More minions, power to the minions!! Get it you won't regret it.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Easy to read and digest case prep manual. Clear concise conversational style helps navigate the important points better.  Highly recommended!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love it because I can always find what I want.<br />It is fast and easy and leaves me time for other things.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is exactly what I needed. Although I already have a PS3 and Xbox for Netflix/Hulu, its great to be able to plug this tool in anywhere, and stream Netflix, and especially stream the tabs from my Laptop. It works perfectly and I haven't had any problems with it yet. It works great with my iPad and my Galaxy S4. Hopefully more apps are released soon, especially apps like the soon-to-be-released app from the android developer that allows you to stream dropbox videos. Can't wait for the future of this device!
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This product would be a waste of time if it were free.  the list of stations that are available is very limited.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this revamp of classic missle defence! I hope I do not play through the whole game in one night...
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I was able to get a little bit of everything out of this movie.  Overall it was great to watch.  The acting was superb.  I don't think I cried this much in a while. :-)
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The book started out great! But as it went along it introduced so many characters that it became hard to care for them. Some of these characters were very peripheral to the story, and although their story was interesting enough on its own, I kept wondering how they relate to the main characters. Take the drug lord, the Greek doctor, the two afgan cousins living in the US - their stories stopped abruptly just when you started caring about them. The only reason I actually finished the book is because he's such a compelling writer and I kept hoping the book would tie its loose ends, but it never really did...
B00E193TM2|5.0|I've liked 5FDP since they first started becoming popular. I have all the albums and would gladly recommend it to all metal listeners out there.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Love it!  Someone mentioned this film to me in passing.  I decided to purchase it, and am very, very happy.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This is a very good story with a lot of twists that are unexpected.  Well written with a different take on amnesia.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a good book and i loved it hvhgjg j rd yr  ff f d  det r r h
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I really think this book is a great read for anyone--parents, grandparents, caretakers, educators, managers, employees, college students, etc. It is great for introverts, and it is also good for extroverts who may not really understand introverts.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|man this game takes me back to my childhood in the big arcades playing missile defender hours on bed, made it interesting withe the trackball too. This game is really good and adds a little bit more to the game of old.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was entertaining, gripping and truly highlights the beauty of having a father actively involved in his children's lives. I am a<br />mental health clinician who works with juvenile delinquents and I wish that every father would watch this movie. Even for those who do not<br />believe in God, the research literature strongly supports the role of fathers in a child's life, in that children without fathers have higher rates of incarceration, mental illness, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, lower levels of education achievement and a are more likely to live in poverty. For those who say, \\"I grew up without a father, and I am fine.\\" That is truly magnificent, however unfortunately you are only an n of 1 and you cannot generalize your good fortune to all fatherless children in the country. It is rare to find a movie that entertains as well as educates. Well done.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|This is a must have for any CSN&Y fan. Stephen is a gift from God. Incredible songwriter and musician. Too bad it was not pressed on vinyl.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Though reviews were tough on this film at the box office, I don't believe critics gave enough justice to the work and efforts that were put into the film. it was an enjoyable movie, shot very well with 3d effects. The public was being presented with an unfamiliar  territory surrounding John Carter and the Director simply tried too hard to explain everything in one movie. It is a very good Sat/Sun afternoon movie and the critics completely missed this one, altogether
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Expected with a second book in a series about a great love. The great love is tested...lost for a moment.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|My grandkids do a lot better at playing this game than I do, but that's not really much of a surprise!!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|These were delivered on a timely basis and in good shape.  The actual size of the Legos was a surprise as the Legos are very small having 480 pieces of the small Legos.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Too much action from start to finish. I liked all of the Die Hard movies more than this one.. Anything with Bruce Willis in it is great. Action  and humor.  This wasn't my favorite. If you love classic Bruce try Reds and Reds 2, awesome!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have not yet completed many levels, but I will keep on going.  Mahjong keeps you alert.  It is not easy, but keeps you interested.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Nile Rodgers from chic fame along with pharrell  and daft punk make for a super song!!!! all around an incredible song showcasing great artists!!!!!
015603008X|4.0|It was a great book, which followed a mentally challenged man who decided to take the risk of surgery for education. He learns that what he always thought  might not be true.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very nice game. I used to play the vintage version of this game when I was a kid. I hope they come up with some nice graphics updates
B00D3NSDVO|3.0|The book is very thrilling, but sometimes it feels like author looses logic and timing, which is disturbing and annoying.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I download this to free some space since kindle is notorious for eating up you space with stuff that I don't want.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|A long long film with too much content focusing on shouting politicians and the very slowly developing march toward vote on the slavery amendment.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is the best quality bag I have ever bought. Nothing negative to say. Amazon's shipping is fast. Would recommend anyone who needs a bag for a DSLR camera to buy it.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|Freddie Highmore gave this role an innocence that was demanded of the character.  And he was the perfect &#34;Oliver Twist&#34; to Robin Williams' &#34;Fagan&#34;.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved reading Gone Girl while on summer vacation this year. It was very interesting and kept me on my toes!
B0038P59A0|2.0|Began to watch this film from Kindle to flat screen as always.  For some reason kept shutting down until I simply gave up.  Looked interesting, though, from the short amount that I saw.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It keeps  you entertained and it doesn't get boring! I would recommend this book to an 8th grader! Fantastic job Suzanne Collins!!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I am a beautiful person who is the best of luck to you by the way to the freeway the same time as a result of the most important thing is new new York times with the same time as at the
B00E9ZAT4Y|5.0|Save your tuppence for this best of all Disney live action films is finally on Blu Ray! You'll clearly hear Admiral Booms cannon shots and watch him battle the Hottentots he thinks are attacking. And you'll be able to see something amazing thanks to digital clarity. Every actor with a speaking role has blue eyes. Hopefully you'll have enough left over to \\"Feed the Birds\\" which was Walt Disney's favourite song. All of the Sherman Brothers great songs and music are here. You and our children will have untold hours of fun watching this greatest of all Disney films. I can't count ho many times I've seen this film though it's fr less than \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" naturally.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love Guess The Emoji! It's so fun and it makes me think a lot. I recommend this game to everyone who loves to guess and think.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book from start to finish! It made me laugh , cry and  smile. John Green is an extraordinary writer.
140006922X|3.0|I'm intrigued by the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth, not from any religious perspective but more to discover more about Jesus the man, and the era in which he lived. This interesting novel by Reza Aslan goes some way to bring the man to life in a realistic way, which has nothing to do with the biblical version, but has lots to do with the history and unpredictability of life two thousand years ago.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Jesus was a passionate and focused activist, by the very nature of the time in which he lived, he needed to be both purposeful and decisive, and I think that this book goes some way to explain some of the rationale behind his actions. However, even after finishing this novel, my image of Jesus the Nazarene remains one of a peaceful and enlightened saviour and though I am interested to have read Reza Aslan's interpretation, my personal image of the man Jesus remains unchanged.
B00E7SID9G|3.0|The writer is a theologian who has drawn on the writings of a number of theologians who have helped him to see Jesus in a different light from traditionally accepted understandings of the life of Jesus - more as a Jewish zealot, more of a peasant than the New Testament portrays him, and who ultimately fails in his mission to establish the kingdom of God in Palestine.<br />The NT as a totally reliable source of the knowledge of Jesus is weighed against other writers of the era, who Aslan relies on at the Bible's expense.<br />The book ends abruptly, noting the apparent failure of the mission of Jesus to his people, and the substitution of another Christianity by the Gentiles based on an unreal interpretation by the Biblical writers of the life of Jesus and of their unreal regard of him as deity. In so doing he takes no account of the difference Christ has made and continues to make both in society and in individual lives when people have embraced the Scriptures as they are written.<br />.
141694737X|3.0|I'm not sure what age children this book is actually suitable for.  The liftable flaps are really thin -- basically heavy, glossy paper stock, and my mild-mannered 9-month old has just wanted to rip the flaps off ever since I introduced him to this book 3 months ago.  If you're expecting a &#34;board book&#34;-type construction, you'll be disappointed.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|A great movie with lots of jokes and a great cast. I highly recommend this video. It's nice to see something this inventive not based on a comic book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is known by all as one that you will quickly become addicted to.  I love it, but I hate losing.  I just wish I could win one every now and then.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best television shows to come out in quite some time.  I can't wait to see the next episode.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire, and it works great!  It's loud enough also, and you can set it for music, too.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This evocative novel begins with the narrator returning to a farmhouse near his childhood home.  Compelled there, he sits on a bench near a pond that his friend Lettie called her ocean.  What happens next is a magical remembrance of events that paint a gray haze over the black and white line between reality and fantasy.  The events that transpire within the haze are so vivid, forcing us to remember the magic of childhood... the things that existed beyond our understanding as adults.<br /><br />Whether you read this as literary fiction, fantasy, or fairy tale... read it.  It's a sad, frightening, and magical journey that forces you not to suspend reality but to question it.<br /><br />Thank You Neil for writing such a wonderful work.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|This game looks very simple to start with, but as you go on, you realize that you have to think of stratagy as well as keep track of your goals.  I love that when you complete a level, the characters applaud for you and fireworks go off.  Very positive.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|Love it.  I just wish they lasted longer.  But I do a lot of printing.  So there you have it!  :)
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|David (Sudekis) is a drug dealer who is in deep hock to his weasly supplier (Helms). In order to make up his debt, he has to travel to Mexico, pick up a \\"smidgen\\" of product, and bring it back across the border in one of the biggest RVs ever to roll of the factory line. Fearing his scuzzy appearance will be an immediate tip-off to border control and DEA, David enlists the help of a stripper neighbor (Aniston), a street urchin, and the downstairs loser kid whose mother (apparently) has abandoned him to make it look as if they are just a harmless, clean-cut, \\"aw shucks\\" type family, thus throwing the scent away from their scurrilous deeds.<br /><br />If you think you can guess how it all ends up, you almost certainly can. The movie doesn't really try anything all that new when it comes to how these kinds of stories frame their arcs. In spite of its predictability, though, the film is legitimately funny. It plows through the standard conflicts and resolutions with the help of some really gung-ho performances and solidly delivered comedic punches, especially with the Sudekis/Aniston duo, both of whom do a stellar job. They're surrounded by more than a few tested talents (Offerman, Marino, Lennon, Hahn, etc.) who all play their characters nearly flawlessly.<br /><br />A sort of anti-family family comedy, this film is full of raunch, sex, violence, and even a bit of graphic nudity, but it never really crosses the line. There are moments when it feels almost like it should have, but it's not out to do anything other than entertain (hence, for instance, the incredibly gratuitous, completely unnecessary, fairly senseless stripping scene halfway through the film, only there to showcase just how fit Aniston remains at her 40+ years of age). And entertain it does, as long as you are prepared for incest jokes (natch), lots of potty humor, and the warm-hearted finale that comedies like these seem required to have. A big part of the charm is that it seems like they had a ton of fun making the film, and that spirit is infectious and catching. The movie's not doing anything all that new, but it's still a lot of fun to watch it do it.n making the film, and that spirit is infectious and catching.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is very fun and I think you will enjoy it I hope you have fun playing
B002NN5F7A|1.0|I would have given this movie a negative 10 stars if that was available. It had every curse word I've ever heard and a bunch of men who were angry losers yelling at each throughout the movie. I asked my husband &#34;Why are we watching this?&#34;
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I must admit, I do like it. it has promise, except as a long time user of dragon story it's going to be hard to get used to the graphics.<br />My only dislike is that it's practically the same thing as dragon story, same things, nearly same dragons, gems, habitats, coins, food, market, even the person who helps you in the beginning. as much as I like it I admit I was p*ssed at first because it was so much like dragon story. and honestly the feeling hasn't left.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is hilarious! It also has great singing!  I'd definitely try it or buy for a fun movie night!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! and is great with facebook!! just wanna say thanks to the people who made this! :)))))))
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The book is written by a woman who from the outside is an upstanding member of society. She made some mistakes early in her adult life and instead of running away or placing blame she accepts her punishment, standing tall, and pays her &#34;debt&#34; to society. Her insight into the amount of people that are tied up in prison because of drug problems was astounding.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Let me tell yall, i have been obsessed with zombies ever since i started watching this on netflix. I had to keep watching. Glad amazon had the new season.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Well above average for this legendary writer. Well worth rereading. Will again. Engrossing, imaginative and a great example of his legendary talent.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just can't put it down. So glad it's available on my kindle fire. I love the graphics but some of the voices are annoying.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch delivers again. A perfect storm of metal and Ivan's clever lyrics. I really liked a couple of the songs had concert friendly versions and then a second rendition with the guest artist featured more extensively.
1609611543|5.0|I have lost weight and feel great. This book coupled with a little weight training and bike riding each week and I have never felt better in my life. Easy too. Takes a bit of early discipline to skip bread everyday, but after a couple weeks I settled in. I highly recommend not only this book but the lifestyle change it advocates. Truly a path to better living, mentally and physically.
B001EBYMB2|4.0|This is the best boot camp sequence in film history and is the most realistic . I recommend that everyone who loves war movies to see this.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Best film i've seen in a long time could watch this type of movie again and again ,last good one was Close encounters of the third kind still waiting for sequel!!!!!!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love it!  Waiting for my family to begin playing but still having a great time with new friends<br />I'm hooked on uno with friends .
B009AY04A8|4.0|I have purchased nearly everyone of these app........That being said.....I do not own this one!  Reason being exactly what I keep reading in other reviews.  TOO MUCH  STORY!!!  Also, at least  so far, not nearly the variety of &quot;puzzles&quot; that I have come to look forward to.  My 4 star rating??? I absolutely love the developer!!  Always a good story , with puzzle games I have come to love.  You can not go wrong with this one for free......Yes there is too much reading &amp; tapping......however the good far outweighs the bad:-)<br /><br />A thought for those with sore tapped out fingers.......A stylus takes care of those sensitive fingers!!<br /><br />ENJOY:-)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini&#34;s writing uses such enjoyable, fresh expressions in our language!  His descriptions of everything from scenes to human emotions just draws one in.  &#34;Kite Runner&#34; hooked me, and &#34;Mountains Echoed&#34; lived up to expectations.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Price cannot be beat! Fun and engaging pastime while winding down after long days while assigned to a wildfire. Highly recommend.
B005JJCMN0|5.0|call me trite, i love the kurosawa san. a beautiful, to me, summation of a beautiful life's work. cinematography, story, reverence and appreciation...
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I have not really played this game. Its probably fun. Actually i dont know anything about it. I suck. Why am i here.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the best product I have used. Direct streaming through PC/tablet/smart phone with only 35 dollar, this is greatest bargain you could get for the similar product. Easy to use and install. The only issue here is that not much 3rd party application could apply on it now. It will required more time to complete the peripheral application, which gives this a great potential value and possibility in future.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Every time I watched an episode, I couldn't wait until the next to see what was going to happen.  Excellent story line.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game, plays really well on my kindle. Find it hard to collect all the items, but then I don't play via face book.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|The slickest Nexus 4 bumper case, hard plastic plus the &#34;metal&#34; finish gives it a crisp look and feels good in the hand.
068484267X|5.0|As a bookseller for over 45 years, I have come in contact with thousands and thousands of books. If I had to pick just one - this would  be it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is new to me and I will have to learn how to play it.  I don't usually spent too much time playing games unless they are recommended by friends.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Keeps me entertained for hours! I really enjoy playing this game. Thanks Epic Pixel for another hit! I can't wait to see the next one.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Unless you watch YouTube all day this sucks!  Don't get this if you want a good functional unit to use your different online components.  Thanks so much for the refund!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very addictive and reminiscent of the old middle command game, but with modern controls at last.  Finally a good modern interpretation of the old game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great story - imaginative,  well-written and great characters. I can't wait to dig in to the next one to see what happens next!
B0025KVLUQ|1.0|half the song wondt play rite skipped,jumped to the next song,played 1 verses and stop.since Ive got 2 write 5 more words, Liked the original the remastred needs some remastering!
1476734941|3.0|Now I know why many of the reviews said they really did not have to read the book.... Not much worthwhile.  And no, I have not tried the diet yet.
B0016CVN02|4.0|Great sound Clear as a bell Strongly recommended Would by more Hot Rocks by other artitsts from Amazon and online
B005DJREJS|5.0|This made me think of a young Carrie Bradshaw from SATC.  Cute and entertaining.  Love the short episodes.  Much better than other stuff from MTV.
B00CHMBQRA|2.0|The daughter was so annoying. Ridiculously so. She was so upset that her father was an ex special OPS CIA agent, could kill people with his bare hands and basically beat up anyone that followed them. Her father spoke Russian, English, French, etc. etc. This was a problem for her. She lived in Belgium. This was a problem for her. She was spoiled. This was a problem for her. She wasn't given 100% attention. This was a problem for her.<br /><br />This movie would have been great with more Olga K and less stupid daughter.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Breath taking!! I want more of Christian and Ana, I just can't get enough of them.  This book was fun and witty but had sad and erotic parts all in one!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Thought this was a great book.  If you have any medical background, you will appreciate the scientific approach to presenting the information.  But the fact that it was also told from the human and emotional aspect makes it even more impactful.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good for free, not always spot on.  You have to go local for our weather. I like that you can put the city you are visiting, easy to pack that way. For free it's usable, try it.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Totally old-world gruesome and plenty of action. I loved Hansel and Gretel, as well as the actors, Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works like a charm.. It would have been even more amazing if it supported more apps. MaxGo should be the next app it supports.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very entertaining. lots of fun games. this game really challenging. takes a while to unlock all the games but that's not a problem.
B00AYB16EO|4.0|Hacks on hit movie thriller 'MAMA' with a good collection of comedian actors like Charlie Sheen and Cat Williams also Snoop Dag makes an appearance
B008JFUNWS|3.0|This movie wasn't as interesting as the first one and The c.g.i special effects were fine from both!<br />Changing Percy's father from the Greek god Zeus to Poseidon from the original myths and making him a teenager wasn't all that original!<br />I've not read the books but, the writer needs more creativity to have used 1) Perseus, from where the main character derives his name with other Greek myths like 2) Jason, the leader of the Argonauts who retrieved the golden fleece, 3) Odysseus that battled the same sea monster \\"Charybdis\\" in title of \\"Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters\\" including a cyclops and 4) the story of Zeus killing his father Kronos cannibalizing his children! I still hope for another sequel but, this movie deserves only two and a half out of five stars!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|A good game keeps you thinking and your mind active. Good fun if you like to games that test your observation abilities.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does what it's ment to well. Can't beat the price with the Netflix offer. What more do you want?  It's Google
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device small compact, and fits into your TV but there are some notes:<br /><br />The Chromecast needs power and it comes with a USB power adapter that you can either plug into an outlet or an empty USB slot on your TV.<br /><br />In the Google conference where they debuted the Chromecast, it was advertised that it would turn your TV on from an off state, and play your content. I am assuming that this is ONLY the case with the NEWEST T.V.'s as this functionality doesn't work on my year old Samsungs.<br /><br />Overall great device, great quality, no network problems.<br /><br />Caution, after prolonged use, it does get pretty hot, so just be aware of that.
B00447G29S|5.0|Excellent quality!  The 3D is amazing.  It will snow in your living room.  The train comes right out of the screen.  The sound is crystal clear.  Worth every penny. Honest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute i couldn't stop playing! This was a definite download i think it is worth downloading!
B009AY04A8|4.0|A little hard to see some of the hidden pictures on my smart phone.  I think it would be much better game for a tablet.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Very well written and informative.  The hike related to her life issues.  Very inspiring as to what she accomplished alone as a woman.  Also learned about the pct which I did not know about.
B0051OZ564|4.0|The movie was good. But I like this kind of thing. I could see how many folks could have over looked it.
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|Good app. Crashed severally tho when i tried to access my basket. Guess it needs more work on it. Can be better.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is a must have for anyone that likes a great acting. One of the best acted shows on. No trash or vulgarity. I can watch a good adult drama and not have to turn the channel if my 5 year old walks in the room.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loved this game, first few days, then became bored with it. Awesome tho coz it's free. Recommend it when you don't have absolutely anything to do.
0385344228|4.0|Defending Jacob was named one of the must-read thrillers of 2012, and I can see how it earned this title. I read it immediately after Herman Koch's The Dinner, and the two both have a similar slant. It made it hard not to compare the two stories of parents with children accused of a horrible crime, and each author's exploration of the limits of love and morality.<br /><br />Defending Jacob's titular character is an upper class 15-year-old boy accused in the murder of a classmate. However, the story is narrated by his father, an attorney with a closet full of family secrets that span generations. The story unfolds through court testimony alternating with traditional narration -- it's an interesting way to deal with the flashbacks required to unfurl the story.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is one of those stories that sticks with you for a long time. Helmed by a truly unreliable narrator, it's an interesting take on nature vs. nurture, a sometimes shocking study of the limitations of family love and a purely enjoyable mystery filled with truly unexpected twists and turns.<br /><br />If you love thrillers, suspense and mystery that walks the line of disturbing, definitely pick up Defending Jacob. Based on the title and cover art, it could easily be mistaken for a procedural courtroom drama -- don't be fooled. This is a dark and twisted, discussion-worthy ride. Highly recommended.
B004D9FLJE|2.0|I could watch the first dvd but the rest wouldn't even play.  was very disappointed.  never wanna buy from this seller again.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|After  a while of being slowly annoyed and confused and wanting to find out what on earth was going on I realised that I was actually starting get involved with the character.  Intentional or not i dont know, but i was hooked.  The hero was no doubt going through all the same.  Really picked up and had a good twist at the end.  Well I didn't see it coming like that anyway.  Good enjoyable reading although I am a sucker for quaint little towns with a sinister undercurrent.
B002SRQ214|5.0|AMD Phenom II X4 965 AM3 3.4Ghz 512KB 45NM 125W 4000MHZ . I love it thank you. Get the best it's AMD
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game recommended by me and all the allies on mars rover super galactic conquest pong pong ping pong point London Medici kskdoso
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good:  great time killers &amp; a way to have some fun.  most games self explanatory,  which is good cause;<br />Bad:  no directions for the games.<br />Ugly:  games like the aquarium hard to see the things ur trying to avoid w/ ur finger on the screen.
B009NTNHJU|4.0|IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY NEPHEW ,HE OWES IT TO SOMEONE BECAUSE HE DAMAGED THE ONE THAT WAS LOANED TO HIM
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Using it to stream Netflix. I'm looking forward to using HBO Go and Hulu when that becomes available. So far highly recommend!
1452126607|5.0|I bought this for my husband to hang at work. He is a Grumpy Cat fanatic and loves this. I asked if he wanted to wait until 2014 to hang it and he gave me the Tard face and said &#34;No!&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app for my kids but now I can't stop playing it. This game is cute and fun.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|maybe I was expecting something more like the last Agnetha's album... songs on &#34;A&#34; are very easy and sound simple, I prefer to hear her voice in &#34;darker&#34; sound
B00571F26Y|4.0|I had been gluten free for one month when a friend suggested this book. It has a lot of good information in it, but every time I sat down to read it, it literally put me to sleep. A lot of the book is very technical - doctor's language - and I found myself fast forwarding on my Kindle. I wish the book were more concise, less verbose. He is a little extreme for me, but he certainly reinforced  the reasons to be gluten free.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Creative, some information was new to me, but basically gorilla marketing to get you to buy another book. Very Smart!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter so that she can continue to build and develop her technological skills.  She does so well at understanding the concepts that I thought the price and her pleasure was well worth the purchase.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|It's amazing! The voices of the actors and actresses in this movie blend in very well. However, it was missing Titanium (the best part!!!).
1401937519|5.0|Wow!  What an inspirational story. I have passed this book on to two friends already. If you like to read about spiritual experiences and near death then you will treasure this book.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|The acting is great! The film takes acapella to a whole new level as well as showing college life. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie . I like Barbara Streisand very much and thought it would be a funny movie. I found it to be just OK. The acting was good, just didn't feel the story line was entertaining. Sorry Barbara, but this isn't one of my faves.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Very enjoyable I had a great time with this app. I'm still going through my old photos. Lots of fun.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is another great hit by gaga...her mind is insane. The sounds and undertones of are songs are painted on a record like fine art. She's talking about coming back from an injury that stopped her career basically, to now come back and want to hear her fans again....I love her! Great song, and I can't wait to see her perform on the VMA's!!!!!
B003AWRMCE|5.0|The movie contains all the ingredients to make it great for all times. For example, the characters are well developed, and I mean each and everyone of them to the last detail. The script is a masterpiece of western lingo speaking, but well spoken and redacted, which is the premise of the plot:<br />  &#34;ALICE<br /> All she done was... when she<br /> seen he had a teensy little<br /> pecker... she gave a giggle.<br /> That's all.  She didn't know<br /> no better.&#34;<br />It shows a period in the American history that fast faded after the civil war: western justice, bounty hunting, extrajudicial executions and punishments. The explosive combination of Gene Hackman, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman just blows on the screen with the classic brutality and bloodshed of gunslingers and bounty hunters, rogue lawmen, assassins, unscrupulous businessmen (Skinny), and of course the prostitutes.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I would've liked an easier way to pause the streaming. My comp. located in different room, and in order to pause.
B00ALSOKSY|4.0|The first three (or so) chapters revealed very valuable insights and I would recommend these chapters to anyone.  Once the book got into statistics I changed my mind about who I would recommend it to, specifically, I'd recommend it to people who've had introduction to statistics. It becomes very complicated and difficult to follow - especially while driving. My husband has the hardback version and I'm sure I would never read that.  So I do recommend the audio but be sure to take care when referencing the PDF file with the diagrams.  The portions of the book on decision making were amazing!  I'm glad I hung in there til the end.
B007PS0DTI|1.0|Kate Beckinsale in a black vinyl jumpsuit. Pretty actress, inane plot, comic book scripting. That about covers it, I think.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is one of the greatest, most enduring science fiction series ever! I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys &#34;whimsical&#34; science fiction. It is well done and David Tenant is one of the &#34;Doctor Who&#34; portrayers yet!<br />Amazon Prime is also an excellent vehicle in which to view the Doctor Who series!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of my favorite games to play. I play it every day. I wish you could give us more than 17 coins per day though.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device works very well at what it does.  It needs more sources than You Tube and Netflix, and the tab mirroring from the Chrome browser lags a bit.  But for playing Netflix, or a You Tube video, the performance is great.<br /><br />Controlling the Netflix player is something else, as it requires using the Netflix app.  From my Android phone, the Netflix app seems to often forget that it's playing via Chromecast, and has to reconnect.  On my MacBook, Netflix wanted to install &#34;Silverlight&#34;, which is pretty ridiculous for a remote control (all that I want it to do).<br /><br />Bottom line: worth the price for now, may mature into a fantastic product.
1452110581|4.0|This book is just a simple and silly as its cover seems, but it's fun.  A good stocking stuffer for someone who loves cats.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not have been better* anyone who has even one regret about their life & it's path should read this
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|still waiting for it to come on for next session on tv, Kevin Bacon, is very very good in it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Google I normally love their stuff. Chromecast left me wondering why a great company like Google would produce a product with so little in the way a capabilities
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a very fun game. It reminds me of the popular game world of Warcraft. There are thousands of quest and you can create parties to complete quest together.  you can battle each other etc. if you've played world war craft then this is just like it only its played with touch screen and controls are better. this game does have some glitches.  Example I had to reinstall my game for a quest because it glitch so bad I couldn't go inside the building to finish it. other thank the glitches its still very fun. oh yeah its also tough getting customer service.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This game is great. For those who can't open the game, go to settings, applications, apps, running, Asphalt 8, clear cache.  Then open the game again. It will now work.  The game looks great, plays wonderful. No lag in online multiplayer. Servers can take a while to get enough racers. It's very hard to get the cars you need to win without spending lots of money.
6304806442|5.0|&#34;Sid & Nancy&#34; - a Must have & only &#34;Trainspotting&#34; could follow.  When I was that age we never did anything to have so much fun.  Does breaking off sharpened pencils in all the door locks before school count?  If you're not offended by the use of intravenous drugs - you'll have a great good time.  If that particular activity makes you sick to your stomach - this film is not for you.  In fact, Sid & Nancy is not for you either...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's basically a book about survival in the direst of circumstances.  Wonderful, real characters who suck you into their world.  Great for adults and older children.
B00CATSONE|5.0|interesting book to read about a man that did not let his imagination go wasted as he followed his dreams and made innovated discoveries.  this book was a insightful look at innovation at its finest
B004UQ03P2|5.0|This product makes reading and writing on my macbook much easier on the eyes. Great for long hours of work and recreation!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the game lot of fun.  loads of excitement. yay good for passing time and or downtimes. would recommend to others
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Great app for Kindle Fire 7&quot; HD. Gives great info and very easy to navigate! Looks great too! Get it, you'll use it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how the missions not only increase your multiplier but unlike other games with a similar style, this game has achievements you can unlock and earn points that you can use to buy things.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|Loved it it basically let me do whatever i Want  and hare wht you make its a cool app to have
B009C7JS14|4.0|This app worked quite well. Not much problems that I encountered. It's free so just try it out and see if you'll like it.
0061122416|5.0|This is not a man for all seasons but a story for all seasons, about the riches within, being resourceful and bring true to yourself.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|If you like tycoons and dragons, this game is for you! Warning: be ready to have no more free time xD
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|BEST BOOK I READ EVER I LOVED IT SO MUCH IT WAS EXCELENT PERFECT FOR TEENS OR TWEENS I LOVED IT
B008S4YZCO|3.0|Seems kinda cool, but still figuring it out.  Ugh to finding live friends, I know no-one who wants to play.....but cool nonetheless.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is beyond my expectation. It is very enjoyable and convenient, very good choice, especially at such a low price.<br />Pros:<br />Small in size, and no need to connect to electricity, nice design.<br />Cons:<br />Only support youtube and netflix. Can only sync static contents form Chrome browser to Chrome Cast.<br /><br />I will recommend other to have one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy and compact alternative to Roku love it, easy to install, wish it had better iPhone integration not bad HD
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Looks very nice, fits well.<br />Phone buttons work as well as when I was using without cover.<br />The headphone and micros USB connectors are as easy to get to when I was using without cover.<br /><br />Does not add much bulk to the phone; seems to provide sufficient protection.<br />If you are prone to dropping the phone often, you may want to look for a thicker bumper or full cover (though that may not fit as nicely as this one).
B005LAIH3G|5.0|The novels are classics of science fiction, but they were far from perfect.<br /><br />The filmakers took some justified liberties with the source material and ended up with a film that is epic and leaves the viewer filled with a sense of awe.<br /><br />Spectacular film from the director of Wall-E.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use it everyday! Looking forward to when more apps will be compatible. I really would like to see Hulu and AETV work with it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I Love this GAME  it's so cool who ever made this GAME I would say thank you for making it a great game to play with
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Love the series and couldn't wait to watch the whole thing again, without advertisements.  I will definitely be ordering season three.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|On of the best books I have read in a long time.  It shows what love can do between man and cat.  It should be made into a movie to show people that there is goodness in this world.  It also shows not to give up on yourself.
140006922X|5.0|This book gave me a different perspective and really opened my mind to other possibilities than the ones I had learned as a child.  I thought the author did an excellent job describing the divisions of the time.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|A perfect companion to the head set.  A great case for the head set plus the added bonus of the ability to keep it charged.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Just lovely. Read it on one sitting. Although our lives were more &#34;normal&#34; it reminded me of my husband and me's relationship.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|It pulls you in, in the beginning and never lets up.  I like the way it moves from character to character.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Having never published anything, let alone a story, I found this manual helpful. The book took me through the details of publishing online with Amazon.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Yep, that describes this game: cute and fun. Not quite as awesome as the original missile command, but hey.  definitely worth the download.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|really doesnt seem like much but its good. very fun played it for a while before i got off. :)
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I doubted I'd ever need 5 of these batteries (the Toyota Prius is 4 years old and the batteries have just now failed on both keys). But horsing around with local Wal-Marts wound up costing us a fair amount of $$ and considerable chasing around (e.g., one store, in metro Hartford, only carries singles, not the cheaper-per-unit doubles of the replacement batteries). Buying the Maxell 5-pack the day the first battery failed would have been cheapest and easiest, by far.
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|This was a replacement cd. I'm totally happy with the cd. However the packaging was too light and the case was damaged.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Perfect for my attachments in email that i need to view, create or edit. I often use pdf and excel file. This app make it easy for me.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Really good... refreshingly honest read, Caitlin holds nothing back and the reader is the better for it. I would recommend.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|While this game is certainly fun and easy to jump into for a short session, the way upgrades is handled needs some tweaking. The game gives you tons of upgrade points at the beginning and then gives you a handful for each level completed. Furthermore, it's not clear if your performance influences this in any way.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It reminds me of the old Atari game around 1980. I'm still seeing how far up the upgrades will go.
B008RKGF1I|4.0|I have always like to watch this movie. Have seen it several time and enjoy it each time.  Probably will watch it again
B00B935SUY|4.0|A great film if you are a lover of American rock music. Watching it online was convenient and other than some minor glitch delays which required a restart... the experience was good.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Great diet...works like a charm...my days are Mondays and Thursdays...lost about 3/4 lbs per week...easy to loose weight safely and gradually...no miracle pill here...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time! I cannot wait to read it again! Awesome
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Great movie. Great story line, plot, soundtrack. Everything. Plus the 1980's vintage feel gives it that extra flashback as well back to my childhood and gives it more realism and personalizes it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They need to create a second subway surfers . To be honest there needs to be more characters . I still think it's better than all of the temple runs combined.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book so much that it's hard to write a review, if that makes sense. I think it because my emotion right  now is at it's peak.<br /><br />But what I can say is that it's wonderfully written and it's SO worth your time and money. Don't hesitate and start reading now!
B00CHVJODE|5.0|I really loved THE CROODS.  A family comedy/adventure from DreamWorks Animation, I had been waiting to see this one - the story of caveman Grug (Nicolas Cage) and his family, as they struggle to survive when both their home and way of life are change forever.<br /><br />Grug has spent his entire parental life teaching his wife and children to be careful.  Change is BAD, darkness is to be feared, and you never ever stray too far from home.  This makes life a little difficult in their prehistoric desert landscape - even fighting for the smallest scraps of food is just that, a fight.  As hard as Grug has worked to maintain safety, he still constantly butts heads with his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone), whose natural sense of over-curiosity puts, Grug feels, the family at risk.  When Eep sneaks out of the cave one night and accidentally runs into the free spirit Guy (Ryan Reynolds), she is at first frightened but also very intrigued of him.  And when Guy informs her of the impending end of the world, Eep is as fearful as Grug is skeptical ... until the family's cave is destroyed (in a great action sequence), and the Croods are forced to leave their home and trek across the vast landscape (led by Guy, much to Grug's chagrin and terror), staying just ahead of the destruction as Guy steers them toward safety, and Grug becomes more and more jealous of Guy's taking over as the alpha male of the group.<br /><br />'The Croods' is really funny, the humor leaning toward pratfalls and slapstick - but the film also has its share of tender/real moments that ring true.  The animation is stunning, the film a feast for the eyes, and by the end you will be rooting like hell for the clan all the way.  Nothing really new here, but the characters and story and humor and animation make it all feel fresh, funny and enjoyable, with positive messages for kids about sticking by your family and not being afraid to get out there and explore life and the world around you.<br /><br />Yeah, I got sucked in - I loved it.sucked in - I loved it.
B008AWBQGM|4.0|This new collection is well done and I strongly recommend it for Skynyrd Fans. Best they've done since Vicious Cycle. This band is still one of the best. Despite all the tragedy, there is no better rock show out there. Free Bird is easily the greatest finale to a concert. A bit surprised that they did perform any of these new tunes at the show, but they have so many classics that they have to do, can't play for 3 hours.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|My favorite movie. I just love the scenes and the acting is the best. Eva Marie Saint is very stunning
B00C8985DU|5.0|A bit expensive, but a great set for McCa fans. After seeing him on tour, doing some of the old Wings material, just had to have this set. Not disappointed.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|One of the best. Ingrid Bergman is such a wonderful actress. Humphrey Bogart I always enjoy. He is also good in the African Queen.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Come on its his turning point album. He's great and at his best here. If you love him buy this album
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I bought the album without listening to it any. I have all of his music and I trust no matter what he makes I will like.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|Always a great watch. Better every time. A great story about friendship and youth and the adventures that come with it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Ok, if you're in the mood for an easy, laid back way to waste your time and energy with mind numbing challenges and lame graphics, then this is NOT the app for you.  Oh yes I did, that was a trick but this game is a treat!  Fun for all ages, shoot, if my cat could focus for longer than 8 seconds I think he'd even have fun playing, and let's face it, cats are picky!  Go ahead and try it, you will love it.  And if you don't then teach your cat.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game fun to play enjoyed the levels. Not bad for a free  app. Not sure about played version. Wish there where Notre free levels
B002MQYOFW|5.0|... that &#34;the book is much better than the movie?&#34; I saw the movie first and, actually, was not impressed with the movie OR the story. Reading the book... what a FANTASTIC story! So much for the expertise of  screen adaptation people on this one! I'm now reading &#34;Catching Fire,&#34; the second book in the trilogy. So far, it's very engrossing. I understand that the movie adaptation is coming soon. I hope that the people working on this one, do it some justice this time!  A great read!
B004G600A4|1.0|It worked for about a month and then it stopped working.  My girls were so sad.<br />Maybe we received a faulty DVD
B006S08RLU|5.0|While we all are busy with daily life, there are some simple things about love that Amelie reminds us. The film visual arts and sounds are fabulous and smart.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This is the first Sherlock book I've ever owned, and it will probably also be my last.  The book list is exhaustive, I don't think there is anything in the collection that's left out.  As far as I've read, the language is pristine and the organization of the book is enjoyable.  Die hard Sherlock fans may have more to contribute, but as a first time reader this is more than acceptable.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like telling so but my &quot; future &quot; map never works. I'll be sitting on my back deck, watching it pour down with Rain and the map in motion is always blank. Kinda ruins it for me but, like the title says, the new update for accuweather ruined the whole app.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Unless there are going to be some kick ass functions added soon, This dongle will end up in the back of my junk draw with the rest of the crap I brought thinking it would change the world.
