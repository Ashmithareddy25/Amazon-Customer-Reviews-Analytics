B0080MPUUK|5.0|Have seen this movie multiple times and just love it.  Woody Allen is amazing.  It takes a lot to make me laugh and Woody Allen has done it!
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Didn't know I wasn't purchasing a 'whole' movie. What I saw was okay, but I should have waited until I could get the entire production.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|I'm used to 4 stars being the highest rating of a movie. This is not a 4 star movie, but in a five star amazon world it is a 4 star movie if only for uniqueness.  This a for-grownups movie that is creative, interesting and compelling.  It's a thought-provoking action movie that is very well rounded and non-gratuitous.<br /><br />Cinematography: very well done.  Acting: very well done.  Script: well-thought out and avante-garde.  Casting: The right actors were cast in the right parts, and the casting increased the quality of the movie.  Direction: expertly done.  The director played a nice balance between no boredom factor, yet no over-actioning the movie.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Glad I had faith in the author to pursue the subject in an irresistible manner, since I thought the subject sections seemed a bit limited. Not so!!! Cooked food has given man an evolutionary advantage...something I never remotely considered. And did you know that in medieval times Englishmen were thought to be gourmet as opposed to the lowly French? And how about the fact that humans contain more microbial cells than human cells? And did you ever hear that the biological flora in your gut might be responsible for obesity, and that it is important to &#34;feed&#34; this flora if you want to remain in optimal health? Why do some cheeses smell like dirty feet...or worse? The answer may surprise (and disgust?) BTW I learned that disgust is a singularly human emotion.<br /><br />If you have a restless mind, and interest in both cooking and cooking history, this book is for you!
B009LROCJI|5.0|I fell in love with this recomposed version of the Four Seasons within the first minute of listening to a youtube video. I immediately bought the album and listened to it on repeat for at least two months.<br /><br />Great album! 5 stars! Get it!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Although it's a running story that holds your interest I could miss one or two and still pick it up easily and enjoy. Now as a prime videos I can go back and watch in order. It's better than most TV and gives you something to watch until the next good series shows up.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I visited the Nikola Tesla statue in Niagara falls and became interested in his work after reading about his contributions with the Niagara power plant. I loaded this book onto my kindle (because it is FREE!) and quickly read it in a lazy afternoon.<br />This book is far from a biography, but still is an interesting read. The book begins as an explanation of the qualities and characteristics of the famous geniuses in history. The middle of the book walks us through Tesla's work in the science community and his relationship with Thomas Edison. The end of the book brings together the concepts learned in the first portion of the book with Tesla's work.<br /><br />I suggest that everyone reads this book! Tesla is really an unsung hero in the science community and to the age of technology. No worries if you are science illiterate. This book explains most of the physics terms pretty well. It's a super easy read, so there is no excuse to skipping over this wonderful gem!
B001NLL93W|3.0|If you're a fan of convoluted geneology, you'll enjoy the DNA aspects of the family involved. If you're a fan of adult characters sitting around discussing impending doom and then having a teenager talk them i to making the right decision, this will be the icing on the cake. If you thought the incestious nature of the Luke-Leia combo was cool, you'll get a rise out of the Jace-Clary story. And of course, there's a teenager-adult gay relationship woven into the storyline along with the proverbial vampire who can walk in sunlight. Overall it's an average story with supernatural overtones and a Darth Vader type of villian who enjoys thoughts of subjugating the world. It's not necessary to read the first three books, but if you start from book 1, you'll have to read books 2 and three. Anything after that is optional.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This is a cute game, and pretty fun. The only thing bad, so far, is that it seems to freeze quite a bit, and when it does, it makes you die in the game.<br /><br />So, that really sucks, the game slows down, and it causes you to die.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|i saw this movie when it came out and then saw it again on the TV.  I't a great story, great acting and great actors.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|the WHOLE game should be free :/ its not fair that you have to pay half of the game when the game in the app store was free
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Heard this cd while on flight to Puerto Rico and could not help but listen it over 3 times. Can't wait for her next one!
0783231202|5.0|The product was exactly what I was looking for and a great price.  Would recommend to others.  Speedy delivery and very much satisfied.
B001GMQALY|5.0|Excellent photography, acting and soundtrack. I have seen this film many times and enjoy it every time. Adrian Lyne is an excellent director.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Personally I love minecraft got it on my computer it's great but minecraft realms needs fixed the servers are always full and I can never get in it also doesn't refresh so I keep clicking and unclicking it. It's just to exhausting. Other than that great game.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I loved it I read it in 12 hours READ IT!!!!!!!!!! And I mean it all of you people that love mysterious and romantic books!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed game, gets more challenging as it goes along. I would recommend this just needs more rooms which am looking forward too!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome there are a lot of cute dragons I can't stop playing the igneous dragon is so cute
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story line and much action. A great prequil to &#34;The Hit.&#34;  Will Robie charachter is full of surprises.  Loved it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|My goodness this was a great book. It evokes many feelings an  takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. It was so very interesting to read about these times. I would recommend this book for anyone who has an interest in history.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great boom an  would recommend it to anyone  interested in the SEALS or who want to learn more about what we as active duty sacrifice to get the job done.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I had not seen Before Sunrise until this year when I noticed all the hype for Before Midnight (which I haven't seen...yet). I related more to the characters in Before Sunset, they've matured and the chemistry is still there. I like the opening song, but loved the closing song. Can't wait to see Before Midnight in the theatre.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|This movie was way better than I thought it would be. I loved it! Excellent. I am in a debate with myself as to whether it was a 5 star or a 4 star. Lol
B000FA675C|5.0|I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said about this book.  It was interesting, suspenseful, and at the time, unique.  A recommended read
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I have Amazon Prime which makes watching any of these Terminator-Sarah Connor Chronicle episodes free and super easy to do!<br /><br />I loved all the Terminator movies and this just adds to giving a season series sense of it in way to enjoy it. I think their great, and &#34;Summer Glau&#34; John Connors Terminator protector is so hot, might be another reason I loved the show so much. LOL
B004J4WN0I|4.0|3.5-4 stars<br /><br />Enjoyed this book - getting caught up in this \\"world\\". Atticus still seems impetuous and \\"young\\" despite his 2100 years.<br /><br />Really love the funny stuff with his neighbors - both the guy across the street and the widow down the road. Loved the stuff with his new Druid trainee, too. I can see that G will be an asset to the series. And of course, his dog Oberon is amazing!<br /><br />Learning about a whole new pantheon of gods - I was never particularly \\"up\\" on the Celtic gods. I didn't even realize that the Tuatha de Danan (sp?) were supposed to be Irish gods. I always thought they were the Fae, plain and simple. Or not so simple, as it turns out from reading this book.<br /><br />I appreciate The Morrigan a lot - more than in the prequel short stories (chronologically speaking by the numbers). She's quite the character! And Brigid, too. I appreciate how the author keeps the capriciousness of the \\"gods\\" up-front-and-center, regardless of which pantheon they belong to. The encounters with Mary are... dunno the word. Perhaps a bit amusing and disturbing at the same time? I'm not Catholic, so I've never seen Mary as a god, exactly; but I suppose that if people pray to her (and to the Saints), that qualifies them, right? Coyote's and Atticus' discussion of the various forms of each of the gods, including Jesus are downright funny. And shows that \\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy\\" once again.
B00AG47198|2.0|i was told how humorous it was and bought/returned it because it was dark humor. a typical E.M. movie i suppose.
B00ACP3OOM|3.0|Most of what others have said are spot-on, but I wanted to emphasize two things: 1. if you swim breast stroke, this isn't for you.  It works best when your head is underwater.  When you breast stroke, your head moves in and out of the water, so the sound is constantly going up and down.  And 2. if you listen to Audible audiobooks (which are \\"protected\\"), you cannot listen to them on this unit.  These two things made it unworkable for me, but if you are a freestyle swimming music listener, then this may very well work for you.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have loved playing this. I have a Xoom and this game is really addictive. From the first day you'll love it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|just ok. the older app was better for my Kindle. Larger buttons and fonts easier to use and navigate. This version doesn't make sense to me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging without being too difficult, can't wait until their are more levels to figure out how to escape from.
0553801473|5.0|George R.R. Martin has hit another blockbuster, and as usual leaves more questions unanswered than he answers.  I can't wait for Book 6.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is by far one of the best apps I have ever owned! Tip: If you have a battery optimizer app, optimizing will allow you to replay the round. Toodles:)
B0064MPXFA|1.0|We really like this show, but Amazon Instant streaming on our Roku device is so bad. We don't have trouble with Netflix or Hulu Plus, but Amazon's channel is always freezing.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I don't know why but I love this movie.  It is a tragic love story.  Brad Pitt looks good and plays his role well and really everyone in the movie is good.  A balance of war and love.<br /><br />It was also interesting to see how they made the movie and all of the trouble they had with locations and the hurricane destroying the set.  Very talented  people make those sets as well.  Cool stuff to observe!
B00BSW6F26|2.0|Couldn't play it because it would not let me in.Thegame looked interesting but I couldn't play it. The graffic on the first page was good and I  would have liked to see the rest.
B0053FANRC|2.0|I have all of the Fast FIve movies and this one may be the worst one.  It is not good.  The car scenes are cool and the cars themselves are nice to look at but none of the 'stars' of the franchise are in this movie except for VD cameo at the end and it is just not that great of a storyline.  I mean I don't really watch these movies for storyline I really just like seeing P Walker, V Diesel and Tyrese and the cars are nice.  This is not the best of the franchise.  Kind of blah.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Its fun and easy and 100% recommend this game(: The missions it asks you to complete makes it more addicting...LOVE IT!
B00005JM4Z|3.0|This movie is okay.  Decent acting.  I think Tyrese did a great job in it and PW is always looking good and playing his part. Storyline is okay. Acting is okay. Car action is okay.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is the first time I have tried an Escape game. I usually play Hidden Object games for the puzzles more than the hidden object part. Now I have a new love. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because some of the items that I found were<br /> hard to figure out what they were. Maybe if the name of the items could show when you put your cursor over the items.
B004GJYRA0|4.0|Great actors.  Good storyline.  I really liked this movie and how it used color and b/w as a way to talk about racism, sexism etc.  Very interesting.
B001R6AW18|5.0|great movie!  i remember as a kid, they would show all the kong movies and mighty joe young on thanksgiving day, then the next day it was all godzilla all day long.  awesome memories!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|One of the best games ever. I like it because you can make a Brandon zoo. I give it a 5 out of 5.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I liked Tina Fey when I decided to purchase her book, and now I must say I adore her. Her blunt humor and self-deprecation made me laugh out loud. I appreciate that she went into honest detail about her life (particularly the downs). And it was fun to see a bit about SNL and 30 Rock- one of the best shows ever. Thank you, Tina!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son and I had fun figuring out these puzzles. They were challenging but not super challenging. We would like some more of the same.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I liked this movie. A lot better than I expected and it well worth buying. Kids always enjoy these movies and I do too.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|I hated Silk, the browser that came with my Kindly Fire HD - but I read an article recommending Dolphin.  One reason I didn't like Silk - a BIG reason - is that it didn't support Flash Player, and therefore you couldn't watch anything on YouTube.  The YouTube app is really awful, so I installed Dolphin which does support Flash Player.  The only thing is that occasionally Dolphin will just crash while watching videos on YouTube.  I haven't had it crash using other websites, just YouTube.  I have updated the browser, and the problem hasn't gone away.  YouTube works most of the time, though, so I'm not going to uninstall it.  I tried Google Chrome, and Opera, but they just don't have the features that I like with Dolphin, and they don't work as well (YouTube works on Chrome about less than half the time)  One thing I love about Dolphin is that you can set it to work in several different &#34;modes&#34;, like Desktop, Mobile, Android, and others.  This is helpful with YouTube, because sometimes videos are not accessible if you're using mobile or Android mode.  A great little browser!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great movie. I think it worth getting Kids and their friend has watch it over and over again. A must for any Dark Knight fan.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a simple calculator that is easy to use, works well, and I haven't have any problems with it.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Took way to long to load. I got tired of waiting on it and ready lost interest I it<br />Enjoy Hidden Express on FB much more.Show me those.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen!  Terrible acting! Awful green screen shots!  Bring back The Real Wizard!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is the best!  I've listened to it so many times, I know most of the words!  Rod Stewart ROCKS!!!
1400049628|5.0|a must read for anyone who watches the living dead or any zombie movies, then you can decide which is right the movies or book. it is fun to read
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I had been intrigued about this story ever since we heard about her in the news. This book is not written with a ghost writer, it's her voice, her words. She tells her story. The story itself is heartbreaking, but at the same time it's a good book. I wish her and her family nothing but the best.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It keep me interested and of course I was surprised by the ending.  I would recommend it to most of my friends
6305511055|5.0|Robert Redford has remained consistent in his passion to get society to critically consider the implications of what our gov't is doing in the name of security. He is a true american hero!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is very helpful. You can put a lot of notebooks. You can put a lot of pages in one notebook and have a title for each page. You can put a lot of notebooks and make one secretly your Diary, on each page put the title as the date. It's also very good for a free app, I have no problems with it. Double thumbs up. Plus you can pick your style for the writing and the page. You can also have a voice read it to you, although in my opinion it should not have the whole voice thing it is slow and annoying. You can also put a picture on the corner of each page. There is also a sticky note there, although I don't really use it so I can't tell you about that one. It's also a good app if you write stories and stuff
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it is pretty awesome but it is always crashing. The wheels are always in the air.  So yah not that awesome.
B00168ML1G|3.0|the only problem was they show me a slip cover but it did not have it, when i ordered the blue ray i would not have ordered it if i was aware of this
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Was really hoping this would be as good as Downton Abbey. While entertaining, it didn't live up to that standard.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I, personally thought that it was really quite fun and it takes a bit of strategy too. So I thought it was good if you are looking for a game that will make you think.
B006DFIB7U|1.0|Got this movie after looking on line for it, had good reviews so I ordered it. Came in good time just before fathers day and when we went to watch it, wont play because it says cant play movie in region one, only in region two. Would of been nice to know this before I ordered it. Very disappointed.
B006WAIV6M|4.0|I read this in right time. I have been planning to give up some of my old habits.. Time to practice.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Exceptional cross platform note and file sharing app.  The web clipping is also awesome.  Both my wife and I use it all the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow. Just wow. Not as good as Minecraft PC or Xbox but it's the greatest game on the kindle fire and ios!!!!
B0001GL3K4|4.0|Great little film. Heartwarming. Nice for a heart tug and some laughs. Loved the actors and the plot. Very funny!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Wow. TRULY A GREAT SERIES. Lots of fun, from multiple character perspectives. A CLASSIC. In the tradition of Tolkein and Donaldson.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I don't like the zombie thing but the characters are developed so nicely that you are endeared to them. The post apocalyptic element is awesome as well. Hoe do you survive a hopeless situation? I love Andrew Lincoln as Rick. Great choice of casting.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Super awesome recommend to any marvel fan so many suits to unleash and build. Plus many missions to do. Must get.
6303477259|5.0|I rate this high. I love Pink Floyd and this was an awesome show. Picture quality could have been a bit better but this was a VHS tape. Great lineup of songs and the light show was incredible. David Gilmour is an awesome musician, songwriter and vocalist. How grateful we should all be he kept the Floyd alive. It would have been awesome to have Roger Waters there as well but not to be. Pink Floyd is at its best here!
B00846REIS|3.0|I'm really tired of reading the same story but with different names and places. It was hard to me connect with the characters, the just seemed so plastic.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|Nice concert but I like the earlier ones when they were younger and had more fire. Songs are always memorable but give me a concert in the 70s.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't really wanted to read this, so many friends has recommended it to me, however as soon as I start to know Sky I get intrigued and after that I just needed so badly to know what was going to happen. You just don't expect the twist in this book, I really enjoyed reading it!<br /><br />&#34;It's crap that you're letting one bad year determine your fate for the rest of your life&#34;
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I Got This For My Son A Very Big Doctor Who Fan Two Days Ago And He His Very Happy With It But He Was Telling Me That 1.They Could Of Made It A Little Bit More Durable 2.They Could Of Made It A Bit More Like The One From The TV Show Because He Said He Has Seen Pictures And Videos Of The Doctor With It And He Said They Could Instead Of Having A Button To Extend It By It Self Put It With The Sound Button Like In The TV Show But Despite This He Said It Is Fun
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have to say that this is a worth reading book, I enjoyed reading it, I cried a little, laugh and felt the love between Will and Lake. What happen to them is so unexpected that you can't stop reading until you know how is going to end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play this game to get my mind to relax and of course in this stressful world, I play it a lot.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I just wanted to read the first chapter, but couldn't stop reading until I finished it! I have to say that I loved Katie, all about her, despite the fears that was haunting her, she was strong enough to see herself with a difference lens, although she didn't realise how strong she was.<br /><br />&#34;That's the thing about life. A lot of the time, it isn't easy at all. We just have to try make the best of it&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Everyone has a past, but that's just it - it's in the past. You can learn from it, but you can't change it.&#34;
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Not only is this an excellent movie about how insurance companies screw over the public as they really do, but I was also in this movie in the final court scene when we filmed this on Alameda Island in Oakland, CA.  This is an eye-opener movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have mixed feelings just because when you read the book sometimes you hate Travis but then you love him and then again hate him, the same happens with Abby, I felt the need to shout at her and tell her to open her eyes. Great book, sometimes very complex characters.!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I pre-ordered this book and was just as happy with it as i was his previous books. His characters are so amazing and I was in love with the relationship between pari and abdullah, truly only Khaled Housseini can make brothers and sisters so precious.
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|If you are a Wizard of Oz fan, you will probably enjoy Oz The Great and Powerful. It opens in black and white the same way that TWOO does and goes to color once in Oz. The characters from the first one are tied to those in the second. The plot is a good preview of what came before TWOO. The outline of picking up three creatures on the adventure parallels TWOO. The thing that I don't particularly like plotwise is that it makes a hero out of a con man. It might be a good role model if he changed his ways, but it looks like he continues to be a con man.<br /><br />The acting is okay. The mean witches both did respectable jobs. Glinda the good witch was sort of flat for my taste. I think Oz (Franco) was theatrical, but the part called for it so that was okay. The supporting cast was great. The monkey and doll were cute. :)<br /><br />Anyway, the colors are eye popping. Imagination runs wild. It's a little bit violent for kiddies, but so is TWOO. I found it a bit too childlike for my adult tastes and probably wouldn't watch it again, but I'd recommend it for kids.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this wonderfully acted and moving story.  The two boys are amazing in their roles.  Growing up couldn't have been told in a better way.  Great acting, superb story, and an old fashioned feel to what will be a timeless classic.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a wonderful miniseries that BBC has produced.  This is based on the original serial novel by Elizabeth Gaskell and I think does the novel justice.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|easy to play. not hard to learn how to play. I like being able to add fish and other items. You can keep earning more money to spend.
B00A4AI0AS|4.0|Some of these concertoes are primo, magical, and I listen to them over and over again.  Some are so-so.  But Klemperer could bring out the best in some performers, no doubt.
B00B4804KS|5.0|While we enjoyed the original movie, we thoroughly enjoyed viewing the 3D version of this film! I highly recommend this DVD.
B00001NTXN|3.0|Opened brand new sealed packed and game board was just covered in dust.<br />These things must be slapped together in some overseas sweatshop where they don't care about their product.<br />It's a fun game to play with my 10 year grandson.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This simple story is so beautifully written that it literally pulls you into it.  You almost expect to see Stoner sitting on a bench near your home.
B003XDUCIG|5.0|An excellent book that covers all the details involved with cooking. Well written, passionate, and knowledgeable, the author really know his stuff, and does a great job of bringing it across in a straightforward and easy to read manner.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is amazing.  I cannot stop watching it.  Claire Danes is an outstanding actress.  The writing is amazing!  If you haven't seen this show, WATCH IT.
0446554995|3.0|I was once a proud Preston-Child completist. After being introduced to them via the first Pendergast trilogy -- which I loved -- I went back and read everything they'd ever written, including all their solo efforts. I gobbled up each subsequent release the day it came out. However, I found both \\"Fever Dream\\" and \\"Cold Vengeance\\" unsatisfying. Then came \\"Gideon's Sword,\\" which was so disappointing that I skipped the sequel. This is why I waited a few months before finally digging into \\"Two Graves.\\" Unfortunately, my hesitation was justified.<br /><br />Dozens of previous reviewers have already done a great job explaining why this is such a profound mess. I especially like the multiple \\"jump the shark\\" references, because that's exactly what the authors have done.<br /><br />Still, I'm giving it three stars because these guys remain gifted writers. There's plenty of fun packed into these pages, and I always enjoy reading all the arcane stuff they come up with. Alas, there's also tons of, \\"Come on, man -- really?!\\" moments. Not to mention the ancillary plots -- what the heck is Corrie Swanson doing in this story? -- that just bog everything down.<br /><br />I'll likely read the next Pendergast. But the love affair is officially over.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|t<br />This was fun. I am looking forward to many more levels. I really hope they come very soon. I also like having no hints to fall back on.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This is the beat children's movie, I've ever seen! I watched it many times and i never got bored of it. Totally entertaining for adults!!! I enjoyed every minute of it.
B0041OOJNU|4.0|I have all of her CD's and while this isn't my favorite of them, it's still a good assortment of tunes that has you moving along with the beat.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|If you have a young child this is the ultimate family film. I have an 8 year old girl and she has watched and loved this for years.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Drawing pad is a good time waster to do in the car/airplane.  A good thing about it is that you have many different types of drawing tools to pick out of. The price is good to me, so if you are looking for a good drawing app look no farther!
B0049J3QNG|4.0|The first one was excellent, this is good. Any film I can feel comfortable watching with my kid is a Godsend.
B009POHHRG|4.0|I rated it 4 because it was a varry good read but joker wouldn't act like that and nether while batman. I'm white after you read you will understand. For example batman would never laugh at Joker's jokes and Joker wouldn't tell batman a real joke trying to get him to laugh.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in preparation for the upcoming movie, and I greatly enjoyed it. People who don't like strategy games and such things will probably not enjoy it so much because, as others have noted, a good portion of the book centers around the Battle Room where the children are learning to command troops. All around I thought that the book was very well written and I can't wait for the movie!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is great. It makes/lets me see what my friends like. It lets me communicate with my friends if I can't text them.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is very helpful when on the go and charges extremely  fast and makes it great for carrying on the go
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It is more challenging as the game progresses and each round is timed.  If you don't complete the round in the allotted time, you have to repeat it.  It was frustrating at times for me, but very addicting.  Again, I loved it!  When I finished the game, it started over again.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|It took a long time to ship even with the upgraded shipping which was sad but once I got it -- it worked great! Note that this adapter does NOT work for the Nexus 7 tablet.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys' great musicianship and presentation delight the ears and eyes. This set contains both a CD and DVD with several of their entertaining videos. I never tire of listening to them.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I didn't like the way the story jumped back and forth..some parts were good, but it did not follow as easily as the first two books.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I truly love this series. I have talked to many other about this series and they love it as much as I do.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This is not a movie for people who enjoy gory,bloody and violent zombie flicks. I don't enjoy those kinds of films myself, so this was a treat for me. I did read the book, and it did skip over a few parts that I would have liked to see included in the film, but it did stay very close to the original story. It's funny, I didn't even recognize the Romeo and Juliet reference until I saw the movie! Hah! It was a sweet love story, and I believe that the moral of it was that people need to remember what is important in this world; our fellow man. Love and caring is what heals the world. It may sound sappy, but it wasn't a sappy movie. It was very touching and lovely. If you like love stories, but also like movies with bizarre twists then I would recommend this movie to you! It's worth the $3.99 instant video rental for sure!

B00C3MKCIS|1.0|\\"Dimensionaut\\"?  How about \\"Buyitnot\\"?<br /><br />Knowing this was a Simon Collins collaboration and concept album, I expected a lot.  Especially for a debut album that was essentially two-years in the making.  There are a few good moments here, but not enough for me to give it more than one-star (if I could, I would give it a 1/2 star).  Predictable, unoriginal, and pretty much trying too hard, Sound of Contact does not impress.  There's just nothing really new or remarkable about this album for those of us who have been around a while.  Having lived through the first space- and concept-rock era in the 70s (the progressive music of that time period), I'll take that era's offerings over this one from Sound of Contact any day.  Concept albums are meant to introduce new and epic concepts in musical expression, not rehash old ones.<br /><br />Before you spend dough on this album, let me just say there's a reason why neither the single nor the album have charted *anywhere*, *at all*, *in any way* since its European release almost a month ago and its American debut nearly three weeks ago.  My advice is: don't waste your money.  At best, this is a one-time listen of something already tried.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app allows me to have the peaceful and tranquil sounds that I have been trying to find on cds and audio downloads for forever. This is exactly what I was looking for - I just didn't know it till I tried it!
0307341577|3.0|3 1/2 stars<br /><br />It took me a while to think about what I wanted to write in my review. In fact, this is because Dark Places is one of those stories that digs into your flesh and doesn't let go, even days after you've read the last page and closed the book.<br /><br />Flynn, as usual, has a knack for writing dark stories about broken spirits and fractured personalities. Her strength, to me, is in giving us characters that are beyond three-dimensional and that, for whatever set of reasons, can't find a way to heal. They're a product of their history and their challenges and the unfairness that life throws at them.<br /><br />I was amazed with Dark Places, as I was with Gone Girl, though in a different way. I kind of figured out the plot line about halfway through the story, though this isn't a knock on Dark Places. If anything, guessing at what happened that murderous, fateful night only makes the book's climax even more chilling when you actually read through those pages as it happens.<br /><br />So what kept me from giving Dark Places 4 stars or greater? The style of writing. I am, first and foremost, a fan of evocative storytelling that grabs you by the throat but, even more so, a fan of tight writing. I know many people who love the details and all the inner monologue and thought that this book provides, but I'm not one of them. In fact, I found myself skimming a lot and still being able to follow the story. That said, this book is still a compelling and fascinating read and one I'd suggest any suspense or thriller lover to settle down with.
0205313426|4.0|This is a must read book if you need to self-edit your book or short story.<br />A very helpful book to have on your shelf.

B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish and it leaves me wanting to know more. Beautifully written with honesty and passion. It provides an invaluable insight into the reality of being Jewish in the third reich.
B0001FYPZU|5.0|Great great DVD!<br /><br />A must have!<br /><br />This is one of my favorites and of my son!<br /><br />Be sure to get the version that plays on the DVD player in this country.  I had to have the DVD changed...and how totally wonderful Amazon was about this.

B001DM1VXE|1.0|very confusing.  It seemed very pointless to me.  It seems to be very similar to the premise of the TV series &#34;Touch&#34;

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really enjoy playing this with my family. it is fun for all of us as we try to get the best reef.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The biggest compliment I can give this book was that the entire time, I felt like I was right there, first hand, watching and observing as the drama unfolded.  For a book that focuses on a single protagonist, it never became dull or uninteresting.  As a matter of fact there were moments where I literally felt my heart-rate jump in pivotal scenes, which honestly has never happened to me while reading a book like this.<br /><br />It really couldn't have been better unless it actually was a NASA documentary, kudos to Andy Weir on the superb novel.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Read for a book club - lots of discussion  - parenting, bullying, moral issues, - surprising ending<br />&#34;Light Between teh Oceans&#34;  gives a similar discussion
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Starts out super easy but gets more challenging as you go. Very attractive game with good background music. Chance for bonus packs with new materials. Would be cool if they added more puzzles in the future. Our whole family likes this game.
B005DJGMQE|2.0|Suspend for a moment all this discussion of the history that this film is supposed to revolve around. That \\"history\\" is almost immaterial to this film.  The more telling aspect of this film's quality is that American history is not really its source, but rather, Australian Film History.  This film is a poor remake of Bruce Beresford's \\"Breaker Morant\\" (1979).  The dialogue of the source movie is sometimes even reproduced.  The courtroom dynamics are nearly identical, with unreliable witnesses that the \\"green\\" but bright defense lawyer rips apart.  I suppose Redford was interested in transposing the story to an American context to create an allegory that would critique the Bush years and remind us all how willing we were (and still are) to trample the constitution for public appeasement.  So, fine, there is the producer's motivation, but, then it's his job to make the compelling allegory.  Yes, yes, we get it: the bloodlust for revenge, despite the fact that many people of the era HATED Lincoln (I'm not talking about Southerners--Lincoln was barely re-elected). So fine, there you have the making for ample political allegory, but it does not deliver.  It is too indebted to \\"Breaker Morant\\" and not really willing to break out from under its shadow.  In the end, it is what it is:  a fairly transparent remake of a foreign film.  I didn't think \\"Sommersby\\" (1993) was that good of a remake either [of \\"The Return of Martin Guerre\\" (1982)] but by comparison, \\"Sommersby\\" at least holds it own.  This film does not--sadly. Watch \\"Breaker Morant\\" instead: that's a hell of a film.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Hey, my AP calculus kids wanted to learn about relativity and non-Euclidean spacetime, so I used the episode where they got caught in a black hole to kick off the lesson.  It was worth it.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|So thrilling! I really like Dexter, definitely always leaves you on the edge of your seat. Dynamic characters, chilling plots.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|amazing awesome fun kinda time consuming real glitchy at times it also lags alot on my kindle but still really fun
B00BXI26XC|5.0|very good apps for checking the flight status, little bit difficult to understand as there are lot of setting ,but still ok
B008X8QCTO|4.0|For the cost this game gives you lots of puzzles to solve. Just when you thought you were getting close to end it gives you a whole new area to explore and solve more puzzles.  Nice mix of HO and regular puzzles that you have to the pieces to solve.  Not a difficult game just lots to do. I would of given it a 5 had not been for hangouts I kept getting with my kindle Fire. I would have to back out of the puzzle and then back to make it accept my clicks on objects,very frustrating.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This novel ties concepts from Lean Manufacturing and modern software development processes together. Initially, it confused me because it seems to be on operations management only, but soon I discover that it spans both development and operations, and doing so it hints at Continuous Delivery, Lean Startup, the importance of getting real-world feedback soon etc.<br /><br />Readers of this novel will probably want to read The Goal and The Gold Mine afterwards which I would recommend.<br /><br />If the authors need inspiration for their next book, here is my suggestion: Write a novel similar to The Phoenix Project but from the point of view of software developers, perhaps inspired by Eric Ries’ Lean Startup book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game. Nice strategy. Love the little helper. Wish it was longer for the free version. Wish there was more hidden items spots
B005LAIH2C|3.0|Switch off your brain, suspend any ideas you previously had about Hansel and Gretel and then you may just survive the movie. If I described the movie to you in 30 seconds or less then I would have completely covered the entire plot and saved you wasting 90 minutes of your life. The movie deserves 3 stars for the attempt to rewrite a classic, for the action and for the compulsory gratuitous nude scene. Had the actors been less wooden than the broomsticks and the story worthy of more than 30 seconds of attention I may have given it more. Please remove the swear words and cover the naked bottom so it can be rerated to a pg13 and then the appropriate aged audience could enjoy it.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|After reading one blog entry of James Altucher (can't pronouce the last name, but my husband who is fluent in German likes to say it the right way, but I prefer to harden all the sounds as possible, American style). I like short sentences and to-the-point style of writing with very little literary fluff to make it creative.  I don't like reading fiction.<br /><br />I find the book in a sort of conversation style, sometimes monologue-like and on the verge of preachy. . .but then James admits he doesn't always practice what he preaches, so I'm okay with the monologue.<br /><br />I'm \\"unemployed\\" and for a while I felt bad about that because people around me would tell me that I'm not \\"working\\", just because I wasn't hauling my ass to work everyday and partaking in the same drudgery. Its the crab syndrome where people around you like to pull you down if you try to escape the bucket with them.  I always felt they were just jealous. . .but most just can't see outside of the bucket they are in. Of course they don't know or chose to ignore the other life work I chose to do instead like follow my hobbies, manage my household, work side jobs and other non-traditional corporate ways to make money. After reading the James' book I feel a bit better about my life decisions to live the life I want to live.<br /><br />I do find it a bit scary the portions about the new society of permanent temporary workers because it unearths the security blanket that we have all been lead to believe in that \\"everything will be okay if you just work hard\\" attitude.  But I guess it's about expectations, as long as we are aware of the new world order, we won't be in shock when we see it happen.<br /><br />Since I don't have any friends that agree with me, it's nice to know that James has a huge following, so it means there is a populous out of like minded people.<br /><br />Haha, very interesting to read the poorly stared review. . .  I can see their points of view too.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This book certainly has me looking for more information on North Korea and the camps. However, I found the book to be somewhat poorly thought out and written for a \\"seasoned journalist\\" - I guess I expect better from such a person. Possibly these 'failings' are because the deadlines were too short and/or there was a rush to get it published once the labour intensive interviewing was done. I can certainly understand the work involved nuturing the relationship with Shin and getting past the language barrier. In spite of these factors, I would encourage people to get a sense of Shin's story and purchase this account of the camps, which are denied as existing by the North Korean government.
B00ACP3OOM|3.0|I love the way Finis supports their long time customers.  This has been a problem product, but you have to give them credit for trying.  This is finally reverting back to the great original 1 that held up the best in my opinion.  It was a blue brick at worn at the back of the head too.<br /><br />They need to make the firmware Mac updatable and work on the design to get the component to clip on the straps that are not a single flat but a dual bead style.  Occasionally in a butterfly or pushing hard off the wall, one of the component fly off.  This never happened with older designs.  Not sure why they put the clip upside down on the resonators.
B001NHN7TU|4.0|So many monster movies are ruined because the characters act like idiots.  In Termors, the characters think before they act, and that makes all the difference.  It's a lot of fun.
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|The same stuff we’ve heard before, just different packaging. (Eleven more impeccable words required by Amazon to submit this review)
B0013WJGJ0|4.0|I never believe for one minute that Michael Keaton is Batman, and Jack Nicholson, great actor though he is, can't come close to Heath Ledger as the Joker.  But Alfred is great; he is the center that holds the movie together, and the visual appeal of the movie overcomes all my objections to the logic, or lack of it, in the plot.
B000Q6GURU|3.0|I did not know what to expect from this film, and the jury is still out. Odd themes, but decent acting.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I could not find any number on the back of the watch to determine which instructions to follow to set date & day - never could get the right language to appear for the weekday - French (or German?) day would be in window rather than English.  The watch loses minutes.  I like the color, and the band.  The fit was good, too, but I have to reset every AM, and it slows down.  I think other reviewers mentioned that too, but thought I could get lucky.  Price was reasonable  , but I was disappointed I couldn't get the day/date function to work in my language.
030758836X|1.0|No spoilers here. Great book right up until the end.  The author basically wussed out of what needed to be done.  Totally unsatisfying. I'm sure the end is some high literary snarky twist that the literary elite loved, but this avid reader just wanted justice.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This item was brand new and some of Rods best music. So glad to find it at such a great price.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|Does anyone else out there hate how Amazon will pester you to rate something like a pencil ... anyway ... this Apple part works fine so far and the price was good. I suppose I should be grateful.
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|I love listening to the soundtrack while I'm patiently waiting for Season 4 to start. Nice mix, maybe a little too short.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I had my nose in this book until I finished it. Only came up for air when I had to attend other things. Don't want to give anything away.  This guy is a wonderful writer.  The book pulled your emotions in many different directions. Can't wait to read his next book! One problem, for me: Could have done with less of the F bombing.  Never will get used to that...oh well.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I must say, I was sadly disappointed in this novel. I am an avid fan of Khaled Housseini, but for me, his latest work is -- the only word that comes to mind --  is boring. I often skipped through sections as they were far too wordy for my taste, going on and on about things that were not important to me. The truth of the matter is, it was so boring that I did not even finish it. Sorry, Khaled, but you missed the boat on this one.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I love this new cd &#34;Time&#34;.  Rod gets back to his roots and pulls out the rock n roll.<br />He still sounds great after all these years.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Held my attention and was fun. Makes you actually think, unlike a lot of other games. Hoping they make a second one soon
0307352153|5.0|No matter where your innate personality falls on the continuum of introversion to extroversion, read this book. It is beautifully written, almost poetic. If you're an introvert who has fought against yourself for being &#34;different&#34; you will find this book, at the very least, validating, and, more likely, a balm for your soul. If you're an extrovert, reading this book will help you understand the others in your circle that you might currently see as &#34;weird but nice&#34;. Highly recommended.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Really opened my eyes how  people in other counties live.  I heard a speaker talk on these things that happen in India.  It is so hard to believe people can be so  evil. This is what happens when you take God  out  of peoples lives.  We in the US are heading down this road.  We took prayer out of our schools and now the schools are not safe for our children.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|This Anker USB battery pack has 2 output ports (5V 1A and 5V 2A).  It comes with a USB cable with several different attachments to fit most mobile devices.  Tapping the button turns it on and displays a power indicator of 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100%.  Tapping it again turns on a very bright flashlight which is handy.  The pack seems to hold a charge well and is good for several device charges.  Does what it's supposed to for a good price.

B006Y5H74W|5.0|I loved this show so much that I spent most of two nights awake on a Smash marathon after the kids were in bed.  Highly recommend especially for anyone in Theatre.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|I always have to order pizza to watch this. Great old movie from my childhood. Great action and a good message for the kids.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I purchased 4 pair since I wanted to stock-up on these type of Sony speakers, while still available. For me, ear-buds and over the ear speakers are not comfortable, but these fit like a glove on my small head size and are also adjustable. I find them to be as good as the Sony  in ear speakers I have had in the past. My only complaint is that they do fold-up. This makes it more difficult when you want to take them along with you.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Great story line, great visuals, love the message and the positivity of this movie. I have watched it a million times and it never gets old. I always notice something new and thoroughly enjoy it every time.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|I'd heard about this movie - but - never expected what I got ! It's well acted, quirky, funny and touching. I've been to the Ukraine and it has a haunting quality about it - exactly what comes through in the movie --- happy to own it.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I was reluctant to buy batteries on line, especially a such an inexpensive price. i was sure it was a ripoff. NOT SO. The batteries arrived sooner then the expected delivery time and they are just as advertised. I am very happy. I use them in my dogs no bark collar

B0061PEAUY|3.0|The TV show Bones had me picturing Temperance differently and the book did not provide good changes.  She was too unsure of herself.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|I heard Nightmare I just feel in love with it. Then listening to the other songs you get a true feel for their talents
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Much better than expected. Characters played parts well. Action sciences were cool. Witches even looked almost real, if that's what a witch is supposed to look like.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The actors/ actresses where fantastic. It was a sweet tale of falling in love for the \\" first \\" time & comical at the same time watching the akwardness of a zombie going against all odds. Cute movie. Wished it was longer :)
B00AB55BS0|3.0|Contrary to what's in the summary, the blu-ray discs in this set do NOT have Mandarin Chinese subtitles available.  It's very frustrating that I only found this out after buying the product.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|The older Simon & Garfunkel songs were the soundtrack for my teen years. I cry listening to them now.<br /><br />People don't understand that this collection of songs set off the World Music category. It couldn't have been done any better. Simon lets the African singers perform as they would at home. Their stunning rhythmic vocals really make the songs. Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes is an all time favorite. If you have looked at this CD and thought it was another folk rock album like earlier, you'd better pick it up and listen. It's comforting beyond all expectation.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It's probably reliable information because it was written by a neurosurgeon.  However I don't take it as proof for sure
0385334206|4.0|Plenty of laugh. Thought provoking. Still a fun read. Would recommend to someone who is not familiar with his work.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|This book is a distraction from everyday life and finally held my attention on a third try.  It's a frivolous story and not to be taken too seriously.
0679746048|4.0|Mental disorders have such an awful stigma attached to them. Those with disorders feel such shame like they must hide their health issue from society for fear they will be unjustly judged. It took courage to write a book about it. I wish more people would come forward and talk about their experiences without fear of backlash.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Enjoyed the storyline and puzzling. App slowed during several puzzles but other than that filled several hours with mind numbing game.
B000JVH78S|5.0|Highly recommend this book. If you aren't familiar with his work than I suggest starting off with this book. A great introduction into the mind of Vonnegut.
B00A88FLI0|3.0|A lot of very little pieces. Good for someone who can sit still for a long time and create something
0446310786|5.0|If you haven't had a chance to read this book please pick up a copy for yourself as soon as possible. I actually was dreading reading this book in high school, but when I finally got around to it I was instantly absorbed in the plot, characters, and was sad it ended. Great book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I have gotten hooked on this show and have been waiting and waiting for it to come out on Netflix.  Last week my husband looked into the Amazon option and lo and behold.....we get it for free because we have Amazon Prime.  Thank you Amazon!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book· Just wish the ending didn't leave you hanging the way it did· I love this series and would recommend it to everyone!
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The movie was worth the price just for the scenery alone....but the character in 'The Hobit&#34; were much more akin/like those in the book and folowed the story line more closely also....can hardly wait for the new movie about the dragon &#34;Smaug&#34;....
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I thought it was a lovely book, not too predictable, not too heavy.<br />Interesting in the light or autism and Aspergers becoming more and more diagnosed in our society now days.<br />The story was very moving and the protagonists inability to see himself as other saw him was intriguing.<br />Perfect for a holiday :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy the interactions between the staff and the residents of the house.  I particularly enjoy the romance with Mr. Bates.

B005H9B44A|3.0|The story has the usual theme but overall a bit shallow. it had some sparks though. These last words are for the amazon word requirement.

B009Y7YC2M|2.0|tried running what I recorded. No luck, so far.  Downloaded to Kindle Fire HD. What??? And they really want five more words?
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This is just the same old story (boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl) with the &#34;quirky&#34; addition that both girl and boy are crazy.  I do not understand why what's-her-name got the Oscar...she just chewed the scenery and yelled a lot.  I think she was much bette -n &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;  (see that one!).  A one-trick-pony movie that got the buzz because it was not a franchise (like Superman, Fast and Furious, etc.); not too many &#34;one off&#34; movies these days so the critics went overboard.  So it goes.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|really enjoyed this sci fi action drama from bbc america. totally original, fast pasted couldn't wait to see the next epsisode and looking forward to season 2
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Some reviews for this movie were not so great at first but they improved so I decided to give it a try. For the genre, this movie is much better than I anticipated.<br /><br />Characters: Fun, actors are great.<br /><br />Storyline: For this type movie, not bad. This movie kept my attention from beginning to end. It's about Hansel and Gretel, witch hunters. They finally encounter a big bad witch with a bunch of minions that take a little more effort than usual to kill which makes up 75% of the movie. The plot thickens and intertwines giving it a lot more depth and character development.<br /><br />Action: Lots of it from beginning to end. Neat fight scenes and weapons. This movie is somewhat fast paced.<br /><br />Bad language: Yep, there are a few bad words. Mostly the \\"F\\" word a few times but maybe a half dozen times at most.<br /><br />Graphics/Special Effects: Pretty good, I enjoyed them. In my opinion, nothing looked cheesy, cheap nor \\"B\\" rated. Everything looked real and I never felt the makers did a poor job. (One reviewers said something about seeing wires, I never saw any)<br /><br />Costumes/Makeup: Very good. Again, nothing cheap, cheesy nor \\"B\\" rated. Some of the witches had interesting makeup.<br /><br />There are people exploding, getting shredded, getting their heads blown off, hanged, burned and eating bugs. However, they don't dwell on such scenes and its not too graphic for squeamish people. No kids get killed.<br /><br />If you are looking for something fun to watch, this movie delivers especially if you like these type movies. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. 4 stars.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Having read his other books I could not wait to read this one. However, I felt a bit let down. The story is told ftom several angles, but it feels somewhat disconnected. A nice read, but I preferred the kite Runner and a thousand splendid suns. Much stronger stories!
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Superior acting by all about the cutthroat real estate business. Pacino, Spacey, Harris, Arkin and Lemmon were AMAZINGin this movie!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is actually like you have your own horse. you must groom feed and clean up his or her stall. have fun playing this game hope you like it
B00BSBXA98|5.0|I didn't expect anything less from this movie and yet, I was amazed once again by the Cirque Du Soleil
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I got the game and it works like a real piano why spend $150.00 rollers for a real won at the store so cool
B0027MJU00|4.0|Waiting for Gillian Flynn to write more, quickly!  I liked this better than Girl Gone but not quite as much as Sharp Objects.  Flynn's character development is outstanding and her storytelling unpredictable and riveting.  My only complaint is that she's got me hooked on mysteries, but I can't find another writer I like nearly as well!
B0091REZMW|1.0|I lost all my progress,  all my friends, every item and challege I completed. All the money I spent on diamonds was wiped out. I complained and got no response. Huge rip off. I'm very disappointed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Just like playing on the IPAD or computer.  Haven't discovered any issues with the game as yet.  Fun and entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game and very fun to play. can be slow at times but overall I recommend it for any's users who like animals .
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I recently visited Guernsey & had to read the book. It made me laugh & cry & long for friends like the ones I made between the covers of this story.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|We'll first off  Tower Heist is a  great movie directed by Brett Ratner, also known for Rush Hour. I recommend this movie, it's good comedy...
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|It's a good game.  I've played 100's of these type games, and this one is good, but I have played better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandson loves this game and so do I! It's fast paced, fun and the monkey monster is frightening even though we realize it's not real.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled<br /> I don't remember when was the last time I enjoyed any book so much. I laughed, I was entertained, I swooned. Tangled, book with witty and sarcastic hero as narrator, is a MUST READ! This insight into man's head and thinking is fascinating and a lot of fun.<br /> I loved \\"the voice\\" and style of writing in this book. It was magical, sarcastic, witty and funny. Perfection if you like to read something entertaining with well-thought storyline development and sexy hero. I just completely adored Drew's inner thoughts and they were pretty hilarious too. I have never read about cockier hero than Drew Evans. But you will fall for him anyway, he is just that awesome. I personally will never forget him.<br /> I loved the chemistry between Drew and his Kate. They argued, they bickered, they flirted, and it was great to read. I loved the verbal foreplay, and I was just waiting for that charming womanizer to get knocked out by love. Not only is this a sweet and sexy read, with some very sigh-worthy romantic moments, and some great grovelling as well, this story is also incredibly funny, the kind of laugh-out-loud funny that makes people ask you what you're reading over there<br /> Emma Chase really pulled the male POV off and I will be eagerly awaiting her next book.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I was surprised at how much fun this series is!  The entertainment industry has a dismal record for adequately dramatising books, and this one takes a whole lot of liberties, but their diversions didn't make me want to throw a brick at the tv.  for a change.<br />It should be rated WTMUN21 (Way Too Much Unnecessary Nudity, for ages 21up)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I must say that I like the story.but I think there are a lot of charters I get confused sometimes.other than that it is a very good story.i love the writing.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love this cd.  IZ's rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow is simply beautiful!  All tracks are wonderful as well.  I have a renewed appreciation of Hawaiian music.
B000ME5B30|5.0|This movie was a class assignment that I was required to watch otherwise I still would have never heard of it.<br /><br />I am very impressed with Al Gore because of his work towards this project,  though this cannot be considered just a project but instead a total overhaul of the way is Americans are living.<br /><br />It sincerely concerns me that not enough of the right people are listening so that direction can come from the top.  But as he did,  if anyone admits to the issue,  they will also have to take ownership toward the effort.  And unfortunately too many politicians are too concerned about their own agendas.<br /><br />In a sense America is sadly not only proverbially going up in smoke, but also literally.  Brings to light a different meaning to the term \\"melting pot\\".  Hmm... is not just culturally, is it?
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I was expecting tongue in cheek hilarity and was not disappointed. But their was also a touching and meaningful side to the book that was unexpected. Thoroughly enjoyable at multiple levels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could NOT put this book down. Started off a bit slow, but turned out to be exciting and thrilling. A must read.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|I Paid for app, but get nothing but &quot;internal service error&quot;. What a waste. How do I get a refund?
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|had a lot of potential with an interesting setup in kansas in black & white before he gets to oz...but, once he gets to oz the film falls apart. why? first, a number of roles were miscast, starting with james franco and mila kunis. neither had the charm or range to make us believe they actually believed they were these characters. second, the visual effects looked surprisingly on the cheap side, particularly when there were close-ups of the actors in these unique worlds.  compare the effects in this film to ALICE and it's not close for some reason. last, though there are adult topics in the film, it plays way too much towards kids...which kind of makes it tough to watch if you aren't watching with kids.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love the puzzles.  Some things you might add are the ability to decrease the size of the preview to keep it out of the way but still visible and for people with poor vision to change the color of the background to help with contrast.
B00CHILW64|3.0|visually, the film was very powerful. lots of great sequences. the actor performances were quite good. naomi watts played a role we haven't seen her play before. on the negative side, it's a very intense film both graphically and physically. we are exposed to lots of blood and cut open body parts and such. maybe it just caught us on a bad night but i can think of better ways to spend an evening in rather than watching natural disaster torture.
B00CFQMVLS|4.0|We all became such Die Hard Fans through the last two decades that we forget that both we and Bruce Willis have grown older than we would like to accept. I think that Willis has shown us this in this hopefully final installment of his Die Hard Series. I am proud to say that he did so with a style and grace that he should be proud of. My only hope is that financial needs or some overzealous producers do not ruin his proud ending by talking him into doing another. It would be as sad as the last fight of Mohamed Ali.<br />In conclusion, this movie was well done but fell short of what Die Hard fans have come to expect. If another was to be made it would have to be named DIE SLOW!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|If you have not read Kate Morton....Please try her<br />books.  I have already read 3 of her books and looking<br />forward to her new book...
B00CDCIQX6|2.0|I am still waiting to get up enough boredom to have the desire to finish watching this movie. I hated the beginning, I hated the middle , so I have no doubt I will hate the end. Sometimes artists become lost in their craft to the displeasure that films are supposed to be made for audience enjoyment and not for the pleasure or acceptance of other artists. If there was anything entertaining about this film it was not for us stupid people. But unfortunately we are the ones who blindly pay to watch. I wish we could demand refunds!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love it for recipes and gardening tips.  I can keep up on many subjects I enjoy.  Many of the subjects make me laugh.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|This movie would have been more appropriate if it was about Arnold himself. He went from Body Builder, To Actor, To Politics, to Govenor, to Maid Lover, and back to Actor. I think he was happiest as the maid lover, but no one else was. The movie was just as confusing as his life. In fact, I can't even remember what it was about. If you get the chance to watch it, could you tell me?
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|My four year old like  playing it but it's hard to get very far. My advice is don't waste your diamonds. You will need to pay a lot for diamonds to make  the game more fun.
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|This movie must have been produced by someone who missed their childhood bedtime story telling. Their parents were probably Yuppies who read too many foolish training manuals about how to raise children and forgot to love and nurture them! The overwhelming departure from purity of this story was replaced with a bundling of movies bent on discovering how many different ways to kill somebody set in an olden time back round. This was an attempt to make the special effects take the place of interesting content. It would have been better if the witch had cooked them and eaten them.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I grew up watching The Wizard of Oz, so I was so excited for this movie. Storyline is great, special effects are amazing. Must see movie!
B00821OX98|2.0|The alien invasion stems out into friendly aliens, mean aliens, contemlplative aliens, and humans who screw each other over, pine for their children, become power mongers, and find love at the dark end of the street.<br />Been there, done that so many times there are more yawns than awe.<br />Besides, if you want to see all the plot contrivences listed above, just attend one daily session of the US congress.
B008VBYN80|5.0|this is one of the best pe game that I have played entell I got minecraft! I like the fighting part about it!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I  WOW!  because I can!  Sometimes what fits doesn't meet the literary standards of a New York Times review.  Sometimes WOW! just puts in right there.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the actors, an encapsulated view of a small neighborhood with big heart.  I am a romantic.  I understand human frailties and what pain we can suffer in our losses of the heart.<br />But, life has a silver lining.  You just have to believe in that, and look for it.  If you are lucky, it will find you.<br />Alan
B00CWY76CC|5.0|sometimes it can get a little confusing and you get frustrated, but it's easier than it looks lolz. that is all thanks :)
B004J713JW|5.0|But know, now that I've seen this concert on DVD, I WILL be seeing Billy Joel in person as soon as he starts touring again. I love the addition of various artists and the large orchestra! Fantastic!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I choose this rating because it is awesome<br />and I can text my friends if they want to hang out.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|just what you need to make an impulsive buy or check the price before you buy at a brick and mortar store.
B0031RS44S|5.0|This is full of action and adventure and a hint of romance. One of the best I have read by this author.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very user friendly prints are are large and it also has bookmarks and highlights which makes it easy to use
B004EPYZUS|5.0|On par with other action movies, especially the 007 Series. My favorite Mission Impossible yet, can not wait for more!
B008C20TDG|5.0|Love all the science behind this book.  It isn't just a \\"what not to eat book\\". It explains to you why we crave the foods we crave and backs it up with all the science behind it.  Makes perfect sense why we should eat primal vs. the all process frankenfoods of modern days.  I have been recommending this book to everyone!
B0000669JL|5.0|This s an excellent DVD compilation of some of Marley's best songs. No woman no cry,Get up, stand up are just two my faves, I kinda wish song writers today would take a leave from him, and write as they see the times. These lyrics will forever stand true, and strong! A real Prophet!
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|When you hear John's voice you can't help but remember the great hits by CCR.  Unique sound but most rememberable.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|A fan of MJ for years, my original album broke do I decided to go with the CD, I always loved a thriller, and I believe is one of his finest work
B00CW665VI|5.0|I'm serious. Stop reading this review. You don't need to weigh this decision. Just buy the book and read it already. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />This is the kind of book you read and go 'Damn, I wish I could write like that'. It's sweet and hilarious and sexy. Drew is a fantastic POV character. Kate is just...<br /><br />Why are you still reading this review? You're wasting time. BUY THIS BOOK. READ IT. THE END.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Good movie! Didn't get the opportunity to see it at theaters, so not to bad. Nice to know that Amazon has videos one can watch online.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I find it very relaxing. you have to give it your total consintration. I enjoy it if I am stressed. its fun to see how high a score you can get.
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|These guys are the real deal.  They sound like a combination of The Doors and Led Zeppelin. Damn near every song on Head Down is a \\"hit.\\"  Download the whole album and listen to every song in order.  You won't be disappointed, and you'll find yourself wanting to listen to it over and over again.  Rival Sons and their album, Head Down, is a sure bet.  Had they released their album one month later, we would be seeing them at the 2014 Grammys for sure.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm so addicted to this game. I love it and never get bored. I liked the first temple run a lot when it first came out, but this one is so much better.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Its an ok action movie. The acting is decent and costuming is original. Light and fun. Kid friendly with no cursing.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|Every season gets better and better. This product was as described. I didn't realize it would include DVD and Blu-ray, but that was a nice surprise.
B000HL09MG|1.0|I was enjoying watching movies when all of a sudden when I rented this one, my pc wouldn't play the movies anymore. I updated drivers, Google Chrome, scanned for malware and a few other &#34;fixes&#34; etc. etc. that I got from other sources since Amazon doesn't offer clients any help whatsoever and the blogs is stupid with no moderators. So um...yeah when you want to actually be of some help I would appreciate it, but based on previous complaints which are all over the web I am not expecting any AND I will NOT be renewing my membership without some real customer service.I have no problems watching all sorts of videos on You Tube, and other sites...so what's the DEAL?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I so enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down.  This is one of my favorite authors and I recommend this book as well as A Thousand Splendid Suns and Kite Runner.  Well written, never a dull moment and I didn't have a clue which path it would follow at any given moment.  Although I wanted more (not wanting it to end), I loved  the way it ultimately did end.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I read all the reviews before getting this one and they were all positive. I'll just add my name to that list! This is one cute, fun game and I loved it! I agree with the comparison to Super Mario and that is one of the big reasons I like it so much. Get this today!
0374533555|5.0|This is a fascinating look at how we think and make decisions.  Should help anyone in decision making role or role of influence.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this new new season! The producer has done an amazing job with revamping the story for a modern day Sherlock and Watson. Love the Actors-- perfect for the parts!
B009MO5E10|5.0|This is a movie about a bad cop and a guy who thwarts his evil plans.  But there's too much bicycle riding in it.  It seems like every other scene has at least one person riding on a bicycle.  Sometimes there are three or four and (spoiler alert!) at the end there are a whole BUNCH of bicycle riders circling the bad cop.  Usually, someone is chasing someone else, and the person being chased is on a bicycle.  Why always a bicycle?  People could be chased while driving a car, and many movies have had such scenes in them.  Maybe if they varied it up a bit- make people chase each other on ATVs through a swamp, or on foot through a crowd or something.  While I'm not opposed to bicycles altogether, it hardly makes sense to have an entire movie about riding them.  The rest of the plot was pretty good.  The good guy helps someone out, gets his girlfriend to love him even more, and thwarts the evil plans of a really bad cop.  What more do you need than that?  Certainly not bicycles.<br /><br />My verdict: Great Movie! (But too much bicycle riding)<br /><br />P.S. Not to be picky, but the ENTIRE MOVIE takes place in New York City.  A little more variety would have been nice.  They could have shot scenes in Trenton, NJ or a generic small town in the middle of Texas.  Of course, to get there you'd have to drive something other than a bicycle, so there's your reason.  Sigh.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game I would like to be able to afford to buy them all or at least be able to go further
B0063IH60K|1.0|I have this app on several IOS devices w/o the adds and really like it, but I can`t accept the obnoxious pop up adds every time a game is completed. Hopefully a version w/o the adds will be available soon and I can re-install the app.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Awesome.  Can't wait to see these guys live.  They are up there with the best.  I have all of their albums.  They jam.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This amazingly well written and easy to read book highlights the efforts, abilities, and acumen of Lincoln in a way that exposes on and illuminates his towering abilities..
B000FBGBPC|5.0|These guys put some great music together.  Great for the car commute.  If you like hard rock and metal give 3 Days Grace a listen.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Another Spielberg/Abrams great movie. Definitely one that you can watch over and over again. There is always a wonderful message in Spielberg's movie and this one does not disappoint!
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush.  They are a band that defines a brand of Rock that has set the tone for many other great Rock bands that have followed.  They are good in concert too.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Have fun every day with this game. Only problem is it is addicting!!! Fun to compete with your friends & family. Tips: save up your points & gold. Don't use them as soon as you get them. Can make much bigger scores if you are patient & let your points build up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Lots of fun not too difficult.  Good exercise for  your brain. Hopefully they will have more rooms soon.
B00594XOZU|3.0|On the Windows Phone it doesn't alert you to new messages. Not to mention you can't be signed in on your phone and tablet at the same time. Needs improvement.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I understand that the book is a work of fiction, yet, it is hard to estimate how much is inspired by truth and how much by propaganda. As such no one really knows anything that goes on in North Korea. One thing is for sure, the Pulitzer Prize is a political favour. By no means is this book a good piece of fiction.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was well-written - I actually felt that I was there - one of the characters.  I could not put it down...  Just a wonderful read!
B007IK44CK|4.0|I enjoyed Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. The story line was good, the pace was good, and Tom Cruise did a good job with the acting. I am looking forward to the next installment.
159562015X|3.0|This book  offers a lot of great insight as to determining ones personal strengths.  Definitely would recommend giving it a try.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a great read! Not hard to get into and all about the details and twists! Definitely keeps you ready for more.
B00005JO9J|4.0|When people and critics talk about Grey's Anatomy they always make references and comparisons to another great show, ER, but in my opinion these shows couldn't be any more different. Basically seeing these kids turn into adults this show really gives us a chance to get to know these characters by slowing down time and showing these interns, residents, attendings and even the chiefs emotions to each case. Narrated by the self-absorbed, but loveable Meredith Grey you really get insight to how these new additions to Seattle Grace Hospital manage their jobs and their personal lives at the same time. Watching this two disc dvd you will almost certainly love the tough but compassionate Dr.Bailey, women will swoon for the insanely handsome Dr.Shepard, badmouth the talented but crass Dr.Alex Karev, root for George and Izzies friendship, Christina and Burkes relationship, and of course Meredith and Dereks central one as well. While not always having original storylines, this is a great start to a new show.
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|I really enjoyed this Francis Coppola adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker. It had humor and some great cameos and Damon & DeVito had good chemistry, well worth watching
0307950689|4.0|Silly me, I forgot that I bought and read this a couple of years ago.  I thought it was new. The story is interesting, especially about what is in Washington, the buildings, societies, etc.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|The chemistry of Portman & Kutcher was believable. The movies had some funny moments and some very painful ones. Overall for this type of movies is was fair.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|the movie was slow. not as funny as I expecting ,the son wasn't that great of an actor. just  really slow
B001V5CIFI|3.0|I love Emma Thompson, but I didn't care for this movie; her appearance was depressing and the kids were horrible - although I have to say I didn't finish it, so it may have gotten much better.  It didn't compare to Mary Poppins.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very fun and addicting. Great graphics, plays well on kindle fire no problems.  Better than most of the freebies.  Liked it so well I bought the Full game.
0316123587|5.0|I love the yearbook. It's a lot of fun reading and watching it. Love the coach Sue Sylvester and the amazin little Barbra Streisand (Rachel Berry).<br /><br />If you love GLEE, the Glee Cast, The New Directions, or the whole serie you should buy it!<br /><br />100% recomended!
B00821OX98|3.0|Could use good writers. Maybe the show will get better when it starts making more money. I've always liked SciFi & Fantasy stuff.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter has always loved My Little Pony so when she saw this app she wanted it.  She plays it everyday and talks to the Kindle like she's talking to the ponies.
0060191325|5.0|Great book I have learned so much. Wow incredible just when I thought I knew everything about women I didn't know anything lol. This book is a must read.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is very relaxing and it helps my youngest go to sleep.  We usually have soft music on so the kids will calm down at bedtime and it's not very long after I turn it on that he is sleeping. Thank you.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Wonderful design and, gameplay. Reminds me of Diablo and the older genre of the earlier styles of dungeon slasher games. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys some simplicity in their games and like fantasy.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I love the way technology gets more advanced.  This will definitely help to check the answers when my daughter gets older to do harder fractions.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The book was a continuation of the story, and it read well, but I would like some closure for the characters other than violent death, and it would be nice to see some conclusions before Mr. Martin stops writing so we as readers can see his vision for this series. I liked it as I liked the other books!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My son is into sharks and he really likes this game.  He is always laughing and making sound effects when he plays this game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Although the book was fiction, the author made it so realistic with all the details.  The story touched my heart and I plan to read the book again.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My son likes this game because he likes chopping the fruit in half. Its kind of addicting.  He's better at it than I am.
B00AEUPOVQ|3.0|Too slow for my liking.  I try such movies every so often and most of them I can't get through them.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I like these actors and seeing them playing many roles each is cool, but the movie doesn't do any of them justice.  Very confused editing and unnecessarily crude. A movie without a plan.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tesla has always fascinated me. His was a much more interesting mind than Edison. Isn't it interesting that the government snatched up all of his papers & such when he died?
1433502445|5.0|I really liked it.  It will help me get more out of reading it and understand it better. It puts it in simple form to understand.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I really like this game. I like smashing the bad guys and I can't wait for more levels. When will they be ready?<br /> I really like
B00932A4XE|4.0|I have been wanting to see this for the longest but never quite did until it was on Prime instant videos and it was a fun movie.  If you feel like a relaxing upbeat movie, this is for you.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I downloaded this for my kids and then found out you have to pay to go beyond level 2. All the same, I love it, and $2.99 wasn't too much to buy the full version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love being able to see all the creative ideas from other more crafty than myself! Love the site. Love how it is integrated with multiple social media sites too.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|What a treat this collection is.  I have fallen, face first for their rendition of 1,000 years. Lots of passion in their work.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is the best read EVER! It is a funny book.  I don't know what else to say so umkay bye
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Lived up to my expectations.  Beautiful collection, and andre's voice is clear, lovely.  One of his best collections, I love it.
B00110K62U|5.0|It is fabulous.  I really enjoyed it very much,  I have the 25th anniversary and enjoy it too.  I wish they would come out with a video of the play
B00338QENI|5.0|I work as an administrator in a research department at a federal facility and this book was further verification that we, as a society, have come far in our dealings with patients/subjects and informed consent.  I had heard about the HeLa samples, but did not know any of the details of the living person and her family.  I feel ashamed at the way Henrietta and her family, and countless others, were treated as lab rats, but that shame is erased when I attend our review board meetings and witness first hand how we protect patients/subjects now.  I recommend this book to EVERYONE who is involved with research.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I think if I had not seen the play I would have enjoyed the movie more.  I have seen the play about 4 times and would go see it again.  I can't say the same for the movie
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I believe that the best movies are usually over 2 hours, but I also believe that some movies would be better shorter
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I ended up returning this and buying an E17 instead. The form factor was nice but and the sound was decent but there wasn't a lot of control or options. If you are going to get a headphone amp I would suggest going for one of the better FiiO models.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I've used other apps, and this is the best one by far. I've always had trouble with others, but this works exactly as promised.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read it through rather quickly. This book had me coming back for more. Will definitely be reading the rest of the trilogy. Also love the kindle lending library idea. Just wish that it wasn't limited to one book a month as read at least two.
B005SAZFWK|5.0|I watched this because of a review that Jesse Eisenberg gave about it on NPR. I was not disappointed. I'm quite sure I'll watch it again.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is one of those books where the title and the book's description on Amazon (or whatever source you use) really do a horrible job making you want to read the book...even though it's really good (a la 11/22/63 and The Fault in our Stars). A good friend of mine recommended Flowers to me and she told me to completely ignore the description and just trust her - and she was right! You don't have to be especially interested in flowers to enjoy the story - as someone who used only white tulips at her wedding mainly because they were easy and cheap, I clearly don't have much interest in flowers!<br /><br />This is really a book about a lost soul who mistrusts the world trying to find meaning in her life. It's also a love story - both romantic love and motherly love. I wouldn't call this book a Page Turner, but it is definitely suspenseful and I couldn't wait to find out what fallout had happened between Elizabeth (one of Victoria's previous foster mothers), Catherine (Elizabeth's estranged sister), and Victoria.<br /><br />Flowers and the language of flowers (a Victorian way of communicating emotions through flowers) really just surround the deeper themes. And, I even found myself becoming a bit interested in the language of flowers - it was kind of cool finding out what emotions various kinds of flowers represent (one of my favorite flowers, hydrangea, means \\"dispassion\\" - bad choice apparently!!).<br /><br />There were moments when I got incredibly frustrated with Victoria and her inexplicable actions (I don't want to spoil the story, so I won't elaborate much here), but I guess this is to be expected from a character coming out of the foster care system who mistrusts the world.<br /><br />This would be a great selection for Book Clubs.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love using this case to charge my Voyager Lengend it's so easy to do and charges real good.  To me its easier to use without having to use the microUSB cable cord all the time and the case holds its charge for a few days.  Really the only time that you would use the microUSB cable cord is when the case needs to be charged but other than that I love it.  The case is 4 1/4 L x 2 1/2 W x 1/2 H with a see thru top and with a solid black bottom.  I purchased this charger case in Nov 30, 2012 and still working very nicely.  Thank you for a great product!!!
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Is it graphic? Is it  brutal? Is is shocking? Yes, yes, and yes -- but from the first time I saw this, quite a while ago, I just though it was sad.  When she finally eats that crap they feed her, it just breaks my heart; after all she endures, that one little capitulation seems so tiny and insignificant but at that moment you know all her fight is gone and her spirit is totally broken.  It is one if my all-time favorite movies and I think it is one if the most heartbreaking and beautiful movies I have ever seen.  Do not miss it, in another director's hands, it would be exploitative.  Instead, this just breaks your heart.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is even better than the first, try it you'll like it.  There's more detail and action than the first.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My son and I loved this movie, I'm a huge video game fan, and I Can't wait for a sequel.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|The only thing I would really like to see with this is when you are playing a two player game, I would like to actually be able to sit across the table from someone, instead of having to hand the Kindle back and forth to each other.
B000OV85AW|5.0|Best movie Steve McQueen ever did!!  This was based on the real life account of Henri Charriere from his book of the same name. Steve McQueen was riveting as Papillon, a man who was wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in prison at the infamous Guiana French prison commonly known as the Devil's Island.  No one had ever escaped (alive) from this island.  He endured incredible hardships while there including spending 7 years in solitary - 6 months of it in total darkness with half rations for not giving the officials the name of the person (Dustin Hoffman's character) who was sneaking coconuts into him so he wouldn't get scurvy. Dustin Hoffman plays a man touted as the biggest embellezer in the history of France.  One of the best movies ever made with Steve McQueen giving one of the best performances ever given in a movie to date.

B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first Hunger Games I had to move on to Catching Fire IMMEDIATELY. This book really kept the pages turning for me and it had just as many of the twists and turns that Hunger Games had.
0061808121|5.0|I hadn't read it for a long long time and it was even more well written than I remembered.  The CD was read by Sissy Spacek.  What a good voice, terrific.  I recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the previous two books and this one did not disappoint. There is plenty of action and twists and turns to keep you turning pages!
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|was wonderful.  just as amazing on dvd as in person. take grandchildren to as many shows as I can.  we enjoyed it together when the came to visit!

B001XUH69Y|5.0|There are a few movies that just get better with age. This is one of those few. I could watch it again right now and still see new things.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i think the writing of this book is good.  i just found myself completely despising almost everyone in the book and that made it hard to keep reading.
B005LAII62|5.0|My five-year-old and I ADORE this movie.  She's a spooky girl who loves horror flicks, just like Norman, so she immediately identified with the main character.  There were enough smart, more mature jokes to make me laugh and enough silliness to keep her laughing, too.  There wasn't a single aspect of this movie I didn't enjoy.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have not watch this DVD collection yet, but it did arrive when said it would. A very good condtion
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|We rented this last night for our date night and the quality was terrible.  I usually don't have trouble with movies, but this one was really pixely sometimes to the point where I couldn't tell what was going on.  I just updated my internet connection so I don't think that was it.  I'm really disappointed that I couldn't enjoy the movie more.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Best movie ever every twilight fan should own<br />I wish they had more extended scenes<br />Some scenes in book should of been added please buy and enjoy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game and a great way to pass the time away. Keep up the good work decolletes!!
B00A3OT34M|5.0|Very good music.. keeps a body moving... which pitbulls music never fails to do. Been listening to his music before he became somebody.
1601251505|5.0|Still currently reading through it , and also am completely new to the RPG tabletop scene but I gotta say for what I get out of this is a lot more than most books you'd find from any other franchise. It has everything you need as a player or gm in a nice package , and spans about 500+ pages. Now would I recommend this to those who are like me who haven't touched DnD or have no idea what 3.5 means? No , I recommend 4th Editions for those who are Just starting out but if you're crazy or bold enough to take the bull by the horns and want to cut your teeth on something , Pathfinders for you.
B00AQCMK32|2.0|This game has a very annoying glitch where on the kindle fire not hd when you open up a letter it gives you a error message and you have to close the hole game down it gets very annoying.

0792163710|3.0|My brother had wanted a copy of this film for a long time--one of his favorites; he is thrilled to have it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am glad to read the truth about the raid that killed Osama.  This should be read by all Americans.  It should be read in schools, to learn what true American heroism is about.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is now my favorite book, its so good and I could barely put it down. I put amazing. because that's exactly what it was no further reasoning. I recommend this book to everyone,I truly believe that everyone will love it as much as I did.<br />It's an amazing book!
B0019IB0II|3.0|Interesting and informative but too repetitive. The book could have been cut by about a quarter and still have the same information.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|For a free game, it's definitely worth it. But some things just don't make sense. For example, to unlock the next stage you have to get to a certain XP level. The 4 classes are definitely  better than the ones in Dungeon Hunter 3, as are the graphics. This game also has a storyline to it that doesn't change based on your class, which saddens me :(  Other than that, it's definitely worth it.
0385536828|1.0|Maybe it is time to rethink the so called greatness of Mr. McEwan...living on one's reputation is the ultimate trickery and I think that this is what this book is a trickery and a great deception .
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is the best APP i've downloaded on my Kindle Fire HD so far.  It's really cool to think of someone and try to beat the genie, 100 times so far and i've only stumped him 3 times.
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|The movie was slightly different than the book but nonetheless it had a great storyline. I would highly recommend watching it.
B00C5GZKVQ|3.0|The game looks good but the controls are something to be desired.  It can be fun for a short time but not much longer than that.
0679805273|5.0|I added additional famous quotes to the book and gave it to my nephew who is going to law school.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|This movie is so very good Edward norton is a great actor you need to see this movie American History X
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Reading Amy's journal entries give you a chance to get to know a truly multi-faceted character. What you see...is NOT what you get!
B005S9ELVC|4.0|The movie begins by saying \\"inspired\\" by actual events.  Someone got really inspired because almost nothing portrayed in this film happened as shown.  Ok, so the facts have been changed to protect the innocent.  What difference does that make?  Well, it wouldn't make any difference, except that the true story of Mickey Cohen and Chief Parker is far more interesting than than this simple cops and robbers story.  Parker is shown (barely) as a model of virtue and Mickey Cohen, who apparently charmed the pants off of everyone from Bugsy Segal to Billy Graham is shown as a standard movie psychopath.  Along the way, people are killed who didn't actually die and the end is more like Sands of Iwo Jima than what really happened.<br /><br />Other than a lack of complexity to the characters and the overall fiction of the story, Gangster Squad is beautifully shot, well acted and occasionally cleverly written.  It is way better than Mulholland Falls which is another take on the same story but more of a downer.  As an afterthought, a true period piece would not have shown the violence so graphically but again, this is strictly a modern day retelling of a story that never happened.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed accompanying Harold Fry on his walkathon through the English countryside. I like the way that the deeper reason for his undertaking the pilgrimage is revealed gradually, through the book.
B00D3V5V7U|3.0|First off, the production is very, very good.  Airy in this day & age of thick walls of in-your-face abuse - the songs breathe and are dynamic.  The guitar & bass tones are smashing, Brad Wilk's drumming is spot on and Ozzy's vocals sound good.  But overall, well, for 13 years' wait, it just seems so very average.  Hopefully it's a start and we get one or two more out of the gentlemen.  If we're lucky, this is just a reintroduction to Sabbath and what they could be.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a great gun simulation and is pretty accurate. Very fun to play during long car rides.<br />I can not wait for more weapons!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in the past year and the best of his three novels.  I thoroughly enjoyed his previous two novels and would give them five stars.  Khaled Hosseini provides insight into the Afghan people and culture and effectively brings out the differences in our cultures but also shows the similarities we have a human beings.  He was able to weave the story with different people and show their relationships to each other.  It's a book that is difficult to put down and I did not want it to end.  For those who have an interest in Afghanistan or have served or will serve in Afghanistan I strongly recommend this book as required reading.  Hosseini is a master story teller who has effectively shown the differences between our western culture and the Afghan culture and the challenges many people in Afghanistan face.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|great game overall but game needs to be cheaper. still my favorite out of them all. very complex for app. but exciting
B009AJD5E0|1.0|For all the money spent on this film you'd think that they'd at least have gotten an original story and a decent scriptwriter. This movie is absurd on just about any level, even the CGI animates absurd equipment.<br />Very glad my viewing was thanks to a free HBO preview w/e, I'd have been truly upset had this cost me more than a few electricicles.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is the best know I have a ton of diamond swords and I made a house out of iron and my house underground is made of diamond I know that anyone with the app minecraft pocket edition would want this app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game! Not too easy, sometimes it is actually a little too hard.  Don't expect to power through this game without needing assistance from a walk through- or three. Looking forward to future updates. Hopefully, I'll be able to do them without help.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I thought this movie did an excellent job of feeling like the original.  It was very funny, and you felt like you were watching an Oz movie the entire time.  I think James Franco did a great job.  My only real issue was that in the second half Mila Kunis was a bit over the top for me, it was distracting.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|These guys were my favorite band in high school. All of their songs were very powerful and had phenomenal vocals. While some of the songs on here are very good, a lot of them just sound kind of plain. They dont have that effect of raising the hair on your arms with each song in this album. I kind of just listened through it once or twice, listened to a few songs i really liked afterwards, then forgot about it. :/
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|Lots of the 1 star reviews of this product seem to focus on the Disney's decision about how to market the home version.  I may return to that topic if characters remain, but in main this will be a review of what IS in the box, and of the movie itself.<br /><br />First off, it's beautiful.  The 3D SFX were nicely done in IMAX and the Blu-ray transfer looks good.  Oz is colorful as ever you'd wish, and even on the main menu screen, things come out of the screen in a quite satisfactory way.  There is a bit of ghosting in some of the bright against dark scenes, but probably less than in the average transfer.<br /><br />So, on to the story (no spoilers if you've seen all the trailers).  We have to face it - Gregory Maguire owns this space, and if you've visited the Wickedverse part of your mind will be expecting Theodora and Evanora to be Elphaba and Nessarose and, well, they're not.  Nor could they be.  Maguire's sex and politics take on Oz is fascinating, but hardly good family entertainment.  I think Disney have done a very credible job of respinning this story to make it interesting for grownups and for kids.  It's not great art, but the plot should make the two hours move right along.<br /><br />Especially given the likes of Mesdames Kunis, Weisz and Williams as our three favorite witches.  Kunis is great, Weisz does just fine with a smaller role that would tempt anyone else over the line into parody. Williams makes the most of what is, inevitably, a bit of a saccharine part. Let's face it, Glinda's not Marilyn.<br /><br />But, to me, James Franco just didn't carry the Oz role.  I truly expect to get beat up by the Francophiles but really, even tho' he used all three of his facial expressions, he didn't sell me.  Okay, they spent their money on SFX, so let's not expect Depp or Damon.  But I kept thinking: what if they got somebody good from TV like Dylan Bruce, or Tony Starr, or (be still my beating heart) Alexander Skarsgard to do this?<br /><br />All in all, I do think the ladies carry the day, and the film, and make it well worth the coin.<br /><br />Now, as to Disney's &#34;failure&#34; to provide a 2D Blu-ray or DVD in the box.... I didn't need it, and if you have a smart tv with Amazon or Hulu plus, or an Apple TV hooked to your TV, you don't either.  Redeeming the download via iTunes yielded not only a really nice 1080p transfer suitable for TV or tablet viewing, but also some bonus materials. When is this a problem?  If you spent the extra $800 to get a disc player in the back of the mini van instead of springing for the iPad or Kindle Fire to entertain the kids.  In which case, yes, you can be upset you did not get your DVD or 2D Blu-ray.  But instead of plunking down $20 for those 2D copies now, do consider saving up for a next gen tablet.  It will be worth it.  And, let's face it, unless there is a special incentive like 3D, the days of inserting a chunk of media in a player are numbered.think the ladies carry the day, and the film, and make it well worth the coin.<br /><br />Now, as to Disney's &#34;failure&#34; to provide a 2D Blu-ray or DVD in the box....

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|One of the best free apps out there and it works works like it should all the time on most phones.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Like this outdoor adventure story, sad what happened to the young man. Left me wanting to know more as to what happened and what led him to be this way.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is an easy read. it is humorous and well written if you want a light read.The old man is truly a &#34;character.&#34;
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This was an average movie that reminded me of the Van Helsing movie based on the weapons used and the overall feel of the movie. I guess it got an R-rating due to gross scenes of violence and a little nudity, which did not add to the movie at all. This should have been made as a PG-13 movie and may have appealed to a wider audience. It was sort of humorous and okay as a rental, but glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater.
B0001907DA|5.0|I love all the Police Academy movies..I was so thrilled to get this box set.I really would love to have it on Blu Ray.This is worth the money!!!! Love it..
B008J05EL8|1.0|Could not get this item to open.  Should have listened to other reviewers. Perhaps this is not for Kindle?  Too, I don't see the necessity for this app.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have read all of Hosseini's books to date and have loved them all. The writing is so beautiful you just can't help but enjoy his choice of words and use of language. This book is also beautiful because it focuses on love,  families, and relationships. I must say however that part of my enjoyment in reading Hosseini's books is the insight into the Afghan culture which was not as prevalent this time.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I was introduced to ZZ Top by Eliminator in the 80s.  As I grew older I kept hearing about the \\"70s\\" ZZ Top and started downloading individual songs as my interest for classic rock grew. Today I have 22 songs from the 70s era and once I saw this Complete Studio Albums I figured it was time to download a few more.  Then I started reading about people's excitement for the original mixes and I went to youtube to do some research.  I couldn't believe the difference between the remixes and the original recordings.  I checked out most of the songs I originally downloaded only to find the most of them are the remix variety.<br /><br />To see for yourself, just go to youtube and search \\"ZZ Top Beer Drinkers\\" and you will find two videos that show the green album cover.  The remix will not be called remix, just ZZ Top - Beer Drinkers & Hell Raisers, and the good version is the one that says \\"Original 1973 Vinyl Mix\\".  Just listen to the first 10 seconds of both and you will hear an incredible difference.<br /><br />Part of me is angry as I feel that I've been listening to the wrong songs all these years.  But now I just ordered this box set on CD which I will be receiving this week and feel like I will be hearing ZZ Top for the first time!!  Love the sound of the preview clips and can't wait to hear what all the original fans already know.<br /><br />Update: I received the box set earlier this week and am so happy that I pulled the trigger on this one!  The songs sound so crisp and clear especially through the Bose speakers in my car. You can actually feel the guitar solos.  I have browsed all the albums and found so many incredible songs that I had never heard before like: Goin' Down to Mexico, Mushmouth Shoutin', Chevrolet, Bar-B-Q, Nasty Dogs And Funky Kings, Avalon Hideaway, and Asleep In The Desert just to name a few.  For $40 this really is a no-brainer.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|i loved it , but then i am a fan of all of jeffrey Archer,s books.HE describe,s all of his character,s so well.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|You always know exactly what you are getting with a collection of greatest hits. If you like Kelly Clarkson's music you'll like this.  If you don't you'll need to see her \\"LIVE\\" to be happy. Just realize a concert ticket costs a lot more and you only get to listen to her once for the price of a ticket. This is a far better value.
0374533555|5.0|I got it long time ago but I have just read the first two chapters. Hope I can keep reading it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun!  Graphics are great, good options, and best of all, it's free!  Would recommend to anyone who likes solitaire.  :-)
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Philip Philips is an amazing talent that hopefully will be around for a very long time. The whole album is great!
B00BWC1UZE|4.0|Well, for Justin Timberlake I would say this CD is probably someone else's music that he is singing.  There are a few songs that make you recognize the sound but the majority of the CD has a &#34;older,&#34; &#34;Jazzy&#34; type quality to the music.  I like the songs but it's seems like the majority of the songs were designed for behind closed doors intimacy between two people, not really dancing.  #10 (Blue ocean floor) is just a &#34;what??&#34; song.  Totally doesn't follow the flow of the CD. I think he could have done better, but I love JT so I can't talk bad.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Be sure and give it a try...but be warned it is very addictive..Hours of fun and very challenging...for all ages.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Great game! Love the lay out  choices. Size of tiles is ideal &amp; easy to see. This will replace a few of my other games.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I read the book. So I was happy to see how closely the movie followed the story line of the book. Great background and acting.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app was super easy to use;  in fact, possibly even better set up than ebay.com itself!  I was easily able to find what I wanted and got it, simple as that!  Would definitely recommend!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|First and foremost I respect the Reeve films and I even respect Singer's \\"Returns\\" nonetheless they were far from perfect. And now that Man Of Steel has been made I can never see myself going back to any other Superman film. Here is why:<br /><br />The Cast:<br /><br />Whether it be Costner or Crowe, Adams or Lane the cast was top notch and treated this Superman with respect. Did I leave out Cavill? Cavill had many doubters asking themselves \\"why\\" when he was cast. Though after this film's release I couldn't imagine anyone doubting him anymore. Cavill was top notch and above and beyond what I expected, he is the Man Of Steel. One could nitpick this film like many others (Star Wars, 2001, etc) but not I and in my eyes Man Of Steel is a perfect Superman film and it deserves a perfect score.<br /><br />The Director:<br /><br />Say what you will about Zack Snyder but he does know action and very much knows how to treat an audience visually. And despite some claiming he cannot develop character well he can. He really had a strong vision as to what David Goyer and Nolan had come up with and despite speculation well this is Snyder's baby and it was as soon as the script was in his hands. If you watched 300 or Watchmen and then Man Of Steel and still feel you must doubt him then that is to bad as he is one of Hollywood's best blockbuster directors.<br /><br />The Writers:<br /><br />While the screenplay was written by David Goyer, Christopher Nolan helped with the story. Both whom worked as writer/director respectively in the 'Dark Knight Trilogy\\" having said that I need not say anything more. They are top notch and have proven it many times.<br /><br />My review was not intended to state the obvious about the plot or give spoilers. Instead I will say that if you think you were a Superman fan before watching this just wait because once Man Of Steel is over you'll feel like a kid again. Everyone from the cast, writers, director all gave it their all and IMO made the best Superman to date.<br /><br />5/5 Stars.
1449437524|5.0|Written by the internet famous The Oatmeal, this short book will have you laughing and tearing up all at the same time!  It has the humor we have come to expect from The Oatmeal, yet a touching and heartwarming side that is often not in many of his comics.  I find the black and white comic of this on his website and just had to buy the book!  It looks like the typical children's story book with a hardcover and only about 20 pages.  After buying this book, I also bought The Oatmeal's other two book releases and loved them!
0307277453|5.0|Neil Shubin takes a very gentle approach to evolution. He is not dogmatic and he uses an informal, conversational tone. Shubin also explains embryology and paleontology and feeds the reader with everything that they need to know. The title is representative of the book in that Shubin mainly discusses the evolution from water-dwelling to land-dwelling life and drawing comparions between humans and aquatic creatures. The subtitle about human evolution is somewhat misleading as this book does not cover the actual evolution of humans e.g., the various iterations of hominids. But this doesn't matter. Shubin writes with self-effacing humor and this book is a lot of fun to read. I recommend it to everyone who wants a general understanding of how evolution is studied or anyone interested in the transition from water- to land-based life. I look forward to reading Shubin's other book, The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People
B009AMANH4|3.0|Couldnt wait for this movie to finish. It was drab and boring  more like a Uni history lecture. Couldnt stand to see it again
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Lots of innovation with each set of levels.  There is a lot of creativity with this developer.  I've played through most of the game and haven't even looked for the in-app purchases. I think it is just for help with levels when you are stuck.  No pressure to buy, yay!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was playing it and my uncle saw me playing it and thought it was cool. The next day my aunt,  cousins and him were all playing it !
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|I just bought the die hard legacy collection and the copy of this isn't the unrated version I wanted to buy this to replace it so I get the better version of the movie so I need to know if this is the unrated version
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. From the first chapter to the last, I was totally engrossed in the plot and characters. Mr. Martin does a great job of character development and story telling that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's definitely a happy fathers day. My kids are so preoccupied now it's awesome. Game on baby yeah. Baby yeah. Lol
B002WSASIC|5.0|Absolutely not what you expect, and the themes explored, and the revelations of some of the plot twists, make this a must see!
B004XUMMFE|3.0|Okay plot, although seems rather masoganistic. 1st season so lots of character development that didn't get to go anywhere. Bummer that under Amazon prime search it shows Season 2 & 3. When I went to watch season 2 I found out there was none.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|Realistically,  if you are easily offended by racial comments, gender comments, regional comments, and crude language - then pass on this. It is not picking fun at any particular groups of people, this is a dictator, he hits them all. So if you are okay with some crude humor its not a terrible movie. I think low reviews are mostly from people who were upset by comments made. Its not the whole movie though, its woven into it here and there. There is a lot of other things happening and some very funny moments.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This is one of the Bond movies that doesn't concentrate as much on cool gadgets and clever doohickeys. It is more raw and intense action. Craig is not so much a technical engineer in this one as he is a pure badass.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was such a visually and emotionally powerful movie.  I loved walking with Pi on his incredible journey.  This movie kept me interested from the beginning, and on the edge of my seat!  Loved it!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|The movie felt like a typical action sequel that provides a little extra revenue for the production company. It was a &#34;1-time watch&#34; move, as I like to call it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We are quite taken with the new directions that the 2nd season introduced. The acting remains as good as we have ever seen on the small or big screen. But the story with it twists and surprises has been wonderful. It is as well written as the very different show, The Sopranos and my personal favorite Mad Men.<br />Respectfully,<br />The Ganleys in Buffalo, NY
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a challenging game. I enjoyed playing it and would recommend it to everyone to give it a try.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to use.  No problems with the download or the app.  Opens easily and updates as needed.  A little different than on the computer but very user friendly
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Just started to listen to clutch, octane been playing them a lot . Seems like this band is getting better with each album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was great for getting a little mind exercise! Would definitely recommend it to friends. Make more rounds please!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Fun game. Keeps me entertained. It is challenging but so much that it is frustrating to move up to the next level
1401324649|5.0|It was wonderful reading ,captivating and I lived every moment of it. I found it hard to put the book down each time that I started reading it. Sileo.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The stars mini-game when you finish the mini-game the thing in the middle keeps spinning and spinning around and won't stop so you don't know if your pony get to level up or not
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I love this album it took a lil bit to get usto some songs but its a great album and we all know Wayne works hard
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is on of the best animal games I've played. This is good for all ages. Good understandable directions and very life like animation. This game could help teach a child what owning an animal is all about.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Was on a trip for the weekend with some friends and it really helped me when dealing with a particular person who can be extremely annoying at times.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Remember the jams everybody danced and relaxed in the 70's those were the times and can still remember to the good times.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Passion of the Christ is Mel Gibson's crowning achievement. It is strictly from the biblical account but where the scriptures are silent, Gibson's imagination adds to the experience as it literally brings the viewer to the Garden of Gethsemane and walks us through passion of Jesus Christ. Using biblical languages adds to that experience all the more that even if we dont understand the language, we can still follow the story. We can see the close bond between Jesus and his mother, the struggle of faith of his apostles and we can even sense why it is many were opposed to the Christ. There is love and hatred, fear and faith and we are left an emotional wreck trying to contemplate this great mystery of faith.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|They certainly keep you guessing as to what will happen next with the family & staff of Downton Abbey.  There are the characters that you love, and those that you love to hate!  I would definitely watch season 1 first, and be sure to keep track of the movement of time.  Some episodes happen over months, and some take only a few days.  Looking forward to watching season 3 soon!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and entertaining for all  ages.  It really challenges your brain.  It is addictive. Great challenging levels.<br />I highly recommend Flow Free.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I didn't even want to rate it because it took me a hour to find the word I needed...when I can get a app and and just type the word in...it could some improvements like a place to type in the word you want to look up...that would be nice
B000I9W08I|5.0|This is an absolute classic! The entire cast, the costumes, as well as the choreography, are all amazing! If you don't like musicals, this is not for you. However, if you want a fun and catchy romp in turn-of-the-century New York, you are sure to enjoy. Also, if you have seen Wall-E and wondered what he was watching, it was a different version of Hello, Dolly!
B009AMANH4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and find it valuable for my young grandchildren to watch when they come to visit. I recommend it.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This cd is great!!!! Worth the money to get the Best Buy edition with the 4 bonus songs. The bonus song Methademic is incredible!!!! Ozzy sounds great on this cd, the best he has sounded since the No Rest For the Wicked/No More Tears era. Tony and Geezer incredible as always and Brad Wilk does a great job on drums. If your a true fan of Sabbath and hard rock music you need to buy this, it will not disappoint!!!! The extra track on the best buy edition is called Naivete In Black and it rocks!!! Killer riffs from Mr. Iommi as always. If this is the last cd they make together at least they went out with a bang!!!! Long Live Sabbath!!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This was a very suspenseful read, very hard to put down. I finished quicker than any book I have read so far. I was in the dark right up until the last few pages then it started becoming clear. Very good.
B0033TJATW|5.0|It is Michael Jackson and mostly everyone love the KING!  This was awesome!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It works very well with my Kindle Fire and is longer than the cord that come with it. I am glad that I ordered it.
B0001I55OC|3.0|If you can just put the novel out of your mind when watching this film, it's actually pretty enjoyable once the characters are transported back to medieval France.  But the problem is that all of Crichton's wonderful lead-up to that point in the book is just rushed and way too truncated in the film, and utterly squanders the value of what Crichton presented in his book as a teachable and debatable lesson in quantum mechanics and alternate timelines.  None of the technological or character set-up was apparently scripted (or filmed) for this movie.<br /><br />As a result, what we're left with is a slightly more intellectual than usual time-travel movie that is done very well once the characters are actually transported to the past.  But that's not the unique value of a Michael Crichton story.  The unique value of a Michael Crichton story lies in all the moments of didactic teaching exchange between characters who have a unique knowledge of something, and the characters they engage in explaining and clarifying it to.  Yet, over and over again, so many of the Hollywood shallowists who take up the task of making Crichton's stories into films, are either completely oblivious of this fact, or are too smugly dismissive of its value.  As a result, you end up with just more cookie-cutter action films, but with the name \\"Michael Crichton\\" tacked onto them.<br /><br />The casting is actually very good for this film, but I think the fault lies with the director, or with whoever compelled him to make something significantly less than a Michael Crichton story, or with whichever pivotal person who presumed they knew what a Michael Crichton story is, but really didn't.  For example, Gerard Butler is great in this film for what he was directed to be, but the problem is that he wasn't stretched, by the director, into the typical central Michael Crichton character, who is a bit more of an academic-minded \\"Aspie\\" (look it up) with an overtendency to deliver didactic monologues.  I too often miss that in adaptations of Crichton films.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- Timeline is done very well, for what it is.  But the problem is that what it should have been, is a Michael Crichton story, with a good deal more cerebralized preaching and topical lecturing as integral parts of the storyline.ften miss that in adaptations of Crichton films.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- Timeline is done very well, for what it is.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I must admit, I was a bit disappointed to discover that I would have to wait for yet another book to get my HEA, a finale of some kind. However, I could never get enough of Gideon and Eva. Much more romance and steamy moments in this book. Loved it. Although there was no big climatic moment in this book, there were several smaller ones that kept me guessing and questioning. Can't wait to see what the next book uncovers. Not sure how much further the story can be stretched but look forward to reading.
B0014QABX0|4.0|Although the sound is unique to the earlier days of The Black Keys it still has a great blues/rock sound. If you just now found The Black Keys then purchase this album to add to your collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a fantastic book! I read it on my Kindle and found myself reading it very fast because I felt so emotionally invested in the characters.

B002PMPTIO|5.0|JJ Adams has brought back to life the Star Trek franchise. This picture had action, humor, and great tender moments. Bring Leonard<br />Nimoy to bridge the gap from the old to the new was a great Idea. All the characters we have loved to know are back in this movie<br />Bones MCcoy , Montgomery Scott, Mr Sulu, Mr Chekov, Lt Uhura, Spock and Captain Kirk what a feel I was so impressed with every aspect of the film. I know JJ will do really well in the next film. Awesome Movie i have to see it many times over and over.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Not all that scary.  It was mostly just creepy.  I guess it was ok if you like that sort of movie.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|While the story line was interesting as well as educational and shocking (if there is any truth to the way orphans were treated in Ireland by the Catholic church, which there appears to be true), the novel moved somewhat slowly.  It wasn't one of those books that I couldn't put down.  The author does a good job, however, of evoking the pastoral feeling of rural northern Ireland and a decent job of developing the main characters.  The reader can understand how the &#34;Misremembered&#34; Man turned out as he did.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|This 2nd season was all over the place.  It was too weird.  I stopped watching it half way through the season because I didn't want to waist my time.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|After all these years since the wizard of oz, this is the best possible script they could have come<br />up with? The cartoony cgi didn't quite work either.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This film was entertaining and interesting.  The over the top bloodiness was typical Tarrantino.  I would recommend this movie to his fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it was fun I liked it<br />it has a lot of fun features I just wish I didn't have to wait that long for stuff to get done
B000I3SYEI|5.0|The Best Star Trek movie of any type, Original Series, Next Gen, or Reboot.  Strong story line, good direction, great villain.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of my favorite books! I can't stop reading. You can't just read one but you hunger to read every single word waiting for more. You can't just stop at the first. And you keep turning pages even as the words are over.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Jeez...this HAS to be the BEST game I have ever played. Almost better than the REAL minecraft. I think they need to wolve, slimes and caves though.
0670026603|5.0|Thanks, quick delivery. I'm sure I will enjoy reading this book. Based upon the reviews alone I'm sure it will be a great read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game many levels, easy to maneuver through the levels. Short or long term this game will keep you occupied
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|This SciFi Channel series is ending after 5 seasons, and it's too bad because it is EXCELLENT! I LOVE Merlin and the entire cast really made the series work. This final season really shows Merlin maturing and becoming more confident in his abilities and his destiny. I would be a fan for another 5 seasons if it were to remain on the air.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book until I finished it! A masterpiece! And I recommend this book to all fantasy lovers!<br />I love this book!
B001HBYH9Q|4.0|In spite of the preposterous plot this romantic comedy is great fun and very skillfully acted and directed. Julia Roberts is amazing, so vulnerable and yet so sexually potent that she lights up the film. She is a true star here. Hugh Grant as always is superb. His timing and his humor are impeccable. I would watch anything he is in. The supporting cast is terrific.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Dark film about a crazy lady - who needs some real help, but all the evil doctors and evil drug companies just keep druggin her up.  Shucks~ can't any get through the day in this film without \\"mother's little helper.\\"  I guess not.  Love the scene with a crying lady wailing, \\"but the drug companie's commercials say the drugs will make you better...\\" Really?  How about someone for once (oops I KNOW this is America and we aren't capable of this) helping themselves.  Nah...just give me a drug.<br /><br />Film is pure Hollywood claptrap for the clueless, the dumb, the blamers, and the intellectually lazy. It just talks on and on while this totally crazy woman just wanders around in a fog- thinking about throwing herself in front of a train.  Stinks.<br /><br />Now all the nuts out there-taking a ton of drugs- hit this review with the comments of \\"you're so mean..--ect....\\" blah blah blah...whatever.  This movie stinks.
B0007OCG56|5.0|I'm late to the party with this movie but I feel \\"SPANGLISH\\" has become one of my favorites of all time.  It isn't the greatest movie but I found it to be warmhearted, funny and well acted by a fine cast.  It was a good story to introduce one of Spain's national treasures, Paz Vega, to the general public.  Oh yes, very beautiful and quite talented is Paz Vega!<br /><br />I thought the daughters were well chosen and their characters played an integral part in the plot and tenor of the movie. They filled out this large family including \\"chump\\" the dog.  Adam Sandler's  right brain/left brain cross talking husband made sense within the nucleus of the story.  The contrasting personalities of the mothers didn't negate the warmth within this \\"collective\\" family.  It only added to the overall emotional mayhem in the movie.  If you think this is dismissive of a Latin woman trying to learn English, how's your Spanish coming?<br /><br />A movie that I've enjoyed with multiple viewings.  A keeper that's in my collection for sure.  And WOW, he made a great looking sandwich! :)
B0036SSZIC|4.0|This is vintage Michael Moore. Perhaps less focused than \\"Roger & Me\\", \\"Farenheit 9/11\\", or \\"Sicko\\", Moore, nonetheless, makes his point in this semi-documentary, a genre of which he is a master. Released in 2009, it opens with a disclaimer from an unsmiling narrator warning anyone with a heart condition or is easily upset, or is in the company of impressionable young children, to leave the theater immediately for one's own health and safety. It next cuts to a clip from an Encyclopaedia Britannica Films documentary entitled \\"Life in Ancient Rome\\", most likely produced in the mid to late 1940's, and intended as an audio-visual supplement in high schools of that period as a part of the then traditional instructional pedagogy. Anyone familiar with Edward Gibbon's six volume classic of the late eighteenth century entitled \\"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" with all of its attendant irony will enjoy the next several minutes of film as its intercuts between the rise and fall of Rome, and clips of the principals of the George W. Bush administration as they preside over the end of \\"American Exceptionalism\\". GM and G.W. have been previous targets of Mr. Moore, so he is on familiar ground when he returns to his native Flint, Michigan to show b&w film clips of the GM plant there in its glory days during the 1930's and '40's, and scenes of a crumbling community today after the departure of GM. During the opening titles of the film we see actural footage of a security camera in a bank as it records an armed robbery in progress while \\"Louie, Louie\\" plays in the background. Much of the remaining footage deals with the big banks, Wall Street and capitalism in general and what has resulted in recent years in, or to this country from an unbridled laissez faire (literally: \\"let people do as they choose\\") form of capitalism. Moore has used his form of story telling to make the same point as writers like Andrew J. Bacevich made in his book of 2008 entitled \\"The Limits of Power\\". The message: \\"Beware of what you ask for!\\" What you get is likely not going to be what you asked for. He reminds us, through interviews with three Catholic clerics, that Jesus did not advocate capitalism, though he clererly overdubs an old movie about Jesus where the latter appears, or sounds, like he is ardently advocating this economic nodel. There is the implied suggestion that the gospel message of the New Testament and the \\"Gospel of Success\\" that is preached in many venues today are neither synonymous nor compatible. Moore, it should be noted, is a practicing Catholic. He also makes a trip to the National Archives in a vain search for mention of the word \\"capitalism\\" in the U.S. Constitution. The film ends with with quotations from some of our founding fathers, e.g. \\"I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies\\" ... Thomas Jefferson, 1816; or \\"Property monopolized or in the possession of a few is a curse to mankind\\" ... John Adams, 1765. As the quotes scroll by one hears the voice of Merle Haggard singing an old Woody Guthrie classic \\"Jesus Christ.\\"  If you are one who can be provoked into an excerise of the brain called \\"independenty thought\\", then this is a movie for you, but for the easily excitable, be sure and take your blood pressure medication before inserting the disk into your DVD player.mits of Power\\".

B00B1L6B4G|4.0|This book entertain on several levels:  a fun \\"who-dun-it\\" in the Agatha Christie mold, where  all of the suspects are in the \\"same room\\";  a satisfying, somewhat unexpected resolution.  It was good.<br />The more rewarding level, was the historical, fiction approach to a fascinating, horrific and mind-numbing period of history.  I have recently read \\"hhhh\\" by Laurent Binet - also an extraordinary book dealing with the assassination of Heydrich from a different literary perspective.  I would strongly encourage reading the two books in tandem - it would make for a remarkable experience.<br />The moral ambiguities haunting Bernie Gunther are likewise an issue unto itself - points out again the horrible dilemmas of war where there is simply no correct answer to a morally wrong question....
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|...which is why I'm glad I waited to see this at home and didn't pay to see this at the movie theater. Hollywood should know by now to just leave Frank L. Baum's other work alone. Nothing will ever touch the classic that Wizard of Oz is or partner up to it, so just stop trying. If anything, someone should make Gregory Maguire's Wicked into a movie already.<br /><br />They should have also known better because of Warner Bros. tight hold on the 1939 classic which prevented this movie from using certain elements and characters. They had to make the wicked witch's green skin a different shade and could not give her the trademark wart on the chin. That's too bad because a certain house falling from the sky into munchkin land would have made a nice ending and lead into the \\"sequel.\\"<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie. I really did. After all, it is Disney. And like everyone else who flocked to see it, I've been a lifelong fan of the Judy Garland classic. I just could not admire James Franco as the wizard no matter how much I tried, but I haven't really enjoyed him in anything since Spiderman. The box office would have loved Johnny Depp in the roll, but I would have preferred someone like Lee Pace.<br /><br />Another problem is identity. The younger generation probably won't know right away who the wicked witches are, not until Theodora turns green anyway. It would have also been nice to see who China Girl and Finley were from the wizard's previous life. Other than their voices, there is no obvious clue.<br /><br />There's also too much time spent building up to the climax where's there just isn't much going on.  The climax of the movie is well worth it, but I think part of that was because I knew it was almost over. If anything, the movie made me want to go back and read the classics of Baum. I haven't read them all, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who had this feeling. So any movie who can spark reading in us has some worth.<br /><br />I'm an adult though, so who cares what I think?! Kids will love this movie. But the original classic will always win over the kids and the kids at heart!ares what I think?! Kids will love this movie. But the original classic will always win over the kids and the kids at heart!
0670014893|5.0|There is little that I can add to all of the reviews, other than to echo the incredible writing, the depth of characters, the presentation of massive moral dilemmas.  Le Carre's ability to write about topics that are in our headlines on a daily basis in such an engaging literary style, is a continued gift to the reader.  I am likewise, always enthralled by his endings - you take nothing for granted;  this book being no exception - I still am somewhat confused by the details of the ending, but the finality of the event is indisputable!  Great read!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|\\"It's dangerous to need someone that much. You're trying to save him, and he's hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\\"<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire was an emotional, gut-wrenching, sexy train wreck. I could not put this book down. It has been a while since I stayed up until 3AM to finish a 400 page book, but I loved every second of it. Even though this was published back in 2012, I kept seeing and reading about this author and this book and the famous Travis Maddox, everybody and their mother's book boyfriend. I finally got the chance to see what the fuss was about, and all I could say at the end of it was HOLY CRAP this was freaking fabulous!<br /><br />Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox have easily become one of my favorite couples in the fiction world. Yes, they are a mess and a half, and yes, some people might think that their relationship is doomed to fail, but once you read what these two incredibly complex characters go through in Beautiful Disaster you will discover that these two people, their love for each other is so unconditional, so intense and vulnerable that you can't help but root for them. Even after some of the ridiculously stupid crap that Travis does, you will still fall in love with this messed up, tattooed bad boy. I know I did for sure!<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews for this book, I know some of you out there will disagree with perception of Travis and his relationship with Abby. I know Travis is violent and sometimes can be a major bad guy when he wants to be. I know he is a womanizer and never sleeps with the same girl twice. You just have to understand that this kid grew up with a father and a bunch of brothers that beat on him when they could. His mother died when he was young, so he had no woman figure to help calm him. I'm surprised he is still alive with all the shit he had to put up with growing up. It's no wonder he makes money beating the living crap out of other people, it's all he has ever known. As far as the womanizer thing goes, at least he is upfront with the women he sleeps with. They know they are only another notch in his belt. When Abby comes in to his life, she becomes that woman figure that he has needed all his life. She calms him and gives him some sense of peace in his life. Even though their relationship might be a time bomb waiting to explode, I will always believe that they will find their way back to each other.<br /><br />\\"I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it wasn't something about you at all. it was just you.\\"<br /><br />If you like suspenseful, incredibly emotional reads that will have your head spinning and your stomach turning, then Beautiful Disaster is for you. If you don't mind getting in to these messed up characters heads and taking what they dish out no matter what, then this book is for you. But be forewarned, you will laugh, you will scream and curse, you will ball your eyes out! You might even re think what you know about true love. One thing for sure, you will be touched by this incredibly, fixating, intense story of a couple who will do anything to find their way back to each other.far as the womanizer thing goes, at least he is upfront with the women he sleeps with.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|We waited awhile until after all the initial \\"hype\\" to watch this....plus it is a long movie....but it lived up to all the accolades and gives great insight to the man, his Presidency, politics, and the tragedy of those times.<br /><br />This is a \\"must see\\" for every American!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I can see why everyone is talking about this book.  Every woman who ventures into the business world needs to read it.  I saw so many mistakes I make in body language, mind-set, goal-setting and more.  Thank you so much for baring your soul and letting all of us into your personal boardroom.  Buy this book.  Read this book.  Then read this book again, and follow her advice.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Great book, loved every page, just enough background, just enough gossip, just enough of a peak behind the scenes to keep every page interesting. Tina Fey is an unassuming mega-star, she actually seems more surprised by her fame than anything else.  Certainly doesn't take herself too seriously.  Great light read.
B007A4Y1Q8|2.0|very creative? yes.  Compassionate for the human soul? no.<br /><br />Hard to find a film so full of itself in its supposed humor laughing at what is really a horror story.  In fact the end shots in the swimming pool are very creepy.<br /><br />Ironically as we enter a period where the term \\"avatar\\" is commonplace, the film is a bit of a warning about what it may be to live in a simulated world.  Nice for those who can leave but not those who can't.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Best free collection so far. Only free collection I have. But by far my favorite. Go ahead and give it a go it's worth every penny.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Its a fun game!  And it is not so consuming that you can't put it down.  GREAT FOR WHEN YOU HAVE A FEW MINUTES TO WAIT.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This game is the sekend best game I have played in my life. Minecraft is my favorit game. But, this game you are running away from a guy.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|This is a &#34;must read&#34; for every woman and all the men in her life . Be they brothers, husbands, bosses or simply friends, it is so logical and sensible. I was afraid that it was going to be an anti-man rant but it is anything but.  I found it inspirational and I am recommending it to all my friends and family and anyone who will listen. Well done Sheryl.
B008XG1X18|5.0|tons of fun and an all around great app. *no problems*<br />I also love the catogiries.easy setup to figure out.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We watched this movie with our 3 & 4 year olds. It was a great choice for our movie night. My kids do better with G rated movies and really good ones are difficult to find. It was even entertaining for the adults. Highly recommend.
B00821OX98|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS SHOW IS -- STEPHEN SPIELBERG HAS DONE IT AGAIN.  THE 2ND SEASON WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE 1ST!!!!!
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|1) two stars because Black Sabbath is back together, and I get to see them in August, awesome.<br />2) this album sucks, sorry. sounds like they were trying to write nice pop metal. ozzy's voice is so processed it drives me crazy. there's no 'heavy' riffs, it's really girly 'metal' if that's what you wanna call it. not a fan of this whatsoever, and it feels completely forced.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man Of Steel is receiving mixed reviews from critics, and I always say you cant really listen to a critic. I usually listen to what actual people have to say. I went and saw Man of Steel for myself and let me tell you just wow! It was a great film. Henry Cavill is the best Superman since Christopher Reeve, Tim Daly, George Newbern. Michael Shannon although not as good as Terrence Stamp still did a great job playing General Zod. Russell Crowe is a badass Jor-EL he kicked alot of butt in this film even as a hologram! Amy Adams is gorgeous and great as usual although she didn't have much screen time she still had pretty awesome chemistry with all the actors. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner were amazing playing their two characters. Kevin Costner had a great performance when he is about to die, you will see. Laurence Fishburne I felt was underused severly but he was still awesome when he was on the screen. I think that like it did for Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. this will show the world what Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon can do and it will make them huge stars.<br /><br />The Script-I felt the script was great and the changes the made were pretty badass and very interesting. Now some of the things I disliked about the film as Perry White was black and he refused to run something about aliens because it would cause mass panic. Perry White would never not run that story. Another thing I disliked is a tad bit of plot induced stupidity and that is Superman not knowing or having developed his freeze breath yet. He would of easily have won the fight against the machines and his fellow Kryptonians. Another thing I disliked is Jenny Olsen not being Jimmy Olsen. That is just plain freaking stupid and the actress who played Jenny Olsen was just awful and hurt the film when she was on screen. I hope they bring Jenny Olsens brother Jimmy Olsen into Man of Steel 2, etc.<br /><br />Special Effects- This film had the greatest special effects I have ever seen since Terminator2 and Avatar.<br /><br />Visual Effects- I felt were very rarely done and it was nice.<br /><br />Locations-I like the locations they used in this film I felt it fit the mood and tone of the film very nicely.<br /><br />Direction-I have never liked a single one of Zack Snyder's films they have always been awful and same with Christopher Nolan except for Prestige, Batman Begins, Dark Knight, David Goyer, Jonathan Nolan. They all wrote a great script being honest to the source material for once and delivered the best film so far this year.<br /><br />Choreography- The battles and the fight scenes in this movie are going to be hard pressed to surpass they were simply unbelievable and crazy as hell wait til you see it.<br /><br />Musical Score- I felt the musical score was god awful except for some parts. They need to bring in another composer like patrick Doyle for future films.<br /><br />The Future for Superman-I feel this film is going to make about 1 billion and 100 million dollars and will be used as a template to how all superhero films should be made in the future. Justice League is going to be amazing as long as Zack Snyder and company continue to stay on board for at least 6 Man of Steel films and a Justice League film.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Even though Lincoln is the main character, it is hardly biographical as the title would seem to suggest. It should be titled \\"The 13th Amendment\\" or maybe \\"Lincoln takes a deep and labored breath before saying something folksy while pushing for the 13th amendment\\".<br /><br />I am a history buff and typically eat these kinds of movies up, but this just fell horribly flat for me. I thought Daniel Day Lewis was awfully mediocre as Lincoln and was even downright annoying at times. The people who say they were \\"riveted\\" or \\"glued to their seat\\" must not have been aware of what the outcome would be. Otherwise I just don't see being drawn in by the manner in which this movie tells the story.<br /><br />The only reason I could see buying this is to show a class of students who are not aware of the historical events and would actually get the educational benefit from it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  It had some good puzzles lots of hidden object games.  The mini clips were quite good.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Just not my kind of book.  The plot was too slow.  I didn't see the movie so I don't know if was a better story.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|After taking 2 years off because David Tennant left, I came back with an objective mind & ended up really like Matt Smith. Not better, just different.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good free game which makes you think out of the box and remember what you have seen and what you need to put where
0425264386|5.0|After seeing the movie, The Reacher character interested me so I bought the first book the! Killing Floor, very good read..........<br />so now I'm hooked on Lee's series. Reacher is hobo/badass!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game. It is great to play when you have nothing to do. All you need to do is first make a small (or big) house out of dirt (survival). Then cut wood and make a crafting table and a bed and a mine. And do whatever you do like: build a larger wooden house or tnt your mine.
B00008RWAX|5.0|I really loved this book. His life is so amazing that I enjoyed every bit of it. A person to admire , an example to follow , a hero.
B0045INOCO|4.0|I watched in interest as I hadn't seen this movie since it was first released.  I noticed many things now that I couldn't have been aware of at the time. I could see how it had influenced many film makers to come. In particular I saw many scenes that Ridley Scott's Blade Runner kind of grabbed from this movie. Atmosphere and an epic quality. I'm not a real fan of war movies, with this being an exception. Good Job Mr. Coppola...
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I've watched this movie in Blu-ray and DVD and think it is great either way. I can't wait for the other two movies.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Broad ranging story with lots of detail.  Intrigue inside of intrigue.  A surprise at every turn!  I have not seen the HBO Series;  but the book is captivating.  A bit of a slow read at times;  but worth every minute to red carefully in order to absorb all the nuances.
1885167776|5.0|This book is by far Gary's best work.  He has a natural ability to break things down to easy steps and this book does exactly that.  If you need to learn or re-learn to focus on getting the major things in your life completed this book is for you.  This is one of those books that you buy 10 or more copies and give to all of your friends.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Ended up picking the Goonies for a B-movie lover friend at a great price!  The quality was fantastic, and the audio was superb!  If you're a movie lover, and a B-movie lover, you shouldn't less this deal pass you by!  GOOD BUY!
B008EKOIN8|4.0|A book to really open your eyes to the terrible state  our food industry has brought to the average American diet.  How much better we could eat by preparing our own food instead of rely in the highly processed food promoted and sold by the food industry.  Most food is prepared for the industries ease and profit, not our health.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I have seen the movie too and they are very much alike. I enjoyed this book very much. Read this book!!!!
B008K9UZY4|2.0|Would love to play then game but 2 hours into downloading I'm at 25 percent. Ridiculous. If I have the opportunity to play I may update stars. Talk to u in a couple months at this point.
B00000JSJC|1.0|Totally boring!Save your money.I wish someone could of advised me about the ridiculousness of this movie.So surprised by the reviews which makes me suspicious.I have heard about complaints of fixed reviews and deleting of low ratings for the purpose of sale.Anyway, back to my analysis,it is so messed up that at one point these two great actors had to settle for these kind of roles.This movie sucked!Let's just say, it is not a movie i would ever want to see twice.I would of rather rented than bought this stupid movie, which was a complete insult to my intelligence.Plus, all the sexually abusive bondage and violent behavior toward women in this film.I have never been this harsh,but i am disgusted!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|And frankly I thrilled there is more to come.  I'll take all the Gideon I can get!  Should Ms. Day and her publishers have been upfront about it - absolutely and honestly given the fallout it was a very stupid decision (or mistake) on their part.  But this book was still a great read and deserves more than two or three stars.
B0060D0XE4|5.0|I love all the hero and the stars in the movie. Linda carter is great.  My kids really like the movie.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I loved this episode. I kinda see why they didn't air it on TV, since there are guns and children involved in the episode, but you really do miss a lot of information on the main plot (the relationships and interactions of Hannibal and the other main characters).  Plus Molly Shannon did an excellent job in this episode.  Definitely watch this if you possibly can.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Okay. This is like the BEST game EVER!!! Personally....I think its Better than temple run. I like that game to~ but this is better! :)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great characters with human flaws and facinating strengths.  I really love this series.  Oh yes, great actors and actresses too.<br />And, something that seems impossible with today's series.  You almost never get a poor episode.  There is always variety and<br />a story line that grabs your interest and holds it from beginning to end.<br />GJC
0545128285|5.0|She's already a big fan, and this apparently added more breath and depth to her fanaticism. If you're already a fan, or thinking about becoming a fan, then this is for you - per my daughter.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game I loads of fun for all ages. I have four grandchildren living with me from 5 to 13 and they all enjoy this game
B00632HWOG|4.0|Great.  I like being able to check my email on my tablet as well as on my computer.  It's convenient.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was a great read, full of twists and turns. Kept me hooked till the last page. Looking forward to the next one.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is a fun little game that I found to be unique enough to keep me interested until the end. The only reason for not giving five stars is the fact that there weren't more levels (I ran through the game,which is rare for me), also having to pay for hints was upsetting.<br />  This is a game both my nine year old daughter and myself had a blast with.<br />  All in all, I really had fun with this game and recommend it if you are looking for a game with a different style.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|For a free game. It has a pretty nice range of things to offer. As far as skills, weapons, armour, and trinkets. Let's not forget the multiplayer.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Wow! Really? Trilogy means three! Disappointed and done with this series, publisher and Sylvia Day for sure! Wish I had known as bout the 7 day return policy two days late,  what a pure rip off you should be ashamed of your business practices.
B0087WRGVY|5.0|This is the first I have heard of Eclipse...and it's AWESOME! Power chords, great guitar riffs and power drumming all mixed into great melody and progressions. Rarely to I like every song on CD but these guys nailed it. Every cut is great...hard to chose a favorite. It's like the best of 80's power metal but with a new bite and edge! Looking forward to more from these guys and would love to see them tour in America!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Summer beach reading - but Reacher is too much like other army men heroes in recent books. I did like the story line
1935597760|5.0|This writer has the gift of bringing you into the moment.  There are parts about the abuse of children that are so disturbing but necessary to tell .  I wish Ms.McKenna would write a sequel about Jaime's experience as a young boy on the farm and his acclimation from Orphan to adult.<br /><br />  This book is a keeper and should be read as Summer readings.  All races and nationalities have suffered throughout time. The orphans even as of today are really &#34;misforgotten&#34; and left to fend for themselves early in life.  There will be some interesting discussions in book clubs.  A good lesson from this book is that we should reflect that we don't really know what lives some people have led and we must be kind..don't take anyone for granted. Don't judge.<br />This is really a great book.
B00AG297GK|5.0|It's nice to see a really good (and funny) MOVIE from Sacha Baron Cohen, not just a faux documentary but something with a good story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My kids and I really enjoyed this. Puzzles were challenging. Game got more exciting as we went along. Waiting for  the next  Room.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Action packed, impossible situations, smart alack comments at inappropriate moments and of course John McClane comes out on top.  Die Hard fans will love this movie.  If you didn't like the previous editions of Die Hard, you ain't gonna like this one either.  It was clearly made for the fans.  I give 5 stars to movies I would watch again - once is enough for this one.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Excellent following season in keeping with the standard of humor thoughout the series. If you've not seen the show thus far, watch from the beginning and experience a suprising amount of character development. For current fans, let's hope for four more years and Sheldon's marriage in the series finale.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|According to my little girl, this is the greatest game she has ever played on her Kindle! Why? I think it's because of the graphics and the monsters and the speed and the excitement the game produces. Those are her words - not mine! She also thinks it's much more difficult than all the other Temple Run games, bar the Brave version, so that might be one of the reason, too. You should try it! Based on my little girl's reaction, I think you'll enjoy it!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who does not like Facebook! Keeps you in touch with all of your friends in one place and helps a busy mom with birthdays.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I am about two thirds through the jack reacher series and I haven't found a Jack Reacher book that I didn't enjoy.  Reacher is hard to fathom at times, he takes the hard road everytime, but the journey is enjoyable.
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|I previously had a 5800K in my HTCP and I was more than satisfied with its performance but now I have the 6800K in my HTPC that I use to watch movies and do some light gaming and it works like charm. It handles everything I throw at it without a hassle. Since the 6800K supports memory speeds of 2133Mhz, system memory speeds are important because both the CPU and GPU share the same memory interface and this is very improvement if you are a gamer because it can boost your FPS quiet a lot. I noticed a smoothness when playing games coming from the 5800K that ran at 1600Mhz.<br /><br />The stock frequency of the CPU is 4.1Ghz (1.4 volts) but it has a nice turbo of 4.4Ghz which is great. And the stock frequency of the GPU is 844Mhz (1.25 volts). The stock settings are more than enough to handle anything but I have mine overclocked to 4.8Ghz and it flies. It runs relatively cool with the stock cooler without needing to upgrade to an aftermarket cooler. I even tried overclocking it to 5Ghz using my CM212+ using 1.51volts but it generated a lot of heat so I went down to 4.8Ghz. I also overclocked the GPU to 1020Mhz from stock 844Mhz using around 1.34 volts and games are much more smoother now.<br /><br />The motherboard that I am using to overclock my 6800K to 4.8Ghz is the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO which is the best motherboard you can get for FM2 socket. The Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO has 8 phase VRMs which makes it awesome to overclock and it can handle a ton of volts without a problem. I have seen some people push the 6800K up to 5.3Ghz using this board with around 1.58 volts which is incredible if you ask me. I highly recommend getting the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO if you want the best FM2 socket motherboard. The motherboard will also support Kaveri (28nm) when it's released which will bring a ton of improvements and lower power consumption.<br /><br />Let's talk a bit about the power consumption at 4.8Ghz because it really is amazing how little power this thing consumes. In idle, it consumes roughly 8-9 watts and under full load it consumes around 108-110watts. Even though Core i3 Ivy Bridge is at 22nm and has better power consumption than Richland which is at 32nm, I still think the power consumption is more than acceptable.<br /><br />I am able to play games like Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2 and Counter Strike GO without a problem at 1920x1080. It can even handle some modern games at medium settings which I think is amazing. I'm really impressed with the APUs that AMD has been making.<br /><br />Here are some benchmarks that I did against the 5800K both overclocked to 4.5Ghz. I wanted to test both of them at 4.8Ghz but I couldn't get the 5800K anywhere near 4.6Ghz without crashing and the temps going through the roof so instead I dialed it back at 4.5Ghz.<br /><br />SuperPi<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 1394.66 Seconds<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 1244.22 Seconds<br /><br />Cinebench 11.5 (Multi-Threaded-GPU)<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 37.54 FPS<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 45.38 FPS<br /><br />Cinebench 11.5 (Multi-Threaded-CPU)<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 3.26<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 3.87<br /><br />All the games that I have tested so far have been at max settings except for Metro LL and BF3 which were unplayable. The resolution is 1920x1080 using the iGPU.<br /><br />Metro Last Light - Medium Settings<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 17FPS avg<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 19FPS avg<br /><br />Battlefield 3 - Medium Settings<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 21FPS avg<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 24FPS avg<br /><br />Team Fortress 2 - Max Settings<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 59FPS avg<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 64FPS avg<br /><br />Counter Strike GO - Max Settings<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 61FPS avg<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 68FPS avg<br /><br />Left 4 Dead 2 - Max Settings<br /><br />5800K @ 4.5Ghz = 55FPS avg<br />6800K @ 4.5Ghz = 57FPS avg<br /><br />Overall, the improvements over the 5800K makes this worthless to upgrade so I wouldn't upgrade if I was stuck on a 5800K but if you are thinking about building an HTPC then Richland is the way to go. As you can see from the results above, the improvements in games and applications is less than impressive. What I like about AMD and their APUs is the fact they still use the same socket (FM2) which means you will be able to upgrade your APU in the future to the one that will use the steamroller cores which will be bring a ton of improvements and lower the power consumption drastically. The iGPU in the 6800K is also much faster than Haswell's iGPU and will play games a lot smoother. The driver support will also be better than Intel because it will be directly from AMD. I give this APU a 4/5 just because of the tiny improvements over Trinity. I don't have a lot of time now but I will update my review once I do more tests.<br /><br />If you guys want to read my review of the Asus A85X F2A85-V PRO then go to this link and it should be the first one listed there.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/ASUS-240-Pin-Motherboards-F2A85-V-PRO/dp/B009F1DUAM/ref=cm_cr-mr-title<br /><br />My main rig:<br /><br />Case: Corsair 650D<br />GPU: EVGA GTX 780<br />CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)<br />PSU: Corsair AX850<br />Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAM<br />SSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GB<br />MB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87<br />OS: Windows 7 64bitre thinking about building an HTPC then Richland is the way to go.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cord was deliverd sooner than expected and it works flawlessly.  My kids run off with my Kindle charging cord, so I purchased this one to keep at work.
B0000024YL|5.0|Like the others I got, memories from long ago, when I was at Ohio state and about 18 years old!! That now seems so long ago!
B004TI5N38|4.0|David Baldacci always delivers! From tender love stories to down and dirty thrillers he keeps me turning the pages.  I hope he develops more story lines for this character.
B0041B785Y|5.0|Meshuggah hasn't let me down yet!  Odd time signatures, lots of double-kicks and brutal downtuned guitars.<br />Same intense styles and yet new layers of timing and sounds.  Keep it up Messhugah and I'll keep buying it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I would not past this book on  I guess I'm not into mysteries  it took me  a bit to get into the book and than  I could not wait for it to be over
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm not sure if its today's style or if its my selection of authors but this read resembled my last: entertaining yet devoid of substance.  It was like biting  into a Philly cheese steak with no steak.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This book was very interesting about one woman's near death experience. It was a bit similar to Proof of Heaven<br />which I enjoyed as well. The only criticism I would give it would be that it repeated itself a lot. Being a writer myself, I noticed it could have been more tightly written. Other than that, a very moving book.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I think the book had funny parts and was a good read. it is not an all time favorite, but it was good.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|Being a fan of historical fiction, I found this movie to fit well on my watch list. Nice love story as well.
B003719GGS|5.0|It will help me to be a better husband and father.  Easily understood and well written.  I heartily recommend it.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I chose this app after using the free version for a while. For $2, it's a good device to have to monitor your power levels and it informs when you need to recharge. Simple to use and it was a quick download. Great.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I've always been big into learning about this history of my ancestors, and knowing I'm of Scandinavian blood really got me enthralled in the world of the Vikings. I've acquired my own mini library of the different Sagas, and literature on their people, myths, and ways.This show has been a great example of both real historical viking people and their lifes, showing the rest of the world that most of their preconceived notions of them are false. While the story in its full entirety isn't 100% historically accurate, they use roughly 80% historically accurate elements. Overall this has to be my favorite show of all time. I love having it on my Kindle HD so I can watch it where ever I'd like.
B0062YADWI|3.0|Small and the metal is thin. Looks like it would break easily, but it was a gift so I never personally tried it out.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|An amazingly talented young woman, whose beauty captivates us all within her looks and of course in her music. This new album with a combination of Dub-Step elements an violin is simply breathe-taking. I hope she continues to push the limits of her potential as an artist and really explore what she can do.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I'm usually not into sci-fi/super power type movies, but absolutely loved this movie! I would recommend it to anybody, good story line. I would like to see a sequel.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I could listen to this album everyday (and I do).  The songs relate well to each other but there is variety and innovation in every piece.
B00969PR18|5.0|It is an excellent tool in order to worldwide localization on my kindle.<br />It is perfect for my studies, navigation on touch screen is a great experience.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Eureka is one of the best science fiction shows on television ever.  Imaginative concepts, creative, well-plotted, wonderful characters and relationships, great special effects, lots of action and humor, it's great fun!
044042321X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend, who loves the Game of Thrones series, just like me. I saw the book and immediately felt jealous that I was giving it away! The art style and look of the characters is very different to the TV series but it's still amazing and feels like you're seeing the books come to life! I've read the book series too and the graphic novel follows the story very well and gives you a stunning following of the plot.<br /><br />It does only include part of the first book, however, so it is incomplete so-to-speak. I plan on buying the next volume when it comes out- a lovely novel to have.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre in 3D. I liked it a lot, is it the original? No but what is? What I am furious about is the money grab that Disney is doing with the 3D disc. Only offering the 3D and DVD but still at a premium price? Disney should be ashamed of itself for this blatant grab at the consumer's wallet. This isn't an Amazon issue but maybe Amazon can provide feedback to Disney that Disney could have sold a whole lot more of these if they had bundled it correctly. I refuse to help Disney with this blatant rip-off.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A co-worker recommended it to me and I said I'd add it to my extremely long reading list. He told me I should put it at the top and so I made it the next thing I read. It was so compelling that I couldn't put it down. I finished it and moved onto the Shift Omnibus. The characters, setting and plot are all fantastic and I really can't thank my co-worker enough. Now I just hope that if/when the movie comes out that it does this book some justice.
B00CTXBO9M|3.0|This game is perfect for kids when your trying to get things done and it ain't just for kids adults can play it too. If you shopping with your noisy kid or waiting for a doctor's appointment or anything else this game can come in handy.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|I read the book and tried to compare them. The book seemed to have more excitement than the movie. It is Ok.
B001NHNG64|4.0|fast pace not very predictable. very enjoyable read. would recommend for anyone that enjoys a good spy thriller. I will be buying more from this series
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is one of the better books of the series.  I feel like we moved ahead in the story, finally.  But I so want a resolution!<br />I'm always surprised at who has been killed off in Martin's books.  This time, we don't know who is still around to play in the next round of the Game!
B00CQGU9GG|4.0|I give the music five stars, of course, but the remastering only gets three. Here's why -- the mastering on these ten CDs is a mixed bag. First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, Fandango, Tejas and Eliminator all appear in remastered versions. To me they sound great, although some will no doubt take issue with the fact that they have been brickwalled. Unfortunately, Deguello, El Loco, Afterburner and Recycler have not been remastered and appear to be the original CD masters. My guess is that Warners remastered the first five albums to restore the original mixes and used the Eliminator remaster from the 2008 deluxe edition and called it a day. It seems like if they were going to the effort to put out this collection they could have gone ahead and remastered the remaining four records to offer the best possible sound. That said, it's great to finally have the original mixes restored for the earlier records and you can't beat the music or the price.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Really well done. I have enjoyed every episode from the beginning. A great original series that captivates the audience from the start
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I have no idea how much of this book is factual. Probably a lot of it in a general way, but I suspect a lot of &#34;artistic license&#34; was taken in writing it. In the big picture however, it presents a lot very real philosophy and I know from other sources that some of the research presented is accurate as the researchers have described it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book. It is great fun and very worth thinking about. It is hard to beat that combination.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Being an old Star Trek fan (really old!) I didn't believe that a new movie would top the ones before. I was wrong! The story line and the acting far exceeded my expectations. Watched it several times.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This documentary includes interviews with past and present Eagles' members.  It is a very thorough and insightful review of how the band started and continued throughout so many years.  The one thing that stands out for me is that Glenn Frey is even more smug and arrogant than Don Henley.  I always thought it was the other way around.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best puzzle game played yet! I can't wait for the next one. So good that it's the first game that I felt deserved to be rated.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|One of the best tv shows I've watched. Love the creativeness and the thinking outside the box concepts I this show. You won't be disappointed. Start at the beginning and watch all of the episodes. If you like science fiction you will like this show.
0425263916|1.0|Unquestionably the worst and most boring book I''ve read in a least a year.  it has zero plot, zero. Very little character development beyond the first book.  I finished it but only to see if Sylvia Day could salvage it with the tiniest glimmer of a story line.  Nope.<br />I'm looking at all these four and five star There are some great romance novels out there, full of great characters, great story lines and hot love scenes. You could start with Lisa Kleypas or Linda Howard.  And of course Nora Roberts is always a good bet.  But there's got to be more to a \\"book\\" than two people constantly having sex and saying and thinking the same things about one another for 300 pages. I'm done with Sylvia Day.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book captivated me from the very beginning and until the very end.<br />Heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time, I doubt it would have been possible to read this and not shed any tears. There are no words, it was just so beautiful.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning. There are so many plot twists you never know what's coming next.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|For the most part, this is downright golden! As Rubin and the band have said, this is mainly a visit to the early days. But here's what I hear: old-school elements that are not overdone, a sprinkling of FX (though no keys of course), an unexpected liveliness, dashes and chunks of newer ideas and surprises, and an undeniable continued relevance. One reviewer said that it plods, and that opinion almost had me skipping this purchase. To me, this may plod for an approximate grand total of 10 out of 53 minutes. In other words, where it might plod or get a bit repetitive, I actually appreciate it because it recalls that element of the 70s. Ozzy sounds perfectly back at home, Geezer makes his presence known throughout, Brad is plenty adept, and of course, Tony, unmistakable and innovative. I'll be the first to say that Bill might end up regretting his sky-out (if it was financial). If it was physical, God bless him, and all involved in this miraculous slab o' Sab.<br /><br />As another said, the BestBuy 4 extra tracks are faster and thoroughly solid. I think BS separated the faster ones in order to maintain the ambiance and the concept of the main album.<br /><br />For those still on the fence - don't forget, this is the latest from the legendary Iommi. And on a thunderous system, no regrets whatsoever!
193700788X|3.0|The best thing way to put this is it could be a 30 minute sitcom. In fact everything was tied up in a pretty little bow at the end and everyone lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER.  The author managed to find a way to take a storyline that has had surprise after surprise and make the ending predictable. If you have read the series you can guess not only the end pretty early in the story but what she considers the \\"turns\\" in the story that are suppose to shock you. At times the painfully clear path the story is taking becomes boring and simple. If you want your sookie series to have a neat and clean ending for everyone (and believe me I mean EVERYONE) something tied you in a bow you will love the book. Overall it's not bad I just expected more of the book. This book is truly dependent on how you want the story to end and not an ending in and over itself.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Other than the cloud issue good game. If an app can only be used on one device it is a rip off in my eyes!!!
B008GPODCM|5.0|I read this after Aces book<br />It is a clearer story of the band in many ways the same story through different eyes.<br /><br />KISS fans will love all these books. Shame the original band is gone
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best Dexter Series yet. Acting was good and story line is excellent. I have seen every episode of Dexter for all 6 seasons and so far I like this season the best
B00957T6X6|3.0|I've read better series, but I've also read worse series. It's like if Brian Jacques wrote about humans and marketed it for adults.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Works great on my Kindle.  Now I can access my calendar on my Kindle anytime I need it and make updates to it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  Cannot wait for season 4 to start.  The writers are super.  How can that much tragedy fall on one family?
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My kids and I really like this game. It's really cute. The problem is it's quite buggy and rarely connects to other people's ponyvilles on social media. Since some tasks require that it's really annoying.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|great game. very good grafics. awesome with the 3d. but it needs more levels. but all in all. awesome. I highly recommend it to everyone
B00364K6YW|5.0|I had seen the BBC television version of this movie when it was first released--in fact, we watched it in English class.  Those of you who also saw the television version will be pleasantly surprised to discover that the restored edition DVD contains deleted scenes!  This beautifully constructed movie is a faithful reproduction of the Austen novel, and it is obvious that care was taken to ensure authenticity.  Unlike the more recent U.S. version, you will not find young ladies resting their elbows on the dinner table or prancing about unchaperoned in this movie.  The acting is superb, the costumes are historically accurate, and the dialogue comes straight from the novel.  If Jane Austen were alive, methinks she would place her stamp of approval on this production.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love the game!  It is very addictive.  It is surprising how much fun it is.  Especially with the addition of Dino World.
B00361HV02|1.0|Beat the devil's tattoo is the only good track on this CD, what happened? I know their NEW drummer is a smoking hot lady but that doesn't translate int the music being any better, the tracks were boring and redundant very repetitive and without any spark or IDK I just couldn't get into it as I could in their previous records.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|It is fine.  It does what it is supposed to do but it did not help the problem I was having.
1616550414|5.0|This makes a fantastic gift no matter what your age is as long as you have an affinity for all things Zelda.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|In dramatic form, the film shows the evils of the prison system and the corruption of those running it.  At the same time, it is entertaining.  As a life-long worker in corrections, my heart broke when the Morgan Freeman character declined to break out of prison because &#34;I'm an institutional man now.&#34;  Finally broken, finally defeated.  How sad.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|A new twist on a old tale, loved it. Yes they do curse a little bit in the movie but the action was great.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|Decided to get the complete album as I was tired of my playlist of this and that. Its a classic and some of Prince's very best.
B00002E23E|5.0|This movie & soundtrack amazes me anew each time: like a companion to the 4th album. But it's not for critics or rock fans who LIKE LedZep: it's for people who either LOVE Zeppelin, or at least LOVE some thing for its precious charm & mystique. Like many reviewers, I too dismiss all negative reviews by bozos, wiseasses, & middleminds. If one isn't trying to be cute picking it apart, one is open to a very rewarding piece of Zep art: only a fool critcizes Zeppelin for underachieving at what ONLY Zeppelin could imagine. Zep was always about rock magically elevating life to higher state, so complaints about \\"authenticity\\" are puny nitpicks for puny minds. Symbolically, the fantasy sequences make alot people uncomfortable so they resort to labeling them as cheesy: again, this is ignorant, like trying to win a poker game with a Tarot deck.  It's not cinema or tv, it's a rock fantasy home movie, not edited for an Oscar; just personal dream sequences about Inner Courage, staged for 70's celluloid.<br />No matter how many people get used to Zeppelin, the Wonder of Zeppelin is also their Message. Zeppelin is the opposite of habitually measuring with known parameters. Losers posing as historians often take points off from the Heartbreaker solo for execution: as if there were other electric guitar solo breaks to compare then!  Likewise, if someone can show me a more coherent movie that punctuates an arena show with euphoric medieval fans & fantasies, and the urgency of hot rods, motorcycle cops, & rowdy fans made BEFORE this movie- then I'll be willing to admit shortcomings. While you're at it; WHO PLAYED KASHMIR BETTER BEFORE LZ?<br /> As great as Zep sounds in studio, most of these performances EXCEL or in different ways MATCH what made the studio versions interesting. Many hard rock fans don't appreciate how Jimmy Page's sound is cleaner: outgrowing his early vision of sustaining fuzz, here Page is reacting to his guitars'  precious woody tone with wonder & subtlety rather than executing wellrehearsed pyrotechnics for show. Why he outstrips peers like JGarcia & JHendrix is his scope for pushing the blues envelope along with Asian & Middle Eastern & Celtic pastoral vistas- not as a master, but as a cartographer sketching undiscovered territory with only pencil & paper. This film is pure Led Zeppelin because it accidentally appeals to more people than it should, so there's big riffs for the little guy, threaded among unpolished details that contain passageways to the Hidden. Before you see the Light, joy & terror look the same in the Dark.

1439156816|5.0|Whether you love or hate Stephen King's stories, you have to agree that he is a prolific writer. In this book he explains his own craft and how he got there. I found each chapter enlightening. Many times I found that he crystallized ideas that I myself knew and many other times, I learned to see things in a new light. Particularly, I loved his description of the writing process as &#34;finding a fossil&#34;. I think this best describes the process of fiction writing more than anything I have ever heard. The biographical segments are beautiful and by the end of the book, you will learn a lot more about writing and also the author. I absolutely loved it
B00BBW16HW|5.0|From start to finish this movie is beautifully filmed and acted. It's full of continuous wonderful moments and surprises. I saw it when it first came out and then watched it again on video, as I wanted my husband to see it.  I was charmed and delighted all over again, and my husband, who is pretty picky about movies loved it. We kept exclaiming afterwards \\"wow that was Good!\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable makes your mind brain work hard will be playing this till the end I hope. Good for long journeys and better than other similar games.

0545123291|5.0|I chose to listen to Linger in audiobook format. I was really really hoping they'd replace the old-man Sam voice from the Shiver audiobook with someone else in this book... and thank goodness they brought in Pierce Cravens to play Sam. It was so nice to listen without the pervish voice of old-man Sam. But the narrators for Isabelle and Cole were even better. Cole's voice! My oh my! I googled the narrator's name (Dan Bittner) and was a little disappointed to see that he doesn't look anything like the image I conjured from his voice, so I've given myself the rule that I can no longer look up the narrators on google to see what they look like. If I had to decide, I would say that Linger  is probably my favorite book out of the trilogy. The four POVs worked like a dream in this. Before starting, I was a little concerned about four narrators, but getting to know Cole and Isabelle was one of the best parts of the books. And surprisingly, Isabelle became my favorite character. I just love her!<br /><br />For more of my reviews and book stuff check out my blog @ [...]

0545123275|4.0|I listened to the audiobook version of Shiver read by Jenna Lamia and David LeDoux. Lamia was an excellent choice for Grace, but I have no idea what anyone was thinking choosing LeDoux as the voice of Sam. He sounded like a 50 year old man, and his \\"female\\" voice when trying to speak Grace's parts from Sam's POV was like having my father mimic a 12 year old girl. So it was freakishly pervy at worst and laughable at best. However, I fell in love with the story of Sam and Grace, so I kept listening. The concept of  weather affecting the wolve's shifting was an interesting take on the wolf thing. It's always nice to see something different come to the big cannon of werewolf lore. And Sam and Grace's relationship! Wow. Could any guy be more adorable than Sam? What's more, the two connected from the start and no other love interest was thrown in! Brownie points to Steifvater for going sans love-triangle.<br /><br />For more of my reviews and book stuff check out my blog @ [...]
1476715904|5.0|I find it difficult to review books that truly touch me on a personal level. Primarily because it brings me back to my own personal experiences and in order to make you understand why I love the book... first, I'd have to tell you MY story. Well, not gonna' do that... not enough space on amazon for that! Because I understand loss/death and have experienced it first hand... this book drew me in quickly and had me at hello.<br />It's also very rare to find books that actually portray young people in a good way. No, they are not all sex crazed alcoholics sneaking out to do things behind their parents backs. Yes, many of them... quite a few actually... are smart, strong and have good relationships with their parents and love their siblings. I love how the young people are portrayed in this book.<br />I loved every character... the mom, Eddie and her boyfriend, the little brothers... they all had their own story to share and so it wasn't just a story of Will and Layken... it was a story of how life blends us all together and shows us when some doors close... others open. And, sometimes we have to build new families to replace old ones.<br />The author very cleverly built this story around poetry. And, because I love poetry it made the journey even better. I cried bucket loads at the end. But, I'm a mom... and the topics in this book cover some of our deepest fears as mothers. So, of course I cried. I want to say more... I really do... but, this book is so much better if you do not know what to expect. I had not read any of the reviews but had heard it was a good one and now I'm glad I went in blind. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I'm just wondering if I need to stock up on some Kleenex first.
0545259096|4.0|Like with Shiver and Linger, I again listened to the audiobook, and thankfully old-man Sam was still gone and teenage sounding Sam was telling us about life without Grace. Again, I was enamored with Isabelle, and Cole is truly a perfect companion for her, but not at all in a Sam/Grace kind of way. I think we all would agree that the connection between Sam and Grace is hardly based in the world of reality, and that Cole and Isabelle's relationship is a little more true-to-life. But that doesn't make us enjoy Sam and Grace's story any less. As for the story, Forever was a fitting conclusion to the series. I'd read a few reviews saying the ending was too ambiguous and didn't leave the reader with any closure. So I was really nervous about the ending leaving me with too many questions. I'm not the kind of reader that likes to end a series without feeling like I know where the characters are going from here. I think Sam and Grace work out in the end. I was okay with the ending, though a little sad to see the series finished. I would love to see a spin-off featuring Isabelle and Cole.<br /><br />For more of my reviews and book stuff check out my blog @ [...]

B008220BLG|4.0|\\"Romantic zombie comedy\\" - three words you don't normally see together when describing a film, but it adds up to some extreme coolness here.  'Warm Bodes' stars Nicholas Hoult (definitely one of the best actors, of his generation, working today) as \\"R\\" (he can't remember what his name was), a zombie in some future time when zombies have driven all the humans into walled fortresses of their own, who - even though he groans and slouches around and eats humans - still has a brain that can think and reason, to some degree.  R narrates the story, a functioning mind stuck in a zombie body ... until, during a particularly brutal fight between the humans and zombies, he catches sight of a beautiful young girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer), who literally makes his heart skip a beat - for the first time since he became part of the undead!  Unknowingly killing Julie's ex-boyfriend in the fight, R's nature takes over and he starts eating the dead guy's brains; eating brains is R's thing, and probably what's keeping him partially human inside, because in this film when a zombie eats a human's brains he/she also sees their memories; their hopes, fears and dreams.  R falls in love with Julie in that moment, and actually fends off the other zombies to pull her to safety, taking her to an abandoned airplane he's set up, at the airport, as his home.<br /><br />The more time he spends with Julie, the more human he becomes, and as he finally relents to helping her get back to her home and father (played by John Malkovich, and the leader of the walled city of people trying to kill off all the zombies), not only does R become more and more human again ... the change in him starts a chain reaction in the rest of the zombie horde, raising a possible hope for the future of the human race.<br /><br />This film is a comedy, zombie pic, bromance (R's best zombie buddy M, as played by Rob Corddry, is terrific - though I didn't buy him as a zombie as much as I did Hoult), and romantic tale of love conquers all; ultimately uplifting, and while not the perfect film I would hope that even those who aren't normally into zombie flicks will give it a go; it IS that good.conquers all; ultimately uplifting, and while not the perfect film I would hope that even those who aren't normally into zombie flicks will give it a go; it IS that good.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Good story, great acting, excellent effects.  Story concept is, well, hard to grasp, but is worth watching over and over..
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The 2012 version of 'Les Miserables' was my first time seeing ANY version of the Victor Hugo classic, and in the very beginning it took me a bit to get into it - though once I did I really loved the story, the music, and how it all played out on-screen.<br /><br />The 19th-century story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), who spends his life running from police captain Javert (Russell Crowe), after violating his parole (he'd been in prison for the \\"heinous\\" crime of stealing a loaf of bread to feed his starving sister's child), takes a new turn when Valjean also promises to care for the infant daughter of Fantine (Anne Hathaway's Oscar-winning role) when he feels responsible for Fantine's death.  How caring for Cosette changes Valjean's life, and perception of living - all in the middle of the French Revolution - makes for a grand-scale musical and, in the end, an emotionally touching film about sacrifice and love (corny-sounding, but true).  The incomparable Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, as the insanely greedy innkeepers the Thenardiers, are so pitch-perfect in their comedy relief of all this drama, you may be tempted to hit the \\"back\\" button on your remote just to watch their scenes again.<br /><br />A wonderful film.
B007G5K066|5.0|This has to be one of the most intelligent spy movies ever made.  Story is engrossing and and is true to the novel.  Unfortunately you have the watch the movie several times to understand completely what is going on, The screenwriters did a very good job in adapting it to the screen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. Way  better than the movie.  Genuine story line and very well written. Second time reading it and I enjoyed it just the same.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book has culture and emotion in every page. Complex yet easy to follow the story takes you up and down in the best of ways.
B003YTPS7O|4.0|This movie follows the book somewhat, but sadly, it omits the interesting and intriguing mystery that is solved as a significant part of the book.  I enjoyed it anyway because of the beauty of the region of France in which the movie is set.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent representation of an Historical time in our country.  Even though the characters as named, were fiction, you have the feeling that this situation represented the actual experiences of many of those children.  I was surprised to learn that nearly all of my friends had no idea that this transport of children even happened.  Only my Mother's generation and my U.S. history buff friends new of this time.  I suspect many more of my friends will be reading this book also.  I allowed them to brouse my Kindle for a short preview and they were hooked.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|After R (a highly unusual zombie) saves Julie from an attack, the two form a relationship that sets in motion a sequence of events that might transform the entire lifeless world.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think of this prior to renting and decided to take a chance on a different kind of zombie movie and warm bodies is definitely different. I would describe this movie as a romance comedy that tends to be a little hokey at times with the comedy part of it but does have its moments of cuteness. Surprisingly there is a bit more action than I anticipated especially with the &#34;boneys&#34; that actually help make the movie a bit more entertaining as there are some spots that tend to drag on, especially with the record playing.<br /><br />Overall this movie is a decent rent to watch if you are looking for something a little different than the ordinary, although maybe not for kids that are too young as the scenes with the boneys could be scary for adults with young ones
B0038P59A0|4.0|A very played role by Robert Downey Jr. He NEVER disappoints. Action and slight comic...a real good flick. I enjoy it.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.<br /><br />I will say that I was not familiar with the novel prior to watching this movie so I cant judge whether the movie did the book justice.  I was intrigued with the theme of the film with its mixture of lives interwoven in the fabric of time.  After watching this movie for 3 hours, (Yes it is a long one), I will say that the movie has a very complex storyline and I could see why theatergoers had a difficult time with it.  I think I gained a better understanding watching comfortably at home trying to grasp the concepts in this than I would have been at the theater.  Cloud Atlas reminds me quite a bit of Crash or Traffic in its theme of inter-relatedness.<br /><br />I will say that I was impressed at the multiple roles that Hanks, Berry and others played throughout the movie.  The makeup was so outstanding at times that I didn't recognize who they were until the end credits played.  I thought some of the stories within the movie played better than others and were more entertaining at times to the extent that some of these could have been movies on there own.<br /><br />The movie was done well however, I think could have been weaved together a bit more smoothly for people like me that aren't familiar with the book.  This movie is very complex and can be difficult to follow at times especially if you aren't familiar with the backstory.  I also thought Crash especially did a bit better job with the type of concept that Cloud Atlas does.  That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy Cloud Atlas.  After the movie finished, it provided great conversation on what the movie said to you and even though the movie had some flaws, I found it to be enjoyable and entertaining 3 and half star movie.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|My daughter recommended this movie.  Though animation, it was so true to life. The storyline was great. What a feat to bring to life this character, Mr. Frederickson. I laughed and i cried. I hurt and i healed. The creators of this film should be commended for so accurately portraying human emotion and spirit on so many levels. Well done.
B00AM0C6YG|4.0|I heard the song &#34;Is anybody out there?&#34; on public radio a few months ago prior to its release in the US.  That was the song that got me to buy this CD.  The rest of the songs were good too, giving it a 4 star rating from me.
B000059XUP|1.0|Even those I was pleased with the actor they got for the lead role.The story line was so bad.It was so disappointing.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I couldn't pull myself away. Well worth the price. I didn't want the game to end please come up with another one that's longer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Instructions would be nice, but didn't take long to figure things out. I will definitely sit with the young kids and let them play. It will challenge their reasoning and intuitive skills. I'm sure they will want more levels.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I have always loved the tale of the frog prince.  So, when I heard of The Princess and the Frog, I thought I would give it a try.  There is no doubt about it.  This movie is a lot of fun.  I think the music was my favorite aspect of the movie.  The music was so happy and upbeat, which, in my opinion, helps make disney movies so great.  I also liked the irony of the princess turning into a frog when she kissed the frog prince.  I would happily recommend this movie to anyone.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|Like the amount of songs in here!!  Have tried other apps and this one is far superior. Would recommend to anyone

B008OOYALE|5.0|I'm at level 12 right now on kindle and the game is flawless. I love it. good job Sarah's island! bet it took awhile to get that far. the dragons are adorible and fun to watch. I have to say my favorite so far is the wild dragon. very rare. I was lucky to get my little guy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was epic. I had a lot of fun reading it.it's all about friendship. Greg is the odd man out until an twist happens and gets Greg a date. But what about Rowley? Oh you will see.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you enjoy the legal thriller genre, this is worth reading.  It isn't exactly a thriller, but it certainly makes you think about both sides of the case and try to predict where the defense and prosecution are heading.  It has some good twists and turns and the author has done a great job of presenting Jacob from both perspectives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|BEST GAME OF THE WORLD I KNOW I PREFER A NEW LISTING OF THE THE WORLD I AM AM AM AM AM AM A LITTLE TOO TOO MUCH OF MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT BIT MORE OF OF THE THE THE THE
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|As you would suspect, this is a superb album.  Glad to hear Iommi's great licks again. Ozzy sounds good as well.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Did not work for me. Alarm did not go off! Could be me, but it is not user friendly. It has now been removed from my apps.
B00CISC2DA|3.0|I've read a few reviews now that are similar to my feelings on this album.  I can't say I don't like it; but it's very challenging for me.  Let me see if I can explain this a little bit better.  I have been a fan of about 85% of Boards of Canada's material up to this point.  So, I suppose my expectations for this album were quite high.  Each BoC release (including their EPs) has its own character and identity that holds it together as a truly wonderful musical experience.  This feeling is completely lacking on this release.  It's not to say this is not unmistakably BoC. It certainly has their trademark stamped all over it.  My initial listening experience went as follows:  First, I noticed that this was not a step forward for Boards.  This was definitely a set of pieces that revisited some of their earliest work.  I didn't have a problem with this aspect; aside from being a fan of how each LP sort of progressed and became more elegant (for lack of better word) as the band aged.  The second thing I noticed was that there seemed to be an almost unnecessary amount of repetition on each track.  I'm not going to sit here and deny that you have to be a fan of repetition to get into Boc, because that would totally be untrue; but it seemed that most of the repetition on this album had a \\"We don't know where else to take this\\" feel to it.  Typically, a Boards of Canada song at least has some building and some change throughout; not the case with these tracks.  So, I got to the tenth track or so and finally thought something special was starting to happen; but realized that the few tracks near the end of the album that are the standouts of the album still did not stack up with BoC's best material.  I also ended up realizing, recently, that none of the tracks really evoked any sort of emotion in me.  The excellent apocalyptic artwork and mysterious build-up to the release of this album implied a feeling that just is not there when you listen to the tracks.  There's no familiarcharacter or identity to this album that will ultimately keep me coming back time and time again like all the previous works of this group have done.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|I second this game for anyone who likes to blow stuff up.  This game will eat up hours of overdone.<br /><br />Zer
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys and can follow the witty remarks and jokes in the series. I think it is really well done.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a very good game to play for all ages...I'm 14 and I love playing this game when I'm bored...the little pudding monsters are acute and it has challenging levels...though for some they may be pretty easy...a definite download
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This was different to any other book that've read, it's far fetched but I couldn't put it down finding it quite amusing at times. The tales of one man's adventures that kept you wondering what could possibly happen next. Loved it!
B00005MP58|5.0|I am a Jane Austen fan, and this mini-series follows the book closely. Movies, including the latest one, try to modernize too much. I think students would benefit more if the series were presented to them as a visual image of the period.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enjoyable yet somewhat sad characters. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and could picture the scenery and hear the accents of The Irish. Well written.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great CPU, extremely fast, chews thru games and CPU intensive apps like video editing and encoding like nothing, plus the unlocked multiplier gives you the chance to overclock it, if you're going this route i'd advise getting an aftermarket cooler (it's kind of obvious). Excellent for gaming and everyday use
B004KKYX9K|5.0|What's not to love about a Jodi Piccoult novel with the twists and turns of a coaster ride. Love her books, have read several and am yet to be disappointed. Currently reading another!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was a little ticked that I now have to wait for another book, but I can't wait to see what will happen with Eva and Gideon.  All 3 books have been good I loved all three.  This one has a lot of sex in it, which could be a little gratuitous, but overall a good read.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|If you like QOTSA this album should not disappoint you. It's different from previous QOTSA albums but that's the point of getting something new and fresh. Although this album is more dark than fun it's still giving the raw, witty, cynical, super-cool pleasure that we've come to expect from Josh Homme and his musical partners.
006019250X|5.0|It came in great condition thank you my daughter loved the book and I will be getting more of his books in the future.

1781162646|5.0|I like how King has written a for Donald Westlake tribute in the front of this.  Like that late great master who often was criticised for fans only wanting to read another comic caper, when he wrote a great story in a different genre, so too many may dismiss, or even criticise Joyland for not being a horror novel, the genre King is of course the master of.  King has of course written many a highly successful and praised non horror story such as The Body (Stand by Me) or Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption to name but two.  This is actually the second time he's contributed something to Hard Case Crime, a publisher who exists to bring back the fond memories of the old dime store paperback, or let younger people such as myself get feel for what that era was like with interesting cover artwork (that's usually a scene that's not in the book as is the case here, although the girl in the green dress is a character in the book).  His previous submission was The Colorado Kid (also a non horror tale), I think this one is better than that book and Joyland also has a clear ending.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Joyland, what makes King such a great writer in his masterpiece novels (and I wouldn't put this up there with It, Carrie and the other classics but I'd still rate Joyland five stars) is the way he paints the picture of the everyday things that happen to and in the minds of his characters.  As a reader you can relate to things these characters are thinking, have done or play on their mind (such as the opposite sex) in their day to day existence.  A large amount of the pages of his horror novels have this sort of following the characters' lives through their eyes side story going on which is what makes those books so great. That's what Joyland basically is, a through the eyes of side story of a young guy who takes a job at a small amusement park before returning to uni, as a story on its own (it's only 283 pages, a longer length than most authors call novels but a lot shorter than your average King one). The descriptions of the daily life, good and bad of the Joyland theme park, including the daunting \\"wearing the fur\\", along with other challenges for Devin Jones, a young guy determined to help others enjoy their day. Devin also becomes a bit obsessed with the few decades old murder that happened in the fright house of a young woman whose throat was slashed. Joyland incredibly descriptive and enjoyable reading.  I could almost smell the hotdogs and popcorn as I turned the pages.shorter than your average King one).

B0051XQI84|5.0|Great movie! Enjoyed watching it with my younger siblings. Good animation as well. Overall, I would probably watch it again with kids I babysit for.
B0015DWLD0|2.0|Book club choice but I found it difficult to get into. Too repetitive. Maybe I just don't have patience for the 'journal' format any more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun the best game ever actually it is great the Miami one is good and so was the Japanese one is fun before I go to bed I play it
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Thought provoking stories and presentations. Something to keep the mind alive and lead you to more research. Good job Ted.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Love the game just wish I didn't have to pat cash for some things my kids love the game to n not to many of my friends play so it hard to get some items but it's ok
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|App well designed to enable keeping track of current and former contacts and reaching out to new contacts quickly and easily.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it; prefer the classic form though. So glad you had it for free. Thank you so much for it.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Attractive format and presentation makes for ease of finding stories of interest. Balanced reporting and analysis adds to the attraction.
B002APU580|5.0|This is my favorite movie. Now I need a word count so I'll add this. Matthew McFaydden is the best Darcy I've ever seen (and I'm a huge Colon Firth fan). He is more believable. This whole movie has more believable characters then other versions (especially that 1938 version with Claudette Colbert where everyone is &#34;Darling&#34; and they all smile to much). The cast is stellar. The direction is top shelf! If you haven't seen it,  you will love it.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Django Unchained is a 2012 American western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film stars Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson. Set in the South two years before the Civil War, Django Unchained stars Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx as Django, a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with German-born bounty hunter Dr. Read More. Great price, Good Moive.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie is just the gift to give for Christmas to someone who needs to feel the season. It takes off with several lives and converges on one theme.. Love. Yes, it's 10 years old. Who cares. The theme still goes on. If you want a preview, go to You Tube. I only wish they had included Jason Isaac in this movie also. He played Malfoy's father in all the Potter movies.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I have enjoyed all 8 seasons of 24.  Season 8 is one of the best.  I can hardly wait for Season 9.
0679805273|5.0|a great book for graduates - have given it as a grad present before. No matter whhat level a student has achieved this book is appicable.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|My daughter has gotten me hooked on this show!  It has everything I love about entertainment - comedy, drama, suspense, action... Great characters that make you love them, like them or hate them.  The guys aren't bad looking, either!  I'm looking forward to adding this season to our collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The family loved this series and the show is so much better seeing all the shows in the correct order.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I bought this while looking at many different options.  This model is very accurate!  There have been countless times that I, or someone else in my foursome have switched clubs based and the reading and have been right to do so.  Now that it is so cheap this is a must buy to improve your golf game!!!
B000AS4L16|5.0|I've seen a lot of Holocaust documentaries...Night and Fog, Memory of the Camps, etc. Although each Holocaust documentary is unique and informative, none of the documentaries I've seen come close to the emotion evoked by Shoah. For those who can't get enough of learning about the Jewish people and their struggles, as well as their ability to survive the unmentionable horrors of the Holocaust, this is a must-see.<br /><br />Long but never verbose, this documentary should be mandatory viewing for all high school and college-age students. In fact, everyone should watch it.<br /><br />Spectacular--absolutely spectacular.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Loved the first two books,but it appears the author is running out of ideas or add ideas that are not interesting. The book lacked substance. I can't believe the series is not done.....REALLY!!!!. Not looking forward to next book. I am over this story line that is not going anyway or concluding. The author has ruined a perfect love storyline, just to sell more books. I am tired of continuing a series just to sell more books. I want a refund
B0054SMID0|5.0|all of michael connelys books should be made into movies but this one was especially good. read the book first
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I found the book to be rather slow. I found myself just waiting for the story to get better unfortanetly it didn't.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I bought this on a whim because I liked the one or two songs I had heard from The Lumineers. The entire album is really great - it's rare to find an album where I enjoy every single one of the songs, but this is one of those albums.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|The boys from Florida Georgia Line did an outstanding job on this album. A couple of other songs could become radio hits.
1442359919|3.0|I kept waiting for vintage King to show up but he never did.  The story was a light read.  No thinking required.  I love Stephen King, don't get me wrong.  He just did not show up in this book.
030758836X|4.0|Entertaining read. As a Missouri native, I'm highly annoyed at the naming of the town of \\"North Carthage\\". I wouldn't mind if Carthage wasn't already a town in a totally different part of the state. It just doesn't make sense. There's no reason to make it confusing. I think the pace, the suspense, and the ending could have been done better, but overall I enjoyed the read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A must read even if is not a happy story.  The world need's to know what is going on in North Korea.  It is not some body else problem, the impunity of dictators can not be ignored.
0307477479|3.0|I must be missing something. This book has received so much critical acclaim that I feel like I'm doing something wrong because, the truth is, I didn't like it all that much. It was entertaining, but nothing all that special to me. Part of my dislike probably has to do with the fact that I prefer novels to short stories, and this is really a collection of connected short stories sold as a novel. Maybe I'll read it again eventually to see if I change my mind, but for now I'm just, \\"meh\\" on this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! I wish there was a hint button!  Sometimes the clues are really hard to find.
B005HED08I|2.0|I would certainly be the last one to give a bad rating to a Star Trek TOS episode.  This rating is about the iPad player.<br /><br />I was watching on my home wi fi network with good connectivity.  The episode kept skipping.  20-40 seconds would disappear at a time.  Then when you backed up to get the missed content, it took forever.<br /><br />So I switched to the Netflix player and it worked perfectly.  The player had no playback flaws and had many nice features lacking in the Amazon player.<br /><br />Keep working on the technology Amazon, you are not there yet with the iPad player.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|No problems with game, generally. Just want you to do something about unintentional hints. Hint area is too sensitive  and keeps using hints. Also after completing all initial packs, Jumbo pack is hard to bring up. These too fixes would make it wonderful.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was really hoping this last book would be like the ones in the beginning but its almost like she's bored writing about Sookie.  Wasn't ending I looked for
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This had more twists and (plot) turns than a nasty mountain road. It was a wild wrap up to this series, and if one is a Pendergast fan, this is one to read.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app for free figuring I would try it out and let my daughter play it tomorrow. It was pretty boring but found myself going through the motions when I stumbled upon a &#34;balloon pop&#34;game that showed different piles of balloons in what appears to be a my little pony store setting, with prices on each pile.  Even the prices themselves were written in a fun themed font...it all appeared to be part of the game, so if clicked the $99.99 pile figuring it would take the balance from my PLAY money...when to my surprise it redirected me to an area to actually purchase a hundred dollars worth of my little pony balloons!!!! Thank God I had tried this out before my daughter.  If a 27 year old could be convinced this was all part of the game, a child certainly would.  I am very angered by the fact this app is obviously aimed towards children and not only does it try to entice kids into spending actual money and not only in such a way it could be done accidentally but DOES THERE REALLY NEED TO BE A HUNDRED DOLLAR OPTION ON A MY LITTLE PONY GAME SERIOUSLY???  I find that disturbing that anyone, adult or child, knowingly or not, would even be subjected to that option.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Well righten and if true explains alot of why people have so many health issues and of course can not believe much of what government agencies tell you because they are all bought off!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great diversion if you dont have a lot of time to invest in your game. many different types of short games
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Only wish Kevin Conroy was available for batman's VO. Follows the comic very well, and characterization is spot on. Good flick.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie was pretty good but if you read the books before hand you'll see many gaps in the story.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|It's 2013, and I am just seeing this movie for the first time and I must say that it's very good, funny and different.  That's what I like most about it, for it strays from the norm of what 'comedy' is and therefore it's very unique.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|After watching the first 3 movies in this series I was a bit disappointed that Matt Damon was not in this one. The books were a great read and the previous movies were excellent.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I admit to being some of the many who were not a fan of the 48 frames per minute style in which it was shot.  P Jackson nailed his directing style in LOTR and I wish he had kept to that. I also felt the movie could have been shorter by about 20-30 minutes.  And this is coming from someone who loves long movies.  This one however, I felt the length of it.  I wish that they had stopped the movie after Bilbo escaped Gollum and they got out of the mountain.  They could have had their moment of closure still that way.  But that's just my opinion, and I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ALL.  I loved Bilbo tho, for he is a light and stronger hero to me than Frodo (no offense to Frodo) but Bilbo just seemed to have more gusto.  I liked the dwarves as well, and I actually liked seeing Radagast the Brown, for I missed not seeing him in LOTR.  Many may not remember that he made a brief cameo in Fellowship of the Ring.  I hope this series does something with Glorfindel the elf, because I also missed him in LOTR movie as well.  Gandalf was great too, and I will admit to also liking the stone giants moment.<br /><br />Overall, this is still very much worth watching.  The mistakes that I saw with the film do not stop me from enjoying it because I loved the book and am happy to see it brought to dramatization.
B00760BPOC|5.0|This is a MUST READ. All the othwer books n the series had better come along quickly so I get to read and enjoy them as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the most expansive and beautifully written novels I've ever read. So much work went into this novel you could practically feel the blood, sweat, and tears leaking from its pages. I'm stunned at how amazing this book is. Definitely recommend.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I normally hate these town type games, but this is fun! Super cute characters and decent mini games make for hours of entertainment .
B0009P66TK|5.0|looks and feels super in spite of it's size is very comfortable. The manual however is less than helpful in using the chrono features. I went on their site and the picture of the watch sub dials have different functions than mine I called and they said that they &#34;change them to give the watch more accuracy)???
1419701533|5.0|My daughter is in second grade and loves these books. After buying one and receiving 100% on her AR test...she wanted them all. Even used her own money to purchase the set.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Such a good movie that I'll watch again and again. Great cast, a hilarious script, and songs that you'll be singing along to long after you've watched it.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|IT  MADE A PERFECT GIFT FOR MY COLLEGE STUDENT.  ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IN PERFECT CONDITION this was a blast from the past and so funny the adults really enjoyed it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great science fiction story told with a unique writing style. The plot moves at the right pace, keeping the readers attention, but also bringing the characters to life.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be reading the second book Shift.  I also have enjoyed the audio version of Wool.

B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm a long time fan of the Sookie Stackhouse series, but I was rather disappointed in this last book. I felt as though there should have been more to her story, and that the ending was rushed.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Im really surprised about this series. Although a bit graphic and gory it was so much better than I expected. I think it's cool  how each season has a different theme. I look forward to watching season 3!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was one of the funnest books I've EVER read. It was written from only the male perspective and was literally laugh out loud hilarious. The character was all man, but funny and entertaining and you couldn't help but to LOVE Drew. It was a fast, entertaining, but also quality read. I will be first in line to read whatever else this author puts out. Excellent!!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|This app keeps my grandsons busy for an hour. The 2 year old loves popping the balloons.well worth the $.99
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was an amazing read. And I think a lot of people I know and in the world would enjoy this book because it is inspiring to show that when you have a tough time it can get better.
B0055PMJMW|2.0|It was a difficult read as the stories seemed not to flow as I have enjoyed before.  Also, stories seemed similar to other seperate story books.  It seemed like it was put together to meet a deadline without much refinement as I usually experience.  Still really enjoy other books.
159463176X|5.0|This book had a slow start.  I wasn't sure where it was going.  However half way through it got better and better.  By 75% it was wonderful.  A beautiful, lovely story about life and love.  Highly recommend it.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feed my is a simple to use blog/news reader for my Kindle Fire HD. The updates are quick, and the interface is colorful and easy to usr.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|All CGI.....all the time. I understand it might be tough acting in front of the blue screen...particularly not having feedback from another actor. Just trying to get the computer generated characters and flesh and blood actors to interact in a proper fashion was lost in this film. The eye contact wouldn't line up when the human was conversing with the computer character...and vice-versa. The actor was looking at a shoulder and not at the generated face. The fantasy images of the land of OZ really looked synthetic...<br /><br />  James Franco didn't help the credibility of the film. I could think of ten actors that could have done a far more credible job with the lead character. Miss Kunis and Miss Williams did their best to salvage what they could.... A rental for kids? The kids would enjoy...and the message is good.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The acting is better than anything I've ever seen.  The writing is amazing.  The show collectively is gripping and frightening and crazy.  Totally hooked!!
B00D2K40WY|1.0|this app is horrible. the app is like all the rest. you cant even cut the hair the way you wanna. it surprises me that so many people would like this app. the effect or backgrounds ate horrible.
1781162646|4.0|I have been reading Stephen King's books since I was just a girl... I remember trembling as I read Carrie, Pet Sematary, and Salem's Lot.  I remember being on the edge of my seat as I read The Stand, The Shining, and It.  I remember being thrilled by Eyes of the Dragon, and crying over Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile.  I think The Green Mile books were his last great work before the accident.  I am SO GLAD he wasn't taken from me, the Constant Reader, and I have persevered through less great and okay works through the years hoping and praying that somewhere, Stephen would break back into a run.  I think that jog started with Under the Dome.  I really enjoyed the idea of the story and the cast of characters was in true King fashion.  Then 11/22/63 came out and I knew he was back (especially with the weaving of tales when Bev and Richie show up in Derry)!  Joyland is the first book I have ever pre-purchased before release.  I couldn't wait for it to come out and I truly honored the fact that SK likes the bound book as opposed to the e-book.  (No offense intended e-book readers, I simply prefer the sound of the turning page, the smell of the paper, and the feel of the cover gripped in my mitts)  I absolutely love the gorgeous pulpy cover.  This is King at some of his story telling best... He's so great at capturing the feel of a place.  I felt like I had seen the Heaven's Bay area with my own two eyes.  He even nails the personality and character of the dog in this story.<br />I felt like I was younger myself when I read this book as I went back in history for the tale.  It was great.  If you have been on an SK hiatus or you thought maybe he just wasn't writing great stories anymore, come back aboard!  I'm telling you, it's worth the ride.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|The movie was okay of course it would have been better if it was more than two hours like the others. Mr. director said the extended cut would be fourteen minutes longer or more but that turned out to be crap. Adding three minutes and removing a few doesn't qualify as extended. The director was not the best choice in making this film. I hope they do a better job with the next one and I mean better because it's suppose to be John McClane's send off.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have the books at home, but I enjoy it more on my kindle.  The three books all wrapped up in one amazing set. So far, I've read the series  six times.  I very much enjoy The Hunger Games series. I enjoy Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and feel like I'm in the arena, the districts, or the Capitol with Katniss. Suzanne Collins had wrote a great series with great detail. The Hunger Games series is a great buy and I would recommend it to anyone who loves action.
B0015AARJI|1.0|This place had a good review and a cheap controller so I thought I would be getting a good deal on a decent controller.  But It is garbage.  I will keep it for playing netflix but that is all I would recommend using this controller for
B00BESM14U|5.0|I didn't know anything about the movie going in, I picked it off the cover.  It was wonderful, funny and touching.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I donated 'The Six Pack' to my local library. The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990 is the best CD box set release of ZZ Top so far. The original master recordings was used NOT the remixers.<br /><br />I can recommend this excellent ZZ Top box set. :)
B00D6M86RS|4.0|The only issue I really have is that paying for the app itself only gets you one board, and you have to purchase any other boards you might be interested in playing.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I love this album. I think it's the best one so far out of all three. I first heard about it of 88.5
1781162646|5.0|What a great story. loved it from beginning to end. Stephen King is just an excellent story teller. However I did learn something about myself. I am spoiled to my Kindle. I absolutely hated not being able to read this book on my Kindle.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Cannot wait for #3 this one is as good as #1.  Having visited Pearl Harbor recently his depiction was incredibly familiar and gut wrenching.
B00D611UMM|5.0|Produced immaculately (by Guy Sigsworth), its electro-sound is current yet honors who Alison Moyet is, especially showcasing her bold, deep, original and extraordinary voice. Alison Moyet & Guy Sigsworth wrote practically all the songs --- their songwriting is masterful!
B0000669JL|4.0|I enjoyed reading about how resourceful the Jamacian culture is and has to be. Had known very little if nothing about Rastifarian<br />religion. I often wondered if his music was coming from those spliffs he continually smoked! I had read somewhere that Marley's cancer started as a melanoma on his toe but was confused if it started with his backyard soccer injury . It seems that early surgery may have saved or lengthened his life so it is unfortunate that his beliefs stopped this intervention.I had none of his music and bought a c.d. and am really enjoying it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love doesn't begin to describe how I feel about this book. I laughed out loud so many times my husband finally told me to stop explaining why I was laughing and just finish it already. You won't be disappointed. I promise!
B008I43DYU|3.0|I like the large size and easy touch and the fact that your entries continue to be visible on the screen until you reach your final calculation.  It makes it easy to verify your accuracy.  However it lacks percentage or square root keys.
B00406O7YK|2.0|I find the continuous dance routines amazing but trite. Also I'm not a big fan of Barbra. To top it off, it froze -- presumably near the end -- and would not start up again. Perhaps that was a problem with Roku, but very unsatisfactory.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The piano guys are genuinely inspiring! The songs are full of personality! The kids even love to listen to them!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Great album worth the wait, excels in a variety of great monodies and rhythms to elevate the mind body and soul.
B003VWU2WA|1.0|support for this mouse goes to win xp and no farther.....so far as I can tell....I use SolidWorksand this would be magic if it worked.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|Plots and characters good but the ending isn't such a sales line for a sequel that it leaves you feeling conned
B008602KQI|5.0|I mainly watched this because my daughter wanted to see it, but ended up loving it. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|I bought this for my Granddaughter to give to her sister for her birthday, which is the 21st of June.  She hasn't seen it yet, but it arrived in good shape and right on time.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book spoke to me and made me aware of feelings I didn't know where there.  It gave me a new perspective on myself, my place in the world as a woman, a business owner and a mentor for others.  I now look at situations at work differently and try to make decisions based on many of the ideas I read in this book.  I want to thank Sheryl for writing this and saying many things that we women have been thinking and feeling.  I bought copies for both my daughters who are college age.  I wish I had this insight years ago.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son and his son both enjoyed playing this game together . Fun times for both of them and lots of laughs.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|One of our book club members recommended this book, and I originally thought it was going to be sad and &#34;draggy.&#34;  I<br />could not put it down once started.  I thought it was beautifully written and cried at the end.  I recommend it highly !!  We meet<br />to discuss the book this this week, so maybe I will add a frew more comments to this review.
B000SEFM6K|3.0|This author has a amazing vocabulary and knows how to use it. But the style of writing  soon lost me and I quit about half way through. A friend was also reading the story at the same time and refused to quit, she said the story got more interesting closer to the end. I might pick it back up at another time but initially was bogged down by the wordiness of the story. I do not like to judge a book until I have let the author complete the story but this one I put aside.
B004ZJZQ92|5.0|This is the best spy movie I have ever watched. Just bought the bluray version to put in my archive...
B00CATSONE|2.0|A very simple book which describes in a limited way the life of Tesla.It is more like a short story.There is much more to tell about Tesla, but this book does not try very hard.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|My 7 year old nephew got a few laughs.  Other than that, this was pretty bad, long and drawn out movie.  I had been hoping they'd do Wicked but now I'm hoping it's spared a shabby screen production.
B00846TRHY|5.0|Awesome story of redemption ...very eye opening to the atrocities of what the people of Sudan suffer. Also enjoy the fact that it is based on the life of someone who actually lived it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a pretty fun game and a good way to kill time. Each dino gives you money after a certain time.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|You can't beat the first season of this show, from the whodunit killer on the loose, to the intro to the large cast of characters. It is really closely based on the first book of the series, but I don't really mind how far it's strayed since. I even like the characters not in the books, like Jessica. I would recommend anyone interested in this series to start with season one. The whole feel of this season is dark, but cozy, even with all the sex and violence.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Like all stories of its kind, it is the people you meet on the journey and the sights of the land that give meaning the person on the trip. What a nice telling
1475143389|5.0|I'll keep this short but this is the book to get to REALLY learn how to workout. It's simple and to the point plus it shows you exactly what needs to be done to get where you want.<br /><br />Great read!!!  Thanks!!!
B002BBJ52U|5.0|It is funny.  It has a number of well-known actors and actresses.  I would recommend it for just a relaxing movie that makes you laugh
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the first e-reader book I have read. It was an easy way to pick a book to read.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|sad sad I was so sad this book lost all its ,love store.it was really boreing  I have no words that can be printed
B005FISBTO|5.0|Absolutely a wonderful and powerful season of Dexter as he explores the idea of religion. Dexter is devoutly nonthiest and a general theme of the season is that faith can be a source of the greatest good or the worst evil, and it is more of a question of application of values. Between the show's great writing and a tad of dark humor, they hit a home run with this concept!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Fun little puzzle game. Some good challenges. Every once in a while it was too easy. I wanted it to be longer.
1451648537|5.0|I was looking for this book, And i hav now pretty awezomeeeeee. I spend few hours reeding that book thank you.
B000V6MT7U|3.0|I listened to Rachmaninoff's own performance, Ashkenazy and Weissenberg. Although Argerich's performance may be considered powerful, it is not what the author intended and it's Argerich's own (excessive) interpretation. Either you like it or you don't, but other than the Rachmaninoff himself, Weissenberg is the best overall performer of Rachmaninoff's piano music (Michelangeli s good too) and, in my opinion, is the best true interpretation (probably better than the author himself)
0316224588|4.0|Another Man's Grave by Ian Rankin<br /><br />Ian Rankin is always compelling and a return to Rebus is always welcome. It did not quite live up to some of Rankin's Rebus books.
B00CMWX150|5.0|Dan Brown - THE LOST SYMBOL, 2009<br /><br />  Like The Da Vinci Code, THE LOST SYMBOL's plot covered in less than a day. Fast-paced, informative and, believe it or not, educational. But above all, it was a true Action / Adventure novel. Dan Brown did a fantastic job of its concoction. He must have done his homework thoroughly. Highly recommended.<br /><br />  A word of caution though: don't get embarrassed by having a dictionary by your side, you may want to refer to it rather frequently.
0823004325|4.0|Artist's Complete Guide to Facial Expression by Gary Faigin<br /><br />This book is an excellent guide for the beginner and the art teacher. The index leaves much to be desired as well as some of the illustrations.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A story woven so intricately and delicately it achieves a profound tangibility that enchants and encompasses. Captivating, exquisite, and unforgettable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is an amazing game. I love the tours . They go to the most amazing places. It's thrilling.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Growing up on superman comic books and being surrounded by the superman mythos i was skeptical going in to see this movie... with that being said...i could'nt have of been more wrong. I thought this iteration on superman was intriguing, interesting and exciting. It told a great story from top to bottom, the acting was superb. The scenes between Johnathen and young clark were among the stand outs and crowe as Jor-El had such a commanding presence even when off screen it was felt. Michael shannon as Zod brought mutliple demensions to the character but it was Antje traue as Faora who was the standout villain in this reboot. Henry Cavill was born to play this iconic role as the next boy in blue, he had it down to smallest nuances of the superman/clark character. The action in here was absolutely mind blowing, intense, and a roller coaster ride of excitement a bit exuasting at times however.Overall it was a solid Man of Steel despite critics and there excessive nitpicking. It is the best superman film in years since Donners 1978 classic and a gold standard for the superhero movie renaissance.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best free game on Kindle. Fun and addictive. The children will be entertained for hours, Their you let them. The only grievance we have is the fact that the dummy's neck breaks if the car flips upside down. Too creepy for a kids game.
B0046UGSNS|4.0|I thought the ending was weak and left too much in the air.  Good performances, though.  Worth the time.  Watch.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I cannot comment on this movie in 2D.  I saw it in 3D and it was absolutely spectacular.  It was gorgeously filmed, and I felt the story was very sweet and beautifully tied to the original classic. It constantly delighted me and, to me, it is a shame that a lot of these reviews are negative because of the way it is formatted for home use.  I personally could care less.  I have a 3D TV, so I have no use for any other format.  Just as sheer entertainment and for the amazing 3D effects to wow and dazzle you,  I give this five stars.  I loved it!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie was somewhat intellectual, but beautifully done!  One of the best parts was the  makeup<br />and the end credits when it portrayed all the various characters that the stars played!
B00847KFDS|5.0|As always, John Fogerty sounds terrific. My husband and I agree that he has a fantastic voice. We love this CD. Singing with others just makes him sound even better. We recommend this to everyone.
0385349947|5.0|This is a great and original book! It is also very well researched and written.  It game the inspiration to negotiate when I got a new job and now I feel more empowered to set high goals for myself and not write off being a leader in the workplace.  I thought I was a feminist inside and out but the book made me realized how much of the negativity toward assertive women I had internalized.  She tells the truth: that sexism is still here, it's just harder to see and that strong and competent women are simply not liked unless they can smile and show themselves to also be nurturing.<br /><br />This is the sad truth and she makes us aware of it.  I will also be using parts of this book in the courses I teach!<br /><br />Thank you Sheryl for speaking the truth that no one wants to hear or acknowledge!
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I read about Jake Bugg in a magazine. Then I looked him up on amazon to see what he sounded like. My husband and I love his voice. He has the talent of sounding a little different on each song and sounding wonderful. He has the best voice that I've heard in a long time. I recommend him to anyone that likes music.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Romeo and Juliet with zombies? Yes please.  While I wouldn't say the writing is up to the same level as the bard (the romeo characters vocabulary is mostly restricted to grunts and moans) this film was sweet, funny, and contained just enough zombie violence to keep me entertained.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good action. Liked the plot and decent for Tom Cruise. Also, can't ever go wrong with Rosamund Pike! I recommend.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Great Series. Love these movies tremendously, and I am glad I was able to purchase the entire collection on bluray.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I read the book, which I'm sure was helpful.  Plus I really liked the story, so I was looking forward to having the visuals to go with my memory of the story.  I was not disappointed, and my wife, who I thought might have trouble following it, actually really enjoyed it and has been asking friends if they have seen it yet.  It is really an excellent and unusual film with beautiful cinematography, great CGI, especially in the future time frames, and a very moving message.  The multiple characters for most actors was an added point of interest, and I thought it made it interesting and supported the underlying point.  See it if you haven't - it's truly great.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Great Series. Love these movies tremendously, and I am glad I was able to purchase the entire collection on bluray.
B00821OX98|5.0|It starts off slow and a little cliche'd with the whole apoctalyptic setting.  The main character does not seem believable as a leader of a resistance but that changes quickly and you get hooked.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Matthew McConaaughey delivered a solid performance with a very good supporting cast.  The dialogue was a bit rushed making it hard to catch the full impact of the dialogue.  It is definitely a movie you see when you just want to escape into moderate action with twists and turns in the story line.  Not appropriate for young preteens..  The storyline is more important than the action that this age group seems to want.  I was able to enjoy watching this movie through prime time streaming.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is a really cool game. It is fast-paced and has very good graphics. Although it does lag a little I am very impressed with it! Five stars!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|For the reader who is willing to go deep and experience the emotional impact of a one of a kind story.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I did not get a virus, but you can just go to youtube on the web...<br />If you get viruses, then your device stinks.. bad.<br />This is a good (not perfect) app.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|I bought this DVD/Blueray combo despite all of the negative reviews on Amazon. In fact, if you WANT 3D BUY THIS COMBO! As soon as you open the packaging and see the discs there are papers with advertisements... don't throw those away, the one with Disney Movie Rewards (and digital copy)on the front of it offers you 3D for $6 more on the inside right panel. Yeah, six dollars more but I'm tired of all the BS and whining on these reviews instead of the movie!!!<br /><br />THE MOVIE ITSELF... Maybe it's different from what you'd think if you'd read the books or totally inaccurate to them, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie. Disney has its own takes on every story you know. As a movie it was beautiful and I loved it. I see this movie as a guy on a quest in a strange and unknown land (neither of us know anything about it), we get to go with him on his adventures and see OZ before the movie we all know and love. If you like this movie I would recommend highly Return to OZ, which is old but good and takes place after the OZ we know.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Good movie for kids. All ages can enjoy the story and enjoy the lesson learned. Goof for the whole family
B004P7CNE0|4.0|I purchased this DVD because I am trying to collect all of Christian Bale's acting performance..It is well done, written and again acted..
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Very touching love story between two people that FINALLY come together after hurdles were put in their way that kept them apart.
B003YL4KS0|3.0|Someone I know recommended this book after I complimented her on her hair, it looked great.  After following the author's recommendations, my hair didn't look any better and is still frizzy, I'm bummed. It didn't work for me.<br /><br />Testimonials took up a lot of space in the book.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This was a good read until the end. I literally turned the last page expecting more and was shocked to realize that was all. Very disappointing because the story had been compelling up until the last chapter. Still a good read.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is my son's all time favorite movie.  It is laced with profanity so if that bothers you, you probably won't want to see it.  This movie takes the scary theme of zombies and makes it funny.  There are so many laugh out loud moments!  I love the actors and their acting abilities in this movie.  They are all perfect for their roles.  My son has either lost or broken/scratched several copies of this movie over the years, and it is so good and he loves watching it so much that I always end up replacing it with a new copy.  We just got this dvd in the mail about a week or so ago, and he's watched it repeatedly already.  Great movie!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I should start out by saying I am an adult and I grew up with the 1939 movie \\"Wizard of Oz.\\"<br /><br />This movie is obviously a prequel and \\"re imagining\\" to the famous \\"Wizard of Oz\\" of 1939. However, while it owes recognition factor to the earlier classic, it is a movie that stands on its own, I thought it was very entertaining and I enjoyed some of the very clever homages in this movie to the 1939 film.<br /><br />However I could not help but think that this movie might not appeal to everyone, especially those who are seeking more rough and tumble, destructive and violent action (i.e. \\"Transformers\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Dark Knight\\", etc.). This is a Disney film, after all, and so it is gentler than some of the competition. It must have been tough for them to manage. They have to give the audience what it wants, yet they have to stay true to their core values. Not an easy balance, but I think this film did manage to do it to some extent substituting spectacular cleverness for violence. It worked for me, and I applaud Disney.<br /><br />Possible Spoiler Alert - I won't give away the plot, but I do have to mention some characters to explain my opinion of the film.<br /><br />The film opens, like the 1939 film, in black and white, and tells the 'back story\\" of the main character, OZ, the guy who is to become the Wizard. It's a clever update of a filming trick used by the earlier film by using not only a change to color when we finally get to OZ, but also an aspect ratio change from square screen to super wide screen.<br /><br />The makers of the film were obviously paying homage to the 1939 movie technique and adapting it to a modern audience. I thought it was clever. For me it worked and I admired it.<br /><br />The images of OZ are in super color, as we would expect, and much of it does look magical enough. It's very floral. Emerald City looks suitably futuristic and the green colors and gold accents sometimes really pop. I enjoyed the throne room with its \\"organ pipes\\" shaped green curtains, an homage again to throne room in the 1939 movie. (At that time, Theater Pipe Organs were very much in vogue).<br /><br />We also have some familiar characters (Glinda, the Wicked Witch, OZ, the Munchkins) but we get some new and unexpected characters who are quite charming.<br />New Characters Add Charm:<br /><br />We very quickly meet Finley, a flying monkey dressed in a bell hop's uniform. This is of course, an homage to the 1939 film's flying monkeys, with a twist. Finley is a good guy and a bit of comic relief. He's a well rendered CGI character, very expressive, that OZ plays well with. OZ does not treat him as well as he could, and although he's supposed to be a type of 'side kick' he's treated more as a 'side kickED' by OZ who takes advantage of his good nature. But then again, OZ is a flawed wizard who must learn to be a good guy instead of a selfish con man.<br /><br />We meet a new character that was not referenced in the 1939 film, but appears in the books, the China Doll. Of course, she's another CGI character, and is also a child. The animation and artwork here are excellent and she is a believable and fragile character. I liked her the best. OZ interacts well with her, and she brings out a sense of tenderness and nurturing in OZ that tells us, he might not be such a scoundrel after all.<br /><br />Glinda is as expected, blonde and magical, but not nearly as syrupy as the actress Billie Burke was in the 1939 film. She seems naive at first, but we soon learn that she's practical, got a brain, and figures out OZ's con job -- something not everyone in Emerald City figures out until it is too late.<br /><br />OZ himself is a likable but flawed man, one who hopes for glory, but falls short of being worthy of it until the end. As expected, he starts out selfish, conniving and arrogant, and by the end redeems himself through application of wit and wisdom, with a bit of admiration for Thomas Edison (who was not the nicest guy in the world either, nor a good role model!)<br /><br />Since this is a prequel, the Tin Man isn't here, but there is a slight homage to the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow of the 1939 film cleverly worked into the plot, there's even a \\"Gale\\" reference worked in.<br /><br />So the film writing has some clever moments, but you've got to pay attention to get them!<br /><br />Action and Pacing:<br /><br />Some of the action is quite good and exciting, there are times when the wicked witches are downright scary. That is aided by a bombastic soundtrack which unfortunately is a bit uneven. When the characters are talking I had to turn up the volume. When a special effect is happening I had to dive for the volume control to turn it down.<br /><br />Overall the special effects (especially the flying bubbles scene) are well done and sometimes thrilling. There is a large cast of characters and the 'grand battle' that is such a staple of current films (i.e. \\"Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Hobbit\\", \\"Transformers\\", etc.), threatens yet another 'us against them' bloodbath of fire and destruction. However, the film makers pull another twist. No one gets hurt, and nothing much gets destroyed, yet there are plenty of fireworks and yelling and crowd scenes. I enjoyed that this movie found an alternative to the popular wave of violent battles.<br /><br />The lesson here is that you can win a war without firing a shot, if you use imagination and ingenuity (and special effects). Not everyone may be satisfied with that, but this is a movie aimed at the family crowd.<br /><br />The pacing, however, is where the film may fall down for some viewers.<br /><br />The back story in Kansas is a bit long for those viewers who want to get to OZ and enjoy its wonders. I am thinking of younger children who are expecting to be awed right away. I can imagine them getting bored and wondering why everything is taking so long to get going.<br /><br />It also turns out that OZ is apparently a womanizer, love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy -- a character flaw that he must overcome (it is an important part of how he gets into trouble with the Wicked Witch). Judging by the final scene with him and Glinda, he doesn't get it, and she should know better.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I found this film very entertaining and a good rendition of OZ before the arrival of Dorothy.<br /><br />The color and scenery are good, there are plenty of fantastic things to look at. The new characters are quite charming, the film stays true to the message of 'good is better than evil' and there is good action, and no real violence.<br /><br />I think however, it is a bit sophisticated for the 'kid' crowd who might want more magic, action, and less thoughtfulness.<br /><br />It is a very fine effort, very enjoyable, but it doesn't have the stuff of a classic either from MGM in 1939 or from Disney.<br /><br />For that, I'd recommend \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".rld either, nor a good role model!)<br /><br />Since this is a prequel, the Tin Man isn't here, but there is a slight homage to the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow of the 1939 film cleverly worked into the plot, there's even a \\"Gale\\" reference worked in.<br /><br />So the film writing has some clever moments, but you've got to pay attention to get them!<br /><br />Action and Pacing:<br /><br />Some of the action is quite good and exciting, there are times when the wicked witches are downright scary.

I can imagine them getting bored and wondering why everything is taking so long to get going.<br /><br />It also turns out that OZ is apparently a womanizer, love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy -- a character flaw that he must overcome (it is an important part of how he gets into trouble with the Wicked Witch). Judging by the final scene with him and Glinda, he doesn't get it, and she should know better.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I found this film very entertaining and a good rendition of OZ before the arrival of Dorothy.<br /><br />The color and scenery are good, there are plenty of fantastic things to look at. The new characters are quite charming, the film stays true to the message of 'good is better than evil' and there is good action, and no real violence.<br /><br />I think however, it is a bit sophisticated for the 'kid' crowd who might want more magic, action, and less thoughtfulness.<br /><br />It is a very fine effort, very enjoyable, but it doesn't have the stuff of a classic either from MGM in 1939 or from Disney.<br /><br />For that, I'd recommend \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".
B00821OX98|5.0|This is the first thing I watched when we registered our television.  Best thing since sliced bread.  I am starting on the second season.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|Each battery last only less than a week and the low battery message will come on. The packaging also appeared old, i.e. these batteries have been sitting in the warehouse for years?  I would not buy them again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series and this season in particular.  It keels getting better and better!  Superb writing and acting make this series a must not miss!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put down this book and immediately got the 2 follow up books to read.I didn't want the story to end!
B004GFN11A|4.0|Easy to use and works well for free product. Wish was a little more flexible, but can not beat features for the price!!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I love platform games, and this one I really enjoy.  So many of the platform games are not much good, but I loved this one.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Great story about a teen who discovers his psychic ability and how it changes his whole world. Great plot and development of the characters. Looking forward to Book 2.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|In a day and age where it is near essential for a show to have components to it which render it \\"non-family\\" watchable to be successful in the mainstream, it is remarkable that a show can be made for PBS (and hence lacking all of the above-mentioned \\"components\\") and still be as good as any other show on TV. Excellent story. Excellent acting. I see why the overall average rating, despite being comprised of THOUSANDS of reviews, is a compete five stars
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|After watching this movie I felt just meh... The action wasnt good and the movie just kept on going on and on and on without any real substance. Its not worth the $4.99 rental maybe the $1.50 from a redbox but thats a big maybe. You need to be out of options before watching this movie
B009KUANWG|5.0|Highest rating: She's Adele.  Would definitely recommend: Innovative, and Adele.  Grateful for her great talent and straightforward zest for life.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really wish I had been able to see this in theaters. It was beyond good, it was incredible. Definitely not the type of movie you see once, say its good and move on. No, this one you'll want to watch over and over...and then over again!
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|This albumn<br /> is Great,Some songs have a Thin Lizzy sound to them,the other tunes just flat out Rock.The wwhole Band kicks Butt,Damon and Scott are Great guitarists,enough said!!!!
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Really enjoyed the last 2 movies of the Twilight Saga.  Better acting, great special effects and the movie did a fabulous job following the books.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book is not that well written but good enough to get the point. The mystery inside North Korea is revealed here and can be hard to take.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Really hoping that they do follow up movies continuing the story.  Well told story, good acting - believable and fantastic special effects.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|You can play with out in app purchases but it is slow.<br /><br />Graphics are good but tasks are repetitive and sometimes hard to obtain.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Disappointed with the way the story line was laid out.  Great actors/actress', good special effects...major lack on the over all story
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I bought this for summer reading, and it was a great choice. Plenty of mystery, thriller, espionage, murder and mayhem. I liked it so much I bought the second one, The Hit which I'm in the middle of right now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a simple concept: &quot;do math, and do it correctly&quot;. That's what this app does. It also helps that it's prettier than the built-in Android version.  I dig it, you should, too!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I have seen different versions, but by far this is the best.  My friend and I never get tired of seeing it and singing the songs.  This movie has action, color, vitality, romance and love for humankind.  Andrew Webber has been gifted and in return shares that inspiration with us.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I was able to set-up reoccurring events easily. Wish I was able to edit these as inevitably they get rescheduled one week or even cancelled. I like the ability to change color... I assigned a color to each family member. I have not tried to upload to our computer (or anywhere else for that matter). I hope to be able to do this so my husband and I can add events easily and keep each other informed of appts, etc.
B007712XAU|4.0|Excellent series that makes you want to find out what happens next. My only complaint is the ever suffering butler feels a bit too much, too long-suffering.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|It's something for a family to gather around and have a nice afternoon together. Reminded me of when things were simple and adventures were the fun.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I had my thought that it would not work, but you all proved me wrong. It works ahead the kindle run out of life.
B005LJITS0|4.0|Ended too soon for me. I wish it would become a foundation for an Avenger character. True to Book fashion
B000UR9T82|5.0|Spiderman, A boy, A troubled life, A hero. Lots of action, Lots of Drama. A friendship and a girlfriend. All the aspects of a great movie. Don't forget a Villain. A ++++++ Loved it.
1616614609|4.0|Started to play after getting tired of Magic the Gathering. The mechanics are deep and very complex. It took me and my brother about 3 hours to go through and learn all the rules and about 5 games before we felt comfortable with what we were doing to began branching out our strategies. We were both were very fluent with Magic and there are similar concepts that helped us learn Netrunner but be prepared to learn lots of new terminology. If you and a buddy are willing to invest the time you will find its really fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|easy but fun. the game makes you think but its not unbearably hard. a good relaxed thinking game that uses your common sense.
B001NLL93W|5.0|So far this is my favorite of the series. She is an amazing author! Characters grew a lot in this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my two and four year olds love playing these games. they can easily understand most of them. at the same time there is enough challange to keep the adults wanting to play too.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Ending kind of feels rough because its all wrapped up too fast. Other than that the story line was great.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this for a professional women's book club and couldn't put it down. Tina Fey carries her witty take on life's hurdles (everything from getting older, balancing work and home life to childrearing).
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is no district 12.<br />I can't wait to read the next book in the series.<br />Suzanne Collins is a truly blessed writer.
B007RJTHXS|4.0|The movie is great, amazing actors, if you are into the older movies I know I am, this movie is the one for you! But I have to say the quality isn't that good, it doesn't come in clear at all.
1781162646|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Reminded me of \\"Shawshank \\"Redemption\\", and \\" The Body\\" Read it in 3 1/2 hours and it felt like 10 minutes HATED to see it end!
B0055S348W|1.0|I should be giving the one star to Amazon. Never given an opportunity to download the software. Impossible to locate useful help. Just a wasted $12.99. Maybe someday I'll find a free app. Using this app is a gamble. You might get to download it and you might not.<br /><br />Follow-up: I was finally given an opportunity to download and install this software several days after purchase. It loaded and works well. I don't know why it tools days to process my purchase. If you need something fast then look elsewhere. This does work well when you finally he  it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app allows you to combine different games into one, such as, hidden objects and mystery games while completing tasks to earn a higher name as you reach for the mastery level. I really enjoy this game as I hope y also do!!! :)<br />Have a wonderful experience playing Mystery Manor.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I  enjoy being able to print directly from my Kindle to my printer. I would  highly recommend this app to my friends.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|At first the selection books seem like a cute bachelor style love story, but it quickly becomes obvious that the story is much deeper as the well rounded love story plays out against a background of deep socioeconomic commentaries about what our country could become if we get lazy, or let unscrupulous leaders charm and buy their way into power. America is truly an embodiment of the nation she is named after- strong, courageous, just and a bit impulsive. I can't wait to read the final book!
B00000DI06|5.0|Rutter's Requiem is everything I could have hoped it might be! It is moving, wonderfully so, a CD I listen to over and over. The jarring dissonances of some requiems (such as Anthony Lloyd Webber's) are not to be found in this one. And the Magnificat is set to a joyful beat that I would not have expected but which fits the occasion! I thoroughly recommend this one!

B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I looked at the seemingly solid reviews and thought what the hay boy was I wrong this movie is a b-rate attempt at best
B00000JNO2|5.0|Fantastic album! One skynyrds best. I've had this album before, dating all the way back to 8-track. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed it !
B008K9SG9K|5.0|A great album by Imagine Dragons for all fans of alternative music.  Definitely check it out.  Favorites include Top of the World.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I travel quite a bit - this lets me listen to stations from places I'm visiting and bring them home.  Very easy to use, includes links to music sources for many stations, and keeps track of programs.
B005HP2J66|4.0|Photography is great, coverage of paintings is complete, but there is no help with understanding intent of the art. There is no evidence to relate the paintings to &#34;dreams&#34;.
0307719219|5.0|The authors offer a simple but powerful theory to explain why nations fail. Institutions and institutional changes are the root causes of the origins of prosperity and poverty in societies, past and present and indeed future. They identify inclusive and extractive political and economic systems and describe how they create prosperity and poverty around the world, supporting their arguments with solid historical and present day evidence. In essence, prosperity and poverty among societies are not predetermined but a matter of institutional choices by the ruling elites at critical junctures. In this way, the authors establish the primacy of politics in the issue of development.<br /><br />  I am particularly impressed by their discussion on the current growth in China. With a lot of intellectual courage, confidence and honesty, the authors believe that 'Chinese growth, as it has unfolded so far, is just another form of growth under extractive political institutions, unlikely translated into sustained economic development.' 'Such growth was feasible because there was a lot of catching up to be done.' Amid the current over-selling of the China model, such statements are distressing and disappointing to some autocrats seeking growth under authoritarianism.

B000YMMN04|5.0|It had many nuances of just what is going on in the world today.  This movie would be a great study on race and just what is sin and how it affects our lives.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This is an exceptional book. Humour abounds at every turn of the page.<br />As one gets into the book one wonders what else, and whoelse, uor hero will get up to, and who he has met during his long and exceptional life.<br />This book should not be missed.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I chose this rating, because I appreciated the fact that the author took the time to explain the parts that would leave questions that would ruin everything.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Having been a King fan forever, gotta say this story totally rocks. Kept me entranced to the very last word.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Not bad for a couple of hours of entertainment.  Let's face it. There won't be another 'Wizard of Oz' movie. It was a movie for it's time, and although this movie pretty much stays true to the story (I never read Frank's books), it isn't the same form of movie.  There are no catchy jingles, no singing by the characters at all.  Just a lot of CGI, and pretty colors.  Even the wicked witch couldn't pull of an evil laugh.  Oh well, I guess that takes practice.  The only thing that really irked me about the movie - was the phrase 'You all suck' by Oz at the beginning. This is a much more modern term and would not have been voiced in that manner, even by a circus performer.<br /><br />Most of the movie was predictable, some of the war 'tactics' were entertaining. But in the end, I liked watching it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like how with some of the really hard levels I can see the pattern immediately, but others I need to work on for an hour before I can see it. The balance between them is nice, upping morale so that I'm more willing to work on the more difficult levels as much as I need to do so.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Cool stuff:<br />- Auto-detects borders of the document from pictures you take<br />- You can manually set the borders for each scan<br />- Auto-enhance actually works, almost like magic, haven't had to tweak the settings for any of the photos or documents I've scanned so far<br />- Share directly via e-mail, cloud storage, etc.<br /><br />...But it freezes quite frequently on my Galaxy S3. I'm satisfied because I got it free, but I would be kinda pissy if I paid for this.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was a much anticipated book and I couldn't wait to download it when it came available.  Glad to see the saga of Gideon and Eva continued and their relationship progresses.  However, the ending was very abrupt!!!  Luckily, Sylvia Day let us all know the story was going to continue into another book!  Otherwise, I'd have really been angry!!!  Would have rated higher if the ending was better.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry birds is a execellent game its so good i would trade gold for the game angry birds its so good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Since I can't have my own horse, this was really fun and really cool. Parents and kids had fun playing together.
1400069289|2.0|The basic premise of this book is good, that bad habits can be broken through realizing they are the result of: 1) cues , and 2) rewards.  That said, the author spends much of the book attempting to enlighten us with silly examples of habit busters such as: 1) Tony Dungy and the Tampa Bay Bucs;  2) Tony Dungy and the Indianapolis Colts; and, 3) the gay rights movement. Probably at least half of the book is alliterated with Dungy and Gay Rights examples.  Less, this, it may have been a good read.
B005HED08I|5.0|Whatever happened to sci-fi plot and character development? It's all here in brilliantly restored version of the original TV series.
1452651930|5.0|Hawke and Sienna were destined from the first book in the series 'Slave to Sensation'.  Lara and Walkers relationship was an added bonus to the series.  It demonstrates how well the author has plotted the relationships of alll the characters from beginning to this book in the series. Keep the books coming.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|Suggest Julianne Hough go back to singing and dancing -- the acting just wasn't credible. Josh Dushanel did a better job and would like to see him in another movie
078322933X|2.0|I liked this when it first came out and so I bought it here on Amazon to watch it again and add it to my dvd library but when we watched it again I realized that even tho I love Mark Wahlberg I did not like this movie at all. In all defense, I have grown up a lot and don't like the sex in it - underage sex that is. I sold it.
B003F9G8B8|4.0|Morgan Freeman is always compelling and matt Damon pulls off a south African accent believably.  Mandela and his rare wisdom make for a great topic on film and the movie will stay with you.  You don't have to care for rugby to enjoy the film - it's about politics and social change ultimately.
1594202842|5.0|I was a young mother at 19 yrs old and was always strict with my son yet balanced it with a lot of love. He was always a great kid and didn't get into one ounce of trouble all through his young years all the way through high school so this was a very interesting book for me to read. He is now engaged to a Thai gal that is extremely bright and is a straight A student..so is her sister. In Asia, they are much more strict with their children in discipline and their studies than we are here in America. With a good balance I believe one can raise their child into a great adult. That is what parenting is all about- it's about raising a good smart productive adult and not letting your kids run the household and making all the decisions. When you let your child do what they want and there is no structure they don't respect you as they grow older and always expect you to do everything for them and not making it on their own.  I loved this book, it made me laugh and made me cry!
B0012GMW34|4.0|A nice album by two talented guitar players, nice jazz pieces. A bit mellower than John McLaughlin's worked up jazz, and something a bit different from Carlos Santana.

B003EV6DBW|4.0|Pros: This content of this set is excellent! The packaging of this set is excellent. Those familiar with recent sets like the Complete David Tenant DVD set atrocious packaging will be pleased that the packaging here is individual open trays for easy insertion and removal of the disks without damage.<br /><br />Cons: There's something odd about the mastering of these disks. Not sure if this is some kind of copy protection scheme or what but these disks seem to have some unusual non-standard mastering which caused me problems playing back these disks on some pc-based software players and trans-coding the content to a smaller portable format (fair-use).<br /><br />Bottom Line: This set is RECOMMENDED unless you have intention to convert the content to another format in which case the DVD set may work better. One star lost for odd disk mastering.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have not used eBay for a few years. I thought I would try to get a BBQ from them and I got the app to follow the bidding. This app is great supper easy to use.
0140120416|5.0|Excellent and instructive, didactic, I appreciate the presence of answers to exercises, dialogs and a good introduction to grammar.<br />Great addition to anyone self techinf or even attending Russian classes. Even though, the book should warn that there are more exceptions to rules than rules.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I was very cautious about movies messing with the classic wizard of oz...this movie is great...they didn't try to redo the original and a lot of the emerald city looks how I remember it in the original....they did a great job on making it all look the same
B007EECSFA|5.0|I could not put the book down.  At times I was confused about what was happening in the book, but that made my interest grow stronger.
B00C7DGRL4|1.0|I don't know how this movie got good reviews. It's a terrible movie, if you're thinking about buying it you might wanna check the reviews on another site because these people are crazy. I rented the movie but what a waste of time and money. So glad I didn't buy this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am not going to go on and on , you have plenty of other bad reviews about this book. I  always felt if I didn't have something nice to say, I wouldn't. But, in this case I must state the obvious. First,  I waited forever for this book, why, I was hoping for a GREAT ending to a great story. Well, big surprise, not the end.  Also, to much filler, to many other characters.  No reason to leave us hanging except more money for the author and publisher.  I could go on , and some of the reviews do. So I WILL END IT with saying that I won't be keeping my eyes open for book four of five!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing this game but it takes too long for the energy to be restored. Faster restore time would be awesome. You can play only a few levels before you're depleted.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's a fun game and a little challeging to get 3 stars..  I've played other Mahjong games but this is the best one so far!.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It is not as well written as his first two books. There was too much jumping from one person to another, with not enough explanation of one's circumstances and too much of anothers.  There was Implausible and contrived coming together --he just attempted to put too much in one book.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|great show ,bought this as a deal of the day at a price i couldn't let slip by . glad i snached it up
B00CFQMVLS|4.0|Bruce Willis, doing his usual smart mouth quips, which I happen to like.  Enjoyable ! He is making getting older, more fun than it really is LOL
B008KRJWEK|1.0|worst game ive ever played do not get it it takes so long to load and its cheesy trust me.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I liked it beginning was kind of slow but it got better as it went along. Worth the price of 3.99.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was an unusual take on your standard zombie infestation novel.  It had a start, middle and end.  I think that a lot of novels leave you feeling helpless on the subject, but I thought that the way they wrapped it at the end was very satisfying.  I wouldn't refer to it as a happy ending, but more of a hopeful one.  It took me a bit to realize that certain narrators were looped in on more than one occasion, while others were only used once.  It was interesting to see how certain narrative lines linked in with one another.  NOT looking forward to the movie at all, I think that they really did not follow the concept of the book closely enough.  I really can't figure out what the trailers have in common with the novel other than zombies!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Good movie well worth the 4.99 price tag. Get story line without the abundance of actors. Well done Mr Lee.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|The more I listen the more I love it.!!! I saw him in person and half his concert was from this new CD. Georgia on My Mind is done so well but I like his originals like &#34;Gone Baby Gone&#34;
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|The movie would have been better if the stayed with one era longer than a couple of minutes before goin to another.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|it has amazing graphics. fun taking care of the animals and fun to battle also they have the cutest animals in the whole paper world
159463176X|3.0|I have been an avid fan of both of Mr. Hosseini's first two novels and have been anxiously awaiting the release of this book. Unfortunately for me it was a great disappointment. The book starts out great and immediately pulls you in and holds your attention. But it slowly begins to drag and the characters become uninteresting. In many ways it is sad but surely at no time (after the beginning) did I feel that it was hard to put down. No drama. No intensity. I'm sure he could do so much better!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I believe this game is an amazing experience. I how ever feel It would be better if it was easier to get new suits. I also like the ability to get the purchase in game money type for free in daily missions.
B005HSL626|2.0|I was very surprised that my Lenovo apps management insists this is a pirated product.  Might want to look at that again Amazon.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I can't begin to express how much I enjoyed this trilogy. The ending is unbelievable, scary, and riveting. Better than you can imagine. The epilogue ties it up and makes you happy you stuck to reading it through.  Enjoy
B00CWY76CC|5.0|excellent game makes you think.  good while waiting for the train. will gladly play more when new puzzles are available. thanks
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The addiction to this show started here. Best show on television. Better than Walking Dead,Breaking Bad, and Mad Men, And 9 is the best Doctor.
B00BHMF578|5.0|A little 'Hollywood-esk' to build suspense... but a good movie overall.  Entertaining and goes a little into the history of the time.
0345349571|5.0|Too good to check out from the library -- this belongs in your permanent collection.  The best contemporary book on Medieval and early Renaissance history in print.  Tuchman's excellent writing is thought-provoking, well researched, and will leave you wondrously grateful to be living in the 21st century.  Be sure and print your name on the inside cover since you're going to find yourself loaning this out to your intellectually-curious friends. I just bought my third copy.  Maybe I should get better friends.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|This album is one i’ve been wanting for a while - finally went for it when i realized EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM is one I FAVORITE!
B000I8ERVC|3.0|The story line seems ridiculous looking back at that era and remembering how 'it really was.'<br /><br />But, to me, the scenes riding the motorcycles across the South were outstanding.
1401929281|5.0|My first THETA experience was so AMAZING! I know this modality works ~ on so many levels! Reading about it is challenging, but what worth learning isn’t?

B0068CARXY|5.0|Her voice is amazing, so emotive and complex. My boyfriend uses her music to send me messages… HAWT!! So Good.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I love Nicholas  Sparks.  I enjoyed the character development and the lead in story.  The supernatural stuff was so-so.  But I hated the ending.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading it.  Very unfulfilling and depressing ending.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Her voice is amazing, so emotive and complex.  Seriously, this album is definitely one of my favs. Keep Your Ears OPEN!
B000FC1KGG|5.0|Took me away from all my problems and isn't that what we really want from a story.  I didn't stop until I had read the whole thing.  Highly recommend this story.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the update 0.7.1 and it is awesome,please come up with more minecraft pocket edition updates.I would really love it and so would my little brother he loves minecraft pocket edition too.
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|I did not like the quality of the picture and it appeared that parts of the movie was missing. The characters roles were not developed enough. The movie should have been free.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I luv this game so much because it is just fun to play and it IS worth downloading so I hope I helped u if not sorry ;(
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|This is one of the best Star Trek movies.<br />It is a sequel to Wrath of Khan and Search for Spock.<br /><br />I saw it when it first came out and I just bought the DVD for my 11 year old  granddaughter who has grown beyond the animated series. We will watch it together.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This was a great movie....and was totally a new taken on a favorite-took me back to my childhood without being too cheesy
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|The FBI estimates at any given time that there are 500 mass murders lose in the country. This is an gradation of one such psychopath. They have made movie of the third book in this series.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|Can never get sick of these guys :) they are as funny now as in the original...would recommend to any ice age fan
B008602KQI|3.0|A science fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously or have a million warriors running all over place. It is a believable movie concept; something that a dictator led country would institute for the amusement of the folks.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Although the third is the best in the series a Feast for Crows is still a good book. Even though most of the more interesting characters are in the next book this b one was necessary, although it could have been done in less than 700 pages. The book gets much more interesting  at the end when everything unfolds. Although this book sometimes seems like a chore to read the unfolding events are worth it. Although this is my least favorite book of the series Martin still wrote it well and its a must read for all fans.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore. Love the costumes, setting and story line. I'm hooked... Can't wait for the next season.
B00C7EGV5U|5.0|There are a handful of books that I have read over the last fifty years or so that I will never forget. Things Fall Apart is one of them. The language, the imagery, the story-line, the characters are drawn or rather painted with such deceptively simple but powerful brush strokes that they have become permanently etched in my consciousness. This book is truly a literary masterpiece.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was really looking forward to this novel because the other two were so moving they really stuck with me this one not so much I just didn't care as much about the characters
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Initially I was afraid that this movie might be yet another flop (like Alice), but upon viewing it I can say that it held decently. Taking into an account that this movie is for kids, the characters were OK. There is a bridge, actors emulating to a certain level the old Wizard of Oz without becoming overly cheesy. Some dialogues and relationships should have been developed more, as it feels a bit naive and rushed, some a bit questionable - dancing next to the fire, and then what exactly follows and is left to our imagination(?) Again it is for kids I guess...<br /><br />It is interesting to observe from a historical stand point how the supporting cast is more ethnically diverse in comparison to the original. Speaking of history I found that line about Thomas Edison being the greatest man, a bit funny - looking back from this time distance, and knowing how Edison swindled several greater scientists than himself for his own profit ( Nikola Tesla comes to mind) I found it very ironic as the praise comes from a \\"magician\\" who is to take the turn for better.<br /><br />Apart from this little irk of mine, the movie was enjoyable, for those who did not read the book(s) it creates a more solid backdrop and explanation about the characters and the world of Oz, and naturally preps for Dorothy to take center stage. Thankfully there was no musical number (Willy Wonka remake anyone?!)<br /><br />Over all 3 stars for the effort.
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I was recommended this book by my professor during my M.S. program, it helped me with on a higher level in the projects I Ann in.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I love this story because is about family, gardens and love. The father is always away because they don't accept the dead of his wife. His son is sick but is realy spiritual sick because he missed his mother and the company of his father and them received the visit of a little girl that changed everything when finded a secret garden.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game. plenty of brain power needed.<br />if you like 100 floors you will love this. and it's free too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT GAME! I recommend this to any minecraft fan or anyone who things it's a interesting game. But can you make the cake recipe retain the buckets after use? THANKS FOR THE GAME!
B00C0XX4YY|4.0|This is a unique and wonderful album. Tame Impala's second album, Lonersim, is somewhat stronger, but both are worth checking out.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great game, many options. Like the ability to shuffle if out of moves. Look forward to the next version to come out.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was the first of the four books in the Pride Series by Jill Sanders and I will say that it was a great start. The author did such a good job detailing the small town people and community and her character development was superb. I look forward to reading the next books in the series, I know I won't be disappointed.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|my husband loved the music in this film. many different music styles and artists - very nice. like it very much
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|beautiful movie awesome loved it  didnt llike the ending to well was sad hope theres a second movie gotta be a second movie
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a great read. I commend Andy Weir on keeping the scenarios about Mark Watney surviving the unexplored terrains of Mars interesting.  I enjoyed reading this book very much.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|I wanted to play as ghost pac man so I unlocked it.All I had top do was top win fist place in a race.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter season 7 was everything I knew it would be and better!! looking forward to season 8! and what that brings!!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is for you. Strong performances, quirky characters, and those lovely Brit accents. What's not to love?
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|PG 13 for a reason. Violence. If you can get past/stomach that, you just might love this movie. My granddaughter has watched it a few times........:-)
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|This is a Great book with real characters and an interesting story that will keep you guessing until the end.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I really like Pam's spirit, you can't help but feel elated while reading this book.  What a great perspective to have in life...<br />Even if the universe doesn't  deliver as soon as promised, her light-hearted look on life is truly contagious.  I have recommended this book to many.
B000TDDIC0|5.0|David Bowie is a unique artist. While most fans will remember Ziggy Stardust and Lets Dance as two very popular albums, I believe Station to Station is where his unique sound and vision are on display. Powerful and intriguing. Wild is the Wind is an earth-shaker!
B00CBT04LI|4.0|I avoided this for awhile after reading so many negative comments. Finally picked it up when the price dropped. DAMN! This movie isn't BAD. No, it didn't break a lot of new ground, but I thought it fit rather nicely into the Carpenter version. I liked the female protagonist. I liked the effects. And the blu-ray looks great. Thumbs up!
B00499QUK2|4.0|This is a great show. It stays true to the original concepts of Sherlock Holmes and Watson. I look forward to seeing more episodes.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes.  I love mysteries and since this is the father of the modern mystery, I love this incarnation of the most famous detective in all of literature!  Cumberbatch is able to capture that relentlessness that Holmes was known for and Freeman's Watson is perfect.  The updating doesn't detract from the essential characteristics of the main characters, which was my initial fear.  Instead, they give Holmes and Watson a whole new set of tools to use and make it better.  Love it!  Cannot wait for Season Three to air on PBS!!!
1781162646|5.0|When I recommend Stephen King to my friends, I always make sure to mention that his work comes in many flavors, from the purely scary to the wildly fantastic to the deeply heartfelt. 'Joyland' is that rare mix of story that brings them all into play.<br /><br />King's strength, as always, is in the characters he breathes life into in these pages. From heartbroken Devin Jones, working through his college summer at the Joyland amusement park and trying to get over a girl who left him behind, learning the carny talk and how to dance like a dog in a giant fur suit, to Erin and Tom who become his fast friends. From Annie and Mike, who he meets on the beach, to all the veteran carnies he meets along the way. King's natural ability to make characters speak like people you've just met on the street, to make them live and breathe on the page, is what propels 'Joyland' forward as the story spins out.<br /><br />And the story is nothing to sneeze at either - a portrait of an independent amusement park in the heat of a 1973 summer, a long-ago murder, a ghost story, a young man with a shadow over his future, a little boy who needs just one chance to fly, and a heart in need of healing. All told with a natural flow and just a hint of nostalgia, the  recollections of someone who lived this time, this place, these events - and numbers them among his treasured days.<br /><br />To put it simply, 'Joyland' is King firing on all cylinders, bringing his considerable talent to bear to craft the tale of a young man's coming of age in a place meant for the child in all of us, in a time past but not forgotten.<br /><br />Just as some days are treasure, some stories are too. This is one of them.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book. While I have read the previous books this one really did not have much of a story to it. I was not kept intrigued as in earlier books.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Story is good, but jumping back and forth between many years does not sit well with me. But all in all, good to read and know about other countries.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|The second in the cycle which includes Craig, this movie does the job of both entertaining and yet offering just that little bit &#34;more&#34; to Bond.  The of-the-moment story has just enough believeable elements to engage the brain; the action is all Bond without being too over-the-top.  Gotta love the strong female characters!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Pathetic animation, terrible acting. Some of the ideas were good and the ending was good. It lends itself to the idea of &#34;pre-wizard&#34; Oz. Not recommended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Finally here for kindle fire! Way better than the first, only one thing what about the other people?!? They be gone! Still great app better graphics, more options, awesome!
B00BF11STU|4.0|Not full of action but definitely worth the watch. Hard to keep track of the names. It held your interest because we all know the ending.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think iron man 3 is the best game I ever played you just have to try it asap you will be addicted right away
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not as much action as we expected but it was still a good movie. Typical but we like that. Jack is a lovable egotistical character.
1593083653|5.0|I like the sarcastic tone. It has memorable people. Covers most of the foibles and sins of mankind. Better than Dickens and Austin.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Just a quick fix on a day with out a calculator and it worked out ok. Works great for quick fix.
0061743526|5.0|Thank you for a beautiful copy of this timeless classic novel. Such a blessing to find at a good price and free shipping!
B009IQG5LK|2.0|I guess if I was an original fan of the Dick Tracy comics, I would have loved this film. Instead, the film came across as really bizarre. I got half-way through it and stopped it for a minute to take care of something. Unfortunately, this disk version does not save the last viewed position like many much cheaper Blu-Rays and DVDs. It's a simple matter of the right Java implementation; but I guess the developers figured if someone stops this film while viewing it must be because they just can't take it any more. It really wasn't worth the effort to access the Scene Selection menu and then search for my last position. I did notice that they were kind and ready enough to attempt to show me the previews once again. I declined.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great characters.  Interesting world.  Can't wait for next chapter!  Anthony Ryan has hit a homerun with this.  Enjoyed it as more than any book I've read this year (which is more than a few).
B002S45V32|5.0|This movie and its' soundtrack changed my life back in the day.  Duckie, was just like me and my friends, salvation army punks.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is awesome but addictive. I have had some problems with freezing during game play but still worth getting. Get free bingo credits daily and buy extra in game if you want. A very fun game.
B004FHP9KA|3.0|I guess I bought into the marketing hype. But I was vaguely disappointed. I didn't DIS-like it...it's enertaining. I just expected more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this new exciting Thinking game. It wants you to get to a new room each level but you must find the keys and the codes.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great story and acting. Jennifer Lawrence continues to amaze me. She is stunning and beautiful. As great as The Hunger games.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun game and  easy to play,. always win this one. Has different versions to play.A fun game
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|stupid game don't get it I hate it so much that you will agree with me very very much thankyou
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This is a surprisingly charming movie. It is quirky and unique. I really think it will become a favorite. For PG-13 it is fine a few yucky moments,after all it is a zombie movie, and a handful of curse words, but nothing to shriek at. For a person who loves morbid humor and usually hates romantic comedies this is the perfect mix of both.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I really loved this version. My mom used to watch the original series & I somewhat know the version. I wasn't really expecting it to be funny at all so when I laughed as Johnny Dep woke up the drunk I realized it was worth watching. What was refreshing is that there wasn't any nude body parts showing & the 2 sex scenes were amusing. The first time I saw \\"True Blood\\" I was actually shocked by what was shown. Yes, I'm 53 & not a prude at all. I just think some shows can go a bit overboard. HBO was not like it is today, yet even regular TV shows more than what I'm use to. I agree, times changed but perhaps the simpler times can be more refreshing too. Leave something to the viewer's imagination. I like the Underworld series & the scenes where Sonia is with Lucien & Selene is with Michael are lovely. They are making love which is how is should be.<br /><br />This Dark Shadows, as I stated above was great! It had some sex not being graphic, no graphic violence & comedy. There is so much horror going on in the real world I prefer to laugh when I'm relaxing. Do like horror flicks as long as they aren't too graphic. Two movies I cannot watch \\"Chainsaw Massacre\\" & \\"30 days of Night\\". I saw parts of \\"30 days of night\\" & know the end but cannot sit down & watch from beginning to end. Must admit some graphic scenes but there is still suspense.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Christina McKenna  has written a good story with a happy ending. She made me laugh and feel extreme anger and sadness at the treatment of one of the characters as a child. It's a good reminder to always be kind to you fellow man because you don't know what they're going through that day. A simple smile may be all it takes to make a person's week.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Different from all of Daft Punk, a lot more electronic with a tendency to the 70's either way it is great music.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|IF YOU LIKE JOE BONNAMASSA YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE. IT'S A JAM SESSION . IT REMINDS ME OF THE OLD DAYS WHEN THE GUYS GOT TOGETHER AND LAID DOWN SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF. IN THIS CASE THE GUYS ARE WELL REGARDED MUSICIANS. THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING CD. BUY IT.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Daughter loves how quickly she can make more baby dragons! She can personalize them and put them in many different scenes.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Like I said before I really like Cassandra Clare's story telling.  Her stories of the Mortal Instruments is great.  I hope she keep writing about them.
0307236722|5.0|Again my wife enjoys the book very much and likes to cook all the recipes so I have the benefit of eating all the tasty baked goods.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|These books are great, I really enjoyed reading them and probably will again.  The story line just keeps going for more.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like it because it is is free and it is just ads if you are do not like ad get the 2$ one
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Story line was good.  This was an enjoyable, relaxing read.  If you like the TV show &#34;Bones&#34; you should read this book
B009K0P10K|5.0|It's the only way I can live the fantasy of looking perfect, living rich and being a total bitch at the same time.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a wonderful, emotional story that is beautifully told.  There is so very much more to this story that the movie reveals.  If you loved the movie, you will love the book even more.  For me it was a very spiritual story.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|It seems different from their other albums.  I'm not a big Fall out Boy fan but I enjoyed this album. It is fun and has good beats. If you haven't ever been into Fall out Boy before, I'd give it a try.
B003CI90MQ|4.0|This is a really good book. It teaches you a lot of the basics and advanced settings on your<br />camera. I like how the author structured it as if he and the reader were out shooting together.<br />Good explanations on why and how for the settings he tells you to use on your camera.
B005DESVPO|5.0|This man is great! I'm gonna snatch up his other CD too Black and Blu. Put it on and listen all the way through. Go out and get it if you love good guitar, smooth vocals, and just plain great music.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|It's not great--It's not bad.  I enjoyed the interaction between mother and son!  Dialogue seemed a bit force at times!
B001VGFMBY|5.0|I love everything Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears puts out.  There's an effortless cool and a great sound about them.  I can't explain it, you just have to give it a listen.
B00902UH5M|5.0|I knew Arnold from movies, and it was really interesting to know more about him as a sportsman, a businessman, and politician. Seeing how much has he done really shows that possibilities are endless for anyone.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|I have been using a GTX460, and decided to upgrade. The choice boiled down to this, or the &#34;ti&#34; model of it. Not being a gamer, this was the choice because of price. For whatever reason, the text display of this card seems a little sharper than the 460 was. The fans are quiet, and there has not been a single problem with it, the driver, or the utilities.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Very interesting to look at they're lives.It is worth seeing.If your an Eagles fan then I would suggest this purchase.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|this is a great looking disc, but it has nothing to do with being &#34;mastered in 4K&#34; its simply because when they did the transfer this time around, they didn't cook the contrast which blew out the highlights and made the film grain look noisy on the first release. This is what it should have been like the first time around but someone decided to &#34;tweak&#34; it, what really confuses me is the fact that the director said he saw the first bluray release in a theater and it looked great, that whole last scene with Gozer had some of the worst highlight clipping I have seen, if you don't own this movie yet, avoid the first release and go for this on instead, download the extras, you shouldn't have to buy these things twice.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I started reading this because it's the second most popular book in the western hemisphere and more I know why. It's a classic for a reason! Nothing short of amazing. After reading the book I watched the old black and white movie and was seriously disappointed, the book was soooo much better. I guess a movie can't recreate the book.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|did not work on my phone, the app would never install. had a very difficult time removing the app after it froze my phone.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It's a very fun interesting and challenging game for the entire family.<br /><br />It's very easy to cope and follow. Wonderful game to spend your free time on.
B000002KKC|4.0|I like FM  especially the title song; I wish I could have just purchased that!!<br /><br /> Thank you for your help
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|If you are a lover of The Wizard of Oz, you will not like this. The costuming and cinematography were great but the story was not up to what I feel Disney could have done. I was disappointed after waiting so long for it to come out for purchase.
0385523912|4.0|May they stay where they are and remain far from us!!  'JOB 38:11'<br /><br />  The book gives the reader a degree of insight never before seen
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I am a big fan of The Original Series, so I came to this a little skeptical and honestly worried that this was going to be The Phantom Menace 2.0, a tacky rehash ruining much of the charm of the original. While this movie lacked the deep and thought provoking content that made TOS so engaging, all of the core characters were (more or less) the same. Obviously different actors were interpreting them, but there was never a situation where I found myself thinking \\"Character X would never do/say THAT!\\"<br /><br />So, in short, I came hoping for a not awful popcorn movie, and was pleasantly surprised by a modern presentation of the original Star Trek characters.
B0087X728K|5.0|Very good price and super fast shipping from Amazon.com.  I used this product on multiple builds, and each time it worked great and was easy to apply.
B002CPMB9O|3.0|Probably was just the story line but I have seen Denzel Russell do much better work.  I was disappointed that the movie didn't move along well.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A wonderfully in-depth and insightful exploration of Abraham Lincoln during the war years, the members of his cabinet, and his personal life!
B003YUBXVI|5.0|The first book in the Alex Rider series is an absolutely phenomenal read. It is action packed, and is very well written. Horowitz has truly created a masterpiece. I read the first page and was hooked. I am about to buy the next book in the series.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Love the characters and playing back on old jokes.  Can't get enough of Barney!  I Look forward to Season 9!
B0091REZMW|4.0|love the different rooms and different modes.  this is my second time coming back to Mystery Manor.<br />will be seeing how far I get this time.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I've been looking for this set at a reasonable price and this fit the bill. Perfect product and looks great on my HD screen!!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|So good! Exciting throughout, even when building the storyline in. Cast was excellent - acting well. Superb graphics and costumes.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The kids seemed to really enjoy it  they got into it. But they agree that it was a little too long
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|thought it would be more funny than it was - kind of a let down. I was expecting more from the same team that made Knocked Up
B005BGBPBG|2.0|I kept hoping the whole movie that she would fall in love with Ethan...Dex was a douchebag, just like Ethan said...VERY DISAPPOINTING...
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Great &#34;fresh&#34; storyline combined with the classic flim, Wizzard of Oz. Great cast, Fantastical graphics! So good to watch a movie with my teen sans sex and gore.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very medtational... yet exciting! My 6-yr-old loves  this game too. You would never know it, but it takes a lot of skill. Nothing violent , or X-rated, I'd definitely give this app FIVE STARS!
B0076NKNLA|1.0|Ugh! I rarely turn a movie off but I did with Marilyn. Talk about a movie dragging - yawn. Leave this one on the shelf.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This movie was a silly \\"high-tech\\" medieval fable, but it has absolutely no respect for anyone.  The heroes are bad.  The villains are worse.  It has no problem dismembering people for a \\"laugh.&#34.  I think the movie is a disturbing example of the recent trend of having no respect for anything or anyone, but given all that, it's good and funny.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Great action and plot.  It also had many cool and funny lines.  Provided the ideal diversion while I ran on my treadmill.
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|The book was in perfect shape and delivered to me in short time. Jeffery Archer is fun to read even though he leaves you hanging in the end. Will purchase the next series.
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my sister and she loved it! There is not a song on the album that I don't love. JT outdone himself once again
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|this is a movie where you don't have to think and you can just veg out. I think the cursing is a bit over the top and not really needed, but the concept of the movie is good.
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|This movie is colorful, funny, creative and worth the purchase. It has meaning and thought put into it and has a general theme of developing character in your child.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I like this game, but the app won't let you deal the next round of cards if there's an open spot on the board. I've had to unstack some of my runs to get the next set of cards. This is the single annoying factor in the game as far as I'm concerned.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|starts off in black and white just like the old one. VERY colorful once it moves into the rest of the movie. Odd acting but I think that is an effort to make it like old time movie acting. It's a good movie but just not a great movie.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Tons of layouts, and an option to dim tiles that are unavailable make this an enjoyable and addicting game. It times you and ranks your game as well, features some people like but I don't really pay attention to.
B009CGKW10|5.0|so great to have a digital copy of this movie<br />we love this classic so much<br />who wouldn't want to go to dinosaur land?!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I use Google Calendar online, and this app syncs seamlessly with my online calendar. I have the same app on my phone, so no matter where I am I can see my calendar, add/delete/change events, and it will send me reminders for upcoming events. The app is easy to use and has a lot of ways to customize the interface, from the font (including color) to the background and sharing options. Views include day, week and month, with options to scroll or swipe through the months. It's a bit pricey for a calendar, but worth every penny for me (and I've recommended it to several family members).
B00992CF6W|4.0|i wish there were better updates like the rest of you guys... but they have come out with one update. also for those of you who cant open the app, try opening it from a different screen, like from the app page or the list of app. your welcome in advance, and if i didnt help you, im very sorry. :(
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I'm still wiping away my tears after finishing this book. It was so different than any other book I've read recently. I loved the narrative aspect-I felt that the main character inspired me to self examine my own body language/actions when in similar situations.<br />I can't recommend this book enough, but make sure you have some tissue nearby.
B00002EPJH|5.0|A perfectly relaxing, beautiful cd!  I love to put it on after work and relax into the beautiful and harmonious melodies.
B009K72G8I|5.0|Best season yet. Only complaint is that its going to be the last one. Really disappointed it won't be continued. How can you bring maul back and leave it open like that???
B009VIZDLI|2.0|Totally predictable. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I can't understand what all they hype is about. Mediocre at best.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender s game is a good scifi book with cool characters and a solid story. Nice twists that you don't expect. Read the book before the movie comes out!!!!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Great, brief follow up to Voyager! Really gets the story moving again. Full of heart-break, love, mystery, and suspense! Ready for the next one!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Superb acting!  Omar Sy's performance is excellent.  This is a must-see feel good movie.  I do not purchase many movies, but this is one that I just had to own.  Don't be afraid of subtitles.  Watch it once and just concentrate on reading the words.  Watch it again and concentrate on the acting.  Very well made, excellent performances by all.  And yes, it is very funny.  Great mix of music throughout the film.  America is going to remake this movie.  Do yourself a favor and see the original.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Very muffled, people that call me can't hear me but they hear themselves very much reverb...  Can't change volume or turn off ringer without fighting with buttons.  Too much trouble not worth it.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|A wonderful children's movie that adults will enjoy.  Saw this the first time as an adult when it came out almost 20 years ago and it became one of my favorite movies.  The animals are funny, sweet and endearing.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Apparently the only way to finish this game is to pay straight through. After finishing chapter 9 the game wouldn't load after I saved and returned. I tried paying again and it wouldn't load after saving and returning to chapter 4. This game starts out pretty cool until it won't let you finish. I want my money back!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|a lot of tears in this documentary. I was left wondering what happened to all those amazing dancers who worked so hard to be chosen.

B0052AC8C6|4.0|I like Johnny Depp, so that's why I watched it. Entertaining. Well done with great music and effects. Not a bad way to enjoy an hour and a half.
B00D4E9BDQ|5.0|I first heard about Disclosure after reading their cover story in a recent issue of DJ Times Magazine.  Disclosure is an English duo formed of brothers Guy (22 years old) and Howard (19 years old).  Their productions evoke vocal house music of the early 1990s, but with a modern twist.  The album feature a variety of male and female vocal artists who compliment Disclosure's lush electronic arrangements.  This is an album that you can listen to over and over while working, driving or partying.  The productions are refreshingly complex - particularly considering Disclosure's youth.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:  Latch (f/Sam Smith), January (f/Jamie Woon) and Help Me Lose My Mind (f/ London Grammar).  In fact, I love all of the songs!  As a working DJ, I've already begun playing out tracks from this album.<br /><br />\\"Settle\\" is a magnificent album, and I look forward to future music from this talented duo.

B009CG9CXO|5.0|I clearly recall waiting two hours in line to see Jaws in the theatre in 1975. Now I've introduced it to my daughter at the same age. Still great in HD.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I loved the 3 DVD set that I preordered. I am a long time Eagles fan & it was great to spend a full evening watching this history.
