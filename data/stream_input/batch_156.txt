B00003CWL6|5.0|I am a little more than amazed at some of the BAD reviews of this film ranging from &quot;lame story&quot; to &quot;so what.&quot;<br />Do we understand what we have here?  It's not meant to be thrilling, spine-tingling, or nail-biting action.  It's meant to take a picture of America that all of us know so well exists, and yet we deny it so vehemently to our friends.  &quot;Our marriage is fine.&quot;  &quot;We have a good, well-behaved boy.&quot;<br />Who knows?  &quot;Look closer&quot; is a sign you find in Kevin Spacey's cubicle and I will not try to be blase in saying that it IS the overall theme in the movie, but it comes pretty close to the mark.<br />Is everything you expect it to be?  Are American neighborhoods truly the sanctum of the &quot;decent living&quot; that we all say that it is?  No.  The opening scene with Anette Benning in the front lawn is just a simple, yet powerfully shot scene of the &quot;mask&quot; that we put on ourselves to suppress the futility we feel in our own lives.  &quot;Look closer&quot; at a mid-life crisis, a frustrated wife, a confused and underappreciated teenage girl, another teenage girl displacing sexual insecurity by being overtly sexual, and the drug-selling boy next door who so much wants to find beauty in his own life that he seeks it elsewhere--we don't often realize that everyone goes through a silent misery of pain everyday.  Stop saying &quot;I'm fine&quot; to everyone when you're not...a great deal can be accomplished if we were all a little more honest with each other.<br />Can you not say that you can't relate to someone or yourself in this film?  I'll be 100% amazed if you can.  I, for one, can relate to the side of the &quot;disturbed-boy-next-door&quot; who sees unusual beauty in mundane, every-day situations.  <br />I would like to definitely put my 10 cents in on the final scene.  What does the boy find beautiful about Kevin Spacey in the end?  Because Kevin Spacey has finally found a frozen moment in time when everything WAS wonderful in his life--only to be frozen in eternity.<br />Please don't listen to those who say &quot;I don't get it.&quot;  Those who don't get it probably deserve a casting role in this film, ironically.
B000002B7M|5.0|With the brilliant find of metal guitar pre-royalty, the late Randy Rhoads, and the.. shall we say &quot;eclectic&quot;? songwriting talent (not to mention the WONDERFULLY unique vocals), of His Ozzness, &quot;Blizzard&quot; is destined to be a top metal classic for all time. While &quot;Crazy Train&quot; is undoubtably the most memorable and requested track for all the riff, errr... right reasons, I can listen to &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot; (a ballad, no less.  Who knew?) followed immediately by &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; ad infinitum.  Re &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;, I simply wish 'folks' would actually LISTEN to all of the lyrics before they voice/act-upon their uninformed conclusions. Quite a song.   I was blown away with this debut in '79, and it still gives me thrill-chills 22 years later!  From &quot;I Don't Know&quot; through &quot;Steal Away the Night&quot;, this is pure, fire-hardened metal.  What metal was meant to be, from one of the originators.  Many thanks to Bob and Don (excellence, boys!), Peace to Randy, and Luv to the Ozzman! It jus' don't get no betta than this.  A MOST E-ssential essential for any true metal collector.
B00005BL2A|4.0|DM has been my favorite band for over 15 years now, and after hearing this album, they still rank #1 in my book. I think that DM has been trying to enter into a new phase since the dark, drug infested days of SOFAD. With the departure of Alan Wilder, the band seems to be striving for a new DM sound. After listening to this album a few times, I think I like it better than Ultra. They are still keeping with &quot;many slow songs and very few fast songs&quot; as they did with Ultra, but this one seems to have alot more keyboards and &quot;new&quot; sounds that true DM fans have always known and loved. Dream On, Shine, I Am You, and the instrumentals seem to be the classic DM songs, while The Dead of Night reminds me of something like Master and Servant, but in 2001 and not 1985. I Feel Loved is a awesome groove, and Comatose seems like it could have belonged on Martin Gore's solo e.p., Counterfeit. DM has always been famous for not repeating the previous album, and I think they have succeeded with Exciter. I think true, longtime DM fans will understand that this band has been through so much in its 20+ years, and there is no way they are ever going to stay the same. They are older, they have lost the main productionist, and of course, the drugs and health problems didn't help. But DM has survived all this trauma and I am very thankful. I will probably always love DM no matter which direction they go, and I think with Exciter, they are learning what DM is all about again. Even in their early days when A Broken Frame was released, (with just David, Martin and Fletch) that album was not the upbeat, dancy album that Violator was. Exciter and Ultra seem to be slightly modeled after a Broken Frame with the semi slow songs and instrumentals. To me, DM with Alan Wilder was a dancy, poppy sound, and without him, a slower, more moody sound.  For those of you who are looking for another Violator or SOFAD, you'll be disappointed. DM will NEVER repeat that again, and if you are a true fan, you will understand that.
B00005BJPO|1.0|Although the only people who click through to this will be fans, so I'll be derided for all time, I have to say that there was a point in this film when I woke up and still wasn't interested.<br />Remember Astro Boy? I do!
630463949X|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Music DVD I have seen, even my wife liked it (and she doesn't particularly like Fleetwood Mac).  Lindsey Buckinghams voice has changed since the Rumours album days, but the overall effect is the same.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone.
B00005B36H|5.0|I really just wanted to add my share to the praise voiced by other people here.  Tool is truly something altogether original and their music defies attempts at description and categorization.  Since I am perfectly aware that anything I say about the music on this album will be no more than my own personal opinion, I will not say anything.  But I believe that the mark of a true work of art is that it resonates strongly with different people, albeit it may do so in many different ways.  I am convinced that this album is indeed a work of art.
B000005RT8|2.0|I'm Not Sure How To Describe This One. Paul's Experiment I Guess. It Is Not Agreeable With My Tastes, But I'm Sure Some People Will Like It. I've Listened To It Twice, That's Enough. I've Always Hated The Musical Wasteland Of The Eighties. Mac Sounds like He's Trying To Blend In With The Other Music Which Was Released Then. Too Bad, He's a Great Composer/Musician.
B0000013G9|5.0|what can i say? This album is a classic. period. With hit's like &quot;waterfalls&quot;, &quot;redlight special&quot;, &quot;creep&quot;, &quot;kick your game&quot; and the under-rated &quot;diggin on you&quot; you have all you will ever need! if you don't have this album where have you been! You need to get it! It's a must have! definately get the 3rd release FAN MAIL, it tops this one!
B00005B36H|5.0|When you see a picture of these four guys, they seem regular. When you listen to these guys as Tool they seem far from regular. Tool is a fantastic combination of intelligent metal and progrock with intense and emotional vocals. I thought nima was great, but Lateralus is even better! The new mark in rock history hits off with a great riff driven by Danny Careys drums and Maynards hardhitting vocals and lyrics. The hit single Schism sounds better on CD than radio, but the definitive climax is reached in Parabol/ Parabola that combined gives you the best track on the album. Quiet music with Maynards tender voice jumps in to the best metal song since nima. Jimmy Page is thought of as the best riffmaker in rock, it`s about time they update that list and add the name Adam Jones. After listening to Lateralus with Salival fresh in mind, I can`t wait to see them play at this years Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Buy it, listen to it and go out and get the other albums as well.
B00003CXRM|2.0|Are you mad? I sat and watched this long, slow drawn out movie and started getting itchy pants. Nothing happens for what seems like hours. The dialogue is sometimes fast (Clooney), but always irritating. The story just goes on and on and on. I appreciate the references to literary classics, but this just doesn't do anything to add to the actual interest of the film. Miss it. Or if you do see it, write a review here, I would be interested to see if everyone else has been 'fooled' by the artistic content - it is a boring film. Period.
0899668380|5.0|I normally do not like to read books from the horror genre. Occasionally I will read a Stephen King book or something along those lines. I had read some reviews of I Am Legend on Amazon, and when I saw it at the library, it was a very thin book, so I thought why not.<br />What I found was an Orwellian book about human nature, about the desire to continue on, to assimilate. I would compare this book to Animal Farm on several levels.<br />Furthermore, the writing is superb. I understand that this was only Matheson's third book, but his brilliance with the written word, and his understanding of the human condition, was already evident.<br />Horror fans should not miss reading this book. I am not an expert on horror writing, but I believe this book would have to be considered on of the best ever written in that genre. However, if you are not a horror or vampire fan, you should still try this book.<br />I think it would be nearly impossible for anyone who is a fan of great writing to dismiss this book. Read it.
B000001ESP|5.0|After the surprising success of their first hit single &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; (from the 1980 album PERMANENT WAVES), Rush reached their mainstream potential by combining the lengthy progressive epics of their past albums with what would be their new commercial sound on MOVING PICTURES.<br />Released in February of 1981, MOVING PICTURES is considered by many to be Rush's greatest achievement--and rightly so.  Not only is this album the band's masterpiece, but it's my favorite album of all time and quite possibly THE greatest album ever made.  Period.  I don't think any album can come close to how perfect this record is (only Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and Led Zeppelin's first album come close).  <br />Rush contains three of the most talented musicians ever formed in a rock band.  From Neil Peart's God-like drumming and intelligent lyrics, to Geddy Lee's soaring vocals and expert bass playing, to Alex Lifeson's complex guitar pyrotechnics, these guys practically define the word &quot;musicianship.&quot;  All the power, energy, intelligence, inventiveness, and musicianship of Rush are held together by this great, great album.<br />&quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; opens the album, with that instantly recognizable synthesizer intro.  Neil Peart steals the show in the middle of the song with a drum solo so fast, it proves why he's one of the greatest drummers ever.  &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; may be the best tune to play when driving down the highway.  A concept song about a young man who travels back in time and finds a bright red car, the lyrics are superb, as is Alex Lifeson's airy guitar solo in the middle.  &quot;YYZ&quot; is the best instrumental I've ever heard.  The playing by all three is brilliant.  Neil Peart's lightning-fast drumming, Geddy Lee's phenomenal bass lines, and Alex Lifeson's guitar solos are all captured perfectly.  &quot;Limelight,&quot; a song about the price of fame, contains another great solo by Alex and a chorus that you can't get out of your head.<br />&quot;The Camera Eye&quot; is Rush's last epic composition, with a running time of almost 11 minutes.  Don't be fooled by the length; there's so much happening in the song that it goes by quickly.  It contains probably the longest introduction ever (at 3 1/2 minutes).  &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; is by far the best song on the record.  Probably Rush's darkest tune, the ominous and thoughtful lyrics and Neil Peart's sledgehammer beat set the mood as Geddy Lee's touching synthesizer part paved the way for what Rush would do on their next album (1982's SIGNALS).  &quot;Vital Signs&quot; closes out the record with an Andy Summers-ish guitar riff, even more complex lyrics, and a nice melody.<br />Although there are only seven songs, that's no reason to not go out and buy MOVING PICTURES.  Rush is an amazingly gifted trio with many great albums, but this is their best work.  If I were making a Top 5 list of my favorite albums, MOVING PICTURES is definitely heading straight for the top.
B00005AQAW|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Feeder to death.  They are definitely one of my favorite bands aside from the likes of Incubus, Vast, Our Lady Peace and such... but their newest disc &quot;Echo Park&quot; is just missing an element found in the previous Feeder records.  They seem to have watered down the emotional level, and replaced it with an overdose of pop to make the music more friendly to radio.  I miss the old feeder sound.  Loud heavily distorted guitars, insane effects and clever, deep lyrics.  1999's Yesterday Went Too Soon wasn't the greatest CD ever (nothing will ever beat Polythene)... but it managed to be both poetic and loud at the same time.  Echo Park isn't really either.  It's powerpop with minimal heart and a plethora of trite lyrics.  <br />Enough bashing one of my favorite bands.. I like the cd.  It sounds great, and has some really good songs on it.  Piece by Piece is a beautiful ballad along with Turn, Tell All Your Friends, and 7 Days in the Sun being the other gems of the CD.  Oxygen and Standing on the Edge had the potential for greatness, but didn't quite hit the mark.  Choke and Bug should have been left off the album.  <br />My recommendation is if you want a good cd with some cool songs on it, buy this.  Its worth the money, but it didnt meet my expectations... and certainly doesnt show off what Feeder is capable of by any means.
B00005B36H|3.0|well folks its good but not that good.  i feel like the only one but i really wanted to hear some more &quot;power tool&quot; on this album but all i got was some more, much-to-mellow APC stuff.  i really wasnt impressed with that album either.  i was hoping for some more songs like part of me and opiate but i guess i should have guessed that the band had &quot;matured&quot; over the years and wanted to move forward.  so in closing i want to say yhtat the album is good but if you want to hear the REAL tool sound, check out aenima.
B00005B36H|5.0|Being a mason myself I enjoyed every aspect of the cd. If there was a bad review about it, it was the person typing it through their narrow minded view of the world transferred to the screen. People don't like or fear what they don't understand. This album showed me every angle of myself as well as this world. It took me through a journey of the world and what comes next. And, as maynard discovered, using ancient geometry, the tones in his voice can have a magical affect on people. Sit down, put head phones on, put your room to the spiral (1+1+2+3+5+8+13+21+etc...), and experience what is next for the humans. Evolution is among us, we are the new way, we will guide you through the chaos, and Tool will lead us when we stray. Thank you guys...
6305127689|5.0|I have that movie on DVD. On my TV screen it is just new. This is a decent movie to fly a plane. I like to ride it someday when I am older. And I like the songs that are in this movie.
B000056NX4|4.0|As far as the acting goes Jerome Pradon is the highlight of this version.  As for his singing, though far from perfect, I think it suits the character of Judas well (listen to Murray Head from the orginal concept album as Jerome seems to stick closer to it than other versions I've heard).  He is the most charismatic performer in the production, sadly, perhaps the only.  I wasn't impressed with Glenn's Jesus and was downright turned-off by the guy who played Pilot.  The other actors were *ok*.  The music is great of course and visually the production is very entertaining.
B00005B36H|4.0|Well, I had been looking forward to this album a lot, and I think my expectations were too high.  It's a great album musically, but it lacks the intellectual aura of Ænima.  Also I feel that the lyrics are too explicit in terms of theme...Maynard explains it all, rather then leaving some element of mystery to the lyrics; however, this is understandable, as he seems to be explaining the lack of intellectual lyrics in &quot;Lateralis,&quot; (listen to it, and you'll know what I mean), one of my favorite tracks.  I must comment on the track, &quot;Reflection,&quot; (also a favorite track)...something about it is very primitive, a trait augumented by the drumming (Danny Carrey's drumming is brilliant on this album).  Justin and Adam meld bass and guitar beautifully, as well.  Tool has grown very much since Opiate in these aspects.  Also, Maynard seems to have had adopted more of a variety of vocal styles since his liasion with A Perfect Circle...which is good in some places, but in a way, I feel a bit disapointed because Tool has more of a A Perfect Circle vibe throughout the album.  <br />Nonetheless, I am sure that Lateralus will continue to grow on me, and I will be able to enjoy it more later.  I suppose it is the transition from intellectual lyrics to more personal, closer lyrics which is a challenge for me. Still, for now, Aenima remains to be my favorite Tool album.
0767836286|4.0|Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but the ending completely caught me off guard.  I was so engrossed with the movie and the excellent acting therein.<br />You get the feeling though that director Mark Pellington would not be shy to have a non-standard plot line.  Half way through the movie I found myself wondering if Tim Robbin's character really was a terrorist.  Especially when Tim Robbin's character confronted Jeff Bridges' character.  For a moment I wondered if Mark would risk making a movie about a terrorist that isn't actually a terrorist.  But then I realized that would be a pretty boring movie.<br />Getting back to the end of the movie, it brought the whole thing together.  It tied in with the classes that Jeff Bridges' character taught.  He said in his classes that these terrorist that blow up buildings usually have good things going for them (just got a raise, etc.).  Everyone that knows them says, \\"I just never imagined that he would do something like that.\\"  The question is: Why would they commit an act of terrorism?  They seem to have no motive.  The answer?  Watch the movie.
B00005ATQM|5.0|metallica clearly shows the greatness of technology. This is how music should sound. Absolutly stunning. Any one interested in great sound (specificaly surround sound) this DVD-Audio is for you. You can't even compare this to the CD. I recomend this title to anyone who has any doubts about the format, to experince the music not just to listen.
B00005A1PR|3.0|... still better than many others. India.Arie doesn't even come near Jill Scott or Erykah Badu on her first album, but still she's somehow not mainstream. She has a nice, warm, soft voice, and at first makes you listen up, but then the songs sound pretty much the same, a bit like &quot;neither fish nor flesh&quot;. So this is three stars to me. Still, she has a lot of potential, so maybe next album ...?
B000056HUA|5.0|The engineering of this disk is very different from most.  The vocals are largely monaural from the center speaker.  Instruments are sometimes isolated, coming from a single speaker.  What this disk reminded me is that stereo sound is a form of a special effect.  If you buy this disk with an open mind, you will love it.
6302054982|5.0|Goodfellas is one of the greatest movies ever made, plain and simple. DeNiro, Pesci, Liotta, Brasco, and Sorvino all turn in fabulous performances. A truly timeless classic, one everybody should own.
B00005AAFS|5.0|The german guys did it again! Another fabulous album by Rammstein. Strong, beautiful, fantastic... The whole album is great, bu Sonne is a standout.
B000059HAI|5.0|Excellent and well made film with incredible stunts and special effects.It's amazing no stuntmen were killed on the set (although two died during rehearsal prior to filming).  Made in 1970 as a joint Japanese/American production at a cost between 25 and 30 million dollars . Every scene is meticulously re-created from historical records, including most of the dialogue.The attack was  filmed before the advent of computer animation, which makes it even more amazing. This dvd was re-released with  the director's commentary which is very boring and prodding, with very little insight into the making of  the film and ignores commentary scene by scene. You'd think they weren't even watching the film!  I bought this re-release (already had the original dvd with no special features) for the commentary and was extremely dissappointed.(I hate it when dvd's are re-released with new special features!) I guess they penalize the diehards by making us buy the dvd over and over again.Regardless, this is the BEST film ever made about Pearl Harbor. No mention of a Roosevelt conspiracy - (as it should be, since the conspiracy theory has major flaws) and no, I'm not a Roosevelt lover or hater. I believe in documentation, not conjecture and speculation. &quot;Just the facts please&quot;... which is what this film is all about.
B00000DG1R|5.0|A totally great CD from one of the greatest bands of all time!!! A tribute to fab five Simon LeBon, John Taylor, Nick Rhodes, Andy Taylor and Roger Taylor.  The compilation contains the essential hits of the Birmingham five.   Looking down memory lane, I still could recall buying my first Duran Duran album,  idolizing John Taylor back in highschool and recording on &quot;betamax&quot; all their muisc videos.  &quot;The Reflex&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot;, &quot;Save A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;New Moon On Monday&quot;,&quot;View To A Kill&quot; and &quot;&quot;Union Of The Snake&quot; are all time favorites of mine.  Too bad &quot;Careless Memories&quot; wasn't included in this selection. &quot;Last time La Luna, I light my torch and waived for the New Moon on Monday........&quot;
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is the first DVD I ever bought, and it was a great purchase. Even if you have it on VHS or on an earlier DVD edition, I would highly recommend buying this version because of its new features. I'm sure everyone knows the plot: Humans vs. Machines after WWIII, the first terminator was sent back in 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, but the human resistance sent back Kyle Reese, both of them died in the first movie. In this movie, a terminator superior to Arnold is sent back to kill John Connor, but this time Arnold is protecting him. Arnold's nemesis, the T-1000, is a stunning visual achievement, with the liquid metal and morphing, and Arnold does a great job as the T-800. The acting in this movie is good all around, I can't think of a single bad performance. The writing is great, not a single scene suffers because of it. The special edition is even better, with new scenes and lots of materials on how the movie was made, plus lots of bios. Check it out if you are a fan of sci-fi or action.
B00003CXB6|4.0|When I saw Jurassic Park in the theateres back in 1993, I liked it back then, and to this day I still do. I especially enjoyed the part in the movie that explained how the dinosaurs were cloned, using blood found in fossilized prehistoric mosquitoes. That was the most convincing explanation I'd ever heard in a movie that answered how humans and dinosaurs ever came face to face. It was such a good explanation that it almost made you wonder if it was actually possible. Soon after, we were told from scientists that it wasn't. Oh, well. It was a good adventure movie anyway, and was loaded with some of the most amazing visuals ever to hit the silver screen. Four years later, The Lost World: Jurassic Park was made. Although I was pleased that most of the people involved with the first had returned, I was deepley dissapointed by the way the story had been changed so much from the novel. Perhaps Spielberg changed it in the hopes he'd get lucky the same way he did with Jaws. Unfortunatley, that didn't happen, and the movie sufffered greatly as a result of it. I also didn't approve the way in which the dinosaurs, especially the velociraptors, had been changed in both appearance, and intelligence. They were no longer the skilled cunning killers they were in the original, which diminished their presence, and made them far less interesting to watch, especially for over two hours. And it looked like the filmmakers were trying too hard to make them look scary. The neon, practically glowing, yellow eyes really didn't work for me. And lets face it, dinosaurs aren't scary. They're not monsters, just animals that existed long before us, and amazing ones too. And protraying them as nothing more than monsters, who want only to hunt man just seems unreal and stupid. <br /> Once scene that bothered me in particular was when Malcom's daughter manages to get the best of one using her gymnastics skills! As if!<br />All in all, The Lost World's only asset were its special effects. It's too bad the plot, characters, and musical score weren't at least as good as the original's, but that seems to be a common trend among sequels. Fortunatly, Jurassic Park III improved upon The Lost World by offering more dinosaur interaction, smarter characters, though that still isn't saying much. Jurassic Park 3 also ditched those annoying issues about saving the dinosaurs from the evil hunters that appeared in The Lost World. I felt like I was watching a Disney movie. I hope Spielberg has the sense to stay away from the Jurassic Park franchise from now on. Sequels and Spielberg don't mix. They never have, and they never will. And if the next one ends up being like the second installment, it may spell doom for the Jurassic Park franchise. It would be a shame to see something like that happen, because I really enjoyed Jurassic Park, and I know there are stories out there far better than the one used in this movie. I just hope the people who actually make these movies will find one before its too late.
B000002H2H|5.0|This CD is great! Being the first Metallica CD i've ever listened to, this is the CD that got me liking the band. Ever since I heard the musical masterpiece FADE TO BLACK, I've have never found a song that you can listen to when you feel like listening to slow music, and also when you feel like listening to Hard music. This is just one of the great songs on the album, and with this, there will never be a dull moment with this CD. Go out and by it. You wont regret it.
B00005B36H|4.0|...But still better than most other stuff out there.  <br /> Lateralus is a lot more laid back than TOOL's other albums. It's great to turn off the lights and the TV, lay back on the couch and just relax. You kind of go of in your own little world. aaahhh...pure heaven.<br /> ...the coolest cover I've ever seen! Only TOOL could think that up!
B00005B36H|5.0|...  Well.  The wait was worth it.  The new tool album is insanely good.  The druming in Ticks And Leeches is one of the RARE cases in modern rock where Drums steal a show, and for your all its worth, they should steal the show.  I feel Carey is possibly one of the best drummers alive, and the whole album is driven by his Rythemic Power.  The Loose slap sound of the bass in this album is great.  Heard Specificly in the Opening Track, The Grudge, Chancellor's bass makes the song move, with all the rythem of Sepultura, without the tribal feel.  Jone's Riff fit into classic tool sound wonderfuly, With &quot;Parabola&quot; showing his power with &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; and Parts of &quot;Ticks And Leeches&quot; showing his overall emotion in his riff. Tool drops another must buy for ANYONE with Lateralus.
6304119046|5.0|In this extraordinary drama, we learn of one man's life through the eyes of his peers and colleagues.<br /> We delve into the life of Charles Foster Kane, as we search for the answer to one question: What is &quot;Rosebud,&quot; Kane's last word?<br /> I did not want to see this film. I simply watched it because I love movies and this was apparently &quot;essential.&quot; It turned out that everyone who says this movie is unbelievable is right. The story of Charles Foster Kane (who is believed by some to have been based upon William Randolph Hearst) is amazing. From his life at Xanidu to his childhood to the NY Inquirer back to Xanidu, the movie is simply perfect.   <br /> By way of magnificent and unorthidox cinematography, superb direction, stunning acting, and a haunting plot, Orson Welles tells this seemingly simple tale in a memorable, ununprecedented fashion. An absolute must- see for anyone.
0684833395|3.0|this is an ok book, but the movie was much better, the book drags a little too much, you would also need to read it a few times to really understand what the author is trying to say.
B000003TA4|5.0|The Last Great Rock album, by the Last Great Rock Band, NEVER MIND opens with the Last Great Rock Single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;  It is a moment that changed the sound of popular music as surely as SGT PEPPER or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or THRILLER did, and it's effect on pop culture, now going on 10 years, has been as lasting as it's predecessors.<br />Kurt Cobain was a great guitar player, a great song writer, and a fantastic singer, but his true genius was finding a way to blend the previously untamed punk/grunge sound he heard all around him with a Pop format.  The result, found most purely on NEVER MIND, was a hybrid more powerful and energetic than anything since LONDON CALLING, more than a decade earlier.<br />Cobain's curse, of course, was obsessive self-criticism and self-doubt.  What other cerebral rocker would have written (and sung at length) &quot;I think I'm dumb&quot;?  He wasn't dumb, not by a long shot, and I mark his death as the end of Rock.<br />This is a stunning album, from start to finish.  The decade past and the imitators that have filled it haven't dated this LP; their short-falling attempts only prove what a massive force Nirvana was.<br />Listen to &quot;Come As You Are&quot; and try to think of anything on it--a single word, a single note--that you could change to improve it.  Listen to &quot;Breed&quot; and try to come up with a more energetic sound you've heard lately that wasn't a thinly-veiled copy of this very record.  <br />Most of all, listen to &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;  If there has been a better explanation of what it is to be young and cornered recorded in the last 20 years, I haven't heard it.
B000002IP1|4.0|I have been a fan ever since I heard &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; when I was only 7 years old, I didn`t even knew the language when I heard it.  This album have many difference sounds, from the beautifull ballad &quot;The way it is&quot; which is about war and what affects it has on the familys and the people who love those who are dying in the war, NEED I SAY MORE, GREAT LYRIC! I always get tears in my eyes when I listen to it, even just the melody  speaks to my heart.  And the you have the uptempo song &quot;Something Happened on the Way to heaven&quot; which features great instruments with a certan Jazz influence, but still has the typicially pop song.  The song &quot;I wish it could rain down&quot; is a love ballad in famous Phil style.<br />But still no songs of him have ever touched my soul and heart like &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; it was one of the songs that got me into music.  The lyrics speaks about homeless people, and how we treat them, and how they feels about the whole situation, DISCRIMINATION is an important word.  The melody is BEAUTIFUL and you just got to admit that songs can have an affect appart from just being &quot;music&quot;.  Well although my music taste have changed alot since the time, this is a real classic.  Hope he comes up with a masterpiece again soon(like his stuff with Genesis), Buy this music fans-:)
B0000028SU|3.0|Although it's a major lull between his epoch early period and has surprisingly strong recent years, LUCKY TOWN (and the even weaker HUMAN TOUCH) has a few great moments.<br />Those moments tend to be the ones that put his weak (at least in comparison to the E-Street Band) backup musicians low in the mix.  &quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot; could have fit seamlessly on TUNNEL OF LOVE. &quot;Book Of Dreams&quot; might have slipped onto TOM JOAD--sonically, anyway, thematically there is no similarity.  But when this band gets loud, it's not a lion roaring, as the E-Street was.  It's like a bag of glass and nails and rusty tin cans falling down a flight of stairs.<br />All that aside, everyone should own a copy of &quot;Beautiful Reward,&quot; a song so brilliant, so full of the kind of light that Springsteen is able to find in life, that it's worth sitting through the first 9 tracks.
B00000JXV8|1.0|A good cast but appaling film. It was unbelievable and predictable, I fast forwarded most of it. I mean, who has a weding in a middle of a tornado? Who gets their purse stolen and immediately goes on a shopping spree afterwards? it is said to be a romantic comedy, although nothing was funny apart from the stupidity of it, and there was hardly any romance. This is one of the worst movies Ive seen and i advise anyone with sense NEVER to see it.
6302794331|5.0|But this is one tale that never even approaches the sights of boredom.  A truly fantastic film, personally by far my most favourite Muppets' caper, with the likes of Michael Caine as the tight fisted Ebenezer Scrooge; in search of the Ghosts of Past, Present, and Future.<br />The Muppets are reassembled for this musical version of Charles Dickens' classical tale, and are out in force with Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie and not forgetting Rizzo, all delivering hilarious and moving performances; the men up high, or rather underneath should be praised.<br />Having thoroughly enjoyed Patrick Stewart's latest Television/Stage Version, it is great to just get back to the madness and fun of this Muppet outing.  It makes me cry with tears of laughter and sadness everytime, ultimately an amazing film.<br />Are you a Muppet fan... this is still their best yet.
B000053V7Q|3.0|The concept is brilliant - rework the &quot;hatchet&quot; job that Dennis Sanders did on the original movie, cut out all the annoying interviews and fan club meetings and just show Elvis doing what he did best - knocking them dead on stage and in rehearsals.  The extra footage, CD quality sound and different camera angles are all done brilliantly (although the sound is a little patchy in places). The reworking of &quot;Patch it up&quot; is worth the money on it's own - it is sensational. Which leaves me with only one very serious criticism,can anyone please tell me why so many of the original songs were cut out? Where is &quot; I just can't help believing&quot; ( arguably his finest live song), &quot;Bridge over troubled water&quot; to name a few? Ultimately these ommissions spoil what should have been the rightful ressurrection of a flawed original. What were they thinking?
B000056PWV|5.0|I don't feel like saying a whole lot. The only thing that needs to be said is that this is a fricken brilliant piece of film history and one of stewarts best.
B00004S35Z|5.0|It is impossible to overrate Stevie Wonder's album releases in the 1970s. &quot;Fulfillingness' First Finale&quot; was the fourth in a string of masterpieces that began with 1972's &quot;Music Of My Mind&quot;, although it is slightly overlooked (as far as a  multiplatinum #1 album can be overlooked, that is).  Perhaps it is the mellower atmosphere (although no more so than &quot;Talking Book&quot;), or perhaps it is that it followed 1973's overwhelming &quot;Innervisions&quot;.  Perhaps it is that it does not<br />really vary much from the winning formula he established on the previous three releases--whatever the case, &quot;Fulfillingness&quot; is equally as strong as these, and improves with each listen.      <br />The two upbeat hits, &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman&quot; and the Nixon attack &quot;You Haven't Done Nothin'&quot;, ground the album in hardcore funk rhythms (the former mixing its sound with reggae accents).  The other eight tracks are midtempo pop songs and ballads, colored by Wonder's ever-innovative<br />banks of keyboards, and if there is any difference between these and ones on earlier albums, it is that they frequently sound more eerie and haunting.  Right from the opening &quot;Smile Please&quot;, Wonder's voice sounds slurred and yearning, which lends a subtle sense of irony to the cheerful lyric; it is the more mature flipside to &quot;You Are The Sunshine Of My Life&quot;.  &quot;Too Shy To Say&quot; and the classically-inspired &quot;They Won't Go When I Go&quot; are absolutely chilling, with tastefully sparse arrangements augmenting the minor-key histrionics.  &quot;Creepin'&quot; is a strong contender for best cut, a mysterious ballad with Arp synths lacing themselves around the vocal.  Although the sluggish and overrated &quot;Heaven Is 10 Zillion Light Years Away&quot; presages Wonder's soppier later material, the album closer &quot;Please Don't Go&quot; sounds like the pop hit that never was.  While the album lacks the cohesive sense of social and political commentary that fired &quot;Innervisions&quot;, it sounds more personal, and its overall sense of resignation mirrors that of other critically acclaimed releases of the post-Watergate era such as Neil Young's &quot;On The Beach&quot; and Robert Wyatt's &quot;Rock Bottom&quot;.
6305169187|1.0|Not even worth Talking about it. One thing I can say is that Alfred Hitchcock's, Orson Welle's, and Stanley Kubrick's worst movie is better than this; as is the same for most directors. Not even worth the special effects. How much special effects do you think Hitchcock used in Psycho, or Welles in Citizen Kane. They are great movies because of scripts, acting, directing, and the lack of shots and scenes that don't mean squat(alot of them in Armegeddon). THis movie relies on the conjuring up of fake emotions. It's blooody funny to watch. The only movie in recent memory that's make me cry is 'Shadow Of a Doubt' By Hitchcock( Charlie cries on the porch while watchcing her family ignorantly play with eachother) If you don't understand what I'm talking about I suggest you whtch the movie. I had to watch it more than once.
B00005B36H|5.0|The only reason I could see people not liking this album is if you were expecting Aenima all over again.  A more singles oriented album, Aenima is the measuring stick against which everyone bases Lateralus, but after 5 years, you can't do that, because this isn't the same band.  A more experimental, relaxed sonic journey this is, and while there aren't as many radio friendly songs as their previous effort, you can tell these guys are a much more cohesive band now.  Never using conventional rhythm's or song structures, these guys have transcended beyond the every day song and given us an album that's worth listening to from start to finish.<br />The Grudge sticks out in my mind as the best track on this album.  It starts out mellow, builds itself into a frenzy, even makes you think it's about to be a standard 4:4 rock song, but then deviates and shows where their true intentions lie.  Schism, being the first single, certainly delivers the goods with an infectious base line that's complemented by the guitar.  Maynard's vocals have never sounded better on this album, and you don't have to wade through strange noises and weird dialogue on this album.  It's non-stop music for 80 minutes, and it's hard to stop once you start.  I'd wait 5 more years for this album.
B00003CXN4|3.0|The wonderful cinematography aside, Traffic is really two movies. The totally believable and gritty story of drug traffic on the border, the unbelievable Hollywood story of Michael Douglas and his daughter. Watch this film for Benicio del Toro, especially the too-brief scene in Tijuana (actually filmed in Nogales) where a young US couple tries to pay off del Toro to help finding their car, and he just refers them to the policia. Poor rich Douglas, his daughter mired in drugs, plays like a TV movie of the week. Any US drug czar wouldn't waste time crusing the drugs streets with another kid user. Instead, the wrath of God would descend on the whole drug scene. Moral of this movie seems to be that if you're white, US, and wealthy, you can solve your problems through family counseling. If you're Hispanic, watch out, the movie doesn't even pretend to offer solutions. If I lived in Mexico along the border, I'd be really furious at the politics of this movie
B00005B36H|2.0|By far the worst Tool album ever. I have been a Tool fan since their first EP, but this is the biggest let down I have experienced in music. There is no passion in the lyrics. It almost seems like this album is B-sides. You are paying for three to four songs at the most. I think Maynard put more effort into A Perfect Circle and eating his cereal than in this album. I have had it since the release date and I still don't like it after days of usage. This is the first Tool album I have to turn off. I can't listen to it from start to end. It is pretty much an instumental album. Hardly any voice at all.
0788816454|2.0|The title I used on this review is true.  It also applies to Jim Carrey.  The first time you see this movie, you will laugh, unless you have no sense of humour.  But after that you question why you laughed, and then not laugh again.  However I gave the movie two stars because Adam Sandler is funny (just not in the waterboy) and Fairuza Balk and Kathy Bates were great.  But why the Fonz?  I don't like Happy Days and I didn't like seeing his face again.
B00002Z88D|1.0|If you want to hear a truly brilliant merging of metal and a symphony...get Yngwie's Concerto cd or a Rhapsody cd and avoid this stinker.  At least those guys can play on the same level with classical musicians.  Hammett couldn't play with a symphony well if his life depended on it...and it shows here.  His horrible sound and note selection rings out like a bad yodeler.  Once again, we hear Hetfield &quot;singing&quot; in his worst register yet.  What happened to this band?  The worst thing is that they butchered some of their better, older songs.  I hope Metallica has learned their lesson to stay in their talent level and leave the classical leanings to the pros like Yngwie, Symphony X, or Rhapsody.
B00005B36H|5.0|Disjointed, non-linear, fragmented.  All of these words have been used to describe Lateralus, unfortunately a vast majority of the masses have refused to take Lateralus as a whole work instead of a radio-friendly track by track cd.  The work that TOOL put into this album is apparent from the beginning of The Grudge.  Time signatures change faster than a blink of an eye and continue throughout the entire work. The track listings for Lateralus are listed only on the cover sleeve, but really they are not needed as it is one long suite.  Maynard James Keenan's vocals HAVE become more restrained on Lateralus, a trait that I did not want to admit as I feared that he would bring his marked change in vocal style and temperament from a APC to TOOL.  However, it works for this album.  Danny Carey turns in some of the most important and influential percussion work in the past 20 years.  Not since Bill Bruford's work on King Crimson's Larks Tongues in Aspic have I ever heard such diversity and power behind the drum kit (check Ticks and Leetches).  Justin Chancellor's bass lines are rich and lavish while Adam Jones sprinkles his beautifully appropriate guitar licks all over Lateralus.  Some TOOL fans will be disappointed upon first listen especially those who loved the harder Opiate and AENIMA.  Lateralus is more akin to Undertow than either of the other two TOOL releases in its mood.  This album will be heralded in the years to come as one of the most important releases in rock history.  TOOL continues to defy mainstream convention and blossom into a quartet of devastating power who just may change the world with their music.
B000056K04|3.0|Almost three years after releasing their best selling work ever, &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, the Dave Matthew's Band releases &quot;Everyday&quot;.  Although the two works come from the same band, it is aparant that the three years has put the group through some major changes.  Such changes include:  Dave playing the electric-baritone guitar, shorter songs (not one over 5 minutes), few solos, a less genuine sound, and a new producer- Glenn Ballard.  This all comes about after the group decided not to release a cd entitled &quot;The Lillywhite Sessions&quot; with their longtime producer Steve Lillywhite.  This ensamble of tracks included most the groups most poplular concert songs such as &quot;Busted Stuff&quot;, &quot;Grey Street&quot;, &quot;Bartender&quot;, and &quot;Big Eyed Fish&quot;.     Although I like the new work by the DMB, I don't think it holds up to the same standards as his other work.  The composition is saved by Dave Matthew's voice in both sound and lyrics.  The lyrics are not as deep as some of the other songs he had on his past CDs.  However, they also deal with different themes such as self-independence.  It is an upbead CD with many quality songs including &quot;What You Are&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;, and &quot;Fool to Think&quot;.  Although I was not a big fan of &quot;I Did It&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; sound as if they are destined to be huge radio hits.   The Dave Matthew's Band has reached a new peak on its musical climb.  For many DMB fans, &quot;Everyday&quot; may be a very disappointing experience because the lack of overall quality that is found in &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot;, and &quot;Remember Two Things&quot;.  However, there is plenty of good tracks on this CD to make any Dave Matthews fan contempt with the groups new direction.
6304696566|4.0|One of the most influential films ever made (see it and have some snobby fun drawing seemingly unlikely connections to Star Wars and Taxi Driver for example), John Ford&#8217;s The Searchers features John Wayne in his favorite and most complex role. When his brother&#8217;s family is wiped out in a Comanche raid, Indian-hating ex-Confederate soldier Ethan Edwards (Wayne) sets off on an epic, ultimately elegiac, search for his kidnapped niece Debbie (Natalie Wood), the sole survivor of the raid. Aided by Debbie&#8217;s half-Indian brother Marty (Jeffrey Hunter), Ethan&#8217;s years of searching will finally lead him to a choice between his racial hatred and his love for his niece. The Searchers is hands down one of the 3 best films in John Wayne&#8217;s legendary career as a cowboy star (the other two being Howard Hawks&#8217; Red River and Rio Bravo). The Searchers is perhaps most notable for its provocative tinkering with Wayne&#8217;s film persona &#8211; rendering him as a cruel racist (rather like the real Wayne himself) who we &#8211; like Marty &#8211; soon begin to suspect is bent on killing his niece should he discover she has &#8220;gone Indian&#8221;. Yet, it is undoubtedly also a technically superb genre work of great directorial craftsmanship with surprisingly grand themes carefully explored in a manner that makes it positively Shakespearean. Featuring stunning signature shots of Ford&#8217;s beloved Monument Valley, The Searchers is ultimately the classic tale of a closing frontier and a man&#8217;s reluctant realization that time and progress have begun to render him and his value system obsolete. Yet, for all its intended genre irony it is nevertheless slightly awkward to wholly and uncritically embrace The Searchers, particularly because one is never quite sure whether the film itself &#8211; despite its self-effacement - revels in the mindlessly cruel treatment meted out by Ethan to Indians. The scene &#8211; unacceptably played for laughs &#8211; in which Ethan and Marty violently assault Marty&#8217;s squaw wife (forced on him by her chief father) is particularly distasteful. Critics will well counter with a number of scenes in which the distance between Ethan&#8217;s extremist character and the closing frontier society around him is emphasized. This would include the scene in which the Reverend questions his cruelty and blind hatred, as well as the famous pathos-tinged, door-frame ending.... And perhaps fans may also point to his grudging warming to his half-breed nephew and eventual decisive encounter with Natalie Wood as something approaching satisfactory redemption. This may well be applicable to the Ethan character, but hardly addresses the issue of the film&#8217;s overall and problematic point of view. It&#8217;s a rather pointless effort to willfully wish away the film&#8217;s racism &#8211; something that even otherwise astute critics have been guilty of. The best example of this unfortunate trend is perhaps Peter Bogdanovich&#8217;s sycophantic leading comment &#8220;The Indians are always given great dignity in your films&#8221; when interviewing Ford on The Searchers in his famous 1968 interviews with the ageing director. Great dignity? The Searchers? What film was Bogdanovich watching? Even Ford himself showed a better awareness of his dubious portrayal of Indians, specifically intending his genuinely dignifying portrayal in his under-appreciated Cheyenne Autumn (1964) to be an antidote to their portrayal in his earlier Westerns. The Searchers is a great movie done no favors by unnecessarily pretending that it is not also politically problematic. Like Griffith&#8217;s The Birth of a Nation this is an undoubted classic &#8211; but one to be to be viewed with some serious reservations.
B000009ROH|4.0|I am one of those die-hard KISS fans (I even have a KISS tattoo) who happens to LOVE this album! In 1981, when it first came out, after the departure of original KISS drummer Peter Criss, to be honest, I thought it was just too non-KISS. But, over time, and especially with the CD remastering, I find it to be one of my favorite KISS albums.    My only disappointment with the album is the song DARK LIGHT. In my opinion, the song drags on too much, especially the lead solo. I get the feeling that Ace Frehley did not give his all and this song proves that.     I have heard both sides of the hate it/love it saga. One of my closest friends finds it to be an unrealistic KISS record. He owns it, but he never listens to it.     As a KISS fan since 1976, I am glad they only did this once. Yet, still, I feel this albums shines.
B000003S0I|1.0|I think that, because of his frustrations and problems with the precedent formations of King Crimson, R. Fripp needed to take a revenge. It's a pity that the victim was the fan.

0375707972|4.0|I just finished The Reader and really enjoyed it. BUT could he really have spent his whole life agonizing over a woman twice his age that he lost his virginity to at age 15?  He worries that he loved someone who could commit a horrible crime but never realizes that she couldn't have been a very moral person to seduce him in the first place. He never loved her - it was simply schoolboy lust.  He didn't even know her and she never called him anything but kid. Obviously he knew the relationship was wrong because he never told anyone about it, yet he allowed it to completely dominate his life. That was sad, but add the Holocaust into the mix and Hannah becomes a complete B----! I found myself wanting to slap some sense into that &quot;kid&quot;.
B000021XS0|5.0|... This CD is incredable.  Dream Theater has very much created one of the best Concept Albums I've heard in awhile.  John Myung's bass is incredable.  John Petrucci's guitar work is outstanding, I play guitar myself, and have bought the guitar book for this album, and I dont understand how he can play such complex stuff!  Mike Portnoy...WOW!  Also being a drummer, he is just inspiring.  Jordan Rudess's keyboard is cool too, many great sound effects have been put into this album, and it sounds great.  And James LaBrie's vocals are jsut unbeliveable!  Anyways, the album is great, one of DT's best yet!  BUY THIS!
B0000019PA|5.0|I've often found the Elephant Six bands to be fiarly inconsistant. Bands like Elf Power or the Apples in Stereo have always had a knack for mixing brilliant pop tunes into albums with just as many filler tracks. NMH doesn't fall into this trap. Aeroplane is quite possibly the most solid album I own. This isn;t an album you listen to for the stand-out tracks, you take the whole thing in for maximum efffect. Try it out. If you like other E6 bands, you'll love this.
6305603847|5.0|One of the most impressive things about DVD is the sound quality you can get on a home system or PC.  Of course The Wall is all about music and the widescreen quality of the DVD is outstanding.  The extras such as the &quot;Hey You&quot; video which was not included in the theater/VHS release are excellent.  And who can forget the trailor for those who grew up during this period.<br />The DVD menu allows you to pick &quot;song selections&quot; from the movie also which really adds to it's value.<br />You won't be disappointed if you are even thinking about buying this on DVD.  An incredible idea and an emotional movie the likes of which have never been done since.  And some of the best, most intelligent and emotional music of the 20th century.
B00003CXPC|2.0|After all the wonderful things I heard about this movie, I was really excited to see it.  Needless to say, after watching it on VHS, I was very disappointed.  The plot was formulaic, the scenes seemed contrived.  There wasn't very much character depth and development, and the acting could have been better.  Some of it just didn't make sense within the flow of the movie, as if certain things were just thrown in for the sake of making the movie longer.  <br />I don't want to trash a movie that everyone else seems to love, but I honestly don't see the appeal.  However, my boyfriend whom I anticipated wouldn't like the film at all gave it favorable reviews, so I guess it does have some sort of mass appeal.  <br />Overall, I guess my expectations were too high from the beginning.  It's a cute, feel-good movie, but I don't think it's deserving of all the acclaim that it's gotten.
B0000507R2|2.0|This DVD-Audio is a re-release of Merchant's best-selling 1995 album. It was one of the first DVD-Audios released - and you have to wonder why this was chosen above so many others. To be sure, Merchant's melancholy voice and these (mostly) effective songs are generally quite appealing. But this is essentially an album focused on a singer-songwriter, and it simply isn't the type of material that cries out for surround-sound treatment. The approach is tasteful, and the sound is quite good. Her voice is usually in all channels, and the mood is sometimes enhanced by a spacious reverb. What about the visual content? When a track starts, there's a photo. Then...nothing happens. But you can periodically hit your remote to advance to the next page of lyrics. Shouldn't this happen automatically? And the lyrics, already printed in the booklet, seem redundant here. Couldn't we see photos of Merchant, or some images that relate to each song? Extras include more text materials better suited to the booklet (bio info, credits, etc.) Another extra is the \\"Carnival\\" video, in CD-quality stereo, not even surround. This is yet another wasted opportunity. Overall, this music is not especially suited for surround, the visual content is strikingly unimaginative (and not even synced to the music), and it suggests something rushed into production without much thought. Surely better DVD-Audios lie ahead. While the music itself might rate 4 stars, as a DVD-Audio it's only 2 stars.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've been waiting for this. TooL has released another great CD. Yes, this sounds like TooL. What were you expecting? Maynard to put on baggy jeans and rap? HELL NO! TooL is TooL. They were innovative when they started out. Why would you want them to change? <br />Another thing, is the long songs. A year ago, I would've found it annoying, but lately, I've been into bands like Opeth, and their average song length is over 7 minutes long. So it doesn't bother me at all anymore.  This CD, in my opinion, is for intended for TooL fans. Someone who's thinking of checking out TooL, are recommended to buy their previous CDs. People, who listen to a lot of the nu-metal, will probably lose patience with the length of these songs. (Most nu-metal songs, from what I can see, are only about 4 minutes long.)
B000002H6C|5.0|On this album Metallica shows why they ruled the metal world at that time. The album starts off furiously with &quot;Blackened&quot; and is followed the the epic title track. The centerpiece of the album is the classic track &quot;One&quot;, but all the tracks rock on this album. I think that one of the most overlooked tracks is &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; which gives &quot;One&quot; a run for its money as which song is the best on the album.  This album is one of the 25 greatest albums of all time and should be part of everybodys collection

B000000OSG|4.0|Starting with the sad, brooding Civil War right on through You Could Be Mine, Illusion II delivers the goods. With the notable exception of Get In The Ring. Such mindless trifle should have been left on the cutting room floor. Despite other's comments, I love the cover of Knockin' On Heaven's Door. Sure, the spoken part at the end is a bit overwrought but Slash's guitar tone is pure Marshall stack glory. 14 Years, sung by Izzy, has that cool Exile-era Stones vibe. There are a couple of mid-tempo, poppier sounding songs that really work (Yesterdays, Breakdown). Izzy chimes in again with the raunchy Pretty Tied Up, which seems to be as much about GnR's coming to terms with fame as it is about a girl who likes kinky sex. Shotgun Blues, despite the title, is actually a pretty punk sounding song. Not quite a throwaway, but not among the better tracks. For my mind the centerpiece of the album is Locomotive. It reminds me of Presence-era Zeppelin. A simple, staccato guitar riff drives the first third of each verse. For the second third of the verse, a overdubbed lead comes in. For the final third the guitar changes to a power chord progression. It's all very Page-like in it's writing and execution and very well done. That the lyrics are better than any Plant ever wrote is icing on the cake. Estranged is simply gorgeous and haunting. Axl thanks Slash for the &quot;awesome guitar melodies&quot; and it's a good thing as Slash makes the guitar cry, wail, and scream at will. For me the album concludes with You Could Be Mine, a riff heavy rocker that would have been right at home on Appetite. Don't even bother with the second iteration of Don't Cry and My World. There you have it. Program your CD player to skip tracks 5, 13, and 14 and you'll be rewarded with probably the best straight ahead hard rock CD of the 90s.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men was the greatest book I've ever read. I read this book with my class and I normally hate the books we read but this one was so good, I read it during the summer also. John Steinbeck created an incredible picture of both the setting and the charcters. The ending was so unexpected and such a surprise that many of the people in my class ended up crying along with me. It became my favorite book and I definitly recommend it to anyone.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I bought this album 2 months ago, and i cant stop listening to it. Its not really different to Jagged Little Pill, Its a bit more louder. I think its alot better than Jagged Little Pill. I find this album more about her emotions. Its a really strong album and it shows that Alanis has put lots of effort to this Album.The Best songs on the album are (UR), (Joining you), (That i would be good) and (I was hoping). If you dont buy it your missing out on a lot!
0375704027|5.0|This is a delicate and measured account of the recollections of a young man's love life.  We learn why he loves and why he's lost, all narrated brilliantly (as only Murakami can) to ensure that the story is both gripping and poised.  Even though the story takes place in the late 60's in Japan, it is completely contemporaneous and mostly universal.
B000006045|5.0|This is no ordinary CD. It is a disease. After listening to Mezzanine, I listen to other CD's but become disappointed because they do not come close to the perfection of Mezzanine.    <br />If you are tired of boring and redundant rock, hip-hop, and rap-rock that are on the radio these days, check out Mezzanine.     Mezzanine breaks many musical boundaries by blending various forms of music.  I will warn you though, once you hear Mezzanine, you may reject the boring radio music. Nuff said, read the other 180+ reviews for details.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I rented this, based on several freinds saying it was a great movie.  This sort of film is not usually my type, but I decided to see it based on one particular strong recommendation.<br />Well, needless to say, I was totally blown away.  Jamie Bell's performance was superb, and his emotional roller coaster ride was extremely convincing.  His dancing was also top notch.<br />The characters did a great job with the hopeless feeling of a struggling town, and the awful effect of the strike on the town's inhabitants.<br />I laughed and cried, as Billy finally breaks free, and his father finally breaks down and admits that maybe he should give his kid a chance.  The scene in the coal yard with Billy's older brother and dad was a serious tear jerker, and showed a previously unseen tender side to a really nasty dad.<br />If I have to complain about anything on this DVD is the over all sound quality, and the very difficult to understand dialect.  There were a few times I had to hit the repeat button to understand what had been said.<br />However, this did not stop me from enjoying the superb movie.  This DVD will now join my growing DVD library on a permanent basis!!!!
0780631684|4.0|good movie with suspense. this movie shows you that you cant cheat death and it will come back to get you. kind of a scary thought if that is how life really was and who knows it isnt. very well done movie a must see.
B00003CXPC|5.0|Billy Elliot goes to the gym in a working-class neighborhood in England to take boxing lessons.  At the other end of the gym he sees ballet lessons going on and he finds that he enjoys dancing more than boxing.  His coal mining father is on strike from the mines and he explodes when he finds out what Billy is doing.  Billy endures taunts from his big brother and his friends, but he perseveres in secret by taking lessons from a woman who believes in his talent.  Eventually he has the opportunity to audition for a major ballet school and to win over those who doubted him.  This movie is beautifully made and the scenes which juxtapose Billy's energetic dancing with the violence of his father's picket line are brilliant.  This is all about gender stereotypes, a young boy's dedication to his dream, and a father's love.  A wonderful movie!
B00005A1PR|5.0|This is a wonderfully rich debut from a very deep sista.  Through her music, India Arie brings messages of self-love, pride, and going for your dreams to all who take the time to listen.<br />&quot;Video&quot; is the track that grabbed my attention, with lyrics like &quot;I've learned to love myself unconditionally because I am a queen.&quot;  Powerful, it reminds us to love the packages we were born with.<br />&quot;Brown Skin&quot; is a sensual track that talks about well, brown skin!  U have to listen for yourself.<br />&quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot; is another uplifting song and like &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Part of My Life&quot; (REAL jams!) it has a great hook.  <br />&quot;Simple&quot; has an infectious beat to it and again, she is telling it like it T-I-Z with lyrics that are subtle, yet sensual.     Her talent for the acoustic guitar is showcased steadily throughout this album (&quot;You're Always in My Head&quot;)<br />This album is like relaxing with a great novel for it gives us a glimpse into her soulful world of music and words.  After that listening to last track, &quot;Wonderful&quot; u know Stevie Wonder is smiling somewhere out there.  Stringing all those song titles into a song?  U GO GIRL!  Continued success, Miss Arie.<br />Peace. CLB.
6304119046|3.0|I rented the film based on the strength of the reviews.  In my opinion, it is a good film but no masterpiece.  One thing about the picture which I found very annoying was the loud blairing circus music when cutting to different scenes.  I wouldn't have rented this movie if I were an MTV junkie.  I appreciate good movies (old and new) but Citizen Kane is not worth buying; rent it instead. <br />One of the qualities of a good movie is that it stays in your mind long after you've seen it.  Citizen Kane doesn't have this lasting effect.  The main character never seems to do any introspection and it was not made clear how he died.  The main character does come to a point in his life where he becomes disillusioned and that (I think) is when he says &quot;Rosebud&quot; then drops the glass ball on the floor.  I have my own theory on what Rosebud meant but I'd rather not spoil the picture.  I'll give you a hint, it's similar to Lester Burham's red pontiac firebird in &quot;American Beauty&quot;.  Anyway, I think it should have been made clear what he meant by rosebud.
B00004XONN|5.0|I just had to write a review after reading some of the stupid, and mindless reviews already here which insult the genius that is Kid A, and the band that produced it... Obviously Kid A is similar to other recordings, and types of music because as with all music it was influenced by other recordings, so yes, as some have suggested, Homogenic by Bjork was probably an influential album for these guys... but what makes good music, is the act of taking influences from other music, and propelling it further, and as far as I'm concerned radiohead has done just this... I have listened to much techno ranging from Aphex Twin to Orbital, and yes, some Bjork as well, but I have never heard anything like this... when you look at the rock music that is out now, it definately doesn't come close to this... Radiohead blend ambient techno (kid a, treefingers, etc) with more abrasive techno (idioteque), and they have straight out rockers like opptomistic, and National Anthem... this mixture alone is worthy of adding the title &quot;Pure Genious&quot; to the album, but when you look at each song, well, you notice just how amazing it is... National Anthem, probably my favorite song on the album is the most unique song I've heard in a while... Here you have a damn good bass line running the whole lenth of the song, with no electric guitar, and then half way through horns come in and break off into total chaos, all the while the song keeps the same constant bass line... oh, and all the way through you have electronic sounds fluttering around the bass line seamlessly... it's just pure genious in my opinion... then the album has more traditional rock songs like Optomistic, and How to Disappear Completely, but even these songs are tinged with electronica, and odd melodies or time signatures... I just love the mixture of so many styles of electronica, with traditional rock music... the ideas that are presented, such as using edited and altered vocal parts as different tracks on the song Everything in its Right Place, to the idea of using the vocal as an additional &quot;instrument&quot; in the ambient song Kid A, to the straight ambience of treefingers ( which is really just like a good book, it sparks the imagination and takes you away), and finally to the chaotic use of horns in NAtional Anthem... I consider this one of the most unique, and refreshing records ever released... obviously it borrows aspects from other music, but it joins so many things together that it is definately not like anything else ever released... It covers so many styles of music that that alone is enough reason for it to be consider genious, but that along with the fact that it sold well just proves the point... as one person said, Nirvanas Nevermind sounded just like the Pixies, but because Nevermind sold more it's considered genious... and rightfully so, it pushed the type of music forward, and really it is the reason for the beginnings of grunge and alternative... similar to that, Kid A has pushed electronica music to the forefront, and deserves some respect because of this, but along with this Kid A has moved the genre along, and has melded many different styles creating a new hybrid... if anyone can't appreciate the genius that is Kid A, well I don't know what to say but go back to your Backstreet Boys, and Britiney Spears, because Kid A is just above you...
0679746048|5.0|I don't think I've read any book that is as realistic as &quot;Girl Interrupted.&quot; When I first bought the book I thought I was in for a regular non-fiction story.  I was wrong.  Rather than just being a true life story about Susanna Kaysen in a hospital, it showed more of what it was like to be in a mental institute and what fears, friends, and encounters you may come upon. Before reading this book be prepared for a very honest and intriguing lifestyle of a patient who is diagnosed with &quot;borderline personality.&quot;  Susanna will give you a close perspective of the interesting patients and disturbing stories they carry.
B00005B36H|5.0|It's been a long wait...5 years since Ænema came out.  I've been a Tool fan since the first CD, Opiate, and I have to say that this one is the best.  I have seen a few reviews here that proclaim it's not as good as Ænema, but they're wrong.  It highly surpasses it.  <br />&quot;Lateralus&quot;, which I believe is Latin for &quot;to the side&quot;, combines all the aspects of any good metal CD.  It retains the softness of some of the Ænema tracks, but it also is alot heavier than anything they've ever put out.  Some of the softer tracks are &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Schism&quot;, but it also has ultra-hard tracks, such as &quot;Parabola&quot; and &quot;Ticks And Leeches&quot;.  I like the fact that Tool's gotten a little heavier on this record, while still retaining the intelligent and thought provoking songs that made Ænema a such a succes.  Congratulations, Tool, you've done it again.
B00005B36H|5.0|this album is amazing!!! To even say it is weaker than Aenima goes to show how some people really just don't know good music anymore.  The fact that as I write this review this album is below 5 stars truly angers me.  If someone could do me a favor and name one bad song on the album please do.  From track 1 to  track 13 the music evolves throughout and amazes me.  It really makes me wonder how these guys ever do it. Well anyway TOOL rules and everyone should have everything they ever put out.  That is if you appreciate intelligent and good music.  They are the most innovative band out there right now and the best song writers.  TOOL will rock on in everyones mind forever.
B00005B36H|5.0|Look at the music industry today a lot of music today is recycled. Tool's music is not complicated and recycled. It is simple. This music is so much creative I have seen only Pink Floyd and Radihead make such creative music.  I never get tired of their music.  Tool's music is worth every cent you spend.
B00000099Y|5.0|this album is very moving emotionally and is just good music.  Whoever doesn't understand that doesn't understand good music. The new album is actually better, but this is still an amazing album that deserves 5 stars just like any other TOOL album.
B00005B36H|5.0|this cd is awesome. it skifully mixes heaviness with mellowness. this is their second best cd only behind the awesome undertow. there is alot of deversity on this record. you have heavy tracks like &quot;ticks and leeches&quot; and &quot;parabola&quot; and mellow songs like    &quot;parabol&quot; and &quot;reflection&quot;. Best tracks are &quot;the patient&quot;,&quot;schism&quot;,&quot;ticks and leeches&quot; and &quot;lateralis&quot;
B00005B36H|3.0|Good record, just doesn't compare to Aenima.  I recently rated this record in an ecstatic way and i was really wrong about giving it 5 stars and it is nowhere near as good as the previous record.  Still good though and worth purchasing if you are a fan.
B000056K04|4.0|Bought the cd on the day it was released, listened to it, then went to a party with my friends where we discussed DMB's latest endeavor. This album is extremely different from previous releases-Dave plays electric guitar for the first time, Tim Reynolds is absent, and Steve Lillywhite has been replaced by producer Glen Ballard. Carlos Santana and Santana percussionist Karl Perazzo guest spot on &quot;Mother Father&quot;. This is DMB's first real movement into electric territory, and feedback from my friends is against this movement. I'm reminded of when Bob Dylan first went electric and was shunned by the folk community, but now everyone realizes that some of Dylan's best stuff came from that time. Hopefully, in time people will realize that DMB's musical diversity is illustrated on this album and that a talented group can create music as varied as DMB has.
6305776326|1.0|This movie is OK for kids who like stupid humor, but personally, it was really bad. It's like a 1 1/2 hour Saturday night live skit~They're great when they're only 5 mins. or whatever, but this movie is horrible. You might like it if you enjoyed Night at the Roxburry however
B000002V0Q|4.0|When Megadeth get their act together ( no drug relapses and no internal friction amongst band members ) they demonstrate what a truly great band they are. This album features the second outing of what was, and probably will always be, the most impressive Megadeth line-up; in Mustaine, Ellefson, Friedman and Menza they had a myriad of creative possibilities. These four members complemented each other perfectly and the formula has earned them &quot;superstardom&quot; status. It really is a great shame that Menza and Friedman parted company, although Megadeth still continue to make good music without them.<br />The great masses continue to harp on about &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; - Menza and Friedman's debut - as Megadeth's crowning glory but &quot;Countdown&quot; , I feel, offers more variety. Additionally, I believe the musicianship is better here; the solos, in spite of being shorter, are more fluent and lyrically the band moved up a notch. However, I remain undecided as to which album is better as a whole, as &quot;Countdown&quot; isn't without flaw : The song &quot;Captive Honour&quot; falls way short of the mark and Mustaine's vocals at the beginning of the song are poor ( admitedly, he's no Paul Rodgers! ) The chourus on the song &quot;Psychotron&quot; is nothing other than soporific.<br />That said, the album is very strong in every department and Marty Friedman's solos are spellbinding. Definitely worth investigating.
B000000OUE|5.0|What more do i Have to say. This cd is awesome. the best songs are More Human than Human and Blood Silk and Milk.Rob should get back together.
068817776X|4.0|The Nazi Officer's Wife tells the story of how the author, a Jewish Austrian, survived the Holocaust, not in a concentration camp or while hiding out in a basement, but while living &quot;openly&quot; in Nazi Germany. She managed to do so by adopting the identity of an Aryan woman, working as a nurse for the Red Cross, and even marrying a man who would become an officer in the Nazi army. Other members of her family, meanwhile, were deported to concentration camps and eventually killed.<br />This is a stark and disturbing story told simply and without adornment. Definitely not a &quot;feel-good&quot; book, it tells honestly of the horrors of life for Jews in Europe during the Third Reich. Nevertheless, it ultimately is an uplifting story of survival and serves as a useful reminder of how cruel mankind can be when racial hatred is not only tolerated but celebrated.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Great acting(even Arni), great sound and a great movie. Cameron seems to be only good 'sequal' director. The 'Almost' in the title is because of; I think the best picture quality is &quot;The perfect storm'. The sound is great, only the same day I watched this DVD, I also watched 'The Rock: The criterion edition'. And that DTS soundtrack will make your neighbours move........ But really. It is absolutely a great DVD. I rate it five stars, because 4,5 is not possible and 4 is not enough
B00005AUBA|5.0|&quot;Rock Action&quot; picks up where &quot;Come On Die Young&quot; and &quot;EP+2&quot; left off.  And for those of you wondering, yes there are indeed more vocals on this album than the last.  But this isn't a bad thing. Repeat: this isn't bad.  If anything, the largest improvement over previous efforts is the lush arrangement of the album.  Gone is the sparse and sometimes dry formula of the past and thrown together are organs, strings, synthesizers, and get this, banjos.  Don't panic quite yet.  Rock Action arguably boasts three of the most lush, soaring, ethereal, and best Mogwai songs recorded yet.  The first of these is the opening track, &quot;Sine Wave&quot;.  It's a relatively quiet number with sparse drums, hypnotizing subtle guitar lines and popcorn like synthesizer bleeps that run around and through every speaker, reminiscent of some Trent Reznor bad dream.  When it's all said and done &quot;Sine Wave&quot; is a cautious, beautiful opener that sets the sharply defined tone for the album.  Number two of the Rock Action power trilogy is &quot;You Don't Know Jesus&quot;.  I never thought I knew him, but Mogwai seems to think so.  In more of a traditional sense, &quot;You Don't Know Jesus&quot; is the most comfortable track on the album.  Long, ominous, and saddening, it's a track that reminds us who we're listening to, just in case anyone forgets.  And finally, there is &quot;2 Rights Make 1 Wrong&quot;.  You'll immediately refer to this song as &quot;the one with the banjo&quot;.  Perhaps the most poignant comparison to make would be with the opening track of Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven&quot;.  Both tracks are, gasp, uplifting epics that actually make the listener feel good rather than casually deliver the token post rock melancholic disposition.  The other tracks on Rock Action aren't exactly weak either.  Gruff Rhys, frontman of the Welsh supergroup Super Furry Animals, lends his voice to &quot;Dial: Revenge&quot; and the result is a particularly haunting piece, nicely equipped with a tragic acoustic guitar and vocals sung entirely in Welsh.  Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Rock Action is its length, a tart 38 minutes.  When the album ends, unfortunately with the weakest song on the album, &quot;Secret Pint&quot;, perhaps the most appropriate response would be a sigh of relief.  They've added more instruments and they've added more voices.  Nevertheless, Mogwai has done it.  They've made an album that survives their own musical evolution.
B000059TPN|5.0|This DTS track 'Rocks..............'
B000002L61|5.0|There really isn't too much more to say.  Everything that we wanted to hear on &quot;Holy Diver&quot; has been given on the second Dio release, &quot;Last in Line.&quot;  The band's playing blends perfectly into a mighty metal factory that cranks out masterpieces more often than Axl Rose buys tattoos.  &quot;We Rock&quot; kicks off the album with a bruising, supersonic assault that shows off Vinny Appice's talent for drumming.  The title track is superb, with every member of the band contributing his heart and soul.  Other standout songs include &quot;One Night in the City,&quot; &quot;Mystery,&quot; &quot;Evil Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Egypt (The Chains Are On).&quot;<br />Throughout the album, Ronnie's great vocals snake through the warp of Vivian Campbell's soulful guitars and the weft of Jimmy Bain's strumming bass to join with Vinny's stitching of drums to weave an incredible fabric that has not only endured almost twenty years of stardom, but is also considered one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  Fans of classic metal will never forget that both &quot;Holy Diver&quot; and &quot;Last in Line&quot; helped spawn the Golden Years of heavy metal.
B00005B36H|3.0|I eagerly awaited this release as did many reviewers here. I consider myself a very true Tool fan, but they have fallen well short of what they are capable of. It seems that Maynard has incorporated his slow paced melodic format from his Perfect Circle project into the new release. The music is very good when it actually arrives, it just takes too long to begin. I found myself fast forwarding the tracks like I never have done on a Tool CD before. Maybe it will grow on me like other CDs have but I am disappointed none the less. It seems that all bands nowadays get their notariety from being hardcore in their first releases, but fall short in their later works when their music becomes slower and softer. I hope this isnt the case in future releases with Tool.
B00005ARDC|5.0|The reviewers who cite the influences on B.R.M.C. are absolutely correct - the band sounds like a combination of other artists and bands that came before it. So dock it for originality, if you will.<br />The only thing to keep in mind is that about one percent or less of pop and rock music released these days is truly original. Virtually everything is derivative of something or someone.<br />Anyone who fails to buy this CD will be missing out on one of the best new albums of the year. They do derive heavily from others who came before, but they do it in such an incredibly wonderful, inspiring way, and the band creates its own unique sound. The melodies on this CD are just lovely.  From the opening hooks of &quot;Love Burns&quot; until the last note is played, B.R.M.C. spins unforgettable song after song. While we're talking about influences, be sure to check out the George Harrison/&quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;-esque &quot;Too Real&quot;, just a fantastic track.<br />I strongly recommend this album.
B000002KDO|5.0|That is how Master of Reality begins, with the famous repetitive cough of &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;.  On this 1971 release, Sabbath's third album, the band has become &quot;masters&quot; of their own sound.  Calling Black Sabbath influential is an understatement. Listen to any of their first 4 albums and you can hear where several &quot;metal&quot; bands got their riffs, style, and &quot;dark&quot; image.  Actually, the silliest idea about Black Sabbath is that they are all satan worshippers obsessed with death and think that everyone should commit suicide.  Anyone who ever thought these things about this group should try reading the words that Ozzy Osbourne is singing.  Their not evil words and a prime example is on Master of Reality.  For example, in &quot;After Forever&quot; is clearly about finding God - &quot;They should realize that God is the only way to love.&quot; and &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; (No it's not about little kids rising from their graves and killing people) is about a generation of young people who are tired of the hate filled world they live in and want to change it at any cost - &quot;They'll fight the world until they've won and love comes flowing through.&quot;  Tony Iommi has stated that much of the dark and demonic image associated with Sabbath can be chalked up to record company ploys to make money by making the band seem &quot;evil&quot; (For example, the inner sleeve of the debut LP, Black Sabbath (1970), contains an upside down cross which was not the band's idea at all).  If you look at all 8 of the original line up's album covers, there is not an evil or disturbing image in the bunch, with the minor exception of the hooded figure on the debut cover which could be considered creepy by some.  I grew up thinking negative things about Black Sabbath but I'm so glad I grew up and gave this pioneering band a chance because they created some very important music and if anything was ever called &quot;heavy metal&quot; it should be Black Sabbath even though they were creating these sounds before that term existed.  Master of Reality is perhaps the statement that solidified the Black Sabbath sound, it is essential.  One last question to those who think Ozzy Osbourne is &quot;evil&quot; - What hand gesture does he always give, particularly on the cover of Black Sabbath, Vol. 4? - The peace sign.  Yes, maybe he is pure evil.
B00005BL2A|2.0|I have loved DM since 1987. I even met my wife at a DM-only club, long time ago. So I'm pretty much a sucker for any DM material - from official releases to bootlegs. Before buying the album, I saw the names of the tracks and they seemed eerily familiar, like paraphrases of other famous DM tracks. I thought this is a sign of rehashed songs and harmonies (just like &quot;Dream On&quot; sounds a bit too much like the acoustic version of &quot;PJ&quot;). But I wasn't prepared for being so wrong.<br />The album is bad. Not since &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; have I heard something as bad. Let me explain something here. Unlike for other reviewers, English is not my first language. So I listen to the music and the voice first - the way they are supposed to blend means more than the verses. It might seem bizarre at first, but consider this: DM has a huge following in Germany, as well as many other European countries - especially Eastern Europe. Did you ever believe it was the words? We don't follow the words as closely as English speakers do, music is more important than you'd think. That's why Europeans loved DM, steadily, even when Americans laughed at them, and the Brits turned their backs - another proof that &quot;nobody's a prophet in his own country&quot;.<br />So what's going on with &quot;Exciter&quot;? I must admit, Dave's voice never sounded so good. But that's about it. There is no memorable hit on the album. Every album until now had at least ONE major hit - think about &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Strangelove&quot;, &quot;People Are People&quot; - instantly recognizable songs, with an unmistakable DM sound to them, yet each of them original. Even &quot;SOFAD&quot; had this quality.<br />&quot;Exciter&quot; has none of all this. What you get instead is a very loud (mostly in the second half) album, with tunes you are guaranteed to forget as soon as they're over. And regardless of what the official Amazon review says, &quot;Dead of Night&quot; is simply atrocious. <br />There are three or four tracks on the album (especially the last) that are slightly better, but all in all, this is definitely an experiment - most songs seem unfinished, with a simple fade at the end. And the instruments are too loud, with a &quot;zing&quot;-ing quality that seems to be a trademark for contemporary albums - no doubt, it's Bjork's producer's hand. But DM is DM, it can't be Nine Inch Nails or Massive Attack!<br />After five years of hiatus (if we exclude &quot;Only When I Lose Myself&quot; and its B-sides), there is no excuse for DM to come out with something like this. Perhaps they're searching for a new identity? I sure hope they're still looking. After all, any great band needs a change every now and then. R.E.M. did the same thing with &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot;, or U2 with &quot;Pop&quot;. Both were flops, frankly. I can understand that. After all, how many times can you sing &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; or compose songs in the similar vein? The lack of radio hits or commercial success aren't even the point here - you can have a pefect gem that remains overlooked in a world of Britney Spears clones.<br />I hope the band will get back on track. But in the long run, this will be the weakest link in the DM chain.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is a disc that is sure to please anyone. First off, you have the wonderful movie that still holds up after all this time, and whether it's the first time you see it or the hundredth, it is still every bit as enjoyable. Superman: The Movie is well acted and well scripted, and simply holds up as one of the most exciting movies of our time. Christopher Reeve was never better than when he was wearing the red, yellow, and blue, and of all four Superman movies, he shined the brightest in the first one.<br />But this DVD is not just about the terrific film it represents. Warner has produced a disc that belongs in every DVD lover's collection. The excellent picture and the astounding audio are just the start. That alone would have made this disc one to crow about, but the extensive supplemental material that was put together, all the behind the scenes extras and the insightful commentary... well I cannot recommend this disc highly enough, so do yourself a favor and pick up Superman: The Movie on DVD. You won't be disappointed.
B00005B36H|5.0|well some say this isnt the same as the old tool, but who wants to dwell in the past? This band takes you through loving guitar riffs to angered double bass to hypnotic words. When I close my eyes, I found myself lost in the mesh of things to come. All together this is a cd for the ones who really appreciate what bands have forgotten and lost, which is talent. Lateralus may just be the beginning of a new music era with this awesome display of what they like to do. Go pick up a copy of this album and I promise that you will be bobbin your head and movin your body with this trip.
B00003CXRM|4.0|When I saw this movie I wasn't blown away. As the weeks passed, I found myself remembering funny lines and scenes.  I would laugh out loud at some of them &quot;We're in a tight spot!&quot; or &quot;My hair.&quot; This is  a great movie.  Just thinking back on it makes me smile.  The soundtrack is amazing as is the cinematography.  If you like the Cohen brother's ideas and work, you will not be disappointed. Them guys is great.
0802713319|2.0|Simon Singh sets out to convey the drama, excitement and genuine suspense surrounding the solving of one of the greatest problems in math - the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Singh's challenge is in both conveying the historical significance of the problem, and in boiling down complex math for those, like me, who are not particularly knowledgeable in math.   Sadly, Singh fails in both counts.  FERMAT'S ENIGMA moves slowly through the history of number theory, while leaving the meaning math's meaning impregnable.  Although this book is short, after a while I was wondering what the use was in going on.  I suspect that those who know more about math than I could enjoy this book.  Sadly, I could not - it was just over my head.
630463949X|5.0|That's simply unbelievable! I'm definitely not a fan of Fleetwood Mac and you would be ashamed of me if I told you that the only 2 songs of Fleetwood Mac I liked before were &quot;Everywhere&quot; and &quot;The Seven Wonders&quot;, the latter being not on the DVD.<br />That said, I was really intrigued by the other reviews and, baffled, I decided to give it a chance. Ooooh, I wish I had more inspirations like this one!!!<br />In this concert, shot in the premises of Warner Bros Studios, the band reunited to give the audience the best, the *very* best of themselves, humanly speaking. The old songs are all performed in a new version, giving them an emotional power they didn't have before. Fleetwood Mac also plays stupendous unpublished works, including instrumentals and brand-new songs, which proves that Fleetwood Mac is as sparkling as in the past and, in my opinion, even more sparkling than ever!<br />Look at Mick Fleetwood! Yeh... look at him! Have you ever seen an old timer like him playing the drums with so much pleasure, conviction and dexterity? I bet that from the very first song (&quot;The Chain&quot;), you'll know what I mean. <br />Lindsey Buckingham is really impressive. He plays several guitars and even the banjo in the concert and it's a delight to watch him juggling with the notes. You'll be very likely amazed by his solo performance in &quot;Big Love&quot; and &quot;Go insane&quot;.<br />And especially, don't watch the grand finale of &quot;I'm so afraid&quot; with a friend at home. If he falls on the terrific instrumental duet between Mick and Lindsey, his first idea might well be to get the hell out of your house with your DVD in the pocket!!<br />As for Stevie Nicks, she still has her angel voice. She's very convincing when she sings, because her tone and pitch always match the lyrics but never in an exaggerated way. You'll also notice that she dances like a bird flies, it's so light and aerial. You'll also appreciate Stevie's cheerfulness. When shetalks to the public, she sounds so happy to see you there that you really sympathize with her feelings. Why, it makes you feel good!!<br />I read some reviews saying that Christine Mc Vie had lost the magic of her voice after all these years. Maybe. But I don't care. It is perhaps a pitch lower but she knows how to master it and that's why Christine and her voice will seduce you a long time yet. Just listen to her version of Everywhere: isn't that cute?<br />Her ex-husband John, because he plays the bass, stays more in the background. That said, he's a great support for Lindsey and shows his great sense of humour when Christine tries to force him to sing with the whole band in &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;.<br />The songs are all absolute gems. Yet you may have difficulties to tackle &quot;My Little Demon&quot;, because the tune and the words are weird! I learnt to like it and understand it (a lot of Lindsey's songs have a context related to his life) and I no longer skip it now. Expect a surprise at the end of the concert and don't forget to savour the conclusion song, offered by Christine. You'll be so upset that you'll be mad at them for leaving so soon.<br />The quality of the DVD is excellent! The sound, Dolby 5.1 or PCM Stereo, is perfect. The picture is clear and flawless. My God, how did they do that?!<br />You want to be forgiven by your wife? Offer her this DVD! You want to be spoilt by your granny? Ask her this DVD!<br />Whatever the way you'll get it, watch it in the evening. &quot;It's going to be a special night for us&quot;, Stevie Nicks said. For you too.

B00005B36H|5.0|Well some say it isnt the same as the old tool, but who wants to dwell in the past? This cd goes through signifigant emotional changes from double bassed anger to loving guitar riffs to hypnotizing words. This may be the beginning of a new era of music with this cd, because their talent is overwhelmingly addicting. They took they're time putting this together, cause you find yourself lost in the music when you close your eyes. If you are looking for something new and intrigueing, Pick up the laterus cd, and I promise you'll find yourself bobbin your head
6305090564|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie -- loved the interaction between Treat Williams and Kevin J O'Connor [hope their names are right] their humor and friendship -- ending left me wanting a follow up movie -- loved the big MoJo -- can't count the number of times I have watched it again and again etc.
B00005B36H|1.0|Tool's return has not been worth the wait.  This CD is just plain self-indulgent.  And when it's not self-indulgent, it's just flat out boring.  <br />Does Maynard really think that anyone wants to listen to a three minute, static-filled phone call, where someone is reporting an alien siting to the authorities?  Please... there are just too many bands, putting out music that is far superior to Lateralus, to make this CD worth purchasing..
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This film/musical is a must see!  It is visually incredible..I was literally trembling when I left the theater (I have just seen it in New York).  It has great romance, drama, comedy and fantastic music!  See it with an open mind...modern music in a &quot;period&quot; movie may be a bit anachronistic, but this movie grabs you and goes beyond.  It was thoroughly enjoyable, unique, and fun!
B0000584V3|5.0|I have been waiting nearly twenty years for a band like this to come around.  These guys give me the same feeling Metallica did when I picked up Ride the Lightning in '84.  They have that &quot;knack&quot; (songwriting, musicianship and that added x ingredient that everyone tries to find).  Everyone of their five albums are excellent in their own unique way.  Please do yourself a favor and buy this or any Opeth album and listen to it over and over and over again.  With each listen of their albums you find new things and little nuances which will just blow you away.  If you are one of those people who need comparisons than I'll say this.  Any fan of the following bands must check these guys out.  (mid/late 80's Metallica, Dream Theater, 70's progressive bands, Iron Maiden, and Slayer)  JUST BUY SOME OPETH!!!!   Stop worrying about the small amount of money it will cost you and buy this album to introduce yourself to an awesome band.  If you don't find something enjoyable on here than I suggest you go to your family doctor for a check-up!?!?!  ENJOY.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Moulin Rouge is the type of movie you may need to see more than once. It's not that it's a complicated story  - in fact, it's so wispy as to almost be blown away by the rush (and I do mean rush) of visual spectacles.  By the time the shock of the lightning-paced blur wears off, the movie is half over -- and by then it starts to slow down its visually madcap pace. No kidding, I can picture people wanting to go to this movie in an altered state -- the way my dorm pals did at midnight screenings when I was in college. The swirling, almost non-stop visual kaleidoscope starts almost at minute one and doesn't let up for a full hour. Really, most of the movie dances by in a blur. While many in the audience chuckled in recognition of the familiar (mostly) pop tunes, the songs were expertly arranged, orchestrated and staged. Ewan McGregor really shines -- and can really sing! Jim Broadbent, a terrific English character actor, is unbelievable (sort of a new-millenium PT Barnum perhaps?). He has one number in particular... but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.  (Let's just say that I'll never think about a certain Madonna song in the same way again.)  I'm not exactly sure what Baz Luhrmann was thinking while directing John Leguizamo as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec (maybe by way of The Time Bandits and Monty Python?) but I'm not exactly sure it matters. Nicole Kidman has a perfectly OK, if thin, voice that I'm sure was majorly boosted in post production (and/or the recording studio) but she's not bad -- she just technically doesn't have a lot to work with. If you've seen and liked Strictly Ballroom, just think of the version Baz might have created on acid -- and you still won't come close to the audio and visual roller-coaster that is Moulin Rouge. You may love it. You may hate it. But you should certainly dance off and see it.
B00000F1D3|3.0|I bought this on a whim a few years ago, as I had some friends who owned it and said it was really danceable.  I needed some new music, so I bought it and listened to it.  I have very mixed feelings about this album.  I can easily skip through the title track, as I have heard that song one too many times in my life.  The Power is also a waste of space on the album.  Strong Enough, however, is phenomenal and catchy as hell.  After hearing it one or two times I was singing it everywhere.  All Or Nothing is yet another powerful track.  Taxi Taxi is pretty good as well.  Why they included We All Sleep Alone (even if it is a dance version) again is beyond me.  There are only 10 songs on this album (and only 9 new ones), and the voice enhancing gets carried away in some of these songs.  This album definately isn't going to be around forever, but it did give people some perks while it was out.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has upped the ante on this album.  It is no longer the intelligent angst of Opiate and parts of Undertow (I say intelligent because Limp Bizkit is unintelligent angst, it's important to know the difference).  It is no longer the minor stab into the occult, into ideas, into sound scapes that Aenima was.  Lateralus has the influence of high electronic music.  Maynard has said he listens to Autechre often, and their influence shows.  The songs are harder to listen to at first, like the Rolling Stone review said, but it demands three listenings initially at least.  Then it owns you.  Tool have matured over five years and they think we have too.  The music is stronger, more fierce and soft all at once.  The range is greater and the ideas are better than those presented on previous albums.
B00005BL2A|5.0|After an excellent work such as 'Ultra' this was the least I could expect from the band. My first impressions about the album were very positive.<br /> In order to contrast it with the previous album, it has to be said that this one, except for a couple of songs, sounds like a more quiet and perhaps mature Depeche.<br /> I'm definitely going to miss being able to see them when they come to town... but I'm not gonna be around! :(
B000000W9Z|5.0|This album is probably the best of Bowie's more recent albums. Many of the songs can be descibed as nothing other than incredible: for example, 'Outside', 'Thru these Architects Eyes', and the beautiful'The Motel'.   Mike Garson is a genius, and really helps to make the album what it is. The whole team of musicians here create a fantastic album. The fact that the album is a work of sheer musical genius overides the annoying segues that you just skip through. Buy this album, it is a classic.
B000002H97|5.0|This is one of Metallica's best known works.  Nicknamed the Black Album because of it's cover and booklet, it produced some really good songs.  Like many reviewers have said, it is much more mainstream than earlier songs, but it's still heavy enough to be considered Metallica.  The opening track, Enter Sandman, is great.  It's freaky, scary, eerie and more.  Think of it as a harder version of Michael Jackson's Thriller.  Another great song on here is Nothing Else Matters, which is Metallica's major ballad hit.  It is really good!  I personally agree with the music fan from Detroit that music doesn't have to be gloomy and morbid for people to enjoy it.  I think this is better than anything else Metallica has done, and it's probably their least morbid album.  If you like harder rock, this is the perfect album for you.  It is awesome.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourites. No other band that I've heard have been able to top this aside from Iron Maiden. I bought this a couple of years back and then lost it. I didn't listen to it much so I wasn't too bothered. But a couple of months ago a mate of mine mentioned it to me and told me where I could get it cheap, so thinking that I might as well buy it if it was going cheap I went a got it. And I had COMPLETELY forgotton how brilliant it was. Every riff, melody, lead; every song came flooding back. I couldn't believe that I could possibly have lost interest in this album.<br />From Welcome To The Jungle to Rocket Queen there are NO fillers, no bad moments - just pure adrenaline rock and roll with SO much energy. Some songs such as Night Train, and I Think About You have a very emotional ending while Out Ta Get Me and Mr Brownstone are just great fun. Paradise City, Sweet Child Of Mine and Its So Easy are really good as well.<br />Most so-called classic albums don't deserve their status (Nirvana's Nevermind being a prime example). This however, deserves every second of it, and more. You gotta be crazy not to like this album at least little bit - I usually listen to metal and I'm not a big fan of rock (I never thought much of Van Halen, Kiss or Judas Priest). But this is just amazing - stop reading and just go buy it!!
B000002BUY|5.0|This cd shows that even out of the world of these no-talent bands that have one hit and die out, some praise worthy bands actually do exist. Every song on S.C.I.E.N.C.E is completely unique, and you will find yourself humming every single number for hours. Redefine, Vitamin, Idiot Box, A Certain Shade of Green, My Favorite Things, and Calgone. Redefine shows that Incubis can just be incredible when it comes to mixing things up with the turn tables. Vitamin has a very catchy chorus, and some interesting lyrics to boot. Idiot Box is a lot like Vitamin but with a little more feeling. A Certain Shade of Green is an incredible song that has ringing in my head since I bought the C.D. My Favorite Things is still a hardcore song, but it really shows off the lead singer's vocal ability. And Calgone is just an interesting mesh of catchy tunes and lyrics which makes it very hard to get sick of.     If your sick of this explosion of pop culture bands which sound exactly alike, I strongly suggest that you add iNcUbUs'S &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot;
B000002AS3|5.0|There was a band called Oasis, and they released a CD called &quot;definitly maybe&quot; and they changed the world and ..... by far and away, Columbia is the best song ever from Oasis, just second by Gas Panic (from their newer 2000 ablum)
B000002UEB|5.0|lthough I've already reviewed this, I wanted to re-review it because I felt the last one didn't do it justice. This is album is quite possibly the best I've ever heard. Queensryche must have known when they were making this that they would never reach this height again. Anybody who has heard this album time and time again will know what I mean. Every moment - every note played, every word sung, every drum hit is just perfect.<br />Goeff Tate's voice is one of the best there is. He hits high notes with such passion and emotion that you feel it inside. Michael Wilton and Chris DeGarmo may not be the most technical of guitarists, but they play leads with extreme care and caution and they write some amazing music on this album. Eddie Jackson is a very solid bass player and has a promenent style that doesn't just follow the guitars and Scott Rockenfield is a great drummer.<br />The album is also telling a story. The main character is Nikki, who is a nobody. He gets picked up by a mad Doctor called Dr X who uses people to plan a revolution and murder Senators and hooks them on drugs. Nikki also meets Mary, who he falls in love with. I'll leave the rest for you. The story is kind of a downward spiral, and especially near the end of the album it is very emotional. What's even better is that once you know the story and what part of it the different songs are telling, images fill your head when you're listening as if I if you were imagining it as a film. No other album does that to me.<br />All in all there are no fillers - every song stands out. My particular favourites are Revolution Calling with an excellent chorus, Electric Requiem and Breaking The Silence for the emotion, and the closer Eyes Of A Stranger which is one of the best album closers I've ever heard. But like I said, all the songs rock. One reviewer even went as far as to say that &quot;there is only one song - it just changes pace and tone&quot;.<br />Although its brilliance may not be immediately apparent, it will not take long for you to recognise how good it is. I cannot recommend it enough, and I can honestly say that it is the best album in my collection. If I was stuck on a desert island with only one CD, it would be this.will not take long for you to recognise how good it is.

B00005BL2A|3.0|Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he called Exciter 'Disappointer'. This album sounds too much like Martin Gore's solo effort, Counterfeit E.P. Too slow and too experimental. Releasing 'Dream On' as the single was a good idea because they will sell a lot of copies based solely on that song alone. Too bad only the most die-hard DM fans will appreciate the rest of the album. I personally thought Ultra was excellent - this pales in comparision. I never thought I'd say this, but even Songs of Faith and Devotion was better than this one. I consider myself a true DM fan, so I am giving it 3 stars, but if it wasn't DM, this album would truly deserve only 1 or 2 stars...
6305909326|1.0|I am a big fan of Roman Polanski.  Even his more subtle horror films (The Tenant, Rosemary's Baby) were intriguing and well worth watching.  But this lemon is not redeemable in any way shape or form.  What was the purpose of the differences in the manuscripts that were literally shoved in our faces throughout the entire film?  Why all the murders?  Why did these people do what they were doing?  Don't just throw stuff in our faces without any reason why.  It was a terrific waste of an evening and take heed:  stay away from this lousy film
B00005BL2A|1.0|I could not believe this was the band that released Violator, Music for the Masses and Black Celebration. Whatever magic they once had is gone.<br />I was praying for them to bounce back from Ultra, (Every band is allowed one poor album but they have slid even further into an abyss of unfresh ideas. This band has lost its steam and has gone from cutting-edge New Wave to a single notce above New Age. I am just waiting for their team-up with John Tesh at Christmas Time.<br />Seriously, this album is nothing more than 3 guys with a drum machine. And what really hurt here, I really wanted to like this album. I tried and tried to get into it. It was to no avail, however.<br />I long for their old stuff.
B000002UAX|5.0|When this album first hit the racks in 1968, early reviews were not kind. Critics were shocked. This record ( do you remember records? ) appeared disjointed and was considered way too long for that time. Of course in retrospect this work has gained legendary status. All the Beatles' influences came together at one time and in one place in this. McCartney's melodicism, Lennon's brilliance and sometimes eccentricities, and Harrison finally showing that he was a force that should be taken very seriously, throw in Eric Clapton's wonderful guitar work on While my Guitar Gently Weeps; and you have one of the finest musical statements ever made. Not always a cohesive unit on this, the Beatles gave most of the tracks the feel of a solo album. But, in no way does this seem to detract from it. I guess only the Beatles could have pulled this one off. This is truly a listening experience like no other.
B000002MFQ|5.0|Try playing this cd while you're driving and outside it's raining: you'll not be disappointed. I adored TB1 right from the very first time I listened to it on the radio, but I love TB2 even more.<br /><br />  \\"Sentinel\\", \\"Weightless\\" and \\"The great plain\\" are my favourites themes.
B00005BL2A|5.0|With their latest work, Depeche once again takes their music to new and slightly unexpected places.  The eleven songs and two instrumental interludes in this album are ethereal, a tad soporific (with one obvious exception), and hypnotic.  It would be the perfect soundtrack to a post-apocolyptic love story.<br />After the first few times I heard the album, what struck me most is that it has more mature sound about it than any of their previous work - perhaps not too surprising, given that the members of Depeche have passed 40 and are raising pre-teens now.  I recall reading an interview of Gore several months ago in which he stated that he was finding it difficult to write &quot;fast&quot; songs as he ages, and you can really hear it in the album.  With the possible exception of &quot;Dream On&quot;, nothing is particularly catchy, but all of it somehow pulls you in.<br />In contrast to what some of the other reviewers have written, I have found the lyrics to be far better than ever before.  I absolutely adore all of their past work, but honestly, try reciting 'People are People' to an uninitiated friend sometime...  This album, in contrast, approaches poetic.<br />If you are a Depeche fan, and don't like what you hear at first, recall listening to Songs of Faith and Devotion for the first time when the world was expecting Violator II.  If you don't like the album on the first listen, you probably will by the fourth.<br />Depeche Mode has already made history - among followers of electronic music, they are widely regarding as founding fathers.  This album illustrates that Depeche continue to practice true musical vision with their tenth album and after twenty years.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|An incredible, immersive, mind blowing trip with killer music and Nicole Kidman to boot.
6305524866|5.0|Four Weddings &amp; A Funeral was a hilarious film about dealing with the absurdity of attending these functions.  Hugh Grant is adorable as a typical bumbling Englishman while Andie McDowell was wonderful as the beguiling American who sweeps Hugh off of his feet.  I could relate to many of the goings on at the  weddings.  Unfortunately I empathized with the character of Scarlett who had trouble getting the blokes that she liked but was not interested in the blokes that liked her!  All in all, a lot of fun to watch.
6304806442|3.0|I really think this was probably the most graphic movie about drug use I've ever seen. To be truthful, it was kind of scary. Many times during the movie, I had to turn my head. The subject matter, in my opinion, is not that hard to come by. Somehow, we humans, are fascinated by the idea that someone could willingly throw his life away for something like heroin. <br />However, I can't help but think that the person who wrote this movie was brilliant. There are some scenes, like the toilet scene and the overdose scene, that add a perspective I've never considered before. <br />Somehow, I can't give it more than 3 stars, though. I mean, the subject matter (heroin) is a topic that sells books and movies. It's one of those extreme things that is a sort of commercial hook. I don't understand it myself, why am I sucked-in to a movie that shows someone's life being wasted away. as a parallel, why do I enjoy a bank-robbery movie? These types of movies show NO resemblance to the life I know - perhaps it is some sort of escape. It's a free ride into the world of heroin - without all the mess...<br />This movie was INTENSE! I think the BABY thing bothered me - (watch the movie - you'll see what I mean), and that's why I can't give it an excellent rating. It really does show the \\"good\\" and very bad side of drug use - which I appreciate. the balance, I mean. <br />I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under 18. From the cover, you'd think it was a movie like \\"10 things I hate about you.\\" Trust me, it isn't!
B000002J1B|3.0|At the risk of exposing myself for the diehard Yes fan that I'm not, I'll admit to some disappointment with &quot;Relayer&quot; and go so far as to rank it below the oft-criticized &quot;Union&quot;.  For me, this is one of those albums which completely succeeds in accomplishing nothing, save for a few brilliant moments here and there.  It is a very &quot;epic&quot; album, containing just three songs, one of 20 minutes and two of about 10 minutes apiece.  It opens with the largest of the three, &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot;.  Reading through the lyrics to this one, I thought I was going to really like it, but somewhere in the execution it left me very unconvinced and unaffected.  The music and vocals just didn't seem to jive with the subject matter, for me, and in truth, the only part of the song that really moved me was the &quot;Soon, oh soon...&quot; section towards the end.  This piece is followed with the eccentric &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;, which is a particularly unconventional, if enjoyable, song.  Still, it is not going to find itself among a list of my favorites from Yes (though the &quot;Cha-cha-cha's&quot; are a nice touch).  In my opinion, the album's brightest spot is in the last song &quot;To Be Over&quot;.  From its tranquil instrumental beginnings to its charming melodies (not to mention the sweet instrumental midsection), this one was the only one of the three to really get my attention, though I do wish it had a little bit more lyrical substance to it.  All in all, it's a decent album, though I'd much rather listen to &quot;The Yes Album&quot; or &quot;Fragile&quot;.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder is truely a living master. I just recently purchased CD version. I've had the LP (that's vinyl for those 20yrs old and under) one for over 25 years -- still plays well.  No true music fan should be without this work in their collection.
B000000OMB|3.0|With talent like Steve Howe and Carl Palmer aboard, and with prior knowledge of the album's more commercial leanings, I was hoping this album would demonstrate some tremendous blend of prog and pop.  From these expectations, I was a little surprised at how far flat this one fell.  The prog elements are minuscule, and, in my opinion, the song-writing is shockingly bland for a commercial album.  I was already familiar with the songs &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; (which I really liked) and &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; (which I kind of liked), but aside from giving me these two hits, the album offers little else.  Some songs have promising intros and/or verses only to be ruined with some of the worst choruses I've ever heard.  The repetition and blandness of the refrains in such songs as &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; and &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; are almost intolerably annoying, with other songs' choruses being only a little more inspiring.  The vocals are also a little too dry for my tastes.  Fortunately, a few above-average songs such as &quot;Time Again&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Feeling&quot; keep the album from completely sinking below mediocrity.  A decent album, but I was expecting so much more.
B000056K04|3.0|This is not DMBs best album.  It's not their worst.  I am only 13 years old, so maybe no one cares about my opinion, but COME ON.  &quot;I Did It&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; are great songs.  The rest of the songs on the album aren't awesome, but they're not that bad.  I would reccomend this album to anyone who likes DMB and is willing to accept a change in their music.
B000002J1F|5.0|From &quot;Roundabout's&quot; inviting intro to the emotional climax of &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot; quickly became my favorite of the Yes albums that I own to date.  &quot;Roundabout&quot; has always been a favorite of mine, and the same can be said of &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; (gotta love that intro) and &quot;Long Distance Runaround / The Fish&quot;, all of which I already had some familiarity with via &quot;Yessongs&quot; and (to an extent) radio.  Of the material on the album that was new to me, &quot;Cans and Brahms&quot; is as fulfilling a song as you're liable to find in a one and a half minute keyboard instrumental, while the eight minute piece &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; safely lives up to the standards set by the three songs I had already known and loved, mentioned above.  To top it all off, Steve Howe's guitar delights on &quot;Mood For a Day&quot;, a romantic acoustic guitar solo that I actually thought was better than &quot;The Yes Album's&quot; &quot;The Clap&quot;.  Overall, &quot;Fragile&quot; is a very dynamic and colorful album, chock full of great tracks that are just dripping with memorable melodies.  This is the most impressive Yes release I've heard yet, taking the material found on &quot;The Yes Album&quot; to the next level.
B000002U9L|5.0|The Trevor Jones music is excellent, but in my opinion, the Bowie songs alone represent the best album Bowie ever made.  I simply love the songs.  I was very excited to see this available on CD, as I still only have a cassette from when the movie first came out in theatres in the mid-80s--who knows how much longer that tape will last?  I loved that movie so much that I saw it on a Saturday, then bought the cassette soundtrack and took my grandmother to see the movie on Sunday.
B00005B36H|4.0|I got this album this first day it came out.  After the first listem i really didn't know what know what to think.  After a few listens I was blown away..by the music.  Now the lyrics ...  The past two albums (including the EP Opeiate) had great lyrics (not to say this one doesn't, if you've heard these albums before you'd know what I meant).  For now this album is completly beyond me, its' really something else.  I quite honestly, have never heard anything like it.  I like TooL beacause the songs are all open for interpretation and that's exactly what songs are all about. They  mean whatever you them want to mean.  I'm still trying to grasp the full meaning of these songs, and what they mean to me.  Tool's albums will bring out a side of you that you never thought existed.  This album is definetly a journey into the unexpected and definetly worth buying.  I also recomend Kyuss's Sky Valley and I 've recently discovered a new underground band : Dredg ...

B00005B36H|5.0|Evolution is a natural course of events (sorry to all the Creationists). Sure the riffs and soaring guitars used to be more prevalent, and seemingly every song had the potential of being &quot;radio friendly.&quot; Such is not the case with Lateralus and I applaud the intricacy and devotion. This album is made by musucuans for musicians, so the &quot;Pop Revolution&quot; crowd might not approve. However, for more discerning tastes, as well as die-hard Tool advocates, this album is guaranteed to to be a favorite.
0790729652|1.0|To make myself absolutely clear, the one star has nothing to do with the movie itself. \\"Batman\\" is such a favorite of mine, I can nearly quote the entire damned film. However, I own a perfectly good VHS copy, and I REFUSE to buy any DVD as shoddy as this.<br />No trailers? No commentary by Tim Burton or Sam Hamm? No behind-the-scenes on the making of the movie, maybe with interviews of the late, great Batman-creator Bob Kane? And I suppose they made this entire movie without any outtakes and without having to delete a single scene? Even an isolated audio track of the score (which I normally never care about) would have been Heaven.<br />....<br />When \\"Batman\\" comes out with a Criterion, 2-disk, gold-plated, limited edition, cancer-curing, multi-super-giant DVD edition that costs [price]dollars, I'll buy it in a New York minute. Hell, I'll buy two. Until then, my [price] VHS copy is enough.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I remember the days before Rolling Stone was mainstream.  It covered the newly emerging world of rock'n'roll and the stars with an upfront and personal hand...Some of the correspondents became as followable as the stars themselves.  Cameron Crowe has converted his memories of life as a 16 year old rock stringer, a career he started on a lark, (with little knowledge of the music)into a very watchable and likeable movie.  This movie leaves you trying to guess who the characters are based on in the real rock world.The cast is outstanding and true to the times.  Patrick Fugit is perfect as the wide eyed, idealistic young man( William Miller, the character Crowe based on himself), entering a world previously unknown to him.  Francis McDormond is William's mother struggling to retain some grasp on her disintergrating family (it is easy to forget how devisive rock music was within families). Phillip Seymour Hoffman, dead on as the world weary Lester Bangs, providing  Willaim Miller with entry to the rock world, while warning him of its dangers.  And luminicent, Kate Hudson as Penny Lane.  It is easy to see this as a star making role for her, she inhabits the role of a proud, ever hopeful &quot;band aid&quot; and draws your heart to her.  A wonderful look into the beginnngs of rock and roll, bringing back many , many memories.
B000002O7C|5.0|what i realy wanted was &quot;russian music&quot; just because i like it.  though the other titles that seemed to fit were unfamiliar to me. and since i was very familiar with HRO i decided that i would try it out.  great cd but the only problem is that there are no lierics for the russian songs so you have to guess what they are saying even if it is in russian.
B00005B3Z6|4.0|This DVD worked fine on my Pioneer multi zone player. This series reminded very much of the British series &quot;This Life&quot; which I thoroughly enjoyed. The main character in &quot;Queer As Folk&quot; was totally abnoxious and if he was any further up himself he would be tied up in a knot. A top cast and interesting storyline but if u are looking for full frontal in detail u will not find it here check out &quot;Beefcake&quot; and drool.......By the way the character Cameron is played by Aussie Peter O&lt;Brien who use to star in &quot;Neighbours&quot; a popular Aussie soapie.

B00005BL2A|5.0|Exciter is a masterpiece that the regular masses may not understand. By this I mean if you are expecting Black Celebration forget it.  DM and the rest of us have moved on. Although its great to reflect on the past Exiter brings a new and refreshing break that allows DM to shed those nasty fans that are just Britany Spear pop.  Exiter's mixture of synth and guitar is just what is needed in an age of pre fab stuck in the past bands and fans.  If you find Exiter to hard to swallow stop buying DM albums.
B00005B36H|2.0|First of all, I would like to resond to all of the people giving this album an excellent review.  It is by belief that these intividuals are too affraid to say what they really think about the album.  This loyalty for the band has blinded all of you to the actual quality of the album.  So to the album:  where do I begin?  When after I first heard the album I was ready to throw it on my cd tower with the other cds I no longer listen to.  But after listening to it about five times, I grew to tolerate it.  Now, I believe this album was a shameful attempt.  It sounds like the band rushed to get some music together so they could hurry up and finally release some new material.  The emphasis was not on the quality of the music, but just getting some music (and who could blame them, they couldn't have been pressured any more by the fans to finally release something).  One has to realize that it may have been about four years since their last release, but the have only been working on it for about a year.  And with Maynard busy with a perfect circle, I can't see him having much time to work on the album.  The album is way too choppy.  It does not flow well like the other three albums, and the songs are comprised of riffs identical to songs from their previous releases.  The songs are unnecissarily long, almost like they were trying to capture the epic value of the songs from Aenema.  The band was trying too hard to live up to Aenema, which is one of the only PERFECT albums to be released.  Which is why I gave it two stars.  How do you follow up an album like Aenema?  So in comparison, it probably seems worse than it is.  But Aenema gave me higher expectations for the band, and they did not come through.  So in conclusion the album is choppy, repetative, and fairly adequate.  I must say though, the song parabol/parabola is an amazing track worthy of being on Aenema.  And it is cool that Maynard is trying different effects with his voice.  But overall the album is not a gem like all of their preveous releases.  If the album was by anyone else but tool, I might actually like it a little better.  But I expected more from the band, and I regret the fact that it is, as of now, my least favorite tool release.

B00000253N|5.0|From start to finish, this album changes everything. every second of every track aches (except maybe Lilly, Rosemary...)
B00005BL2A|2.0|I was anxiously waiting for DM's new cd.  After Ultra, I figured anything would be an improvement.  I got Ultra II!  Most of the songs here are uninspiring, save for one or two.  I've been waiting 14 years for DM to make a good album, and I'll have to keep waiting.  In the meantime, it's back to listening to early 80's DM.
B00005B36H|5.0|aw, here I sit after almost a week of listening to this record repeatedly I cannot help but be slightly disappointed.  After completely consuming one of the greatest works of all time (&quot;AENIMA&quot;) for a great length of time, I was in high anticipation for this record.  I can safely say that Tool has come back and once again saved music with another masterpiece that is in its own league compared to todays music.  Nothing Tool ever released can or should be compared to what is currently going on in music.  This cd is a no question purchase.  However, alhough it has 80 minutes of material it doesnt seem as complete as AENIMA nor as inspiring.  There is definatley some world-class musicianship here, but this disc doesnt seem to really go anywhere.  With each release tool takes a major step forward  this record seems more like an &quot;undertow&quot; with a little more prog influence. It seems more like a collection of good songs than a full Conceptual work. This record has no weak points but doesnt quite flow as well as it should.  This band and record are still is in a completely different building than just about everyone else in today's music scence.  The songs are more complex and progressive than ever and maynards voice shines as always.  IF your new to Tool I would get this record first and than Untertow and Opiate.  Aenima is one of the greatest records of all time and will probably taint your appreciation for this fine record. This still is one of the best records ive heard in a while.

0618135871|5.0|Philip Roth has created brilliant bitter comedy in this extended monologue delivered by the aging, inordinately self-conscious culture critic and  anti-hero, David Kepesh.  Particularly witty is Roth's perception that Kepesh is just the sort of comic monster that our society must necessarily produce.  Our founding documents, with their imbalance in favor of the individual pursuing happiness, reduced in the 60's to a distortion in favor of the solitary soul pursuing pleasure for its own sake, give us Kepesh, here rounding out his years.  As amusing as painful is Kepesh's blindness, despite his clever self-consciousness, to the reality that the path he follows is absurdly narrow given the facts of his own experience. Not only is the sexual urge, for instance, an upsetter of his orderly, metronome-like human plans, but so is death, which occurs when it will, striking at times the young and beautiful , not just the old. Kepesh's 60's ideology is amusingly and movingly revealed as too simple to fit his own life's experiences within space, time, and inevitable decay. The comedy here is that Kepesh,for all his  consistent emphasis on individual pleasure apart from thought, is actually choking to death from too much thought, while intellectually remaining, because of his principles,  essentially clueless.  The central experiences he relates, are ones of which he, if not his readers, appears to miss the meaning.
B00005BL2A|4.0|I eagerly await each new Depeche Mode release (I dare not say 'album' for fear it will date me).  I couldn't wait to get the plastic wrapper off Exciter and have it make love to my CD player. However, even though there are standout favorites, this CD fell short of my expectations. Dave clearly does sound &quot;healthier,&quot; and Martin is brilliant as always, but Exciter will not hold the same place in my heart (and CD player) as Black Celebration, Violator, and Songs of Faith and Devotion. Far be it from me to ever bag on my Mode, but these songs smack too familiar...most have remnants of earlier songs lurking about in them.  In my opinion, best track on Exciter is &quot;Freelove,&quot; which is what Dave &amp; Co. will always get from me. See you guys later this summer at the concert!
0440211727|5.0|I read this book after being told about how good it was by my younger cousin. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. The story brutally depicts the contrast between black and white. At times, I would have to grit my teeth in order to restrain myself from yelling at the racism portrayed throughout the book. Out of all the Grisham books I've read: The Pelican Brief, the Firm, and A Time to Kill, I'd have to say that A Time to Kill is definitely my favorite. It was so realistic that I had horrific nightmares about lynchings at night. To anyone that is considering to read a Grisham book, start with this one. It hooks you from the beginning and keeps you gripped until the end.
B0000027RL|5.0|Greatest album of the 90's, by the greatest band of the 90's, with the greatest lead singer of the 90's, the greatest solo guitarist of the 90's, and the greatest song of the 90's (Alive)<br />All the songs on the album are amazing, the influence this has had on modern rock is indescribable, these songs are just emotionally gut-wrenching
B00005B36H|5.0|I am disappointed to see some of the reviews on this site.  I will admit the first time I listened to it I immediatly thought &quot;is this the right CD?&quot;  But I brought up the lyrics from their website and read along with the songs and it all came back to me.  The thrill of listening to a Tool album, knowing that intelligent people put thought into every last second of the songs.  This album is every bit as good as their past ones--extremely well done.
B00000DLUV|5.0|They've done a marvelous job of putting together a collection of the best of their best! Thanks for the memories! Thanks for sharing such great talent. This will be a favorite of ours for a very long time.
B00005B36H|5.0|I can't tell you how much of a Tool fan I am.  I would say 75% of the music i listen to daily (on any given day) is Tool.  Before Lateralus came out I was sold that nothing was ever going to be as good as Undertow, I even thought Undertow was better than the fan-favorite Aenema.  However...after hearing this album Undertow has fallen into second.  I can't give enough praise to this album, but, like I did with Undertow, I will go with a track by track review.<br />1. The Grudge - I was thinking the album would open with some kind of filler track but no, taking a note from Aenema, one of the best songs is the opener, I heard this song and immediately knew that the guys were back.  Already one of my favorite Tool songs and the album has been out 3 days.  (9.5/10)<br />2. Eon Blue Apocolypse - A filler track that works as a lead-in to the next song, it's nothing special but it does its job (7/10)<br />3. The Patient - Perfection, this song is Tool at it's best.  The harmony in this song is utterly amazing and it shows Maynard's singing ability oh-so-well.  The climax of the song is just amazing.  (9.5/10)<br />4. Mantra - Another creepy lead-in track, again nothing special but it serves its purpose (7/10)<br />5. Schism - The big single, about the only song on the album that is even approaching radio friendly, it has a hook, but it's not a chorus like in most mainstream rock.  The hook is the bass part, it's very noticable and unlike any bass part I have heard in the last 10 years.  At 6:47 it is the shortest of the actual songs on the album.  That should paint a picture of how long the songs really are.  (9/10)<br />6/7. Parabol/Parabola - I will review Parabol and Parabola together because they are essentially one song.  This has been my favorite so far on Lateralus.  Parabol works as a simply amazing intro to the much harder Parabola which is yet another perfectly (and i mean perfectly) written, and perfectly crafted song.  If there is another song other than Schismthat would work on the radio this would probably be it, though it is about 3 times longer than the optimal radio length (9 minutes).  Worth the price of admission by itself (10/10)<br />8. Ticks and Leeches - Probably the most experimental song on the album.  This song is what Hooker With a Penis was to Aenema.  The hardest song on the album, and probably the most blatently emotional.  Maynard shows us a few blood curdling screams in this song, not something we hear from him very often. This is definitely never going to be a radio friendly song.  (9.5/10)<br />9. Lateralis - Other than Parabola my favorite on the album.  Musically probably the most challenging song they did for this album.  Maynards singing is nothing short of breathtaking on this song.  Definitely shows their commitment to progressiveness in their music.  The lyrical content so far has meant to me &quot;Don't take things so seriously&quot;, which I like to see as a plea to the fans that take the band way too seriously (namely me) :) (10/10)<br />10. Disposition -  Very hypnotic, I see it as a lead-in track to Reflection but I'm not quite sure that's what it was meant to be.  It's basically just 5 minutes of Bass, Guitar, and tribal drums with Maynard doing a small amount of singing. (8.5/10)<br />11. Reflection - The first seven minutes of the song are instrumental and then Maynard finally breaks in with a synthed voice which sounds really amazing.  This song sounds like it was recorded with a very expensive piece of hardware that changes sound waves through electromagnetism.  Sadly I have forgotten the name of this device.  In any case this one is for the progressive metal fans such as myself.  (10/10)<br />12. Triad - Instrumental track, turn out the lights and listen to this followed by the final track and I guarantee you will get at least a little scared.  Played with the same level of talent Tool has maintained since Undertow came out, but not as mind-stealing as the other tracks (8/10)<br />13.  Faaip De Quad - It suprises me that this track wasn't hidden.  It sounds like it should be, in any case it's pretty freaky and scared the hell out of me the first time I heard it.  (8/10)<br />All in all I have to say that this album is everything the fans asked for and more.  I sincerely believe that this album was worth the 5 year wait that the fans endured.  The only question now is: &quot;How will Tool suprise us with the next album?&quot;
B0000004V2|5.0|I bought this album 11 years ago and  it still finds it's way into steady rotation on my cd player.  I hate most of the stuff that comes out of the UK, but these guys were unique.  They wrote the most beautiful melodies, heaped on soaring choruses and the interplay between musicians was outstanding.  They played the most uplifting happy music but never sounded sappy.  It wasn't embarrassing to say you dug these guys.  Everyone I know who has heard this album has LOVED it.  Somehow, they managed to squeeze 30 years of pop music into one majestic piece of work.  From the distant clicking train tracks that introduce &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot; to the final tambourine shake at the end of &quot;Fool's Gold&quot;, the Stone Roses' debut inspires awe and adoration.  I'm running out of superlatives here.  It's as if they took every good element of indie-pop, folk-rock, funk, house and psychedelia and somehow made it click.  &quot;She Bangs The Drums&quot; is pure grandeur.  Not one hook or melody is wasted.  &quot;Waterfall&quot; takes it's cue from a propelling shuffle beat and a pulsing bass line that raise the shimmering guitars to heights way beyond your standard UK jangle guitar bands.  R.E.M. only wish their guitars could chime like this.  &quot;This Is The One&quot; is a the most uplifting cynical song ever and &quot;Shoot You Down&quot;'s soft brush drumming and gentle arpeggios create a magnificent ambience.  &quot;I Am The Ressurection&quot; sees the band start off in a Merseybeat pop style only to morph into a monstrous psychedelic jam that includes 12-string and countrified slide guitar, maracas, tambourines, bongos, funk-derived basslines and frenetic drum soloing.  It's as if all the 60's had been compressed into one eight-minute power pop jam.  In truth, there is not one bum track on the whole album.  John Squire's guitar playing is the unholy bastard child of Hendrix, Page, Johnny Marr, Paul Simon and Roger McGuinn.  Reni is the best drummer to come out ofBritain in a generation.  Not since John Bonham and Keith Moon had their been a limey drummer with such a distinctive style.  Mani's bass playing is functional, but, because he's surrounded by virtuosos, somebody has to keep it simple.  Ian Brown was tone-deaf live, so his vocals must have been run through heavy harmonizers and sequencers because he sounds good here.  At their peak the Roses could do no wrong.  Their b-sides could have easily been saved up and used as a second album, and it would have still been better than most bands' best outputs.  Oasis copped their attitude, the Verve borrowed their jam-heavy stylings, Blur took the art-school feyness and Radiohead even nicked their producer.  The Roses have to be the most influential and inspirational cult band in the world.  Unfortunately, they frittered away all their potential by delaying their second album, losing Reni's powerful drumming, by abandoning the sound that made people love them and by playing awful live shows.  Their aloofness turned into laziness and killed the band. At least they can be proud of this one gem they bestowed upon the music world. I was lucky to come across something this sublime at the moment it was unleashed upon the world.  God Bless.

B00004T9UF|3.0|after copping slim shady lp i couldn't wait for this to drop. Slim Shady lp was nuthin short of a masterpiece, Eminem was doing something no one else was in hip hop, and i was expectin him to have expanded as an emcee on this lp. And on some tracks, it clearly shows he has, the impressive &quot;Stan&quot; portrays the Artists-Fan relationship. Told in speech like &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; but this is on a much more serious note. The best track on the album for me is &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, which shows Eminem at his lyrical bes.... The next best cut is &quot;Under the Influence&quot; with close-friends-now-tuned-label-mates, D12. This is one bound to get your neck snapping and, D12 show us they are just as comical as Eminem. Very comical but greats lyrics at the same time. There are other good tracks such Marshall Mathers, which lets us have a look behind Eminem and Slim Shady, to see who is really there. Apart from that, the album seems to be trying to use shock tactics to sell records. Don't get me wrong, Eminem comes brilliantly lyrically to prove he is an outstanding emcee. But this album shows a switch of style from his previous offerings, and unfortunately, the reason was to appeal to a mainstream audience. An audience which is listening to Eminem, then straight after putting on an *NSYNC cd.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have been waiting 5 years alongside the other thousands of Tool fans for Lateralus. When I first got it and stuck it into my CD player, I was waiting for some instantly hard hitting opener a la Stink fist from Aenima. Instead I found a gradual buildup of rage and or joy at finally hearing something new from them. Maynard says that he &quo t;know[s] the pieces fit&quod; in Schism and I take this to mean that he this album is exactly what the music industry needed: a swift kick.... Try not to swallowthis album whole or else you might choke on the pieces. <br />To sum up: Buy this album.
B00005B36H|5.0|I purchased Lateralus on the night before it came on on its merits as a tool album alone. Upon the first listen, I was a little dissappointed. I found no immediately hooking songs that grabbed me in the way that songs on Aenima did. However, I knew that this album, like all tool albums, would need a few listenings to be fully appreciated. The boys in tool did not disappoint me. While \\"the grudge\\" and \\"schism\\" took hold immediately, it was just a couple of more listens before \\"the patient\\" mwas swirling in my head. \\"Parabol\\" and \\"parabola\\" occupied me to the point of distractionwhile hanging out with friends last night. This new tool album, while we may have waited too long for it, is without a doubt one of the best things to come along in a long time. Just because it is not as immediately catchy as aenima, don't shrug it off.... TOOL again delivers an uncompromised sound, unbeatable musicianship, and unforgetable lyrics.
0802130208|5.0|This is the greatest contemporary book I've ever read. It's a kaleidoscope of complicated characters, a bewildering city, and wisdom. While reading this book I found myself laughing-outloud and tearing-up simultaneously.
B00005JG6R|5.0|You MUST HAVE this one.  It has everything.  Great voice acting, state of the art animation, great charictors, excelent plot, good ideas, and some really cool bikes.  If you're into action packed gang war sci-fi action this is perfect for you!!  You will watch it over and over and over.  Anyone else will agree with me that this is one of the greatest anime works ever made!  It's simply increadibal.  Do whatever you have to to get your hands on this movie!
0767802659|3.0|OK film, good effects and acting.  It doesn't have much in common with the Robert Heinlein book, but it's still a decent quality movie.  If your a fan of the 'colonial marine' type books and movies, you're sure to like it.
B00000IL1K|4.0|I've never listened to Sarah Brightman before, and I 'd bought it soley based on the recommendations here, after listening to some of the samples.  Sarah has a high-pitch, feminine voice.    I can imagine some certain people liking this type of songs but they doesn't particularly appeal to me.  However, I don't dislike any songs in this CD, and I like Eden and Deliver Me.  Overall, I think this is a fine CD by a fine singer.
B00005B36H|2.0|I've been a tool fan since opiate and I must say, I couldn't imagine tool putting out a cd that was less than excellent.  It seems Maynard might be a little too full of himself these days.  The lyrics aren't on par for quality.  They seem to try to be artsy and really end up sounding like nonsensical babling, like we'd expect from Chino (deftones).  The vocals seem like you could interchange them with any song from a perfect circle.  They are whiney and lack conviction, in my opinion.  The music is mostly standard tool.  Unusual time, dissonance in guitar riffs and rythmic bass lines.  I prefer the &quot;Paul&quot; bass sound but that is not so much the issue.  Alot of these songs (read song #7) seem to be top 40 sounding.  Finally, I'd have to say the artwork with the CD is sub-par.  Opiate has the standard cd card, undertow has some interesting artwork, ribcage, fatwoman, the cow licking etc.  Anema had interesting artwork, the moving smoke box and eye etc.  This CD left me wanting more than just the transparencies with the not too deep meaning.  If you like A Perfect Circle, you'll like this.  If you are an old tool fan, you probably aren't going to read this anyway because you already bought it and you might feel the same way as I do.  If you own no tool cd's pick up undertow or aenema first, listen to it for a few weeks then buy this.
B00000DFRS|3.0|We all know Whitney Houston could do better than this. I think my fav Whitney album (besides her GREATEST HITS) is her self-titled 1985 album. There are only a few good songs on this album, and even the Remixes of those songs are better than the versions on this album. My personal favs on this CD are &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay&quot;, though the version on this album is too slow and I do not like it. I like the Thunderpuss Mix much better, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, and once again, the Jonathan Peters Mix is so much better than the original featured on this album. I also love &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, featuring Faith Evans and Kelly Price. And I love &quot;When You Believe&quot; - a duet with Mariah Carey, another one of my fav divas. If you want good Pop, then maybe this isn't the CD for you and you should get Whitney's self-titled album and her GREATEST HITS album. But if you're a die-heart Whitney fan, then this is definitely for you!

I like the Thunderpuss Mix much better, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, and once again, the Jonathan Peters Mix is so much better than the original featured on this album. I also love &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, featuring Faith Evans and Kelly Price. And I love &quot;When You Believe&quot; - a duet with Mariah Carey, another one of my fav divas. If you want good Pop, then maybe this isn't the CD for you and you should get Whitney's self-titled album and her GREATEST HITS album. But if you're a die-heart Whitney fan, then this is definitely for you!
B00005B36H|5.0|i don't get how some people can say this is better than aenima or worse than it<br />they're just too different if you were looking for aenima 2.0 on this cd i think you would be dissappointed<br />through every tool cd, they've changed so much and i've read a few reviews where it sounds like undertow now that i don't understand, that just tells me you haven't listened to undertow or lateralus at all<br />for myself, i didn't know what to expect, i knew it would be different, but i didn't expect lateralus so the first time i popped it in the cd, i was like, wow, ummm...i don't know if i like it<br />after playing it 5+ times, i couldn't stop playing it, and i think it'll take me many more months to decipher it, anyways thanks to tool for making such a great album, it's beautiful
B00003CXCS|5.0|Seeing this DVD brought back the wonderment and excitment that I had when I first saw this movie. It was simply marvelous, the &quot;extras&quot; enchance the watching experience, and the movie itself is flawlessly redone to make it visually wonderful. The ability to skip scenes back and forth was wonderful for when I had to leave the set. I really recommend that you buy this DVD, it will bring the magic back all over again.
B0000027F8|5.0|I bought this album for unknown reasons when it came out, and suffered slight (but amused) derision when I told everybody how good it was.  I emigrated from the UK to the US, and lost touch with much of my record collection for many years, but recently opened up boxes of CDs, and was once again blown away with this CD.  My music tastes have changed much in eight years, and a lot of my 20's music now seems purile, but this (and a few other albums from my box) are still gripping.  This one really tightens the old heart strings.<br />Well Done George Michael - you have created a classic for me.<br />I can't wait to play this for all my 40's neighbours at my next party and have them ask me - &quot;What IS this great CD.&quot;
078324228X|5.0|HURRICANE SHOWED THE REAL LIFE INJUSTICES IN OUR SOCIETY HOW A FEW WHITE PEOPLE CAN POINT A FINGER AND A BLACK MANS FREEDOM IS TAKEN AWAY. DENZELL JUST BROUGHT THE STORY OUT MORE ON THE BIG SCREEN WITH HIS TOP OF THE LINE ACTING. AND THE YOUNG BOY THAT HELPED HURRICANE AND THE GOOD PEOPLE FROM CANADA THANK THE LORD FOR ALL OF THEM HELPING HIM.  IT SHOWED US THAT THEIR IS STILL ANGELS OUT THERE IN ALL COLORS.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Great sound and picture quality. I dont want to refer to Band's awesome live performance &lt;God i just did :)&gt; Approximatly three hours of live performance including Metropolis(part 1), Mirror, Lie &lt;You can find those in the behind the scenes documentery&gt; A mind beside itself, Learning to live. But for me the most exciting thing to see was A Change Season performed in its entirity with Rudess' contribution. For the ones who could caught up with DT's world tour you can see yourselves in the World Tour photo album. And if you tought that LTE performence is missing from the DVD you'll find in this section a very good performed Acid Rain at the background. I only got one critic to make and it is : there is no intra band footage. I mean you never can hear your favorite band members talking to eachother. There arent any scenes like the ones in 5 years in a live time video. If you have a DVD player dont miss the chance to get this DVD it will SHOW YOU KINDNESS, BEAUTY AND TRUTH...
B00005BL2A|2.0|As a long time DM fan I eagerly awaited the arrival of my Exiter copy. After two listens, I'm glad Dave, Martin and Andy are back but I could have waited six more months for consistent material and better production. I always loved the graceful, sophisticated production of DM albums, however these qualities are blatently absent on parts of Exciter. What happened with 'Dead of Night'? This is the ONLY Depeche Mode song in over 20 years that I cannot bear to listen. Mark Bell should have left 'DoN' on the cutting room floor. There's nothing musical about the track and earlier &quot;rocky&quot; singles like 'I Feel You' and 'Barrel of a Gun' seem to shine compared to the noisy mess of 'Dead of Night'. 'I Feel Loved' is equally disappointing to me. Although I thoroughly enjoyed most of the album, I felt as though Mark Bell's production skills (minimal techno??)would be better suited for another band, not Depeche Mode. Compared to Tim Simenon's production of 'Ultra' (DM's last release) 'Exciter' sounds anti-musical at times. However, David Gahan's voice is back stronger than ever.Martin's lyrics and guitar coupled with Gahan's gorgeous vocals carry Exciter to overall success.
0553573403|5.0|I have read alot of fantasy, from Feist's Krondor books to Jordan's wheel of time. But this is the best, most realistic book avalible.  Unlike Jordans books, things happen, and the charicters are real, you can think that they are there, and can be real.  The battles are large and complex and are like real middle ages battles, but are told like Tolkens battles, from ground level, by someone with no power, besides fighting, but don't take that this is anything like Tolken, it isn't, in fact it reminds me more of the middles ages historical novels.  There is war, but not between orcs (which there are none of), instead between human armies, there is alot of politics, and surprises, but it all feels real.  I highly suggest reading this if Jordan is starting to  sicken you, or if you are getting bored of Terry Goodkind's books which are good but get boreing, not as bad as Jordans books though. If you want something without a hundred things seen before, buy this and read it.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is great and all, but only two or three songs really hook you and make you want to listen over and over. I think its really one of those albums you have to listen to over and over to appreciate it. Don't get me wrong - MJK has come a long way since Aenima, his singing has greatly improved, but it could have used some more memorable tunes. Still, a great CD. Not as good as Aenima though. Schism, Ticks &amp; Leeches and Lateralis are must-listens.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I use to love this cd, but then it started sounding like everything else. CLICHE
B0000029DD|5.0|I first listened having only heard &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; from the radio. &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; pulled me in, and by the end of track 2 (&quot;Grace&quot;), I was in sweaty disbelief. I heard a guy trying things I didn't know we were allowed to think to try, and he was nailing everything. My thoughts were: who makes music like this? This is almost ridiculous...  This album should serve to raise the bar for what passes as music. There are many musicians who should be more humble when they use the term &quot;art&quot; to describe what it is they make. In fact, &quot;Grace&quot; ought to make a lot of bands just shut-up and think things over for a while.   &quot;Grace&quot; is not for everyone, although I think eventually everyone could be ready for it, because it's about the state your in.
B000002UKS|5.0|the foo fighters really outdid themselves with this one. it's beautiful!
B000008GS2|5.0|Filled with great pop hooks and unusual instrumentation, Man of Colours is among the best of the Australian Pop albums.
B00005B36H|5.0|After listening to this cd through all the ebbs and flows, All of my other cds seem hollow and pointless, because I now have this cd. Even if you are not sure whether you might like it, it is THE must have cd of your life.  I can not stop listening to it.
0060934913|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in Kitchen Confidential, perhaps this was due more to the excessive hype than to Bourdain's writing style which did seem very snappy, very smooth and &quot;right on.&quot;<br />I was expecting something more on the order of Peter Mayle however, dense and rich.  Kitchen Confidential, while very interesting, seemed a bit &quot;thin.&quot;  Instead of giving us details, Bourdain simply glosses over.  Don't get me wrong, this is very interesting and entertaining glossing over and Kitchen Confidential is a lot of fun to read.  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for light, escapist fare.  Although I found Kitchen Confidential to be less than I expected, I did enjoy Bourdain's writing style so much that I bought his novel, Bone in the Throat.  I'll read it when I feel like laughing and not thinking very deeply.<br />As for Kitchen Confidential, I would recommend it only for those looking for something light and only for those who truly love food.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is a classic, recorded before Abbey Road but released later. Most of the songs are done in one take and shows that the Beatles can sound great in the studio without mastering tracks and doing clitch ups.  Let it Be and the long and winding road are perfect songs u listen to when u break up with someone. This album is classic!
B000003TBP|5.0|I can't write much more than what is already written in the reviews, but here goes:<br />&quot;Nevermind&quot; showed us what the 90's were going to be, &quot;Odelay&quot; show us what we would have liked it to be (no offense, Kurt).  <br />I almost wished Odelay had been released in 1999 to be a bookend to the decade, to show what musicians are going to be capable of in our current decade.  Alas we have since sunk deep into the mighty forces of crapdom.  I really hoped that Odelay would spark a strong transition from much of the fantastic stuff that was put out by the grunge movement, but it has since died.<br />Yes there is some great stuff that is being put out these days, but you have to depend on a leap of faith, since it's never played in rotation.  I get depressed when I see a marginal artist like Kid Rock get lauded for hum-drum power chords, , teeny-boppers trying to act like 35 year-old porno stars, or Fred Durst springing up in front of any camera with the little red light lit up.  <br />Odelay is what could have been.  Think of the TRASH period between &quot;the Joshua Tree&quot; and Pearl Jam...(I just got a cold chill).  Weezer....can your new album help me?
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I got this Cd for a Christmas present and it's a great album, I listen to it a lot, but now I found Sgt. pepper's and of course the legendary White album.  The new remastering might have messed up the sound a little bit, like the version of &quot;Let it Be&quot; is much different than the album's version and &quot;get Back&quot; doesn't have the little conversation ditty at the beginning but I have no idea! What surprised me was that &quot;hey jude&quot; was never on an actual Beatles album so if u are a big fan of the song u should get it. Sure I can't say this is the &quot;best of&quot; set, if it were a best of set u would have to have a box set because the Beatles famous work is what is on the albums and the b sides of the singles.  &quot;free as a bird&quot; wasn't included either which was kinda sad because that was the Beatles newest material and it deserved to have at least some credit on the album, I still like the album and the fact that it shows the current chart position and the covers of the singles.  Kudos to the Beatles, they saved Rock and roll last xmas from boy bands and teen pop superstars so they must have a little talent in 'em :-)
1572702095|4.0|it all depends on how you read AC's books.  if you like action and a lot of murders...then i would suggest &quot;and then there were none&quot; or my favorite, &quot;the big four&quot;.  this is unusal b/c it is told in first person.  i love how AC writes, using psycology, etc.  if you do too, you'll like this book.  most of it's charm is in the ending...one of the best AC endings on any of her books!  all in all, i really enjoyed reading this book and following along w./ the adventures of Hercule Poirot.  this is GREAT the first time...but it doesn't keep the suspense effect that is so important to the book after you've read it a few times.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Bee Gees songs but I became hooked on them again after watching a Biography program about them on A&amp;E and then their &quot;Live by Request&quot; performance on the same network.   I really like all the songs on their new CD, especially the sound of the title track, &quot;this is Where I Came In&quot;.  My other favorites are &quot;Man in the Middle&quot;, &quot;Sacred Trust, &quot;Wedding Day&quot; and &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot;, but there is not a single bad song on this CD.  The more I listen, the more I like it.  The vocals and the harmonies remind us why the Bee Gees have lasted for more than 4 decades.  I grew up listening to them, and I'll grow old listening to them.
B00005B36H|1.0|I've noticed the constant &quot;its not like thier other album which spoke to me&quot; if you'd learned any thing from Tool it would be to open you &quot;Third Eye&quot; and see some thing new and different, with its own, not the one before, art work.<br />Tool is not some thing you just get into because it sounds good, I like that guitar part and I like that drums part. <br />&quot;Tool is what you soak into your brain which opens it to what you don't see and don't want to, but its there&quot; <br />Maybe I didn't give it a 5 put thats because I'm being different as is this CD which very well is ignored, just looked at with &quot;Undertow&quot; and &quot;Aenima&quot; glasses that you put on that Tool never created.<br />&quot;Tool is some thing that you can listen to, and not even understand the words to but you get a feel, you know its art and beyhond&quot;
B000002J1M|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this cd not to long after I bought it. This is art rock at it's best, and I think after listening to this, one wouldn't believe that Genesis were capable of playing extremely complex music after hearing them as a pop act of the 80's and 90's, although that was good too. This cd starts of with the fast paced and otherworldy &quot;Watcher of The Skies&quot;, then proceeds to the softer &quot;Time Table&quot;. &quot;Get 'Em Out By Friday&quot;, is also great and complex featuring Peter Gabriel's eccentric, great voice. &quot;Can-Utility and the Coastliners&quot;, also excellent and gets even more complex, especially at the end of the song, which almost sounds fairy-like and otherworldly. &quot;Horizons&quot;, is a 1 1/2 minute classically influenced guitar instrumental and is beautiful. Some might say that &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;, is the initial highlight of the album, but to me it's just one more fabulous track along with the rest of the album. Standing at 23 minutes, this is arguably the most musically and lyrically complex on the cd. My favorites parts are V-VII. Willow farm features some madcap humor and vocals from Peter Gabriel and I love it. Apocalypse in 9/8, is unbelievable. I wonder how the hell does Tony Banks pull off those organ solos, I also wonder if his hands hurt or get tired?, it is unbelievable. Then it segues out with &quot;Eggs...<br />Overall, this was a fabulous cd and alot closer to the type of art rock that I prefer: Complex, Quirky, Melodious and out there. Bands like Yes and Pink Floyd are good, but I think this album alone blows both of those bands out of the water. If you like Jethro Tull and early Queen (like I do) than this is the cd (and band for that matter) to get into. I'm only sorry that I didn't discover this earlier.<br />Thanks.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is beatiful, makes me happy. Im glad TOOL has left AENIMA behind them and moved on. Well, you can, of course, hear in a second that its TOOL  playing, its not a new sound, its just more complex and interesting songs. Just beatiful, they moved on to where noone has been before to explore music, expand the horizons. This album smells like freedom in a place youve never been before, and Im not atlking about &quot;stinkfist&quot;.
B000000OAL|4.0|I own many Queen cd's, and this was probably the one I appreciated the least out of my Queen collection. But some 2 years later, I started listening to it more after wearing out Q2, Sheer Heart Attack and A Night at the Opera. It started growing on me big time. &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, was the hit of the album, but honestly is my least favorite of the disc. &quot;Doing All Right&quot;, is soft/heavy, and beautiful. &quot;Great King Rat&quot;, is regal Queen at their finest. &quot;My Fairy King&quot;, is probably my favorite or second favorite on here, as it shows Queen at the progressive rock leanings, as they began to develop and mature as the years went on. It mixes Hard Rock, Classical, and Opera like influences and you can hear Freddie's flamboyance throughout. &quot;Liar&quot;, another great track and as well as &quot;fairy king&quot;, is more like a complex epic. &quot;The Night Comes Down&quot;, is soft. &quot;Modern Times...&quot;, is a 2-minute fast paced heavy rocker sung by Roger Taylor. &quot;Son &amp; Daughter&quot;, is a glam-heavy metal song with Freddie's androgynous and venomous vocals. Great stuff. &quot;Jesus&quot;. Great Tune. It sounds theatrical and as if it came from a broadway musical.<br />Overall, this was a great start for Queen, and it gave hints at what the band would become later on.<br />thanks.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Gorgeous sets and powerful use of color are in display for Burton's film version of the short story by Washington Irving.  The New York city sets illustrate what life may have been like before 1800, but the minute Depp steps into the Hollow, the sets become more and more menacing.  The deer on the posts give the viewer the impression that one is going into a surreal dream-like world.  This is accented by the use of color.  In most scenes, the color is almost muted, giving a gothic black and white vision to the inhabitants (especially the stranger who is Icabod Crane).  While Crane has been transformed from an ugly school teacher to a rational, yet tainted by magic, constable, he is understandable and sympathetic.  The color comes mostly during dramatic bloody scenes (although the violence is less than it could possibly be).  The performances (especially by Miranda Richardson) are very well done.  No, this isn't the scariest version or movie you'll ever see, but the suspense is handled well, and there are a couple of &quot;jump&quot; scenes.<br />The DVD comes with some extras (rare for Paramount, unfortunately) and while the &quot;featurette&quot; is basically scenes from the trailers, it is nice to hear the director and stars talk about their experiences.  The transfer is good, with the film much richer, of course, in the 1.85:1 than it ever could be in pan and scan.  There are some notable surprising stars showing up here (Christopher Walken, especially after mentioning the legend in Dead Zone) and overall, a very well done mystery/suspense film.  Yes, some critics have roundly criticized the ending, but it does hang with the rest of the film.   Four stars out of a possible five here.
B000059TPI|5.0|I love this Movie. It's great to watch when your sick as I garutee it will lift your spirits. This is one of those rare movies that efectivly combines dry, witty humor with slapstick and gags making it a movie all ages and all types can enjoy.
B00004VVNB|5.0|to me.  I really love the overall look of the movie too.  I think the &quot;cheesy&quot; look of the film is VERY appealing to me.  This is defiently a movie you will either love or hate.  I absolutely can't understand how someone could take off more than one star for the effects not being up to par.  I don't think this movie needs the greatest effects in the world to be a great movie.  The story is extremely interesting to me.  I gave this movie 5 stars and I think it deserves them.  I am not saying this movie is better than say &quot;2001&quot; although I am sure a lot of people would much rather watch this than that especially younger people who would find &quot;2001&quot; boring as heck.  Just open your mind and forget the cheesy effects and have a really good time watching this movie.  I am a very proud owner of this DVD.
0767821769|3.0|Before I start describing how good the movie was, I want to stop at both actors Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. If they are put in a silent movie, of no words and not even subtitles, they can make the film emotionally rich just by their facial expressions! I mean, you easily fall in love with those two actors because of their emotional faces and eyes.<br />The is a light movie, that all family can enjoy watching together. It's based on emotional conflict between a family with two kids and a stepmom (Julia Roberts). In this movie you'll enjoy the emotional driven laughs and tears all the way until the end.<br />One of the things that you'll enjoy most in this film is that you'll enjoy your life better and appreciate more many things in your life that you have taken for granted.<br />THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS of Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. And if you loved this movie you'll love more Julia Roberts' movie &quot;My Best Friend Wedding&quot;.
630575067X|1.0|this movie was dull, flat, tedious, unimaginative, badly acted, and just not entertaining.  You have to be a serious Star Wars fan to like this..I mean it was awful..I recently have seen an interview with george lucas from the 1980's in which he stated (at the making of The Empire Strikes Back) that his heart was gone out of this trilogy , he just wanted to get it over with and the only reason he is making the next 2 films is because he promised they would be made..and it showed The Empire strikes Back is so cheesy and plastic I find it comical..so why did he make this movie 20 years later? For commercial reasons, his heart isn't in it and sorry folks George Lucas is not an imaginative person, well maybe as imaginative as Dr. Suess...please
0316286443|5.0|Gorgeous!  Kevyn Aucoin's work really shines in this one.  The photos are gorgeous, the models are gorgeous, everything is just gorgeous.  The book makes a great reference for anybody wanting to try various new looks and it's a great addition to any home library.  5 stars all the way!
1577311760|5.0|Eckhart's message is simply the quintessential of all world teachings.  He reveals that enlightment is not only attainable, but natural.  Being a disciple of an eastern master, the presentation of this message represents the flowering of that discipleship, the flowering of the unmanifest that is available in each of us.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I suppose the best way to describe this cd is to describe Depeche Mode themselves. I have been a fan for about 10 years and I have noticed that people either love them or hate them. That is one thing that I really like about them, because I feel that will keep them going strong.<br />As far as the cd, I will admit it is a bit different then some of their earlier stuff. When I first listened to it, I wasn't sure what to think, after Ultra, which was a bit harder, Exciter seems like it could be a let down. But after the second listen songs started making sense and I knew that I was with Andy, Martin and David. It just seems that this album has a theme, which is love, now of course 80% of their music is about love, but this seems a bit more positive. It makes me feel really good. Now the music is still dark and bizarre, but that is the Depeche Mode way. I can understand if someone that isn't in touch with that side of them wouldn't like this cd. There are a couple faster songs, &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; and &quot;The Dead of Night&quot;, which plays like &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot;  Part 2. The one song that is playing over and over again in my head is  &quot;Freelove&quot; it is one of the slower songs, but it is such a pretty song. David's vocals are awesome, and it has that vintage DM sound to it.<br />I can say that I pretty much grew up with Depeche Mode and their songs have been a good escape for me. I am not saying that I would play &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; to solve my problems, but I think other fans of DM know what I mean. They truly are a great band, and this album shows it. Yes it is slower, but hey they are getting better with age. I do miss some of there faster tunes, but these songs take you to a good place.<br />I went to see them on their &quot;Singles Tour&quot; and they were lager than life. So just keep an open mind. It might be dark, but it isn't depressing, it is pure Depeche Mode.
6300214354|5.0|I am usually not interested in the low comedies (farces, parodies, slapstick, etc.) and rather I enjoy witty satirical humor much more.  However, this movie was an exception--this is Val Kilmer at his best, and had me laughing the rest of the night.
B00003CXAR|5.0|If you haven't seen this film you are either too young or have lived your life up a mountain by yourself. Needless to say the shark is rubber and not very good, but the film itself is so brilliant you hardly realise it. Buy this film now, and on DVD it has never looked so well.
1556154844|5.0|Please this on your team's reference list.  Make sure to get a copy for each developer (no need to be cheap when you're trying to develop world-class software)!<br />This book will trigger ideas and provide the foundation for consistent, world-class software in your team.  If you're a manager, make sure that you read it to!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|First of all, I must say that while all the reviewers have been busy praising the vocal skills of Nicole and Ewan, they have not given enough credit to the wonderful French ballad sung by the finest musician of the last decade - Rufus Wainwright. This young man's sensitive rendition of 'Compliante De La Butte' is the very essence of 'Moulin Rouge' and is by far the best song on the soundtrack.<br />Check out more of Rufus' work on his new album 'Poses', and for Gods' sake, get 'Moulin Rouge'. I was HIGHLY sceptical of it, but it turned out to be a sound investment. It has a high repeat value.
6305546789|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you should, even if your not a fan of horror films. Halloween is the original slasher, movie. (yes, I know texas chainsaw massacre and psyco came before it) This movie is really the basis for every other slasher movie that has come out after 1978. Any person who considers themselves to be horror movie fans needs to rent or buy this movie. One of the top grossing horrors of all time and it's loved by the critics too, suprisingly. Halloween has Almost no gore in the tradition of hitchcock. Lots of close calls between myers and his victims. Easily one of the best horror films of all time.
0553296981|4.0|This was a pretty good book a great way for kids to learn about the holocaust and how a young girl would feel during this time i give it two thumbs up!
B00003CX9S|4.0|The Elephant Man was a wonderfully gripping drama about the life of a sadly deformed young man doomed to spend the rest of his life as a carnival sideshow &quot;freak&quot;, until a compassionate doctor (Anthony Hopkins) takes an interest in him and offers him sanctuary in a hospital and giving him back his dignity.  I read the play when I was in high school speech class, and it touched me so much even then that I was pleasantly surprised to see it as a movie, so I rented it and watched it.  the movie followed the book as I remember it extremely well, and I was actually able to visualize the horrible deformities that this man suffered as well as the torment.  I was surprised at how well everything was portrayed, from the storyline to the makeup.  The music was at a minimum, but that added to the overall great effect of the movie.  It was also in black and white, which leads me curious as to when the film was actually made.  It is one of those &quot;classic&quot; stories that captures your attention and leaves you breathless.  Add to that the fact that it is a TRUE story, and you have a masterpiece.
0440219078|5.0|I have nothing to say but, drop everything and read this book!!!!!!
B000051VWW|5.0|This album will rock you to peace while you work.  Sade's voice stays smooth and the bass is hypnotic.  Enjoy!
B00005B36H|5.0|I love the Cd... but I also like A Perfect Circle more than Tool... This CD is like, a perfect mix of Tool and A Perfect Circle... It's great.   :o)
B00000DQWT|4.0|One needs to have watched the movie to enjoy the musical score, as a backdrop to how life seemed to go awry for two Catholic former altar boys. Pat Metheny's style is elemental, somewhat echolaliac, and definitely original. I suppose recalling the starkness of life that had gotten awry from much promise makes one reach back to what made life promising. Thus, from many of those who had reviewed this album, the music might falter in encouraging Pat Metheny would-be fans. I think that for an artist to lend his originality to a film that was stirring (or any film that stirs thoughts towards philosophy-making) Pat Metheny stands out rather well.
B00005B36H|5.0|Being a fan of Tool for almost 6 years, I couldn't wait till this album finally came out (it was long the wait).  The songs are incredible, musically superior than their previous albums, and I think people give it 4 stars because of that, because there are no pop singles on this album (like Stinkfist or Sober were).  This band is our generation's Pink Floyd: artistic, avant garde, and beyond talented.  Worth the hype
6305428050|3.0|Despite the score I love this movie. But the truth is it is neither funny enough or clever enough to warrant a higher score. Elisabeth Shue is extremely winning in her first lead role, and really deserved to go onto better things.  Adventures follows Elisabeth on her journey with the three kids she's babysitting and her attempt to help a friend stuck in the city. They get into all sorts of theoretically wacky scrapes that never really hit the comedic peaks you'd hope. But the whole journey adds up to a satisfying experience and you'll probably find yourself with a stupid grin by the end. On a side the note, this DVD is quite poor, the picture is not anamorphic and the sound is not Dolby Digital.  If you look back at eighties movies with fondness this is probably a worthy purchase.
0316777722|4.0|David Sedaris is a humorist who writes essays on the human condition - his specifically and in general. He strikes me as a curmudgeon-in-training, who, after further aging, will qualify for the closing act on a very popular and long running TV newsmagazine broadcast on Sunday evenings.<br />ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a series of 28 essays spanning the author's childhood to the present. The book's title is also that of one of the chapters, in which he relates the experience of learning French in Paris under the tutelage of a xenophobic Frenchwoman whose style relies heavily on the liberal application of humiliation and abuse. Most of the essays succeeded at making me laugh - certainly not in guffaws, but at least amused snorts. A few didn't. The subjects of some of the more successful included: being mistaken for a local pickpocket on the Paris M&eacute;tro by two American tourists, describing American idiosyncrasies as perceived by foreigners, doing New York Times crossword puzzles, describing the concept of Easter to a Muslim, and showing two friends from North Carolina around New York City. For me, the funniest selection was \\"Big Boy\\", which, unfortunately, was pure bathroom humor that can't be described here. (Hey, I never claimed to have elevated tastes!)<br />David's brand of raillery won't appeal to everyone. While always perceptive, it often is, like Mark Twain's, tongue-in-cheek. The following three examples will serve to illustrate. They concern, respectively: American nouveau cuisine, speaking \\"French\\" in France, and politically correct water conservation.<br />\\"The patty melt has been pushed aside in favor of the herb-encrusted medallions of baby artichoke hearts, which never leave me thinking, Oh, right, those! I wonder if they're as good as the ones my mom used to make.\\"<br />\\"The second, less complicated form of French amounts to screaming English at the top of your lungs, much the same way you'd shout at a deaf person or the dog you thought you could train to stay off the sofa... Easy French is rooted in the premise that, if properly packed, the rest of the world could fit within the confines of Reno, Nevada.\\"<br />\\"The card (in the hotel bathroom) reported the amount of water used every year in hotel laundry rooms and suggested that, in having my sheets and towels changed on a daily basis, I was taking this precious water directly from the cupped hands of a dehydrated child. I noticed there was no similar plea encouraging me to conserve the hot water that came with my fifteen-dollar pot of room-service tea, but that apparently was a different kind of water.\\"<br />You know, I like this guy.to stay off the sofa...

0783235380|3.0|Yet again the talents of the wonderful Sandra Bullock are wasted in an average movie. Ben Affleck plays Ben who is on his way to his wedding but gets stuck with the kooky Sarah (Bullock) when their plane crashes. Then a manic road journey takes place as together they attempt to reach their destination. Except the journey never is that manic and the comedy is constrained somewhat by some drama elements. To give the film credit it is beautifully shot, almost to the point of distraction. Sandra is lost in dodgy make up as the wacky Sarah who serves as a temptation to uptight Ben. The fact that they inspire each other is predicatable, but the ending is not. That this film is billed as a romantic comedy is not quite accurate. It is not funny enough, there is the dramatic edge to the story that is almost more effective and the romance is not supplied in the usual way. This is the stumbling block, if the film makers had chosen which route they wanted to take this could have been an outstanding film. What we are left with instead is an enjoyable but unremarkable way to waste 90 minutes.
0783231202|5.0|Whatever faults Amistad may have as an accurate representation of a real historical event, or from a purely dramatic standpoint, these faults pale into insignificance compared to the importance of the story in so many aspects. That all too many Americans all too often acted at best indifferently to slavery, and that many of their descendants (among whom I count myself) still seem not to understand the barbarism involved is truly shameful. Kudos to Spielberg and producer Debbie Allen for telling this story, kudos to the actors (especially Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, and Anthony Hopkins) for their representations, but most importantly kudos to the actual heroes involved. Other critics have claimed that Spielberg has made the characters too stereotypical and one-dimensional--I don't find this an accurate criticism, given that the abolitionists have an argument when one of them says that the slaves would be more beneficial to their cause as martyrs; and given that John Quincy Adams does his best to avoid any involvement in the case at all. Indeed, I thought that the story, primarily a courtroom drama colored by politics and economics, rather than a swashbuckling tale of revolt at sea, was complex, sophisticated and beautifully told. True, there were a few moments when Spielberg let Hollywood run away with him. The most notable of these occurred when the swelling chorus and the lighting drowned the genuine feeling when Djimon Hounsou declares to the courts &quot;Give Us Us Free!&quot; in sickly-sweet sentiment. But in an age when the US Supreme Court seems to have given up any pretense of non-partisanship, and when so many politicians care less about what is morally right than what is economically profitable, Amistad is a movie that ought be required viewing.<br />As a composer, I have one major complaint: the music (&quot;by&quot; John Williams) seemed to me to be blatantly plagiarised from Aaron Copland, especially the opening of his ballet Billy the Kid. How Copland's estate allows this to happen I don't understand. Ironic in a movie about morality and ownership.Copland's estate allows this to happen I don't understand.

0783230079|4.0|Ron Underwood (City Slickers) has delivered a thoroughly entertaining fantasy with Heart and Souls.  Robert Downey Jr plays a man inextricably linked with four people who all died at the very moment he was born. This is a great springboard for Downey Jr's talents, as he is taken over by each personality in turn, in their search to find the one thing they missed when alive. This is a funny, sweet and romantic film that is well worth checking out. It's the kind of movie guaranteed to cheer you up and leave a slight lump in your throat. All the main performances are great, though sadly Elisabeth Shue is given very little to do.  Any person with an aversion to slushy fantasies should stay away, the rest of us can sit and enjoy!
B00004TFK3|5.0|I caught Men in Black when it first came out in theatres, and I've just seen it again and been delighted.  It loses little if anything in its translation to the small screen.  I'm not a great fan of Hollywood's mining of comic books for storylines, but Men in Black (along with the original Batman movie, X-Men, and Mystery Men) shows how well it can work at its best.  The aliens are wonderfully bizarre and diverse--although many of them retain muppetoid characteristics this seems entirely in keeping with the tone of the film.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones manage not to be stood up by the creature effects; Vincent D'Onofrio revels in portraying the evil alien wearing an &quot;Edgar suit&quot;.  But best of all, the writing is terrific--the plot is twisted enough to keep you going most of the way, and the comic dialogue is superior. My only quibble is that I could have done without Smith's rap for the closing credits, which lacked his characteristic charm and unsuccessfully tried to make up for that lack with unrelenting monotony as all too many raps do. Otherwise, highly recommended. Rumor has it that a sequel is in the works with both Smith and Jones for a 2002 release.  Let's hope that all involved maintain the same high standards.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. The music and the production values are topnotch, and I finally understand the story in its entirety (couldn't quite figure it out from the CD and lyrics). I don't know if I'll ever get to see these guys live, but now I feel that I almost have.<br />I've read some of the criticisms, and they mostly strike me as Monday-morning quarterbacking. Since most people are going to be viewing this on a TV or computer monitor, a 4:3 aspect ratio was the only reasonable way to go - good call, Mike Portnoy. Yes, I suppose they could have eliminated the cut-scenes and artwork, but that would have taken away one part of the concert experience that I, for one, value. Maybe Dolby 5.1 would have helped some people, but again, most are going to be listening to it on a basic 2.1 system, and it sounds great that way.<br />If you are a DT fan, or simply like great concert video, get it and enjoy it!

B000002JSN|5.0|For all the talk of ZOSO and &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, it is PHYSICAL GRAFFITI that ranks as Led Zeppelin's most complete masterpiece, more accurately showcasing all of the band's strengths.<br />The rockers throb and ache, and the accoustic numbers float with the kind of magic Page always strove for.  This is a double album that leaves you wanting more.<br />The first disc--&quot;Custard Pie,&quot; &quot;The Rover,&quot; &quot;In My Time Of Dying,&quot; &quot;Houses Of The Holy,&quot; &quot;Trampled Under Foot,&quot; and the epic &quot;Kashmir,&quot;--may be the greatest series of tunes ever assembled on a hard Rock or metal LP.  The songs are great, the performances inspired and flawless, and Jimmy Page's production, as always, is perfection.<br />On the second disc, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; aches and groans, with a masterful vocal from Robert Plant and one of the best-ever guitar solos from Page.<br />&quot;Down By The Seaside&quot; starts as some kind of homage to hometown life, the idyllic village by the sea.  But there's something there that gets under Plant's skin--&quot;people turned away-see how they run?&quot;--and it lets loose the only time on a Led Zep record where Plant, the flower-child love-child pie-in-the-sky peacenik--sounds really angry, pointing his finger at, I suppose, those holier-tha-thou critics who constantly harped on Zep's supposed failure to acknowledge it's influences: &quot;Do you still do the twist--do you find you remember things that well?  I wanna tell you, some folks' twisting every day, though sometimes it's hard to tell...&quot; <br />Well, that might be a stretch.  No matter.  PHYSICAL GRAFFITI is the essence of Led Zeppelin.  If you own no other record by these masters of hard Rock, own this one.
B000002LAB|5.0|This is one of Miles' best records.  The colors in it remind me faintly of his recordings with Gil, and the sounds used on the synth work perfectly with Miles' tone with the harmon.  As usual, his search for new sounds is successful.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Not for a long time have we been spectators to an epic film... Gladiator brought us back into the realm of our past, and I loved it for that.  It brought us back to the tremendous Roman Empire, to the command of a General, fighting for his Ceasar, his Empire, his Rome... However, like always things take a turn for the worst, and the General is outcast by the Thrown's heir, mourns for loved ones past, forced into slavery and regains a sword to revenge, in the form of the crowd.  The story is a moving and stunning one, providing a good backbone to the film.<br />The backbone is supported with an incredible array of images and scenes, (for example the breathtaking flaming arrows flying high over the battle field, in the opening scene) with amazing special effects transporting us back into the world of Rome, the world of an Empire... its lavish and ornate theatres, games and lives.<br />Russell Crowe had caught my attention in 'L.A. Confidential', but secured it with this.  As the General, slave, and gladiator, Crowe stands his ground next to some true cinema legends, and I was impressed with his performance.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers well, and brings our attention back to the whinny, creepish badies, thursty for power and unattained glory.  The British legends are drawn upon... with the likes of Richard Harris, as the aging Ceasar, who I'm pleased to see back on the big screen likewise with the late Oliver Reed, as the freed Gladiator, following a distinctive absence of their work.  To me this will always be Reed's film, and although not his finest hour (with contenders like The Three Musketeers), it is certainly up there with the best; Harris said that this would have revived Reed's career, he may have been right... I will always remember him for this, the crowd will remember.  Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner/Alien) adds a rung to his ladder with this masterpiece of cinema, reaffirming him as one of Britain's best directors.<br />The film can boast a multitude of awards under its belt, especially in regards to the Oscars, which I must admit being disappointed that it didn't carry away a few more...<br />The Gladiator DVD 2 disc, is among the top ten DVDs of all time, in terms of its picture and sound quality.  With superb extensive extras to match, the likes I have not seen since the DVD release of 'Bridge On The River Kwai'.  The documentaries cover all areas of production, and invites you back into the world of Rome through the eyes of a spectator, a spectator in the crowd... It won me.
B00003003R|5.0|I've just starting listening to Guns' music and I think that they were the best band ever to grace this fair planet, and these CDs just sum that up. Both discs are pure brilliance, and although I was surprised at the additions of It's Alright, You're Crazy and Out Ta Get Me and the withdrawals of Civil War, Double Talkin' Jive and Live And Let Die, the rest of the material makes up for it by far!! I do not know why people are so uptight about the alleged lack of quality as for one, it's not poor quality at all, it's very good quality just not upmost perfection. Besides, this 'poor quality' gives the CD it's live feel, and I think that it makes the release much better.       Another thing I couldn't understand is why people thought that the second CD wasn't good. How about the consecutive line-up of Move To The City, You Could Be Mine, Rocket Queen, Sweet Child O'Mine (!!!!!!), Knockin' On Heavens Door (Better than the UYI2 video as you can hear the crowd scream their lungs out!!), Don't Cry (Orig. Lyrics), Estranged and Paradise City!!       I was pleased by the ongoing crowd noise also, as it gives it that little bit extra live feel, and who cares if they are from seperate live shows, any GN'R fan would be pleased by this purchase as the songs are stunning, no matter what quality or from which gig or no matter how much crowd singing, and when you hear the songs you especially like (Mine are Nightrain,Mr. Mr Brownstone, You Could Be Mine, Welcome to the Jungle, + the stated run of excellent songs (see previously)you are just glad that the songs were made and that you are hearing them. RECOMMENDATION:BUY NOW, BUY NOW, BUY NOW, BUY NOW, BUY NOW!!!!!- You won't be sorry as they are definetly worth spending your cash on!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Pop, R&amp;B, Dance, Latin, Rock and Opera.  All these styles mix successfully on this hop soundtrack to probably one of the most anticipated films of the year. The Nicole Kidman - Ewan McGregor romance musical features a fantastic soundtrack, which director Baz Luhrman has produced.  After a rather disappointing start to the album with David Bowie's &quot;NATURE BOY&quot;, it picks up with the funky R&amp;B take on LaBelle's classic &quot;LADY MARMALADE&quot;, with Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink &quot;Voulez Voucher Chez Avec Moir&quot;-ing their way through this hot single.  Then the upbeat and exhausting dancefloor destined &quot;BECAUSE WE CAN&quot; from Fatboy Slim keep the action going.  The next track is one of the album highlights &quot;SPARKLING DIAMONDS&quot;, which is a medley of such tunes as &quot;Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;.  The performers are lead actress Nicole Kidman (who is quite a good singer), and minor costars Jim Broadbent, Carloine O'Connor, Natalie Mendoza and Lara Mulcahy.  Whenever a song is written by Diane wareen it's either going to be a Number One hit, or a fantastic track or both.  Warren, who has penned hits for Aerosmith, Toni Braxton, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Ricky Martin, wrote the funky &quot;RHYTHM OF THE NIGHT&quot;, an upbeat latin dance groove with little known Valeria dancing the night away at the Moulin Rouge.  From there it slows down for Ewan McGregor's &quot;YOUR SONG&quot;.  &quot;CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION&quot; is a fast paced rock update with U2's front man Bono, Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer (?) all pumping on the volume.  Nicole Kidman pops up a second time for the hearty ballad &quot;ONE DAY I'LL FLY AWAY&quot;, and this track has the kind of potential to be a number one single.  Beck gives us the odd track &quot;DIAMOND DOGS&quot; followed by another medley, &quot;ELEPHANT LOVE MEDLEY&quot; with McGregor and Kidman making a winning team a singing all about love (Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong, All We Need Is Love, I Will Always Love You, just to name a few).  The two then re-team for the goregoeus duet &quot;COME WHAT MAY&quot;.  Then things turn strange for the following track &quot;EL TANGO DE ROXANNE&quot;.  McGregor, Jose Feliciano and the lesser known Jacek Koman get spicy then scary with this haunting tune.  Rufus Wainwright delivers the perfect romance tune with &quot;COMPLAINTE DE LA BUTTE&quot;.  Kidman reappears along with costars John Leguizamo abd Alka Yagnik for the not as good but still worthy of a listen &quot;HINDI SAD DIAMONDS&quot;.  Then we get a Bowie cooming back with &quot;NATURE BOY&quot; only this time heled out by Massive Attack and to finish the unforgettable listening experience that is Moulin Rouge, a bonus track, a funky more dance remix of Kidman and McGregor's duet &quot;COME WHAT MAY&quot;<br />The australian version I reviewed, may be different to the US versions.
078401020X|5.0|I don't understand the people who claim they still haven't figured out who the killer in this film.  This is no puzzle-the closing scene answered all questions.  This film is the true meaning of masterpiece.  A brilliant sociopath acts out another pre-planned murder spree-but wait-she finds her match of the moment and enjoys his companionship for the time being.  That's what made the film most fascinating.  One woman-clearly mad finds this detective who although seemingly normal has at one point in his past been just as mad as she is.  They are meant for each other...but she has to be the victor so most likely will kill him.  I'm so glad I saw this on the big screen-1 of only a handful of times I've gone to the movies.  The writing, the setting, the dialog - all wonderful.  Of course Sharon made this film.  A true movie star.
B00000I9MK|5.0|Tigersmilk is the perfect music to listen to in a college dorm room in 2001 - maybe a little high, hung over, or just really tired.  It is the kind of music that can be just listened to, or thought about (and one can even obsess over it if need be).  A 90's mix of Donovan (funny, kind of nonsensical lyrics, and a wholly silly attitude - plus scottish of course)and the Velvet Underground (soft, almost muted sound) - and they certainly pay homage to their influences.  This cd is almost perfect.  Yes - some songs are stronger than others (track 3 is amazing - whereas I would say track one falls a bit flatter) on the whole the album is a really strong first work (and the cover of the cd is really cool).  While I'd argue that this isn't the strongest album Belle and Sebastian have produced (that is probably Boy with the Arab Strap) it is still a solidly great piece of work.
B00005B36H|5.0|The first time I listened to this, I was disappointe and even a bit pissed off.  Listening to it again, I saw each song in a totally different light and was totally moved.

6305807426|4.0|WOW!  What the heck was going on with this flick?  The film had a true sense of Argento's style with flash, bizzare murders set to the creepiest music and lighting, but unlike Deep Red, this movie made no sense whatsoever!  Even with seeing Suspiria before Inferno, this movie made no sense.  I'm not saying the movie was bad, because the muders were shot in such a true Argento style, that you had to like them.  So many questions of this flick were left unanswered.  What was up with the hot dog vendor?  What was up with the ending?  Who knows...maybe we'll find out when Argento finishes the trilogy up.  I reccommend this flick to seasoned Argento fans, or those who have seen Suspiria, but don't make this your first Argento film, start with Deep Red.

630505116X|3.0|Deep Rising's director, Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Adventures of Huckle Berry Finn), seems to always have a serious/tongue-in-cheek comedy horror film put together. I recently saw the Mummy returns and wow was that corny. Deep Rising is good enough to watch over and over again but has a terrible plot, pethetic actors and some of the stupidest dialogue I have ever heard. Awesome monster effects though and cool idea. I'm very glad Stephen didn't entitle this film, &quot;Tentacles&quot;, &quot;Deep Rising&quot; is more creative.
0671042858|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have ever read.  And usually I love King's work.  The girl isn't very bright and she doesn't develope like a regular character of stephen king's.  The book was a great dissappointment.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is really good. It's perfect for venting out those emotions with its screaming, disturbed lyrics. The highlights of the disk are One Step Closer, Crawling (we should be familiar with those two singles), Papercut (the soon-to-be single)Runaway, and Forgotten. The songs are GREAT! One Step Closer is their single that exploded them onto the scene, and they keep it going with Crawling. Papercut is an absolutely amazing opening to an absolutely amazing album. Something I like about them is they don't need to swear to get their point across. Limp Bizkit, on the other hand, does. I wonder if that is why they are popular sometimes. LP doesn't swear, yet are still cool. I'm sure the songs sound great live. They are playing with Ozzfest. Since their songs are raging, you'd think the words would be dominated by the six swears that there are. But, no. good job on a great album guys. I listen to it CONSTANTLY. Great for blasting. Not too loud though, you don't want to be listening to BArney and Tellitubies as a punishment from the Police. Not cool.
B000001Y42|5.0|As unbelievable as it may sound at one time limp bizkit was THE greatest rock/rap band.  With three dollar bill, y'all i would go as far as to say it is one of , if not the greatest debut album from a band of this genre.  As much as i hate to admit it i stay loyal to limp bizkit BECAUSE of this album.  Defineitely one to rush out and buy right away.
B00004XONN|5.0|Ive read plenty of the reviews here of Kid A.  and am not surprised at all, really.  First of all, i am a composer/euphonium player and can write in the style of anyone from bach to mahler to korn to radiohead to bjork to aphex twin to duke ellington to philip glass to grainger to everlast to MOONDOG to snoop dog.  and, i love it all.  i think, when youve heard so much stuff and were able to get into it through spirituality, technique, playing it, dancing to it, falling asleep to it, or whatever you do.  i think there is a niche for everything.  without a doubt in my mind about that.  i think that musicians should not sell out to popular demand and should do what ever the F**K they wanna do.  people need to ease up on musicians and stop idolizing them because i know from personal experience that being an idol alienates the real you from the people who idolize you.  i also think that if a musician sells out to demand than, to hell with the musician, not the music.  enjoy it for what it is. from this album, i first heard Idioteque somewhere, and i thought about it. and learned that if i got in a daze while listening it would start to take my mind places. and every single little noise would press a button in my heart and mind and effect me.  that experience led me to hear the rest of the album.  that really was the only track that could be listened to that specific way for me, but the other ones i could get into just as much.  except in different ways.  like National Anthem, its a jam session, with sonic landscapes and distortions and all that.  that was the most extroverted song for me.  Treefingers, i imagine walking with a close friend through the forest and feeling all the living vibrations flow through my soul. my point i think, is that there is no, hehe, 'true' music.  no music is 'truer' than other music.  as Richard Strauss put it:  music is all about &quot;messing with people's heads&quot; something like that at least.  Its all just noise, so if you want to enjoy it then dont use certain criteria to judge how enjoyable it is.  Appreciate it for what it is and not for what it is not. try listening to it all in lots of different settings and moods and times of day and that kind of thing.  there are somethings that you might not like no matter what but i think that if you try the stuff above then those things will be few and far between. I, personally, think that Radiohead are one of the most copied bands out there.  People say that they arnt abstract enough? hehe.  yeah, from a musicians stand point id say F**K YOU.  I do whatever the hell i want and if you gotta proboblem with it then why should i care?  money?  lol, I really care about money, ill write something that you like, ok?  and say its honest and lie to you.  because im perfectly in control of my medium of art.  i can fool with your head however i want.  I write stuff i write for the hell of it.  not for the money.  If i cared about money, i wouldnt be a musician.  So why should I care if you like it or not?  dont even bother voicing your disatisfaction.  I guess you must want all of us musicians to be sell outs and have an 'image' and play a certain 'style' and have 'originality'.  Love it or ignore it.  and to those of you who are openminded if youve read this far, you get to hear me say:  as a musician, i love ya and am thankful to ya.  hehe.  you'll hear about me one day.  *wink* im only sixteen....

B00004W3MS|5.0|This is ablsolutely one of my favorite albums. And it costs that I say this. I had been looking for something totally different, and I have found it. I've been listening to Sigur Ros' Agaetis Byrjun since over a month and its one of those cd's that are constantly around your stereo. Overwhelmed by the voices and phrases of the Intro song, Svefn G Englar is the kind of song that you want to listen to next. And it does. I really don't know what this guy sings but I definitely ended up singing along. The mood, it's mere hope.<br />I have realised with time I had been needing different music, but music with so much feeling. I put this cd and it just takes me away to a place where everything's just calm. And when I want to just fit in a perfect song, Hjartad Hamast is the song. Definitely my favorite. Just buy it. Don't listen to people who complain about a fancy case and drawings. Stick to what's important, finding bands that comply, that will make you know that not everything's invented, that a cello bow can create an atmosphere you will never forget. I'm waiting for translations now. BUt for now I'll just keep singing along. THis is by far one of the best cd's I have ever bought. DOn't. DOn't miss it.

B000002LCK|5.0|Ceremony.  This cd itself is a ceremony. New Order is among my favorite bands and this cd I hold it up high as one of the best in my collection. A perfect balance from the darker sounds of Joy Division and the more pop kinda sounds of the latter New Order. Few cd's hold emotions like this does. My favorites: Ceremony and 1963. I just thought you guys should get all of the Electronic cd's. And leave some room for Republic and Technique, the best New Order cd's after this one. This is the real substance.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Released in 1964, Out to Lunch was the last album relesed during Dolphy's short life. It remains a cornerstone in not just Avant Garde jazz, but in all jazz. From Hat and Beard to Straight Up and Down, there isn't a moment on this album where brilliance isn;t being achieved. Out To Lunch is one of the best and most important albums in jazz history. It is essential.
B00000634L|4.0|What a way to do a really complete album! The only thing I could find myself still dealing with is the lyrics, but this cd is so interesting. I believe the variety of voices and people in this band just adds a lot to the music. My favorite being Drinking in LA of course, but Rain is awesome awesome!  This is just a different cd from what you're used to, and it's good! I must say though I don't like covers in albums of this kind. Give it a try!
B000005H4K|5.0|Money Jungle is one of the most important albums of all time. It is extremely underrated and should get the respect it deserves. This album blends three of the best jazz artists of all time. Max Roach, who is one of the most important jazz drummers of all time, only rivaled by Art Blakey and Chick Webb. Charles Mingus, who is easily the best, most important and most influential bass player of all time. And finally, Duke Ellington, the most important American composer of the 20th century and one of the most brilliant piano players. When these three talents are mixed, the ultimate piano trio is reached. Together, they record 11 of Ellington's most brilliantly arranged compostions, resulting in an incredible album. All of the songs are brilliant, it would not even be worth it to mention individual songs. Money Jungle should be listened to by anybody who is interested in music.
0312954468|5.0|Wilbur Smith is the best storyteller ever. I've read all the Courtney books and then the 4 Ballantyne books and enjoyed many a flight or evening of reading. I recently completed River God and Warlock and these are great writings. Fun, exciting, easy to read. Be sure to read River God before reading Warlock for the greatest enjoyment. Now I'm about to go to Seventh Scroll and if it's half as good as these other two on ancient Egypt I'll be back with a review in a week.
B000002MT0|4.0|From what I understand, this album was more of a contractural obligation for warner, and was released after he changed his name to the symbol (it states on the album cover, &quot;Prince 1958-1993&quot; to signify this).  Even though the purple one may not have thought this album as worthy of release, it's still worth a listen, such is the depth of his talent.  This album greatly reminds me of madonna's 1992 album, &quot;erotica&quot;.  It represents the same dark, aggressive sexual tone that was on &quot;erotica&quot;.  There is also other issues here besides sex, such as the child abuse and suicide displayed on &quot;Papa&quot;.  The title track is an excellent, 11-minute x-rated jam which never becomes dull.  Beware though, This disc is not for everyone, and it's not a disc that's meant to be played out loud. You have to really listen to what he's saying in order to get the most out of it.
B00005B36H|5.0|I must say when I got this CD I was surprised.  As their previous albums have been much more agressive, this one seemed much more mellow.  It worked well.  I assumed the album would turn out this way and was expecting disappointment.  I was surprised how good it turned out.  It is not more of the same Tool; it is completely different than the other albums.  If you are expecting traditional Tool on this album, you might be disappointed.  However, if you are an avid Tool fan like myself, you should already know that they do not consider themselves a hard band. The band was started to express themselves, not to get a record contract, fame, and big bucks. In fact, they were disappointed with Opiate because it was mostly hard songs, and they felt that it gave listeners the wrong idea.  It worked, however, so they stuck with it.  Lateralus is what Tool is all about.  After listening to it a few times you really appreciate the musical genius that Maynard and the rest of the band possess.  Give it a shot.
B00005BL2A|5.0|One of their best albums, comparable with &quot;Violator&quot; and &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;. Each song is a great experience, a delight to listen. My personal favorite is &quot;Shine&quot;, but also &quot;Freelove&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; are wonderful, all of them making a whole, new, futuristic kind of music that only them could've delivered it and it will blow you away. Thank you DM!

B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a great intellectual comedy for anyone with a brain.  The problem is that many people today don't have the patience to sit and watch a good movie.  With great acting and subtle comedy, this movie is sure to impress anyone with an attention span.
6303073107|1.0|Now before you come down on me for my low rating please know that I have a clear understanding of the plot and lesson this movie portrays about mankind. Simply put this movie is 50 minutes too long.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank is a young girl just like a girl today. She has her problems with boys, schools, and maturing. She lives in Netherland. But she and her family are Jewish and must hide from the Nazis. They hide with another family in a secret annex in the back of a wherhouse. They must keep quiet all day and learn to cope with eachother's personality. Every young reader should Read the Diary of Anne Frank. Especially if you are young you will be able to understand how Anne is feeling. IN my mind Anne Frank is a girl genius.

0792844882|4.0|Yes,I agree that the acting leaves something to be be desired but the direction, or rather the editing is good. It has pace. The plot, somewhat disjointed at times holds the interest except for the ending which is [bad]!!! ....The cameo with the struggling dancer/songwriter was underused, a good actor.The dance sequences are strong and I admit to being driven wild by Gershon ... Gershon CAN act.... I do not watch this as often as Casablanca but I enjoy it . It reminds me of mistakes and that life is a fight.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|This is a beautiful film in every sense of the word.  Powerful comedy and drama meet in a world of psychadelic sets and music.  It's the ultimate postmodern movie, combining songs and references from throughout the entire 20th century.  Mr. Luhrman is a genius, though he could have easily cut 1/2 hour from the end.  Overall, though, the film is a masterpiece.  At one point I cried for the sheer fact that there was such an incredible amount of beauty on the screen.  This movie will fill all of your senses.
0679424741|5.0|I was most amazed by how much such a young writer (22 or 23 when she wrote this book) knew about human nature and life in general.<br />McCullers' writing draws the reader into the intimate lives of her characters.  She takes us in to their most personal thoughts and meditations, while still leaving the reader to make up his or her mind if a character &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not.&quot;  Are they or aren't they?  Will they or won't they?  The reader must keep turning the pages to find out.<br />A fascinating read.<br />It's a long time since I've read such an intriguing story.  When I finished &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,&quot; I immediately went to the computer to see what other books McCullers wrote.  I wanted more.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I just saw this movie last night. I ordered it on DVD and it came acouple days early. I wanted to see it soooo bad when it was at the theatre but because of the stupid rating I couldn't. I can't believe that the MPPA is making such a big deal about the sexuality in it. I have seen sexuality of that nature in many other movies. For example \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\", it has much more nudity in it than Requiem, and Eyes Wide was realy bad! This movie is so good that I watched it twice in one night. I was blown away by Ellen Burstyn. I loved her in \\"The Exorcist\\". She is such a good actress, that she is so powerful years later. I think this movie should be seen in High Schools everywhere. I am 15 and this movie is a learning experience. I can't even think of how good this movie is on a big screen. I think that if a parent wants their child to see a movie, than it is up to the parents. The MPPA should ease down on how they rate everything. I am so sick of this. This movie is so GOOD, and I would have loved to see it on a big screen.
0316286850|5.0|KEVYN AUCOIN IS INCREDIBLE.THIS BOOK GIVES EXCELLENT TIPS AND DO IT YOURSELF INSTRUCTIONS.THIS BOOK IS GREAT FOR A WOMAN WANTING TO UPDATE HER LOOK OR EVEN  A MAKEUP GENIUS LIKE KEVYN AUCOIN.THIS AND HIS OTHER BOOKS ARE ABSOLUTLEY A WORK OF ART AND BREATHTAKING TO LOOK AT!!
0451196716|5.0|This is perhaps the most riveting story Stephen King has ever written.  Not the best, but definitly the most shocking.  I've read this book several times and always seem to pick up new things every time I read it.  Errors, of course, are to be found in nearly every book.  Just a couple to keep your eye out for:<br />1)  When Stebbins throws up on day 5, it says he was warned for only the second time since the walk began.  He was actually warned twice before that; once in the first minutes of the walk and the second right after Olsen bought his ticket.<br />2)  A &quot;shifty-eyed&quot; character named Milligan bought it going into Augusta and a Milligan bought it on the last day.  Since he made such a deal about there being two Bakers in the Walk (Art and James), if there were two Milligans, he should have made that distinction as well.<br />I know, I know, I need to get a life.  It still doesn't take anything away from this outstanding read.  Poor Scramm, not realizing that nothing is a sure thing...until the end.  Barkovitch, who is probably a good enough guy, never able to make friends which made the Walk tolerable for those who did.  At first, I was a tad disappointed by the ending, but after reading it a couple of times, it does make sense.  Garrity is walking, then running, towards the dark figure who is death.  He ends up like Reggie Cotter, never able to claim his prize.
B00005AFMT|5.0|If you already have this CD, get it anyway!  The new packaging is pretty cool (like a mini-LP case) with a booklet containing press releases, notes from Robert Fripp and whatnot.  Plus there is a bonus track, Matte Kudasai with some extra guitar.  If you don't have this CD, refer to any other 5 star review.  This is essential King Crimson and belongs in any serious music collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|Like almost everyone else that has reviewed this, i'm a long-time Tool fan. What i'm seeing a lot of, however, is people claiming that this disc isn't as good as Aenima, so they don't give it a high enough rating and then claim that Tool is no longer &quot;prime material.&quot; Now unless someone wants to sit down and do a complete breakdown of every intricacy of the album, we'll assume that the Aenima/Lateralus argument is nothing more than personal opinion.       Lateralus is nothing short of a 5-star rating. Listen to Parabol and then the transition to Parabola. That's deffinantly the most goose-bump inducing moment i've purchased on cd in the past 5 years. If you want catchy ryhthms, try The Grudge, Schism, or Ticks and Leeches. The music in Parabola, Lateralis, and Reflection is every bit as intricate as Aenima. The vocals in Reflection sound very nice.       This is the best thing i've heard in five years, and i've had lots of good stuff. New Radiohead, Mr. Bungle, and Low are some of my favorites, and Tools surpasses them all. Also, don't even compare this to APC. Even Maynard said that A Perfect Circle is &quot;tool for your little sister.&quot; It's basically pop-rock, and it wears thin quickly. Lateralus is art. Buy it, don't download it. These guys worked hard on this, so don't blow it because you're stingy.
044100590X|5.0|This is a lousy sci-fi book. There is no space travel, no robots, practially no aliens, ray guns, space ports or any advanced technology whatsoever. However, it's essentially the best story to fit into just one book I've been fortunate enough to encounter. The plot takes you to a distant world, far separated from us in both time and space, to the home of the Atreides family. They are nobles of some sort and have been comissioned by the Emperor to govern the planet of Arrakis, home of the mysterious spice, a substance with many miraculous traits. From here the book brings you right into the intricate plots surrounding the family Atreides and their adversaries, all surrounded by an environment that speaks more of the middle ages than the future. <br />Well, I would be lying if I didn't admit that every now and then an ornithopter or a las-pistol enters the scene (alright, there _are_ ray guns), but this only serves as a backdrop to the vivid characters of the book, in my opinion the strongest side of the book. I grew attached to them from the first line they appeared and I felt close to them all the way through the story. <br />If you havn't read this book already, I suggest you pick it up right away. I've yet so talk with any litterate person who didn't at least think it a fair read. If you've read it before, Personally, I think I'll schedule it for another reading in a year or so.
0064471837|5.0|I think this book is the type that you never forget (hence the title of this review). It had adventure, humor, romance and everything else a good book should have. It shows death as it has never been shown before, not as heaven or hell but as a river that flows through nine gates. Sabriel is the perfect heroine, she changes all through the book starting as a high school senior who is searching for her father and gradualy becoming the Abhorsen who is defending both the old kingdom and the rest of the world from the dead. The other characters are mysterious, you are never quite sure what Mogget is and you don't find out about Touchstone until later on in the story. I hope you will read this book and enjoy it as much as I did because words to describe how good it is are failing me right now!( make sure you read Lirael daughter of the clayr as well)
B00004T37H|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! The animation is great, the storyline is great, the characters are alive with emotion, and the music is beautiful. I won't tell the story, I'm sure many other's have already. I would recommend it anyone,even if you don't know what anime is, it's a must-see.
B00005B36H|5.0|Definitly worth the wait.  I've been a TOOL fan since the opiate days, and have to say that TOOL is God.  The day I bought this album I went camping and played this album while stareing at the fire all night.   The band has evolved so much but they still retain their uniqueness that makes them who they are.  This album will take you to another demension so I suggest taking the time to sit back and devote your complete attention to the Reverand and see why TOOL fans call them GOD!  If you buy this album even as a new TOOL listener I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
0375751467|5.0|The Theories of Natural Selection and Survival of the Fittest have been misquoted and misused nearly as often as certain Biblical passages. Rather than take another person's word for what Darwin meant by Evolution through Natural Selection, I opted to go straight to the source. I was not disappointed. Darwin's rich array of facts and furthering evidence was almost overwhelming, and yet he yields a long list of resources by which one can attempt to disprove his conclusions. Darwin is a true &quot;Truth&quot; seeker and does not seem driven to merely further his own theory by any means necessary. Read &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Read the Bible. Draw your own conclusions. You owe it to yourself.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Depeche Mode was the first band I listened following my own tastes, and for more than 8 years I almost exclusively bought and listened to DM albums. Now (I really mean for the last 4 or 5 years) I prefer to listen to other bands: Skinny Puppy, Front 242... However, there will always be a place in my heart for the band which has made me feel better (and also worse, sadder) in my life. Ok, now you have swallowed all this boring preamble, I'll talk a bit about Exciter. It seems to me that since Alan Wilder departed the songs are smoother and quieter than before. In Exciter I find some good songs, such as 'Dream on', 'Shine', 'The sweetest condition', 'The dead of night'...(which, by the way, I can't understand what does this song have to do with Nine inch Nails: no better no worse, but very little to do, really)  But I really miss some danceable song; well, not exactly danceable, but songs with more powerful, such as older 'Never let me down again', 'higher love', 'Walking in my shoes' or 'Policy of truth'... here even the most powerful ones, 'maybe 'The dead of night' or 'I feel Loved' are always moody... Dave Gahan's voice sounds interesting as ever... but he stmes sings like Gore, as he did in 'waiting for the night', which was ok for one song in a cd, but here almost every song is sung in that ballad-like style... what has surprised me more is that i thought the band would follow a more guitaristic path, such as in 'Ultra', but Exciter is more electronic than Ultra (fortunately, country guitars are absent here) , and the sounds used are quite good; except for the percussion, which always sounds low, slow and without power... sorry, but power has been repeated 3 times, but it's exactly what the last 2 DM albums lack. To sum up: DM is still capable to present good songs but they are all much alike and quiet... almost all the songs are ballads, and some of them (especially 'Comatose' and 'Goodnight Lovers') are much too edulcorated and Somebody-esque. Exciter is not abad album, but DM's peak took place many years ago (especially from 1986 to 1993) and now it seems to me that they are unable to surprise a lot.
0671027344|5.0|I read the whole book in one evening I just could not put it down.  I was instantly hooked to the boy who was an outcast, but found somewhere to fit in.  he reminded me so much of my own younger brother that it really made the whole story so much more real.  It was just a great read.
B00003CWN2|5.0|This is a very well-made and thought-provoking movie whose depth and intensity could never be reproduced by Big-Hollywood studios.  That is one of the plusses of independent movies, they can take alternative approaches and risks with the film direction that would never see the light of day in the well-established, tried-and-true, set-in-stone methods of Hollywood filmmaking.       This is not a movie for the squeamish.  The film is very graphic in several ways. The love scene between Swank and Sevigny is pretty eye-opening and adds tremendously to the film's stark realism, a realism which made this film so effective and memorable, and adds so much weight to the final scene that hits you like a sledgehammer. Once Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon's true identity is discovered, her situation deteriorates rapidly and what follows gets pretty hard to watch, and the images will not soon leave your mind.  After watching the film I felt similar to how I felt after watching &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot; - it was a good movie that needs to be seen, but I didn't want to watch it a second time.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Trouble in Shangri-La, Stevie Nicks' seventh solo album brings the singer-song writer full circle. Stevie goes from the highs and lows of fame dealt with in Bella Donna to the reconcilliation of those highs and lows in her new CD. The title of Stevie's new CD, Trouble in Shangri-La will cause those who just don't &quot;get Stevie&quot; to shrug and say there she goes again! Airy Fairy, 53 year old Stevie singing about love lost and found and using the hot young stars of today: Macy Gray, Natalie Maines, and Sheryl Crow among others to sell records. If you buy into this attitude, you will be depriving yourself of Rock perfection! Stevie is a true Rock survivor with a lot to say. Anyone, be they male or female will find something to relate to on this CD. Be it the professional doubts of That Made Me Stronger, where Stevie wonders if she is still capable of being a viable songwriter, to the haunting &quot;Miss You&quot; where she sings, &quot;I have so many questions about love, about hate, about strained relationships...&quot; <br />This is a CD for both die hard fans who know her entire life story and can recite VH-1's Behind The Music by heart, and the newcomers: Sheryl Crow fans perhaps, who are in for the treat of a life time from rock and roll's Jill of all Trades!
0812589041|5.0|As classic Hero's Journey, &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is one of the ten best science fiction stories of the twentieth century. It uncannily predicted the Internet and personal computers many years ahead of time. The story is both tense and sparse yet gripping from almost the first page. Card is a writer of immense power and this seemingly grim story of a boy conceived and brought up to be a leader and fighting machine is a bright tapestry about determination, loyalty, and bravery. This story is the beginning of the &quot;Ender&quot; saga, but very different from the other books in the series. I have read it many times and never get tired of it.

6305524866|5.0|I really laughed at this one.  Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's story line is hilarious, but I was really moved by the touching portrayals of the unconventional couple and other minor characters.  A extremely pleasurable film! There are some flaws: I'm not a great fan of either Kristen Scott-Thomas or Andie, but they passed muster in this one.  The wry sense of humor that prevails more than makes up for a couple of silly lines. All in all, though, the story kept it going...I'm still smiling!<br />Grade: excellent!
015650300X|5.0|This is a wonderful story, with many levels, that can be enjoyed by anyone who is willing to take the time to read it, let it sink in, and think about what it says.  Interesting insights into life and relationships.  Like a lot of other reviewers here, I first read the French version as part of a French class, but I've re-read it several times since then, both the French and English versions.  If you read French, I recommend the French version.  If you don't read French, check out the English version.  It always leaves me smiling.<br />&quot;Voici mon secret. Il est tr&egrave;s simple: on ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.&quot;
1577311523|5.0|It's interesting how the &quot;right&quot; book always seems to appear when I can most use the message.  As I was tossing between the past and the future, this gentle man says &quot;be here now.&quot;  Clear, compassionate, and compelling.
0790743221|5.0|This is a delightful romantic comedy about the life and loves of a high society girl.  Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is about to be married to George Kittredge (John Howard), a self made man who elevated himself from the lower class.  The wedding is supposed to be a private affair, but Tracy's ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) blackmails her into letting two reporters, Macaulay Conner and Elizabeth Imbrie (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey) cover the event.  What ensues is a screwball courtship for the heart of Tracy as everyone falls in love with her at once.<br />Director David Cukor (\\"Little Women\\", \\"My Fair Lady\\") provides a fast paced comedy with rapid-fire repartee and fosters a bubbly chemistry between the cast members, which brims with laughs.  Cukor received one of his five Oscar nominations for this film and it was well deserved.<br />Katharine Hepburn is marvelous as the blueblood bride to be.  She is a well-grounded girl who is not beyond putting on airs for show.  She is simultaneously sassy and dreamy and her comic timing is superb earning her one of twelve nominations for best actress.  Despite a star's billing, Cary Grant plays a supporting role as the sarcastic Dexter Haven.  With his deadpan delivery, he provides the perfect foil to Hepburn and Stewart.<br />Even with the luminous cast, Jimmy Stewart steals the show with a comedic tour de force.  His inebriated scene with Cary Grant is uproariously funny and his puppy dog wooing of Katherine Hepburn is enchanting.  It is hard to believe that James Stewart only won one Oscar in his outstanding career.  Though nominated five times, the only role for which he won the statue is this one, a performance that is unquestionably among his best.<br />This tremendous comedy brings together three screen legends at the peak of their careers.  It was nominated for six Academy Awards winning two, and it was rated #51 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  It is a timeless classic that is sure to please.  I ratedit a 10/10.  See it and enjoy.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I think this album is pretty decent, DM is trying to take us for a ride in diffrent direction and I think some of us weren't quite ready. I was actually hoping for Ultra part 2. Dream On is a perfect single to introduce us to their new sound, my problem is a few of the songs sound similiar and a bit boring, but then you listen to songs like the catchy I feel loved and the beautiful Free love-( which by the way should be their next single) that you can't help but think they are back.     This cd is worth having in your record collection but I am already anticipating the next Depeche Mode Album:)
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this on the insistance of a friend. He had recommended Siamese Dreams-Smashing Pumpkins years earlier, so I figured he can't be that far off. He issued the warning that it takes a few listens before you get it and blah blah bah. So I tried to get through it a few times really only appreciating the first tracks bass line which is relatively complex in its rhythm. I then went onto shelve it for a month while purchasing the Bends around the same time. I immediately loved the Bends but thought OKC was mediocre at best. Then one rainy day, four or five months later, I picked up OKC and listened again. And I thought it was good. Kid A came out at that time-I'm late on the Radiohead fan club band wagon- and I love that immediately. But I am slowly warming to OKC at that time. I find myself now listening to OKC more than the Bends or Pablo Honey, and on equal listening status with KidA. These Cds(OKC and KidA)are multileveled works which take time to appreciate. Many compare Radiohead to Pink Floyd which I can only attribute as to their conceptual artitstic work belief. Musically this band has taken rock/alternative to another level that only has been achieved by artist like the afore mentioned Pink Floyd, U2, and NIN. They have pushed the envelope to the next evolution which incorporates jazz, techno, new age, and rock. OKC is the first of the new incarnation and KidA is the second. It may take another year to review Amnesiac to truly appreciate it's greatness like OKC and KidA.
0451169514|5.0|It is imposible to try to evaluate the works of the master of American Fiction, Stephen King, with out looking at his crown achievment &quot;IT&quot;.<br />His ability to introduce a reader from childhood, to the every moment of innocent love, fear, bravery, trust and ultimatly friendship' must rate as his ultimate literay achievement.<br />To any new comers, think 'Stand by Me' meets frankinstein, Dracula, the Mummy and every nightmare a child will have.<br />King has a love for Maine, his home turf, and the fact that his home ground has such a bearing on his best yarns makes Derry, Maine, a hell of a town to be a clown. True or NOT?
B00005BL2A|5.0|I'm not surprised of this album. Exciter, is the best album of the new millenium, naturally, and that's because it was made by the best band of the last 20 years: DEPECHE MODE. Some people may think this is a boring album, but we've got to think about something: Neither Martin, nor Dave and Andrew are on their 20's, they have passed through 20 years of good music,and now they are older. But their music is always something new, even though is so deeply longing, and the voice of Dave is the best, only after the lyrics he sings.  There are other bands that are made the best bands of the world  (U2)but they are no longer making good music, in fact they only repeat the same formula, and aren't creative. Others, REM, for example, are good, but they're are not as good as Depeche Mode. This album is not better than Ultra, is different and quiet. The best song? Breath, sung by Martin, and there are other jewels on this: Shine, When the body speaks, Freelove and the beautiful Good night Lovers. As I said before,I'm not surprised, this is another excellent album, another cult album for all the Fans, and in the past were the biggest bands of all the time: The Beatles, Led Zepellin,Pink Floyd, Queen, and now, Depeche Mode. Wellcome! Trully a time to celebrate, if you like good music, dont hesitate, and get it, its a classic album. Long live Depeche Mode!
0385484518|1.0|Where to begin?  As pointed out by other reviewers, this book is sappy, sentimental, trite, and thoroughly unoriginal.  These points are made effectively by many of the &quot;one-star&quot; reviewers below.<br />I will add the following:<br />First, I am skeptical of many of the &quot;truths&quot; expressed in this book.  Funny how the guy who is suggesting that &quot;money isn't everything&quot; is a tenured professor at a top school, living in Boston's wealthiest suburb, surrounded by private nurses and the latest medical equipment.  For the rest of us, money is important.  Maybe not the most important thing, but it's important.  Personally, I take a lot of satisfaction from working fairly hard and making money to feed, clothe, and house my family.   Sue me.<br />Second, I suspect that Mitch Albom is a liar.  I don't find it credible that he had the relationship Morrie that he claims to have had.  And I don't think that Morrie is the saint that Albom makes him out to be.  More credible is that this book was just a money-making and attention-grabbing scam on the part of Albom (and possibly Morrie).  (Yes, I'm speculating here)<br />Finally, since Albom has been thoroughly trashed in other reviews, I want to take a shot at Morrie.  We've all known teachers, coaches, etc. who are very good at dispensing platitudes in a profound manner.  Invariably, all the students think that teacher is &quot;so cool&quot; or whatever.  And these self-promoting windbags are usually sleeping with the prettiest girls in the class who are so touched by this &quot;wisdom.&quot;  Is Morrie from this mold?  I don't know, but from reading &quot;tuesdays,&quot; I have my suspicions.
B00003CWOL|4.0|Great movie, I adored it's plot, but it doesn't fit with the rest of his movies, except for jay and silent bob, I know that this is no reason to hate a movie, but in this case, the name Kevin Smith means anti-streamlined, and this was way to streamlined, it doesn't matter, it's still impressive, I never tell any part of the story, because it means you already know about the movies, all I can say is it's good, but not up to par with his other movies.  George Carlin is great as he plays a bishop. &quot;I am 15 but I should not be questioned because of my age but because of my thoughts.&quot;
B00005ATZT|5.0|It was bad enough to see CBS pull the plug on the great CBS remake, however you can always go back and see the movie that was the 93 summer blockbuster. Though Harrison Ford will never be David Jansssen, Ford played a better Fugitive than a president. The movie is not only suspenseful but is a great mystery film.
B00004T9UF|5.0|hey whaz up? this CD is so tight!!! you got to get it!! I dont care what anyone else says about it! and I hate anyone that dosent like Eminem!!! this CD is realy cool and so are all of the others so you got to get all of them!!!!!!!!
B000003TAW|5.0|&quot;Weezer&quot; is Weezer's finest work to date-- it has something that their other two albums (Pinkerton and &quot;The Green Album&quot;) are lacking. The songs on the self-titled debut are fresher, more raw and more consistently good than the songs on the other two. Almost everybody can hum the tune to &quot;Undone (The Sweater Song)&quot; or &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; (&quot;wo-eeh-oh I look just like Buddy Holly, uh-oh you look just like Mary Tyler Moore... I can never get this one out of my head), but I think that every song on this CD is great and worth listening to over and over (I've been listening to it for years, and I'm still not sick of it!) My favorite tracks are &quot;No One Else&quot;, &quot;The World Has Turned and Left me Here&quot;, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;Undone (The Sweater Song)&quot;, &quot;Say it Ain't So&quot;, and &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;. The songs are a variety of fast-paced garage-rock and slower, simple songs-- each one takes a different turn from the last. Even though this CD came out in the whole grunge period, it still holds its own today, and I think it will for a long, long time to come.
B000002MP2|5.0|The best (or worst) thing that ever happend to Green Day.  An incredible disk, that sounds like a bunch of winey kids, which is exactly how it's supposed to sound, for anyone who's ever likes Green Day or any other punk-sounding group.   &quot;I am 15 but I should not be questioned because of my age but because of my thoughts.&quot;

B00005BL2A|4.0|Before you listen to this CD, you have to throw all your expectations out the window. The music on this CD is very different from their previous stuff. A lot of it is slow. Many tracks do not have catchy and  accessible melodies. In fact, most people will probably hate this CD at first as I did. But you have to give it a chance and listen to it with an open mind. The fast tracks have rough, powerful energy, while the slow tracks are very relaxing.  This CD will certainly divide the listeners. Some  will call it a masterpiece; some will hate it. I guess the truth  lies somewhere in the middle.
076780421X|4.0|If you like &quot;Friends&quot;, I am pretty sure you will like this movie. It is funny and full of charms. Salma Hayek is hot. The DVD is OK with good picture quality. The Dolby 5.1 does not have much to offer as most of the movie is funny dialogue anyway. Get this DVD, definetely a keeper.
B00004VVNB|3.0|LOGAN'S RUN is a mediocre movie, but, surprisingly, a pretty good DVD with a sizable amount of extras. The picture isnt bad, but it isnt great; same goes for the sound. The first extra feature is the theatrical trailer. I always love to see vintage trailers, so this extra is nice. The next extra feature is a short documentary, entitled A LOOK INTO THE 23RD CENTURY. This documentary gives a fair amount of insight into the making of the film, and is worth watching. The best extra on this DVD is the feature length commentary by director, Michael Anderson; actor, Michael York and costume designer, Bill Thomas. These three men collaborate for a wonderfully revealing and compelling commentary. The price of the DVD is worth it, just for this commentary alone.
B0000085N4|5.0|When I bought my first CD player in 1990, Sonic Temple was the first disc I bought. All these years later, The Cult is still one of the greatest (and most underappreciated) acts in modern music history.<br />The Cult -- and especially the album Sonic Temple -- are quality. They're the real deal. Tracks like Edie (Ciao Baby), Sweet Soul Sister and American Horse deserve to be modern classics. There were a thousand &quot;hard rock&quot; acts in the '80s but few if any produced real music that will stand the test of time and the scrutiny of educated music lovers.<br />While Guns 'N' Roses and Motley Crue can today be clearly seen as the adolescent lightweights they always were, The Cult has aged well. In hindsight, it is clear that The Cult were always more mature, more spiritual and far deeper musically than other '80s acts of the same genre. The Cult is destined to be remembered as one of the great hard rock acts along with the likes of Zeppein, Steppenwolf, The Doors, and [more recently] The Black Crowes and Soundgarden.
B00004SZWD|4.0|&quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; is truly Stevie Wonder's opus.  It is hard to imagine this, having already fallen in love with  &quot;Talking Book&quot; and &quot;Innervisions.&quot;  Many, including myself, consider it to be the greatest pop album ever recorded.  It is just about the most magnificent, wide-ranging and deeply moving recording I've ever heard.  This record truly displays the depth and integrity of Stevie's gifts as a composer, instrumentalist, vocalist and producer.  His choice of musicians on this record (including Herbie Hancock, George Benson, and Greg Phillangaines) is of course top-notch.  Musically and artistically it is a masterpiece on every conceivable level.  However, I am saying all of this of the original recording, not the one you see here.<br />I have been trying for some time now to dispell the notion that digital remastering somehow enhances the quality of an older record.  I have heard remasters that were excellent, and I think for recordings of the 1950's and 60's vintage they can improve the overall fidelity of early stereo.  However, Stevie's albums in the early and mid 70's were also masterpieces of recording technology.  I have such fond memories of hearing this record on LP and being so entranced by the warmth and intimacy of the sound.  Analog masters sound as though the musicians are with you in the room! Many new recordings lack this quality, sounding sterile and reproduced.  I was greatly disappointed with this particular remaster, as well as all of the Stevie Wonder remasters that were recently released by Motown.  It sounds to me as if someone simply compressed all of the waves and then cranked up the treble about a hundred notches.  Some of the cymbal crashes on this record left my ears ringing, I can't understand why so many people prefer to listen to this.  <br />Having come of age after the advent of CDs, I feel I am being as objective as one can be. I think this is not simply an issue of preference, or analog vs. digital. I think this about preserving and respecting the original 'voice' of the record.  Stevie Wonder, in addition to all of his musical accomplisments, was a master producer.  He knew what he wanted to hear, and when I listen to the original recording I am so stimulated by the entire sonic experience.  There are textures and nuances in many of the layers (especially the intricate bass lines and synth work) that have been obscured by the high frequency, high compression sound format that has somehow become the standard.  I am afraid that the fascination with technological advancement has superceded the pure listening experience, and it's disappointing.  <br />Nevertheless, the music speaks for itself.  I would only advise that those who wish to hear the album how it was intended to be heard in 1976 buy the original.
B000000WA4|5.0|...this is theatre.<br />There are tons of artists and albums which are great simply because they do the rock and roll thing so very well. But every so often one encounters a work which can't be called rock because the term &quot;rock&quot; feels so small, so inadequate by comparison. Mellen Collie and the Infinite Sadness is one of these works. Mellen Colle and the Infinite Sadness is so above and beyond any definition of &quot;music&quot; in the traditional sense that to call it rock, prog rock, art rock, whatever -- is just unfair.<br />In one fell swoop, Smashing Pumkins transcend nearly all genres and demonstrate just how many &quot;pretenders&quot; are out there in today's musical vacuum. Tracks like Zero and Bullet with Butterfly Wings make bands like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson seem adolescent and antiseptic. Staggeringly loud, symphonic and beautiful tracks like Tonight, Tonight and Thru the Eyes of Ruby give the listener some sense of what Beethoven might have done with modern equipment in a commercial world. There are amazing tracks here for new wavers, hard rockers, pop-lovers, metalheads... Even the new agers and the folk music crowd have to turn their heads and pay attention for unclassifyable tracks like Lily (My One and Only) and Thirty-Three.<br />I own hundreds of discs and like many of them very well, but it's hard to think of any other album which supercedes this one either in terms of quality or of scope. Many artists have tried their hand at projects this big, this ambitious, but I can't think of any other artist in any decade, '60s, '70s, '80s or '90s, who really delivered on the promise of such big ideas. Mellen Collie and the Infinite Sadness is truly one of the great musical statements of all time, in any genre.<br />Mellen Collie and the Infinite Sadness isn't music -- it's theater. Listening to this album, you can almose *see* the sound and the fury around you and feel the tiny notes and immense chords crawl up your neck and down your spine. Truly an experience not to be missed.our spine. Truly an experience not to be missed.
B000001ABD|1.0|Being a die-hard Stevie fan, I never thought I would be saying this: I can't believe I actually bought this.  &quot;Song Review&quot; is possibly the lamest, poorly representative compilation I have ever heard of any artist's material.  I could go on for days about all the great songs that are curiously absent in this collection, but I won't. I trust that people who know Stevie Wonder's music are hip enough to realize that this album is simply not Stevie's greatest hits. The most concise statement I could make about the play list is to say that there is a general lack of attention to Stevie's greatest albums- &quot;Talking Book&quot;, &quot;Innervisions&quot;, &quot;Fulfillingness' First Finale&quot; and &quot;Songs in the Key of Life.&quot;  I find the neglect of this ingenious music deeply disturbing, I can't understand how anyone in his/her right mind could dedicate almost the entire second disc to Stevie's least memorable material.  Beginning the compilation with &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot; and &quot;I Just Called . .&quot; was a very poor call, it's just that simple.  I don't buy these &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collections to begin with, I can thank Motown for reminding me why I don't. After hearing this disgrace I refuse to ever buy one again.<br />It is widely acknowledged that Stevie's creative peak occured between 1972 and 1976, when he recorded four of the greatest albums in the history of pop. This is not to slight the beauty of later songs such as &quot;Overjoyed&quot; or &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot; because they certainly have their place here. However, my advice to a Stevie novice would be to buy &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;-here you will actually hear Stevie Wonder.  I am not trying to sound like and old and bitter purist- I grew up in the 80's, but I'm not an idiot. I know what grooves and what puts me to sleep.  <br />In summary, this collection is not recommended for anyone with good musical sensibilities.
6304500483|4.0|this movie is actually a pretty good one. i remember the first time i saw this. i was in 7th grade and hated it. then in my junior year of highschool i rented the original crow and loved it. i then set out to rent this and i have to tell you now that ive seen it a lot of times, i think it surpasses the original. this movie is acquired taste(none of my friends like it but me) i think they did a great job of picking villians for this film-very sleazy. and the sets are great, in the first crow film the sets were just very dark which was cool, but in this one, some sets are dark and some have very colorful skys and backgrounds and great lighting. all in all this was a good film, much better after you have seen it a couple of times!
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink 182 realeased Enema of the state back in 1999 along with the singles &quot;all the small things&quot; and &quot;whats my age again&quot; which brought got the attention that they have deserved for the last six years. Having heard their other albums i would say it s arguably their best. The riffs and basslines are relly catchy and the drumming is just amazing. Enama of the stste is a good bit faster than the other albums and a lot catchier hance it is often dascribed as pop/punk. The lyrics are funny and you a lot of people find it hard to talk blink 182 seriosly and can,t really picture them as talented musicians, but they are....
630157401X|5.0|i cant believe it. i dont see how someone can make three movies with the same character and keep them as original and great as the very first time we saw indie. but speilberg did it. this movie like raiders and temple is great all three indiana jones movies are my three favorite movies of all time. this is my second fav in the series. sean connery and harrison ford make a great on screen duo- irresistable to me. this movie has what all the other three have-action/adventure, comedy, suspense and romance. this one is definately the most comedic one of the batch.  this time ol' indie (or junior as connery calls him)is going after the holy grail. great boobie traps, action, and laughs fill up the screen. dont delay pick this masterpeice up ASAP!!!
B000002MP2|5.0|Arguably Green days best album. If you are new to the amazing world of Green day, i would recommend this as your first purchase.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Adam Cooper clearly is at his best and sets himself as totally elite from rest of the dances with his inspiring performance.  Every move is completed with perfection and all are carried through to their finality.  Wonderful!
0881030856|4.0|This novel is not only a fable, but it's an entertaining and unususal read as well. It took me a bit to get used to the fact that rabbits aren't being personified as people but are actually treated as rabbits. Although I was able to enjoy the book more as I got to know the characters.<br />The interweaving of history and mystics with an exciting story made the last 200 pages go quickly. The fact that these are rabbits gives leeway to make a story that would not be a typical tale of human struggle, but also goes to show the differences in the way people have progressed and nature has remained true to its own way of being.<br />Another remarkable thing is that even though there are hardships in the story, it left me feeling uplifted at the end. It just seems so rare in contemporary literature to be left with such a clean feeling. I appreciate that.<br />The details which may seem tedious at points are also startling. Things which may be taken for granted are highlighted and used well. For example, the height of a rabbit as opposed to that of a person comes into play. When the group comes upon a new area they can't simply take a few steps and look around and decide it's okay. There are pages of exploration over just a few hundred feet.<br />I think this would be a good first book for any adolescent to read. It tends to leave a good mark on the brain.
B00005B36H|2.0|Sorry folks, but I'm gonna buck the trend here of dishing out 4 or 5 stars for this album...Some people may think that a slicker, more polished album equals a better album, but I don't agree. What makes Tool an awesome band is that their music to this point was raw and rough around the edges. Lateralus isn't, and in this context it very much reminds me of Metallica getting all smoothed out with &quot;Metallica&quot;.<br />Maynards' voice is more melodic, or &quot;better&quot; as many here have put it, but in my opinion, this detracts from the album. Largely missing from Maynard's voice and delivery on Lateralus is the moodiness, despair and raw emotion demonstrated on Undertow and Aenima.<br />Lyrically, much of the contempt for and commentary about society from the previous albums is also gone...A more mellow Maynard isn't necessarily a better one, and a toned down Tool is just that..Toned down. Slow or hard isn't the issue here...Some of Tool's best songs from Undertow and Aenima are the quietly eerie tracks.<br />In total, too many of the songs on Lateralus sound the same, making quite a few tracks indistinguishable from one and other...It is formulaic to the point that is predictable, lacking the twists and turns present in their previous work.<br />I've listened to this album at least 15 times by now, waiting for it to grow on me, but it hasn't...Undertow and Aenima required no repeated listening to get used to them, they jumped right out and hit you immediately as amazing creations. <br />Lateralus, for the most part, lacks that which made Tool the single most unique band going since the day Undertow was released.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Gimme Shelter has a very dark ora that surrounds the film. It has a creepy feeling to the film. Mick Jagger is punched in the face in the beginning as he makes his entrance. During the Jefferson Airplane's performance, Marty Balin is knocked out by one of the Hell's Angels. And a spectator is beaten to death by bikers with pool sticks. A black spectator is stabbed to death and it is caught on camera. The Rolling Stones have to stop their performance numerous times to try to stop the violence. Besides the violence and death, this is the best concert film ever made Hands Down! This masterpiece deserves to be seen by everyone. It also serves as a reminder of the greatest concert tragedies in the history of rock n' roll.
B00000IAU3|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Here With Me&quot; on the radio, I was amazed. It's the sort of song that stays with you for a long, long time-haunting, evokative and almost chilling. This is one of the songs the 1990s will be remembered for.     One of my other favorites on this CD was &quot;My Love has Gone.&quot; The ambiguity and simplicity of the lyrics give this song an ageless quality. It has a celtic feel to it, reminiscent of Lorena McKennit.      A few of the other songs seemed a bit bland when compared to  &quot;Here With Me&quot;, but overall, this CD was very satisfying. I've owned it for almost a year and still listen to it frequently. I hope Dido plans on making another album. I'll be looking for it.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles at this time were fragmenting as we all know; but for one more remarkable moment they showed the world that they intended to go out on top. This was their final musical statement and what a statement it was. They put out what could very well be the finest album ever. For one last time all their influences and ideas were put together in what was certainly their most cohesive and structured effort. Abbey Road is also aided by George Martin's lush production. McCartney is at his absolute zenith on what was then side two of the record. His contributions are nothing short of extraordinary in what is a virtual symphony of sound. Aided by Lennon's vertigo of words in Come Together and Harrison's finest two songs of his career, Here Comes the Sun and Something and you have the Beatles at their peak. Vocally, this is easily there finest effort. The song Because is certainly the highlight of this, with absolutely gorgeous three way harmony. With the exception of The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds this is the best album vocally I have ever heard. Unlike Sgt. Pepper, This album will sound as fresh 100 years from now as it did in 1969. It is timeless.
0920668372|5.0|My sister found this book when both of our children were grown and we did not yet have Grandchildren .  Once I read it I had to buy it for my grown children.  This book is not only for the young, but anyone with children of any age.  I have bought it for friends and everyone loves it.  I now have Grandchildren and everytime they come over we have to read it.  I still can't get all the way throught it without a tear.
B000002I6T|5.0|Not many people have heard this album. It originally came out in 1971. It really showcases David Crosby as the slightly off center balladeer. This album is very spacy and dreamlike, with a celtic twist to it. No one really sounds like Crosby. He has a beautiful vocal range and a wonderful talent for sweetness, but with a psychedelic, haunting feel to it. He never sounds poppy. He is aided by multilple guest stars including Neil Young and Graham Nash. Crosby has probably never obtained the level of songwriting and musicianship that he obtained on this album. Highlights include the first cut with Neil Young, the very catchy, Music is Love and the lovely and lush, Traction In the Rain. This very well could be one of my desert Island cds, it's that good.
B000009DUY|5.0|I love John Williams' music especially his earlier work, because I think it is more powerful and dynamic. That has been replaced by more softer tunes over the years... And this soundtrack is a brilliant example, it's subtle, it's soothing and very moving as is the film.<br />And it helps you remember the many people who died on those cold beaches, so that we are able to sit here today without being screened and registered by the Gestapo.<br />So listen, remember... and enjoy living...
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie was very nice.  I liked it a lot, and I recommend it for anyone who likes movies.  It is nice.
B000005RS6|5.0|When i looked at the list of songs on this set,and being it had steve morse on guitar i had to have it.And im glad i did.This is a great collection of songs from a great band.Ian gillian is in great form,and steve morse just cooks on guitar.I think my favorite song on this double cd set is the great song sometimes i feel like screaming.This is a must have for any deep purple fan.
B000059Z8J|5.0|A young boy is sent away from his doomed home planet Krypton to live life in earths protective atmosphere which also happens to give him special powers. We all know what follows in Richard Donner's three act masterpiece, a visual effects feast with a clutch of magnificent actors, a great story and of course unbelievable cinematography, art direction, sound and THAT score from John Williams! Although some of the effects were naturally going to be dated after such a long time, this is still the treat it was and the fantastic features esp. seeing the actors testing for the roles, set it all off.  What a DVD! One of the best!
B000007T1M|1.0|My friend and I have similar tastes in music (Staind, Static-X, Godsmack, etc.), so I was pretty happy when he reccommended this alum to me. To be frank, I couldn't even listen to the entire album--This isn't music; it's noise...Aggravating, disturbing, and infuriating noise...Stay away from this garbage. I gave it one star only bacaue I can't give it a zero.
B00005BL2A|4.0|My first listen to this album found me a bit underwhelmed...Where, oh where, I asked myself, were the rushing, full on sonic assaults that were such classics as &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;A Question of Time&quot; and &quot;People are People&quot;?  I honestly at first thought DM had slept through this entire album.  Listening to it a few more times, however, I found the clarity beneath the seemingly dormant surface.<br />From the opening &quot;Dream On&quot;, which gets things going nicely, to the soft closer &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot;, Exciter is a solid work.....The best tracks aside from dream on are &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot;, &quot;When The Body Speajks&quot;, and &quot;Free Love&quot;.  Not to say the rest are bad, but the ones just mentioned are the real gems.  Throughout this album, the mood is defnitely subdued, but the musicianship and lyrical talents that have always been Depeche Mode's hallmark manage to shine through.  As much as I may have said I would have liked to hear something like their older songs, that would be listening to music in the same narrow-minded way as the very kind of person I try not to be when listening to music:  To put it simply: Like them for what they do, not the classics they didn't rehash.  Appreciate musical growth and change, and embrace it, rather than seeing it as the doom of a band.  Yes, this album has its so-so and not-so-great cuts (&quot;The Dead of Night&quot;, and the two instrumental cuts), but is still a solid work, worthy of your purchase.
B00003CXA2|5.0|let me start off by saying that i was glad to hear that this movie is FINALLY coming out on dvd and IT'S ABOUT TIME!<br />this is one of the best movies ever made,in my opinion and it deserves a place in every one's collection.<br />i first saw it at the movies 3 months after it had been released,and what suprised me when i walked in there was that after those three months of release,the theater was STILL packed!<br />i only hope that all the other studios get off their rear ends and put out all the other great films out on dvd:like the godfather series,the star wars films,grease,the back to the future series...the list goes on<br />so,get moving movie studios...we movie collectors want these movies on dvd!!
630281474X|5.0|now, 43 years later, it is still at the top of my list as one of the best Dracula movies of all time.  True, it does deviate from Bram Stoker's novel quite a bit, but nothing is lost in the telling.<br />As a twelve year old boy, in 1958, I remember well sitting in the dark of my home town movie theater waiting for this movie to start.  I watched as Jonathon Harker walks to the castle to start work for the Count as his librarian.  Gradually, the movie progresses to Harker's looking around a seemingly deserted castle and finding his supper waiting for him on a table in the Great Room.  Suddenly, as he is eating, he knocks some flatware off of the table and notices a woman behind the door.  She begs him to help her escape from the evil castle.  Next, she nuzzles up to the old boy, looks up at him. She then bares her teeth, and goes right for his old jugular vein.  <br />At this time, I realized that this was unlike any other vampire movie I had ever seen.  Next, a door flies open, and there is Chris Lee; eyes bloodshot, and baring the longest, bloodiest fangs I've ever seen.  Let me tell you: I found out, at that moment, just what getting the [heck] scared out of you meant.<br />Still today, this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.  None of the sequels ever measured up to it, and I am deeply disappointed that the powers-that-be chose to come out with some of the lesser sequels, on DVD, and not this one.  This is a crime, and I hope that it is corrected in the very near future.<br />BUY THIS [MOVIE]!!   EVEN IN VHS FORM,  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!
B000002UUX|4.0|This was Megadeth's fourth album and the first with Nick and Marty.  This album has got some killer track like Holy Wars.. The Punishment Due with those great solos and the spanish guitars as well as Dave's insane Lyrics(Just because I ain't sayin it don't mean I ain't thinkin it).  This album has some great tunes like Lucretia, Tornado of Souls and Hangar 18 but the rest isin't that great.  I mean these songs reall stand out and hold the album together.  Dawn Patrol is a really keul song at first but you get tired of it after hearing it some many times not the case with the other ones I mentioned.  Marty Friedman is an amazing guitarist.  He and Dave were one of the most dangerous twin shreders out there.  Although this album isin't as great as Peace sells or So far so good... it's still a great album.  It's a change of pass as the band survived the transition into the 90's (Metallica wasn't so lucky heh heh).  Dave's voice while not the best is alright on this album I mean there are times when I think he sounds great.  Before you buy this buy in the following order : 1. Peace sells 2. So fra so good so what 3. Rust in Peace.  DAVE U ROCK TIMES 2!
B00005B36H|4.0|I can't say I like this album more than &quot;AEnima&quot;, but it does blow their earlier releases &quot;Opiate&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot; out of the water. &quot;Lateralus&quot; is a truely beautiful album, but this is where it is lacking: 1996's &quot;AEnima&quot; was a near perfect album. The majority of the songs on &quot;AEnima&quot; where listenable, while compared to &quot;Lateralus&quot;, much of the songs are worth hitting the skip button and some of them feel as they drag on a bit much. The album starts out with the totally awesome and dark &quot;The Grudge.&quot; I figured it was gonna be the best on the album, but that wasn't until I heard the third track &quot;The Patient.&quot; Probably the best Tool song ever. That song just totally blew me away when I first heard it. Unbelieveable song. Followed after a filler track, there is the single &quot;Schism&quot; which is also one of the better tracks on the album. After this the album slows down for me. The tracks are still good, but not near as good as the first 5, and not even close to the songs on &quot;Aenima.&quot; But all in all, this album is a truely great work. You can definatly tell a lot of time and effort was put into it. And this wouldn't be a &quot;Lateralus&quot; review if I didn't mention the cd design. Probably the best cd cover design I've ever seen. Never seen anything like it.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie was everything I feared it would be--bleak, pretentious, and confusing.  The one sin I haven't heard enumerated yet by other disappointed reviewers is that PT Anderson demonstrated so little storytelling ability!  Two main complaints:  first, the dialogue was on the nose.  Every character yelled about how awful their lives were and how much they hated each other.  Second, Anderson repeated characters and scenes so literally that they weren't thematic, they were redundant.  Two old men dying of cancer who lament the fact they cheated on their wives?  The repetition diluted the impact that either scene would have had on its own.   The only saving grace of the film was Aimee Mann's aural presence.  Spare yourself three hours of film agony and go buy her latest album instead.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is so nice... A cross between 70's King Crimson, Rush's Cygnus X-1 and 70's Black Sabbath, this album will stand for years... Why? Cause the sound is excellent, Bottrill's production is top notch and the songs are so progressive... Highlights:  The Grudge,Parabola and Thicks and Leeches... Dany Carey is a hell of a drummer who play odd rythms like you and me are writings our names... Adam Jones' guitar sound is so heavy and crystal clear... I my opinion, the Perfect Circle influence is not a bad thing cause there is much more musical details on this record than on Aenema... I like the soft parts of Lateralus as much as the heavy parts... The band did a lot of research for cool sounds... Try listening this CD with Headphones, it's a must!!!
B00001MXWX|2.0|Let me start by stating that I am a die-hard Star Trek fan.  But this movie was just...horrible.  I don't know where to begin.  I gave this movie two stars, one for the simple fact that this movie is Trek, and another for the superb acting.  But regardless of the latter, this movie has nothing going for it.  The story all together is terrible, and unrealistic.  How come the Baku look EXACTLY like Humans? How come the planet looks EXACTLY like Earth (besides the fact that it was shot in the Canadian Rockies :)?  This movie felt more like a mediocre episode than anything else.  If you want to see a good Trek film, buy The Wrath of Khan or First Contact.
0525945636|2.0|As a longtime fan of Ken Follett, I find his most recent work disturbingly lightweight. Specifically, is his interest in memory loss simply that of a professional writer, or is it a personal interest necessitated by his own loss of faculties? It is difficult to reconcile this effort with previous works, such as the splendid -- indeed, writing-textbook-quality -- &quot;The Man from St. Petersburg.&quot; Or, &quot;Lie Down with Lions,&quot; or &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot; Seriously, I had the feeling that it was written by &quot;a loved one,&quot; who tried his or her inept best to ghost in Follett's style, but fell dismally short of the mark. I was delighted as I began, disappointed as the book progressed, then angry, and finally appalled and fearful by book's-end.  Ken Follett: If you're alive and well, please let your fans know. And if you're not alive and well, will the Inept Imposter please step forward to recieve the much-deserved lashes.
079072961X|5.0|&quot;The Fugitive&quot; is a first-rate movie. Harrison Ford plays a surgeon who has been framed for the murder of his wife. Convicted, he escapes in the wake of a spectacular crash and sets out to find the real murderer. Tommy Lee Jones plays the federal marshall whose task it is to catch Ford. To tell more would be to give away too much, and the editorial review above provides an adequate synopsis. Suffice it to say that this is a tense, fast-paced tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action (including some great scenes), and the battle of wits between Ford, trying to stay at large and solve the murder, and Jones, who's determined to bring him in, is excellent. Both Ford and Jones are outstanding in their roles. If you like to own videos or DVDs, this is one you ought to have in your collection. Very highly recommended.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I just want to say that I'm a huge fan of Depeche Mode! This album is really exciting. I'm glad they named it &quot;Exciter&quot;. Martin has written beautiful and wonderful songs and David has an absolutely sexy voice. I have listened to this cd over and over again. I hope you find this bit of information helpful. If you don't own it, you don't know what you're missing. Thanks Depeche Mode!!!
B0000524E5|5.0|This is a movie for everyone.  I have read reviews of it that say that guys don't like it.  What planet are the &quot;guys&quot; from?? Yes I am a girl, but I do have ALOT of male friends.  Every guy I was with in the theatre with (I saw it 3 times in the theater, with guys) loved the movie.  I will admit when I saw the previews I was turned away because I thought it was a couple of girls stripping in a bar.  Was I wrong??  I was pleasantly suprised!! I highly recommend this great movie to all of the people who want to see a great movie.
B00005B36H|5.0|After five years of waiting, Tool finnaly released it's third full-length album, Lateralus. As soon as I bought it, I gave it a spin.<br />The first thing I noticed was the production. On previous albums the production was already excellent, but the band has never sounded better than on Lateralus. On good stereo's, it's almost as if singer Maynard james Keenan is standing right next to you.  After a few songs, it became clear that the album is impossible to grasp on a first listen. The songs are complex and most of them are over 7 minutes. In comparison with previous albums, Tool has never sounded more mature than this.<br />The artists themself have also improved. Drummer Danny Carey's percussions are better than ever; beside his normal drums he uses al kinds of tribal drums which result in one of the most percussion-driven albums ever. Maynard James Keenan's vocals are more versatile than ever, on certain parts on the album he sings like with A Perfect Circle (APC): softer, clear and with more melody than on previous Tool albums. Definitely chilling!<br />A short description of the songs:<br />1. The grudge<br />Starts with some tribal drumming. The song knows it's heavy and 'less heavy' parts, in which Keenan uses both his Tool- and APC-vocals. The song is dark, full of unexpected turns (typically Tool), but sounds more massively than on previous albums.<br />2. Eon blue apocalypse<br />Some guitar and echo-effects. An opener for The patient.<br />3. The patient<br />The song starts calm, but soon after it's beginning Adam Jones guitar kicks in which results in a slow and heavy rithm. Keenan's vocal melody is stunning.<br />4. Mantra<br />Sounds like... guitar-whales. Not a song, but just some sound.<br />5. Schism<br />The first single from Lateralus Starts with a bass-riff, then gets heavier as the chorus approaches. The mid-section is a calm, almost hypnotic part. After the mid-section the song gets heavy and after some drumming it ends in an almost tortured climax.<br />6. Parabol<br />A very calm song, a bit of guitar and Keenan's bewildering voice. At the point where you begin to wonder 'when does the song begin?'...<br />7. Parabola<br />...parabola kicks in, a fast, heavy song, with some more tribal drumming, good vocal melody and one of the best bass-riffs from the album.<br />8. Thick and leeches<br />An aggressive song with aggresive drumming, aggresive guitar and bass and Keenan screaming like he never did before (and never will do again). One of the best of the album.<br />9. Lateralis/lateralus<br />On the first print of the album, the song is spelled 'lateralis', but Tool hasn't confirmed yet whether or not this is a typo. The song is another song that begins calm, but ends heavy. Good guitar, good vocals and more that Tool made one of the best bands ever.<br />10. Disposition<br />11. Reflection<br />12. Triad<br />Three songs linked together. The first two sounds very Arabian-like; calm with some tribal drumming and a beautiful guitar-riff. They are very different from the other songs. Traid is one riff, building to it's climax.<br />13. Faaip de oiad<br />The songtitle means 'voice of God'. This song is not really a song (in my opinion :-) ), but is a hoax. Distorted like a detuned radio with a histerically talking guy. It's up to Tool-fans to decrypt the song.<br />Many Tool fans think that this album is not as good as Aenima (it's predecessor), but must say I don't agree with them. Lateralus sounds more developed, with better production and better vocals and drumming. If the songs themselves are better than the songs on Aenima, I don't know. It's impossible to tell after just a week of listening. Time will tell.
B0000399WI|5.0|When Andy locks himself in the office and plays the Operetta.  This is a truly outstanding moment in the film.  You must see the beginning, the middle and the end of this movie, without interruption, to truly grasp everything this film has to offer, and to appreciate this scene.  Absolutely Outstanding!  No special effects, no computer generated effects, just a truly outstanding film on its own.  The Actors chosen were perfect for their parts, everyone from Andy to Red and the other prisoners, to the warden and the tough prison guard.  I couldn't see any of these characters being portrayed by anyone else.  Remarkable in every way!  How this picture got overlooked at the Oscars, I don't know.<br />And what are these people talking about when they say you learn to feel that Andy was justified for committing this crime.  Are they sure they saw THIS movie?
0440236304|5.0|Excellent narrative of the training, waiting, and combat of a paratrooper in WWII.  It could have used a few more chapter breaks to make it easier to read in discrete chunks, but it is so engrossing you won't want to put it down anyway.  The prose is not as polished as Seven Roads, but it is still a fascinating and wonderful glimpse into the life of a young paratrooper in the world's bloodiest war.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is phenomonal.  Best Movie I ever saw. I agree with one of the other reviews that I read, the length of the movie is absolutely essential for this story to be told.  You feel what Andy went through, you pass the years with him, and you feel his hope of freedom.  The way the story is told by Red, (Morgan Freeman) but based mostly around Andy, (Tim Robbins) makes you feel like you really know them personally.  You feel their emotions and dissappointments.  I Love this Movie.  You can watch it over and over again and it still stirs the same emotions you felt the first time you saw it.  Definitely a Classic.
0195067142|5.0|An excellent account of personal experience.  Graphic and blunt in its detailed narrative, praises, and critiques.  Gripping from beginning to end, I couldn't put it down.
B000005S27|3.0|During the five years that Take That were with us , we had the opportunity to enjoy some of the most well made , healthy pop songs of the 90's.Quitte a suprise offering from a group which had at least on the surface , all these ridiculous elements which made boybands so hard to take seriously in the first place : coxcomb photoshoots , ludicrus costumes for their live acts ,depthless dance singles as first releases.As years went by though , the melodies were obviously getting better and Gary Barlow's writting skill was fastly growing up.With their covers they gave new life to old hits such as How Deep Is Your Love , Relight My Fire and Could It Be Magick. U.S huge hit single Back For Good made them world wide known but actually Pray is the track you'll find yourself enjoying the most. It combines synchronised backing vocals with a sunny vibe and tender lyrics.It's true that the mellow Never Forget was a clumsy way to say goodbye but this is the first group which prooved that boybands can be something more than smiley posters and stupid video-clips with teenage girls clapping all around the place.The fact is that all the likes of Backstreet Boys and N'Sync will never be as fun as they once were.
B00005B36H|5.0|&quot;No one has ever written, painted, sculpted, modeled, built, or invented except literally to get out of hell.&quot;                /Antonin Artaud/<br />TOOL is of my very favorite bands of the 90's. Maynard J. Keenan's voice is full of depth, passion, and emotion, matching the confused, paranoid, but still meaningful and thought-provoking lyrics. The textures and rhythms on &quot;Lateralus&quot; are beautiful and may intrigue even hard-core prog-rock fans. Despite the songs are quite long, they do not tend to drone on and on like sometimes on &quot;Aenima&quot;. Also &quot;Lateralus&quot; is sadder and less angry than &quot;Aenima&quot; and &quot;Undertow&quot;, not mentioning &quot;Opiate&quot;.<br />As a whole the feeling is somehow one of morbid beauty, dimming light, reflections of whirling blades, tension and despair. And longing. There are more moody, quiet moments than on the previous albums, but the hypnotic arrangements still tend to culminate and burst into the insane rage.<br />I would highly recommend this album and this band for fans of King Crimson AND the Swans ...like myself (-: <br />&quot;Lateralus&quot; is a very mature piece of work. It's a beautiful, very well crafted work of pain.
B00004TRD8|5.0|There's nothing wrong at all with this DVD!!!!! Every DVD should be jam-packed with all of these special features!!!!! The Titanic DVD only came with a trailer, that's it. At least a \\"Making of ...\\" documentary would have been nice!!! Anyways, this *IS* the ideal DVD! YOU MUST BUY IT FOR YOUR DVD PLAYER!!!!!!!

B000059Z8J|5.0|I love this DVD edition of Superman - The Movie. Even though if I have seen this movie a million times since I was a little kid I still love it. I brought the whole set and the features are wonderful to the first Superman. In Superman II, III, and IV the features only include theatrical trailer and cast which I like but I was expecting more like deleted scenes and the making. What's up with Superman III and IV? I have seen a longer version than that. There are alot of deleted scenes in Superman III and IV that they forgot to put in the DVD. I also heard that they had a 134 minute version of Superman IV. Well, even though that they don't have those features on there I still love this DVD set of Superman. It is great! I also love the screen tests of what they did. They did the screen tests on Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. They also did it on some other people but I don't remember the names. I was also expecting to see Superman - The Movie in the theater which from what I heard that they were going to re-release it before this DVD set came out but I guess they just wanted to re-release it on DVD and video instead. If you are a big Superman fan and if you really want the whole collection of the set go get it you will enjoy it!
0140433627|5.0|&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is nothing like Hollywood says it is. This thought-provoking and heart-wrenching book left me feeling a connection with both the doctor and his monster. The exploration of the human condition through which Mary Shelley leads the reader is applicable regardless of time. Also, the prose is relatively easy to read, so no one should be afraid of reading this relatively short work. I highly recommend this book.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is an excellent album.  This can only be expected since Tool has not put out an album for six years.  I would not go as far as to say it was as good of an album as Aenima, but nothing can compare to Aenima.  Lateralus was mixed brilliantly and it has a sound that can only be described as perfect.  I would recomend this album to anyone who was interested.
B000021XS0|5.0|What can I say?<br />This reminds me a lot of Rush's &quot;Hemispheres,&quot; which was the sequel to &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot;, right down to the samples from the prequel in the middle instrumental piece.  This doesn't surprise me because last time DT came through San Antonio, they did a 45 minute set of classic Rush.  Imitation being the truest form of flattery, DT still pulls it off with amazing ability.  Also listen for subtle nods to &quot;The Wall&quot;.  The use of the pipe organ in Scene Eight especially reminded me of &quot;In the Flesh?&quot; again, a song they covered on &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;.<br />Excellent.  I would like to see them continue in this direction.
B00004U8JV|1.0|I was Extremely Excited to find out in 1997 that a Sequel to the 1992-93 Smash Hit, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was going to be released.  But when I saw it, it was bland and boring.  The acting sucks and the plot is garbage.  But anyways, here's the story; Billionare John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), whom was the creator of JP and President of his company, &quot;Ingen&quot;, has now filed for Bankruptcy, due to the recuring lawsuits against the family members of the people who died on the island.  But, he has a card up his sleeve.  Another, called Isla Sorna, or later know as &quot;Site B&quot;, tht contains Dinosaurs without fences and patrols, unlike the first island.  One of the Survivors from the first island, Iam Malchom (Jeff Goldblum) now protests the idea of studying this island and going on it...then he finds out that his girlfriend is on it already.  Immedately he forms a rescue team, which one of them is Photographer Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie Carr (Richard from &quot;The West Wing&quot;) to search for his love, Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore). But along the way is a ragtag team of Hunters (Taking away Micheal Chricton's version of Dogson and two hunters from the Book version), whom hired by Hammond's Greedy Newphew, Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) who wants to create another JP park, on the mainland.  Dinos show up, chaos (hehe) happens and a rousing and lame ending, in which the T-Rex romps throughthe steets of San Diego (does the name &quot;Godzilla&quot; sound familiar to you???), Spielburg (which I must say, is his worse film ever since &quot;1941&quot;) tries to give the Audence a finale that every one will love....But instead, it's a finale that everyone goes &quot;What the Hell???&quot;  Skip this one and watch the classic original or even better, wait and countdown to the reamianing day untill &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot;.  Anyway you do it, just don't watch this movie.
B00005B1EX|5.0|Halford's last album was awesome.  Seeing him live was even more impressive.  I'm amazed at how he has been able to capture that power and presence on this double CD.  He hits most of the highs of Priest as well as his new material from the studio and Fight while still including some more obscure Priest material.<br />Halford proves why Heavy Metal involves a singer who can scream rather than rap.<br />Get this CD ... you won't regret it.
B000002MY3|5.0|I bought jagged little pill at a used cd store, 2 years ago and I still don't understand how any one would want to give this Cd up. I have a collection of about 55 Cds and this is the only 1 I play on my cdplayer without skipping a song. This is my favorite cd and i love every single one of the tracks.  My favorite songs are Ironic, You oughta know, you learn, and Hand in my Pocket. The other songs are great too.  Buy this Cd, you won't regret it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window in my book comes close to being the greatest films of all-time. I liked it better than Casablanca. Stewart playes his role fantasticly and Grace Kelly is simply georgus. Hitchcocks finest films!  Buy it you wont be disapointed
B00000DGUG|4.0|When I first bought and listened to this Cd I was horrified.  What had become the Alanis I loved who sang powerful catchy songs that I couldn't live without.  The main reason I purchased Junkie, was for her hit &quot;Thank You&quot;.  When I heard all the other songs on Junkie I didn't like a single one of them.  But now after about a year and half I've grown to like this Cd.  She has some really good strong songs including Front Row, Thank U, The Couch, Can't Not, UR and I Was Hoping.  But then there are a few others that just make me wonder WHY???  Such as &quot;Baba&quot; which is a loud noisy song that i skip evertime on my cd player, and there's the whiny &quot;Are You still Mad&quot; And there's the just plain terrible &quot;Would not Come.&quot;  Most of the other tracks that I haven't mentioned are pretty good or ok.  Overall this Cd takes some getting use to but is still good and I recomend it.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is certainly not what I expected From reverend Maynard, but it is a favourite in my &quot;mind bending music&quot; category.<br />This is the first Tool album where we hear harmonization by multiple voices in almost every song (probably courtesy of MJKs stint with A Perfect Circle), producing a trippy, scrolling vocal arabesque in some cases. Much less Bass than in previous albums, but a whole lot more screaching guitar treble comes in the form of trippy/scrolly/arabesque riffs to match the vocals. All this is often juxtaposed with a drumming rhythm that, thank the gods, is NOT the standard 2/4 or 4/4 rhythm of &quot;boom, pop, boom, pop&quot;. <br />What we dont get in Lateralus is the trademark deep n' dark Tool sound. Some songs sound eerily similar to something Skid Row, Faster Pussycat, or Motley Crue might come up with, then tack on some wierd synthesizer sounds. That is, without the heavy thumping Bass guitar, the higher pitch of the album almost comes off as cheap glam metal. However, masterful musicians like Tool have come in just above the wire with this album. Thus, it doesnt sound &quot;cheap&quot;. Instead, it leaves the impression that these guys are growing spiritually, but are afraid to reflect it in their music. Like they wrote some good poetry, but simply applied angry music to it based on what they think their clientele will buy. <br />Seems that the boys have branched out. Infact, as I listen to the album, which sports alot of buddhist themes, I wonder what inspired these madmen to place these &quot;light&quot; words with the angst ridden grind of &quot;heavy metal&quot;. <br />What have &quot;they&quot; done with the MJK that said &quot;Some say we'll see Armageddon soon, I certainly hope we will&quot;? Eagerly awaiting the death of 7 billion people . . .<br />Apparently the boys from TOOL have been hanging out with the Dalai Lama, because now we hear lyrics like:<br /> &quot;This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that Iam not alone in This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal all this pain is an illusion . . . This holy reality, this holy experience. Choosing to be here in...This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality. Embrace this moment. Remember. we are eternal. all this pain is an illusion.&quot;<br />Did Tool &quot;sell out&quot;? Are they just growing older and more mature? Did you ever think you would hear them sing about the holiness of reality? I didnt, but I am glad to hear it. For all its pros and cons, I enjoy the album immensely, and it will probably be the only CD in my player for about the next 4 months.<br />Postscript, update after listening to the album for about 2 months:<br />The growth of your enjoyment of this album (Ea), and your life (El), is directly proportional to your ability to let this  go(G), be patient(P), and keep reminding yourself of this(R), during and after you listen to the album. <br />   Ea+El = (G*P*R )^2<br />As I listen to Lateralus, reality changes, and my appreciation for it deepens to obsession (with non-obsession). Lateralus disrupts my hypnosis. Frees self from the self. I eagerly await TOOL's next audio journey . . .
0790736314|5.0|&quot;The Exorcist&quot; is my favorite scary movie, although I think it's more of a disturbing one. What's scary about this film is the story. Imagine having a child who was possessed and doing such things. The movie seems more real to me than most horror movies. It's the story, not the infamous shocks, that scares me. Now onto the performances. They are real, unforgettable, and thought-provoking. Ellen Burstyn, in particular as Linda Blair's mother. This, to me, is her best role in a movie ever. I've only seen the original film, last year at Christmas time when I rented it and then bought it. I haven't seen the re-released &quot;Director's Cut&quot; in theaters, but I perfer to see the original 1973 film. The documentary on the 25th anniversary of this movie is fascinating, as well as the terrifying theatrical trailers. This is a must for any serious fan of horror films.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Brilliant movie, excellent direction. Tom Hanks has given an outstanding and exceptional performance. Movie revolves around seeing the life through simple & straight forward eyes of Forrest Gump who is unaffected and un-interested in the complexities of the materialistic world. And well, I also agree along with many of the reviews posted here for the punch line of the movie :\\"Life will never be the same after you see the world thru' the eyes of Forrest Gump\\". Well, what are you waiting for?? Rush for the VHS or DVD and enjoy... Don't miss it !
B00005AXEL|5.0|I must admit I was leery of buying this CD after my negative experience with Nicks' previous effort... Street Angel.  It turned out I have nothing at all to fear.  My personal favorite song on the album is 'I Miss You,' but they are all excellent.  *This* is the Stevie Nicks music that I fell in love with when I was a kid...  I give this effort my highest recommendation to fans and newbies alike!
0780631684|5.0|WOW! Just WOW! This is an amazing movie! It's REALLY scary and surprising, and UNPREDICTABLE unlike &quot;Scream&quot; and &quot;I Know..&quot; and &quot;I Still Know&quot;...I don't think it even categorizes as the same type of movies!! Simply another level movie... And besides...I can really relate to that movie due to a few reasons, but never mind about that...<br />GET IT!! WATCH IN A DARK ROOM! PUMP UP VOLUME!<br />(and I am NOT gonna apologize for my english like almost everyone else does...cause i think it's pretty damn good, me being from israel and all :) )
6305013578|1.0|The Madacy Entertainment version of Metropolis is just plain horrid.  It's very inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for.  This particular DVD looks like it was produced using THE worst print of the film that could be found and THE worst transfer equipment that could be found.  It has the appearance of being the first experimental project someone tried who was just learning how to transfer film to video.  We won't even begin to discuss the nasty soundtrack and silly music on this version.<br />I'm only glad I didn't spend very much on this disc - it'll make a nice drink coaster, I guess.  I'll be on the lookout for a better DVD version of this amazing Sci-Fi classic.
B0000060NF|5.0|Probably the BEST protest songs EVER written!  Being a child of the sixties and a Viet-Nam vet I relate on a level that brings the innermost feelings of what I consider &quot;true niverna&quot; to life.  I sit at my desk (I'm self-employed &amp; can do it) and play this record (OK, CD- 60's remember?) and I am transported to to a place where I can ask &quot;Why is there a need to escalate? &amp; all he asks is we give love to one another?&quot; and I don't need an answer.   Sounds corney &amp; trite but I REALLY love this CD.  If you don't like it I suggest you look deeper inside because this speaks to my soul and I'd REALLY like you to have the same experience-it's something special if you can get it.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I don't realy like Britney Spears but she does have some songs on Oops... I Did It Again that I kind of like. Her voice can't quite compare to alot of people but hey, atleast she's better than Marilyn Manson, right?
0887307280|3.0|The author describes his younger years (0-40) as a wandering neer-do-well who could not keep a job or a wife for long, and then sort of fell into whatever he is doing now. He never ran a business until he started his consulting business -- where he tells people how to run their businesses.  Gerber loves the franchise form of business, where the new franchisee goes to &quot;Hamburger U&quot; and learns every detail of running a burger shop. My business (a wine distributor) is not a burger shop. Something new pops up every day, and it's not in the operating manual. That said, the book is worth the short time it takes to read it. I took some good ideas from the book and plan to try implementing them in some form in my business.

6305897786|4.0|People who see this film expecting it to be like \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" are going to be Very, Very Disappointed. \\"The Ninth Gate\\" is the Polar Opposite to \\"Sleepy Hollow\\". Both are Exceptional Horror films, both star Johnny Depp, but they are very different Horror films.<br />There is Barely a Scene in the film that Johnny doesn't act in, the film is Entirely His. He plays David Korso, a Unscrupulous finder of Rare Books. He is commissioned by a Strange Collector (Frank Langella) to find out if his book, titled \\"The Ninth Gate\\", is genuine or fake. His search leads him to a lot of Strange Characters and a few Close Calls.<br />The Whole film has an \\"Angel Heart\\" feel about it, and it makes a Good Companion piece to that film. The film has a Slow pace, but it Never Lags, it's not Action Packed or Full of Effects, but they Are Both There when Necessary. It's Definitely not for Everyone, you need Patience, a Good night's sleep the Night Before and a Stomach for Satanic stuff.<br />Johnny's Understated Performance looks Utterly Effortless, He Carries this Heavy with Ease. Frank Langella is Appropriately Mysterious and Sinister in his Few scenes, every other performer in the film are limited to few scenes, but they All make the most of their time. Emmanuelle Seigner is Also Mysterious, which is probably due to the fact that she's no a very good Actress. She is Still very Sexy though. Lena Olin breaths life into the film as a Crazed Satanist, she too is quite Good Looking in the film, and she also Acts well. Ultimately, the Thesping is left up to Johnny and his performance will Make or Break the film for you. For me, it Definitely Made it. The Script is Sharp, the Dialogue is Clever, the Twists are Interesting, the Ending is one to Talk About and Ultimately, I became as Obsessed about finding the book as Johnny was.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|At first i was un sure about buying an album with Nicole Kidman singing on, as i hadn't heard her sing before, but i loved Lady Marmalade so i bought the album anyway.  I have to say that Nicloe CAN sing and has managed to convert some old classic songs to a great sound track.  My favourite songs on th=is album are Lady Marmalade (Lil Kim, Mya Pink and Christina), Because We Can (Fat Boy Slim), Your Song (ewan Macgregor) and One Day I'll Fly Away (Nicole Kidman)  This album is definetly worth having and i can't wait to see the film.
B00005B36H|5.0|Whereas the first few reviews of this cd displayed here have stated that the songs are not as powerful or as meaningful as before, i feel that you have simply failed to realize the depth between the notes and lyrics and are only comparing this album to their previous instead of actually listening. The first time i listened to this cd i thought it was simply good and worth listening to. But the second time round, while actually listening to the songs, i found them to be much more compelling and inspiring than their earlier works. I  personally don't care that it's simply another work by Tool particularilly enough to just 'jump on the bandwagon' and give it a good review. The simple truth to any band is, that with time, their music can quite frankly become old, repetitive, and therefore bites. But Maynard has proved that this isn't the case with Tool. Each new release seems to, quite frankly, get better and better. And you shouldn't 'just' base this album upon their previous works. You have to take it for what it is; a work of art. If it were exactly the same as the previous released cds, well, then you could compare, simply looking for flaws and or similarities to judge its value. But just sit back, listen, and have faith that Tool provides, once again, what no other band can.... save perhaps VAST, hehe.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Well, I just love when someone has the nerve to set up an electronic beat to most to our beloved melodies! The beat, so easy, so calm, so practical! Moby has made my life so much easier; now I can explain to my 1st grade students why any tune can be so easily followed by clapping hands. It was difficult for them to keep up with the metronome... But hey!,  this is not Julliard!!!

1881273156|5.0|You cannot just say &quot;This is a great book&quot; or &quot;this is a useful book&quot;. It is more! It should be made mandatory reading for all husbands and wifes, whether you have been married 10 days or 10 years! It does not matter if your marraige is already perfect in every detail, or if your marraige is almost on the rocks. This book helps you to understand your partner better, and gives you ways to recognise the needs of your partner, without him or her having to write them down in large block letters on a sheet of paper. I read it cover to cover non-stop, it was so interesting. I also recognised through reading this book what mistakes I was making in my relationship (and what mistakes my partner was making too!). As soon as I was finished, I passed it on to my wife, with the simple comment that she might find it interesting reading...   she did! The next step is to put the ideas in the book into practice!

0064431622|5.0|Eric Carle's \\"The Mixed-Up Chameleon\\" tells the story of a little chameleon who hates the fact that he changes color to match his surroundings. He notices a zoo and all the wonderful and distinctive animals there. He begins to wish for (and receives) various elements from the animals (\\"I wish I was tall, like a giraffe\\" is one). The chameleon ends up as an assemblage of parts which look great on the original animals, but don't do very well all together. The rub comes when the hungry chameleon cannot reach the fly to eat it. He wishes to be himself again and regains his true form.<br />My kids love this book, not only for the beautiful artwork, but also because as each page is turned, the new animal whose feature the chameleon takes is shown, so at the end, all the animals are shown at the edge of the page. I like the message that being yourself is always the best, and that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence.
B000059ZLH|5.0|If you own every DT album, this is must have. You get the band's commentary in additon to the big show.  Even if you like thier style of music, you will not be disappointed with this epic!<br />I hate reading reviews that aren't specific, but this Video is just synergenic. Everything combines to make the finished product greater than the sum of its parts. I don't think there is a better way to describe it.
B000000993|5.0|This is the creepiest Tool album!  I mean, just listen to disgustipated!  That's a creepy song.  And flood?  Creepy.  Creepy like a moldy avacado is creepy, in that it looks nice on the outside, or at least as nice as a ripe avacado should look, and you're planning on cracking it open to find all that sweet meat, but instead there is a hollow filled with mold next to the pit.  You drop the avacado in disgust, shuddering.   Unlike the avacado, this album draws you into its dementia, draws you in with poppy hooks, those fantastic drums, and that hypnotic voice . . . also, that dissonant, occasionally tinny guitar, weaving through the songs . . . and the snappy bass. By the way, poppy hooks?  Yeah, I think this is their poppiest album, and as far as song structure goes, I think it's their least innovative.  I don't understand why people think Aenema's structure is dull and repetative, and Undertow is not.  I mean, let's face it, Sober is a creepy and demented pop song. Bottom is a pretty standard rock song, with a long bridge.  But it's the accents, the little things, the nuances, with which this album abounds, and they are all wonderfull.  Five stars.
B00000K0YC|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the five best jazz albums ever made is this 1956 masterpiece. Recorded in a single day at Rudy Van Gelder's living room/studio, Sonny Rollins earned his place as a legend with &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot;. Aided and abetted by powerhouse drummer Max Roach, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and bassist Doug Watkins, the quartet plays with the precision of a chamber orchestra, and swings just as hard. It's not very often that you hear an album where the musicians are so in tune with each other. From the breezy sway of &quot;St. Thomas&quot; to the final notes of &quot;Blue 7&quot;, Rollins and company shows how it should be done. This newly remastered edition finally sounds as great as the original vinyl pressing but without the hefty price you'll shuck out for an original copy. No serious jazz fan should be without a copy of this amazing album in their collection.
0452282152|5.0|This is a must read. It has got to be one of the most captivating and chilling stories i have ever read. After reading, I decided to look up information on Johannes Vermeer only to discover that most of the names and information on the artist and his family were correct...right down to where he married into a catholic family after being a christian. I could not put it down, it was so, moving in a way, knowing that half of it was true. It was like you were Griet and you were being painted...Really this is a must read for anyone, no matter what your tastes are like, I am only 15 and i loved it, yet I'm not usually interested in history... it will make you want to keep reading..to learn more...i am now going to study history in school because of this book. Please read it or you may regret doing so.
0385006896|5.0|This is the essential collection of the adventures of the greatest detective of all time, Sherlock Holmes and his rather slow-witted foil, Dr. Watson. The atmosphere of the foggy, lacklustre streets of London, peopled by constables and hansoms, comes wafting out of these pages, as Holmes and Watson succeed in solving numerous problems, featuring some of the most memorable episodes in pop literature. Holmes is undeniably one of the most striking personages in the history of fiction. An expert fencer, boxer and an addict of &quot;seven-percent solution&quot; cocaine, he is eccentric, yet brilliant, patriotic, though possessed of immense analytical powers. The tales, which are, for the most part, extremely well-constructed, and are loaded with suspense and surprise, range from the adventure of &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; to the &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; and &quot;The Final Problem&quot; in which Holmes engages in a deadly confrontation with his arch-enemy and, arguably, his intellectual equal, Professor Moriarty, the &quot;Napoleon of crime&quot;.

B0000024JA|3.0|Meth has a distinct stilo from the rest of the Clan and it is apparent that he ain't wrapped too tight. I admire this album for two reasons: the beats all by the RZA and the chronic influence all over the lyrics. Honeys might not dig this because the version of All I Need with Mary J. is absent but the dark and bangin' original is , so are Tical, Biscuits and Release Yo Delf.If you wanna go back to '94, Prendelo!
B000002HRE|1.0|After I listened to Load (which came out in '96) I thought that they were going into a more slower paced and more relaxing style of music, for their later career. When I heard about Reload I thought it would be another CD like Load. I was devistated on how much this album [stunk]. Im not joking, this album is a piece of Horse ... I cant believe that Metallica, the greatest rock band on the planet could actually bring them selves to this garbage. This is by far the worst CD that I have ever attemped to listen to by Metallica. I strongly suggest that you do not buy this worthless [stuff]. If you want heavy metal metallica, I suggest you start off with RIDE THE LIGHTNING or MASTER OF PUPPETS. If you are looking for a softer side of Metallica you should maybe get THE BLACK ALBUM or LOAD (preferably the Black album).
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD was defintly not Nirvana's best stuff. And it's way overrated (considering the fact that bands like soundgarden were also out at this time and had some pretty badass stuff out). But if it wasn't for this CD i wouldn't have even touched their second cd In Utero, which is really a much better CD not washed down and just reallly really good.
B000002HMH|3.0|When I heard about this CD I expected the old heavy metal metallica, but hey what can you expect from a band thats been kickin' for almost 20 years, the times have changed too. I am not saying that this was a bad album, I personally think it was good. It was the begining of a new softer Metallica. They still impress me for their efforts. I do recommend this Metallica album for those who like them, but are thinking about settling on a more relaxing album. I recommend all (exept one) Metallica albums, they are all good. For heavy metalhead albums, I recommend KILL 'EM ALL, RIDE THE LIGHTNING and MASTER OF PUPPETS. If you are looking for a slightly more quiet and cool metallica, I recommend AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, THE BLACK ALBUM and this album. GARAGE INC. is good, but I prefer Metallica's own work and style, not already copyrighted songs. All is good exept for RELOAD. RELOAD is a piece of garbage ..., under any circumstances, do not buy that cd.

B00000DGRX|5.0|THE BAND: Ian Gillan (vocals), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards), Roger Glover (bass), Ian Paice (drums & percusssion).<br /><br />COMMENTS: Originally released in 1972. I put off getting this \\"Anniversary\\" disc for some time... thinking I all ready had the original \\"Machine Head\\" on CD that was released in the mid 1980's... so what's the point? I'm sure many DP fans have at one time thought this, but do yourself a favor. Trade in your old CD and get replace it with this \\"25th Anniversary\\" edition. The difference in the original being remastered is worth the price alone. But, you get so much more - I look at it like it's a piece of history. For those classic rock fans; who wouldn't jump at the opportunity to obtain some old alternate versions of songs from Zeppelin, The Who, Kiss, Van Halen or Aerosmith remastered? Roger Glover, using today's technology, made this CD sound up-to-date. This remastered version is crisp and dynamic. It sounds like Ian Paice has his drum kit right there with you while you're listening to the CD. The 2nd disc is a treat. All those famous Blackmore trademark guitar solo's are just a tad bit different. Gillian's vocals are for the most part the same, but there are a few instances where his highs are higher and his lows are lower. Glover's & Paice's roles remain for the most part in tact and unchanged from the original. The addition of \\"When A Blind Man Cries\\" is nice. It shows a softer side to the Purple we've come to know. The liner notes are extensive with some wonderful pictures to boot. I rank this album in my all-time 'Top 10' list of rock albums. Essential... \\"MACHINE HEAD\\" is absolutely (5+ stars).
0783240503|5.0|This movie is my all time favorite. When I saw the video in the store, I had a gut feeling that I should get it. When I saw it for the first time, I was expecting something like a bad movie with one or two songs to pep it up. I was surprised when the whole thing was a musical, and the dancing has really good choreography.  Donny Osmond was really good with the music and the dialogue.  My favorite part was the Benjamin Calypso, because if you look carefully at Donny's face during the scene, you will see that he is trying really hard not to laugh at Judah and the dancers. I really would recommend this movie to all of the Donny fans and anyone else who loves music.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's foundation is revealed in Lateralus.  Most critics of this album can't get into it as much as Aenima or undertow because of the more progressive influence of the record.  Lateralus is seething with new sonic textures.  Justin Chancellor's sound is a lot cleaner than previous efforts.  Adam Jones solidity is even more present in this cd.  Danny Carey's playing provides the listener with a fresh new look of constantly changing meter.  Tool takes the listener down a different path with each track.  Take the time to listen to the CD and you will appreciate just how great the band is.
B000000XCH|5.0|By the time the late '60's/early '70's rolled around, the rock music scene needed a fresher and more uniquely creative sound. There to fill the bill was a group of northern California musicians known as Creedence Clearwater Revival. This group, which featured John Fogerty on vocals and lead guitar, his late brother Tom Fogerty on guitar, Doug Clifford on drums, and Stu Cook on bass guitar, would forever leave their signature stamp on rock music history, and would set a path for other groups to follow, such as the likes of The Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. As soon as CCR played their instruments, one knew that a magical, musical sound would emerge from them, a sound which would eventually make CCR world famous from the above mentioned time period, and beyond.&quot;Cosmos Factory&quot; doesn't fail to disappoint from the very first note. &quot;Ramble Tamble&quot; gets things started off in progressive, classic swamp rock fashion, then eases into a soulful, bluesy groove with &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;, a number that has also been recorded by the likes of John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, and perhaps others. The tone of the CD is once again jump-started, courtesy of the up-tempo &quot;Travelin' Band&quot;. John, Tom, Stu, and Doug provide some strong licks on Roy Orbison's &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;. &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door&quot;, &quot;Run Through The Jungle&quot; and &quot;Up Around The Bend&quot; perhaps make some hidden, casual statements about the Vietnam war, and they're fine rockin' numbers to boot! Stu Cook's unique over-the-top bass playing, which is heard at the beginning of the melancholic &quot;My Baby Left Me&quot;, is the highlight of this particular track, while the whys and wherefores of &quot;Who'll Stop The Rain&quot; will have you pondering, for sure. The ultimate masterpiece on &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot; is the ultra-rockin' eleven minute long jam &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot;. This version gets my vote over both the Gladys Knight and Marvin Gaye versions by a landslide! &quot;Long As I Can See The Light&quot; closes out the CD on a somber note, but is a sensible ballad, nonetheless. If you're planning on taking a tour of &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot;, you better do it soon. With a factory pumping out such a great product, it is not destined to last forever, and is sure to shut down production and close up shop any day now.

0671027344|5.0|This book was TERIFFIC. The writing style is eloquent, and the author has a grasp of the first experience of new ideas. Somtimes I felt Charlie was a little naive, but I finished the book within a few hours. I couldn't put it down.
6304119046|5.0|Yes, it's true. CITIZEN KANE, like so many people have said countless times before, is my own inspiration to filmmaking; acting, directing, writing and producing my own future Oscar-winning epic masterpieces - PRISONER OF WAR, PRISONER OF WAR: PART II, PHILIP, KING OF SPAIN, and TRIANGLE. Although, I should say that CITIZEN KANE is one of many films that have inspired me, others include David Lean's trifecta of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO; GONE WITH THE WIND, SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE LAST EMPEROR, and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. And, to a very lesser extent, I'll even say TITANIC and, maybe (though I hope not), the upcoming PEARL HARBOR. Though PRISONER OF WAR will be much more heartbreaking and moving without being melodramatic than either TITANIC and PEARL HARBOR! (Yes, there are a lot of impressionable films!) And soon, so will my films be legendary, critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning, box-office smash-hit, epic classics.<br />Wow, that's a mouth full!<br />Back to CITIZEN KANE, a very inspirational film due to its groundbreaking techniques in camera angles (cinematography), dialogue, subject matter, shadows and lighting, and acting. <br />In 1941, Orson Welles, 26-years-old at the time, was given permission by RKO Radio to produce a film of his choosing. He decided to write a scandalous story loosely based on the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, actress Marion Davies. Controversial at the time because of the backlash that the film and Welles received when word got to Hearst of this picture depicting his life. Hearst tried many ways to get this film from ever being shown: He tried to buy the negatives from RKO in order to burn them; he tried to slam the film in all his newspaper, and even had Louella Parsons, a powerful critic at the time, slam the film in her columns. For more on this story, check out the 1999 film &quot;RKO 281.&quot;<br />Welles, along with Herman Mankiewicz(brother of Oscar-winning director Joseph L. Mankiewicz), both collaborated in writing the script. Welles, who starred as the &quot;hero&quot; Charles Foster Kane, also acted as the director and producer, bringing in his Mercury Theater stage troupe from New York to fill in the parts for his film. They were: Joseph Cotten, as Kane's friend Jedediah Leland, the newspaper's drama critic; Everett Sloane as Kane's nerdy assistant, Mr. Bernstein; Agnes Moorehead, as Kane's mother Mrs. Mary Kane; Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander Kane; Ruth Warrick as Kane's first wife, Emily Norton Kane; Ray Collins as Kane's rival in politics, &quot;Boss&quot; Jim W. Gettys; Erskine Sanford as the befuddled Herbert Carter; Paul Stewart as Raymond the butler; and George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the man who takes little Charlie from his mother and father, played by Harry Shannon. <br />It begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane with his final words &quot;Rosebud.&quot; This meaning is the basis for the film, as a mystery, film-noir, and as a character study with little bits of comedy in it (supplied by Erskine Sanford's character). The film is basically told in flashback, going from his childhood in 1878 to his death in 1941. Revered as America's own Kublai Khan, living in seclusion in his castle Xanadu, which was taken from Hearst's own real-life private castle - San Simeon. We learn of Kane's rise to power, as a simple newspaper owner to a political-hopeful man, to his downfall when he is disovered to have an affair with a struggling singer, who eventually becomes his second wife. More sad news, his first wife, Emily, and son Charles III, were killed in an auto accident. Told by his friends, Jed Leland and Mr. Bernstein, and by his second wife, the shadowed figure of a man named Jerry Thompson (William Alland) uncovers each secret that reveals some truth to the myth of Charles Foster Kane. <br />In the end, we find out what &quot;Rosebud&quot; meant. His sled, which was prominent in the beginning, was a reminder of his lost childhood. He never wanted the money, only love! But, according to Leland, he wanted &quot;love on his own terms,&quot; which sadly costed him in the end. Truly thought-provoking and moving!<br />At the Academy Awards, Orson Welles received 4 personal nominations from CITIZEN KANE's 9 noms in 1941 for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Screenplay (with Herman Mmankiewicz), and Best Picture. The only award the film received was the Best Screenplay Oscar!<br />From the haunting score by Bernard Herrmann to the shadowy photography by Gregg Toland to the fast-paced editing by future Oscar-winning director Robert Wise (WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC), CITIZEN KANE proved to be a film way ahead of its time; as well as a film that could stand among the very best!<br />Orson Welles's debut proved to be his most powerful and influential.
B000002GJ7|5.0|I was really late, discovering these guys.  Sure I had heard &quot;more than words&quot; and &quot;hole hearted&quot; but I always just kinda blew them off.  In 1994, the heyday of grunge and doom-rock,  A musician friend of mine turned me on to Extreme.  It seems that most guitar players listen to these guys because of Nuno Bettencourt's guitar playing.  It's pretty amazing.  To me these guys came across like a breath of fresh air.  This album is full of suprises.  The guitar playing is some of the best I have EVER heard and Gary Cherone's vocals are solid.  My only problem is actually keeping a copy.  They always get &quot;borrowed&quot; by my friends.  After seven years, this album has never gotten old.  One thing that seperates Extreme from the rest of the bands to come from their era (Poison, Whitesnake, Kix, SLaughter) aside from talent, is their song-writing skills.  They sang about more than just driving fast cars and getting laid.  Their debut album was good, but this is way better.  <br />It's still nice, in a world full of Godsmacks and Slipknots, to be able to throw something like this in the player from time to time.  Great album.
B000000OAA|5.0|To me this, Queen II and A Night At the Opera are Queen's best albums. Not one bad track on here. I don't want to take too long on this review so I'll do a short summary of each track. &quot;Brighton Rock&quot;, Queen doing heavy metal and is a great track. It has a 2-minute Brian May guitar solo. &quot;Killer Queen&quot;, I think everyone knows this one as it was a hit for the band. &quot;Tenement Funster&quot;, is a Roger Taylor sung rocker. &quot;Flick Of The Wrist&quot;, is mad scientist meets heavy metal. &quot;Lily Of The Valley&quot;, is a tender ballad. I swear, if you were to listen to Freddie's vocals on this track in extreme slow motion (just keep pressing the pause button on the cd player rapidly off and on), his voice sounds as if he was a roman or arabian god overseas of some sought. He was so amazing. &quot;Now I'm Here&quot;, another heavy rocker that turned into a hit. &quot;In The Lap Of The Gods&quot;, is a mini-opera of some sought. &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, fast-paced heavy metal. &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, is a beautiful voice and piano song. &quot;Misfire&quot;, is hard for me to explain. It's like island music. &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot;, is something of a prog-rock mix of ragtime jazz, ukelele and Queen's brand of camp which is excellent. &quot;She Makes Me&quot;, is a mellow Brian May sung tune. &quot;In the Lap Of the Gods..Revisited&quot;, is a great ending to a terrific album.<br />Queen is my favorite band for a reason, and by the way, they just got inducted into the previous Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony. It's about time.<br />thanks.
B000002G0P|5.0|Extreme's self titled debut album was a mixture of anthem shouting, party rock mixed with mind blowing guitar riffs.  Extreme II Pornografitti had more meaning.  It still had the great party-rock thing going on, mixing in a little bit of Faith No More/Chili Peppers funk with even BETTER guitar playing all around this concept of finding love in a less than friendly era. <br /> Extreme III Sides to Every Story is unlike anything they (or any other band, for that matter) have ever done.  In short, this album is truly a masterpiece.  It is wholly original and cannot be classified.  I don't EVEN know what to compare this to.  The band was on to something here.   This has been called an anti-war concept, but I think it runs MUCH deeper than that.  It is broken into three sections and then all tied together in the end.  <br />Yes, this sounds like a totally different band altogether when compared to their last two efforts.  I'm not sure what audience this was intended for but it has found it's place in my collection.  This is a piece of musical genius that has never been repeated.  I fell in love with it the first time I listened to it all the way through and I'm sure that anyone who isn't concerned with image or the flavor of the week can appreciate it also.  <br />Please, if you only buy one album for the rest of the year, forget about what's going on in the mainstream right now and pick this up.  It's an experience from beginning to end.
B000002G87|4.0|With the exception of the Beatles as solo artists, no rock star has had his work judged in light of what he produced before as Eric Clapton. At the time of its release, this album came as a disappointment to many Clapton fans, who saw it as a step down from his blistering megawattage days with Cream. It almost seems silly to think that such a criticism could be found with Derek and the Dominos. Sure, this may not be the tinitus-inducing acid rock of Disraeli Gears days, but the guitar work here is just as groundbreaking. And that may be the problem. For all the hoopla about rock changing the world, especially in those days, the truth is that most fans want their rock heroes to stay neatly in the box that the fans have defined for them. Clapton has never accepted such confinement, and thank God, or we never have such a fantastic recording as Layla.<br />Clapton created an almost ficticious blues bar band in Derek and the Dominos. But instead of packing the band with hacks to further his own ego, Clapton sought out excellent musicians who were each accomplished in their own right. And by whatever method the teaming actually occurred, nowhere is this more true than with Duane Allman. Clapton, like Paul McCartney, needs a musical equal to push and prod him to produce his best stuff, and for Clapton, Allman fulfills that role masterfully. From the screaming duels on Layla, to the achingly beautiful lines on I Am Yours, these are two kindered spirits driving each to greater heights. The result is fantastic.<br />If Clapton suffered at the time of this album's release with comparisons to Cream, he has paid a different price in the years since. Commercial radio has all but obliterated the impact of Layla from constant repitition to the point of banality. The freshness, the intensity, and the virtuosity on this song are lost due to the fact that everyone has heard it 10,000 times. It is really a pity because, like Stairway to Heaven, once all the hoopla is stripped away, what is left is a masterfully constructed piece of music performed by first rate musicians. If &quot;Layla&quot; has kept you from buying Layla, get it anyway and program your CD to block out the last song. There is plenty more on this album to enjoy.
B00005AR3G|5.0|The Emporer's New Groove is a very funny movie with few weak spots.  All of the main charactors (voiced by David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warburton) are completely outrageous.  Probably the funniest charactor in the movie is Kronk, who is voiced by Warburton.  He is the charactor in which the film's funniest gags are based opon.  This is not a traditional Disney movie.  It has no mushy love songs, no real moral message, and certainly no breathtaking animation.  It started out like that, but the idea was shelved and this hilarious movie was put together by Disney.  This is one of those movies that you watch after you just flunked a math test and need a good laugh.  David Spade does the voice of Cuzco perfectly-with just the right tone of sassiness and arrogence. The only weak spot of this movie is the fact that, towards the end of the movie, it seemed like the animators got tired or clumsy or something and the film looked kind of slapped together. Some sequences look like they came out out of a Looney Toons cartoon.  But even though the animation slacks off, the laughs keep on coming until the very last scene.
0792846338|5.0|The one and only reason to see this film is because of the phenomenal Kathy Bates. She earned an extremely well deserved Academy Award in 1990 for her performance as Annie Wilcox. It takes true talent to pull off the role that she did, and everyone knows NO other actress could have become Annie more superbly than Kathy Bates.  I have to admit, there is not much plot to this movie, because it's based on a Steven King movie, but Kathy Bates---&gt;&gt;&gt; she is PURE acting talent. Actresses like her come once in a lifetime.
B00001U0E1|4.0|Oh yes the movie is Great in many aspects:<br />1. Great acting job by Joseph Fiennes. I loved his spirit. His voice roars on theater as Romeo and the poems are a song of love.<br />2. The costumes are brilliantly made especially for the queen (Judi Dench) and beautiful Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br />3. Great directing job by (John Madden), great Screenplay and very touchy OST especially at the dancing party (I loved the music and dancing).<br />As an overall this is a nice romantic movie but I do not think it deserves all the Oscars fuss. Not that it's not good or a waste of time but you just can't justify all the awards! Still no matter what, I recommend watching this nice film.
B00005B36H|5.0|I just bought this CD today, but I cant tell that the boys did again. If all the bands faced music like this guys do, in a passionate and intense way, we wouldn't have to hear [bands] like Papa Roach, Backstreet boys, and so on...
B00004XONN|5.0|...and I love it. I don't know why, either, so I'm not really going to bother justifying it (I'm usually not the one to go for the seminal &quot;experiemntal&quot; albums bands put out). With the exception of Treefingers, the entire album *interests* me...and while some of the tracks might run a bit long (Kid A, for example), they still hold my attention. Sample it before buying, though; as the reviews seem to show, you might not have quite the same reaction.
B00005B36H|5.0|This albulm has a different attitude too what they have been saying on their other albulms. In my judgement this thought that they now have will inspire others too relize that the music industry has become corperate and we need a change in what we listen too on the radio. Tool does a wonderfull job creating music that will be heard and respected for years too come. If you like anima, this albulm though a bit different is still a must in your colection
0790729628|3.0|I saw Blade Runner in the theater years ago and thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time. The characters were struggling with the meaning of humanity itself in a dark futuristic setting. But all the darkness was worthwhile because in the end things work out very well for some of the characters. I definitely would have rated this movie with 5 stars.<br />When I learned that the DVD version was out, I immediately bought it and watched it. When it was over, I was outraged. They cut the good ending. The Director's cut was NOT the same as I saw in the theater. Because they didn't have another ending to put in, this version has no ending. It just suddenly quits. They also cut the narration throughout which served to explain the movie. Because I had already seen the movie in the theater, I didn't much miss the narration until the end of the climactic scene near the end on the rooftop. The narration there in the theater version really added a lot.<br />My recommendation is that if you want to see a dark 3-star movie, buy this. However, if you are expecting the great 5-star movie you saw in the theater, DON'T BUY THIS. I very much disagree with the review by Jim Emerson that says the director's cut was better than the original theater version. The movie executives knew best that the narration was needed to give viewers the full import of what was happening. They also knew that most people want a happy ending.<br />I also recommend that Blade Runner fans petition the studio to release the theatrical version to DVD. I'd buy that one in a second.
0440203856|5.0|DANIELLE Steel's Zoya looks like a big, sprawling saga of a novel, imbued with latent delights and gaily wrapped in a warm invitation to open and explore its enticing contents. And as we very well know, Steel never fails to deliver the kind of yarns that keep you turning the pages at an unflagging pace, the kind you can spend the weekend holed up with and put down feeling as though you have woken up from a deep and wonderful spell. From the cathedrals, domes, spires and ancient elegance of an Imperial Russia plunged into bloody revolution to the graceful splendour and swirling artistic excitement and bustle of Paris in the 1920s and ultimately to the cut-and-thrust world of corporate New York, Steel has managed to weave a tapestry of tragedy, hardship and triumph, of love and loss, and of searching and fulfilment without the obfuscating irrelevancies and loose ends that seem to plague novels of such genre.<br />Zoya is a sweeping saga of the crumbling or moribund glamour of the Russian aristocracy. Countess Zoya Ossupov, the fiery protagonist of the saga, was brought up in the opulence and extravagance of a St. Petersburg palace, a charmed and wondrous world that existed nowhere else, the vanishing world of Tsarist Russia. Hers was a magical life of palaces and balls, of men in brightly hued uniforms and beautiful women apparelled in elegant gowns and bedecked with diamond necklaces. But dark clouds are gathering in the horizon and as the Revolution engulfs Russia and all that it stands for, Zoya's whole family and those whom she holds dear are mercilessly massacred in the ensuing turmoil.<br />Leaving home and fortune behind, Zoya manages to escape to Paris with her aged, but spunky grandmother, the Countess Evgenia Ossupov, with whatever jewels they could salvage sewn into the linings of their clothes. Amidst the chaos and turbulence of a nation torn asunder, Zoya's fairytale world, like sandcastles in the air, crumbles to smithereens.<br />Paris was a whole new experience for her, filled with new principles, new responsibilities and new people. It was a constant struggle for survival and basic necessities were in dire scarcity. Under the shadow of the Great War and in time, Zoya falls passionately and fatefully in love and moves to a more affluent lifestyle in New York with the American captain, Clayton Andrews. However, her world comes crashing down again without warning during the Great Depression when Clayton commits suicide, leaving her with debts to settle and two children to raise. The Second World War looms ominously ahead, bringing with it more violent upheavals. The rising tides of war in Europe ebbs and flows as people and relationships are forced apart and flung together. Thus presented, Zoya sounds like a melodramatic parable. Yet, despite the heaviness of style, it is skilfully narrated. Steel is good at catching a historical mood and at describing the complex interrelationships between ordinary people thrown together by the winds of change in a world in turmoil.<br />Zoya is a story of hope and restored faith, a testament to the resilient and triumphant human spirit and to the restorative powers of love and that coming to terms with one's past, one's life and one's relationships is always a painful process. The path to glory and bliss is not one strewn with primroses but also with trials and tribulations. You will truly be enamoured by the subtly drawn, indomitable character of Zoya, one of Steel's more compelling female characters yet, an enchanting and audacious redhead whose eyes dance with emerald fire as you keep up with her fluctuating fortunes and battle for survival from the majesty and decadence of St. Petersburg to New York.<br />Despite its timeworn tale and the fact that it hardly breaks any new ground in literary wizardry, Zoya is a pretty engrossing potboiler and for this it owes to its narrative consistency, which is well-handled and tempered with restraint such that the incessant flow of eventsis kept in clear perspective till the very end. Much of the fascination with Zoya can be traced to its effective intermingling of high romance with undeniably well-drawn characters that linger in one's memory long after putting the novel down, well-woven descriptive passages, poignant moments and a richly-detailed backdrop of varying moods and ambience. The spirit and soul of the eternal and timeless city of Paris has been captured in a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours.<br />If you have enjoyed Steel's previous novels, you will definitely derive many hours of pleasure from digesting Zoya too. After all has been said, one is still inclined to regard the novel as a rather faithful though constipated version of its pulp.<br />You somehow know what to expect from a Danielle Steel novel. Yes, by reprising the tried-and-tested formulas that had served her well through the years: flawed characters, tangled lives and redemption. Those with an avaricious appetite for escapist fiction will find her book an interesting and compelling read. Somehow, by working within the conventions of her genre, her novel works, because there is something comfortingly familiar about each new Steel novel in that we know what we are going to get. Assuming no literary pretensions, she entertains us the best way she knows. And it all somehow makes sense.
B00005AR3G|4.0|Disney has another one to add to it's list of hits.  The Emperor's New Groove is a fun filled and entertaining movie to watch.  It's fun for all ages(pardon the cliche).  This is definitely one to add to the collection.  So...take my advice and give this movie a look.  You won't be sorry.  And for you videophiles out there, the DVD has plenty to offer you.
B000059WOD|5.0|This cd by Linkin Park is one of the best I ever bought. The famous singles from this cd is 'Crawling'and 'One step Closer'. There are many other good songs such as 'Papercut' and 'Forgottten'. There are two bonus tracks for Japan but this is sold all over the world. If you put this cd into  your computer, It will show you a music video of 'One Step Closer' in very good quality. I hope you buy this cd. It is very good.
B00004SCX6|1.0|ok, so I listened to my friend Kenny's Tape of this Album in his car and all I have to say is this album is so repeatitive.  Seriously, when I heard \\"What You see is What You Get\\"  I thought it was Oops I did it Again.  And Dear Diary? Lmao...that song is just so funny.  I guess she wrote it and the lyrics go as follows:<br />Dear Diary, Today I saw a boy and I wondered if he noticed me  he took my breath away<br />ok, you get it.  This album is awful...

0140277447|1.0|As for numbers murdered and raped in Nanking, Iris Chang spends so much time establishing an extraordinarily high figure with little evidence .<br />Although Chang refers to John Rabe's testimony for alleged Japanese Army's brutality, she never accept or even pay attention to the fact that he clearly mentioned, in his letter to Hitler in June 1938,  estimated number of civilian killed was between 50,000 to 60,000.<br />A little investigaton showed me that Miner Searle Bates, a member of the International Safety Zone Committee for Nanking, recorded that  estimated number killed was around 12,000 as reported to Tokyo Trial later. Also, Ku-Wei Chun mentioned 20,000 citizens were killed in his speech to the League of Nations on Feburary 2, 1938.<br />Anyway, some people may argue that the number of victim doesn't matter so much. But since Iris Chang herself put so much emphasis on this issue, she shoud have been fairer and provided readers with more data.
6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is probably the most artistic film I've ever seen. Care was put into every character, even the ones with minor, minor roles, and the sets were astounding. The fuildity of movement was incredible, and the music and scripts are without peer.<br />This film is undoubtably one of the greatest of the great movies, and is captured escellently on the Special Edition DVD. The DVD came out just in time, since my old copy of Nightmare Before Christmas was on tape, and begining to stretch. The DVD has fabulous extras, including theatrical trailors for the movie, and for James and the Giant Peach. I Thouroughly enjoyed watching &quot;The making of The Nightmare Before Christmas,&quot; one could see that they hadn't just thrown it together, but actually thought about how the &quot;making of&quot; part was going to be done.<br />One of my favortie parts of the DVD was teh extra short films, particularly &quot;Vincent.&quot; I loved the rhyming and the way things went from reality to Vincents imagination.<br />I HIGHLY reccomed this DVD to ANYONE who has a remote intrest.
B00005B1EX|4.0|With the acception of the samples from the Album to enhance Robs Vocals at the begining of the album,Two of three of the bonus tracks and the use of Fan Tracks on a few parts of the Album, this is a Good Live Record.You can realy feel the energy of the music,it is a fine production.A nice selection of tunes that covers all of Rob Halfords carrer,many priest Classics.I attended two shows on the &quot;Resurrection&quot; tour,and over all this album gives you a nice idea of what the live shou sounded like ,even down to what he said between songs.
0618135871|5.0|In &quot;The Dying Animal&quot; Roth gives us yet another masterful example of how one can utilize the pure and daily vernacular in a literary form.  Roth here, as he did in &quot;Sabbath's Theater,&quot; has raised the level of his pornographic imagery, to literary status.  Yet, the book really has little to do with Sex, and much more to do with Death.  Throughout the book, we are faced with a college professor who has had a long and intricate series of affairs with his students, just after they were no longer his students.  But, the protagonist focuses on one particular student and this student is a collage of past student affairs, which it is the reader's assumption that Roth has indeed experienced personally.<br />So then, what is Roth's complaint?  Not only is his perfect sexual animal a complete and total obsession for him, but in fact, Roth depicts her as potentially, the &quot;last&quot; student affair.  And, if in fact, if it is the last student affair, then it is more on the side of dying, than it is on the side of living.<br />Roth therefore is faced with a terrible dillema.  After 4 decades of obsessive sexuality with every and all types of women, he finds himself allied with the concept that ultimately, when the sex ends; the dying starts.  Roth wages battle within his mind, to overcome this inevitability, but he is nonetheless, stuck with the conclusion, that as his sex life draws to a close, so to, does his mortal life.  As in &quot;Portnoy's Complaint&quot;, Roth once again returns to the image that sex is synonymous with life, and lack of sex is synonymous with death.  But, rather than Portnoy's conclusion, that it is now time to begin, here Roth seems to be saying, it is now time to start to end.  Once one no longer can experience that human ecstasy, then that person's life is drawing to conclusion.  He leaves the question unresolved for himself, as is not unusual for Roth, as to whether he should accept his oncoming death and start to adapt, or whether to remain in denial, until it is no longer deniable.  <br />Once again, Roth gives us a legacy, which, if it has any flaw at all, would be the shortness of the work.  Normally, Roth would give us a fuller understanding of the other characters in the book, but in this case, perhaps, it was only the protagonist's thoughts that really mattered to Roth, and thus, the actual persona of his other characters was superfluous to his message.  This is a highly recommended read, and will allow the reader to absorb a complex message in a slight and incredibly well written 150 pages.
B000002HRE|1.0|The transformation that surrounded James, Kirk, Lars and Newsted is something really amazing, something to be studied by scholars !! How a band changes direction so hardly and begin to being so commercial, is almost unbeliavable. I have nothing against trying new approaches, but Metallica later albuns are so heartless, formulatic, Kirk Hammett is playing his worst ever, Lars drums seems a machine, so boring it is. As for James, he still can write some of the best riffs around, but I think hes guarding them somewhere .... FORGET ABOUT METALLICA.
630460288X|3.0|DEMOLTION MAN is perhaps one of the dumbest of the &quot;dumb action&quot; action movies, due to it's dialouge and handle on how a near future society might behave and act.  DEMOLITION MAN is also a lot of fun, not the most fun I've ever had at a movie, but fun nonetheless in part to the film's at times, dumb nature.<br />Stallone's character Officer John Spartan has finally captured his arch nemisis Simon Phoenix (Snipes) and locked him up.  However, Spartan's often brutal practices on the job along with Phoenix's evil attitude have landed them both into a cryogenic rehabilitation.  Both can re-enter society when their rehab is deemed complete.<br />It is now the early part of the 21st century and Phoenix has been broken out of his cryo-prison and is running amok in a super-peacy society that can't control him.  (Cops don't carry guns only batons, using profanity can get you fined, Taco Bell won the &quot;Francize War&quot; and is the only restaurant around and don't even ask about sex, it's weird.) The local San Angeles (you heard right,) police force needs to unleash Spartan so he can restore order and stop Phoenix.  Spartan is viewed as either a gunslining old-tyme hero by some or as a brow furrowing caveman by the others.  Spartans new partner Huxley (Sandra Bullock, pre SPEED) is assigned as his partner and helps Spartan adjust to his new surroundings as they together must stop Phoenix's chaos streak.<br />Certainly not the greatest action movie out there, but for a action fan, it has plenty of action to keep one entertained.  Especially one who is a fan of the Future Society action movie.  A step either ahead or behind Stallone's JUDGE DREDD but with both behind CLIFFHANGER.  Two little notes before I move on.  1 &quot;Murder,Death,Kill&quot; is the dumbest expression I may have ever heard in a movie. 2  Am I alone in thinking that Sandra Bullock looks cute in that cop outfit of hers?
6301871952|5.0|I'd been wanting to see this movie for over 10 years.  I was only 7 when it was released to video.  Everytime we went to the video store I would see the cover to this movie.  The chair, the claw marks, the green scaly hand with the cigar...I was captivated.  But, alas, my parents wouldn't get it; they said it would be too scary.<br />Well, just a few months ago, I was starved for entertainment.  Then, at SUNCOAST, there it was.  GREMLINS 2:  THE NEW BATCH, on sale.  I snapped it up and drove right home to view it.<br />Oh Lord, was I not disappointed.<br />Once the movie was over, I was still laughing my head off half-an-hour later.<br />While it helps to have seen the original, it is not necessary (for example, I haven't).  This movie begins rather slowly, re-introducing us to various characters.<br />But once Gizmo gets wet, the movie goes into overdrive.<br />In my opinion, the funniest part was the intelligent Brain Gremlin and his big musical number near the end.  I don't want to spoil it, so I won't reveal the exact details.<br />Highly recommended!
B00004RE7C|4.0|Star Trek 3 is on par with INSURECTION as the best of the odd numbered Treks and serves as a great action adventure for the old cast.<br />SEARCH picks up right where WRATH OF KHAN left off, Khan is dead, Spock is dead, the Genisis planet is in full bloom and has sparked controversy all over the galaxy, and the Enterprise is chugging home after it's near destruction only to see that it is to be retired with Kirk and his crew having to pursue less interesting work.  The problems don't stop there, Dr. McCoy is slowly going insane from Spocks mindmeld and at the Genisis planet, a Klingon pirate ship led by Captain Kruge are out to seize the secrets of this new planet which Kruge belives is a Starfleet weapon and in the process captures Kirk's son David and the regenerated Spock.<br />Spocks father comes before Kirk and tells him that if he wants to save McCoy, he must reunite him with Spock and have them taken to Vulcan so that they may both be restored, but Genisis is off limits and Kirk knows this but he can't let his friends down, so he and the rest of the crew assemble to steal the Enterprise, putting their lives and jobs at risk and rescue Spock and end up having to sacrifice the Enterprise to save the day.  A good pace throughout most of the movie, SEARCH is often underrated and overlooked by the other movies, 2, 4, 6, and FIRST CONTACT.  It shouldn't be as it can hold a candle to each of these movies, often a dimmed candle though.<br />SEARCH does have two demerrits, the sets of the film are worse then any of the other Trek films.  Old Atari style graphics and computers are the computer displays and tacky brick a brak colors and corny lighting to make up most of the ship layouts. Also, when at the end the crew arives at Vulcan, the movie grinds slowly to it's eventual conclusion.  Another minus.<br />Star Trek 3 is a great film for every trek fan and holds the title probably the best odd numbered Trek.  (Well, lets see how the revamped MOTION PICTURE looks and we can decide further.)nd we can decide further.)
6304466498|5.0|The great Mr. Brooks has, unfortunately, been on a decline with his last several movies.  &quot;Spaceballs&quot; is the last one to have the same hilarity as &quot;The Producers&quot; and &quot;Young Frankenstein.&quot;<br />All of the reviewers before me have said most of what I wish to say, so let me just draw attention to one point.  As in many of the best movies, the villains really steal the show.<br />George Wyner is an extremely underrated actor who, as Colonel Sandurz, goes just over-the-top enough to endear himself to the audience without being annoying.  He has some of the best scenes.<br />Mel Brooks is a delight as President Skroob.  &quot;I can't make decisions!  I'm a President!&quot;<br />And Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet...whoever cast him should be praised.  Casting one of the most harmless actors in screen history (just watch him in LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) as an evil planet-destroying villain is the icing on the cake.  He really makes this film.
0345440757|5.0|I am a mother of three sons, and I can honestly say that I wish this book would've been around when my youngest was born.  Fortunately for me, my boys have all been &quot;textbook&quot; babies, but Tracey's advice is SO helpful.  I was using Tracey's EASY plan without really realizing it, and it does work.  I found her section on infant massaging very informative and helpful.  I also really liked the format of the book.  The narratives made for a more interesting read, and the small &quot;tip&quot; sections were an easy way to catch the really important stuff.  I really enjoyed the book and read it cover to cover!!
0060264306|5.0|These are labeled as children's books and children may like or love them. Though in my experience, adults seem to like and appreciate them much more. These are good stories, and they are fascinating. The writing is simple yet articulate and very easy to picture, so they ARE great children's books. All you ever wanted to know about the life of that time period is right here. Okay it's true that these books and the television show that came from it is as much a moral lesson for children as a compelling group of stories.<br />It's almost like a lesson in respect and courage and family in every chapter of the series, kind of like the show. Though this first book is just a starter, it's mostly about the process of day to day life. I can say be careful to parents that want to read this to children not old enough to read this themselves though. If you are at all cautious of or worried about telling your younger children of certain practices like curing meat or something like that for whatever reason, then this may not be a book to buy. I suggest that if you have any reservations about how your children would react to hearing things like how Laura and Mary used an air filled and tied up pig bladder as a ball [By far the most explicit thing in the book and only mentioned for a paragraph or two] then maybe you should get this book from the library and proof read it first. Remember though this is mostly a nice series it is a dose of reality from a tough time in American history where each person or family had to make what they had and survive off the land if they were in the more unsettled territories. If you do like this book for yourself and or your children, or enjoy the show then you will probably like all the other books as well. They all pretty much come to the same thing - survival, family, respect, learning to get along with others, and hardwork.<br />In the books to follow, the troubles and every day life can be very surprising, and becomes more about experiences then the process of many daily practices that are in this first book. I personally never watched the show through my childhood out of ill will for anything that reminded me of a hokey television way to teach me something, like alot kids do.  I dismissed the show itself as a serious and more lecturing version of the Brady bunch [ nothing against that show, just not my cup of tea.] This is not the Brady Bunch though. The show wasn't the Brady Bunch and neither is the book. Though this is just a woman's memories of being a little girl in a good family, there are some serious life experiences here that anybody can relate to now. The relations between whites and blacks and the American Indians are very clear in the series to follow. It may come across as vague or non existent to a child at times during the series of books, but as an adult you get an appreciation for the way people felt back then, tension and all. Even if you only like this book a little, the series gets better and better. More story, more troubles, more history on the people in it build on each other and develop in a simple but interesting way. It doesn't drag on, or insult anyone's intelligence young or old. This is a fine quick read that is followed up by an even finer read.<br />P.S. This is definetely not a gender or age specific thing. I Hope this review helped.en the process of many daily practices that are in this first book. I personally never watched the show through my childhood out of ill will for anything that reminded me of a hokey television way to teach me something, like alot kids do.  I dismissed the show itself as a serious and more lecturing version of the Brady bunch [ nothing against that show, just not my cup of tea.] This is not the Brady Bunch though. The show wasn't the Brady Bunch and neither is the book. Though this is just a woman's memories of being a little girl in a good family, there are some serious life experiences here that anybody can relate to now. The relations between whites and blacks and the American Indians are very clear in the series to follow. It may come across as vague or non existent to a child at times during the series of books, but as an adult you get an appreciation for the way people felt back then, tension and all. Even if you only like this book a little, the series gets better and better. More story, more troubles, more history on the people in it build on each other and develop in a simple but interesting way. It doesn't drag on, or insult anyone's intelligence young or old. This is a fine quick read that is followed up by an even finer read. <br />P.S. This is definetely not a gender or age specific thing. I Hope this review helped.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I was so excited to learn that one of my favorite bands had a new CD coming out. I could hardly wait!! But it was well worth it. If you like (or LOVE as in my case) DM then you'll like this CD. It's all new and yet it's still DM. I'd say it matches up well with Violator (their best CD ever). GET THIS CD!!
B000002J09|5.0|Where would the world of rock and roll be today if it was not for led zeppelin? friends, let me ask you this, how many more times will we get to see a band with such an impact and kashmir as led zeppelin? probably never again!<br />After two decades since their disband, heartbreaker, and three decades since they formed, a celebration day, the song remains the same, they were, and still is, the best thing that ever happened in the music world. from over the hills and faraway, england to be exact, they crossed the ocean with an immigrant song, and a whole lotta love, to instill us the notion of dazed and confused, music as we knew it would never be the same. there was no communication breakdown, the message was clear. in a battle of evermore for the crown in the rock world, led zeppelin came out on top by showing us all of what is and what should never be.<br />From light to shade, led zepelin was able to explore many musical styles. with jimmy page doing the misty mountain hop, robert plant going to california, john bonham holding four sticks, and john paul jones, who trampled under foot; led zeppelin as a whole, can be as soft as a tangerine or as a powerful force as when the levee breaks. either ways, that's the way we're gonna groove.<br />I don't feel like a fool in the rain at all for saying this, but my black dog might, ever since i've been loving you, the presence of your music really makes me feel alive in both good times, bad times. if i ever get a chance to see you live, i am gonna crawl if i have to. And so, from the bottom of our hearts, millions of fans around the globe, and with all my love, we thank you led zeppelin, for all your wearing and tearing. and if there is ever a stairway to heaven, we certainly could not make it there without your music. so, ramble on LED ZEPPELIN!
0446677450|1.0|A miserably bad book. Full of inaccurate and unethical information, some of it illegal. He often leaves out critically pertinent info to make his scenerios seem better.  For an accurate, in-depth review of this book read John T. Reed's review at his website: Johntreed.com.
B000002J03|3.0|LED ZEPPELIN II is thE album that convinced at least one generation of teenage boys that they could play the electric guitar. Years later we all realized that we were operating on a different planet than Jimmy Page.<br />These are riffs that thunder along, but they also have some swing.  Black Sabbath and Deep Purple never quite figured out that the secret to Led Zeppelin was that they weren't just out to make you bang your head; they could make you swing your hips as well.<br />LED ZEPPELIN II wasn't the artistic peak for the band.  That was still several years away.  But it was the last time Page would give his fans an all-out heavy metal guitar attack for a while.  The band's next two LPs--III and IV, oddly enough--would find Page adding layers and textures to the bands big sound.
6301247485|1.0|I had not seen the film in many years and recently rented this video. I was shocked to find that the muscial score had been changed. It also appeared to me that the car crash scene had been altered.<br />When I returned to the video store, I looked on the box. In fine print at the bottom it said something to the effect &quot;Not original music&quot;!<br />I don't know what happened to this picture when it was transferred to video but it's not the same. I'd be interested in hearing if anyone else noticed this and if they know what happened to this movie.
B000002J1U|3.0|Generally considered the band's first 'soft' step, LED ZEPPELIN III is, in fact, a pretty 'hard' LP.  &quot;Immigrant Song,&quot; &quot;Celebration Day,&quot; &quot;Since I've Been Loving You,&quot; and &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot; are pretty heavy stuff--not exactly Fairport Convention.<br />But Page was beginning to give Plant, he of the golden locks and hippy-dippy love songs, a bigger voice on Zeppelin records.  The results were some of Led Zeppelin's finest moments: records with hard edges, soft mushy centers, and that big whompin' John Bonham core.<br />And, if all else failed, Page would lay down another stunning guitar solo, as he does on &quot;Tangerine,&quot; a premonition of the sound the band would perfect on it's masterpiece, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI, a few years later.<br />III is a transition piece, but a very good one, with several magical moments.
0064407667|5.0|If you are the type of person who blames everyone but yourself for the evils of the world, by all means DON'T read these books.  However, if you have a healthy sense of reality and humor (or want to raise children who will!) then read and enjoy these delightful tales.<br />Lemony Snicket writes for all those kids who know that adults aren't always on their side.  His stories are funny, a little creepy and always interesting.  The Baudelaire children are the best of what boy and girl heros in books should be and the adults, well, the adults might just be portrayed a little too accurately for some grown-ups to handle.  As most children know, adults don't always do what's right, aren't always to be trusted and don't always believe what a child tells them.  Reading some of the negative reviews here, some adults would prefer that children not know this.  Silly grown-ups, your children already  know far more than you understand.<br />My daughter and I have read book the first and are rapidly demolishing book the second.  They are smart books the way Roald Dahl books are smart.  The author explains a lot of words or phrases, but not, in my opinion,  in a &quot;dumbing down&quot; way.  Many of the explainations are useful even for adults who know what the words already mean... for example, the explaination of &quot;literal&quot; vs. &quot;figurative&quot; in book the first.<br />Enjoy the books and read them along with your kids.  You'll be amazed at how much this writing stikes a chord with them!
B000002JSP|3.0|Generally dismissed by critics, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR actually has several great moments, among them the glittering entrance of Page's lead guitar on &quot;In The Evening,&quot; and the drifting instrumental break a few moments later.  Plant's throaty vocals on &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; are pretty amazing, and the throb of &quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; is pretty hard to ignore too.<br />The only really sour passage here is &quot;Fool In The Rain,&quot; one of the most annoying songs ever recorded by a great band.<br />But, when set in the context of &quot;All My Love&quot; and &quot;Carouselambra,&quot; it's only a small drop of annoyance in a larger pool of good.  IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR is not the typical Led Zeppelin record, but it isn't nearly as bad as critics would have you believe.
B0000042H4|4.0|I must agree with the other reviewers about the recording engineer and his gimmicks with the score.  Having heard Birgit Nilsson live, I am happy to have her recorded in this Solti rendition.  My preference, however, is for Karajan.  Karajan's Walkure is by far a better production.  Gundula Janowitz is magnificent as Sieglinde; no one else even comes close.  I own both the Solti and the Karajan recordings, and I find myself listening more often to the Karajan set.  When I'm in the mood for volume and special effects, I put on Solti.  When it's lyricism and romanticism I'm after, Karajan hits the spot.
6305718954|1.0|This movie is stupid. The moment you apply any thought it starts falling apart.<br />The basic premise is that Patricia Arquette becomes possessed through obtaining a rosary, not just any rosary, that of a priest his partionners considdered worthy of sainthood. She then starts channeling the priest and becomes subject not only to demonic attacks but attacks by God.<br />One of my first problems is that the demonic attacks are nothing compared to the job God is supposed to be doing to her. The dogmatic line is that God is good, just and loving, but that he will inflict these terrible attacks on you (through a rosary, no less). There is no resolution for this, saying only that the stigmata is reserved for those of deepest faith and fidelty for religion. Patricia Arquette's character does not even believe in God which sets up an enormous contradiction that is never resolved.<br />Secondly, a large part of this is based around recognition for &quot;The Gospel of Thomas&quot; which is supposed to be controversial and hidden by the Vatican. &quot;The Gospel of Thomas&quot; was a piece of Gnostic work, they were sect of non Christians who used Jesus as an icon or character because he fit so nicely with their own beliefs. The Gnostics wrote of Jesus some two hundred years after his death using the names of the Apostles to drive home a point.<br />Gabriel Byrne's priest (and normally I'm a huge fan of Gabriel Byrne) is vascillating, indecisive and an almost direct rip off of Damian Caress from &quot;The Excorcist&quot;; a priest questioning his faith who is suddenly slapped in the face with overwhelming (and scary) evidence.<br />While Patricia Arquette gave an excellent preformance, there was no meat in her character. Nowhere in the midst of all this spiritual assault does she come to question her own beliefs. There is absolutely no growth, resolution or even curiosity in this character as to her prior beliefs or what this means to her. All we are served is surface fluff onwhat's coming for the next assualt.<br />This movie can only function if you completely shut down your brain. It constantly contradicts itself in ways that not even Ed Wood let go. It might be worth a rental for the special effects, but leave it at the store and save your money.
B00004RFCM|4.0|As a straight single male who confesses to being baffled by most women's personalities, I found this first series was full of intrigue and some surprises. <br /> It would seem that single women, as well as men, lead lives of (sometimes) quiet desparation. Here you have 4 women, 3 of which constantly claim to be looking hard for \\"Mr. Right\\" for the fulfillment of marriage. The 4th's closet tendencies in this direction come to light as well. <br /> So, what are some of the earth shaking problems several of the oft-cited otherwise PERFECT men have (which make them unacceptable husband material)? One twenty-something just isn't quite smooth and sophisticated enough - somewhat puppy-like socially. Another (how shocking) would like to have his partner engage in oral sex with him. A third commits the unpardonable sin of being \\"too small\\" - and sadly the solution his very experienced partner comes up with is crying instead of talking to him about it. And finally, the dreaded failure to commit to lifelong plans soon enough, despite being completely candid about where he stands and some of the negative life-experiences he's had to explain his position.<br /> Sorry girls, but if this is even a vague hint of the truth, it's little wonder it's so hard to find \\"true love\\" these days. There are no \\"perfect\\" men (or women) of course. <br /> There are certainly epiphanies one can understand and relate to. The classic stereotype of the 30-something woman waking up after a sleepover sex-date in the CLASSIC 20-something bachelor's apartment, and morning drivel-macho-rant he spouts was a riot, and right-on for far too many of my former friends in bygone years, for example. The too-sad pregneant suburbia mom-to-be that we learn how much she HATES her post-single-wild life, despite all her bluster to the contrary to her new-mom peers the day before sounded like it had a ring of truth. <br /> Looking forward to the second season DVD release (I never watch HBO). I hope the characters and the subjects continue to develop, and explore a wider variety of themes.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Imagine doing the Ed Sullivan show and being scheduled to go on right after the Beatles or Elvis.  That's how it must've felt for the makers of the second sequel to ALIEN.  Viewed on it's own, however, ALIEN3 is a smart, brooding, suspenseful, exciting, great looking and well acted piece of science fiction cinema.  But compared with all the other ALIEN films (Resurrection included) it is somewhat depressing and slow-paced.  It would have been better if the several characters from ALIENS had carried over further into this film with Ripley.  As it is the storyline is somewhat limited.  One thing the movie does have is spooky atmosphere.  It looks fanastic on DVD.  All that orange!  The picture is nearly flawless.  Equally good is the 5.1 sound.  Weaver, Dutton, Dance and Henriksen all turn it great performances too.  Don't let the dismal reviews discourage you.  ALIEN3 is not the adreneline rush of ALIENS, but it does borrow a lot from the original.  If you remember, a LOT of time passed in ALIEN before you even saw a creature.  Even though ALIEN3 is my least favorite, my collection wouldn't be complete without it.<br />Less DVD extras than the first two films.  Don't expect much in that area and you won't be disappointed.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Everything you could ever want to see or know about T2.  All kinds of special effects.  Watching the movie with all the deleted scenes made for a whole different movie ... one I found to be even better than the original.  I literally spent about 90 minutes just playing with the DVD watching bios, behind the scenes and trailers.  Just packed full of great stuff!
B00000ILDE|5.0|Forget that you've seen it before; watching the ALIENS Special Edition DVD is almost like seeing it for the first time.  The new added scenes range from interesting to breathtaking.  I've seen other re-edited films for DVD (Brazil for one) and have mostly wished they'd been left alone.  But here we have an impossible case of perfection made better.  The back of the DVD case says the new footage (17 minutes worth) was added to &quot;broaden the narrative scope and enrich the emotional impact of the film&quot;.  Does it?  Yessiree!  I do have one minor gripe about this &quot;special&quot; version.  There's a scene near the end where even an average viewer can see how a special effect was done.  My disbelief is always challenged at the moment.  I was hoping they'd use some computer-aided matting similar to the enhancments made in the Star Wars Trilogy to remove this.<br />How about the quality of the DVD transfer?  Well, it's tough to find much fault.  There is a little graininess or blockiness here and there but the picture quality is mostly quite sharpe.  The creatures look amazingly icky!  The sound is 5.1 perfection.  Turn it up!<br />The DVD interface is very creative just like the ALIEN DVD.  There's some interesting extras to sort through; although not as much as the ALIEN DVD.  The Cameron interview is very good (who is that interviewing him?  One of the Beach Boys?).<br />Perhaps the best SF/Horror picture ever done; becomes the #1 MUST BUY Dvd!
0783222955|3.0|Though the film today seems somewhat dated and oversimplified in its views of racism, many powerful moments still shine through and Badham is very charming as Scout, who's point of view the story is told from. One particularly beautiful scene that I remember is the film's finale which involves her and Robert Duvall finally meeting in a personal, heartfelt way. Gregory Peck isn't terrific (and how did Peter O'Toole lose the Oscar to him?!) but fairly good.
0345350472|5.0|A great, dark book which raises serious questions about replicating human an our direction as a species. A fine read. Will leave you thinking for days.<br />also try: Wildflower, by Carl Rafala and Noir by J Jeter
B000005JA8|3.0|There is nothing that will prepare someone for this CD by Captain Beefheart, other than a good sense of humour.  Trout Mask Replica is clever, perhaps too much so.  Dated, yet, a landmark.  Produced by Frank Zappa, it would be easy to dismiss as self-indulgent excess if it weren't that Mr Zappa and so many others were influenced.  It's not all fun and games as there is a serious undertoe on some of the songs such as &quot;Veteran's Day Poppy&quot;.  If you are interested in bizarre, music from southern california of the sixties, this is it.  My smile is stuck
B00003CXA2|5.0|As chocolate, this movie is woulderful. It's about a southerner Forrest Gump(Hanks) and most of his life. Most of the movie is him setting on a bench and telling his life story. About 10 or 20 min. before the end it is going on then and he is not telling a story. This movie really should not be rated PG-13, the only thing is then lauguage and some war violence. This movie is touching, funny, exciting, and sad. You should watch this movie as soon as posoble if you have not already seen it. You will love it. I hope this review helped. Bye.
B00005B6C9|5.0|Much better than Still Waters.<br />Great hooks .... great harmonies<br />Sacred Trust, Wedding Day, Embrace ...<br />and NO falsetto
B00004XQP4|5.0|First off I'm SICK of hearing Greenday &quot;fans&quot; scream 'sell-out' b/c ONE album isnt exactly what they like. Any true GD fan should be ashamed of criticizing a group that stayed true to themselves, even if they (GD) themselves changed. <br />I am like most ppl in saying their first CDs were awesome, even Insomniac. WARNING is a terrific album both lyrically and musically, and is easily the most listenable of any Greenday CD. Anyone who says the 3-chord power songs didnt get at least a TINY bit old is lying. That's why Nimrod was such a success, b/c they made it more interesting, just as they have here.<br />BS&amp;B, Castaway, Jackass and Minority are all awesome songs, and good old GD. COS is good also as is Deadbeat Holiday and MDP. Waiting and the title track are both weak and annoying, and overall just garbage songs. The rest is nothing fantastic, but it's good solid music nonetheless. And GD still has the funny lyrics and good baselines that we love.<br />I think we can all agree that the main reason why we love or loved Greenday is because they were original and because they were real. COS, MDP and even Hold On are relative to BJ's life, and are REAL. I think Fashion Victim might've been a token song for us, but the rest IS Greenday, pure and true. Billie Joe once again, like in the beginning of his career, went against the crowd and came out w/ HIS music. He knew he'd ruffle some feathers w/ Warning, just as he did w/ Dookie and the Lookout! Records CDs, but he stayed true to himself. This isnt a group trying to be something it's not , and for that, I applaud them. Buy and enjoy this CD because it's terrific music, not because you're a punk-junkie living in the past.
068484267X|5.0|This book truly is a masterpeice. I loved the way Frank McCourt wrote the way a seven year old would think when he was explaining this life as a seven year old, and his perspective on things really made me think about my life as a whole, and how lucky I really am, I Reccomend this book to all who have the time to read it, and I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00000BKE0|2.0|In all honesty I would give this 2 1/2 stars, 3 stars if I could bump off like 3 of the tracks and add ANYTHING else. I had this years ago and recently re-bought it b/c A. I wanted it again, B. because of the added media stuff. And actually the added media stuff is excellant and even makes me want to repurchase the catalog, the Holy Smoke video included on the cd is a nice touch and is funny. As another reviewer wrote, the solos are very good on this, what holds me back on this cd is the title track. I think No Prayer for the Dying is a nice concept, fantastic cover art, but ultimately a weak song. It's tough to build a cd around a poor song, not that it's bad, it's just not that good, and there is a difference.<br />Powerslave for instance, when you heard the song Powerslave you would have guessed that was the title track whether you knew it or not! It was that powerful and that good.<br />Songs on N.P.F.T.D. I could have done without: Tailgunner (it's a good song but it's a remake of... Aces High)  Fates Warning: Dull: Hooks In You: Jesus, I have a sense of humor but this is just plain bad. I also find Mother Russia to be very mechanical, and the cheap keyboard sound doesn't help much.<br />I actually like Bring Your Daughter and Holy Smoke and think the cd would have benefitted had the disc been written with consistancy, these songs are conspicious when surrounded by the likes of &quot;The Assassin&quot;, this song is so serious and the other two are not. This disc desperately needs an identity.
B0000027I6|5.0|A stunning piece of work that must be absorbed like a movie ... in one sitting, preferably in the dark, with your total attention.  Definitely not car radio music!  The layers of sound provoke vivid images and the lyrics are razor sharp.  By the end, you will be emotionally exhausted ... and amused to death.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|If I were to rate this on only musicianship, packaging and production I could bump this up a star, but sadly all is not well. Lyrically, this album is weak. I suppose when all else fails, repeat a chorus, except that the chorus's aren't interesting. There are several bridges where it would have been better to actually say something of substance than repeat the same thing over and over. A for instance? The song the Mercenary, which is a good one but it wears thin with lines like; &quot;Show them no fear, show them no pain&quot; (times 4!) I do not see the need to repeat this same line (said the same way) 4 times! Talk about filler! Some of the lyrics just flat out do not make much sense. Another thing that bugged me was for some reason all the songs sound as though they are written in the same key or Bruce converts each song to the same key. <br />High points are the extremely smooth time changes, Bruces voice clarity, the song lengths (yet rarely seem to drag), and of coarse a reunion of sorts within the band. I do feel as though I can give this thumbs up as a purchase, especially since in this day and age there is little left to buy that is &quot;music&quot;.<br />I cannot believe there are so many 5 star reviews. I believe a 5 star is only worthy when a group is at their pinnacle, and sadly Iron Maiden peaked in '85/'86. Most of the cd's since have seen good songs surrounded by fluff, Blood Brothers indeed.
B00005JHAB|5.0|I saw this movie the day it came out several months ago, and have been back to see it several times since then.  It it such a cute, fun movie to watch.  Matthew McConaughey is absolutely gorgeous in this movie and Jennifer Lopez is very well cast next to him.  I loved this movie, and would absolutely reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a fun romantic comedy to watch.
0679720200|5.0|What a dazzling book. <br />A profound and heartfelt statement on the nature of man against a society who condemns him because he is different, because he cannot find it in him to lie or be false to his own moral code so he is punished for it and his punishment finds his freedom. The book is a haunting testament to our world nowadays and will be forever remembered because some essences of societies never change and the one in this book accurately shows that.<br />along with being a masterful tale, a perfect introduction into Camus's theories of man and existentialism which set the movement in motion with Sartre, the novel can be read by any lay person but only the inclined mind or in this case, the stranger who reads the book will understand the value of its extreme importance and the values it preaches and the absurdity of life.<br />Mersault is a young man who remains unaffected by events around him, even his own mother's death. why? Mersault is different, its not that he doesn't care or has no sense of emotion or feeling but its because he lives moment to moment instead of jumping back and forth between present and future....This is a must read for any serious reader or person interested in philosophy or the essence of man. this book is greatness pesonified in the magical pen of Camus.
B00003CXQX|3.0|The Emperor's New Grove was halerious for the grand kids ages 12, 11, 8, 7, 6, and 4. It was like standup comedy for them, nothing charming, just a lot of one liners. For the grand parents it was shallow, featureless and like a Saturday morning cartoon. <br />In my grand fatherly opinion the Emporer's character is too crass and selfcentered to be believeable, and the peasant (John Goodman's voice) was too patient in contrast to convince me of a good story. The funniest character, from my point of view, was the one with the voice of &quot;Puddy&quot; from the Sienfeld TV show.
B0000508U6|5.0|I was blown away by how good this album was. Every song is finely crafted and thought up. Every track features great chord changes and moving vocals. This record is very mellow and mysterious, perfect for reflection or plain relaxation. This is the greatest record I have heard since All That You Can't Leave Behind by U2. It is a must buy for anyone who appreciates good music, simply awesome.
0440180295|5.0|Throughout the seemingly incoherent plot structure of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut illustrates not only his subtle outcry against the stupidity of war, but also his cynical views on the meaning of life. Although the novel is based upon the life of Billy Pilgrim, an optometrist correcting the vision of people on Earth, and his experiences leading up to the bombing of Dresden, Germany during World War II, the time-setting fluctuates as Billy comes \\"unstuck\\" in time to view his past and future. This fluctuation may confuse the reader at first, but soon becomes clear, revealing the purpose behind the masterfully chosen timeline.     The apparent random structure of the tale holds within it Vonnegut's ideas on the circular nature of life and existence of fate. He first hints to this in the first chapter as he quotes a song that continues through infinite, just as a circle. As the story progresses, the Tralfamadorian aliens are introduced, providing the basis for the abnormal writing style. The Tralfamadorians write in such a way that all events of the book are read at once so that the scenes \\"produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep\\" (88).  Although his abduction by aliens is only a part of his imagination, forced into existence by the stresses of war and the influences of his favorite science fiction novelist, it plays a major roll in Billy's \\"so it goes\\" attitude toward life and causes him to act in such a way that people are eventually repelled by him. Just as the aliens introduce Billy to infinite, they also reveal the nature of fate. Because these creatures can see through time, they already know the outcome of all events, even the one that destroys the universe. Because they know that nothing can change this, they find that the human concept of free will is hilariously preposterous.     Vonnegut also includes his anti-war position throughout the whole mess.  In the autobiographical first chapter, he even states that this is an anti-war book. This is further supported by his alternate title, The Children's Crusade, referring to the episode during the great Crusades when thousands of children marched to their deaths. The parallel between Billy's capture in Germany and his capture by the aliens also reveals his attitude. Billy asks the aliens why he was chosen out of all the people on Earth. They only respond \\"Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything?\\" (76). When he is captured in Germany, a soldier is asked \\"Why me?\\" and he replies \\"Vy you? Vy anybody?\\" (91). This connection between the aliens and the war create a sense that war is stupid. His repeated use of  \\"human beings\\" in his description of the Nazi transport train forces the reader to realize that these are actual people in this terrible environment.      Vonnegut's beliefs in life and war can clearly be seen through the workings of Slaughterhouse-Five as he constantly changes the timeline. These beliefs are all very important to the meaning of the book, but none more than his idea that life is meaningless in a structured time.
B00003CXPD|4.0|Expertly made tear-jerker, brilliant performances all round. Gary Lewis as the father is underrated, Stephen Daldry should search the cutting room floor for what could have been cut out in the transformation of his character. The film would have been better without the Hollywood ending despite Adam Cooper's breathtaking leap.
B000051VQR|5.0|I love this Album. I think it's the greatest one they've had. Minority, Warning, and Blood, Sex, and Booze are great songs. The instrumental playing is great. The song writing is great. I still don't know how they out do themselves every time they make an album.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Like most of the people i've heard Lady Marmelade from Pink, Mya, Christina and Lil Kim i thought it was a great remake but i didn't think i would enjoy the rest of CD, but after so many recommendation i went to listen to it before buying it to make sure i really like it...well i spend over 30mins listening to the CD i was surprised i much i liked it. I love theatre so that cd was a real treat for me. Ewan McGregor is fabulous he has a fantastic voice so is  Nicole Kidman's voice they really pull it off their voices blend well together. The highlight on this CD for me is Your song, Come what may (soo beautiful ) Nicole is great in Sparkling Diamonds, Hindi sad Diamonds(very haunting)El Tango de Roxanne another great track and i can't forget the Elephant Meldley especially when they sing Heroes.. also worth to mention is Children of the Revolution and Diamonds Dogs i could go on and on .. all i can say is this CD is funky, original, haunting, beautiful and ecclectic, plus if you love musicals this is a must.
B000003Z4C|5.0|I discovered Nick Cave by listening to Murder Ballads- which is a great album but this album is even better. Cave takes the main theme of love and writes beautiful (Nobody's Baby Now) and scary (Loverman) songs. The lyrics are the work of a true poet - the first true Rock-Poet since Jim Morrison.  Only one song doesn't mention love and it is Red-Right Hand . It is a very good song, creepy and powerful, yet if you listen to it then to Song of Joy on Murder Ballads it becomes scary.  The music is varried ranging from Cohenlike ballad (Let love in) to frenzied rock (Thhirsty Dog, Jangling Jack) One of the greatest albums ever.
B000001EXR|4.0|A long time follower of the KISS Army, I must admit I enjoyed this CD. Hearing Paul Stanley sing Master and Slave was incredibale. Mostly he's known for singing the up beat tempo songs and the ballads, but to hear him crank out a dark, evil song was incredible. This is a departure from KISS almost to a point of a Danzig sound. Would have been nice to hear some of this live. Bruce kulick sings one song and does a great job. I had the pleasure of meeting him several years ago and some friends of mine asked if he would sing more. If the support we gave me helped, we feel great. I walk Alone was terrific Bruce. Hope to see more of you behind the mic. One thing missing from this album is the duets Paul and Gene used to do on songs lost since..well it's been a while until Psycho Circus.
0345440757|5.0|As a first time mother, I was very interested in hearing opinions on how to get my baby into a flexible routine. Not only does Tracy guide you through each step, she is also very thorough in explaining how to adapt the routine as your child's needs change. She proves that you can have time for yourself! This book should be on every new parents' list of reading materials, right next to &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting.&quot; It is very easy to read, and the layout of topics makes it a great reference material. I highly recommend this book to both new mothers and fathers.
6300214826|5.0|Apocalypse Now is a war movie that's not about war.  Well, war in a conventional sense anyway.  It is about the inner struggles that man faces in the presence of horror.  Francis Ford Coppola has taken Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness and conveyed his message through the words of Martin Sheen and the setting of Vietnam.  Apocalypse Now is a true triumph of film with unnerving, haunting performances from Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen.  The aura of the film is steeped in evil and darkness.  Coppola's direction is nothing short of breathtaking.  There are scenes of graphic violence where the camera does not flinch nor do the characters.  The most memorable character, besides Col. Kurtz, is Kilgore played by Robert Duvall to sheer perfection.  Kilgore is the leader of a renegade battalion who goes around &quot;the 'nam&quot; looking for &quot;the sh!t.&quot;  Some of the best lines ever written are pulled off to pure perfection.  &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning, smells like...victory.&quot;  This is classic stuff and a masterpiece of the cinema.  The mystique behind the making of this film makes it all the more intriquing, sort of like the movie was cursed.  But, anyway no one should go through life without once watching this life altering film.  Also check out Hearts of Darkness which depicts the making of Apocalypse Now and all of the problems associated with it.

B00005BL2A|1.0|I can't figure out what all these rave reviews are about. With the exception of the catchy first track,this album is trite,flat and exceedingly boring. I gave this album several repeat listenings over the course of a week to no avail. My disappointment increased with each repeat. Blah. I enjoyed the industrial sonic hum of Songs of Faith and Devotion and was expecting more of the same....not so with this. The 80's are over and out.
B000002UEB|5.0|Every generation or so a band may appear and make an album so far ahead of it's time musically and intellectually, that all bands of that era fall to the wasteside. Pink Floyd was that band until Queensryche released Mindcrime. This album is an assault on the senses as well as the mind...and you don't have to be stoned to get the message. Never has an album only an hour long contained so much. This album could easily be created into a thatrical movie by hollywood, but would not do it justice. The guitars of DeGarmo and the phenominal vocal range of Geoff Tate is a lethal combination. The music flows together like a symphony of metal. This is the album that all other musicians try to accomplish...but never do. This is the next step in the evolutionary ladder in concept albums.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I've never been disappointed with any of DM's work so calling this their best is saying a lot from me. David Gahan is back big time. His vocals make this album!!Freelove and When the Body Speaks are beautiful ballads with great synth stuff going on under the vocals. Dream On, Shine and Comatose are all solid Depeche Mode pieces with lots of layers of music and great arrangement. And really crank up your stereo for Dead of Night. Its like Pimpf turned into a full song with dark but kinda goofy, goth lyrics. The album is clearly an improvement over Ultra and on par with Violator and Music for the Masses. Every track is solid except I Feel Loved. Buy it now you won't be sorry!
0783107986|4.0|Beginning with Hitler's rise to power in 1933, the series gives the story of World War II from the British perspective.  Although interviews with former civil and military officials of Germany and Japan add some balance, the United States' role in winning the war is de-emphasized.  Viewers are constantly reminded that the United States &quot;suffered little&quot; but &quot;gained the most.&quot;  Never mind, I suppose, that 400,000 Americans died during the war.
0451527046|4.0|I really thought it was a good book, and beeing in the 8th grade i think the classes in the future should do a unit on it or maybe just Robert Louis Stevenson. I think this becasue he really has a writting style of his own and the story isn't as well known as it should be. So overall i really liked it and would deffinitly recomemd anyone to read this book.
B00004XONN|5.0|I usually judge a record I've bought by the number of times it leaves me breathless.  High-counters so far:  Daydream Nation, Sonic Youth; Pink Moon, Nick Drake; Closer, Joy Division; bla bla bla.<br />Here's a count for Kid A:<br />Everything in It's Right Place-- 1.  2:50.  Buildup, then spare, Kraftwerk-style organ-sounding synth.  Like some robot remembering something from a long time ago, over and over and over....<br />Kid A-- 2.  0:11.  Fragile toy-box chimes.  This strange mix between heartbreaking and innocent--one of the most gorgeous melodies I've ever heard. 3.  1:20.  Synth repose with strange organ chimes.  Almost sacred-sounding. 4.  3:05.  Jittery bass-drum line that seemed ominous before suddenly becomes otherworldly.  Jonny fades in with this unlikely, GORGEOUS synth chord--its tone is a mix between radio static and some 80s, Cure-like synth line.  Sometimes brings a tear to my eye.. 5.  3:20.  Chord is sustained, but now that toy-chime melody comes in!  Fragile, heartbreaking, numb, naive--like child abuse from the child's perspective.  ALWAYS brings a tear to my eye..<br />National Anthem-- 6.  Around 1:20.  Warbled orchestra melody plus some electronic noodling above the mix.  Feels like I'm in the ocean and a giant, unnamed current sweeps from underneath my feet to 16,000 feet below. 7.  1:57.  Another small blast of noise.  Somehow mixing melody and organic electronics.  Suggestive but emotionless.  Reminds me (heaven knows why) of Merzbow. 8.  2:40.  Sax comes in.  Why is it that my head always spazzes uncontrollably at this moment?  Ahh.. rock on boys. 9.  The rest of the song.  Sustained brass orgasm.  Funny thing is, you can't really rock out to it cuz it doesn't have enough anger.  You can't &quot;appreciate&quot; it because it isn't artsy enough for your high tastes.  All you can do is let it be, listen to it how a three-year-old might, before corruption with mass media, before &quot;rebellion,&quot; before thinking you're some sort of smart-butt hipster.  So emotionally complicated--it modulates in a matter of seconds.  Try it out.<br />Oh goodness, I've gotten carpal tunnel before even getting to my favorite tracks (How to Disappear Completely, Treefingers, Optimistic, Morning Bell).  And, just for the record, Treefingers is an amazing exploration into ambient/space-drone unlike anything you've ever heard.  I'm tempted to mention Brian Eno and Spacemen 3, but this track is better than all of them combined, take my word for it.  Ignore all those who tell you to skip this track.<br />I'm now finished.  Thanks for your cooperation, and your money.
B000000ORE|5.0|Tesla's greatest album. This rock/blues/jazz based album went against the hair bands of Motley Crue, Poison, and the Warrant's and were passed off as a fluke after Mechanical Resonance(Great Album also). But not getting glammed up and playing typical  sounds, and staying gritty Tesla showed that rock was going astray and they were here to set it straight again. This album did not head into the grunge area either, This is just a straight out rock album true to the heart, with out all that hairspray!
B00005BL2A|3.0|It was Ultra that got into DM - what I liked about it was its darkness and slightly more industrial feel. Exciter has a cleanliness reminiscent of Violator, but is more up-beat. I have to say, though, that none of the songs on Exciter strikes me as being as well-constructed as those on Violator.
0399229191|5.0|We just purchased this book a few days ago, and my 17 month old daughter already loves it!!<br />She loves hearing all of the different sounds and the pictures really seem to hold her attention. Also, the text on each page is not too long, as she can't seem to handle books that are too long at her age.<br />I love the ending, it is very cute and sweet!
B000000OSG|5.0|Having been a fan of GNR since I first heard songs like &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; when I was about 10, ( I am 18 now), I have become a much deeper fan after listening to albums such as this one. On my long car trips to Cape Cod, this album is great(except for &quot;My World&quot;). &quot;Estranged&quot; has easily become one of my favorite songs, if not my favorite song ever. My best friend once cried on her long trip to school while hearing this song( and at that point, she had listened to it over 100 times). There is so much raw energy in this band which is both displayed here and yet also converted into a warmth of love for lyrics and emotion. Anyone who consider GNR as merely a flukey 80s band needs to hear this album. Slash is unbelievable and Axl's voice was never better. Ever remember the music video for &quot;Estranged&quot; with the dolphins? Every time I hear that guitar solo in the song I think of the dolphins...This is raw rock n' roll at its best for it can convey anger, love, lust, hope, fury and beauty into pure emotion which flows out of every cord.
B000001FS3|5.0|I've been listening to this album for probably 8 years now, and really it was the album that introduced me to U2... I remember I heard With or Without You on tv, and well I found a tape that my brother had, and I have been hooked ever since... just to point out, I'm 18, so when this album first came out, and was being played on the radio and stuff, I was only 5 years old, so I wasn't really listening to radio music at all... that's why I didn't really start listening to the album till around 92 or 93... I've always loved this album, but it seems that recently I've found new, and greater love for it... first when you listen to it, you enjoy the catchy melodies, and cool guitar work and stuff, but there is a deeper sound, and a deeper meaning to each song... firstly, my new found love of this cd has a lot to do with the lyrical content of the songs... while I've had interpretations of each song for quite some time, I just recently began to see the correlation with my own life... the songs talk about being lost, and trying to find answers I guess, but more specifically talk about struggles with Christianity... songs like I Still Haven't Found what I'm Looking For, and With or Without You (yes, I choose to interpret this as being about God, rather then another person, cause well, it makes more sense to me) talk about the struggle with living a the Christian life, and living the &quot;worldly&quot; life... and well, I can relate cause I've struggled with that myself... you can really hear the desperation in Bonos voice when he sings... Where the Streets have no Name can be interpreted as a song about being lost (although I have read other interpretations) which can also relate to Christianity... so yeah, the themes about Christianity really speak to me I guess, because I've gone through the same things, in a different way obviously, cause I'm not a rock star, but it's still the same... <br />secondly, my new appreciation for the album is with the music... I've always like the melodies, and thought they were incredibily catchy, but the music is so dense... I recently watched a show called Classic Albums on The Joshua Tree album, and it really shows the density of the sound... I truely appreciate the genious of Where the Streets have No Name, and With or Without You, and Bullet the Blue Sky... on the show that I watched, The Edge played the guitar part for Where the Streets have no Name, and well, it's just beautiful... but another thing that I appreciate is Brian Enos contribution to the album... when I first listened to the album I had no idea Brian Eno was an experimental artist, dabbling in ambient techno, but now I know, and I can really appreciate the opening of Where the Streets have no Name, and With or Without You to name a few... plus, now I know how they generated that weird sound in The Mothers of the Dissappeared... it's actually Larry's drumming put through a certain machine... anyways, I just love this album... I've been listening to it for 8 or 9 years, and I'm still not sick of it... I played it straight through last night and I just love every song... if you haven't bought it yet, what are you waiting for? Go and get it... I've always said that Achtung Baby was there best album, but now I'm beginning to think The Joshua Tree is... it's just beautiful...
B000000OMP|4.0|As Whitesnake albums go this one is OK, with several strong songs. Always being critized as being Led Zeppelin knock-offs, I'm here to say...Led Zepplin was overated! So shut up! As Whitesnake goes their musicianship is better but their albums Whitesnake and Slip of the Tongue were far better. Trust me Steve Vai on Slip of the Tongue would bury Jimmy Page.
B000002L6P|5.0|I'm going to get nostalgic at the beginning of this review, because this album holds special memories for me.  This album was my first listen to Madonna, and I have been hooked ever since.  I was introduced to Madonna via my cousin, all we would do was listen to this tape(remember it was 1984, CD's were in their infancy faze), and she would listen to it constantly, and I would always be right there listening to it, and there is just one thing to say, this CD is timeless, I mean the songs go so well together that's it's easy to see why this album was so huge.  The hits from this album aren't the only reason, but the unreleased material is just as good.  &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, &quot;Material Girl&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot; were all released from this album, and all 4 landed in the top 5, but &quot;Over And Over&quot;, &quot;Pretender&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot;, &quot;Shoo-Be-Doo&quot; and &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot;(which was actually released in 1996 off of &quot;Something To Remember&quot;), were all releasable songs.  From the moment I listened to this album I knew that I would like Madonna, and I haven't turned my back on her since then, and why would I?  I cannot wait until the remastered version of &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; is released, because I already have the original now I will have the original and remastered versions.  Back in 1984 my cousin and myself listened to the album so much that we wore it out, I have it on CD now(finally), and I am glad I bought it.  Just think 17 years ago this album was out and 17 years later, it still holds alot of fond memories for me.  Madonna has that effect on people, and that's nice.  Grade A album.
0312979479|5.0|This was SUCH a good book! It was the first Agatha Christie book I read, and I was hooked! The plot is so clever, and ingenious. I've read this book three times now, and every time I catch some little clue as to who dun it, and I kick myself for not getting it! If you love mysteries, and even if you don't, this is a great book you HAVE to read!
B00004Z459|5.0|People either love it or hate it. The one's who do love it, say its sounds like a mixture of korn/limp bizkit/godsmack. Personally, when I heard runaway on the radio and a friend a day before suggested it the album, I thought what the hell and bought it. Much to my surprise, there are only so few albums that I can listen to without skipping to the next track, and this is one of them in my own opinion. I love it!  First time I heard the whole album though, it reminded me of Korn (follow the leader), NIN (pretty hate machine-believe it or not), and 311 (transistor). Some of you might think I'm on crack from thinking this...anyhow, it's not bad at all. Try it out if you like some of those bands.
B000001FTD|5.0|From classic speed metal this album everything that IS metal. From classics like I am The Law and Among the Living, Anthrax shows why they are veterans of the rock world and how these new 'poser' bands just cannot compare musically or lyrically. Their usage of speed and heavy riffs, combined with brilliant vocals makes me wonder what happened to society. How have we come to let poser bands rule when bands like Anthrax still exist with such complexity to their music. One will never know. Britney and the Backstreet Boys probably have deals with Satan and this is my new found hell. Metal! Come back we miss you!!
B000002N3J|5.0|What a great way to package your ballads on one album, once again Madonna knew what she was doing when she put these ballads on one album, some of these songs, were not even on a Madonna album when they were first released.  For example, &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;, was on an Olympic album in 1992 called &quot;Barcelona Gold&quot;, then &quot;I'll Remember&quot; was orginally on the &quot;With Honors&quot; soundtrack in 1994.  And there are songs brand new on this CD, &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, and one of my favorites &quot;You'll See&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Take A Bow&quot; which is also on this CD, right before &quot;You'll See&quot;.  And finally there are songs from previously released albums, like &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Oh Father&quot;, and a very different sounding &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot;, which I happen to feel sounds better on this album.  This is a great album to own because not only do you get classic Madonna you also get unreleased Madonna which is always a plus, once again Madonna didn't disappoint on this album.  Another A+ album from Madonna.
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL's newest work had letdown written all over it. Few bands would be able to live up to the expectations of the world follwing a showing like Aenema. After the first few full listens through, the TOOL sound of before comes through very few times, with only scattered heavy guitar riffs, and the usual rythymic tempos. But its when you least expect it that you start to notice the real intricacies of the music, the true evolution the band is making.Its not different than TOOL, only different from the last album, as it was different than the one before. Amazing.
B00005B36H|5.0|Prior to the release of &quot;Lateralus&quot;, the best Tool CD was, in my opinion, &quot;Aenima&quot; (which I think a lot of people will agree with).  &quot;Aenima&quot; showed a lot of growth musically and creatively from &quot;Undertow&quot;, and while &quot;Aenima&quot; was a very good CD, it really seemed to lack continuity.  Also, once past the 1st 3 song, the CD seemed to loss some momentum (with the exception of a few later songs on the CD).<br />With &quot;Lateralus&quot;, Tool's songwriting, while great before, has gotten even better.  Both lyrically and musically, the songs are very diverse.  The album as a whole is very complex, to which most reviewers on this page have alluded.  The music itself is heavier overall than previous efforts by Tool, which, for me, is a big bonus.  The drumming and, especially, the guitar work are more agressive on this album than on either &quot;Aenima&quot; or &quot;Undertow&quot; (by far). I can understand how the song lengths and intermittent long-short-long song arrangements might bother some people, and while this is not an entirely new concept, I think that it works here.  The transition between songs is very smooth, and it almost seems like you're listening to one long song or a concept album.<br />While I'm sure that, after reading this review, some people will disagree with me, I believe that this really is Tool's best CD to date.  I personally feel that it was worth the wait.
B00000JG4N|3.0|This is one of Motley's greatest albums. Listen to these rocking songs, Dr.Feelgood, Kickstart My Heart, S.O.S., She Goes Down and Rattlesnake shake. All foot stompin, fist raised rockin songs. BUT! The Ballads.... I'm sorry but I find them lame. Hey I know people say rock ballads are lame, but I love a good rock ballad. Motley just sounds like, \\"well we need a ballad...that'll work\\" I find them to be what holds this album back from being their best work.
0671027344|5.0|The main reason i love this book is simple. i was going through a rough time in my life last year. i was a freshman in highschool and was looking at the prospect of losing a lot of my friends who were moving to various places through the continantal US, and a very very close friend of mine had just moved. it really felt like the end. the first contact i had with her or her family was to find out that she had tried to kill herself. a new friend in my art class gave me this, saying how wonderful a book it was and how he thought it would help me out. I read it and instantly identified with the main charactor &quot;Charlie&quot;. he is a quiet and fairly innocent boy who was also a fershman in highschool and going through different but paralell problems to mine. it helped me put my problems in perspective and over all was very helpfull to me in figuring out how to deal with life.  that prety much is why it is my favorite book to this day (almost a year and a half later)
B0000070QS|5.0|I've been a fan of a-ha from day one and with no exceptions, Morten has the best voice I've ever heard...Period.  I also have Poetenes  Evangelium, which is in Norwegian, and it is incredible.  I have Vogts Villa on order, and biting my nails until it arrives!  Can't wait for the next a-ha CD to be released.
B00005B36H|5.0|People are gonna say,&quot;That's not like the old Tool!&quot; No it isn't, but it's still as musically great as any other Tool release. Best for die-hard Tool fans, and best for new-comers to the Tool scene. Fans of Staind and the like will be pleased with this release. I got this album as soon as i could. The packaging is very strange, no lyrics or liner notes, just pictures of the human anatomy on that clear plastic sheet stuff. I said it once and I'll say it again, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!
B000001FKY|5.0|If I remember right Hysteria is the greatest selling pop/metal album of all time. Their is a reason. This album was so monumental to 80's rock that it did itself in. Everyone tried to become the best band out of the 80's. From rock anthems like Pour Some Sugar on Me, and Ballads like Love Bites and Hysteria this Album produced 7 singles...7 singles? Yes 7 singles. That's how good this album is. Hysteria, Rocket, Women, Love Bites, Sugar, Armageddon, and Animal. An artist now adays has a hard time finding three singles on an album. Some put that album down because of the elcetronic drums from the Thunder God Rick Allen, but in all honesty that add to the thickness and depth to their sound. Hysteria is the album that not only defined Def Leppard but the rock genre of the 80's.
B000056K04|4.0|It is ridiculous to read people saying &quot;Everyday&quot; is terrible, worthless, or that they will stop being fans. The same people criticizing them for going mainstream or to pop have listened to the album maybe once and found nothing catchy enough (such as a pop song), then berating it for being horrble and the worst album. Yes, it is a new, different sound from the band. They are real musicians, not like the top 40's/Billboard groups, thus they can do whatever they like with their sound. When I first got BTCS, it sounded entirely different than the first 2 full albums. I listened to it a couple times, then shelved it for a month, but after familiarizing myself with the songs later on, I really loved the album. During the Summer 2000 tour, DMB played a few of the songs that eventually became the Lillywhite Sessions, I didn't think that highly of them at first either, but now people consider that the DMB sound and not &quot;Everyday&quot;. Everyday didn't meet my expectations initially, because I expected something different, what we got was something that is still good music from a great band.
B00004Y2QS|5.0|This concert video of Prince and a multitude of other performers is a must have for any Prince fan.  The jams just keep coming with one special guest after another.  The amount of talent is staggering.  Even those folks that aren't in to Prince as much as his fans can't help but appreciate the wonderful sounds being made by musicians who love making music and who love to perform.  There's slow jams and jazz and funk and fast grooves to keep you on your toes.  Hook up the television to your stereo, turn up the volume, and jam along with Prince.
0140186409|4.0|The novel The Grapes of Wrath written by John Steinbeck is a master peace of literature. Through the travels of the Joad family you get an incredible feeling of what it felt like to travel during the Dust Bowl of the late 1930's. The novel starts with a recently paroled Tom Joad hitchhiking to his family's farm in Oklahoma. After being let off, Tom starts walking towards where his farm was before he was put in prison for homicide. Soon after he begins walking he meets up with another main character, Jim Casy who is a former preacher. After shooting the breeze for a while the both of them continue the journey to the Joad farm. Upon arriving at the farm, they find it deserted. Tom, clueless as to what happened does not know what to do. After looking around the property for a while, Tom notices his neighbor Muley Graves, coming towards him and the preacher. Tom asks him if he knows where the Joad family is. Muley states because they cannot afford to stay on their land they were forced to relocate to Uncle John's farm. After spending the night at the Joads house, the preacher and Tom Joad continue on their journey to Uncle John's. When they arrive at Uncle John's two things happen to Tom. First of all his own mother does not recognize him, second of all, after everyone does figure who he is, they all asked him when he escaped. To which he replied, \\"I was paroled\\". Soon the family realizes they cannot celebrate Tom's freedom. They quickly load their 27' Dodge pick- up with all the belongings they will need, and soon they are on their way to California. The character that forms his identity throughout the book is the main character Tom Joad. He does what is best for the group by going with his family to California. He easily could have stayed in Oklahoma where it would be safe for him. But instead he breaks his parole in order to go California with his loved ones. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who likes thinking while they read. A book such as this one deserves the utmost attention while reading it.eserves the utmost attention while reading it.
B00005221L|5.0|It's very difficult for the large number of people involved in a film to make one that's perfect, but Predator is one such example.  Outstanding story, action, setttings, and characters.  It opens a whole new class of story.  It's not man-vs-himself, man-vs-man, but man-vs-alien.<br /> A US Special Forces team is tasked with a mission deep in an unnamed tropical country.  Little do they know that their breed - professional warriors - is the desired prey for a trophy-hunting alien who remorselessly uses the finest galactic sporting technology to hunt down the hapless humans.  Alone and armed only with their courage, the humans are forced to confront the ultimate killing machine.<br /> This movie is 15 years old and is still my favorite action film.  A must-see for action fans!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The only problem with this CD is that it doesn't capture all the music from the Movie. Hopefully there'll be a second disc. This one those is fantastic, esepcially the &quot;Elephant Love Medely&quot; between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman along with Nicole's &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; number. The soundtrack is as awesome and amazing as the film.
B00005A0N5|5.0|It only takes one word to describe this album....PERFECTION!!
B00000J7JO|5.0|Disregard the singles, because any song on this album could have been one.  Focus on the whole album, it is one of the most melodic, yet hard-rocking CDs ever.  Crazy as it seems, but true, this album ranks up there with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or other classics.  The soft songs are very soulful, with John, Anothony, Chad, and Flea pouring their hearts into them, and the harder songs will make your spine tingle from the funk.  If you are a fan of rock and are thinking about getting this album, do NOT listen to it first.  Let it suprise you.  I got it the day it came out, having never listened to the Peppers.  That was one of the greatest days I've ever had in my life.  Best songs: This Velvet Glove and Porcelain
B00005B36H|5.0|First off, this album is amazing.  I started liking TOOL when I heard all of Aenima, which also happens to be a great CD.  I bought both Opiate and Undertow soon after, and I quickly recognized a pattern of evolution and growing maturity in their music from album to album, and everytime a new one comes out, alot of the fans of the previous album don't embrace the new one.  Those who liked Opiate called them sell outs for making the more alternative sounding Undertow, and then when Aenima came, they supposedly &quot;lost their touch.&quot;  Now, here after an admittedly long wait, is another wonderful TOOL album, and yet again, people will say that it is &quot;missing something.&quot;  And of course this is a judgement made after swiping the tracks off of some file sharing program.  Well, for those of you who downloaded it before it came out, listen to Ticks and Leeches, and Maynard will tell you exactly what he thinks of you.  To sum it up, this CD is on another artistic plane from any of the other music you might hear on the radio.  BUY THE CD and absorb it as a whole.  It will hold you, prying open your third eye...

B00003CXE7|5.0|I'm going to keep this somewhat short, and sweet.  Gladiator is absolutley brilliant.  Ridley Scott directs this Roman epic, and he enlists the talents of Russell Crowe as the lead character, Maximus, a General in the Roman Army.  Alongside Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix is the Emperor, after his father passes on.  This film grips the viewer and holds them intensely right from the beginning, with a battle scene so fierce it will draw comparisons to the scenes from Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  Right from there the viewer expects sheer brilliance for the rest of the film, and that is exactly what they get.  Crowe's performance in Gladiator is the best performance given by an actor since, once again, Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace in his classic, Braveheart. Crowe's dialogues are just perfect for delivery, tone, volume, everything.  Body actions match precisely to his words, and much is the same for the rest of the characters.  Phoenix, the Emperor, makes you believe that he really is a mean S.O.B, with a real evil look to boot.  Although I'd have to say the best performance given by any actor ever would be Al Pacino as the Great Tony Montana in Scarface.  Now, Scarface is my favorite movie of all time, and after that movie, few have been able to list as classics on my all-time list.  In order (1-5) my favorite movies of all time are: 1.  Scarface, (Al Pacino)  2.  Braveheart,(Mel Gibson) 3.  Gladiator,(Russell Crowe) 4.  Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, 5.  Juice, (Tupac Shakur). To put Gladiator into this position, in my opinion, is a testament to the movie, its makers, and its actors.  So in all, this is the best movie in years, and well worth buying as a permanent fixture in your collections.  Oh, and see if you can spot WWF's The Rock as one of the Gladiators.  Enjoy!
B000056VIY|5.0|i got this c.d 2 days ago from a friend, and i thought, maybe this album is worth something, because in each c.d there's atlist 4-3 outstanding tracks. and while i was listening, i was amazed! i haven't yet had a chance tho hear the entire album, but i did heard 10 tracks of it and there are really good!!<br />love don't cost a thing is a very nice track but i had enough of it... (: though it is nice!<br />i'm real is just so beautiful!!!! i love this song very much!!!!<br />play is very cool and funky, and i finally had the chance to hear the &quot;mother f*****&quot; thing, and i was really amused! <br />walking on sunshune is nice, though not the best.<br />ain't it funny.... i have no words except AMAZING!!!!! what a fine track!!!!!!! i think (think!) it'smy favourite for now...<br />carino is latin like, and it's also a very nice track.<br />come over.. well, actually i didn't find this one so beautiful, it's o.k i guess but nothing un-usuall.<br />dance with me is, well, that's weird, every time i hear this song i have this feeling aboutsomething very strong about this song... i don't know, maybe it's just me...<br />and....wait, then i just heard 8 songs, not 10... (: anyway, the album is really good, and i believe it will grow on me much soon!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I've seen some bad reviews for Lateralus in here, and I really don't understand why.  For some people it just amounts to laziness, I guess.  For others, they either don't have the capicity to understand this album, or their subconscience is afraid to let them understand it.<br />Tool has always been about inspiration through music, and I don't know when it became &quot;hip&quot; to listen to Tool, but it seems as though everyone's looking for that radio-friendly song that just jumps out at you the first time you listen to the album.  Frankly, it's not on this album.<br />What you will find on this album are outstanding rhythms that almost bring out a tribal side of Danny Carey which must have Sepultura chomping at the bit.  You'll find that psycadelic-meets-crunch journey of the soul from Adam Jones' and Justin Chancellor's guitars, and at the forefront of it all, you'll find that familiar voice of Maynard James Keenan punching you in the face with a dose of reality long overdue.<br />Any &quot;Tool fan&quot; who thinks poorly of this album needs to go back and listen to &quot;Hooker With a Penis.&quot;  I am as OGT as they get, and I can tell you straight up that this is by far their greatest release to date.  Don't bring them into your world; instead sit back and close your eyes...and slip into their world.<br />Genius...you'll agree this album is pure genius!
0618135871|5.0|Here Roth examines the issues connecting sex and death with same vigor that he applied to his most recent trilogy. This short book lacks the scope and the balance of American Pastoral, but instead aims with a laser-like intensity upon its themes.<br />I disagree with some of the other reviewers who argue that the narrator is a stand-in for the author, thought I can understand how you can be swayed by the passion in Kepesh's voice.   Here Roth continues to perfect his technique of having the narrator persuasively argue a point, only to have another character give an equally strong opposing argument several pages later.  As in the best of Roth's earlier work, he builds and subverts the hero's philosophy with equal force, leaving the reader to ponder the `truth' or absence thereof. <br />The first-person narrator in this book lets Roth get away with a lot of what could be construed as sloppiness here.  Some thinly developed characters, frustrating holes in the timeline, and occasional inability to follow ideas through can all be chalked up to the fallibility of the narrator (if you are feeling generous).<br />Yes, Roth continues to experiment with form and structure. Yes, he continues to dare us to hate his protagonist.  And yes, he brings us almost grotesque scenes of sexuality.  This book is flawed, and occasionally annoying.  Yet, as you can see from my 5 star rating, I feel that the humor, anger, insight and courage contained in its 156 pages are unique and make this book essential, in a way.  Besides, it contains what may be the definitive description of New Years Eve 1999.
B00005B36H|5.0|Of course it is not like nima, but that doesn't make it a bad album. Throughout the band's history, they have evolved and changed the sound and spirit of their music. If you trace Opiate through to Lateralus, each successive musical installment is a bit different than the one before. That is the REASON to enjoy Lateralus; it's NOT the same as nima. It is structurally and internally unique, with the fluid imagery and intuitive lyrics that have become Tool's trademark. I can't tell you how many times I have bought an album only to find out it sounds just like the last one. I am sure Tool intentionally avoided that pitfall. With the skill this quartet has, they could have copied the sound from nima with ease. Methinks the underlying point is that they wanted to take this album in a new direction (the lyrics for the title track should tell you that much), which they succeeded in doing. Great job, fellas.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Let's face it, without \\"Lady Marmalade\\" this album would not be worth buying. In fact, who in their right mind would pay money to hear Nicole Kidman sing? Okay, that's a little mean, I admit, but I'm just not a fan of this. So why would I give an album with one good song five stars? The good one is that good. Mya, Pink, Lil' Kim and Christina (My voice brings down the house)Aguilera. I have to admit, Christina got a little carried away in this one, but with that voice, who cares? I think the song would have been really dull, however, without the edgy selection of singers- Lil' Kim's rap is so cool. Without it, the song wouldn't really be different from the original, would it? Mya's sweet, innocent voice draws you in, Pink gets you in the groove and all four end up turning you into Christina- trying vocals way out of your range, perhaps, but enjoying yourself right  through the last high note. The song is TIGHT! (If you don't like it, perhaps you'll like the [stuff] on here, or perhaps you'll hate it all. In the words of Pink \\"Do What U Do\\")
B00000IAU3|5.0|What a voice - what a range....I loved every last song of this album!  Most gave me chills they were so good. If you like Sade or Sarah Mclaughlin this is an album for you.
B00004Y635|4.0|Okay, so this doesn't have the raw energy and expert satire of the original \\"Scream,\\" or even \\"Scream 2\\", but nonetheless, it is an enjoyable finale in this incredibly well-done series.  Since everyone knows the plot (read the other 300 reviews, wow!), I'd like to focus on what made this so enjoyable.  First, the leads (Campbell, Arquette, and Cox-Arquette) managed to have fun even though they had to play the same characters getting chased and abused by the different killers.  And the supporting cast is great:  Scott Foley as the plagued director; Parker Posey is superb as Gail's film character (she actually steals the movie!); Patrick Warburton as the macho guard is just fine; Carrie Fisher's cameo as the video archivist is priceless.  Lance Henriksen falls short only because he looks totally bored, which is unusual since he is such a good presence in so many other films.<br />The chills are present, and the tension builds nicely.  One big plothole:  how does the killer get Sidney's private home phone number---does anyone remember seeing the killer use Dewey's phone?  I don't recall?<br />Anyway, I'll miss these characters.  But I do think it's time to stop the screams for a while.  But enjoy this last foray into mayhem!!
0440133688|5.0|Transcends mere medicine, describing how to survive in a corporate culture where the objects of one's work are designed to make one commit suicide.  How to achieve by doing nothing. How to recognize and deal with ignorant and fanatic managers.  How to recognize and learn from the rare wise mentors. <br />The book's 70's sexism falls a little flat these days, but deep down therapeutic laughter is still abundant in this book!
0671027344|5.0|This is possibly the most endearing book that I have ever read. If you are a fan of the television show &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot; you will doubly appreciate &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;.  Written in the form of multiple letters, this is the story of a kind, somewhat socially inept boy who feels deeply and loves people so vividly it hurts. I wanted to literally reach into the story and give this wonderful character a hug, and a therapist! I have recommended this book to males and females and the response is always the same (loosely)--&quot;I cried and couldn't tell it it was from happiness or sadness&quot;. If you can remeber what it was like to be a teenager, this is a must read.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I recall seeing this in the theater without even knowing what it was about. As my title implies, I was very much impressed. Heat has stellar preformances from across the board and a storyline with more depth than most films in recent times. In a way, Heat is almost Shakespearian in structure thanks to a wonderful screenplay from director Michael Mann. Definitely a terrific piece of modern filmmaking.
630575067X|5.0|What do I have to say?  Star Wars is back.  I don't understand what all the bashing is for.  This is a perfect installment to the Star Wars Saga.  Those of you who hate this movie are either not true Star Wars fans or have no vision.  A lot of you have said this movie is boring and that it's only gonna get worse.  If you remember though A New Hope was kind of boring and didn't have the action or intensity of the other films.  Lucas is Building up to a bigger and better story.  The Phantom Menace is Just the building blocks to acheive that story...it's the first installment.  As for the actors...Ewan McGreagor is an excellent Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He amaziningly reseambles Alec Guiness from a new hope.  Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ray Park, and Ian Mcdiarmid were also amazing.  I can't wait for Episode II!
B000002HPV|5.0|I have to admit, though a fan Bjork, I found this CD a bit grating on first listen, but it has grown more and more appealing to me since.  What is most convincing about the work is the way in which the songs form a discernible narrative sequence, climaxing in some ways in the sequence of \\"Five Days,\\" \\"Immature\\" and \\"Alarm Call,\\" all of which have beautiful, hard-hitting lyrics.  A sample:  Five Days: \\"I am so tired of cowards who say what they want and then can't handle it.\\"  Alarm Call: \\"I am no Buddhist, but this is Englightenment\\"  or \\"I want to go to a mountain top with a radio and good batteries.  And play a joyous tune, and ease the human race of suffering.\\"  After the (to some limited minds) unbearable banshee howlings of \\"Pluto,\\" \\"All is Full of Love\\" shows that Bjork has exorcised the toxicity  by the recording's end.  This is a great CD to get over a break-up with.  Or to workout to.
6302994063|5.0|I skimmed through several reviews and kept seeing comparisons to Dirty Dancing. This movie can't even be compared to that!!! First of all, the dancing in SB moves the plot along, while in DD, it could be edited out and no one would know it was ever there. Secondly, this movie is the MASTERPIECE that DD is not and will never, ever be. Every thing about this movie is perfect--I especially love the chemistry between Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice. They really make Scott and Fran credible and believable characters.   Being that this is a small movie, it really works--and that is probably why it is better than anything Hollywood has produced in some time. And charming extras to the movie-- Tara Morice sings the TIME AFTER TIME song that runs throughout some of the movie. Paul Mercurio did his own dancing--including adding additional choreography. (He was a former ballet dancer before making this movie as his acting debut.) There are many others, but I'll leave you to discover them.
B000002KNU|5.0|&quot;Psycho Killer&quot; came on the car radio the other day, and I turned up the volume hoping that my kids might be able to hear it above the 'crap' they were listening to on their Walkmans.  &quot;NOW THIS IS REAL MUSIC KIDS&quot; I yelled in vain.  However, I soon began wondering why I would encourage my kids to listen to &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; post-Columbine anyway?  What was I thinking?  Perhaps I just wanted my kids to live in a world where quirky teenage angst was endearing and understood symbolically instead of being sanitized for fear of being taken so literally.   More than any late 70's album, Talking Heads '77 takes me back to a time of teenage rebellion that still had a sweet sensitive heart at its core.
B000056K04|5.0|I just sat down this evening to listen to this album for the FIRST time(basically by accident, really)......it is rare that I listen to a complete album for the first time and feel a connection with it.....but, I did with this one.  I have always respected and enjoyed Dave Matthews...I have tried to obtain tickets to see then in concert....but, they sell out soooooo fast. The lyrics are incredible!!!!  Just a GREAT culmination of music...that is all I have to say..........personal opinion is something that &quot;one&quot; owns.......................
1572700955|3.0|Having read Prode &amp; Prejudice, I can't but feel that Mansfield Park was not quite upto her usual standards. The book was dragging a bit in the middle &amp; I feel, the ending was a little hurried up. I rather thought Edmund would realise his mistake (about Miss Crawford) earlier &amp; would propose to Fanny. The plot of the story was good &amp; I liked the beginning too. Quite like a Cinderella tale. But I feel that she could've described the part where Edmund falls in love with Fanny in a more elaborate fashion. But all the same, a good book, but NOT for people who have read P &amp; P, &amp; think that this book is the same.
0590447254|5.0|My eleven-month-old daughter loves the melodic verse of this book. And so does her father, who has it stuck in his head like a song after we read it. I love the illustration style, as the earthy colors are very pleasing to the eye. This is a family favorite.
B00005B36H|5.0|Whether or not Tool is &quot;metal&quot; or, good lord, even &quot;rock&quot; music is of absolutely no consequence at all.  I believe the best music transcends genres and speaks to deeper fears, loves, pains, triumphs, and movements within us all.  I don't see how anyone could've written a competent review of this album after owning it for less than one day (which dozens of people did).  Many people dub Aenema with the term &quot;magnum opus&quot; but I felt it was too distracted/distracting to be such...THIS is a work reaching to another plateau all together.  The complexity of the rhythms and the haunting, almost subliminal undercurrents of various sounds throughout could take weeks or months to properly soak in.  The song structures themselves create strong patterns that weave through deep recesses in your brain, but each of which serves a more important purpose in developing an atmosphere in the album as a whole (necessary with any classic album, The White album, LZIV, Darkside, Weezer's blue album, etc.).  This is music, not as something to pop a cold one to and cruise down the street, but to immerse yourself in a tub of jello, a visceral experience more than worthwhile for anyone with the attention span and spiritual relationship with music necessary to appreciate it.
B000002UAX|5.0|No doubt, this album is the best of the band. Man, it rocks! I cannot name the best tracks on it, cause it's all great together! This album is for those, who didn't like Help or A Hard Day's Night too much. This album has more complex, more professional sound from one of the greatest rock&amp;roll bands ever! If U R looking 4 other master-pieces of The Beatles and liked this album, get Abbey Road and Let it Be!
B000059HAI|4.0|I have not seen the new Pearl Harbor film yet.  I am sure it is good and I am sure the attack parts are awesome.  But let us not forget the great Tora Tora Tora.  Historically accurate and showing us both sides Tora Tora Tora is an awesome look at what happened when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.<br />The new DVD is awesome.  The film looks great and the extra documentary is very good too.  The commentary is great also.  Especially the parts focusing on why Akira Kurosarwa was fired from the film.<br />Again, its not 2001 age special effects, but a great movie about an important moment in history.  I have always loved this film and am glad to have it on DVD, especially this special edition.<br />This is a must own-DVD!
B000002JS8|5.0|Aspiring guitarists take note.  Buy this CD.  Tune your guitar to this CD.  Play with it for 6 months.  Learn each song note for note.  You will then be ready to play in a band.  This is all you need.  Trust me.  Same for singers, bass players, and drummers.  This is the best possible rock music to learn, sing and play.  Long live rock!
B0000214G6|4.0|Passion they say. Obsession they say too. Neither. Possession for the man who wants to possess. Possessed-ness for the woman who wants to be possessed, mesmerized. The man treats the woman first as a child, then as a territory, then as a playmate, then as toy, then as a pet. And she starts resisting. So he treats her as a circus wild animal that has to be tamed. She refuses the game. Then he treats her as a voyeur, or voyeuse. Ans she walks out. Then she probably becomes a plant. And that's when she can't stand it any more. And she finally leaves. She is never loved for what she is, but for what he wants her to be and she accepts to be. It is not a love story, and from the very start. It is a magic trick. You must believe and play your part. It is roleplaying and nothing else. He probably loves her but he loves her submission, her domination, her acceptation to be directed as if she were and actress without a soul. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I have just read some of the negative reviews about the new CD from DM, and I have to say that I am appalled!!  The latest set of songs from The Best Band In The World right now is there best since Violator, and is close to as good as it!!  I would say that the sound they are trying to represent here is all of there 3 studio CD's from the 90's Violator,F&amp;D,and Ultra rolled into one.  The result is a wonderfully sounding ride for your ears!  I guess that if you are Depeche Mode there are some fans or so called fans who don't want you to change at all!!!!!  The songs on this CD's are so different from anything out there and it is by far the best CD that I have purchased this Century!!!  Go buy NOW!!!

6301016289|4.0|Real-life bigtime investment banker Jeff Beck not only advised Oliver Stone when he made 'Wallstreet' but also stars in this film for a few minutes playing himself at a climactic meeting of topdog-lawyers and bankers. He delivers one of the many exhilirating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocense lost. &quot;Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!&quot; He shouts at Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who plays a struggling young stockbroker who's desperately trying to get on the fast-track to becoming a &quot;player&quot;.<br />Michael Douglas who plays 'Gordon Gekko' (not 'Gecko' as the Amazon review suggests, the name can be seen in the scene where Charlie Sheen turns on his computer in the morning and finds out it's &quot;Gekko's Birthday&quot;) puts on such a mindblowing performance he really can be dubbed 'Gekko the Great'. The character is right up there with Don Vito Corleone, Tony Montana, Popeye Doyle and some other members of that elite group of high-octane male movie-characters that will long outlive the actors that created them.<br />Gordon Gekko is a high profile corporate raider that was probably modeled after Ivan Boesky (the biggest corporate raider of the 80's who eventually went behind bars for insider-trading), Michael Milken (creator and unchallenged 80's king of the high yield or junk-bond) and John Guttfreund (CEO of Salomon Brothers in the 80's who'se extravert and bizarre behaviour is documented in the classic books &quot;Liar's Poker&quot; (Michael Lewis) and &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; (John Helyar).<br />Michael Douglas seems to have been born to play this part and from the moment he is introduced (&quot;Lunch? whaddaya kiddin' me, lunch is for wimps!&quot;) to the moment we viewers have to part from his hypnotic character (&quot;I gave you Darian, I gave you everything!&quot;) he reduces any leaps of faith that his character may present us with to tiny hops due to his powerhouse presence. In fact, whenever I see Michael Douglas in another movie I have the strange feeling that Gordon Gekko is trapped inside and might burst out at any time to hose us down with sardonic one-liners. (&quot;Love is just an old lie created to keep people from jumping out of windows.&quot;)<br />Gekko is truly the &quot;mother of all high-rollers&quot;, and his performance alone more than warrants the purchase of this film. <br />Charles Sheen plays a believable 'Bud Fox' but one wonders what a late 80's Tom Cruise or Kiefer Sutherland might have done with the part. Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with.<br />I won't get into the details of the story here but will post some comments on the general themes in the movie.<br />There's the theme that Stone had already explored in 'Platoon' of two fathers fighting for the soul of their son. In Platoon it was Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe battling for custody of Charlie Sheen's spirit. In Wallstreet it's Douglas and Martin Sheen representing the 'exciting but evil' and 'wholesome but tedious' ways to go for Charlie Sheen's character. This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.<br />The other theme that Stone put into this narrative is the bleeding heart &quot;Capitalism is bad and unfair&quot; jingle. &quot;I don't produce anything...I own...&quot; Gekko confesses at one point. &quot;How many boats to waterski behind do you need? When is it enough?!&quot; cries a shocked Bud Fox. The moral comments on succesful capitalists come accros somewhat naive and in my opinion don't really work. I won't go into the details but most people I've met who've seen the movie don't even remember what it was about Gordon Gekko that was so wrong. All they remember is the classic &quot;Greed is Good&quot; speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue. The fact that Oliver Stone lets Gekko initiate industrial espionage is the reason I gave the movie only four stars instead of five.<br />I personnaly think this was a real blooper. A man in Gekko's position doesn't need the aggravation of blatantly breakin the law. There's a good plot-line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has his own plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale.  It seems as though Stone was so set on painting a negative picture of egoistical an a-moral Wallstreeters that he went one bridge too far. <br />Fact is that, if anything, this movie is like a recruiting video for Investment Banking. What &quot;Top Gun&quot; did for Naval Aviation &quot;Wall Street&quot; has done for Investment Banking. Big corporate banks have never had to complain about the amount of interested well educated young hopefulls but nowadays there's probably not one person sitting in any dealing room anywhere in the world who has not seen Wall Street. I am currently a trader in Amsterdam and I am convinced that if it wasn't for the scenes that have the camera following runners and stressed out yuppies yelling &quot;How about those september 40's!&quot; I wouldn't have been in this racket. <br />The dealing room-scenes are some of the most exhilirating scenes in the history of cinematography. Spielberg sucked in audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44. Stone creates the same spellbinding grip on the audience without getting anybody shot or brutally maimed. That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood. More so for the man who made a career in gory cinematic violence with 'Scarface', 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers'.<br />Al Hail Gekko the Great! See this movie again and again. It's full of catchy one-liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will. &quot;Life all comes down to a few moments...this is one of them.&quot;
6304819935|4.0|This is good horror film. The gore is pretty popular and violence is strong. I love this movie. Ash and his girlfriend take a trip to an old cabin and accidently plays a recording with a spell that brings the forest to life and posesses his girlfriend and also those who come to the cabin later on. Great special effects. Also, if you like this movie, rent Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, Dead Alive, or Army of Darkness.
B00003CXQX|3.0|The animation looks rushed. The basic idea is good but seems to have been pushed through to completion too fast. It does offer good clean viewing for kids but adults and teens might want something a little more intelligent. This cartoon is okay, but nothing special, although Kronk comes close to stealing the show.<br />Keep in mind, I'm a demanding viewer. You may like it a lot more than I did.
078062369X|4.0|By far the best vampire film I have ever seen!  Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half vampire half man on a mission to destroy all vampires, find a healing for himself, and find the vampire who killed his mother and made his what he is.  Great special effects and fighting.  This is for any fan of horror/action.  Rent this!
079073463X|5.0|This is a family favorite and I never get tired of the soundtrack. In fact, I bought the CD so I could listen to the main theme whenever. After seeing scores of generic Robin Hood, Seahawk and other medieval-type movies (with their generic, classical-music type soundtracks), Ladyhawke is something wonderfully different. It's a quiet, rather thoughtful movie, yet sports several well-done action scenes. If you're into horses at all, you will love the cathedrel fight.<br />See it at least once. You'll never forget the story.
B00005ATQI|5.0|The director is Stanley Kubrick, the actor is Jack Nicolson. Right there you know is a great movie. The Shining a great, bizaar thriller about insanity, and what is real. Jack Nicolson plays Jack, a retired teacher-turned writer whom is to take over the Overlook Hotel during the off-season. He becomes isolated and has a severe case of cabin feaver. Eventually, he becomes utterly insane and his wife and son must defend themselves in the middle of nowhere. But what Jack doesn't know, is his son's supernatural power, the shining. The movie, though, starts off slow but grows stronger and more exciting to build the climax. I strongly recommend this to any horror/Nicolson/Kubrick fan. By far, one of Kubrick's best.
B000002AHC|5.0|This album is perhaps the highwater mark of all the Byrds albums. It is certainly one of the best psychedelic pieces ever put out, with shades of country and folk thrown into the mix. David Crosby's influences abound, even though he was no longer in the band. Several of his best songs were left behind when he was unfairly booted out by Roger McGuinn. Draft Morning and Tribal Gathering are two of his finest compositions. The arrangements and vocal work are nothing short of inspiring. Truly a wonder in every aspect; this album is that good. With the remastered version we get tons of extra tracks including another Crosby masterpiece, Triad. The Byrds would never again reach the kind of plateau that was obtained here.
B00005ATQE|4.0|This is a great war movie.  I am a great fan of Stanley Kubrick, and this is one of his best.  The beginning starts off in bootcamp and is pretty up-lifting.  But becomes haunting and tragic.  The second half is about the Vietnam War (which is not as entertaining as the first half).  If you are a Kubrick fan, rent this, I guarantee you will enjoy!
0060920084|1.0|Having visited many of the locations he expounds upon I feel his general sour view on life comes through almost all the time.  He certainly didn't look for some of the interesting and beautiful attributes of many places.  His gratuitous foul language when offering a disgruntled view about a community certainly counters some of the very descriptive language he uses to introduce some communities or locations.  I only laughed twice in the entire book; both times were when he had a big dissapointment.  I started to feel that he really deserved the bad experience. This is likely my first and last time to read a Bill Bryson piece.
0792139771|5.0|This is one movie you shouldn't do without!  There are currently 487 reviews(including this one) and it's rating is 4 1/2 stars!  That says all you need to know, EVERYONE LIKES THIS MOVIE!  Except, maybe the Brittish...
B00004Z459|4.0|First off I'd like to say that Linkin Park is not metal, not nu-metal not thrash metal, definatly not heavy metal. Not that I'm putting Linkin Park down, but they aren't metal, They're just more of the offspring from that Rap/Rock hybrid music that has become so popular.<br />Now to the CD; Hybrid Theory is a decent start to a band that will either make it big or fall flat on their faces. My favorite tracks are Papercut, One Step Closer, Crawlin, Runaway and In the End. The thing about these songs is that they aren't just good but they are great, they won't play out too fast, meaning that you can listen to them over and over before you get sick of it. <br />The downside is that the other tracks aren't good, but the CD is worth buying just becasue of those 5 songs mentioned above.
0800179501|5.0|...this movie really stinks!  I gave it 5 stars because if I had given it 1 nobody would have read my review.  Judo chops and karate kicks are really cool...wait, no they aren't.  I think that Ralph Maccio and Pat Morita should have been cast in the opposite roles...Pat Morita (Miyagi)would make a far more convincing karate kid than Maccio does.  No amount of make-up can hide the fact that Maccio is actually an 85 year old, arthritic woman...c'mon.  The biggest question I had while watching the film though, was why Maccio wanted to know karate in the first place...why not just pack heat?  I don't care how good at kicking and chopping you are if someone's shooting at you.  Also, after seeing the director's cut (in the deleted scenes on the DVD version) I wonder why they left out the 1/2 hour of Maccio's kidnapping by an alien space ship.  It is interesting because it is there that we find out the crucial element of the film:  Maccio's real father is an intergalactic space monkey. Its crucial to understanding many of Maccio's motivations...and explains his great fondness for bananas.

0944379044|5.0|This book is great for any historian it shows the mindset of the Nazi regime at that time. It shows Hitler's fascination with a one world government ruled by only the perfect people of the world.  Which led to the extermination of the Jews.  It is great for any historian or any white power junkie looking for some hate.
B00004YA66|5.0|This movie rocks.  Talk about different angles.  This movie is the best movie I have seen this year.  So much suspense and so many twists.  Rates right up with sixth sense, stir of echoes, Meet Joe Black!.  Start out by sitting in your seat and you move forward throughout the movie until the end and Bam you fall off your seat!!
B000059TFO|5.0|If you like history or hate...this is the movie for you.  Two FBI agents are searching for 3 missing civil rights workers, who got what they deserved by the KKK, in Mississippi.  It is a good movie about a true story that happened in 1964.  It has some funny parts to it, like when they hang the...from a tree, or when they bomb the black churches.  It also has some sad parts to it, when they busted the KKK and sent them to jail.  Overall it is a good show of what life should be like today.
B00003CXE7|5.0|When is the prequel coming out???<br />If you have not seen this movie you must live in a cave - must see on DVD - VHS does not give the same result for the Unlease Hell track !<br />BUY IT, Borrow it or Rent it!
B000000WG4|5.0|Okay, to begin with, Tubular Bells is COMPLETELY different than almost anything else.  Therefore, it is hard to compare it with another album, but its it's own category.  Mike Oldfield is a master musician, playing about a dozen instruments that I hadn't even heard of.  (what is a glockenspeil?) The album is broken into 2 parts, each about 25 minutes.<br />The first side has the best instruments, especialy the end which you should listen to yourself.  The second half is cut from the same cloth and isn't as good instrumentaly, but it is more creative in some ways.  Of course, I'm refering to the &quot;Caveman Song&quot;, as its affectionaly called in my family.  This consists of a high-pitched growl mumbling things like &quot;so-wach, do, wanno!&quot;.  This is a high point of the album.  Alot of people think this is the worst part, but they should grow up.  These are the people who don't understand concepts such as &quot;unusual&quot; and &quot;new&quot; and, most importantly &quot;different&quot;.<br />Overall, THE instrumental album of  the 70's.  I havn't listened to other Oldfield stuff yet, but this is a good place to start.  I would most recomend this to fans of Pink Floyd's Ummagumma and other strange albums of that kin.
0767819462|5.0|Stepmom has a pretty good cast Given the right project and a director who cares about getting the best out of her. stepmom Starring Julia Roberts(Isabel)  and Susan Sarandon{Jackie) as a couple of women who fight for the hearts and minds  Stepmom is also about two strong independent women and apparent polar opposites who must find a way to connect. When Jackie discovers she is terminally ill and Isabel's relationship with Luke becomes serious, both women realize they must put aside their differences to save a family. The questions don't have easy answers: How do you hold a family together when the person who has been the rock, the most solid center of that unit one could imagine, gets sick Can another person take her place?
B00003W8NM|5.0|Deeper than The Matrix and richer than American Beauty, Fight Club was simply the best film of 1999.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I haven't been this warmly delited with a movie in a long time. What a wonderful story. So well crafted and so well told. The Soggy Bottom Boys rock. I found myself singing along with all the music in this movie. I would love to live in such a time and have such an adventure. This movie is a must see for all, and a must have in my collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you are like me, a five and a half year wait even for just one new Tool song is well worth it. Tool is a legacy; there is no two ways about it. Those of you who agree with me would relate to the fact that 'eulogy' has been arranged to be played at our funerals (not any time soon though), and that the NEMA cd hasn't left it's home from disc one in the car cd stacker since its release, or that after the five and a half years of listening to the NEMA from 'stinkfist' to 'third eye' you aren't over it, and never will be. Tool has the power to make you curl up in the foetal position and whimper like a baby, those who can understand that, are true Tool fanatics, those who can't, are detached from reality.
0380796090|5.0|...when I read this book!  I read &quot;Watermelon&quot; while on maternity leave following the birth of first child.  I laughed and cried---felt everything that our young heroine felt (well, almost everything---my husband stuck around, thankfully.)  Our ages are similar, our thoughts are similar...when she turned out okay, I knew I would, as well.  I loved this book!  The book has become a &quot;boy, do I have a book for you on your maternity leave&quot; tradition!
B0000524CY|5.0|Revisiting this movie after a long, long while, I was struck by how well-acted it remains.  The reason this &quot;horror&quot; film has stood the test of time is that we care - we feel pity for Linda Blair, we grieve with Ellen Burstyn, we can tell that Max von Sydow is far too old to still be fighting evil.  This version's added footage explores the characters a little more, in particular the mother-daughter bond.  The spinal tap footage is almost unbearable, far more so than any of the possession sequences, and why?  Because it is happening to a little girl, and we see how much that hurts her mother.  The only complaint that I have is that I wish the Devil had more dialogue - I would like to know why he chose this little girl and what exactly he is hoping to accomplish.  The scariest movie ever made?  That is open to debate. What is for certain is that this is a nice piece of filmmaking that manages to be fun and disturbing at the same time.
B00003CXSP|4.0|&quot;Hannibal&quot; was the second possibility for Hopkins to play this amazing, all people around the world shocking character Lecter. But he fails. All the genious that takes place in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, all the frantic and bizarre movements of his face, his hands and his body, are now followed by a normal acting, no shocking anymore, drawing quite a caricature of this character. It seems to me as if Hopkins is bored by acting.
B00005B36H|5.0|i became a tool fan long after their first three albums were released so lateralus was the first tool album i had the pleasure of waiting for. after listening to it for the second time, i decided that it is the best tool album so far. the band's maturity level has soared, both musically and emotionally. i have been seeing some very negative reviews, but i think the reason behind that is that the reviewers don't understand the album. lateralus is so deep and has so many layers that i'm not even going to go into them in this review. if you don't have this album, buy it asap. and let's not forget the cover. this is hands down the best cover art i have ever seen. once the outer black layer is removed, the viewer is treated to visuals rarely seen. not only that, but the art seems to intertwine with the album as a whole. like all of tool, don't look for singles. the album must viewed as a single entity. lateralus is the best example of this.
0790740443|3.0|I remember this movie. I don't think it topped the 30 million mark for domestic gross. I though that was unfair. Marketing had to do with it more than anything. The movie is not great but it isn't bad either. Sure it has some cheesy moments and some ridiculous dialogue. Very stupid at times too.<br />Well let's get on with the review. Special FX: This is where it shines and also has problems. The quality of the FX fluctuate. Some scenes are so well done. The sets are on the whole beautiful, the wind scenes are done as good as they can be. It's the several moments that just cut right into the big picture. (any space scene with a spaceship, or any scene with a moving projectile) The matte painting, sets are very well done but some scenes just look too fake.<br />Plot: Okay so what do you expect from an action flick. Plot will rarely score points. It is the predictability and cliches that actually take this movie down. You can guess every twist and turn. At least you won't be surprised.<br />Acting: Again in an action flick this takes a back seat. There isn't any acting that stands out to be &quot;BAD&quot;. And you are not going to expect any &quot;GREAT&quot; acting either. Kurt russell doesn't speak much. It isn't his fault. It's the character.<br />ETC aspects: I really don't have anything else to pick on except the unnecessary gore at times.<br />Okay final verdict. This is a viewable movie. I guess I wouldn't buy it because you would be able to watch it 3 times max. Bet renting it won't be too bad. 3.5 stars. Again I think it should have earned at least 40million domestic. Too bad it just collapsed. It wasn't THAT bad. Just one of those watchable films on some evening you have nothing else to do.

0440133688|5.0|Having read the book as a medical student, some contents proved at best foreign, strange, and at times shocking...as a surgical intern in an urban level one trauma center, many of the poignant episodes regarding such items as &quot;Gomers go to ground...&quot; are now scarily relevant. For those medical students seeking a true, but frequently exaggerated view of the life of a house officer (medicine, surgery,OB/Gyn etc.), this text will satisfy. Though dated with respect to some issues such as harrassment, you will find that the characters still exist...they're just working twenty years later in places like Atlanta, New York, Miami, and Shreveport.
B00003CXE6|1.0|I think Gladiator has to go down in cinema history as the worst movie ever to win any academy award(s) and yet, it got Best Picture. <br />First, the historical research into the period depicted was nonexistent. The initial battle scenes were done incorrectly, according to my Roman military historian friends, and the armor and weapons were totally wrong. Simon Atherton has no excuse for this; he could have consulted any number of reenactment groups in the UK for how to make Roman armor and weapons. <br />Then, when the movie company moved to Malta, things went downhill from there and never recovered. I remember some discussion about the slave tunics not being hemmed; they were made wrong in the first place, so it did not matter, anyway. <br />The costumes, which to my surprise, won an academy award, were also equally incorrect for the period, turning the cast into just about the silliest bunch of clowns I have seen in a long time, especially Crowe in that rediculous silver helmet worn in the gladiator scene. <br />However, sometimes a movie with bad background research can be redeamed by good acting. Gladiator has about the most wooden acting I have seen in a long time, but I can't blame Russell Crowe and other members of the cast, they had a terrible script to read. The plot line was nonexistent and went nowhere slowly, and the ending did not resolve anything except to strengthen my resolve to never to see a Ridley Scott film again. <br />The only way this disaster could have won the awards it did was due to somebody who owed somebody favors and &quot;lets my people get together with your people and we'll do lunch.&quot; <br />The one thing that deserved an Academy Award were the computer graphics which did to a very nice job on restoring the Coliseum.
B00000G3PA|1.0|This was without a doubt the worst big budget, big name star movie I've ever seen.  I'm not going to say anything about people screaming in space or the apparent presence of an atmosphere on an asteriod.  Inconsistancies like that don't bother me if a movie is at least entertaining.  This one wasn't.  It was two hours of people trying to pass off yelling at one another as acting.  The only entertaining actor in the movie (I don't want to ruin anything so I won't say who) gets killed, and it's not Bruce Willis.  Billy Bob Thornton played it so straight you wonder if he realized what a piece of... he was in.  The dialog was corny but delivered without the irony it deserved.  I felt like I was watching kids playing make believe.<br />This movie is full of cliches and obvious plays for emotion.  Does every Michael Bay movie have to have flags flapping in the wind or a group of heros striding across the tarmac?<br />This movie just goes on and on.  I was actually agitated by the end.  My biggest regret (aside from paying money to see this trash) is that the hacks that did this movie are going to do the same thing to Pearl Harbor.  The previews already look like Armageddon with Zero's instead of asteriods.  Save yourself money, unless you want a good laugh (there are some unintentional funny moments) get Space Cowboys instead.  That movie was unfairly compared to this one when it was released but it is far and away a better film.
0345441184|5.0|Man, this book was nothing short of amazing. You don't have to be a fan of Arthurian lore to enjoy what Marion Zimmer Bradley has given us. A book of fantasy, and realism combined with truth, love, honor, faith and hope. <br />The author has a way of making her readers get deeply involved with her characters. I cared for Morgaine and hated her all at the same time. I understood completely why she did what she did and was still mad about it. I admired and pitied Lancelet. He was a tremendous hero and athlete and very well respected. He was the simply the greatest and most honorable knight ever and yet... how sad that his one  true love, his soulmate, Gwenhwyfar, could never, ever, be his. To have her and betray the love he shared with his best friend and king, Arthur, hurt him more deeply than any sword could ever do. <br />Marion Zimmer Bradley really captured the essence of the struggle between the &quot;new&quot; religion, christianity, and the older , more sensible, spiritual ways of Avalon and the Goddess. The book &quot;Conversations with God&quot; kept coming to mind the more I read. Very similiar ideals.&quot;All the Gods are One God&quot; is the final lesson of this story. No matter what different names are given for them, they are all one in the same. This is what Morgaine finally learns after all her years of struggle and this revelation gives her her... peace.<br />Excellent story. Expressed through the eye's of the key women in during the era of King Arthur. It never falters. Makes you anxious for the next page and leaves you sad when you are finished.
B00004XONN|5.0|I bought &quot;Kid A&quot; after buying the amazing &quot;OK Computer,&quot; somewhat knowing what to expect.  Though I got what I wanted, I got so much more.<br />The critics lauded &quot;OK Computer&quot; as one of the greatest albums of the 90s, calling Radiohead genius and limit pushers.  Surely if Radiohead had made &quot;OK Computer II&quot; the fans would have loved it, the concerts would be sold out in a flash, and the critics would have still ate it up.<br />So what does Radiohead do?  They go back to the studio for a long period of time and produce &quot;Kid A,&quot; an album that totally departs from anything Radiohead has done in the past, and album that takes a patient, artistic ear to appreciate.  &quot;Kid A&quot; contains few real verses or refrains, no hooks, and usually just a build up of electronica or maybe one simple guitar chord repeated over and over.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is airy, concept-full, disembodied, and a little inaccessible.  It seems as though a lot of people think that this album is just something the critics liked because Radiohead did it, and that it was so different.  I beg to differ.  The album really took some deep thinking to create.<br />There are no real &quot;songs&quot; in the traditional sense; in fact, nearly the entire album literally flows together, switching from one direction to another gracefully and slowly.  There are no stand-out tracks that are pleasing to listen to; you have to absorb the sometimes off-key, out-of-tune music slowly.  'Everything In Its Right Place' (such an appropriate title, because you know that that's not true) opens with just a few minor-key electric piano chords, which sound too easy to be on a huge artist's album.  And then a whole bunch of heavly synthed &quot;voices&quot; are heard, and Yorke is just singing a lot of &quot;blips, blehs,&quot; and &quot;bluhs.&quot;  This continues and gets even more synthed and alien on the bell-looped 'Kid A,' which sounds something like a future lullabydiddy for children (or clones, as the case may be).  'The National Anthem' finally lets guitars come into the melody, but only the bass, layered against spooky sounding whooshes of synths.  And also on this track Yorke's vocals actually sound somewhat human.  Then, midway through the track, these off-key brass and wind instruments start buzzing in, out of tune with each other.  Towards the end, it sounds as though the whole brass band is willingly walking off of a cliff.  'How To Disappear Completely,' my favorite, is a song with a simple guitar chord, and a far-off sad synthesizer slowly screaming in tune with Yorke's angstful voice (just listen to him sing over and over &quot;...I'm not here... this isn't happening&quot;)- he just sounds so mellow, but hopeful at the same time.  'Treefingers' is your average ambient song, sounding extremely similar to the work of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp.  'Optimistic' sounds almost- almost like your average Radiohead song, full of far-off guitars and average Yorke vocals.  The dizzy, sometimes haze-like 'In Limbo' is the ultimate song if you've just come off of a roller coaster (it'll only make you more sick to your stomach).  'Idioteque' is the closest Radiohead ever got to a pure techno song, but this has a soul to it.  It has a wishy, repetitive percussive sound to it; oversampled is something like a drawn-out bell sound.  'Morning Bell' seems to be other reviewers favorites, but I guess it's a little too avant-garde and dark for me, with a minor, evil sounding chord and Yorke singing &quot;...cut the children in half...&quot;  The album ends with a track ('Motion Picture Soundtrack) that sounds something like a funeral song, with and organ and a harp in the melody.  Also, a hidden 'track' occurs at the back of the album, which sounds something like all the tracks mixed into one as they float to heaven.  It's almost as if this album is conceived in 'Everything In Its Right Place,' born in 'Kid A,' and dies and then resurrects in 'Motion Picture Soundtrack.'  Now for an album to do that, well, it's got to be pretty interesting.  <br />I suppose this album is about the dangers of cloning and playing God, but it's not really that easy to decode. It is VERY avant-garde and only the most unrefined, open-minded ears will appreciate this album.  However, don't get too much into this album, because if you listen to it straight through without stopping, you'll find that it took you somewhere way out there, in the loose fabrics of reality, but you're not sure where.  And if you stay out there too long, I'm afraid there could be long term side affects.
0375420525|3.0|As much as I love experimental music, I just can't handle the fictional brother.  This book was a monumental task for me to read . . . mostly due to the rambling footnotes (which are sometimes nothing more that tediously lengthy lists).<br />House of Leaves is basically a wonderful idea and a book with a few truly disturbing images . . . that is surrounded by needless experimental TEDIUM.  I commend the author on having the balls to write something as freakish and risky in such a spoonfed  environment.<br />There are two good storylines:  The main story of Navidson and the house, and the footnoted story of Johnny Truant and his mad obsession with the Navidson record and the house.  The rest is just something to suffer through.  When I closed the book, I was disgusted and sorry that I had wasted so much time with it. This is a rare thing for me.  What a terrible feeling.<br />Perhaps I have missed the point of House of Leaves.  I certainly would never trudge through it again to try to &quot;get it.&quot;
B000001ESF|5.0|&quot;listen to my music. hear what it can do. there's something here thats as strong as life. i know that it will reach you&quot;. and it will. Rush takes a leap into the future to the year 2112. and its one heck of a trip! 30 years ago, no one would have expected the canadian trio to pull off such a complex piece of music. 2112 is a masterpiece. the entire album provides the listener with a mesmorizing experience as only Rush can deliver. This is truly a landmark in the progressive rock era. dont get left in the past. buy this album.
B00004XONN|5.0|I don't know of any other band that can pull of the difficult task of reinventing itself and still creating great music. Radiohead pulls away from its earlier work with conventional guitar and drums, and immerses the band into a more electronic and techno type of orientation.  I love the way that lead singer Thom Yorke can sound so somber and melancholy, and then completely turn around and wail a commanding note that sends shivers up the back of a kicking, squealing gucci little piggy. Congrats on bringing home the best alternative grammy without selling your soul.  A must for any true radiohead.
0792842723|5.0|This movie is about some traders in the KGB, that stole an EMP device to destroy the evidence of a massacre they committed although a girl hid in a cupboard and was the only wittness.  Bond comes to get information from her to track them down meanwhile destroying every vehicle he gets into.  This movie was thrilling and you never knew what was going to happen next.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has not disappointed someone who expected to be disappointed with their latest achievement.  In contrast, it excelled my wildest expectations.  Some Tool fans will not like this CD as much as Aenima because it doesn't really have any &quot;radio friendly&quot; songs, you know, 'sing the verse, scream the chorus, jump up and down.'  Instead this CD takes everything about the concept of song writing and throws it into and eccentric blender to actually come up with musical concepts and structure that is almost frighteningly scientific.  I don't think any band that is mainstream has the talent or the courage to pull off what Tool does with Lateralus.  Some musicians' talent actually lags behind the rest of the band for the sake of the music, not Tool.  They truly achieve the highest cooperative level while stretching the very limits of their talent.  Think of an ok band with a really good guitar player.  Tool is the great guitar player with the amazing drummer, and the killer bassist.  I'm sure I don't even need to mention the front man.  Buy this CD only if you want to see what music 'could be'.
B00003CXBK|5.0|'Princess Mononoke' was not at all what I expected.  I wasn't looking forward to this film, anticipating that it would be a little too 'pokemon-ish' for my taste.  I was pleasantly surprised to find an intelligent and artistic film with quite possibly the best in animation.  The backgrounds are breathtaking and very realistic.  The characters were all interesting and believable.  <br />As an added bonus...this has by far, the BEST character voices I've seen in a long time.  Gillian Anderson, Billy Bob Thornton, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, Minnie Driver...do I even need to go on?  TOP NOTCH performances, esp. by Anderson as Moro the wolf-goddess.  What a great character!<br />This movie is not only appropriate for children, it should be a requirement.  The colorful and interesting characters will hold their interest and the message from this story is clear from the begining.  Best of all, adults can enjoy this one too.  Highly recommended.
0440219078|5.0|I first read this book in elementary school shortly after it came out. The book was shocking and disturbing to me then. Now, the book provides a striking commentary and warning about and to modern society. In this age, when genetic and psychological manipulation does not seem far-fetched, Lowry's story depicts a world where a centrally-controlled, perfectionistic society proves that man cannot be truly happy and determine the most fundamental relationships of society. I highly recommend this book.
079073639X|4.0|I personally thought 'Sphere' was a good movie.  It offers a fair share of suspense, action, good special effects and interesting characters.  What more could you ask for?  Oh, how about an all-star cast...well, it has that too.<br />The basic premise of the movie is that a 300 year old space ship was found at the bottom of the ocean and a team of specialists are assembled to investigae it.  The specialists include a psychologist (Dustin Hoffman), a biologist (Sharon Stone), a physicist (Liev Schrieber), a mathematician (Samuel Jackson), led by the seemingly fearless military force (Peter Coyote).  They soon discover a gold sphere inside the huge ship, that possesses special powers that transform thoughts into reality.  Sounds good...well, not when the characters can only conjur up the most horrific nightmares imaginable. The ride that the viewer is taken on is an equal mix of reality and fantasy, but you can never really tell what is and is not imagined.  <br />While I fully appreciate that this is not an original concept (read Solaris and you'll see what I mean) it is still an interesting concept.   This film forces the viewer to actually think instead of being led along by the hand, while the plot smacks you in the face, like SO many movies (sci-fi or otherwise).   The movie, for the most part, is fast paced and filled with a sense of foreboding (although it does miss a beat or two in a few places).  Our heroes are not that at all, and we find ourselves not only rooting but relating to these characters.  What a nice change of pace to have tragically flawed and multi-faceted characters instead of the garbage that is passed off these days.  After all, some of us are bored with kick-boxing and explosions.  <br />Stone's performance is noteworthy because she makes her character seem neurotic and reasonable all at the same time.  We can't really trust her, yet she may be making the most sense.  Jackson's portrayal of Harry is absolutely chilling and right on the money.  Hoffman as the ever-reasonable and supportive psychologist, lacks the ability to doubt his own sense of reality, making his character the weakest, yet seemingly the strongest.  They start the journey as 'elite specialists' , the all-knowing, all-seeing gods of their respective fields.  They banter back and forth about their intelligence, education and preparedness for this quest, yet their intelligence and education cannot save them from their own limitations as humans.   Their humanity is what nearly destroys them and ultimately saves them in the end.  <br />You have to really watch this with an open mind and try to focus on character interplay to really appreciate this movie.  No, it isn't perfect, but it is entertaining and intelligent...a rarity these days.  If you aren't willing to actually THINK as you go along, then I recommend a Steven Segal movie.
0312243022|5.0|Maybe the readers who don't like this book were in a hurry...this book requires, almost demands, to be read slowly, deliberately, and not in one sitting.<br />I've not found a book in recent time that held my attention and drew me into the story more than this one. I read it after hearing a piece on NPR...and I've passed my copy on to friends who have also enjoyed the wonderfully crafted prose.<br />Although there are three separate stories going at one time, I never felt disjointed or disrupted during the shifts.<br />I've even re-read the book three times and will read it again...it's that good.<br />If you can get beyond some of the negative reviews, and if you can give yourself time to absorb the Cunningham's glorious prose, you just might find a gem of a story just waiting to be unearthed.<br />Enjoy!
0380778556|4.0|This suspenseful novel is, by a long shot, Daphne DuMaurier's most popular. The realistic character development, the complex relationships and the thickening plot makes it an enjoyable novel.  As the book goes on, the reader's curiosity for this mystifying character, Rebecca, grows. However, the reader is lead in the wrong direction at first and thus is very surprised at the shocking news that is discovered.  As the book draws to an end you become anxious for the main character. Sympathy is given to Mrs. De Winter and then thrilling information is revealed as all the puzzle pieces fit together.  This novel is surely an incredible experience; I encourage all to read it (if you can stand your heart beating and fast paces)
B00005B36H|4.0|Not owning, but having heard some of the material from Tool's other releases, I thought that the release of Lateralus would've been a great opportunity to start buying some Tool albums. I was hoping for a release like Opiate, a cynical cd with some great lyrics and hard hooks. Possibly a more rounded album like nema, or hard like Undertow. I got Lateralus, individual at least but too hard to swallow. The anger present from Tool's previous releases has been turned down to minimal and the cynicism went with it. Overall we're left with a complex album with very long and drawn-out songs (8, 9, even an 11-minute song). Schism is a clear radio song because of it's simpler (still complex however) structure and its catchy lyrics. The Grudge is an amazing opener, all 8:36 of it, with a very powerful refrain and very moving musical part. Tracks like Eon Blue Apocalypse, Mantra, and Faaip De Oiad are simply either short instrumental tracks or noise which have no meaning whatsoever, they just make the album look bigger. Parabol and its big brother song, Parabola are two amazing songs which flow into each other in a very slick way. Ticks &amp; Leeches is somewhat of a return to the Tool we all know and love, a percussive track with heavy guitar and bass and Maynard's angry, sick-of-it-all lyrics. The album's closer, Faaip De Oiad (Voice Of God), is an odd track to say the least, about 2 minutes of static with a guy crying about UFOs and extraterrestrials. Overall, I really like the cd a lot, it's definitely worth a purchase, if not an extended listen, but it's very drawn out and sluggish at times. Still very good though, 4/5 stars.
0553565915|5.0|I found this book sitting on my parents bookshelf yesterday.  It had been there for years but I had never even opened it.  I started reading and couldn't put it down.  It was so fabulous!  This book greatly changed my outlook on God, heaven, and Christianity.  I believe that it has changed my life.  I am 15 with clinical depression, social anxiety disorder, and bulimia.  I have read many self-help books with no avail, yet this one gave me hope.  For months I have been struggling with my Christian relationship and wondering why God would &quot;punish&quot; me like this.  This book helped me to realize that this IS a growing experience and God would never deal me anything that I could not deal with or lead to me grow from.  It also assisted in coming to terms with my friend's suicide and made me realize how her death had made me a more compassionate and caring person.  This book gives me hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and made me realize that the spirit has the power to overcome anything (with patience) through God.  YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK! I pray that everyone can gain as much from this book as I have.
0790729970|5.0|No matter what movie I watch, I love Jim Carrey.  This movie is about a lonely guy that is kind of a nerd.  He finds a mask in a body of water one night, and decides to bring it home.  Once he gets it home he puts in on and of course strange things happen.  His dog has a sixth sense about the mask and tries to warn Jim about the mask, but of course he does not heed the warning.  He puts the mask on and you will have to watch it from there....  If you are a big cartoon fan you will love this movie, it is a movie with humans, but shaped like looney toons cartoons.
B000003KCU|2.0|Okay, I do like this movie but I have seen a much longer version than this on network TV. I brought this video version of this movie last week just because I thought it will have new scenes. But guess what it's only the original version that was filmed in the theater, no new scenes. I wish I can take my video back and wait for the DVD version to come out so that they can show the deleted scenes. If you want to see a longer version of this movie you can catch it on TBS Superstation or TNT if it ever comes on again on those channels it will have the new scenes. Trust me! <br />WARNING - If you buy this video you won't see the new scenes that were shown on Network TV it's just the original version that was filmed in the theater no new scenes. Sorry!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|I hope you're in the mood because this wondrous CD is an atomic blast of musical innovation and political anger. Since I only listen to 5 star, top notch material and nothing less, this final studio album from Zach and Co. is a welcome addition to my collection. To be honest, the real star of &quot;Battle...&quot; is Tom Morello who delivers one stunning performance after another. From the swirling hurricane intro to &quot;Testify&quot; (a sixties-ish heavy riff that never lets up) to the Zeppelin inspired, godzilla-sized roar that opens &quot;Born Of A Broken Man&quot;, His guitar playing scales astonishing new heights! Though it's been out for almost 2 years now, this album has lost none of it's wall rattling, eardrum splitting appeal. TURN THAT S**T UP!

HAIL ROB HALFORD!! HAIL HEAVY METAL!!
B00003CXRM|4.0|I can't really comment on the technical format or quality of the DVD, since I know nothing about this. What I can say is that the Coen brothers are really strengthening their reputation as one of the few truly intelligent acts in Hollywood. Loosely adapted from Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, this film is truly &quot;American&quot;; icons such as apple pie, Americana music and Dapper Dan hair care(does or did it actually exist?) permeate this movie and it looks great. One does not really need to see it in terms of the original Odyssey: it's perfectly enjoyable even if you can't really remember Homer's version. George Clooney and the rest of the cast are stunning. The photography is amazing. My personal favourite moment: a midnight Ku Klux Klan gathering that is so well choreographed and so grotesque, you have to say to yourself that The Coen brothers are now a major force in shaping American cinema. Watch out for their new movie &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot;
B00004XOWM|1.0|i think that anyone who thinks that this album is &quot;a work of genius&quot; should wake up and smell the coffee!  Rap is dead.  Fred durst killed it.  Limp is completely untalented, and if i could have given it zero stars i would have.  Fred Durst thinks he's so cool just because he swears a lot.  if you think he is full of angst, and anger... gimme a break... u want angst, listen to joy division, or nirvana.  not pop.  he swears to sell albums.  limp bizkit is a disgrace to rock.
0694003611|5.0|My 9 month old son does not sit still.  When he crawls to his books (around 15 board books) he always picks out Goodnight Moon.  The simple words and different voices make this books a delight to read.  It's become a fast bedtime ritual.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|First of all, the music of the Beatles is so ingrained in the Western Culture, many people have been conditioned to like them.  Second of all, this album has nothing to do with their music.  &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; has everything to do with marketing.  And guess what, the general population fell for it!!  This album is going to be the highest selling ever.  It has everything to do with getting inside people's pocketbooks and making money, rather than producing good music.  Anyone with any sense in business knows that anything containing the word &quot;Beatles&quot; is going to sell well.  Congratulations people, you have fell for another marketing ploy.
6302293553|5.0|It's a great movie.  It is amazingly funny since Monty Python are known for their skits and this is a full length feature.  It's BBC meets MGM.  Medieveal times like one has never seen before nor will ever see again.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I can't help but find all of the very negative reviews on this CD very pathetic. First of all, if you hate Brintey so much and would never buy the CD anyway, you must have a lot of time on your hands to come and trash her. Get a life!! Second of all: for people who say this isn't real music, then why has it sold close to 10 million albums, and why do I see people at clubs and in their cars rocking out to Britney. Don't say Brintey isn't making music cuz of the synthesizers either, it is more of a techn influence and is the music of the future. And just because she doesn't sing about death and &quot;deep&quot; stuff like that doesn't mean she isn't making music. Take this album for what it is: pure fun. It isn't depressing rock or &quot;meaningful&quot; sould music, it is just fun, dancable music that is making the younger generations rock out. Give the bad reviews a rest people, cuz having such a hatred for Brintey is hurting you more than it is hurting her.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Great sound and picture quality. I dont want to refer to Band's awesome live performance &lt;God i just did :)&gt; Approximatly three hours of live performance including Metropolis(part 1), Mirror, Lie &lt;You can find those in the behind the scenes documentery&gt; A mind beside itself, Learning to live. But for me the most exciting thing to see was A Change Season performed in its entirity with Rudess' contribution. For the ones who could caught up with DT's world tour you can see yourselves in the World Tour photo album. And if you tought that LTE performence is missing from the DVD you'll find in this section a very good performed Acid Rain at the background. I only got one critic to make and it is : there is no intra band footage. I mean you never can hear your favorite band members talking to eachother. There arent any scenes like the ones in 5 years in a live time video. If you have a DVD player dont miss the chance to get this DVD it will SHOW YOU KINDNESS, BEAUTY AND TRUTH...
1558216847|5.0|The Long Walk is an absolute &quot;must read&quot; for just about anyone. It reads like an adventure novel and one is inclined to forget that every word is true and describes the almost unbelievable courage of a small group of escapees from a Soviet Siberian Labor Camp. These determined souls suffered hardships that nearly defy description from the moment of incarceration to the final steps in their four thousand mile walk to freedom. It is a real page turner and that rare book that makes you want to go back to page one and start all over!
B000003BEM|2.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums the Rolling Stones have released over their long career. The problem, as is the case with all the Universal/ABKCO Rolling Stones releases on CD, is the poor audio quality and packaging. These releases were remastered in the mid 80's using the current technology of the time. The packaging is minimal and the CD only has the original album tracks thus the disc is short.   If you can hold out wait until these albums finally get the treatment they deserve -- at least 20bit remastering, new packaging and extra/bonus tracks to use up the empty 50% of the capacity of CD -- otherwise listen to the vinyl, it sounds much better!   The record company &quot;monopoly monsters&quot; today continue to sell to unsuspecting customer CD's that were &quot;remastered&quot; at the dawn of the CD age, at close to full price for a disc that is half the length of a new disc today, with terrible audio quality and packaging. The original Beatles albums are also still sold in this way as are the Warner Brothers albums of Van Morrison for example. I have worked in the music industry for a number of years and know from experience, particularly today, the industry is run by a bunch of marketing &quot;spin doctors,&quot; lawyers and accountants who know little to nothing about music - to them it is just &quot;product&quot; to be moved. To paraphrase Tom Dowd, if you asked one of them for a &quot;note&quot; they would probably pull a bank note from their pocket.
0684853523|5.0|One part autobiography, one part writing guide.  Stephen King answers the questions that most of his readers ask, like, &quot;Where do you get your ideas?&quot;  A very good mix.  If you would like background information about one of today's best authors, as well as a guide to make a good writer great, this is the book to read!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is amazing and it was worth the wait for sure! The only tracks i dont like are Eon Blue Apocalypse, Mantra, and Faaip de Oaid, which are not even songs. Greatest track is Parabola. Amazing album. I cant wait to see TOOL at Edgefest 2001!!!!
B00003CXE6|5.0|This may not be totally true to Roman History, but it is a beautifully done film of that genre.  Russell Crowe is excellent and certainly did earn his Oscar.  I love Roman History and I enjoyed this film very much.  As for the critics, all I can say is, can you make something half as good?
B00005AFMT|5.0|A stunning first album from the Belew-Fripp-Levin-Brufford line up of KC. This terrific remaster is (for a limited time) in a gatefold sleeve and includes a great booklet with newsclippings about the band's first album. Fripp has also added a bonus track (an alternate version of Matte Kundasai)something that was missing from the previously reissued CDs from the KC catalog.<br />Clearly influenced by Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel and, yes, the Beatles Discipline demonstrates the band in great form. While  some of the instrumentals are a little weak, the great songwriting of the first three tracks help offset these weak tracks. Yes, lots of fans could argue that this album was the strongest of the trio released in the 80's by the BFLB line up. The follow up album (Beat) is more unified in sound and texture and almost as stunning (although the material is a bit thinner).<br />Fripp finally found the perfect foil in Adrian Belew. Belew's guitar playing, intelligent lyrics and singing help make this one of the finest line ups assembled by Fripp. Levin's use of the stick and Brufford's drumming also add a unique flavor to the 80's line up. A pity that both Levin and Brufford aren't with the current version (although thankfully, Belew still is a member).<br />It's understandable why Fripp revived the KC name. Fripp has commented in the past that there's music that is just....Crimso music. It felt right to him to revive the name (it helped that KC is a name brand as well).
0679759328|5.0|Potential Readers Beware: This book is subtle, intelligent, witty, heartbreaking, arid, sensuous, eloquent and luminous. If you are looking for a rollicking, wham-bam-thank-you-maam plot, look elsewhere. Anita Brookner writes of the quiet and unnoticed desperation of women and men of a certain age. If you give yourself over to this book and this writer, the reward will be lasting.
0684135051|5.0|This knitting book is ground-breaking. Instead of following a pattern line by line (nothing wrong with that, I like to do that) you learn how to create sweaters to fit any body, with any yarn. Why would anyone want to do that? Well, you might have bought 15 balls of  yarn on sale and don't know what to make of it. Instead of waiting for a pattern to turn up for that amount of yarn, that weight, etc, you can create your own sweater in various styles to fit anyone, you, a family member or friend.<br /><br />The Percentage System used in this book is easy to follow: knit a sample of your yarn, carefully measure how many stitches per inch or centimeter, then multiply that gauge times your chest circumference MINUS 10 percent for the ribbing. Increase up to 100 percent and off you go. Soon you will have a yoke style sweater, Norwegian drop shoulder or saddle shoulder, or even raglan style. Such freedom. You can go to  yarn sales and as long as you have enough yarn, you can make anything from it.<br /><br />Right now I am knitting a cotton summer top using this method with some bargain yarn. While this book doesn't have gorgeous color photographs of stylish knits, it does teach you to create your own. After I bought this book, my knitting really took off. Yours might, too.
0767832248|5.0|Penny Marshall directed a fascinating movie when she brought to screen Oliver Sacks' book AWAKENINGS.  It captures New York City beautifully during the early part of the century, and later in the 1960's.  The story unfolds around the doctor based on Oliver Sacks.  The patients represent a true 'awakening' that occurred in New York with the drug L-Dopa.  This event has become so important in the history of medicine that a Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Arvid Carlsson, mentioned this event in his Nobel Lecture in the year 2000.  Penny Marshall had a tremendous vision bringing this event to screen in 1990.  It is an incredibly moving film.

0141000198|5.0|Cannot say enough of these two books.  BRIDGET is a must read for all singletons, regardless of age, gender or sexual persuasion.  Take a work day off (explained to boss, understood completly, bless him) buy a bottle of white wine (pinot grigio is wine of choice, chardonnay much too strong) and a  couple packs of Marlboro's (purely for medicinal purposes, you understand) and laugh yourself into a druken stupor while yelling &quot;That's me&quot; at every turn of the page and hope your neighbors don't call the police.  Must run, BRIGET movie starts in 15 minutes!!! (pity, movie theaters don't offer white wine to their clientele.)
B000002UCN|3.0|In my humble opinion, this is what should be done to get a decent George Harrison compilation CD: take the second half of this CD (the 1970-1975 hits, remastered of course), add to it 80% of the Best of Dark Horse CD (the 1976-1989 hits, also remastered), add a few strong album tracks from both periods, a couple live songs from both the Bangla Desh and Live in Japan CDs and maybe 1 or 2 rare tracks. All together with nice packaging, clever liner notes and some rare photos will make for an excellent double CD of George's true best material. Record executives, please hear our call, if you do it will sell by the hundreds of thousands!
B00003CXP1|5.0|I too saw this in the theaters, graphic and stunning.  But I've read two separate reviews (apparently quite helpful to folks) lamenting the R-rated editing of the movie.  Problem is, while one review was written for the regular version (rated R), another impassioned review was written for this Director's Cut (unrated = NC17?).  Is this cut indeed the version seen in theaters, or is this one step down from the theatrical release (the R version being two steps down)?  Could someone clarify this?  Thanks.
0670880728|5.0|Bridget was so hysterical because she touched a place in all of us who have ever been single (when those around us are not)and who were able to laugh at our own feet of clay - our own mistakes in judgement, our own vulnerabilities.  Her obsession over her weight, her need to quit smoking, her excessive need for alcohol, and her failures in relationships with members of the opposite sex were so humorously represented that we not only felt her pain, we laughed her laughs. The thing I most enjoyed about this book was re-reading parts of it long distance with my 30-something single daughter late into the night, giggling hysterically over paragraph after paragraph together.  What a bonding tool!
B00005J6T1|5.0|These days, many people compare Madonna's early music to Britney Spears or the Spice Girls, but there really is no comparison. Today's bubble gum pop stars have a host of producers, songwriters, and stylists to create a cookie-cutter image for them that can be marketed to the mainstream. Madonna, however, was a very different story. At the time she recorded this album, Madonna was living in the ghettos of New York City, and hanging out at clubs that were largely populated by minorites. In other words, she was NOT part of the mainstream! In addition, most of the songs on this album began life as demos that Madonna wrote and recorded HERSELF in a tiny apartment without the help of a host of producers or marketing execs. She also had developed her own unique fashion sense. Madonna didn't have to consult a crew of stylists; even when she was penniless in New York, she had her own style down pat! Unlike today's manufactured pop princesses, Madonna was a true musical and visual artist at work, long BEFORE she signed a record contract.<BR><BR> That said, this album invented dance-pop as we know it. Highly synthesized and highly danceable, this was the style of music that took the 1980s by storm, and still exists today in many forms (including the electronica that Madonna currently dabbles in!). The album was revolutionary, because it brought the underground worlds of urban dance music and punk into the mainstream world of pop. The punk elements are heard in the scorching single &quot;Burning Up&quot;, which prominently features an electric guitar and a rock-like bassline, but in a clubby, danceable song. Also, Madonna's personality comes through very strong on this album, so you never feel like you are listening to an anonymous &quot;dance diva&quot;. Even on pedestrain fare like &quot;I Know It&quot; and &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;, Madonna sings with so much conviction that you KNOW she means it!<BR><BR> When the album was first released, people assumed Madonna was African American, and her music was played primarily on R&amp;B stations... she was not immediately accepted by the pop world, and was truly a cutting-edge &quot;fringe&quot; artist who redefined pop. In addition to being a great historical document, this album is worth buying because it's so much FUN! What party is complete without classics like &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot;, or &quot;Lucky Star&quot;? These songs have stood the test of time, because, unlike Britney and Co., Madonna is an innovator, NOT an imitator, and she has been innovative since day one, as this album proves.

0767819659|3.0|We are currently going through a major addiction to all things Madeline and especially this movie. It represents my daughter's first venture into a fantasy world (she's 4.5 yrs) that she has created for herself and she now spends her days repeating bits of the film, pretending to be Madeline or Miss Clavel and generally being happy playing. I'm not sure how much I really like this movie as I've now watched it upwards of 20 to 30 times. I doubt even the filmmakers thought anyone would study any film so closely. I'm now looking for contunity errors or obscure turns of phrases to keep me interested! As other reviews have said, the movie really departs from the books and creates its own world. The art direction of the film is very good but the movie seems to lack some final layering that would make it a truly memorable film. Frances McDormand seems to sleep walk through the film or wasn't given enough to do. The kids roles are good, however. But the proof is in my child: she's obsessed. For that, I don't mind. It could be something like Eminem or  Pokeman.
B000002KJQ|1.0|Please avoid buying the remaster of this record.I only hope Warner Brothers restores the record back to the original &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;punchy&quot; version.It's like putting a mustache on the Mona Lisa! Get the vinyl.
B00005AQGH|5.0|To keep it short, if you like 2pac, you got to have this album. He said everything thought that was on his mind before he &quot;died&quot; and he said it with such passion. Its a little hard for the weak of mind, but, you'll never hear another 2pac album with soo much power behind its lyrics. Best songs have to be Life of an outlaw, Live and Die in LA, and Against all odds but every song is incredible, like &quot;white man's world&quot; and &quot;Hail Mary&quot;.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Near the end of 2000 in many best-of-the-year lists, music critics started raving about an unknown band from Iceland with some kooky name you could barely pronounce who had apparently put out an album that was supposedly one of the most amazing records anyone would ever hear. Right before that, Thom Yorke of Radiohead had sung the praises of this band, and by the beginning of 2001, both hipster wannabe's and obsessive Radiohead fans alike desperately sought out the album by Sigur Ros, if only to display it as their own Badge of Hipness, the one thing that would tell them they were cool.<br />And I was one of those people, I'm sorry to say. I had barely heard of the band, but since December 2000 I had been trying to find the cd in record stores, with no success, feeling somewhat gullible searching for a cd that some lousy writers said was great. What the heck did they know? Well, I have to say, after listening to Agaetis Byrjun countless times, all that hype was warranted.<br />Simply put, this is one of 2000's best albums, perhaps one of the best of this young decade. Pick your adjective: ethereal, enigmatic, sensuous, ambient, trancelike...those have been the buzzwords describing Sigur Ros, but not one word can pin down the sound. Slow beats, bowed guitars, beautiful orchestration, and the otherworldly (there's another buzzword) vocal talents of Jon Por Birgisson (which echo Yes's Jon Anderson) make this album sound like it was sent to us from another planet. Every song is a standout, from the cult favourite 'Svefn-g-Englar' to the string-accompanied 'Staralfur' to the sing-along melody of 'Olsen Olsen'. Although it's seventy-one minutes long, not a second sounds wasted.<br />The lyrics and song titles add to the album's mystery: it's all in Icelandic, except for 'Olsen Olsen', which is sung in an Icelandic-English-jibberish hybrid the band dubs &quot;Hopelandic&quot;. Besides, Sigur Ros insis the lyrics don't mean anything anyway; it's the overall feel of the music that counts. And it's you're reaction to this music that truly defines the sound of Agaetis Byrjun...some may say it's dark, some may say it sounds bleak, but when you listen carefully to the layers of music on this most stunning record, the true definition begins to surface until you're smiling in beatific reverie: life-affirming.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Stevie's solo albums have been, song to song, hit-and-miss affairs, and the bottom line on &quot;Shangri-La&quot; is that she bats close to .750. That's as well as she's done since &quot;Bella Donna&quot; two decades ago. Skip over clunkers like &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot; and the execrable &quot;Love Changes,&quot; don't dwell long on the musical and lyrical junk heap of the title track, and you're left with a disc worthy of worship. &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; may be a meteorological muddle, but it's gorgeous and propulsive, with one of the mightiest vocal performances Stevie has delivered in a good long while. &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot; takes three or four listens, after which it emerges as a beautiful mood piece, although why Stevie invited Macy Gray for a guest vocal and then left her virtually absent from the audible mix is a mystery. &quot;I Miss You, &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; are gorgeous, in part because Stevie lets others assist with or take over the songwriting chores on the first three and wrote the fourth back in the early 1970's. It's unclear what that means for her enduring talents as a composer. But as a singer, she's come through decades of physical and emotional wear and tear with an alto that's deeper and coarser but as compelling as ever. She still casts a mighty spell, and there's magic -- not trouble -- in &quot;Shangri-La.&quot;
B00005B36H|5.0|Is this CD great? Yes, once again Tool has come out with an album that sounds impressive at first, then as you begin to feel out the lyrics becomes amazing. I drive constantly for my job, and this new work keeps me pumped throughout the trips from home to 4 hours away.Time dissaptes when this CD plays, the tracks work their way into the layers of my brain and pull me to my destination; and once I get there I have this sneaking suspicion in the back of my head that I have just been whispered a great secret. Buy this CD, listen, get moved.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I love this movie. It is one of my favorites, I can't wait until the DVD comes out so I can see the Octupus part.  This is a great movie and everyone should own it.
B000059Z8J|4.0|I am so glad Superman is now on DVD!  It is one of my favorite features.  The special features on the DVD are very nice.  Christopher Reeve's screen test is finally shown, along with the other actors.  The three feature documentaries were all very interesting, particularly the explanation of what happened to Richard Donner after the first feature.  It shed a lot of light on what happened after the first movie.  It makes you wonder what would have happened to II if Donner had finished it.  <br />I also enjoyed the audio commentary by Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewics.  They provide interesting and funny commentary.  Mankiewics mentions that 70% of II was already finished by the time the first movie came out.  Also note the scene where Donner mentions a real good looking actor that Clark Kent is talking to. When he turns around, it's Donner himself.<br />My only problem with the DVD is the restoration of the previously cut scenes.  Why couldn't they give two versions of the film, one theatrical version and one special version (like the Terminator II and Independence Day)?  These scenes were cut for a reason and they are detrimental to the finished product when they are inserted back in.  The added scenes on Krypton don't amount to much.  Neither does the scene between Brando and Reeve on the Fortress of Solitude.   I also didn't care for the flashy scenes where Luthor tries to kill Superman with the machine guns, fire, and ice methods.  We are supposed to be entertained by how confident Lex Luthor is in his brains.  In the theatrical version, Superman lands in Luthor's hideaway, proceeds to the entrance, and tears down the door.  Luthor calmly sits in his chair waiting for him, poised because he knows he has outsmarted him with Kryptonite.   In this expanded edition, Luthor tries several methods to kill him.  Why does he have to do this when he already has the solution up his sleeve.<br />Still, this is a very entertaining DVD and worth buying.  I only wish they woulddo this with the 2nd one.
B00003CXRM|5.0|About two weeks ago, during a movie night, one of my flatmates suggested that we watch O Brother Where Art Thou?  Our other choice was Shaft, which we all wanted to see, Burke insisted we watch O Brother Where Art Thou.<br />We were all pleasantly surprised...although amazed might be a better word.  This movie, which roughly follows the Odysey (John Goodman as the Cyclops, the sirens and a possible Circe reference involving a frog are the only obvious parts) which is interesting.  Much better however is the wonderful camraderie between the various leads, especially George Clooney's fast quipped lines &quot;I'm they're pater familias&quot;<br />You never know for sure which way this movie is going it meanders like a walk on a warm summer day and that is a wonderful, wonderful thing.  In the end all of the various strands of story get tied nicely together.  It is an vibrant look at the Great Depression and is worth watching for the soundtrack alone, highly recommended.
B00005BL2A|2.0|people, this is a boring album, and yes, I love DM. They can do better than that....I don't like it when big time DM fans automatically give every DM release a full mark without distingusihing between the different albums. They are hardly all one one level. Okay, so some are better than others. This page is intended for you (the persons who know best about DM) to review albums to give people who are not so familiar with their work an idea about their albums and their music. I don't have a problem with the fact that you give an album (which in my opinion is weak) five points but please be a bit more precise in the future.  This is not supposed to be a meeting point for members of a DM fanclub.....
0380002930|5.0|When people ask me to describe &quot;Watership Down&quot; I inevitably say that it is a book about rabbits.  More than that I cannot say without waxing long (which I can do in a review).<br />Watership Down is a wonderful story on so many levels.  There is an exodus and harsh journey, the dream of a good home and good life, the philosophical question of safety and long life vs. an exciting life and so many other things.  The rabbits in this story are alien enough to be rabbits but the reader can still associate with them.  We care about Fiver, Bigwig and Hazel as they go through their lives, which are so different than ours but still make sense.  Their quest is for the same things that humans want - happiness.<br />This novel is fantastic because it takes us to a different view of our world.  It paints a portrait of animals weaving tales (the legends of El-Hariarah are one of the best parts of the novel).  The dialogue and description are both fast paced, as is the action.  Overall this is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read and will remain Richard Adams masterwork!<br />As an end note, I cannot recommend any of Richard Adams other novels.  Shardik was decent but the rest IMHO were endeavouring too much to make a point, haranguing on his own political crusade.
B00005AXEL|4.0|I have been a fan of Stevie Nicks for as long as I can remember.  I adore how she looks, how she dresses and the image she projects.  However, I must say that I am more of a fan of her music with Fleetwood Mac and not her solo material - her music with Fleetwood Mac was more &quot;witchy&quot; - songs like Rhiannon, Gold Dust Woman, Gypsy, Sisters of the Moon, Storms.....these are her truly, truly great songs that I never get tired of listening to.  I feel that her very best solo effort was The Other Side of the Mirror.  It has many excellent and listenable songs.  Favorite from that album include Rooms on Fire and Ooh my love (which is really a great song).  This new release, Trouble in Shangr-La, I feel is her next best solo effort, after The Other Side of the Mirror.  I am really not a fan of her earlier solo efforts - they had some good songs on them, like Stand Back, If Anyone Falls, Stop Dragging My Heart Around, Nightbird....and more that don't come to mind as I'm sitting here typing this at work and don't have her CDs in front of me! Her earlier efforts remind me too much of &quot;ballads&quot; and I'm not really fond of ballads.  This new album has three outstanding songs on it - Sorcerer (my favorite), Every Day and Planets of the Universe.  I just wish her solo songs were more dreamy and more witchy like when she was with Fleetwood Mac.  However, when anyone asks me who my favorite female singer is - it's ALWAYS Stevie Nicks.  She is my favorite, even if I'm not overly fond of some of her music.  I even wear a button with her picture on it on my coat every day and my license plate has a Steve Nicks song name on it!
B00005BL2A|2.0|After two post-Alan Wilder albums, it's clear that Depeche Mode has suffered at the loss of its sonic architect.  Wilder, who left Depeche Mode following &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; to focus on his successful solo effort, Recoil, had been the man responsible for Depeche Mode's sonic tapestry.  True, Martin Gore wrote the music, but it was Alan who took that music and turned it into Depeche Mode's signature sound.  &quot;Violator&quot; is perhaps one of his greatest efforts, closely followed by &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion.&quot;<br />Alan left, rightly so, for not getting the credit he deserved in Depeche Mode, and oh how that's evident now with the miserable &quot;Exciter.&quot;  This is coming from a long-time DM fan, stretching back to the mid 1980s, so it was very disappointing to me to give &quot;Exciter&quot; such a low rating.<br />The problem with &quot;Exciter,&quot; for me, is a lack of a coherent thread, a vital center, a musical tapestry that takes the listener from one song to the next.  &quot;Ultra,&quot; DM's first album with Wilder, is at least a better example of an album that flows well, musically as well as emotionally.<br />&quot;Exciter,&quot; on the other hand, seems to be a collection of material that wasn't quite fleshed out.  The songs flow from one to the other without really leaving an impact on the listener.  The songs, in fact, sound like outtakes from previous DM albums: &quot;Dream On&quot; is a great example of that, as the guitar rifts even sound like the same rifts used on &quot;Violator,&quot; in the musical interlude &quot;Crucified&quot; that plays right before &quot;Policy of Truth.&quot;  &quot;Breathe&quot; sounds like a Martin Gore solo effort.<br />On a positive note, David Gahan's singing is perhaps the best its been in the band's 20 years.  His experiences in drug addiction seem to have added an emotional urgency that was not present in previous albums.  Martin Gore's lyrics cover the same usual territory: religion, relationships, and some doom and gloom.  Ultimately, nothing new here.  He did a better job, lyrically, on &quot;Ultra.&quot;<br />If you can find the albums, the German band Wolfsheim is perhaps a better example of how Depeche Mode could have evolved.  Take a listen to &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; from &quot;Specators&quot; and see if you do not agree.religion, relationships, and some doom and gloom.  Ultimately, nothing new here.

6301640659|2.0|It is really bizarre watch one of the Corleones playing a leather daddy - but that's just what Pacino does (has he ever played any other part in all the films he's made?). But what is more bizarre is that this film was ever green lighted.  It is based on a book that had to have been better than the tripe here.  I've seen this movie several times; each time hoping that I will actually be able to figure out &quot;who done it&quot;. Friedkin, who is typically an excellent director, leaves the ending open for question (in my opinion) and as such confuses the viewer. I have read that Friedkin did this on purpose, but I don't know why.  When I want to watch a mystery film, I expect to have some resolution at the end.  This films doesn't provide me with that satisfaction.<br />Further, this is a VERY violent and repugnant film, depicting a small segment of the gay community, but the casual viewer isn't aware of that fact. It's a dark, depressing, and angry film that seems to not know what it wants to say or how to say it.
0486283577|4.0|I've been looking for a book with some illustrations of how women dressed in the 1800's. This book give its reader a number of illustrations and patterns where a crafty person, or a person with some seamstress knowledge, could create an outfit by enlarging the patterns and selecting materials that might have been used during those days. Takes a little doing, but can be done. Lots of puffy sleeved dresses and some beautiful coat patterns.
6305807086|2.0|People who want to be thought of as Clever Cling to this film like Magnets cling to Metal. Many Critics and Audiences saw the Title, Expected a Posturing Vanity Piece for Malkovich, Viewed the film and saw that it was something Completely Different, so they automatically assumed they Liked it, they really should Look Closer.<br />\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is a Childish, downright Silly film. The Directing is Amateurish, the Production is Shabby and the Performances are Sloppy. The Usually Brilliant John Cusack is too Over-the-Top to be Funny, his performance could have Saved the Film from being just a Clever Premise looking for a Script.. His Annoying Performance saves Nothing. Catherine Keener isn't much Better, come to think of it, neither is Cameron Diaz, whose casting is as Bizarre as the Storyline. These two Talented Actresses are Totally Miscast and Underused. Only Malkovich walks away without Egg all over his face, it's just a Shame he had to have his name in the Title.<br />There are a Few things here and there that held my Attention. The Cameos from Charlie Sheen and Sean Penn are Perfectly Timed and Hilariously Performed. It Shocks me how Director Spike Jonze could use these two Actors so Well in Cameos, but he didn't have the first Clue how to use Cusack, Keener and Diaz. Also, inside the mind of Malkovich and seeing the world through his eyes is Fun for a While, but it Quickly gets Tiresome. As does the Premise, the Performances and the Whole Overrated Mess of a Film.
B00003CWTH|1.0|I know I've given it one star, but only because I could not give it a negative 10.    .... It's just the \\"F\\" word strung together over and over for three plus hours. In fact, if you took out all the times the \\"F\\" word was spoken, then you'd have a twenty minute movie....    I ran out to see this picture immediately upon its release because I was so impressed with Anderson's Boogie Nights. Now, I use Magnolia as my rating for the worst film ever made....    After an hour into the film, I wanted to leave but was certain that it had to get better. After two hours, I felt I had vested too much time in it to leave. At over 3 hours I had to stay until the painstaking end and then I literally, screamed out, \\"I want those three hours of my life back!\\"    Just absolutely horrible!
B000002IWQ|5.0|This has to be Rush's best complete album they have ever done. Now granted some of their work from 1974-1981, was great, the albums only contained 7-8 songs, due to the epic proportions of PRog Rock. This album with more than 7 -8 songs, is complete. Kevin Shirley does an excellent job of getting a raw sound out of Rush. This also is is the most stripped down Rush album too. Alex Lifeson, was really getting into the Seattle grunge sound, and it shows on this album...<br />My only beef with this album is the song &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot;. This could have become Rush's first top 20 single, but the opening line alienated too many. As it comes off as a song about homosexuality from the opening lines, many of my friends quickly skipped this song, and many others would too. All this and without knowing that the song was pened about heroism, and the first part about a friend of Neil Peart's who was a homosexual and died of aids...Just a risky opening line to start off a song that could have become their biggest...<br />&quot;Between Sun And Moon&quot; is very &quot;Who&quot; and &quot;Cut to the chase&quot; is very Grunge-like. A very great mix of songs, and an excellent come back from the synthesizer days of the 1980's
B00004W5UA|1.0|Brad Pitt, as America's most underrated actor (could it be because he's looks the way he does?), does a wonderful turn as Tyler Durden in this purile film. And Bonham Carter, Norton, and Meatloaf are all good as well. (I don't know why Pitt got so excited about this project. I surely don't know why he would file his teeth down to perform in it.)<br />Come on, I'm a guy and I'm over thirty, and I couldn't bear to watch the screen the whole time - and it wasn't because it was scary - it was because it was GROSS! This is a gross out film. Watching it is like being forced to watch THE FACES OF DEATH over and over again - and liking it!<br />While Tyler wants to reach &quot;rock bottom&quot;, I don't think we need to see it in all it's detail.<br />The same moral and message was in The Portait of Dorian Grey and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but without the gross-out factor.<br />I went home and took a shower after seeing this film!

B00005B36H|5.0|I'm not gonna write a song-for-song review of this album...I don't need to. It definitely speaks for itself...Tool made this album as a completely seperate entity from their other albums...it only shows how Tool has progressed, grown, changed, and evolved into what has become one of the most simple, yet complicated...tranquil, yet chaotic, and diverse bands to ever grace the surface of this planet, and this review is my way of saying \\"thank you\\" to Tool for the experience, the influence, and the inspiration.
B00005AQGH|5.0|I know that I cannot be the first fan of this album. This is arguably one of the best CDs of the last decade. The prophetic messages established the West Coast style that everyone from Too Short to Yuk mouth to Ja Rule has employed since his untimely murder. The best tracks here are Hail Mary and White Man's World. All ... reviewers listen to the beats and if you ain't inspired, You ain't living, man.

Organized Noize may never get their props, but they are among hiphop's top 5 producers. Babylon and Wheels of Steel are my choices for the top jams on this joint.

0393317552|4.0|Guns, Germs and Steel studies human history with a geographical and biological approach that is both refreshing and informative. It answers some very important questions and provides an introduction to the phenomena of plant and animal domestication that (after reading it) seems essential to understanding human history.  I wish I'd read it in high school!  On the down side, the book is at times repetitive and has too few maps.
B00005B36H|5.0|&quot;Lateralus&quot; is possibly Tool's most ambitious work to date. It is an album thick with complexities and a myriad of instrumental voices. Each instrument tells its own tale on this album, the drumming laying down beats that range from deep and peaceful, to frenzied and disturbing. The bass is deep and resonant, and, as in many past Tool works, is often the chief rhythmic device - a fantastic one at that. The guitar is sonically visual, wailing and shifting in a deluge of different pitches that intertwine the bass. And of course there are the vocals - and if you've listened to Tool then you already know what I'm talking about. As always they are unearthly, haunting, and serenely beautiful, albeit at times powerfully savage. <br />&quot;Lateralus&quot; is the album that will have Tool fans salivating. The songs are long, and musically more complex than on previous Tool releases. People who loved &quot;Aenima&quot; for the &quot;Kick-arse riffs&quot; may find &quot;Lateralus&quot; a little difficult to get into. The tendency of most songs to break from pounding beginnings into slower, distorted mid-sections may put some people off. If you love the sonicscapes that Tool create however, than prepare for a musical orgasm. Also, the lyrics are not as developed as some of their previous efforts - which still means that they are far more grown up than 99% of bands out there (not to name any Korn names). Chances are, the people that are put off by the musical complexity in &quot;Lateralus&quot; are the same that like to discuss the deep sincerity and genuine emotion contained within Brittany Speares' work. Doubtless she has learned from life, and means everything she sings (NB. Previous statement is intended to be dripping with sarcasm). <br />If you care for music, or more importantly, care for heavy music that breaks typecasts and barriers with a complexity that cannot be matched anywhere, than buy &quot;Lateralus&quot; - You'd be a fool of you didn't.
B000056QE5|5.0|This is certainly one of the finest scores ever written or performed for a motion picture. Irwin Kostal arranged and conducted the music and what a glorious job he did. The Overture is especially exciting and beautiful. It really conveys the spirit and haunting beauty of Mary Poppins.<br />Julie Andrews and the casts' performances are tops on every song. This album contains so many favorites that are now classics. The finale song, &quot;Let's Go Fly a Kite&quot; is incredible. This soundtrack spent several weeks at number one on the Billboard chart when it was originally released. It is timeless and sounds better than ever now remastered on CD.
B000059Z8J|4.0|This edition of Superman is the way all DVD's should be made. It gives behind the scenes look at the making, footage never seen since the ABC broadcast and a beautiful picture and great sound. So why I'm I disappointed? Because Warner Bros stops at the first film. The release of the next 3 Superman films are a major disappointment. Part II was a great movie and could stand by itself, but there is about a half hour of film that was shot and has never been shown. Most Superman fans would love to see it, why is Warner holding back? Parts III &amp; IV in my opinion, while entertaining, not up to the level of excellence of the first 2 films and if Warner wants me to buy them, is going to have to pony up a lot more reason to buy them then just to have them on DVD. Most DVD owner's have huge Movie collections before they bought the new system. If the studios want us to buy rereleases of  older films, they have to justify the purchase, better picture quality isn't reason enough on this new format(most of the time). Part IV has huge gapping holes in it, and I'm not buying any but the first one until Warner get's its act together. While you wait for Warner to get smart, buy the Anchor Bay Version of &quot;Supergirl.&quot; Not perfect(the uncut version is in Mono, bad Anchor Bay) but a great step in the right direction.
0684800713|3.0|THE SUN ALSO RISES is about a group of expatriates who are living in Paris. They go to Spain together for a week long fextival to see the bull fights. This is the first book I have read by Hemingway and I got tired of his writing style. While the topics that he wrote about really interested me, I think that he could have gone deeper into his subjects than just describing everything that happened in such great detail. I talked to my English teacher and she said that Hemingway focused on making his writing perfect and he achieved this by including every detail to make the reader know exactly what was happening.            I really enjoyed the different characters in the novel, especially Brett. I also enjoyed seeing a relationship develop between Brett and the skilled bullfighter.
0375703764|2.0|Please bear with me for a bit of essential background. &quot;Redaction criticism&quot; is the study of the process by which compilers and producers select and use existing material from a variety of sources, give it a personal slant, and ultimately create an original statement (the phrase originated in the study of how the Christian Gospels came into being). This auteurial process lies at the heart of the post-modernist (&quot;po-mo&quot;) movement in the arts, whose central conceit is that you can make an original statement by nicking bits of earlier works according to your own agenda - while all the while maintaining an emotional distance from (or even taking the pee out of) the inspiration behind the works you are cannibalising.<br />This cold and ironic take on creativity is the inevitable result whenever people whose real gift is criticism dive into the medium and attempt to create subjective works of art. Critics of course know exactly what other critics will be looking for in a book/film/play, and they generally have the technical and analytical resources to produce workmanlike prose or action. The difficulty comes in finding a genuine subjective inspiration - an idea, a plot, a message - after perhaps years of pulling apart the work of others.<br />It was only a matter of time before somebody produced a redaction novel. Actually, given that &quot;House of Leaves&quot; has allegedly taken ten years to produce, it is surprising someone else has not beaten author Mark Danielewski into the shops. More to the point, now that the concept has effectively been test-marketed, it seems inevitable that someone else will come up with a perhaps more fully realised foray into this new genre. Inevitably, such books will represent a triumph of form over content. <br />The token plot in &quot;House of Leaves&quot; involves a psychologically damaged cameraman who sets out to make a fly-on-the-wall docusoap charting his dysfunctional family's acclimatisation to their new homein the country. To say that the house is haunted is to oversimplify the escalating temporal and spatial anomalies with which the house wrecks the lives of everyone who crosses its threshold. The Big Brother-style cameras in every room end up charting the family's fragmentation.<br />However, we are never party to a direct narration of the genuinely unsettling events in this storyline. Rather, we have an academic dissertation written by Zampano, a film critic, on the finished film - i.e. a film that has already been edited down from literally months of live action footage in service of the slant that the film-maker wants to put on events. More pointedly, not only is the film critic blind (!), but he has himself been fatally scarred by his obsession with the events portrayed in the film. Such narrative as exists is almost incidental to his analysis, and indeed we are led to believe that the film may not even exist - it may all be a figment of his paranoid imagination, an attempt to communicate the subjective experience of his own disorientation.<br />Even that is not the end, as the film critic's papers have been assembled and edited after his death by a literate but dissolute creature of the night tagged as &quot;Johnny Truant&quot;. This physically and emotionally scarred survivor is our only point of contact with either Zampano or the events in the eponymous House, and he is more concerned with giving us a disjointed and rambling autobiography of self-justification than he is with acting as a window on the unfolding narrative. His footnotes, often lengthier than the underlying prose to which they refer, are themselves the subject of further interpretive comment by the putative publisher.<br />Thus in order to follow the haunted house story (the story that should but doesn't altogether lie at the heart of the book), we have to strip away layer after layer (leaf after leaf?) of interpretation, reinterpretation and suspect motivation. Moreover, the text that is the vehicle for this excavation is more akin to a series of web pages than a traditional book: Odd fonts, odd spacing, sometimes less than a word to a page, overprinted, inverted, encrypted. The medium has literally become part of the message, while the style has become part of the medium.<br />Of the hundreds of footnotes, many provide information that is central to what passes for narrative, while others (particularly the many references to fictitious books and academic papers) are simply there to serve the core fiction that the book is itself a serious literary dissertation. So there is wit and erudition aplenty, in what will almost certainly be a template for more excursions into what we might call hyper-literature. The tale itself contains moments that are deeply unsettling, and for them wot is interested there is some biting satire on the mannerisms of academic and critical writing.<br />So Danielewski's book is probably tantamount to art, but is it entertainment? The answer is in my view a resounding no. &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is so in tune with the artistic zeitgeist that it probably had to be written. As to whether it has to be read (for any of the normal reasons for picking up a book, such as fun, insight or escapism), the jury is still out.
0385484518|5.0|I know Mitch Albom as a straight talking sports writer from the Detroit Free Press and ESPN's Sports Reporters.  Little did I suspect that the man can write a good story on any subject other than sports.  I come from the school of thought that only the true sport nuts with blinders on can write sports.  Albom certainly changed that viewpoint.<br />This story as many have noted, cuts deep into the psyche of anyone of a certain age where they are at a point in life where they can afford to look back on a portion of their life and contemplate.  Contemplate on the path not taken, on what might have been, on what was good in their lives, and on what they had but did not realize they had.  Albom talks about the impact and wisdom of his old professor Morrie and the battles he waged against the ravages of disease.  The key to this dialogue is the invariance of the lessons learned and the obviousness of it all.  the truth to life is and will always stare us right in the eye, whether we choose to pay heed to these lessons or to ignore it is up to us.  What Albom did is to pay heed, and he transformed these lessons into a dialogue that is not quite as involved as the Socratic dialogues, but the relative impacts are pretty similar.  He is able to point out life's lessons that we are all aware of but have rarely observed.  The wisdom of Morrie is not that he had these insights, but that he is able to put into words and synthesize the ideas to such a point that sinks in to our psyches in a conscious way.  Morrie points out some of the obvious, Albom makes us appreciate the view and more importantly, internalize the lessons.  The fact that the lesson was there all along is irrevelvant, waht is relevant is that the source of the synethesis, the voice of the book is about to fade away.  There comes an urgency in the book as Morrie moves to his inevitable destiny.  We feel alarmed, sad, and not a little guilty as we see Morrie moving past his last stages of life.  We feel like we are missing out on some great wisdom that is inperceptable unless it is through the mind of Morrie.  In actuality, wisdom that Morrie passes on is that the lessons have always been there, we just have to pay attention to the forest sometimes and let the trees go for awhile.<br />A very good book.re missing out on some great wisdom that is inperceptable unless it is through the mind of Morrie.

B000002ITW|4.0|The re-emergence of CSN&amp;Y (or perhaps YCS&amp;N would now describe the outfit more accurately) has provided as good a reason as any to look back at the supergroup's definitive live recording from the early '70's, &quot;4 Way Street&quot;. This was the double vinyl album of two halves - acoustic and electric - that gave the world un-plugged rock &amp; roll when Clapton still had long hair and MTV was no more than a twinkle in the over-arching firmament of potentiality. <br />&quot;4 Way Street&quot; was always irresistible, and, since the current release on CD has several additional tracks, a couple of less successful songs spoil the pudding even less than they did on the original release. Only close friends with egos locked in mortal combat could have produced a manifesto as tense but as intimate as &quot;4 Way Street&quot;. This rare combination - fierce rivalry crossed with artistic and emotional inter-dependence - comes across in several ways: Sarcastic/affectionate banter between numbers, impossibly perfect live harmonies often sung round a single mike, frantic duelling during the long improvised solos, and a collection of (with a couple of exceptions) superb examples of the singer-songwriter's craft.<br />Opinions will thus differ on whether this is really a group performance or a portfolio of solo numbers. The main competition for the spotlight is clearly between former Buffalo Springfield bandmates Stills and Young, and when they hit their respective strides the junior partners Crosby and Nash almost become an irrelevance. On the other hand, when David Crosby's superb voice is allowed to dominate, its raw-tender soulfulness carries material that might otherwise sound mediocre. Ex-Holly Graham Nash brings less to the party in the way of songwriting, but his tirelessly supportive vocal harmonising in support of stronger material from the three Americans helps bring home that this was (perhaps unlike some of the later reunions) a true band project.<br />Eventhe hippy-dippy asides about peace and love, and the snippets of political peevishness, help to make this album something special. They help document the potential of popular music to act as a unifying voice of conscience rather than just a badge of subcultural identity or a mere corporate product.<br />Ultimately however (and however time may have treated members of the band and their ideals) this album is about great music. Standout tracks naturally include all five of Neil Young's compositions, along with an extended jam around the CSN&amp;Y studio number &quot;Carry On&quot;. Most of the album's real highlights are on the acoustic numbers, but the rhythm section (comprising Johnny Barbata on drums and Calvin &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Samuels on bass) lays down a powerful groove on the electric sides. As with the four singer/guitarists, their key strength is an ability to share in the sensitive interaction that joins all six musicians into a tight but flexible ensemble. Even during the free soloing that fills over half of part II, the interest never slackens.
B000006YYM|4.0|Don't worry, you won't find the ramblings of Yes, the overblown melodrama of Genesis, the bombast of ELP here.  This is my favorite of the Gentle Giant albums I've heard--it doesn't have the excessively &quot;proggy&quot; sound of _Octopus_, or the &quot;too-clean&quot; feeling of _Free Hand_, and it's got a lot more juicy dissonance than _In A Glass House_.  The textures are highly contrapuntal and complex, and incredibly clean, because they're not smoothed over or sludged up by any attempt to sound &quot;symphonic.&quot;  It opens with &quot;Proclamation&quot;, possibly the best song I've heard from GG, which is a complicated, funky song with an 80's-sounding vocal line, and whose middle section contains some of the best stacked dissonant vocal chords this side of Thinking Plague's _In This Life_.  &quot;So Sincere&quot; is one of GG's most avant-sounding songs--it's polyrhythmic and incredibly frenetic.  &quot;Aspirations&quot; sounds like a jazzed-up English folk song, and provides a beautiful moment of rest after the first two hyperactive tracks, without ever getting &quot;too pretty.&quot;  &quot;Playing the Game&quot; is very jazz-inflected and reveals the Renaissance influence in its middle section, and it's followed by the amazing &quot;Cogs in Cogs&quot;, which includes a mind-blowing Stravinsky-like mobile involving two voices and two instruments playing and singing short ostinatos in four different time signatures at once.  &quot;No God's a Man&quot; might be the weakest track, with an annoyingly &quot;70's&quot; sound to the vocals, but it's certainly not bad.  &quot;The Face&quot; is more straightforward in structure than most of the album, but it's got an excellent guitar solo by Gary Green and lots of fun time-signature changes.  The album closes with the brilliant &quot;Valedictory&quot;, a reworking of &quot;Proclamation&quot; in a different tempo and rhythm and with different instrumentation, and when this song crashes into a sputter of rewindingtape just as a third batch of those big dissonant chords are about to come in, you don't feel like speaking for a while afterwards.  4.5 stars.
B00005B36H|5.0|When I buy albums, I go from track to track enjoying all the artist has to offer.  With the addition of Tool's new offering, Lateralus, I slid the nicely covered black cd into the player and just wondered what would come out of the speakers.  The speakers buzzed with the atmosphere that we have come to expect from the band.  The attitude of the band has matured and it shows.  What has come from this album is not jumping from track to track, but listening to how seemless the tracks flow into one another.  Sit back, enjoy the story that unfolds.
B00005J73X|5.0|After many, many years, and many, many performances, finally Bon Jovi has given the fans what they wanted. This live CD includes many of the band's biggest songs, as well as others that are not as well known. There are new songs, as well as old favorites and every one of the band's CDs is represented. From old favorties like &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; to &quot;It's My Life&quot; and &quot;Just Older,&quot; &quot;One Wild Night...&quot; covers everything that represents Bon Jovi. The remix of the song &quot;One Wild Night&quot; is hot and a great way to finish off this wonderful collection. The sound quality is terrific, and for those who have attended Bon Jovi concerts in the past will remember the energy and excitement of being there with this live CD. Finally....

0440219078|5.0|I thought the Giver was a great book. It has unique story. This is probably on of the best sci-fi books I have read. The book is about a boy named Jonas. Jonas lives in a &quot;perfect&quot; town. His town has no color, feelings or memories of snow, mountains, or anything like that. In the story Jonas gets picked to be a Reciever. He meets a man called the Giver. The Giver is a  man that holds all of the memories of color, feelings, etc. The Giver's job is to pass on the memories to Jonas. When Jonas finds out all of this new information, he wants to share it to the world. How will Jonas do it? You'll have to read.

B00005AFMT|5.0|If you already have the original version of Discipline, sell it and buy the remaster.  I thought I was familiar with every nuance of each musician's part of these songs...imagine my surprise when listening to the remaster that I was able to hear things I'd never heard before (especially with Levin's stick work).  <br />Many 'old' King Crimson fans refuse to accept Adrian Belew's role within the band.  I am of the opposite opinion -- I think their best work has been with Belew.  It is amazing to hear how well this album still holds up today -- 20 years after its original release.
0141802766|4.0|I'm a big fan of historical fiction and suspense so this book was a wonderful combination of both.  Set in 1958, in the height of the Spudnik anxiety, the reader gets a mix of early space program with D.C. area political intrigue.<br />Follett has assembled an interesting central cast - a group of friends from their days at Harvard (late 30's/early 40's) who went on to intrigue in WW2.  They're now in their late 30's and crossing paths as the countdown to the last hope for the American space program is due to launch.  Our protagonist, Luke, wakes up with amnesia and the story begins.  Along the way, he's able to look at old friends with fresh eyes.  An old flame comes to his rescue and well....<br />Wow, what a group of mixed opinions in these reviews.  All I can say that as a middle aged reader who hasn't seen all those Hitchcock movies, this was an entertaining read.  I listened to George Guidell's unabridged reading and found myself sitting in parking lots so I could just listen to a few more pages.  That doesn't happen all that often these days.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The album released after his death, almost as a sign of a resurrection, this cd has all of the makings of a rap superstar.  2Pac under a pseudonym (Makaveli) still knows how to do what he is great at.  This album should be charished by all music fans alike because it is one that everyone should have next to his released before his death called ALL EYEZ ON ME. R I P - 2PAC
0784010501|4.0|Madonna is a woman who has &quot;The nerve&quot;. She pushes buttons. Meaning-she will go beyond most people's wildest dreams, and make those thoughts real through her music and theatrical art on stage. Not only is she a excellent entertainer, but she also sends a message. Challenge yourself, look beneath the opinionated, and the controversial reputation that the media (Pitt-bulls)havecaused her. I dare you to view &quot;MADONNA'S TRUTH OR DARE&quot; with an open mind, and you will find a part of her within yourself.
6304712936|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 13 and was amazed that it could entertain a 13-year old!! Now that I'm older, I can enjoy some more of the subtle nuances of just the facial expressions alone...especially F. Murray Abraham! Out of this world.<br />Even today I'm still chilled by Mozart's opera that features the ghost of a long-dead warrior...a manifestation of Mozart's own guilt involving his own father. Also, I'm chilled by Salieri \\"working\\" feverishly with Mozart on REQUIEM--a must-have for your music collection, although unfinished as demonstrated in this movie.<br />A work of fiction? Perhaps. But believable...Salieri really was as untalented and bland as the movie makes him out to be! Try to listen to his music sometime and try not to fall asleep. Yikes!  Of course, this movie does point out that even in the 1700s all you had to was to have the ear of royalty whether you were good or not -- court politics certainly had a lot of play in Salieri's manipulations.<br />Set pieces are astounding, costumes are flamboyant and historic, and enjoy Austria. It's one story you'll never, ever forget.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have read some other reviews, and quite frankly im surprised that people that call themselves original Tool fans have not praised this album. True, it has a lot more odd-time signatures than Aenima, but it is by far their most musically intense cd yet. It may take a few listens to get used to the theme of the album, but once you've done that you'll be hooked. Dont miss out, it is worth the buy!
B00004RFFI|2.0|Do you want to see a plot repeat itself 3 times before coming to a conclusion the 4th time around?<br />See this movie.<br />And what saves it the 4th time around anyway?  An endearing old woman who gets hurt urges Helen Hunt to &quot;stop&quot; the madness that is the TORNADO.  While you're at it, Helen, stop the earthquakes, too.  Maybe you can throw some Pepsi cans in a crack and get some &quot;readings.&quot;  Okey-dokey.<br />If you're looking for a dynamic plot, forget it.  It just keeps twisting around, and around, and around...o[...]<br />Don't get me wrong.  It is a visual feast, but so improbable even if it does open up under the premise of &quot;the worst storm activity&quot; in who-knows-how-long.  It's still improbable all the same and our bad guy (Mr. Elwes himself of Princess Bride fame) is not so much a bad guy but an excuse to provide Bill Paxton &quot;motive.&quot;  If you can call it that.  Wrap that around a confused separated-but-rediscovering-love plot twist and you wind up with a cookbook Hollywood film bound to please Hollywood executives with $$$.<br />It's not bad.  Artistically, however, it also gives you nothing new.  So...5 stars for brainless action and thin plot...2 stars for a motion picture.
0783235607|5.0|I've been saying that word alot. It's not good to explain movies too much. Sometimes it's better to just to say one word or nothing at all. The piece of artwork in its self explains it all.
B000053V7Q|4.0|Despite that he never performed in Europe or Asia, in all, never outside the U.S.mainland besides Canada and Hawaii, Elvis was HUGE outside the USA. This documentary of Dennis Sanders, was a joke and boring when it was released in the early 70's. Dennis Sanders treated Elvis's generousity then with an attitude like:&quot;I'm the director, i make the film how i see fit&quot; result: a terrible film wich flopped. It's follow-up a year later &quot;On Tour&quot; was made by someone who wanted to show everybody what Elvis was all about,getting as a reward an Emmy/Oscar for best music-documentary in 1972! This 21st Century version is done by some-one who wanted to make a GREAT Show documentary of World's greatest entertainer. It shows! From the moment it opens with the small text and finishes with &quot;until now&quot; and then re-opens with Elvis doing &quot;mystery train/tigerman&quot;on stage,after that showing Elvis riding to the MGM re-hearsel studio's in his black Stuzhawk car accompanied by the CC-rider intro drumroll, until his stage performances of the Vegas Summer Elvis festival in 1970, You are focused to the screen. This is what the original 'That's the Way'should have been. Capturing an energetic and trim looking Elvis in action like some said: &quot;knocking them dead&quot; In all, if this would open in Theatres Worldwide, it might even top the Elvis Concert who tours the world at the moment with great succes.<br />Hopefully they have in plan a 21st Century version of &quot;On Tour&quot; in the making also. Let's hope so.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Come to think of it, why was the sound so low? 2.1 instead of 5.1 I guess, also, Metropolis Pt. 1 is missing, don't you think they would have put that on the DVD. Oh well, still good. To all those people who complain about widescreen, Some cameras, including the ones used to film this DVD are not the Panavision type like the ones used in movies. You can't just make something widescreen if it wasn't filmed in widescreen.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus takes approximately 5 complete listenings to fully appreciate. This delayed-gratification of its genius is certainly worth it. Its the non-standard time signatures that prevent instant addiction. I freaking love this album, but must say that comparing it to the earlier albums is absolutely pointless. Parabol and Parabola are absolutely ecstatic. I cannot  recommend this album enough. Let me also suggest TOOL fans cheeck out the Montreal-based group Godspeed you Black Emporor. Now that is some sonic genius as well.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This has got to be the best music DVD or video ever! Dream Theater is the best. I still can not believe the radio or MTV overlooks them. Instead we get boy bands and cRap, I mean Rap. You will not be disappointed. It covers the entire Metropolis Pt. 2 CD and has some extras from prior albums, including a 23 minute song, A Change Of Seasons. They play their long songs without mistakes and everyone stays in sync,(No Boy Band pun intended!) what power houses! The only bad thing is the hypnotist at the beginning seems to shout to compensate for the audience, kinda unrelaxing.(His very words are &quot;Close your eyes and begin to relax.&quot;) Also the actors playing in the story line are kinda lame, it's trying too hard to parllel the dialog and ends up really silly. Plus they don't look too 1920's as the album depicts them. Once you get past the first few minuts of double, mirror images and METROPOLIS/ tie dye screens superimpossed over the footage it gets really good. I'm glad I bought this.
B00003CXAE|5.0|John Travolta and Olivia Newton John share amazing on screen chemistry in this comedy/drama about two teenagers falling in love one summer night.  Travolta's struggle to overcome his ego and to impress his friends becomes less and less important as he begins to realize that Newton-John is the One That He Wants!  It is a classic love story meets ruthless comedy.  The music is fantastic.  Grease shall go down in history as one of the greatest musicals of all time!
0800132343|5.0|Das Boot is a taut, realistic drama, exemplified by a careful plot that maintains and releases tension incrementally so that we are riveted to the screen, and the two and a half hours the film runs seems like half an hour.  Director Wolfgang Petersen (lately the director of The Perfect Storm (2000)) persuades us to identify with the German sailors crammed into their Unterseeboot as the depth charges blast all around them.  Strange, take away the spoken German and this could be an American submarine dodging those depth charges.  In fact there is no German insignia on the U-boat, and you have to look hard to find a swastika anywhere in the movie.  Clearly Petersen wanted to disassociate himself and his movie from the Nazis, who had ruined Germany, and seek a universal identification for his crew.  The somewhat eerie effect on the American viewer is not only to make us see the human waste of war, but to lead us to realize that yes, it was horrible for the Germans.<br />Great movies surprise you.  Something creative happens and your eyes widen and your attention is arrested.  Here it begins when the U-boat's captain, played with superb subtlety and characteristic charm by J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, talks against &quot;our masters in Berlin&quot; as his men steal nervous glances at one another.  You know they're thinking, &quot;The captain is talking treason.&quot;  But suddenly we, the audience, realize that he knows he's going to die (probably going to die, I should say, since we are told in a blurb following the opening credits that of 40,000 Germans sailors sent out in U-boats, 30,000 did not return); and so he feels free to speak his mind.  And then to put an exclamation point on it, he tells the young journalist on board to write it up for the propaganda minister and then, as an ironic stab at the &quot;Hitler Youth&quot; officer, he orders &quot;It's a long way to Tipperary&quot; to be played on the Victrola, while they all sing along in glorious English!<br />One of the amazing things about this movie is how the U-boat and the destroyers seem to take on emotionally-charged characteristics.  When the destroyer appears in the periscope out of the fog and the spray, it seem like a monster about to descend.  And the way the depth charges are flung at the U-boat made me feel how much the Allies hated them and wanted to destroy them like vermin.  I felt sorry for the German sailors cowering in their little boat, being hated so much, because Petersen made us see that those men were no different than you and I.<br />This is not only one of the greatest war movies ever made, it compares favorably with the classic anti-war drama (also seen from a German POV), Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) directed by Lewis Milestone.  I suspect that Petersen was influenced by that movie and by some American films about World War II, in particular Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), Robert Wise's excellent submarine drama set in the Pacific starring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.mazing things about this movie is how the U-boat and the destroyers seem to take on emotionally-charged characteristics.

B000002TQV|5.0|Lets face it Pablo Honey wasn't anything special.  But a couple of years down the road and Radiohead made their first masterpiece.  The Bends is more guitar rock than it's sucsessors OK Computer and Kid A.  The album doesn't flow together like those 2 albums either, which is just fine in my book.  This allows for an album without any filler.  Well Planet Talex isn't that great but the rest of the album is magnificent. <br />Lyrically this may be Radiohead finest album.  Songs like Fake Plastic Trees, My Iron Lung, and Street Spirit are marvels in an age where cliche lyrics rule the mainstream.  The finer tracks on this album are High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, My Iron Lung, Street Spirit, and The Bends.  A true classic for ANY music fan.
0312979479|4.0|Did you know that the play had a different ending? A classic mystery. It was a bit too long to wait for all ten people to get killed before finding out who is the read murderer, so I skipped to the ending. Agatha's dream come true. A perfect murder case.
0385501560|4.0|Another excellent novel by an excellent author.  After reading 2 of the first 3 (haven't gotten to Survivor)  Palahniuk novels I was excited to read Choke.  What I found was the typical character in a typical Palahniuk novel.  Not that this a bad thing mind you.  As the story progresses you can see hints of Palahniuk's standout Fight Club strewn throughout from the macho attitudes of the main character to the down right lunacy of some of his behavior.  You can see hints of &quot;Joe&quot;from fight club and Shannon from Invisible monsters.  &quot;Joe&quot; is seen in the self help sexual addiction meetings and Shannon is seen in the self destroying behavior of choking onesself as she did with popping pills.  I'm sure Palahniuk is tired of the comparisons to Fight Club but they are inevitable and  well justified.  You can't write a novel like that without leaving the reader addicted to your literary style/genre.  Choke feeds this addiction well and leaves the reader wanting more of this author's fantastic works.
B00000J7J4|4.0|As one who grew up on Santana's first three albums, I didn't know what to expect from this entire compilation (except for the megahits Smooth and Maria Maria).<br />I was not disappointed.  I found myself cranking the volume up with the car windows down, driving down the road and moving the appropriate foot in rhythm.  Yes, this is NOT the &quot;Santana&quot; type of album we have come to expect, but it IS him on guitar!  Say what you will about his &quot;distinctive&quot; and &quot;recognizable&quot; way of playing, but he is still around and kicking and winning awards.  It is certainly an album you can play again and again.<br />While some of the other &quot;featured&quot; people may get your hackles up, this is the way of the music industry now.  You collaborate, you mix, you merge, you get top names, you sell albums.  That's just the way it is.  And if you find you get some hits off of it (that's the real reason, isn't it?), then that's icing on the cake.<br />This album is Santana's icing.  He deserves to be recognized and rewarded for his musical career and talent.  Good for him!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie's new album rocks. Her collaborations with Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, Macy Gray, and the lead singer of the Dixie Chicks make this CD great for any Lillith fans out there. Although among the songs there is not another &quot;Landslide&quot; or &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; they are all wonderful. Each listen to the album leaves one with a new favorite track on the CD. The lyrics are thoughtful, and the instrumentation is charmingly diverse. This one better get some Grammy nods...
0385501560|5.0|The only reason I found myself laughing while reading this book less than I did when I read Fight CLub was because of the fact that I read the majority of this book at work and didn't want my coworkers pestering me about what I was reading, because of the graphic sex. The chapter where Chuck first introduces us to the Colonial village was genuinely hilarious. The bathroom chapter concerning the meeting in room 234 was sick and twisted and just over the top. I really hate to say anymore because I don't want to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this. I hear Chuck's next book, Lullabye, is a more serious work. I'm sure he'll manage to inject enough of his observations to keep it from being a somber po-faced piece.
B0000029DD|5.0|I can't bring myself to review this album, because I'd go on forever and none of it would make sense. So let me just say this: it's worth its weight in gold. Every once in a while I get inspired to make a Jeff Buckley compilation tape to play in the car, but when I'm done making it, I end up giving the tape away to someone. That person ends up falling in love with the music. Every time. Jeff was gifted in ways we can only begin to imagine. When he was taken away from us, he'd only started. &quot;Grace&quot; was to be the first in a long succession of great albums. Now all we're left with are the countless live versions of the songs off this album, the Verlaine sessions and the handful of home-made demos Jeff made days before he died. If you do not have this album, you are missing out on something very special.
B0000048CX|5.0|But my best (and coolest) friends this summer were obsessed with Griselda (track 2) and sang it all the time - so I bought this cd, hoping to get back into the summer - and I really, really enjoyed it.  I am not really into folk (seriously, really, truly not) but one of my friends compared this to the Beatles (not really sure if I saw that, but still...) and I think that at moments they sound exactly like Belle and Sebastian (another group I absolutly adore, and know pretty well).  This album is made up solely of covers of other groups songs, other folk songs in particular, and there are some slow moments (and songs I personally don't adore - like &quot;Emulsified&quot; - don't remember the track), but others - like Griselda, and a few more, are poignant and really cool.  I think this cd is great.
B00005B36H|5.0|With a wait of five years, during which Tool fans have no doubt been salivating, it might be expected that a follow-up to the highly complimented Aenima would be a let down.  This band's heavily anticipated reappearance is far from a disappointment.  With a more mature pace and significantly greater complexity Lateralus preserves the patented Tool guitar, bass, and percussion energy while adding an eastern flavor to the strings and vocals (particularly on the cut &quot;Triad&quot;).  Dedicated Tool fans will be much more than impressed, to say the least.  New Tool fans should arrive by the score. . . .so buy those concert tickets early!
0440539811|5.0|How do i feel about it?  I've read this book probably an average of once a year for the last twenty years.  Reading it helps clear my mind of all the nonsense the world pushes into it... believe me, i watch President Bush on tv, and i see the fnords on his teleprompter.  I consider this book an important part of my overall mental health and worth as a human being.  <br />What will it do to you?  Love it or hate it, you'll never think the same way again.  It will screw with your mind, big-time.  I read one review here by someone who hated it... he hated it so much that he actually destroyed the book, the first time he'd ever done that in his life.  It MOVED him!  I think any book that can inspire that sort of passion, for or against it, is worth reading at least once.  Maybe a few dozen more times.

B00003CXE6|4.0|The worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against 10 or so other gladiators and slice them all down (or to pieces) one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire - would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant/slave trader. High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.
B00005B36H|4.0|Well this is what youre getting. This CD is tight. Its more like one long song. Maybe 2. Its hypnotic. Youll find yourself listening to it at all times. You will find yourself talking about this cd at all times. Youll find that its a lot like their second cd. Youll make a mix tape with the best of their last 4 releases and youll be happy.
B00005B36H|5.0|After 5 years without an album from Tool,does Lateralus make up for that wait? Sure A Perfect Circle helped tide me over..but 5 years? But the answer to the question is yes Tool has done it. Lateralus is by far one of the best albums to come out in out in a real long time,and a long one to. The tracks that are acualy songs last from 4:35 min to 11 min. the c.d. with a total length of 79 min. With the single Schism out,hopefully most can at least hear how great that song is if they don't already have the c.d.,but even with such a great single there is better tracks like Parabola,or Ticks and Leeches. But the only thing that realy depletes from the value at all is the non-song tracks like Eon Blue Apocalypse. So this is a great c.d. worth the wait and teh 15 dollars it will cost you so go and buy it.

I remember the first time I heard my voice on a recording.  It was the most beautiful sound I ever heard, and I cried tears of joy.  &quot;I am great.&quot; I thought to myself &quot;I am Celine Dion, the greatest singer ever.  My name will be synonomous with heaven.&quot;  Buy this album, you will understand it more clearly.
0060392886|5.0|The Dirt is a furious and vicious rollercoaster ride into the lurid, depraved and deliciously exciting world of Motley Crue. Like any good rollercoaster, this book will can make you cry, laugh and may even turn your stomach a little. And when you've gotten off and have caught your breath, you suddenly find yourself where you started, back on page one, ready for another ride.  This book is so well-written it feels more like real-time than reading an autobiography...I guess that explains why I couldn't put it down: on some primative level I know I shouldn't acnowledge, I was afraid I'd miss something. You'll learn all kinds of things you didn't know, things you've always wondered about will be explained, and things you never thought humanly possible will be elaborated upon with titillating detail, as recalled by the 4 original members of the band  In short, if you're a Motley Crue fan, you'll love this book. If you hate Motley Crue, you'll love this book. And if you have no idea who Motley Crue is...well, you really NEED this book! Enjoy it, Respectfully, CAT
0440416027|5.0|David Almond provides much food for thought in his debut novel Skellig. Issues of change, death, boy-girl friendships, the nature of learning, and faith are all explored and then some.<br />In addition, this novel requires some &quot;research,&quot; if the full meaning of Almond's symbolism is to be understood. It is a great novel both for showing kids the stresses in life (sick little sister, drifting apart from friends), as well as teaching them about literary techniques (forshadowing, symbolism).
B000002AP1|5.0|As Iggy says, \\"the proof is in the pudding.  It's a very violent mix.\\"  This is red-lined, bone-scraping rock n' roll ... the kind that, no matter how low you turn the volume knob, just seems to get louder, and louder, and louder.  It's an assault on good taste, on music, on conformity, and on all your childish, safe ideas of what a recording and a \\"rock star\\" should sound like.  <br />This is Iggy.  He means it, every ugly bit of it.  Does that bother you?  Then go buy Wings' Greatest Hits or something -- because that's what you are really looking for.  The rest of you hit the \\"buy\\" button now, and don't thank me -- thank Iggy.
B00005BL2A|4.0|The first time I listened to this album it struck me as dull and monotonous.  However, the more I listen to it, the more I love its nuances and subtle melodies and lyrics.  The same phenomenon happened to me when I first bought &quot;Ultra&quot; also.  It took a few months before I really got to appreciate that album because it was not, for the most part, catchy or immediately appealing.  DM's greatest asset is their way to grow slowly on you, so that your favorite songs end up being the ones you originally skipped over.  Exciter is sizing up to be another DM great.
B000006XQJ|4.0|This probably isn't actually good music, but I am shamelessly fond of it.<br />The 12&quot; mix of &quot;Don't Leave Me This Way&quot; is one of the all-time great dance tracks.<br />If you were drinking at a college bar in the mid-to-late 80's, you know what I am saying.  After the A-Ha, but before &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Lights,&quot; and sometime around &quot;I Melt With You,&quot; this was the time/song of the evening that you were finally drunk enough to start dancing to.<br />The rest of this album is just fine...but who cares?
B00005B1EX|5.0|Like a fine wine, some things get better with age, and one listen to Rob Halford's vocals on this double disc prooves this adage to be true! He's never sounded better in my opinion. But its not just that factor that make this cd such a diamond. Halford has carefully chosen his material to wrap his tonsils around and has avoided the pitfall of making this a Priest greatest hits package. Boasting seven glorious tracks from the Resurrection opus, several Fight gems and a varied selection of magestic Priest oldies (one or two real oldies and mostly non obvious selections) the variety of it all surely pays homage to how talented the Metal God is. The track listing makes this more a celebration of 30 years of metal mayhem than giving an impression of staged nostalgia. Of note are the three studio tracks which include one newie being in the form of &quot;Screaming In the Dark&quot; which is kinda &quot;Painkiller&quot; like, &quot;Heart Of A Lion&quot; salvaged from the &quot;Turbo&quot; era me thinks and &quot;Prisoner of Your Eyes&quot; a mega power ballad. The most complete opus with the Halford brandmark since &quot;Metal Works&quot; hands down!

Unfortunately it seems that these poor quality videos are the only release of TP currently available, which is really too bad.
B00002E285|4.0|Especially for those who own the album &quot;The Wall&quot;; the movie is a Floydian necessity.  The music of &quot;The Wall&quot; tells a story that may not be fully understood by listening to the album alone.  It may be necessary to also see the movie to get the full picture of what songwriter Roger Waters was trying to get across.  I recommend that you see the movie.  Sometimes you might have to see it more than once.  In order to fully grasp, I recommend that you buy the movie and watch it whenever you are in the mood.  Its meaning can change every so often and the experience is amazing.

0060977264|5.0|By the River Piedra I Sat Down &amp; Wept is a book that made me reflect and analyze the relationship between two people who want to seek their dreams, which have always been that of true love forever. I learned that differences and similarities are important in a relationship. Presumably, without these things life will be monotonous and without sense. Obviously, similarities are beneficial in a relatioship. They provide the connection of two people. Also, create a challenge between them because they believe that they are competing. On the other hand, differences make a relationship  difficult, because sometimes the way people do things is not how we like them done. In conclusion, the importance of life teaches us to understand and accept the mistakes that our partner has. It helps us to love and respect him or her like person because in this world nobody is perfect. I recomend this book to people who have interest to read a real love story.
B000022TT4|5.0|First and foremost this DVD provides an excellent Dolby Digital rendition of many of U2's greatest songs of the 80's.  Excellent concert footage is complimented with documentary footage both on and off the stage during their triumphant Joshua Tree tour.
B000059R8Y|5.0|I've heard that after this, Clapton is retiring. All I can say to him is: you've gone out the right way. This complete talent of Clapton's is an achievement in the greatest. Although I'm a great Clapton fan, I will have to admit, he has done some dodgey music, but this aint dodgey. I would call this an ultimate feat. I see Clapton next to the stars for this classic album. Clapton opens and closes with two excellent instrumentles, with an excellent jazzy open of the great title track 'Reptile' and the song about his Uncle and Wife, 'Son and Sylvia' in which he almost makes his guitar sing the words itself. Back in Clapton's home town, to call someone a 'Reptile' was a great respect, and the beautiful music portrays the tile perfectly. It sets the idea of a Reptile definitively in anybody's mind, showing the true talents of Clapton. After his excellent work with B.B.King, another of my favourites, this CD shows the truth in Clapton's heart. I've heard people say that drugs make musicians better with the example of the great Jimi Hendrix by the statement, but all I can say is look at Clapton now. He has brought excellent music of a greater stansard and quality than his before, introducing an outstanding, almost perfect style to the music world. Eric Clapton is not only a great musician, but a great man. He has recently sold his guitar (and what a beautiful guitar it is) quite simply to fund his drug rehabitation unit. Although it was a great tragedy that his son died, it has benifited the music world greatly with Clapton bringing us many excellent songs of a higher quality and also bringing us this excellent CD which I'm sure he wouldn't have made if he were still on drugs.  I send a tribute out to Eric Clapton on this CD and many many others, and wish to thank him for introducing me to what I would phrase as 'revolutionary music' and also for keeping me away from the awful culture of modern day music. I don't know how one man can give the world such great listening pleasures, and just hope that his new child can follow on from him for it would be an excellent respect for the next generation to have another Clapton.
B00005B36H|5.0|Great album much better than Aenima.... but never better than undertow... this album is definetly one of the best albums I have ever heard the.... flow is wonderful... melodic and hard grabs you by the balls but still makes you stop and appreciate the emotion of it all
0425170349|5.0|One of the best books on the planet, Rainbow Six is action packed. This is one of Clancy's Best novels yet!
B00005B36H|5.0|It's almost scary to hear how balanced this production is. I feel that Tool has mastered this art of balance more than anybody else. This is clearly an album where you can tell that ALL FOUR members wrote these songs together as a group. Instead of something which has overly impressive guitar work or vocal or drums, etc, everything just comes together so perfectly to create this singular experience. The writing on percussion, bass, guitar, and vocals is equally as genius as the effort to play such written parts. This is the clearest on Lateralus and compared to previous works everything has come together better than it ever has. One of the best parts of Lateralus is that it can be dissected into its individual songs but if you play the album straight through, it can be felt (while hard to swallow in this form) as an entire experience. I feel that this is something that just makes these guys that much more original. They are so good at what they do that all imitators are simply just laughed away and cannot even come close to something such as this with the same attitude and professionalism as Tool. Nobody can imiate the jarring feeling of these four masters bringing thier talents together in moments of intensity or the way they combine to create the harbingers in between. The most impressive section I feel is the Parabol/Parabola area. Reading some reviews, a great deal of people agree. Something slow mideastern and exotic showcases the impressive and beautiful efforts of everbody in the group but when the tensions rise into Parabola the experience is just surreal. You'll simply get goosebumps the first time you hear it (and several times afterwards). Tool has definately made the wait worthwhile and fails to dissapoint. Led Zeppelin combined four great masters together just like Tool but I feel that this particular release has proven that these four artists in one room produces a sound which could never be created by any other combination of people writing and performing music. That alone just points out how fortunate we all are to be alive in the age of Tool. This kind of production has raised the bar immensely and will go to influence people for years and years to come.
0688145078|5.0|This book is a great gift for the older sibling!  The story and illustrations are very charming.   I purchased this as a gift for my 3 year old cousin and he enjoyed viewing the photos and relating to his new role as &quot;big brother&quot;!  I'd highly recommend this book...
B000002UB6|5.0|I know it's gotten a bad rap, but I'm only 14 and I think Let It Be is great.  It's live, but it sounds like John, Paul, George, and Ringo just sat down and jammed.  They seem to be having a pretty good time, but we know now that they weren't.<br />Two Of Us is good, nothing special, but it is the Beatles.  Dig A Pony has a nice beat to it.  The real gem is Across The Universe.  John has a great vocal, but it's been &quot;Specterized&quot; a bit too much.  I only wish George Martin had produced it.  I Me Mine is George's song.  It's really good, nice guitar, good drums.  Dig It....I think the best part is John's rambling about the FBI, the CIA, the BBC and the other things he talks about.  It's pretty funny.  I don't think it's a throwaway.  Let It Be is a great Paul song, the album version is a little different than the single, however.  Dig A Pony gives it a nice intro.  Maggie Mae is one of the so-called throwaways.  Maybe it's not up to par with other Beatles songs, but I like it.  I've Got A Feeling is a good rocker.  Interesting lyrics.  One after 909 sounds a little like country, but I like it.  The Long and Winding Road is average, but it's wonderful on Anthology. For You Blue is great.  Get Back.....yes, they passed the audition.<br />The Beatles are the best, every generation knows it.

B00005B36H|5.0|From the opening of the brilliant 8 min epic &quot;The Grudge&quot;, to the end of this disc, this disk will blow your mind.  The band has taken it's sound to new heights, with more experimentation than ever.  It lacks a solid radio hit, unlike it's prodecessors, even the first single, &quot;Schism&quot;, which comes the closest, has wild progressive antipop rythyms.  However, this effort wasn't aiming for that, and it shows.  The only other band out there that experiments to this degree of musical plateau is Radiohead, and possibly Pearl Jam.  Maynard James Keenan's voice is as angry and suspenseful as ever, even improved maybe.  The rest of the band has obviously proven themselves as well, with awe-inspiring cuts like &quot;Disposition&quot;, and the title cut.  If you want a song with a serious hard edge, &quot;Parabola&quot; fills the void.  The 5 year wait is over, and Tool is more powerful than ever.  Pick this up right away!

0688152023|5.0|... but this book really changed my workouts.  While there have been excellent books out there on cardio vascular fitness, sports nutrition, and bodybuilding, there's nothing quite like this (not even Jane Fonda's Yoga) that completes the overall picture with stretches.  Not just ye old pull, tear and hold stretches... but odd contortionist moves that unlock your joins and ligaments beyond the major muscle groups normally isolated in stretching.  Do the ones for the spine and you'll know what I mean.<br />From 15 min with this book in the store, energy is up (less sleep), coordination is up (precision exercises), and satisfaction is through the roof.  I'm buying it.<br />Hope it does the same for you!
0385501560|5.0|This may prove to be Palahniuk's breakthrough novel, following as it does the success of the film Fight Club. Critics of the movie may cite the shortage of character development and seemingly superficial responses to the complex and compelling problems of the contemporary American male. But no one can say that Victor Mancini, Palahniuk's newest protagonist, is not a nuanced and well-drawn young man. A sex addicted med school dropout with a pencant for pretending to choke on food at restaurants to solicit the help (and, eventually, the money) of his fellow restauranteurs, Mancini's mother seems to hold a dark secret about his identity. Unfortunately, she's dying of Alzheimer's. Meanwhile, Victor and his best friend work in a Colonial Williamsburgesque seventeenth century Living Hell. This is probably Palahniuk's funniest novel to date, and also his saddest. It's this accomplishment, mixing the depressing monotony of middle-class suburban life with the hilariously tragic ways we try to escape our existential crises, that makes this novel stand out from the library of absurd, sardonic American fiction. (see also: Tom Robbins) The prose itself shows more literary marksmanship than even Palahniuk's popular Invisible Monsters, and Victor's imprecise grasp of the language (Choke is largely a first person narrative) is wonderfully evocative of a 20something finding his way. Again and again, he can't find the exact word for a feeling, and settles for &quot;the first word that comes to mind.&quot; Brilliant isn't the right word for Choke, but it's the first word that comes to mind.
0800141385|5.0|Barbra Streisand reprised her role from Broadway to Hollywood as the legendary comedian Fanny Bryce (1891-1951) in Julie Styne's masterpiece \\"Funny Girl\\".  The stage production debuted on Broadway in 1964, and was nominated for 8 Tony Awards thereafter (including Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Musical).  So when the production was adapted from stage to screen, Streisand kept her role as Bryce and Omar Sharif played leading man, Nick Arnstein.  What is striking, and makes \\"Funny Girl\\" truly unique, is the fact that a movie musical can be greatly comical, yet dramatic at the same time.  The film's focus is on the turbulent, on/off romance between Bryce and Arnstein and it's bitter end.  The story begins with Fanny looking back at her humble beginnings in a small Jewish community.  She was a girl who didn't possess the beauty required of Ziegfeld-caliber showgirls, but she did have an amazing vocal range (no acting required by Streisand).  Along the way to stardom, Fanny discovers her inability to `play it straight', and her ability to make the audience laugh because of this quality.  But soon, the joke's on her in the end when she realizes that she has been using her comedy as a way to shut out her troubles and not confront her problems.  Throughout the film, Streisand delivers consistently in the acting department (hence, the Academy Award for Best Actress).  And much of composer, Julie Styne's, original score remained intact in the film.  Most of these songs have become the show tunes we all know and love, like \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\", \\"Second Hand Rose\\", and \\"People\\" (the latter of which became Streisand's first #1 hit on the Billboard charts).  In addition, two new songs were added and became as equally popular as some of the aforementioned numbers.  The title song was penned into the film along with the poignant closing number, \\"My Man\\".  All in all, `Funny Girl' has been a fondly remembered and brilliant film featuring (arguably) the greatest female performer of the 20th century.  The accolades are a mute testimony to the film's true greatness.  In the spring following its release, `Funny Girl' garnered 8 Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Score, Best Music, Best Supporting Actress (Kay Medford), Best Actress (Barbra Streisand), and Best Picture.  In addition, it picked up 3 Golden Globe nominations for Best Director (William Wyler), Best Actress (Barbra Streisand), and Best Original Song.  This is perhaps the only movie musical that intergrades all elements of the performing arts (comedy, drama, music, etc.) without losing sight of its permeating concept.
0553108034|5.0|This genre is full of derivative stuff but this is a beauty.  While that storyline has some cliche elements, the story  and characterizations are carried off exceptionally well.  The characters will stay with you a long time and the whole thing is far more evocative and compelling the other books of this type, even good ones like those by Robert Jordan.
015626224X|4.0|Who'd have thought an author of such distinction would have spent a portion of his life in such abject poverty--and then turned the episode into such a fine little book?<br />This is a more direct explanation of Orwell's thoughts on class and economics than anything to be found in his fiction.
B000006OAM|5.0|This album is definitely a keeper.  Devoted Natalie Merchant fans will especially enjoy it. Ophelia is darker than both Tigerlily and Motherland; Ophelia's musical ambiance is sullen, and the lyrics are often more morose. <br />Take, for instance, words from &quot;The Living,&quot; where Merchant sings that she does not &quot;care to stay with the living.&quot; Or &quot;My Skin,&quot; when Merchant laments, &quot;I've been treated so wrong, I've been treated so long, as if I'm becoming untouchable.&quot; <br />In my opinion, however, Ophelia is evidence of Natalie Merchant's continued growth as an artist. The album is not immediately accessible, but it is worth sustained listening because the tracks become more appealing over time. All songs are well written and well performed, in typical Natalie Merchant style. <br />I must also note that despite the five-star rating, I do not like this album as much as Tigerlily, which happens to be one of my all-time favorite discs.  Natalie's third solo album, Motherland, is also a fine effort and is lighter than Ophelia.  That said about her other solo albums, Ophelia is great music, and I especially recommend it to the Natalie Merchant fans out there.
B000002513|3.0|The jazzy Bruce of GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK sounds like he listened to a lot of Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire while making THE WILD THE INNOCENT AND THE E STREET SHUFFLE.<br />Much of the earlier jazz coloring is gone, replaced by an odd attempt at a funkier sound.  Jazz and Funk are only the tints on these early Springsteen records, though--beneath it all you can hear, in retrospect anyway, a rocker struggling to break free.<br />You can also hear, under all the layers of studio clutter Mike Appel insisted on dumping onto this record, a great songwriter coming to the fore.  &quot;4th Of July Asbury Park,&quot; &quot;Incident On 57th Street,&quot; and &quot;New York City Serenade&quot; are mulit-layered epics, maybe too obviously derivative (Dylan &amp; Tom Waits), but still little masterpieces on their own.<br />And, as with GREETINGS' &quot;Spirit In The Night,&quot; was it ever really a party without at least one late-night rendition of &quot;Rosalita&quot;?  Springsteen has said the band through everything into that tune, everything but the kitchen sink.  I'm glad they did, it's great, great fun.
0380002930|5.0|I have been reading the reviews on Amazon.com for this book, and decided that I should put my 2 cents in. The first thing that is so utterly captivating about this novel, is that although the main characters are rabbits, they become much more than that as you get into the story. Some people have claimed that this novel is full of weak characters and nothing put descriptions of the texture of plants. However, is a rabbit that strategically plans a complicated battle against a heavily secured rabbit society considered weak? I can't imagine someone claiming that the characters in this book are not full of depth and character. The wonderful thing about Richard Adams is that he creates an entire world for you, but it is more than that, he makes it believable. The rabbits in this book have complicated societies. Each rabbit warren has a different political system. The rabbits also have muths, legends, and heroes. People have also complained that Mr. Adams should have done this book with humans, but that would have wreaked it. Rabbits are a fresh realm, if Mr. Adams used the human realm we would have far too many preconceived ideas about the way that things should be. However, when you look at the world of the rabbits, you can incorporate many of the aspects of our world and view them from a totally different perspective. It is my personal opinion that anybody who says they &quot;hate&quot; this book is simply someone who doesn't appreciate fine, intricately designed literature. I hope that one day, these people will realize that there is more to literature than non-stop action with no details. Literature is a web of plots and sub-plots mixed with an array of character build up that makes a novel that can't be put down.<br />In short, I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who loves or likes to read. With that final note, I bid you farewell.
B0000024ZT|3.0|GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK presents the jazzy, poetic, early-version Springsteen, searching for his own sound.<br />The problem with the first few Springsteen records, not resolved until 1975's BORN TO RUN, was an inability to recreate the band's legendary live shows on vinyl.  &quot;Growin' Up&quot; is good here, it was downright riotous live, as various bootlegs and the version on the E-Street Band Live box set atest.  <br />But, despite some questionable production decisions and the inclusion of some occasionally pretentious clunkers, the early records are awash in great tunes.  &quot;Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?&quot; is an amazing thing; &quot;For You&quot; a lament to a wacked lover; &quot;Growin' Up&quot; and &quot;It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City&quot; chest-puffing declarations of independence, and--well, who hasn't driven too far in the middle of the night, singing along to &quot;Spirit In The Night,&quot; the sister-piece to &quot;Rosalita&quot;?
B00000J7SO|5.0|I've been avoiding buying &quot;Street Legal&quot; for years because everything I have ever read about it focuses on its terribly muddy sound.  That may well have been true (I never heard the original release) but I recently purchased this remastered version and the sound is great!  Beyond that, the songs are truly among Dylan's most melodic best and sung with incredible fervor.  If you are a Dylan fan you've heard this from countless people: &quot;I'm sure Dylan is a good song writer but he just can't sing!&quot;  Ok, we Dylan fans know that's not true but next time it happens just pull out &quot;Street Legal&quot; to prove that he can too sing by anyone's standards.  Many of these songs are a tour-de-force of Dylan's absolutely unique and ingenious way of phrasing.  He rhymes lines with the middle of some words, cramming the rest of the line into a space only he could find within the beat.  The backing on this album is also exceptional.  It's a big band with horns and backup singers in the tradition of Joe Cocker tunes like &quot;Feeling Alright.&quot;  They play with incredible intensity.  The lyrics are sometimes bewildering. The songs are seldom linear stories but more like collections of imagery. This works for me because you always hear something new depending on the mood you're in.  There's also a lot of psydo-religious imagery packed in there. I wonder why this isn't considered the first of his &quot;born again&quot; phase after hearing it.  It doesn't get preachy, though, more like a level of mysticism, and unfocused at that.  To summarize, I love this CD and it's been living in my CD player for weeks now.
B000003TAW|3.0|Think how great this album would have been if someone had bothered to produce it.  <br />With the exception of &quot;Undone&quot; and &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; most of these fine songs sound like they were recorded with a single microphone.  It's just a dull roar, with the vocals completely lost in the mix and the drums barely audible.<br />That said, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is an amazing song, an homage to nerdiness which--I can't believe I'm saying this--resulted in a great video.  Ralph and Pottsy's reaction to the guitar break is classic.

B00000255F|5.0|One of the most hyped albums of all time, and one of the very, very few to live up to it's advanced billing, BORN TO RUN marks the moment that Springsteen and the E-Street Band leapt from cult-status to a national phenomenon.  25 years later the album sounds as fresh and energetic as it did in the summer of '75.<br />The album is an odd amalgam of bravado, vulnerability, mashismo and romance.  There is such determination and desperation in Springsteen's characters on this LP: working all day, driving all night, teetering on the edge of some trap that they can't quite see but they can sure feel, all they talk about is getting out: &quot;It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win.&quot;<br />The whole LP is about those years when you're getting old enough to set off on your life, but still feel all those adolescent fears and pangs. You're trying to set up the future while settling with the past--and what of the past can make it through with you to the future?  What lives? What dies? The passion and pain in &quot;Backstreets&quot; is the most searing moment of Springsteen's early years: &quot;Blame it on the lies that killed us, blame it on the truth that ran us down--you can blame it all on me Terri, it don't matter to me now...I hated him.  And I hated you when you went away.&quot;<br />Springsteen has said he wanted to make an album that sounded like Phil Spector produced Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan-penned tunes.  In the process he created a sound of his own, all leather and heat and sweat, that a whole host of acts tried to recreate throughout the late '70s and '80s.  None of them ever matched the mark set by BORN TO RUN.<br />One thing I've always wondered...on the cover, how did the diminuative Springsteen get in a position to be leaning onto Clarence Clemens shoulder?
078062999X|5.0|I went to see this 4 hour movie in the theater, twice in one week. I was amazed at how it was filmed. Most versions of Hamlet are overwhelmingly dark and drab. Branagh shows us the highs and lows, the opulence and the horror that filled Hamlet's days and nights. The contrast adds a visual complexity - puts you in an emotional rollercoaster, drawing you into Hamlet's world. And such a stunning atmosphere is completely lost on tape. It was obviously an important factor in making the film, or Branagh would not have chosen 70mm. So here I wait, patiently (or not), for the DVD version to come out....
B000001EYW|4.0|\\"Still Waters\\" closed out the Century as the Bee Gees last studio album.  Featuring the big hit \\"Alone\\"; cuts \\"I Surrender\\", \\"Still Waters Run Deep\\" and \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\" could all have been big hits.  \\"Irresistible Force\\"  brings the famous trio in to a round-robin vocal that is truly unique.  \\"My Lovers Prayer\\", \\"I Could Not Love You More\\" and \\"I Will\\" harken back to the power ballads the guys are so famous for.  \\"Closer Than Close\\" and \\"Miracles Happen\\" seem out of step with the rest of the CD, but, hey, it's all good stuff.<br /><br />Last Note:  If you can find the CD single or IMPORT CD with \\"Rings Around The Moon\\" and \\"Love Never Dies\\" you are in for a real treat.
B000005Z0G|4.0|This was the first album that I bought of 2 Pac's and needless to say I wasn't disapointed at all. I remember the first time I saw &quot;I get around&quot; on MTV.  I was stunned at first that someone could come from where he had and survived to make a name for himself.  I bought the CD at first for &quot;I get around&quot; and &quot;Keep ya head up&quot; but as soon as I heard &quot;Holla if ya hear me&quot;, I was HOOKED from his awesome portrait of what the hood looked like from the inside.  <br />I was as sadened as most to hear that 2 Pac had been gunned down and his voice had been silenced.  Thank God, he had so many tracks already laid down that he could come out with so many albums after his murder.  It's like he's still among us chantin' &quot;Thug til ya die&quot;.  <br />For someone that is just jumping on the 2 Pac bandwagon, Strictly 4 my N.I.G.G.A.Z. is a must have.
B000003N7R|5.0|Perhaps one expects the meeting of two musical geniuses to produce extraordinary fireworks and is disappointed when the results are merely wonderful as in this recording.<br />Coltrane and Ellington were both extraordinary innovators with different approaches to jazz.  This recording shows how well the two men were able to find common ground and create something terrific.  Coltrane's ability to play ballads and to be simultaneously both creative and simple make him an excellent Ellington sideman.  Similarly, the Duke's deep understanding of jazz gives him the foundation to experiment as a peer with Coltrane.<br />What makes this recording so great is that neither player shows any need to upstage the other; instead they show generosity, sensitivity, and skill.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Driving to work one morning, I heard India Arie being interviewed on public radio.  Unfortunately, I had tuned in towards the end of the interview.  She seemed so comfortable with herself and her music and the pride in this CD was evident in her voice.  When they played a portion of Brown Skin, I just wanted to hear more.  As soon as I got to work, I logged onto Amazon to search for this CD and ordered it immediately.  I usually have it playing round and round -- it is absolutely wonderful and I would highly recommend it to one and all!
B000002UA7|3.0|Kate Bush is one of the most creative artists in Rock, and deserves better than the American market ever gave her.<br />This is a fine collection of her hits, but I've never understood why Bush and EMI felt the need to include a &quot;new vocal&quot; version of &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;  What was the problem they saw in the single version, which gave Bush her first major UK hit and was her signature record for years?<br />Other than that I have no complaints, except that this could easily have been a double LP.
B00003CXP1|5.0|If school boards and parents were smart they'd throw programs like D.A.R.E. out the window and should just show this movie. Unlike movies like Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, where Drug use is glamorized, this film is the grim reality of it.  It was a great touch to have the mother addicted to legal diet pills and show the side effects.  Arronofsky has definately improved his technique since his debut film Pi. Personally, this was the best picture I saw for 2000. Julia Roberts might have done a good job, but I doubt she could have played the part Ellen Burstyn did. Excellent job. This film is not for the faint of heart or people who don't appreciate good cinema.  I look forward to the next outing by this up and coming auteur.
B00000DLUV|5.0|&quot;One Night Only&quot; is a good a masterpiece of live recording as 1977's &quot;Here At Last...Bee Gees...Live&quot; was. All the great songs are here, plus a few odd album cuts that truly make this set shine. Highlights include, &quot;Grease&quot; with a thunderous crowd roaring approval; &quot;(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away', a true tearjerker with prerecorded Andy Gibb singing with his brothers and &quot;Immortality&quot;, with a wonderful Celine Dion backed by the brothers. The CD is crisp, clean and clear. It is amazing to hear such fantastic producers who's studio recordings sound the same in concert.  This is a classic CD!
6301942647|1.0|After reading the video cover I wondered how one man can sum up our dreams, but Akira Kurosawa sums up our worried dreams (if not all dreams are worries).<br />There is a visionary visual glimpse into what might happen with our nuclear situation, with demons feeding off each other and realistical portrail of horrific chemicals. Childish innocence is shown in the opening 'dream', man's strife and wars are visual treats along with Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh. But Kurosawa does not leave the train of thought unfinished. He shows us an idelic simple living that makes surprising sense but it is something moderns will have difficulty swallowing.<br />As in early Kurosawa films the stories are there leaving us to wonder but his last works are visual contemplations of this hellish world. The lack of conversations may leave some fidgeting but look beyond smallness and understand.
B000002UVZ|5.0|I bought the tape back in 1987 for a road trip to Auburn University.  I can recall every aspect of the trip thanks to this one (I also put a pretty good listen on Til' Tuesdays Voices Carry, a highly underrated piece of work).  The power of this classic is evident, as has been stated, from the opening of Begin.  This is the strongest output from Buck of all REM albums.  Not necessarily the workmanship but the strength and passion he puts into Begin, I Believe, and especially These Days, you have to move some part of your body.  Fall On Me is more of a classic than Losing My Religion or Man On The Moon could ever dream of being.  This music harkens back to REM being more political in their message, i.e. the beautiful Swan, What If, and Flowers: all of which float like petals in the wind, not as much as Document, while still lending itself to more personal pop that would follow on Green, etc.  You would almost think that Monster should have followed this one.<br />For me, the pinnacle is the last song, Superman.  I used this as a courtship song to get my wife.  This song is a flag for fun alternative 80's music.  As always Stipe and Mills's voice run through this song like honey in your ears.<br />If for some reason this one is not a part of your REM collection, you must purchase this. As a matter of fact, you should have every REM CD up to and including Green.  If all the aforementioned CD's were a flower, Life's would be the bloom.
B00005AR3G|4.0|There is a moment in THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE that illustrates the point I wish to make about the film. The Emperor has been turned into a llama and is lost in the jungle. He gave a squirrel who tried to help him a hard time and is now stuck in a nest of sleeping jaguars. The squirrel blows up a balloon and pops it. The jaguars don't wake up, but wake up from a lighter sound the Emperor makes.    If you have seen cartoons like Bugs Bunny and Tom & Jerry (which used the above mentioned gag a number of times) you will recognize it. The whole scene is right out of those old cartoon shorts. And cartoon is the best way to describe THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE. Even the animation itself is straight out of a cartoon. It's 2-dimensional and not what you would expect from Disney.  That's not a bad thing. I'm a huge fan of the old cartoons, especially the MGM cartoons that Tex Avery directed. They were fast paced, full of energy, and had one laugh after another. The director Mark Dindal and the animators of THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE do the same thing. In addition to the balloon gag, they use classic cartoon gags like the avaitor-hit-by-lightning, the waterfall, and one that I haven't seen in years: The Angel/Devil inner voices.    The voices were well chosen for each character. I believe that sooner or later every celebrity actor ends up doing an animated character's voice. David Spade, who practically made his whole career playing annoying jerks, finds the right note as the emperor. John Goodman's Pacha reminds me of his character on ROSEANNE, a kind and loveable big lug. Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton are hilarious as the villain Yzma and her sidekick, Kronk. Kitt hasn't had a jucier role since she did Catwoman on the old BATMAN TV series.    I learned that the film started out as another serious animated musical for Disney but something went wrong. The filmmakers threw out the original animation and started all over again. Perhaps they found out it wouldn't work as a seriousfilm. Also, I knew that Sting was supposed to do a lot more songs than what ended up. I have no idea how it would have turned up, but the final result is an entertaining, gag-filled movie.    This Special Edition DVD has an excellent picture and sound quality. It also continues a new standard for Disney of transferring the image from the digital source instead of the film negative. (It was first done with A BUG'S LIFE, and later with TARZAN and TOY STORY 2.) Disney also seems committed to providing DTS digital sound on it's new DVD releases. A smart move, since DTS is superior in dynamic range and bass effect to Dolby Digital 5.1 The disk also contains three behind the scenes featurettes, a look at the making of Sting's \\"My Funny Friend & Me\\" song, interactive games, and a commentary by the director and his crew. The commentary is interesting at the end of the picture. The director discusses a dilemma he faced with ending the movie.
B00005J6T0|1.0|How can one write a review when there are no songs on it.  Get off your duffs and finish writing discriptions of the products you offer.  This happens entirely to often!
B00005B36H|5.0|Maybe huge Aenima fans were looking for another \\"Useful Idiot\\" or \\"(-) Ions\\" when they  went to the store to get Lateralus, which is why they may think it's not very good, or that it's crap.  But instead, they got 79 minutes of spectacular songs.  Don't get me wrong; Aenima's good, but its massive inconsistencies angered me profoundly (what with 6 out of the 15 tracks being interludes of noises), but even the 3 throw-away tracks on Lateralus are cool (don't listen to \\"Mantra\\" in the dark).  The real songs are incredible; \\"Lateralis\\", \\"Parabola\\", \\"Schism\\", and \\"The Patient\\" are among my favorites.  The APC influences on this album in my opinion help it a lot.  Maynard's voice is better here on Lateralus than on any other album; it's very melodic, yet still powerful and aggresive.   Hopefully this, along with other new releases/ coming releases by Weezer and Stabbing Westward will put rock back on the top of the charts where it belongs.  Don't listen to those disgruntled Tool fans that say this sucks because it's not just like their other albums, people.  Buy this immediately.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is a great film. Like Ritchie's first film it has impeccable directing, origional camera shots, and enticing dialogue, but &quot;Snatch&quot; has an added drgree of glitz that makes it a must-see. Not only is it a great film, but its really funny. I definitly reccomend this movie.
0451191153|5.0|Those that love this novel fall into two groups: 1) Individualists and 2) People who see little or no philosophical message in Rand's writing (almost unbelievable to consider, yet...) Those that hate this novel fall into a single, huddling mass: Socialists.<br />The Fountainhead is clearly philosophical in nature, and in that, it deals with ideals. To criticize this book for being expressed in idealistic terms is like criticizing \\"Saving Pvt. Ryan\\" for being violent or \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" for being dark.  Accordingly, Rand's heroes directly represent those ideals and can appear transparent; her supporting characters, however, are anything but. The insight she gives into human motivation is grossly under-appreciated. <br />The story itself flows and its prose is impossibly beautiful at times. You will, most likely, be captivated.<br />Read this book without prejudice; it is profound.
079284131X|1.0|Ever since I was little I have absolutlely hated this movie with a total passion. I hate to sound negative as I talk about something but I just can't stand this movie. I believe that the whole of movie's about evil dolls are becoming so stupid because they have been overdone. I mean what is the premise for a movie like this. It is a horrible plot and leaves nothing to the imagination (If you would just sit down and think about it). I'm sorry but it gets the one star because I just can't like a movie that has an evil doll as one of the main characters.
0553296981|5.0|One must remember that Anne went into hiding at the age of 13, and at the same was going through puberty and expierenceing these two things at the same time.  Aged by her circumstances, but treated as a child, Anne turns to the diary as a single confidante.  She wasn't a complainer, she was silent.  These things must be understood.  She wrote a book that gave a human voice to a faceless tragedy.  When one reads it, one will understand that the people who died during the Holocaust, the russians, the jews, the poles, and the soliders who fought Hitler's armies, were people, with lives and familys, and not just a face to be glimpsed for an instant.  BTW it hurts me every time I see/hear an adult say that this book is over romanticzed, and that Anne wasn't a good writer.  If this is so true, than why is this one of the worlds most well known books?
0930289455|4.0|This book suffers from the same problem as most superhero graphic novels: It won't mean much to you unless you are already familiar with the character and his/her history.  If you are not familiar with Batman and his history, or are only interested in Alan Moore because of such works as the Watchmen or From Hell, this only gets 2 stars as it is the weakest work I have ever read from the otherwise amazing Alan Moore (the Bolland artwork is fantastic, but not enough to save the story otherwise).  Other than its insights into the two characters (Batman and Joker) it has nothing interesting to say.  However, if you are familiar with Batman, this is an interesting and entertaining look at the eternal battle between Batman and the Joker and its underlying psychology, and is one of the first works to note that such characters as the Joker would not have arisen in the Batman universe if Batman himself did not exist (a sort of yin/yang thing).   And seeing Batman and Joker sharing a laugh over a joke is a wonderful moment, but only if you are familiar with the two.<br />This book is also interesting for its rare retelling of Joker's origin (again, only of real interest to Batman fans).  The only other one I am aware of is from the 1930s or 40s.  It is also the story in which Batgirl gets raped and becomes handicapped.  Much better than other Bat-crap like Knightsfall.
0782008372|2.0|Why? Why god why? Why did they have to ruin it?  I was walking through the store looking for Highlander on DVD. When I came across it, I wasn't sure at first due to its low price at 10 bucks. I just figured it wasn't that popular in that store, so I bought it.  As I unwrapped it, I couldn't wait to see the clear picture and the great sound of a classic movie on DVD! I then place the DVD in the player it turn it on. NOOOOO!! There are white specs flying across the screen! There are dust particles in the film! The pixles are visible! The music is blasting! The dialogue is almost muted! AAAAGGGGHHHHHH!! turning up the volume and turning down the volume constantly and then finding no special features to the movie. I love this movie, and it's a shame to watch it be carelessly converted into a CD that is actually worse than the VHS version! Please! Re-do this DVD!! Call it back!! Re-master it!
B000003CMC|5.0|I will never be tired of Mountain Jam - period.  This instrumental is the basis for all other music to be measured.  Basically, I view everything as either pre or post &quot;Mountain Jam.&quot;  In reality, this particular golden nugget of music is the measuring stick for the ages.  If you have never heard it a couple thousand times, you are missing out on music.  This is truly great music.
B00003CXQX|5.0|You will not regret it!  If I had known how entertaining and clever this movie was, I would have taken my son to see it when it was in the theater.  I am pretty tired of the &quot;Disney Formula&quot; and this animated movie has revitalized my expectations for the company.  The voices are a riot from the fabulous Eartha Kitt as a hilarious villaness to her brawny sidekick Kronk (Patrtick &quot;Putty&quot; Warburton) to the condescending but humorous Spade.  <br />Disney casts aside sappy sentimentality in this flick to emphasize humor and wit.  A great example is the portrayal of Pacha's pregnant wife at home alone with two young children who cleverly uses her kids to thwart the antagonists.  Surprising and extremely funny.  As trite as it may sound, this film &quot;works on many levels&quot; providing clever humor for adults with great visuals and jokes for kids.  And the theme of kindness and selflessness is done with uncharacterisitcally subtleness without losing the message.<br />For the price of rentals these days, the cost of owning the movie is not that much more, especially given the number of times we view it.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase and glad I looked past a premise that seemed absurd to enjoy one of the most creative films to come from Disney in a long time.
0060955775|4.0|Yes, We all have our own idiosyncrasies. Most of us bury them to follow the social norms. The author manages to explain the delicate balance between what one perceives a 'nutter' to be and the true definition.<br />I did guess the twist from the beginning and it slightly distracted from the eventual climax, however I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
0684853523|2.0|Stephen King has provided me with immense reading pleasure for more than twenty-five years.  I remember first reading him while I was a graduate student in Ireland.  I always loved horror, the macabre, and other ghoulish tales, so when I saw a paperback copy of  \\"Salem's Lot\\" in a department store bookstand on O'Connell Street, I quickly bought it and spent a day in my room reading it beginning to end.  I read \\"Carrie\\" shortly after that and even saw the heavily edited version of the movie in Dublin, where censors savagely brought scissors to celluloid.  I became, in short, a Stephen King fan.<br />After returning to the States, I continued as an avid King reader.  The timing was usually convenient, since paperback editions of his novels appeared in the bookstores just around the time I was finishing my graduate school exams, or embarking on a summer vacation when I began working for a living, and provided a convenient escape from reality.  I vividly remember, for example, lying in bed, the covers up to my chin, reading \\"The Shining\\" alone in the dark New York City night in my studio apartment.  I still regard \\"The Shining\\" as King's finest novel.  <br />Over the years, I've continued to read and enjoy Stephen King, avoiding only his fantasy works (such as \\"The Dark Tower\\").  King knows how to tell a story and his ability to weave contemporary culture into his fiction is unsurpassed.  He is, in short, one of the best of this generation's popular writers even though his work has often been relegated to the horror genre.<br />Having read most of King's published fiction, I looked forward to reading \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\\", hoping to gain insight into King's approach to writing and an understanding of how some of his novels have been written.  I was, unfortunately, disappointed.<br />\\"On Writing\\" is generally broken into four parts.  The first part, covering approximately the first half of the book, is a loosely organized autobiographical sketch of King's life.  For someone who has followed King's career, there is little new here and it's only value is as another short riff on King's life.  The second part of the book, covering most of the second half of the book, provides King's insights on writing.  King has little new to offer and, frankly, his suggestions are of little value to anyone who has actually engaged in the writing trade.  It is helpful, if at all, only to the neophyte who has little or no knowledge of writing or useful writers' references (such as Strunk and White).  The remaining two short sections contain a narrative of King's near-fatal 1999 accident (which has been published elsewhere) and a short section illustrating the rewrite of one of King's stories.  <br />If you're a Stephen King fan, then \\"On Writing\\" is probably worth the short investment of time it takes to read this somewhat disjointed book.  If you're not, don't judge King by this book and don't expect to learn much about the craft of writing.  It's an interesting insight into the author, but not an interesting insight into the author's craft.
B00005AR3G|3.0|Sorry to rain on the parade here, but I have to say this was a disappointment.  I felt it lacked the humor, engaging storyline and quality of animation of most previous Disney releases.  Not to say that it was bad, just not on par with what I've come to expect from Disney.  I bought it blind thinking I couldn't go wrong with Disney and Spade (I'm fans of both).  But Spade never hits his stride here.  He does a respectable job, but it's by no means vintage Spade.  Even my two small children lost interest in the middle on the first viewing.  If you've not seen it, I recommend you rent before you buy.
0767819446|5.0|There is not much I can say about this movie, other than I think it is a great film!<br />I've watched too many movies of this genre to say that  Iwas really surprised by too much, but that doesn't mean that it didn't interest me....
0800187881|3.0|Though at first it seems like Babs settled by accepting the marriage proposal of charming math professor Jeff Bridges, the two come to realize they really do complete each other in this romantic comedy.<br />Stealing the show is mother-of-the-bride, Lauren Bacall, in her Oscar-nominated performance, embodying the wise-cracking, put-down spewing, disapproving mother so well known to many of us.  Though we come to see her as a source of friction in the life of her daughters (Barbra and Mimi Rogers), we also see her arc over to helping Barbra fufill her dreams of realizing a true love match.  Watch for Bacall's most poignant scene as she confesses the true nature of the marriage she had with the girls' father.  It is here, in the more quiet moments of the film, we see Bacall's strength as an actor.<br />As far as Babs' directing chops, she best identifies the strong dichotomy between her two main characters--the English professor, played by herself, and her husband, the math professor as portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  She is kinesthetic, while he is contained; she is all about hands-on experiences, while he is more about removed learning; she is vibrant and funny; he is reserved and ill-at-ease with even himself.  The scenes in which we see him falling more and more for Barbra show he is perhaps most ill-at-ease with the thought of having indeed found that special someone!<br />The cast is rounded out effectively by George Seagal, playing Bridges' best friend, and a small part of note is played by Elle McPherson as one of Bridges' former lovers.  <br />For those who love a good romantic comedy, this film is a must!  Nothing too complex, nothing too long, and nothing bad about this film!  Even the song was up for an Oscar!
B00005B36H|5.0|I bought the new Tool album not exactly sure what to expect ( but then, who knows what to expect when it comes to Tool?), and after a listen to all 70+ minutes, I must say that it's really great.  I must first-off say that I am a fan of Tool, but I do not worship them and think they are the greatest thing since the invention of the wheel, like many do.  Second, I was kind of dissapointed with a good portion of &quot;Aenima&quot;.  I mean, there was definitely some good stuff on it, but how anyone can call it the greatest album of all time is beyond me.  With &quot;Lateralus&quot;, they have accomplished what I hoped to get out of &quot;Aenima&quot;.  Rather than clutter the album with numerous tracks of random noise (literally, I'm not calling the songs noise), they have filled the album with long, progressive type compositions that are stunningly great, and not boring for a second.  Just listen to &quot;Schism&quot;, &quot;Parabol&quot;, &quot;Parabola&quot;, and &quot;Reflection&quot;, they are amazing. At 78:59, this album is tied with Metallica's &quot;Load&quot; as one of the longest single-disc studio albums I have heard.  Nearly every song tops 8 minutes, and they just demand to be listened to!  Flowing melodies, building into brutal heaviness, I mean it's just great!  Of course, it wouldn't be Tool without a few &quot;noise&quot; tracks.  &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse&quot; is a very brief instrumental, &quot;Mantra&quot;, is a series of what sounds like whale noises, and the last track (which I won't even attempt to spell) is a distorted, slightly disturbing recording of a guy who was abducted by aliens are something.  But these things don't hold the album back, like they did &quot;Aenima&quot;.  Also, this album does not have the f-word a billion times, which fits the mentality of Limp Bizkit better than it does Tool.  In fact, I don't think there's any cursing on here at all.  So, to wrap up this lengthy review: If you are a Tool fan, you cannot be without this.  The music is very tight, and Maynard's vocals have never sounded better.  This could be their best yet.  Tool is the new Pink Floyd.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley has inspired me both musically and on a personal level. He was a beautiful man, uniquely talented and a voice that many have tried to emulate but NO ONE has ever come close to beating.<br />When I first heard the song &quot;Grace&quot; I was simply blown away, I could not believe that music that beautiful and a voice so expansive could ever exist. There is so much to enjoy on this album and I would be doing an injustice to Jeff's masterpiece by choosing a &quot;best&quot; song as their simply isn't one. You must listen to the album as a whole.<br />It saddens me to think that Jeff died never knowing how popular he was to become, real artists mention Jeff among their favourite artists and influences.<br />In a way though, I feel priviliged that I have been able to hear something so beautiful. Jeff's memory among his fans will live on forever, and his music is timeless.<br />By way of a footnote, if &quot;Grace&quot; has inspired you as much as it has me then please check out &quot;My Sweetheart the Drunk&quot; which is a collection songs he recorded before he died which may, or may not, have ended up on his next album.
B00004XOWM|1.0|ok, im a lb fan for awhile now and i really loved the 1st cd which was original and a really good mix of metal guitars/phat basses and all around good rappin from narcisistic vocalist fred durst.i also loved the 2nd cd which single handedly implented the rapcore\funkmetal into the collective mainsteream of the world of music so u can just imagine my excitment when i heard bout chocolate starfish comin out and wes borland sayin that lb r going back to their old roots from cd 1, sadly this is not the case for CS is a cd that reflects the band as a total sellout in which they try to sell any style they can and instead of focusin on what they do best durst trys to rap like Dre ona guitar beat with a winy voice,lb r tryin to sell all genres from hardcore  hip hop (getcha groove on and rollin with DMX and meth) to grunge (the one has a grunge song build up) and it is a nice idea to be all styles but when all u do is try to sell then u fail and lose ure creative style when u try to appeal to certain groups in the music industry and want to please all.
B000059MEK|1.0|I really can't believe why so many people actually gave this piece of cheesy (stuff) 5 stars! It looks like most people can't tell good music from a hole in the ground. Compared to their earlier release \\"Homework\\" (and most other electronic dance albums) this album just plain (stinks). All the songs are badly written and covered with tons of sticky, slimy, gooey cheese. Don't bother buying this.
0060273224|5.0|This book is remarkable, and I couldn't put it down. It was just so exciting and it brought you into it's world. Sabriel was a very well scripted charecter and the magic was amazing. The thought that must have gone into this book must have been an amazing zmount. The way he ties in the present with a mystical twist. It's a great book and I give it five stars. Definitly one of my favorite books, on the top of my list.
B00000DHRX|5.0|George Michael's career retrospective Ladies And Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael, is a must have. The first disc titled &quot;for the heart&quot; is a collection of George's greatest ballads, 14 tracks, everything from Jesus to a Child, You Have Been Loved, Careless Whisper, Cowboys and Angels, and more. The second disc is titled &quot;for the feet&quot;, a collection of his upbeat dance numbers such as Fastlove, Freedom, Spinning The Wheel, Hard Day, Monkey, I Want Your Sex, I Knew You Were Waiting and more, a total of 14 more tracks. This is 28 song collection and Epic does a wonderful job of getting the hits here. George Michael has made some of the most memorable music and this a collection of his best, so you can remember all those great songs that you once loved, perhaps you still do. Essential.
B000002JSN|5.0|No matter what you can say, a band just cant record more than one album like this in their career. God, this album is so damned fine !!The production is very good, the tunes are diverse and using a lot of styles without being indulgent. LED ZEPPELIn is at the top here, no doubt this album is better than &quot;IV&quot;. All the songs have their own idendity, the musicians seem to be delightful in recording the album, everything is in his right place.
0783225784|5.0|When people ask me to name my top 10 movies, they are always astonished when I say Animal House is on the list. This is a hilarious film and every scene works virtually on its own. Some of my favorite lines: &quot;Seven years of college down the drain.&quot; &quot;Food fight!&quot; &quot;Did we give up when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?&quot; You cannot fully appreciate this movie when it is shown on TV because so many things have to be cut. My solution is to own the movie. Highly recommended.
B000002TPS|5.0|&quot;Youthanasia&quot; is just an all-around, great CD. The disc gets off to a fantastic start with &quot;Reckoning Day&quot; - a song that begins with a thunderous drum and guitar intro.The discs second track, &quot;Train Of Consequences&quot; has to be one of the more impressive songs on the album. The guitar intro begins hard and edgy and takes the song off to some cool rhythms that are held throughout the tune. One of the better moments in the song is during the chorus while Mustaine sings and continues to play quarter-note triplets simultaneously.&quot;Addicted To Chaos&quot; opens with a cool drum intro as the guitar rhythms fade in. This being another great highlight of the CD.The overall guitar work and lyric writting on this CD are truly incredible.&quot;A Tout Le Monde&quot; is a haunting-memorium song that I feel is one of the better tracks.The title track &quot;Youthanasia&quot; speaks a lot of truth about us as people that are 'left out to dry' in many instances, which explains the album cover. This song alone is a definitely worth listening to.One of the more unique songs I have run across is the last song on this disc......&quot;Victory&quot;.Mustaine took song and album titles from each of Megadeth recordings and incorporated them into one song. It all came out really cool how the titles fitted in the song.Here's an an excerpt, with the song titles in parentheses.......Now one day I started telling everyone that &quot;killing is my buisness...&quot; and I was hung like a martyr for &quot;looking down the cross&quot; my &quot;skull beneath the skin&quot;......And that is just the beginning of the song.I feel this album only proves how great a songwriter that Mustaine is. He, in my opinion, is underrated for his songwritting abilities.
B000002JSN|5.0|Although Led Zeppelin has never put out a bad album, this one may stand above the rest as their musical masterpiece.  One thing about Zeppelin's music is the differing styles used, and this album is a prime example.<br />This album features a bunch of great riffs, along with a few acoustic tracks, and the incredible &quot;Kashmir&quot;, showing the extreme diveristy and talent of the band.  Page has once again proven his status as one of rock's all-time greats, check out the guitar on &quot;Ten Years Gone.&quot; <br />So, if you own any of Zeppelin's albums, make sure that this one is in your collection.  You will definately see why Zeppelin has influenced so many other bands and styles, and why their music has stood the test of time.
B00004XONN|5.0|I've read some of the other reviews, which throw around words like &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and &quot;original&quot;... And while I think Kid A is very unique stuff, it's not like Radiohead really created a whole new genre of music.  They took their formidable songwriting skills and their new interest in studio tricks and computerized sounds, and meshed the two seamlessly.  Is this the start of a new era of popular music?  Nooooo.  We're not going to see Britney, Matchbox 20, Creed, Nsuck, and the rest either fall off the face of the earth or start making music like this.  It probably won't have a profound influence on future generations, as has been suggested.<br />What this album is, is just good music.  Sometimes when an album gets the kind of critical attention that Kid A has gotten, you just have to step back, forget the terms and cliches that have been thrown at it, and just LISTEN to the darned CD.  Decide for yourself whether YOU like it or not, and do it on your own terms, with your own reasons.  That's what listening to music is all about anyway.  Either you like it or you don't, and you're perfectly entitled to that opinion.  Other CDs where this particular quandary have occurred: Loveless by My Bloody Valentine, Slanted and Enchanted, and so on.  Just because other people heap all of this praise on an album doesn't mean you have to agree or even like the thing.  I for one HATE Slanted and Enchanted because I think the musicianship is just terrible - but that album is hailed as the ultimate indie release...anyway, the point of that digression was that it doesn't really matter what critics say.  they may give you an idea of what the album will be like, but they can't decide whether you like it or not.  It's not like I'm WRONG about Slanted and Enchanted.  I just don't like it.  Others are free to worship it as they please.  the same holds true for Kid A.  If you don't like it, it's not like you're &quot;missing something&quot;.  There isn't some profound, spiritual thing surrounding Kid A that only the &quot;enlightened&quot; understand.  It's just an album.  I think it's a very good album.  Not the best ever, but one of the best lately.  Feel free to disagree...<br />I like Kid A because I find it very interesting.  Radiohead has departed from their beginnings and used almost entirely studio/computer-driven sounds, but maintained their amazing songwriting aesthetic.  I really enjoy the shifts from ambient, warbling tracks to more abrasive songs like Idioteque.  I think it was very well conceived and the songs are very tight in their production.  I think it's great stuff, and even if the press had blasted it and no one bought it, I'd feel the same way.  Can you say the same?
B00000J6AG|5.0|Simply stated, Moby is an amazing talent.  The music, instruments, mixing, and vocals are all awesome. For anyone with a good ear and appreciation of fabulous music, this CD is a must in your library.
B00005J73X|5.0|I guess I am the lucky first one to review this album. This has been what fans have waited for! I have already listened to the whole thing twice!!! It's absolutely amazing. I especially love Runaway because they sound so young and so full of life. Many critics have shut down this live treat because they don't think that Bon Jovi rocks hard enough. I say to hell with them, all bon jovi fans know that it isn't true and is proved with ONE WILD NIGHT: LIVE 1985-2001 my entire lifespan so far. go get this one asap and you'll be glad you did. JERSEY BOYS ROCK!!! LONG LIVE BON JOVI!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a Tool album that is not to be taken lightly.  Lateralus reminds me a lot of NIN's \\"the fragile\\" in the sense that on the first listen all I could think to say was, \\"wow...that's different.\\"<br /><br />Now that I've listened to it more, it is one of my favorite albums that I own.  Songs like The Grudge, Schism, Lateralus, and Reflection keep me begging for more.  Some words of advice:  You have to give this album a chance.  Believe me, it will grow on you quickly.  This is one album that you can't just download (illegally), take one listen and pass it as (junk).  This challenges you into having an attention span.<br /><br />Of course, this is still Tool, and they are still very heavy and in your face.  Where Lateralus differs from past albums is the roller coaster ride it takes you on.  Songs like \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" literally stop on a dime and start back again just as quickly.  Give this album a try and learn to have an attention span.  I guarantee you will not be sorry.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I don't have any doubt that this is the best film of 2000. A powerful, disturbing, and beautiful film. The story of four people searching for acceptance and love, while trying to pursue their \\"dreams\\". This may look feasible at first in the midst of the sunny summer season. But we quickly see their addictions have them headed for disaster. The seasons of Fall and Winter shows us how their downward spiral is accelerated with each of these seasonal changes, and that there will not be a \\"spring renewal\\" for any of them. It shows us that even when Harry and Marion are \\"together\\" they really aren't with the genius use of split screen. The montage sequences (camera work and editing)are brilliant, the musical score is tragically poignant. All of the  performances are incredibly human, and heartfelt. The films final half hour is a tour de force in filmmaking and unlike anything you've ever seen in a film before !! This is a film that will be with you days after seeing it, and you will never forget it. I feel it is a film that's \\"required viewing\\" for all, especially anyone who loves films and all aspects of filmmaking technique. Make sure you either purchase or rent the \\"Director's Cut\\" of this film (which is un-rated) and not the R-rated version.
078401213X|5.0|The this reviews title bears the whole truth about the movie Pi.  It a one of a kind scifi thriller that leaves you wondering and guessing to the spectacular ending that you would not of guessed.  The movie shows the paranoia of middle aged mathematician that is possesed by his inscrupulous doubt that everyone and everything are out to get him.  His only outlet is a friendly companion that soon leads him on to believe that chaos cannot have a pattern and his attempts are futile, as the old man relives his past experience with the workings of Pi.  Throughtout the movie the man is hunted by Wall Street, Hasanic Jews, and a crippling disease that requires constant attention and medication.  The ending is suberb as the young man learns the truth about nature through his weaknesses.  Its a must see but certainly not a tv movie.
B00005B36I|5.0|Tool's Lateralus comes into view as a jumbled mess upon first hearing it, but rather unfolds to a highly rewarding experience to the seasoned Tool fan and bearer of patience.  The songs take about eight or so minutes a piece and the best parts you have to wait for. (Except the chorus for the album's seventh track, Parabola, which comes in at around forty seconds.)  The disc proves Tool to be experienced musicians, still pushing their limits of playing and arranging, showing off their improvement of arranging and altering the typical boundaries of song structure.  Most songs don't even repeat the same parts twice.  Once you get through the skin of Lateralus and pick up it's innumerous nuances, you'll find it to be the most genius album ever created by humans anywhere ever.  Buy two copies
0425163407|5.0|I personally loved the book. The involvement of mystery with the Internet and killings drew me to the book even more. Every time you turn the page you just have to keep reading to find out what will happen next. Cornwell is a very graphic writer, which makes you even more engrossed into the story line. When Cornwell wrote about the email messages and notes the DEADOC (the killer) it brought fear into you. At one point, I had goosebumps! All around this was another great book by Cornwell. I will continue reading books by her.
068484267X|5.0|It took Frank McCourt 20 years to write it, but it only took me two days to read it, and I'll never forget it.  I'm not one of those people who give out 5 stars easily but this was truly one of the best books I've ever read.  I feel like I really know Mr. McCourt and the Ireland that he knew.  I cried with him and I laughed with him.  It's a story about family, love, poverty, religion, human nature.  I learned so much from reading this book.  My husband and I agree that we are going to share this book with our children as soon as they are old enough just so they can see how lucky they are to live in a prosperous time (not that we are rich people - but I know our children have never experienced hunger the way Mr. McCourt and his family have).  It's not how much you have, but what you make of it.  <br />I have also learned about writing from reading this book.  His organization is superb and his writing style is very engaging.  Even the saddest parts are written with wit and a sharpness that transcends beyond the emotions to get to the human truth.  I cannot praise this book enough.  If nothing else, read it and step into a great person's shoes for a while.
B00003CWN3|5.0|:-------------------------------------------------- Warning : This review reveals critical plot points.<br />From what I've read and seen, Kimberly Pierce fell in love with Brandon Teena. It's that simple. She said as much on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; and in different publications. It is this kind of forth-right and brave honesty that has allowed her to make such an amazingly powerful film.<br />Most of us already know about the awards and accolades. Hilary Swank acted her way to an Academy Award, Chloe Sevigny to a nomination. It made just about everyone's top 10 list. It got the Big Thumbs Up from Roger Ebert. It won Golden Globes and IFP/West Independent Spirit awards. The list goes on, multiple Film Fest inclusions, etc.<br />People - there is a reason for all the hoop-la.<br />This is, quiet honestly, the most powerful film to hit the American landscape since &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;.<br />It is brutal in it's honesty and highly emotional in it's story-telling.<br />Hilary Swank ( previously known for a stint on &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; and a starring role in &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; ) deserves every award she's been given. She turns in a standing-ovation of a performance. Nuanced and gentle, swaggering and tough, you will believe that people accepted Brandon as a man, there's no doubt. Hilary Swank became Brandon Teena, they are inseparable.<br />Chloe Sevigny ( from &quot;Kids&quot; and more recently &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; and &quot;American Psycho&quot; ) also turns in an amazing performance as Brandon's girlfriend.<br />There is raw emotion and electricity traveling between these young actresses and it lights up the screen.<br />The vision, though, belongs to Kimberly Pierce. She's done an outstanding job directing this film - allowing it to be both brutal ( the rape scene ) and beautiful ( Lana and Brandon making love ).<br />I walked away feeling drained, and I will admit it, a little depressed. I couldn't talk about the film for days, it moved me so personally.<br />You may end up shaking your head, unbelieving, but this is a true story, based on real people. That makes it all the more touching.<br />This film is highly recommended. It's one of the best Independent ( or mainstream for that matter ) Films ever made.<br />You will be moved, that is certain.<br />Bestfilm for days, it moved me so personally. <br />You may end up shaking your head, unbelieving, but this is a true story, based on real people.

B000002L99|5.0|If you ever buy just one Van Halen album in your entire life, make sure it's this one.  A high dose of terrific songs from beginning to end, it's one you will never get tired of listening to.
B00005B36H|5.0|some musicans are brave enough to explore the unknown.  don't be afraid. tool is and always will be ahead of  its time.
B00005J73X|3.0|I was very excited when I heard about this live album, espescially since it supposedly had performances spanning Bon Jovi's entire career.  More that half of these songs are from the Crush tour, however, so not much of Bon Jovi's early days are represented.  Some songs, such as Bad Medicine, actually sound more tame than the studio versions.  Also, to say that there are a few songs left out would be a huge understatement. On the good side though, there are killer versions of &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; and &quot;In and Out of Love.&quot;  &quot;Rockin' in the Free World&quot; is also a cool cover song.  I recommend this album if you are a true Bon Jovi fan, because it is very good.  It just should have been so much better.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Natural Born Killers is worth some appreciation for Stone's effort to bring classic surrealism back to the screen while still maintaining accessibility and mainstream appeal. As a work of art, Natural Born Killers ultimately wins, but unfortunately, the film is too choppy to provide Stone's message in a coherent form at times. Sometimes they're obvious, and other times they're contradicted. Stone has created some excellent characters regardless, and it's surprising that the show stealer here is none other than Robert Downey Jr. (this is excluding Tommy Lee Jones's performance, as should be noted).<br />This DVD is more or less the same collector's edition that was released on VHS. The commentary is definitely worth the extra bucks to get the DVD version, however, as Stone presents his ideas in a more understandable manner here. Also, for haters of the film's artistic quality, his commentary also aids in the understanding of the near-dead genre of surrealism in filmmaking.
B00004THAY|5.0|C'mon!  It's Clapton and King!  Need I say more? OK, here's more.  The picture shows Clapton driving, but the CD has BB in the driver's seat.  Still, you can hear the influence of both.  My favorite cuts are Riding with the King, Marry You, Help the Poor, and Come Rain or Come Shine.  By the way, I've noticed several albums that BB calls his best ever.  This doesn't deserve that distinction -- it's not the best album he appears in, and it's not totally &quot;his.&quot;  But it always stays in my car CD player for a few days when I get it out.
630575067X|5.0|Mooie, mooie, whatta awesome movie! Mesa gives it five stars jus because of dat cutie Jar Jar Binks! Hesa jus da bombaddest, cutest Gungan ever! Mesa would luv to take him home with me and hug him all day long. Oh mooie, I wanna play with those cute lil toes of his! And that tongue of his...<br />*Clears throat*<br />Okay, this movie was basically awesome. The special effects were top-notch and the action sequences were incredible. However, I would have hoped for the acting to be a little better, but you really can't complain given everything else the movie has to offer. After all, Star Wars isn't exactly about acting, and the acting in the originals was nothing to write home about. <br />The Podrace scene was just a blast, and the lightsaber battles were edge-of-your seat excitement. <br />There is lots of subtle symbolism and metaphors in the movie that can be easily overlooked by many people. You have look deeper to understand the full meaning of the themes going on throughout the film.<br />I know that alot of people don't like Jar Jar, but I'm pretty much crazy about him (as you can see from the opening paragraph). There is really no reason to hate Jar Jar - he is just an innocent caught up in an adventure. He can't help that his voice sounds different and that he is clumsy. The world wouldn't be a very nice place if everyone hated someone based upon such things. There's something called &quot;diversity&quot; and I think that some people need to learn more about it.
0553296981|5.0|THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK is one  of the best novels I've ever read. But it's not a novel; it's actually a diary of a real Jewish-German girl who died in a concentration camp during the Holocoust. The reason why some people may not like this book is because they think it is lacking diolouge or creativity for a novel. But this (I don't think) was ever meant to be a novel. This was meant to be a personal, private written-record for Anne Frank herself and herself only.<br />In this novel (excuse me, &quot;diary&quot;), you will learn all about Anne Frank: Her feelings, thoughts, hopes, dreams, and share her adventures. You will also learn what it was like for Anne and her family while hiding from the Nazi Soldiers and even what it was like for Anne to receive her first kiss and real romance from Peter, a young boy who's family was also hiding from the Nazi in the same room as Anne Frank's family.<br />Read this novel and you will see why something as horrible and unforgettable as the Holocoust should never happen again. Anne Frank was one of the millions who suffered death and pain during the Holocoust for no reason other than the fact that they were &quot;different&quot; from the rest of the Germans. It's an unforgettable classic that you will read over and over again and never get bored. In fact, if you read it over and over again, each time you do, you may find something new that you didn't catch the last time you read it. Beautiful story and a novel I truly recommend as a must have.<br />P.S.: I also saw the new ABC miniseries movie, ANNE FRANK, a couple days ago. That was excellent, too. It was very moving and the acting was supurb. Hopefully, ABC will put it out on video and DVD. If they do, I will definitely buy it and you should, too (if you enjoyed the book!). Both the novel and movie brought me to tears - and I can't say that to just about anything!
B000059HAI|5.0|IF you have not seen this film do so so. Its very good and is not cluttered with a love story or fictional people. GOOD FILM
B000002UV9|5.0|Simply a brilliant album from beginning to end. Even though I believe Mindcrime was a better album(specifically how it was conceptually story based) Empire is a neck and neck with my favorites. From hard rockin songs like Empire and Best I can to Silent Lucidity and Another Rainy Night this album expands all levels of rock! Geoff Tate's vocal range is off the charts, and perhaps the best vocalist in rock history. His voice with the guitars and arrangement of DeGarmo make this album one of the best ever.
B000002NFM|5.0|I bought this CD a couple of weeks ago because I really had gotten into Moby.  Even I with as much ignorance that I had toward techno knew about this CD.  After all, it was the first Techno CD to ever go to #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart.  The lyrics are somewhat meaningless and stupid, but as I have said in other reviews, I rarely buy songs or albums because of lyrics, and let's face it, you are not going to find meaningful lyrics in techno/electronica music.  However, if you like big beats, frenetic pacing, and a rock-and-roll feel, then you will love this album.  Although this is the only album that I have by Prodigy, from reading what other people have said about their other albums this CD was a conscious effort to try to fuse rock with techno.  I think for the most part it was a success with these tracks being the best:<br />1) Smack My B**** Up -- A great driving number that has major bass to it, will really get you pumped--probably don't want to have your girlfriend/wife, mother, or grandmother hear this song, though.<br />2) Breathe -- One of the 2 big hits, it just has an awesome beat and pace to it.<br />3) Diesel Power -- A great track that is highlighted by rapper, Kool Keith who's dropping some serious lyrics.<br />4) Funky S*** -- A song that samples a Beastie Boys song, it is yet another fast-paced, big beat techno song.<br />8) Firestarter -- Maybe the most well-known song along with Breathe, the video was so intense just like the song that it was banned in the BBC.<br />10) Fuel My Fire -- A great rocking track and a great one to end the album on.<br />If you like techno/electronica music or music with big beats or music that just gets you pumped up then you have to buy this CD.
0671027344|5.0|All I can say about this book is that it is one of the best books I have ever read.  Actually, I think that it's my favorite book and I read it in one sitting.  There is something quietly profound about it that makes it one of the books that I will always remember.
B000002UJQ|5.0|As you can see on this site, this album has had over 700 reviews!!  I come to this site I don't know how many times a day and I have never seen an album get that many reviews.  However, you know what--what everybody else has said about this album is true.  It really is the best album of the '90's and maybe the best ever.  If you like manufactured pop like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, NSync, and the Backstreet Boys, then unless they are a guilty pleasure to you like they are to me, then you'll probably won't like this music because it's not manufactured to a formula and it takes multiple listens, with each one getting better, to fully appreciate its genius.  All the tracks are good, but if I had to pick my favorite ones then I would go with the following:<br />1) Airbag--a great song to open, this song shows you what you have to look forward to.<br />2) Paranoid Android--my favorite song, I love how the mood in this song changes so quickly and I also loved the cartoon video.<br />6) Karma Police--the other song that many people know along with Paranoid Android, Thom Yorke gives possibly his finest performance here.<br />10) No Surprises--a little bit lighter than the others, it fits in perfectly with the other songs and the entire album.<br />You owe it to yourself to get this master work of music.  I have to admit that after listening to Top 40 radio for over 20 years, it's a little hard to listen to OK Computer after one listen and say I love it.  However, sit down and really concentrate on the music, and then you'll see the brilliance and understand what all these other people are talking about.
6301640659|1.0|This film has been attacked alot by gays and deservidly so.  It does an effective job of making it seem that every gay man in America dresses in black leather and spends all his time in sleezy bars looking for sex.  If you can ignore this stereo type, you still have a fairly week film.  The script is simply lousy with no real development of plot or character.  The dialoge is pretty atrotious too. Finally, the acting leaves alot to be desired.<br />Some people hate this film because of it's stereotypical veiw of gays.  I hate it because it is just a bad movie.
B00001SIES|5.0|I first heard of MUSE when a mate lent me the showbiz album, and since then they have rose to the top of my favorite bands. Lead singer MATT BELAMY shows off his fantastic vacal talent in each of the great tracks on this CD. He also shows he can do a trick or two with his guitar. with a good mixeture of soft, smooth vocal arrangments and loud up beat bass filled tunes this album really is one of the best debut albums ever released, buy it today. Also watch out for THE ORIGIN OF SYMETRY coming june 18th!!
0671027344|5.0|Stephen Chbosky tells it like it is.  There is a special book for everyone out there, one that you make your own, as Charlie says, and for me this is the one.  The people and some of the events might be different, but I think he captures more than any book I've ever read how I'm feeling now, growing up.  I know that growing up for everyone is different, so that's why some people can't relate, and maybe even be aghast at some of the content here, but for others who are living it, this is how it is.  Rarely, if ever, are there young adult books that deals with [vices], without being preachy like being told from an outsider of adolescent point of view.  The usual books, even the good ones, are told from the viewpoint of preps or at least in a universe where kids, at least the normal ones, don't drink or smoke, and homosexuality and trying a substance once is a major crisis, and being abused and suicide is usually the topic of the book and a major crisis...I always feel like Charlie because i prefer to watch and see.  If you are like that, or at least open or remember growing up like that, this is the book for you.  It's in your face honest, but in a pensive thoughtful way, and if you can get it the theme is amazing. This is the one book I couldn't put down all night, it is truly breathtaking.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Not only do Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman sing, they sing many times, in different styles.  And all their hard work pays off.  This is one spectacular soundtrack!  It's eclectic, jazzy, sentimental, and ingenius.  I was doubtful that this was going to be any good, it takes quite the soundtrack for me to buy it.  This is quite the soundtrack.  Every song is sheer musical delight.  &quot;Rythym of the Night&quot;, &quot;Because you Can Can-Can&quot;, &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;, and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; are already my favorite songs on this album.  This album is a must have for any respectable music lover's collection.
B00005B36H|3.0|If the purpose of this CD was to put me to sleep, it has fully succeeded. Much of the singing is monotone. Overall the CD is mellow, and cleaner sounding than Opiate, Undertow, and Aenima. Anyway, I personally don't like music that puts me to sleep (3 stars), but I guess that's just me (from the reviews so far).
B00000JGHM|5.0|I've seen this action pack thriller on DVD format and stars were magnificent. This is the only movie that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro plays opposite role and they did theyre homework just to please the audience. This DVD is already part of my all time collections and I do recommend this for movie enthusiast and see it for yourself.
B00005J73X|5.0|Bon Jovi has been one of my favorite bands since I was a little kid. That's why this cd like all the others is G-R-E-A-T! It has the best live recording of &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and &quot;Someday I'll Be Saturday Night&quot; that I've ever heard. They have so many hits this cd could have been a four disc set. But they did what they did, well done!
B00004YKUY|4.0|This is an excellent CD that has been produced with heart and soul. As a band, Journey has been able to show their integrity by making quality music again without Steve Perry. Steve Augeri has shown he has a style of his own while still showing his respect for Steve Perry. Neal Schon once again has proven he is truley one of the best guitar players ever. Higher Place, World Gone Wild, and To Be Alive Again are as good as any songs they have ever composed. Journey is a band that is alive again and doing what they do best. If your a true fan, keep an open mind and take a listen to what they have to offer.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is worth it just for the drumming alone. Get it!

I swear to god that I'll never tuch any kind of drugs! It's a Movie you just can't forget! You will always think about it and the Score will always stay in your mind! I love this Picture I love this DVD and I love the Story and the Score! Oh my God I love it!!!!!!!
B00003CX95|5.0|This was a great movie for reasons in previous reviews, but seems to get slammed from a select few who have agendas:<br />1.  The British who claim it is 90% fiction 2.  People who think Mel Gibson is homophobic 3.  People who hate violence<br />It a Hollywood film - relax!
B00000K2SD|5.0|&quot;The Matrix&quot; is one of the best movies I have ever watched! Keanu Reeves is one of the main characters and does a great job in this movie. He leads a double life of being a computer programmer and master hacker, but finally finds his true lot in life when he finds out he is in control of not only his future, but the &quot;matrix&quot;, which controls humanity. This movie relates to a higher power and that everything has to be controlled by someone to make the world a livable place to be in.    &quot;The Matrix&quot; at times may seem to be a very serious movie, but there are times when it is funny too. I would recommend this movie to adults, because for younger childeren they might not get the plot and follow the movie as easily as older people do. You will find that there is some violence, but I guess it is average to the rest of any other movie.
068484267X|2.0|Very slow read.  I found it hard to get into because the same things kept happening to Frank, (hunger, drunk father, poor home life)but the only thing that changed was his age.  Read it in my book club and none of us really liked it.  We watched the movie and it was okay, but it skipped a lot of the story and the order of things that occurred in the book were not the same as in the movie.  The movie gave the mother more of a voice and made the viewer want to feel sorry for the father-the book did the opposite.  My opinion:  don't bother with it.
B00004TH6O|4.0|The best that guitar rock has to offer in the 21st century. Intrested in what the instrument can do in a non-time specific manner, the band runs through the 60's, 70's &amp; 80's and 90's hard rock has to offer and smashes it all to a fine pulp. But don't be fooled, it is not merely a pastiche. QOTSA is looking to express as much as name check. So if you are tired of the calculated poses found in nu metal. An album where it is short (45+ minutes) is not a disadvantge. That's what the repeat button is made for.
B0000025DV|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. It's fun, it's moving, it's well done. For ELO fans as well as music fans in general, this CD is a must own. And at this price, how can you go wrong?<br />And when you finally get it, be sure to spend at least a few Nights in the City.
B00005B36H|4.0|Not what I eagerly expected after the long wait.  While this album has it's moments, it doesn't come close to Undertow or Aenima.  Not even close.  Obviously each member of the band has enormous talent....but the songs don't give you anything to grab onto and listen to all day.  It's just not there.  I know all of you diehard TOOL fans give it 5 stars just because of who they are, but face it, this album is just a little better than Opiate, if at all.  Not that topping their last two would have been easy, but c'mon....this is the best TOOL could do after 5 years?  Did Maynard spread himself a little thin???   Only gave it four stars because compared to the other music out there, it's good.
0671015206|5.0|Most people hope to be millionaires.  They dream of it, think of it. Yet, few are aware of the the different traits that many of these share. From the perspective of the general public, it may be interesting to see how they view life styles as integral to their road to financial security. These concepts are important not just for adults, but for teens as well as they see the reason for building for future goals and dreams. Almost buried towards the end of the book are some excellent reasons why to achieve this level of financial security. According to the author,&quot;Money [is] icing on the cake of life&quot;.  The real things that matter such as &quot; good health, longevity, happiness, a loving family self- reliance, fine friends. These fascinating facts contained in this book will lead you to think, not so much whether your neighbor is a millionaire, but how are you doing with your own path.
6305718954|3.0|I have to admit to my conflict watching this movie. On the one hand, there is the quality of the movie. There is a wonderful realism in the acting and much of the script. The effects were well done. In general, I was captured and penetrated by the majority of the film. It reminded me a lot of The Third Miracle (see it, if you haven't). It was not afraid to tackle big issues and wrestle with problems in the established church, while it also recognized the world of the supernatural. However, on the other hand, I have a problem with the message behind the movie and the misrepresentation of facts. I am not against movies challenging the Church. The Church needs a good challenge; it has many problems. Rather, it is a poorly based and misleading challenge that I have quibbles about.<br />I noticed the familiarity in the words Frankie spoke early on in the movie. \\"That sounds a lot like the Gospel of Thomas,\\" I said to myself. Indeed, it was. It was an inaccurate portrayal of the Gospel. As the closing words of the film tell us, it was found in the library at Nag Hamadi. However, it was not written in \\"the language Jesus spoke\\" (Aramaic), but rather in Coptic, a form of Greek. It is not believed to be written in the first century, the century of Christ, but rather in the second, further removed than the four Gospels of the established New Testament canon. This is not to mention the content of the document itself. It is not a challenge to established religion, so much as it is a challenge to human flesh. It is a Gnostic Gospel. Gnosticism, condemned by the early ecumenical councils (for good reason), held that flesh is evil, and that salvation is the escape from the flesh. They also held that Jesus was solely divine and zero human. This early heresy (which has some followers today), as well as this document spoken of, has been rejected because of its irrationality, not because it is a conviction to the way the institution of the Church is run. Ironically, \\"stigmata\\" is an affirmation of arguably the most human aspect of Jesus, his death, which the Gospel of Thomas would deny. Of Adam, the Gospel states, \\"had he been worthy, he would not have experienced death\\" (85). Strange how the movie uses the two together.<br />At the close of the film we are told: \\"This scroll...has been claimed by scholars around the world to be the closest record we have of the words of the historical Jesus... [new screen] ...The Vatican refuses to recognize this Gospel and has described it as heresy.\\" These \\"scholars around the world\\" are few and far between. It is not merely the Vatican which describes it as heresy, but the majority of the Academy as well. The research of scholars who hold that this as the \\"closest record we have of the words of the historical Jesus\\" is not much respected by many serious scholars of such documents. If, indeed, their claim is true, then one account of Jesus' teaching goes a little something like this:<br />\\"Simon Peter said to him, 'Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life.' Jesus said, 'I myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven.'\\" (114)<br />The words that were quoted from the scroll in the movie were a pick & choose method, taking sentences from the beginning and middle and making it sound as if that were how it opened and continued throughout. But the document is a little strange and disconcerting, not having anything to do with the point of the movie. The theme dealt with in Stigmata was a genuine one, one that needs attention. However, the producers are guilty of the very thing they accuse the church of: deception and misrepresentation. I fear that many have been led astray in thinking this movie's foundation was based upon something of a true story. I don't see how an uninformed viewer could read the interpretative script at the end and conclude otherwise. It wasa good movie, but a deceptive one. If it were honest, it would've gotten 5 stars.
B00005J73X|5.0|It's not easy to put 16 years of Bon Jovi onto one CD. But Obie O'Brian (Producer) did a great job with mixing the songs. So, let's talk about the other few good things about this album:<br />Finally a Bon Jovi LIVE CD - woow! We had been waiting for that way too long. But, it's not one show, recorded on one day. That makes it so special - 15 songs from different times, recorded in different countries and places. From Japan to Canada, from Switzerland to Australia, from South Africa to the United States. All over the world...<br />Another interesting fact - the former bass player Alec John Such appears on two songs as well. <br />The only think I didn't really like - it's not a flow of songs. Because they were all recorded at different times, there is a pause between each song. Which doesn't make it a &quot;real&quot; concert experience. <br />Other then that - this album rocks! Go get it!
0875847706|5.0|This book is fantastic for anyone on a self-discouvery journey.  One should look for books like this and people like Zander for help through life.  Reading a book can't do any harm, and reading this one has done good for so many people.  As someone who personally knows Zander and the things that he has taught people, I strongly reccomend this book.
B000056K04|2.0|I fell in love with DMB's music 7+ years ago after hearing &quot;Recently&quot; and &quot;Remember Two Things&quot;. With every album they just got better! But somewhere around the time &quot;Before These Crowded Strees&quot; came out the band seemed to get caught up in the top 40 hype. The music changed from something that could carry your mind to another world on just a note, to some prefabricated form letter that was meant to do nothing more than rake in money from a bunch of fad-cow fans. &quot;Before These Crowded Strees&quot; was hit and miss in my book (the begining of the spiral down), and this album (&quot;Everyday&quot;) misses more than it hits. <br />I can't say that I won't go see them in concert simply because of this album. As much as I love (as any true DMB fan does) seeing them play live, I haven't gone since the tour after &quot;BTCS&quot; because their new fan base doesn't allow you to sit and enjoy the music. They mosh and start fights instead. <br />My recommendation: buy the early albums, find a good stereo with surround sound and close your eyes.

B000002NIW|1.0|Okay, I am a kid and this music is my life, I have every CD from Soundgarden to Rage to Sevendust to Godsmack and since everybody likes Deftones I figured I might as well buy their popular album.  After buying it I had to be stopped from burning it.  This excruciatingly long cd full of garbage is nothing but Chino Moreno whispering behind heavy guitar riffs and then screeching his lyrics in a horrible high-pitched tone.  Every song goes on and on like this and if you don't hate it because of the sound in one of the songs, how do you not get BORED through an entire CD of the same sounding songs.  If CDNOW would let me give this 0 Stars I would.  If you have any taste in music STAY AWAY FROM THIS GROUP!!
0060392886|5.0|The Dirt was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.  The content was compelling.  I laughed, I cried, I cringed, and got to know the boys of Motley Crue on a personal level.  Neil Strauss and the guys outdid themselves with this one.  I have the Crue's Authorized Biography: The First Five Years, and this book far surpasses the content and style of the former.  Even people I know who are not fans have enjoyed passages from the book...surprising due to the nature of the public's love/hate relationship with bad boys.  The highest recommendation: my MOM liked it!  Buy this book!!!!!

B000002ACR|5.0|It is hard to believe that an album of this breadth and vision did not chart well. Released in 1967, it is one of the two best Byrds albums ever ( along with The Notorious Byrd Brothers ). Its' combination of folk rock psychedelia is nothing short of mesmerizing. David Crosby is at his zenith here. His song Everybody's Been Burned is perhaps the finest Byrds composition ever. Chris Hillman emerges from nowhere with a newly found song writing ability, contributing several strong tracks. As usual Roger McGuinn's ever present 12 string brings the whole album together. This is truly a landmark album of the pschedelic era, although it seems to have maintained a freshness and has aged well.
B00005BL2A|3.0|First off, I have to say &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is the best techno workout Gore and company have submitted since &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; some ten years ago. I'm surprised it wasn't the first single taken off the album. Having said that, the rest of the album moves at the pace of a funeral procession stuck in a traffic jam. Okay, that's a slight exaggeration but Gore seems determined with this album to bury the band's reputation as pioneers of alternative dance music. Martin Gore's lyrics range from the pseudo-philosophical &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; to the oblique silliness of &quot;The Dead Of Night&quot; (where he chooses to rhyme &quot;horniest&quot; with &quot;corniest&quot;). By the way, what exactly is a &quot;Zombie room&quot;? Gahan's voice is in fine form here, although on the whole there's little for him to sink his teeth into. &quot;Dead Of Night&quot;, with it's impressive industrial rhythm is as arena-rockish as things get. As in every album since Black Celebration, Gore handles lead vocals on two slower-tempo cuts here, &quot;Comatose&quot; (which is an appropriate title given the general mood of the album) and &quot;Breathe&quot;. I'm not terribly disappointed in the album, but I'm not exactly impressed either. This is more an extension of &quot;Songs Of Faith and Devotion&quot; than the second coming of &quot;Violator&quot;...
068484267X|4.0|This is a bittersweet story about growing up without the things most of us take for granted in our everyday lives. It opened my eyes and made me realize how much worse off my life could be. This book is about a poor family that has to get over their pride and beg for food and coal and other necessities in order to survive.  Readers may get a little bored with learning more and more about the terrible life of poverty,but Frank McCourt lightens the load with the humor children can bring.
0451457994|4.0|This book is a true science fiction masterpiece. The 2001: A Space Odyssey movie directed by Stanley Kubrick is also a masterpiece, but it really fails to capture the true essence of the novel.  The main plot of the novel deals with the creation of man and the possibity of alien life forms, but my favorite subplot has to be the development of the HAL9000 computer as a character just as human as the crew of the Discovery.  This novel raises many questions about just what sets humanity apart from others; whether they are apes or sentient computers.   Every time I read this book I find some new angle to ponder. If you haven't read it yet, do so.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|First of all, if you haven't seen &quot;Akira&quot; before, STOP READING and BUY the disc already. It really is the pinnacle of Japanimation, as far as I'm concerned. The cels are dazzling, and nothing has even approached the minute detail of this film, and it was made in the late Eighties! If you HAVE seen the initial English dub released around 1990, then you are in for an interesting ride because this is a completely different film. The dialogue is not only done by new actors, but nearly every line is changed from the previous dub. One obvious change is pronuciations of the character's names: &quot;Akira&quot; isn't &quot;uh-KEE-ruh,&quot; as in the first English dub. Now, it's pronounced, &quot;AH-kee-dah,&quot; with the DAH spoken as a hard &quot;R.&quot; Kaneda isn't &quot;kah-NAY-dah,&quot; but &quot;KAH-nah-dah.&quot; It takes a bit of getting used to if you've seen the original English dub as many times as I have, but it's still a classic piece of animation that can still blow your mind every bit as much as it did in 1990. I recommend this version, although since I am still very much fond of the previous version, I would have liked it if they included the first English dub in a separate audio track. But alas, I am just grateful to see &quot;Akira&quot; back on the market so that anime fans, new and old, can continue to appreciate this master work.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have one word to say, i think, to discribe this very great album: Hypnotic!!!<br />An other very great job from Tool band! I think a lot's of rock band have to learn from TOOL...<br />It's a Chef d'oeuvre!!! It's the word!!!
0385486804|3.0|The previous reviewer takes exception to McCandless being called 'a boy' at the age of twenty-four but that's exactly what he was - an over age adolescent. I mean would a mature adult call himself 'Alexander Supertramp' and scribble emphatic one liners like 'Jack London is the Man!!' or whatever?    McCandless' self centered self righteousness and feckless indiference to consequences are characteristic of the kind of sheltered upper middle class boy he was. His behavior towards his parents can only be described as deliberately and maliciously cruel and his treatment of the various people who befriend him on his travels isn't much better, he accepts their help but gives little or nothing back. If it were not for the help of strangers he meets along the way his adventure would have ended much sooner than it did.    Oh he was idealistic I grant you, in the half baked counter-cultural way we've had to put up with since the sixties, unlevened by any touch of realism or common sense. And that of course is what killed him. Krakauer is wrong, McCandless wasn't doing 'all right' he was living hand to mouth with no margin of safety at all. If our ancestors had been so improvident the human species would have expired millions of years ago.    McCandless' basic flaw was he didn't take the Wilderness seriously, not seriously enough to adequately prepare himself by studying survival techniques, not seriously enough to dedicate himself to building up a store of food to fall back on, or even thoroughly scout his territory. He was apparently completely unaware of cabins, a ranger station and even a way to cross the flooded river all of which could be found within a six mile radius of his bus. What the heck was he doing all those months? Reading apparently and scribbling callow enthusiasms on every available surface under the impression he was being profound. What he was *not* doing was exploring his territory, locating promising food sources or preparing for emergencies - even afterhe discovered the flooded river blocking his intended trail out.     His fecklessness killed him, which is a pity he was young after all and it is sad he should die of his youthful follies.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman The Movie is still the best superhero movie to date.     Thank the director, Richard Donner, for maintaining closely to the comic book while keeping the interaction between a super alien and humans as real as possible. Also for introducing us to then newcomer Christopher Reeve. Reeve's portrayal of a humble, quirky, klutzy Clark Kent and dynamic, powerful, might makes right \\"man of steel\\" is so right on. Perfect casting.     The music provided us with a nice feel for the movie. An excellent soundtrack and arguably the best one to date. Who doesn't recognize the famous opening Superman theme, young or old? The Superman/Lois Lane love theme \\"Can You Read My Mind\\" showing them flying through the night sky was my favorite. Damn good job for a 1978 film.    Superman the Movie is a film that fills you with a yearning to be like it's main character. Someone to look up to who is powerful, down to earth and, well... super. It is a very well made movie and even more so now with it's new features and deleted scenes on DVD. \\"The Gauntlet\\" scene is incredible. I love the screen tests.    Superman the Movie was and is still the king of superhero movies.
0060392886|5.0|Most people know that Motley Crue was/is a crazy band. We know the stories of them dating playboy playmates, getting crazy with Ozzy Osbourne and doing crazy drugs. But, in The Dirt, you get all the nasty, gutrenching information on one of the greatest Rock N Roll bands to ever walk this earth.  The book covers each of the band members childhood.  To the suprising story of Vince Neil growing up on Compton, CA and already getting hot chicks at age 16, to Nikki's very strange and sad childhood.   The book covers the Crue's early days of partying, which should warn people to be get ready to be shocked, amused, grossed out, stunned and freaked out.   The book also captures each of the band members honesty. Neil Strauss not only did a great job of writing, but also getting each band member to open up.  The chapater on Vince losing his daughter was very tough to read. I must admit, I got emotional.  The stories about all the girls is crazy and fun to read. It makes you feel want to be one of the guy's so much, but then you read about how these guys have sufferd in life as well. Not just with heavy drug use, but losing money and family. At the end of the book, you will most likely take a deep breath and say...Wow! I cannot believe these guys lived through all this. Weather your a Motley Crue fan or even a Rock N Roll fan for that matter, this book is a must read. I always thought only a movie and not a book could blow me away, but I was very wrong after I read &quot;The Dirt&quot;
6305910103|4.0|Ricardo Montalban made this movie for me. He played Khan, a severely revenge minded, slightly psychotic individual hellbent on destroying his enemy/nemesis, James T. Kirk. Almost, literally, playing the part of Captain Ahab from the classic tale, \\"Moby Dick\\", who is obsessed with destroying the white whale (Kirk). Montalban's great performance, I felt, helped push the other lead actors to perform to their fullest potential.     Shatner did a great job even though, he actually never acted in the same room with Momtalban. It was his best performance of all the Star Trek films.     The dialogue between all the characters, especially all the classic literature quotes, was written and performed beautifully. \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\\", an amazing line and delivered beautifully by Moltalban as he blasts the Enterprise with phasers.    The death of a prominent Star Trek character at the end of the film was definitely a surprise when the film first aired. It added a lot to the feel of the story.     The film had a great story line and non stop action between two bitter rivals. I do recommend this film to all, Trekkies or not.

B00004U30D|5.0|American Beauty is a film that every high school teenager should see. It depicts what most teens are going through, though they might take it to the extreme, it does show how many are feeling. American Beauty is also a movie that every middle aged adult should see. I am sure many people go through much of the same things that both parents go through. Again, it might go to the extreme, but that is what  makes this movie worth watching. many themes come through in this story, people dealing with infedelity, homofobia, and going through a mid-life crisis. These are all things that most people deal with at some point in their lives. So again this is a great movie and you should see it....its a 5 star flick..in my opinion!
1573225517|3.0|After seeing the movie (which, BTW, I thought was merely okay) I found that it had originally been a book, and moreover, the book was considered far better. It wasn't.  There is one thing this book is full of: little life lessons. I can't imagine anyone picking this thing up and not getting to thinking about onesself. It has very light prose and easy dialogue--the themes are mature, but anyone with an IQ over 80 could read it--you'd almost think this thing were written for a movie. Its a quick read, but most of the themes and important dialogues are in the movie. Save yourself the cash and time.
B00005B36H|2.0|Don't buy this if you are expecting something like the earlier albums. If you liked Perfect Circle (which I didn't) then this album is for you. This album has none of the raw power that previous Tool albums were based on. This is more of a melodic mellow pop-style album. Think of Metallica selling out and how bad there music became and you'll get the idea. I'm not saying that Tool is selling out but this album is not the Tool that I loved for so many years.
B00001W0G6|4.0|After having been introduced to Fellini by the semi-intellectual comic figure, Arne And, I felt an urgent need to become acquainted with his works. The father of one of my ex girl friends was the owner of a Laser Disc copy of Satyricon and I arranged that she and I could watch it together one night. I watched it intensely, but it seemed that none of us understood what it really was about. As a matter of fact we agreed that this film was just another strange art movie with an unintelligible message. She was through with Fellini, but I decided to give it another shot. I went to the local record shop and ordered La Dolce Vita. More than a month afterwards I collected the film and decided to spend my Friday night watching it. This film was a three-hour marathon, but none the less it really thrilled me greatly. <br />It is about the young writer/journalist Marcello Rubin who - in his search for a story - wanders disoriented around between the glamorous life of the well-heeled and ordinary people who's greatest wish is to belong to the group that is being written about in the magazines. Marcello is highly esteemed by all layers in the society, but he has a difficult time being a set of different persons. He is looking for the ultimate answer but he grows to despise the fake glamorous world and the chosen souls of the intellectuals, who believe that they have found freedom. When the impulsive young, blond actress shows up he begins to understand that simple pureness and truth are the qualities he has been searching for, and this is now what he crave for.<br />Fellini's La Dolce Vita is a lesson in life, and should be watched by anyone.

The chapater on Vince losing his daughter was very tough to read. I must admit, I got emotional.  The stories about all the girls is crazy and fun to read. It makes you feel want to be one of the guy's so much, but then you read about how these guys have sufferd in life as well. Not just with heavy drug use, but losing money and family. At the end of the book, you will most likely take a deep breath and say...Wow! I cannot believe these guys lived through all this. Weather your a Motley Crue fan or even a Rock N Roll fan for that matter, this book is a must read. I always thought only a movie and not a book could blow me away, but I was very wrong after I read &quot;The Dirt&quot;
B000002GB9|5.0|People have forgotten Styx's long history of interesting music like this. The band has been associated with prom ballads like Babe but this is typical of all releases through Pieces of Eight. The band sounds almost Beatlish in their artsy but catchy sound. They never tried to be pure pop or excrutiatingly long winded, and this is the best of what they strove for
B00003CWTI|2.0|When I read the...s Editorial Review of Magnolia, all I could think was...&quot;Oh, pleeeese!&quot;<br />Ever since the &quot;critical acclaim\\" of Altman's tedious Nashville, attempts have been made to make weave-their-stories-together films. Sometimes they work (e.g., Ragtime); this time it didn't - despite all the awards this jumble received. Here's the line-up: (a) a divorced, lonely cop, (b) a 10-year-old punk thief, (c) a greasy misogynist who runs seduction seminars, (d) a dying child molester, (e) a quiz show kid with an oppresive dad, (f) a fired ne'er-do-well homosexual, (g) a cocaine-snorting, junkie bimbo, and (h) a terminally ill patient, (i) his male nurse, and (j) his hysterical, strug out 30-years-younger wife. All but (a) and (e) have something in common: every third word they utter is &quot;F***.\\"  It's long, stupid, dark, and vulgar. Writer/Director Anderson must have a pretty awful view of this world of ours.<br />There ARE, you should know, a ton of goodies and extras, plus the best packaging job ever for a DVD -- then again, you can sprinkle perfume on a goat, and it doesn't change the essence of things....
B000002WYT|5.0|No matter who you are you are going to love this album. If youve ever had a cd that you had to skip over most of the songs to find a good one, then youll greatly enjoy this cd. Every song is outstanding. Some of my favorites: lie on our graves, so much to say, say goodbye, tripping billies, and of course crash. Go buy it now.
078062369X|5.0|It is amazing that Marvel did such a wonderful job bringing this character to the silver screen. The cinematography is great, the action sequences are amazing and Wesly Snipes was a perfect choice to play Blade, the half-human, half-vampire hero of the film. Get the DVD and you get to see the alternate ending which is pretty cool.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Well as many have waxed poetic about the DM coming of age I'll spare you.  I'm a very long time Mode fan and was not surprised to see them experiment.  This one is a bit of a departure in some ways, but not so much that you wont recognize them.  If you're looking for upbeat synth pop you will find little here.  This does not mean the CD is without merit.  It's not your typical DM album so don't go there unless your willing to give it a listen or three.<br />Once you do, it will start to absorb and take hold and then you'll find yourself playing it over and over again.  The long and short of it is, if you're a real fan you will love it because it's them, if you just sort of like them I wouldn't pick this one up.  I'm not the most impartial person though as they could pretty much fart to a synthesizer and I'd pick up the CD and think it was great.  The truth is there is more than meets the ear with this one and if you give it an extra listen you'll find it.
B000002HH2|5.0|..And that's saying something nowadays. I still love listening to this album, every song on it is different and equally engaging. &quot;Isobel&quot; is my favorite, an incredible tune. You can't go wrong buying this CD.
B00005BL2A|3.0|Monotone.  This is the one word that best describes \\"Exciter.\\"  It's not that each song sounds like all the others, but I mean that within each song, there is not enough contrast between the verse and the chorus.  Depeche Mode seems to betray their classic roots which so endeared me to the band's past work, for on this album I felt as if I was waiting for crescendos that never climaxed.  All too many times I feel that they never released the energy that seems integrated into their innovative style, and it left me wondering what they were saving it for and why.<br />Track four, entitled \\"When the Body Speaks,\\" contains this underlying hum that overshadows the beauty in Dave Gahan's voice, although I have gotten used to the song the more I listened to it.  And I guess with \\"Breathe,\\" the tenth track, that the band offers the title as a suggestion of things to do that will help a listener stomach the unbearable lyrics.  This is the worst song on the album, one I don't think I'll ever get used to.  Some songs aren't very \\"exciting,\\" however, the album does have its gems that make it a worthwhile buy.  \\"Dream On,\\" the single that leads off, is catchy and interesting, but there's better as one listens on.  Although \\"Shine\\" is terrific, my favorite song is \\"Free Love.\\"
6304083769|5.0|If you like Pokepuke, then don't bother buying this. Ghost in the Shell is an original, thought-provoking work of art. It is probably one of the best Anime films ever made. The fantastic story coupled with the amazing visuals will blow you away.
B00000HZFH|5.0|as with most albums, &quot;keep it like a secret&quot; does not at first strike you as an album that will suck you in and have you listening to it over and over again until the disc is so messed up that you have to buy a new copy. but after just a few listens, the rest of your collection will begin to gather dust and your cd player will have a new permanent resident. the sheer musical talent displayed throughout the album is incredible...guitars layered upon guitars upon guitars (which still manage to be subtle and not overpowering) and rythms that will leave the songs engraved in your brain.<br />cheers to doug and the rest of the guys in the band for creating something that is increasingly lacking in today's world....real music.
0804115613|4.0|I got this book form my English teacher.  She chose it for me for a reading assignment. I saw it was very thick and I didn't want to read it.  When I began to read this book I liked it more and more.  The more I read it the less and less I wanted to put it down.  As I read this book I wanted to find out more and I never wanted to put it down.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fiction.  I liked it because it had suspense and it kept going back and forth and the more I would read I would find surprises in the book I didn't think I would ever find out.  But I read and there it was, an answer to a question I had during the middle of the book, I found in the end.  I liked it and I think you will too.<br />Much Luv, Sterling
0553260111|5.0|The Bourne Identity is the only Ludlum book I have read and boy was I impressed. From the get go (literally the first paragraph) Ludlum grabs your attention with his excellent story telling ability.<br />Jason Bourne doesn't know who he is yet. As he slowly regains parts of his memory he finds confusion, espionage and action around every corner. His journey takes him all over the world in an attempt to work out his own personal riddle.<br />As you turn the pages faster and faster towards the climatic end, you almost feel cheated that the book has roller coastered too fast.<br />A suspensful, action packed novel that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend it and hope you like it too!

B00004U30D|4.0|And you thought your family was crazy, the family in the movie &quot;American Beauty&quot; puts all others to shame. I have never seen such a lack of respect in a family establishment as has been presented in this movie. But maybe it is the complete disregard for all standard family values that makes this flick so damn good! Issues such as infidelity, homophobia, petafiles, premarital relations, and dilusional parents are addressed in this film with the notion that life as a teen ager is dark and cynical. I loved the way the father was so sarcastic to the mother and did not take any of her bull. His character made such a one eighty it was unrealistic (but hey thats a movie for you) and, his charactor, dispite being the narrator, was the most importat character. He initiated the conflict between himself and his daughter Jainie, and he continued the upserd relationship with his wife. I really admire him for his performance in the office with his boss where he demanded a years pay for doing nothing. This movie made all our families look like saints. I loved it!
0767827791|2.0|I will admit that this film does a good job of depicting a painfully provincial midwestern town in the 50's -- with everyone busy being violently swell.  But it fails to really take flight.  The music has horrible melodramatic spikes, the story suffers with implausable character development, and is frankly painful to watch.  It is really a pity this film took time from Mr. Holden's life; that he could have used making a better picture.  If you must see it, see it on a rental basis. Baby.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The performances in this movie are outstanding, but Jeff Daniels is clearly the stand-out in his portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain. The late Richard Jordan is terrific as Louis Armistead, and Tom Berenger as James Longstreet is excellent. Solid acting is the standard here. Each moment of battle is guaranteed to leave you on the edge of your seat, as the action is fast and furious. The scenes between Armistead (Jordan) and Longstreet (Berenger) bring to life the depth of the torture Armistead felt at having to face his best friend, Union General Winfield Hancock on the battlefield. The scene in which Longstreet explains what will happen to George Pickett's division as it marches to the Union lines leaves you with a sense of anguish for the Confederate troops. There is really no accurate way to convey the horror of the three days at Gettysburg, but this picture comes close.
0812550706|5.0|very good book that make you think
B00003CXV4|5.0|I loved this movie. I cried almost the entire time at the theater. If you like a good mushy movie, you'll love this one. It's the perfect movie for tear-jerk lovers. But first stop by the store and get some kleenex PS My husband hated it so invite the girls over!
B00003W8NM|5.0|A revolutionary film. Talented actors, great music, and the most profound characters and plot.  Yet no award.  No recognition.  Why?   Fight Club is very unique.   However introspective it is, it leaves the viewer feeling....&quot;bad&quot;.  Its murky lighting and brutal violence draws the viewer in for a better look, only to see the most curious and amazing thing that is evil and horrible.   Yet all of this is true.  One can learn much from the themes instilled in 'Fight Club'. Buy this DVD, or buy this VHS, or watch this movie over and over again.  It will change everything for you.
B000002KBA|5.0|This is simply the best rock album ever made. Bar none. Never before have I heard a rock band when every member was so musically talented. In my opinion, Ritchie Blackmore is the one and only maverick guitar player and the best in the world ability wise. Ian Gillan is one of the best rock singers I have ever heard with his ability to go from a soft murmur to a glass-shattering scream. Roger Glover and Ian Paicce are both very talented musicians and finally, Jon Lord's keyboard skills I think are unsurpassed. In Rock is so good it hurts from the supercharged mayhem of Speed King to the thumping, dinosaur rock of Black Night. This album shows what Deep Purple are really capable of and I reckon if you're not into 70's rock then this might just convert you...
6304510861|4.0|That so many people have so many divergent views of the film means, to me, that this is a well-done film, whether everyone appreciates it or not...<br />Were the scences alternate realities or multiple realities? Were the videotapes flashes of reality and/or dreamed fantasy? Where the people actual persons or characters (re)invinted in the mind of Fred? Was Mystery Man a stanger or evil incarnate that each of the key characters had invited into their lives? Was that the voice of Fred on the intercom at the beginning of the film, as we are lead to believe by the film's end, or was it the voice of Mr Eddy (whom I think of as Mr. Rage). Or all of the above??<br />This is a very intense and distrubing film, which I needed to see more than once before I could let go and watch the film &quot;unfold,&quot; pun intended. It was then that I better appreciated how the use of color, down to the changing shades of nail polish, clued the viewer.
B000002LMM|5.0|Of course, I would never have bought this CD if I weren't a Twin Peaks fan. But it must have virtues beyond that. I play it again and again, especially late at night, in the car. More to the point. Badalamenti juxtaposes and recomposes two musical genres: '60s girl groups and West Coast jazz. Nobody can listen to \\"The Nightingale\\" without thinking of \\"Soldier Boy\\" by the Shirelles. But Julee Cruise has the skill (?) to sing selected notes just a little sharp or flat--like Laura Nyro, except that the effect is spooky, not down-home. As for jazz, listen to some of the clarinet licks on \\"Audrey's Dance\\" and compare them to Jimmy Giuffre's on his Thesis album. Two essential cuts are missing from this CD: the song that James, Maddie, and Donna compose and perform for their own amusement; and \\"Rockin' Back Inside my Heart,\\" which Julee Cruise performs on her [[ASIN:B000002LH4 Floating Into the Night]] album.
B00003CXRM|5.0|If musicals must be in fashion again  (e.g., *Moulin Rouge*, *Chicago*), I'd much prefer that they be more like the Coen Brothers'  *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*  It's  \\"based on the Odyssey\\", but don't take that too seriously.  It's more an homage to Preston Sturges movies  (this movie's title references the film idea by the bleeding-heart director in  *Sullivan's Travels*).  The three principals  (George Clooney, John Turturro, and that other guy)  are very funny.  Clooney is especially a revelation, delivering lines like  \\"You're about as dumb as a bag of hammers\\"  with the relish of a man who's feasting on Lobster Neuberg after having not eaten for days.  We have the brilliant script by the Coens to thank for it.  Oh, and the music's pretty good, too.  Get the movie; then get the soundtrack.
0553208845|5.0|SIDDHARTHA is an amazing story about a man in search of perfection.  This book is riddled with philisophical ideas and lessons.  I am thrilled that I found this book, and I think anyone who is searching should read Siddhartha.
0060934913|3.0|This is a funny and revealing look at the restaurant business from a first-hand perspective.  Readers who have spent a summer as a dishwasher or prep cook will surely recognize the world Bourdain describes.  But while the anecdotes in the book are fun and it reads quickly, the author comes off as quite arrogant and a bit of a jerk at times, which takes some of the enjoyment out of things.  If you order your steak well-done, enjoy chicken from time to time, or are a vegetarian, prepare to be insulted.  And while the tough-as-nails image Bourdain paints of himself may be accurate, it's also kind of overbearing after a while.  The coarse tone is a bit over the top, which, though probably his intent, gets stale toward the end.  All in all, an entertaining behind-the-scenes tale, though it certainly doesn't make me long for my days as a prep cook.
078322706X|3.0|This is a good story, for a 15 min short or a 90 min HBO movie. Definitely not for 3 hours. Hopkins and Pitt make a great acting. The problem in this film is that the director, Martin Brest, is also the producer. So it lacks of any, the most minimal empathy with the spectator. If you haven't see it, don't waste your time.
630575067X|4.0|I thought the book was better at explaining and telling the story.  However, it does add another dimension when you see what Lucas can put on the screen.  Very entertaining.
0805062971|5.0|This is what those new age self-help books don't teach you. They don't REALLY show you how screwed up the world is with you trapped in the middle. Let Tyler Durden show you why your life is so screwed up. Is it because we've become obsessed with a corporate-infused lifestyle? Part of it. Is it because people have some sort of sick desperation in their lives? Yes. Is it because corporations have taken over our lives? Yes. Is it because people are scared to prove they're alive? Definately.<br />The plot basically revolves around an insomniac. Our unnamed protagonist goes to support groups to cure his insomnia, until another faker, a woman named Marla, begins faking her way through these groups. After his condo was blown up, he goes to live with Tyler, a man he met on a nude beach. Tyler's only request is that the two of them start a fight. When fight club becomes boring, Tyler decides to take it up, and fight club becomes Project Mayhem. <br />If you've seen the movie, you need to read the book. While the movie mainly focuses on the fighting, the book goes into a lot more detail about project mayhem. The movie probably skips about a third of the book. Plus, the book explains the true definition of what a space monkey is, the formula for homemade napalm, and the real secret formula for Tyler's soap. Only after you've read the book and viewed the key scenes in the movie does the philosophy of Mr. Durden become clear. Even if you think you know the movie, read the book. The first rule of fight club may be that you don't talk about fight club, but you will after reading the book.
B00003CXQY|5.0|Disney does it again, a movie that is not only entertaining for the kids but for the adults as well.  I loved this movie!
0767903862|5.0|First I must say, I was not a big fan of Bill Bryson.  I was very disappointed in &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;, so I bought this book with some reservations.  I have made five trips to Australia before I read the book and have visited all the states and territories.  Mr. Bryson got it right this time!  He distilled Australia and it's people down to the true essence.  If you are thinking about visiting Australia for the first time, forget the tour guides and READ THIS BOOK!  If you have already been to &quot;Oz&quot;, read this book and you will understand why you loved it.
0944379044|5.0|I have great interest in WWII and the man who made it all happen. This book provided me an indepth look in to the mind of that person. It always amazed me how one man's idelogy can bring so much destruction to the entire world. Nothing positive can be said about Hitler nor did he do any constructive work in his entire life. What ever he thought about, where ever he laid his eyes on, where ever he walked he only brought destruction to the lives and property to that place. For this reason Hitler remains the true personification of pure Evil.
0789723107|3.0|As many reviewers have said so far, this book is great for beginners. I agree. But if you already know most of the &quot;DOs&quot; and &quot;DONTs&quot; of web usability, you will get little more from this book. I highly reccomend &quot;Designing Web Usability&quot; by Jakob Nielsen as a great read for designers of any ability level. It's an easy read and covers everything, inlcuding just about everything in this book.
0679731369|5.0|This idea-driven novel is filled with brilliant observations, especially in the later chapters, that make me want to read Flaubert. But, in my opinion, the brilliance of these observations is not credibly attributable to personality of the narrator or the power of his trauma. As a result, the essayist Julian Barnes, as well as extensive comments from Flaubert (\\"With me, friendship is like the camel: once started, there is no way of stopping it.\\")  seemed to carry the narrative load. Regardless, this is a very entertaining book that broadened this reader's horizons. Highly recommended.
B00005J73X|4.0|This cd has been a major hit in the Uk where it goto to number 2 in the album charts(stopped only by REM, Reveal which i also own) and its esy to see why.  Over the years Bon Jovi have built up a great catalogue of songs that are adored by millions, so they have given the fans what they wanted... a live album.  There are great tracks on this album like Its My Life, One Wild Night, Just Older, Runaway and Livin On a Prayer.  This is a must have by any fan of Bon Jovi
6305327041|5.0|This is a great film.  Critics that rip this one apart either went in with unreasonable expectations, had the actors typecasted, or they're just plain blind.  Every detail is geared to amuse...from Ted's swagger and smug demeanor that slips into unbridled rage and eventually comes very close to the edge of insanity, to the strange yet alluring peeks into the lives of many odd characters, this film has it all.  Don't go into it with any expectations whatsoever -- as with life, that's bound to leave you disapointed.  Just let go and enjoy -- you'll not be able to remember when the last time was that you laughed so hard.
0780626494|5.0|This movie was very heartwarming.  The whole family enjoyed it.  It was done innocently, and had alot of surprises.  I thought Brendan Fraser was very good in this movie, but my favorite was Christopher Walken.  I wish that there were people as innocent and unassuming as Brendan Fraser's character.  I think it was very good for preteen girls to see what a &quot;nice guy&quot; is, since most movies nowadays play up the &quot;bad boy&quot; image.  Chivalry is not dead.  This movie is great!
B000024D4R|5.0|This saying from Anifarm Farm is very much applicable to Animals (the album) compared with Animals (the band). Outshone only by Wish you were Here, Animals is a rare diamond that keeps on shining in the world of artistic (pop) music. Animals was the first Pink Floyd album (CD's were still far in the future) I bought. It got me hooked forever. <br />Songs like Dogs, Pigs and Sheep are outstanding compositions that offer you a very dark view on mankind. Waters and his companions don't show much faith in their fellow man and what drives them. Besides great music Animals is also a strong political and social statement whether you agree with their views or not.<br />Pink Floyd grew from the best psychedelic band to one of the greatest rock bands with music you have to get used to. If you have never listened to one of their records Animals is a good one to start with. It contains everything that makes Pink Floyd the great band and the rare gem in the musical world it still is after all those years.
630587493X|1.0|This movie was a TOTAL drag!  It will not keep your kids interested at all!  The story line was much to involved, and even I had a hard time staying awake for the whole movie.  It is very depressing.  If you have kids that are under 13, don't buy this movie, and expect them to hang around the popcorn.  Eventhough there is a &quot;moral&quot; to the story, kids will not wait around for the whole movie to &quot;get it&quot;.  Do not recommend this movie for anyone under 20, and even us oldtimers thought it was too heavy.  I walked away from seeing this with a &quot;wasted my money&quot; feeling.
B00003CXAT|5.0|I remember the first day I saw Jurassic Park, the line was very long and the theatre very packed. I ended up seeing my favorite movie of all time. The characters were great, and ofcourse the dinosaurs were the made out of the some of the greatest most unbelievably believable special effects ever created. <br />The T-rex, velociraptors, brachiosaurus', parasaurolophaus', the spitter, triceratops, were all amazing! The film for me is every bit as good as Spielberg's Jaws and better. It's a GRAND motion picture with terrifying creatures, aswell as pleasant creatures.  I usually say that every scene in the film is my favorite, that's why it's my favorite movie.
B00005B36H|5.0|AWESOME CD, and for the record this is Tool's 4th album, not including the live album.  This album is very clean and loud.  This album should be played very loud.  Only one weird track on it with guy talking about aliens, heheheheh very nice.  If u dont understand it, then you should havent it.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is probably the only feel good movie to ever risk a downbeat ending - and get away with it as well! George Roy Hill's first teaming with the appealing Newman-Redford double act (the 2nd being Best Picture Oscar winner The Sting) is an unpretentious, self-effacing Western with a likeable nudge-and-wink style that only enhances the film's already high charisma factor. The pretty much plotless tale of Butch and Sundance after the final days of their \\"Hole in the Wall\\" gang, takes the friends from blowing up bank trains in the West and mid-West to hitting peasant banks in Bolivia before an ill-fated and hopeless attempt to go straight. Newman and Redford are superb, playing off each other with easy and familiar chemistry and blessed with a sparkling script that effectively invents the \\"buddy movie\\" concept a full decade and a half before it would flower into a dominant sub-genre through films like 48Hrs and Lethal Weapon. Newman in particular - as Butch - turns on the appeal big-time as the charmed bandit whose reputation is decidedly more dangerous than he actually is. The scene where the two are faced with the rather difficult choice of a determined posse behind them or a sheer cliff drop - into an intimidatingly small patch of river - in front, is typical of the chemistry at work. Reluctant to take the leap despite Newman's rational breakdown of the better odds of that choice, Redford finally reveals embarrassingly that he can't swim. Butch bursts out laughing: \\"Are you crazy???? The fall will probably kill you anyway!\\" Redford plays straight man in the banter with suitable conviction - once in a while letting us in on the fact that he knows comedy is afoot (such as when Butch reveals he's never actually killed anyone and Redford says: \\"You've picked a great time to share this information.\\") Highly entertaining with a hint of surprisingly serious existential meditation as well - this was the late `60s after all!). The last half of the movie is decidedly more preoccupied with their place in the world and - unexpectedly echoing Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch - they, the girl (who leaves them to return home) and you begin to realise that these are men who have outlived their time. Their horses replaced by bicycles and cars; the frontier society a thing of the past as the magic and culture of the East permeates a closing frontier. The ride - while amiable - is at an end. And Bolivia is a poor substitute for the home that no longer exists. They - like the Bunch - accept they have a date with destiny. However you choose to enjoy it though, any movie with five indisputably classic scenes (the knife fight; the train bombing; the bicycle ride; the cliff jump; the genre-defining ending) earns its way into any credible film collection on that alone. That the overall package is satisfyingly ironic - but genre-aware enough to deliver the goods conventionally as well - makes it a gem. The inspiration for the forgettable short-lived Western TV series Alias Smith and Jones, the title and spirit of which was shamelessly swiped from this amiable Newman-Redford vehicle.
0140288503|5.0|This book captured me in its great storyline and detailed charecters.  I just couldn't put it down, no matter how hard I tried to do my homework.  The emotions of the characters make you feel like you are almost there and you are fighting the battle with these men.  It amazes me how one man can write a book so great and interesting.  it has caused me to go into an almost craze learning about this conflict. You have to read this book.
6302799066|5.0|Dr. Strangelove gets humor out of everything possible. The opening credits (An in-flight refueling of a B-52 and KC-135), is the parody of a porno flick, right down to the use of the theme \\"Try a little tenderness\\". The names of the targets assigned to the B-52 crew include Laputa (The fictional kingdom in Gulliver's Travels, though I haven't read the book) and Coatloss (Self-explanatory). The battle for Burpelson Air Force Base is waged in front of a sign with the SAC motto \\"Peace is our Profession\\" on it. Also, funny are General \\"Buck\\" Turgidson's lines (\\"I think we should hold off judgment until the facts are in\\", \\"It's not fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip-up!\\", \\"General Ripper has already invalidated that policy!\\", \\"It appears that General Ripper has exceeded his authority\\" \\"Gee I wish we had one of them Doomsday machines!\\"). <br />Then of course, there are some memorable scenes that must not be forgotten.  The phone call between wimpy President Merkin Muffely and Soviet Premier Kissoff (\\"A man of the people, but also a man...\\"), General Ripper's obsession with purity of essence and our natural fluids, Colonel Bat Guano's obsession with deviated preverts, the survival-kit contents check (Which includes chewing gum, lipsticks, nylon-stockings and a miniature Russian phrase book/bible), Major Kong's riding of the Hydrogen Bomb to oblivion and Dr. Strangelove describing the 10 females for every male ratio in the underground mineshafts, the Doctor exclaiming \\"There'd be much time and little to do\\". Then the Doomsday machine goes off to the happy themes of Vera Lynn's \\"We'll meet again\\". <br />Okay, so I just gave away half the plot. But I have watched this film 100 million times and I still like it. You will too.
B000002MNR|5.0|I can't believe the reviewer, below, who calls this a snoozer.  It's one of my favourite MK recordings.  I also strongly recommend all of the movies from which these songs come -- Local Hero, Cal, and Last Exit -- all moving, in their own ways, and beautifully captured by the music provided by MK.
0385501560|5.0|Except for Palahnuik's Survivor, Choke is my 2nd favorite book.  Extremely funny, wonderful plot, wonderful comments on life.  Just doesn't have the memorable one-liners of Fight Club and Survivor.
0679720200|5.0|After reading &quot;A Happy Death,&quot; Camus's first attempt at The Stranger, I've come to appreciate this book much more. The narrative style is much more effective for Camus in developing themes of personal alienation, as it was for &quot;The Fall.&quot; Also, I've found The Stranger to be more Kafka influenced, and the parallels between Joseph K. and Mersault are very apparent -- its clear that the model of K. was used to clarify the position of Camus's absurd hero.<br />This book is not really a portrait of atheism, as some say. Its more a description of man's struggle with his own superfluity and his final reconciliation with his indifferent universe. Mersault is not a contemptible man: he is a rational man, only even he does not realize why. Through him we are meant to explore the distant vegetation of the absurd man, the climate of his universe, not its details.<br />Not a somber novel; a beautiful one if read correctly. One of the greatest books ever written.
B00003CXE7|2.0|I must admit that I really liked this movie the first time I saw it on the big screen. I liked it so much that I saw it again. I bought the DVD when it was released way back when. I popped the DVD in the other day to watch it again and I could not watch more than 20 minutes of it.<br /><br />The opening battle scene is impressive and exciting along with the excellent score. But the dialogue was too much (or too little) -- corny, pretentious, SHALLOW, and outright ridiculous. Every word that Maximus says is sooo politically correct and he's so gooder than good. Every line that Commodus utters is so nefarious (in the shallowest of ways) and he's presented as the epitome of evil. But the character development doesn't cut it -- like the 95% of all movies made today. Watch the movie. These guys sit around and try to say the most meaningful and insightful things in as few lines as possible. But it doesn't mean anything. The scenes involving the two senators talking about the games and any conversation between Commodus and Lucilla are perfect examples. They try to pass these conversations off as deep and revealing, but they make me gag over how stupid they are. I noticed these things when I watched it the first time, but I overlooked them because I wanted to enjoy the movie and not critique it too much. I can't do that anymore. It's not in my nature.<br /><br />The special effects are so overdone. They're impressive in the fakest sense. I watched Spartacus again before I watched Gladiator again, and there is no comparison. Gladiator ripped off so much from Spartacus, but the result is so cheesey. Spartacus took its time to develop the characters while Gladiator just introduced some traits and assumed that the audience would accept the rest--I don't think so. Spartacus is complex and straightforward at the same time. Lawrence Olivier, Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons, and the rest of the cast were excellent. There were good good guys, mean good guys, so-so guys that were both good and bad (Peter Ustinov's Batiatus), and bad guys that were still somewhat good if you understood them (Lawrence Olivier's Crassus). I could go on and on. Watch the movie. The end scene between Olivier and Simmons is worth the price alone -- beautiful acting and moving drama. Then watch Gladiator -- MERCY!and bad (Peter Ustinov's Batiatus), and bad guys that were still somewhat good if you understood them (Lawrence Olivier's Crassus). I could go on and on. Watch the movie. The end scene between Olivier and Simmons is worth the price alone -- beautiful acting and moving drama. Then watch Gladiator -- MERCY!
B00004XONN|5.0|I've read a lot of comments like &quot;this album reaches deep inside the human condition, and describes the pain of everyday life.&quot; Please. We're not listening to Morrissey here. It's not whiney or self-involved. The lyrics are often nonsensical, and I take issue with people who assume they understand what they mean. Like most great art, you find your own perspective in this album as much as anything else. Regardless, Kid A has a depth, a humor, an artistry, and a *beauty* unlike any other release in recent memory. The textures are subtle, the shadings are supple, and the use of space is astonishing. Overall, an amazingly original release.
B00003CXP1|4.0|This movie was EXTREMELY dark, gritty, scary, disgusting and yet I could not look away!<br />This is just not some movie about drug addicts.  It's about how things in our every day lives can be a drug...  sex, power, food, money, social acceptance, and even television.<br />I cannot say enough about ALL of the perfomances in the movie.  ESPECIALLY ELLEN BURSTYN! She was so awesome in this movie and is probably the best thing I 've seen her in.<br />Marlon Wayans is also a big surprise in the movie and really brought the character of Ty to life. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly also turn in fine performances although it is hard to feel any pity for either of them.<br />The sound, lighting, direction, and basically all of the effects in the movie are haunting.<br />This DVD has some really nice features and is well put together. \\"The Requiem\\" scene in the movie is brutally graphic.  This film is certainly not for everyone...  but I enjoyed it.
B000002J1Y|5.0|To all the people who may have a negative opinion about this album;you should reevaluate just how important Yes really was in the annuls of rock music. Just for the live versions of \\"Perpetual Change\\" and \\"Your's Is No Disgrace\\" is worth the price. !This is the one to own if you only want one Yes album.
B00000FZQ8|4.0|...With the exception of the terribly dated vocal soundtrack (I found myself fast forwarding through Joan Baez's insufferable wailing; however the instrumental portions of the soundtrack are very appropriate and seem to highlight the absolute isolation of space), this remains one of the finest Science Fiction films I've ever seen.<br />I first viewed this film in theatres during its original release when I was only 9 years old, and have never forgotten this film as one of my favorites growing up.  Of course, not having seen this film in nearly 20 years, I expected it to be terribly dated with horrendous &quot;pre-computer animation&quot; special effects.  Was I ever wrong!  The special effects have held up well, (even my 10 year old daughter was amazed at how good they were for such an &quot;old, old film&quot;).  <br />Finally, Bruce Dern's performance (Lowell) in this film is absolutely amazing.  He plays the part of a tree-hugging botanist in a society where trees and plant life are no longer essential for continued life on Earth.  His passion for his job bounces off the deaf ears of his shipmates who only want to blow up the forests they're carrying and head home for good.  In the end, Lowell emerges from his despondant despair to save the last forest from extinction, but only at the price of the lives of his shipmates.  The remainder of the movie centers around Lowell's solitude, his interaction with his forest and the three service droids who make up his new family.  During this time, the guilt associated with the murders he has committed gnaws away at Lowell's soul exposing him to be a character of many varying depths.  Kudos to Bruce Dern for one of his finest performances ever.<br />Watch this movie if you can.  It'll be worth it (just be ready for the remote when Joan Baez starts wailing about sunshine, children dancing in the sun, trees, and world harmony...  EEEeeyyeech...!)
014028009X|3.0|Bridget Jones Diary was written during that phase when Jane Austen was being revived and emulated with regularity. Modern day Bridget is desperate to be a member of the smug marrieds, but she still retains her singleton status. Embarking on a self- improvement plan, she charts her progress with weightloss, reduction in alcohol and cigarette consumption, and success with the opposite sex. At the end of a year, she notes the results that have come to pass. Meanwhile, she meets Mr. Darcy,<br />Gets involved with her boss, witnesses the upheavel of her parents' relationship, and whines about the condition of life for a young thirty-something who has been eluded by romance.<br />At times I enjoyed this little diary approach to life for singles, but it grow tiresome at times. I kept thinking how sad for these young women to be putting their lives on hold when they could be having such a lovely time with life. They were employed, had a safe environment, and friends. Too bad they didn't learn that the best way to meet someone is to do the things that make you happy. Then you'll meet someone with whom you can relate to.
B00005JG6R|5.0|Before i saw this movie i really didnt think much of Japanimation.  I rented it because nothing else was at the video store. It has turned out to be one of the best movies i have ever seen. I had to watch it twice to fully grasp it but it truly is an incredible movie. It is considered the greatest anime ever and is also considered one of the best movies of all time because of its rich storyline and amazing animation(for its time).  It is a powerful and emotional movie with interesting ideas and characters. WATCH THIS MOVIE.  You will be suprised.
B000059PR5|5.0|I don't remember if I saw this movie or not as a young boy; I was only 3 1/2 when it was first shown on TV. I remember seeing it for the first time last summer when I was 20. Even though the threat of nuclear war with the Russians is sharply diminished, I truly understood the meaning and purpose of the movie.<br />I was a baby in the early 80's when US/Soviet tensions heated up. I never truly understood the danger of the period. However, in watching the movie, I realize just how likely nuclear war is even today. Watching the posturing and preening and machinations of countries like China, India, Pakistan and Israel, it makes me wonder if we might not see a nuclear war in our lifetimes.<br />The movie itself is a fine piece of work, you can't go wrong with Jason Robards and JoBeth Williams and John Cullum. It's a great script and it is wonderfully acted. It must be a tough role playing a nuclear war survivor having to deal with total social chaos. But they picked good actors for this movie, and a totally superb film resulted.<br />The world has changed rapidly and dramatically since 1983. But the story and the theme of The Day After has not worn out; if anything it's stronger. There are still thousands of nuclear warheads out there, still more than enough to easily destroy the human race. We must never use them, because as Jason Robards mentions in the movie &quot;[cockroaches will be] the only guranteed survivor of a nuclear war.&quot; Strongly recommended viewing for everyone.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is really good if you like really good CD's. But I mostly like for its lyrics and musical greatness.
B00003CX8I|5.0|In the near future, a new breed of humans--known as mutants--begins to emerge from the general population. Gifted (or cursed, depending on one's standpoint) with a variety of extranormal abilities, these mutants face fear and distrust from society. But under the leadership of Professor Charles Xavier, a group of these mutants has banded together to help light the path to a better future for both mutants and normal humans. This is the premise of &quot;X-Men.&quot;<br />Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter David Hayter faced a daunting task in taking the massive X-Men mythos (which has evolved through decades of different comic book titles, and has involved an encyclopedic number of characters) and adapting it into a feature film. But, together with a superb international cast, the filmmakers succeed brilliantly.<br />A prologue set during the Nazi Holocaust sets the overall serious tone for the film--a welcome change from the increasingly campy and ridiculous &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise. Yes, &quot;X-Men&quot; is a science fiction film with plentiful action and special effects. But at its heart, this film is an intelligent drama about characters who face crises and challenges.<br />Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) squares off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a rival mutant leader with a radically different philosophy. Add to this struggle Bruce Davison as a McCarthyesque, mutant-hating U.S. senator, and you have a rich tapestry of ideological conflict which serves as a backdrop for the frequently explosive action. But overall I found the emotional core of the film to lie in the relationship between Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a seemingly indestructible warrior with retractable metal claws, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young mutant with the ability to suck the life force out of others. Each of the actors delivers an excellent performance.<br />The mutants of &quot;X-Men&quot; can be seen as metaphors for any feared or persecuted group in human history. Ultimately, the film celebrates the ability of oppressed individuals to overcome alienation, to form supportive communities, and to work for a greater good. It is, I believe, the film's success in tapping into universal human fears, hopes, and ideological conflicts that elevates it above being merely an excellent sci-fi action epic.Ultimately, the film celebrates the ability of oppressed individuals to overcome alienation, to form supportive communities, and to work for a greater good.

B000056MOD|5.0|I ve seen all the highlander movies but not the TV series.And most reviews say that if you liked the 1st highlander you hate endgame, but i didnt.I thought it was very well done but i didnt like lamberts acent its a bit annoying but a great preformance by adrian paul without him the movie would be crap.I say that this movie should of had come to the cimemas here in ireland but it didnt it came out on video on the 21 of may which is dissappointing because ive been waiting since september 2000.Im dissapointed with this  country.Well great movie not much swordfights but the swordfights a very impressive and lambert is mostly in the flashback barely in the present day but im puzzeled why did they but the title ENDGAME on it.
0064407667|1.0|It amazes me, and I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY anyone could describe this book as a&quot; delightful, funny, linguistically playful book&quot;.  I am always on the lookout for books for my 7 year old grandson who is a gifted reader. Had I handed him this book without reading it first, I would have been horrified to find out the story line. It was an over-all depressing book.  Even I had nightmares! Perhaps it would make a good reading / writing assignment at the high school level, but even then, I would hesitate to actually recommend it. If I could say something nice about this book, I would.  However, I can't.  It's back to Harry Potter, The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe, and Dealing With Dragons!
B00005J6SZ|5.0|MADONNA's LIKE A VIRGIN sounds Better than Ever! I just bought the remastered Album version of LIKE A VIRGIN  today and it brings back those good old 80's Days. This CD never sounded better and along with the Digital Remaster you get 2 Bonus Tracks such as Like A Virgin (Extended  Dance Remix) an Material Girl (Extended Dance Remix). Buy this Amazing sounding CD and be touched again for the very first time!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this album over a year ago and I must say that it is the most original album I've ever heard. From the opening guitar line of &quot;Airbag&quot; to the bell ding at the end of &quot;The Tourist&quot;, this album blew me away. You will need to listen to this album repeatedly to appreciate it ... because with each repeat you hear something different than you did before that causes you to appreciate it even more. Wow! What an increadible effort by Radiohead. The production is first quality and I would venture to say that it is the album of the 90s. My only regret is that I didn't buy this until almost 3 years after it came out (I could have started to enjoy it earlier).<br />Warning: this is not a pop record. These guy are serious musicians and very talented. Thom Yorke is a wonderful songwriter. There is really not one bad song on this album. All are great and stick out on their own. If you like music that is very diverse (the song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is as diverse as you will every get in one song alone and quite beautiful), then I recommend you buy OK Computer. I've never hear anything like it ... it's a very significant record and should be on everyone's top 10 list.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I just bought the remastered version of MADONNA's first self titled album called MADONNA today which has such classics as EVERYBODY, LUCKY STAR, and BORDERLINE.

B00003CX8I|4.0|As a fan of the TV show &quot;X-Men&quot; and a reader of the comic books, I am sorry to say that there were some major mistakes made by the writers of this movie with the making of this film.  While I do admire the effort, making Storm a history teacher, Beast was conspicuously absent from this film.  He would have made an excellent English teacher or a professor of languages.  He was already a medical doctor by trade.  I wouldn't have put Rogue and Jubilee in the same class because the orignal members were all in their mid-twenties or older when Jubilee joined them both in the comic books and on the TV show. Rogue already had the ability to fly, thanks to Marvel Girl.  At 14, Rogue was taken in by Mystique, &quot;Mama&quot; and coerced into sucking the life from Marvel Girl, leaving her in a coma and listed as a Jane Doe in the cartoon. At least Bobby's (Iceman) role was correct.  He liked to push limits with athority AND he was two years older than Jubilee.  Patrick Stewart played an excellent Professor X.  Maybe some of the gaps left in this movie will be filled if Hollywood decides on a sequel.
B00005J6T0|5.0|I just bought the remastered version of MADONNA's third Album &quot;TRUE BLUE&quot; today which has such classics as OPEN YOUR HEART, PAPA DON'T PREACH, LIVE TO TELL, DRESS YOU UP and so much more.

Buy this Amazing sounding CD and Open Your Heart to MADONNA.
B00005AR3G|3.0|I have to wonder; were the other reviewers watching the same movie I was?  Don't get me wrong, I love Disney animated movies.  Most of them are full of fun and mischeif and tell a compelling story.  A very few fall way short of the mark.  I beleive this is one of those few.  There are several aspects of this film that seem to be missing something and it's hard to define what that something is.  The animation is good, but not up to previous standarts.  In fact is seems to be just in between a usual Disney feature and one of their &quot;direct to video&quot; efforts.  The story is very basic and tends to go nowhere. Only one character shows any kind of development and it's almost like you miss the transition from selfish to caring. The songs...well, besides the &quot;theme song guy&quot;, there were none.  I mean, let's face it, most of us expect a musical when it comes to Disney animated fare.  The humor was good at times, but not nearly as funny as the other reviewers indicated.  People tend to see the fast paced humor as relative to Aladin, but I beg to differ.  The humor was very different.  In Aladin, the Genie was not confined to the &quot;time&quot; of the story.  He had been all over time and space with his powers and thus the modern references worked.  Anything out of place with that doesn't.  Aztecs with lab coats and rubber gloves?  Just doesn't quite work.
6304493681|5.0|It's very unique, no anime movies I have seen can compare to it. If you are looking for an all around action cartoon like Ninja Scroll or Akira, then you might not like this. This cartoon is a piece of art when it comes down to animation and it also has a great story. I don't think the story is too complicated to understand, but you might have to concentrate more than usual. I wish I could tell you what kind of movie you could compare it to but unfortunatly I can't, it's unique. I would highly recommend this movie...
B000002TPS|5.0|This album is one of my favorite all time albums!! It Rocks, Songs like Reconing Day, Addicted to Chaos, A Tout Le Monde and Blood of Heroes just rock!! I highly recomend this one!
6305014140|5.0|This is the best Sword &amp; Sorcery anime ever made (and, imho, the best anime period). This movie is what got me turned onto the anime genre. It has everything a great anime should have, good characters, great animation, incredible action, and a good story. Highly reccomended.
B00000K0DT|3.0|There's a cardinal unspoken agreement between a filmmaker and his audience.  The audience agrees to submit to his small world and let him drive for a couple of hours, and he in turn agrees not to abuse their trust in suspending their disbelief.  The Usual Suspects gleefully violates that agreement, and that is ultimately the weakest aspect of this film.  You may have heard this already, but the ending really does negate the entire film thanks to the storytelling device chosen.<br />Otherwise, it's a very well-crafted, well-acted, entertaining film.  Spacey in particular is continually being given kudos, but his performance has become somewhat overrated...Gabriel Byrne and Stephen Baldwin are easily as good if not better.<br />If you mind watching a whole film only to have a plot &quot;twist&quot; at the end that basically says &quot;oops...just kidding about all that&quot; (and lord knows I wouldn't blame you), you won't like this film.  If you're willing to overlook that fact, and just enjoy the journey for its own sake (even knowing that the destination makes the trip moot), then you'll enjoy it.<br />Oh, and pretending that you need &quot;higher intelligence&quot; to &quot;get&quot; this film is laughable.  How could anyone not get it...it bludgeons the audience with a plot sledgehammer.  And conversely, it doesn't take a genius to see the gaping black hole in the story by the movie's end either.<br />Technically, the DVD is a bit disappointing.  The image quality is not the greatest, the sound is poor (Dolby 2.0 only, not 5.1), and the only subtitles are spanish.  Ironically, the trailer included in the &quot;extras&quot; is in Dolby 5.1 though.  And one plus is that the filmmaker's commentary track is one of the better ones around.<br />An entertaining film, if you're willing to ignore that it makes itself almost meaningless by the end.
B00001ODHF|5.0|God, who hasn't seen this movie? Well, if you haven't, you should. So many memorable one liners, this movie will add greatly to your vocabulary. :D Ash is one of the best heroes ever, and he shines in this movie (I personally didn't like him in the other 2 [Army of Darkness is the third in the evil dead series, and the other two are also reccomended]).
0792151712|5.0|James Cameron (of &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; fame) has directed and written a superbly crafted story that surely wins over critics and general audiences, not because it had promising Leonardo DiCaprio (of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Growing Pains&quot; fame) as a handsome peniless artist, but it bravely and flawlessly blends a fictional love story with a real-life disaster.<br />Treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) comes across a rusted safe while exploring the remains of the Titanic. He brings it up, cracks it open, and finds nothing but a perfectly preserved nude portrait of a young lady, drawn the day the Titanic sank. An old woman (Gloria Stuart) recognizes the portrait as her 86 years younger, at the age of 26. She and her grown granddaughter visit Lovett and his friends, and the old woman, known as Rose, recapulates the whole story about her brief love affair on the Titanic with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) 86 years ago (Kate Winslet as the younger Rose), to the aftermath when she, along with six others (without Jack), were rescued from the icy water.<br />&quot;Titanic&quot; is a sweeping, gripping romance/drama that takes place against a cataclysmic event, with timeless grace and universal emotions, about love, infidelity, and the true meaning of &quot;treasure.&quot; It's one of those rare movies that'll make anyone cry at the end like a girl (I did, despite I'm a boy). Along with a fitting soundtrack, it's a precious and affecting movie to hold on to (considering that it won about 11 Academy Awards).<br />Rated PG-13 for language, some tasteful nudity by Kate Winslet, and for disaster-related violence.
B000000OAA|5.0|Forget all of the hype surrounding &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; for a minute.  Sure, it was amusing the first 10,000 times you heard it, but let's face facts:  Queen never rocked as hard as they did on &quot;Sheer Heart Attack,&quot; except for maybe &quot;Tie Your Mother Down.&quot;  &quot;Brighton Rock,&quot; &quot;Now I'm Here,&quot; and &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; cut right to the quick, with guitar-hero-in-training Brian May picking and power chording his way into your heart with a multi-layered (and probably infinitely overdubbed) attack on his homemade guitar.  Alas, this was the end of an era for the band as they, beginning with their next album &quot;A Night At The Opera,&quot; surrendered to the theatrical leanings and pomp rock tendencies of vocalist Freddie Mercury.
014028009X|5.0|After seeing the movie and loving it, I decided to read the book.  The book was better than the movie and I couldn't put it down.  Helen Fielding does a great job of making every woman feel like she is Bridget.  I found myself laughing out loud at night in bed and waking my husband up.  This book is truly a guilty pleasure, and if you want something light to read this is it.  It's funny, poignant, and very hip!
B000007WNN|5.0|Up until the release of this album, The Cult had built a career around appealing to the goth crowd, which is what makes &quot;Electric&quot; such a revelation.  Ian Astbury and (especially) Billy Duffy must have been listening to a lot of Angus and Malcolm Young between the release of &quot;Love&quot; and this album.  &quot;Wild Flower,&quot; &quot;Lil' Devil,&quot; and &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot; all strike with the subtlety of Bon Scott-era AC/DC, as Duffy joyously churns out the power chords like a folkie in a coffee house who has just plugged in for the first time.  Impressive...
B000002UWP|4.0|Don't expect any deep emotional journeys with Roxette's latest album, in true Rox style its as shallow as a puddle, but it remains a guilty pleasure and a gem from start to finish.<br />THANK THE LORD ABOVE that they have dumped the incipid Bananarama meets Madonna that choked up Look Sharp! Joyride leaves their previous effort for dead with synthetically enhanced hard power pop, imagine Bon Jovi meets The Bangles meets Heart. Joyride is catchier than The Beatles and Abba combined with so many absorbing melodies you'll have the whole album stuck in your head after two listens.<br />The title track, which consists of a Funk style melody line but presented as a rock tune, contains the most intensely catchy chorus ever, but lyrically makes as much sense as bad French poetry. Hotblooded is a raunchy glam-metal romp, while I Remember You, The Big L, Church Of Your Heart, and Small Talk is just bursting with luscious power pop catchiness. (Do You Get) Excited, definately the album's highpoint is a sensual and seductive piece that almost Beat's Madonna's 'Justify My Love' at its own game.<br />Lyrically, the album shows potential in Watercolours In The Rain, a song about loneliness in the big city, and Knockin On Every Door, making sarcastic jabs at an ex lover. The big power ballads, Fading Like A Flower, the mesmorizing Things Will Never Be The Same and Spending My Time address the heartache of break up with emotional conviction, the latter showing Roxette's cynical side for the first time ('this silly game of love/you play to win only to lose')<br />Unfortunately the album falls flat on its face occasionally. Why re-release the worst song on their debut album for crying out loud?? (Soul Deep.) Physical Fascination is a bad attempt at sensual funk (leave that to Prince thank you very much) and Perfect Day just sounds like a nursery rhyme.<br />Yeah, buy this album. There's nothing particularly intelligent about it but neither was 'With The Beatles' and people still go goo goo over that album.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|This movie was entertaining when I saw it, and I liked it so that's always a plus.  However, for a movie about stealing cars, there wasn't a whole lot of car stealing scenes nor many car chases.  The whole point of this movie is sport cars, so shouldn't the director plan the movie around, say, sport cars?  There was way too much pointless plot before the all-to-quick car theft.  And they made the ending so sad it's tough to watch (you car fans know what I'm talking about).<br />Overall the movie does entertain, but in my opinion, the focus was not in the right area.
0553573403|5.0|After a steady diet of Jordan, Feist, Eddings and a host of others, A _Game of Thrones_ is an exciting change.  This is my first book by Martin and I was very pleased.  The book contains excellent writing and a griping story.  I could not put the book down.  Every chapter is a treat. What Martin does is change the point of view with each chapter.  He tells you who narrating the story by titling each chapter with the characters name.  The delightful part is each chapter is practically a short story.  I looked forward to each chapter because you knew it will be something new and exciting.<br />The thing I should note is the lack of fantasy.  Truly, the only science fiction/fantasy you get is a few pages near the end of the book.  So if you are looking for a magical story with lots of fairytale endings don't look here.  Instead what you get is a great story with believable characters.  You get a sense that these are real people reacting to harsh situations.  The female characters especially shine.  You believe that they are real people and their actions are realistic.<br />Some of the other reviewers claim that the book is depressing and the setting is dismal.  It is true that some of the major characters die and the quote \\"Winter is Coming\\" is practically the theme.  However, the reader receives the feeling that  tough times call for tough characters.<br />The only caution I can give, is this book is for adults.  There are adult situations and language used throughout the book.<br />I can hardly wait to start the next book.
0380778556|2.0|... Though highly readable, I find the characters to be rather flat, and the plot a tad bit too predictable. It also has a tendency to drift, which gives me the impression that Dame Du Maurier had written this without really knowing where she was heading herself. On top of that, I find this novel to be far from atmospheric or brooding. Rather, the devices employed to create an eerie atmosphere eg Danny's skull-like head etc, seem to me to be rather contrived. Maybe I'm feeling this way because I have heard too much positive feedback prior to my reading, it's easy to be disappointed when the novel falls slightly short of my expectations. But one thing for sure is that this is not the best suspense thrillers I've read. I'll stick with Victoria Holt.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Surely this is one of the most original and exciting films of 2001 ... and this is one of the strangest and most thrilling albums of the summer.<br />Forget about the ghetto-fabulous cover of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;.  It isn't all that.  Buy this album instead for the wonderful tracks that feature Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor singing classic songs from pop history in lushly orchestrated, musical theater arrangements that boldly announce - just as does the film they come from - that the Hollywood musical is not dead.  <br />The strangely titled &quot;Elephantine Love Medley&quot; soars and may even bring a tear or two to your eye, such is the youthful and naively optimistic sentiment found therein.  For some reason, my favorite track is &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;, a tribute to the Bollywood musical ... where else can you hear Ms. Kidman sing (or is it chant?) in Hindi over a swirling Eastern percussion?<br />Moulin Rouge is bold, it's garish, it's Baz Luhrmann through and through. Love him or hate him, his work is undeniably visionary.
B000000H4A|5.0|After the break-up of Mercyful Fate in '85, I was uncertain as to how I was going to enjoy this new band. But from the moment &quot;The Candle&quot; begins, I knew this was going to be something special. King is top form, showcasing his high octave screaming. Denner and Hansen from Fate really help make the backbone of the band, and their familiarity helps, as well. But let's not forget Andy LaRocque and the legendary Mikkey Dee on drums really help give this band a wonderful sound. It's really unlike any other King Diamond release, as it still has a haunting Mercyful Fate feel, but without Shermann's guitars or music writing, just his influence is felt. So, &quot;Fatal Portrait could be considered an &quot;unofficial&quot; third Mercyful Fate album? Anyhoot, the album rocks, touched off with wonderfully creep keyboard accompanyment. A classic melodic/thrash/speed/gothic metal album, and a great start to a new band.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Unlike most critics it seems, I really liked Depeche Mode's previous releases &quot;Ultra&quot; and &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;. Their hyperkinetic melodrama had a theatricality that seemed bold and exciting.  With their latest release, &quot;Exciter&quot;, DM has gone back twelve years and revisits their sounds of &quot;Violator&quot;.   With the exception of the opening track &quot;Dream On&quot;, the vampirish &quot;Dead of Night&quot;, and the electronic rave &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, &quot;Exciter&quot; doesn't excite.  David Kahane's voice merely grates and plaintively groans over synthesized noise that is neither melodic nor particularly inspired.<br />This album, however,is not a total lost cause.  The tracks mentioned above have an urgency that keeps you coming back to hear more ... and while overall the album has a monotonous feel, there is something hypnotic to it all.  I continue to listen even while realizing it isn't very good, yet I cannot seem to pull myself away.<br />I suppose there's something in that.
B000001FTH|4.0|My favorite song on this entire album is &quot;I've seen that face before.&quot;  Musically and lyrically it's a wonderful trip to a dark, mysterious place that I'm sure you have in your own mind.<br />Another notable favorite is &quot;Slave To The Rhythym.&quot;  Overall, wonderful music and lyrically captivating throughout.
B000001DYD|5.0|Most people think its disjointed. I find it inspired.To me her most, cerebral, most intense recording.Killer!
6300216802|2.0|I love Star Trek beyond belief but this first outing is a testament to one's patience as it was just bone-achingly slow.<br />&quot;Damn it, Bones, we need to stop this thing now!!  But before we do that, let's take a shuttle to the Enterprise&quot; (because the transporters are conveniently down) &quot;and show broad, wide, sweeping shots of the Enterprise that eats up so much screen time that it's a wonder that this mysterious cloud hasn't consumed us whole by now!!&quot;<br />In fact, Kirk seems so caught up by the majesty of the Enterprise that it's a wonder that he seems to be in such a hurried rush later.<br />Oh, and don't get me started about the acting in various scenes.<br />My favorite is the Enterprise's reaction to the cloud's effect on the visual screen--it just seems to be a shocked, drunken stupor and you can almost hear the &quot;Wow...that was not good, right?&quot; coming from every face in the room.<br />The wormhole scene...owwww[...]  Tension is simply caused because you are waiting for someone to spout off a line, NOT because you're actually worried about the meteor hitting the ship.<br />The costumes are painful to watch and it's easy to tell who is male or female in THIS chorus line.  Thank heavens for the dramatic costume improvement from Star Trek II onwards.<br />There are some good moments, but if you're looking for something to nap and wake up occasionally for plot, then this is your flick.

YOu have a hitman who gets an invitation to his ten year high school reunion and at the same time has to do a hit there, and then bumps into Minnie Driver and has to explain to her as to why he stood her up.

This Dvd has High Great sound and the picture quality is awesome on my 5.1 Sony SS-TS300 Outstanding Sound! Get this version.P.S John Cusack's role in high fidelity was a mistake.A Long boring movie (Not Good)! If you want a laugh keep your eyes on Jack Black, also in saving silverman.

I remember checking it ou from the library as was simply amazed by this book. after reading the book, i was sadly disappointed by the movie with jack nickolson. Let me make this comment on those whos have seen the movie. If you thought the movie was great than the book is by far better.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Steven Soderbergh doesn't miss once with this thought-provoking, highly entertaining ensemble thriller.
B000000I3O|5.0|The title is no joke. the problem is is where to start,bullet? mommy, can i go out and kill tonight? astro zombies? i could go through the whole track listing. This album for me is the ultimate misfit album, it just sums up what the misfits are about. if you haven't got this yet buy it,i definately recommend it if you haven't heard any of their original stuff yet.In short this is a classic that will imbed those catchy tunes into your head for eternity and boy when their there you'll never want them to leave.
0451196716|5.0|There has already been enough said about the brilliance of this book, (though nothing has been said about the obvious Vietnam metaphor) so I won't belabour the point.  I just want to say, please people, pay attention to what you're reading!  The ending is very clear.  HE DIES!
0684865130|4.0|When Joseph Heller's Catch-22 was published in the United States in 1961, many people believed that the book bashed war and the military. Returning the favor, many critics condemned the book. Some, however, defended Heller, contending that the book was in fact not about war or the military, but was a commentary on American society. Furthermore, Heller dwells on a few specific aspects of American society, like the emergence of mega-corporations.<br />\\"Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy. Frankly I think that the whole society is nuts - and the question is: what does a sane man do in an insane society?\\" -Joseph Heller (AP)<br />As Norman Podhoretz said in his essay, \\"Looking Back At Catch-22,\\" Heller's real subject was the nature of American society at the time he wrote this book. But how? It sure seems as though this is a novel about war. The setting is in Italy during World War II. The characters fly combat missions on a daily basis. They act like soldiers. In fact, they are soldiers. So how can this novel not be about war? It is not about war because of the meaning buried within the narrative - the war serves only as a vehicle for Heller's message. But what is Heller's message? The novel jumps from place to place, almost illogically, perhaps like American society. So how do we figure out his message? By carefully reading the lines of text, and in between the lines, we see that Heller thinks that American society is crazy.   \\"What would they do to me,\\" he asked in confidential tones, \\"if I refused to fly them?\\" \\"We'd probably shoot you,\\" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen replied. \\"We?\\" Yossarian cried in surprise. \\"What do you mean, we? Since when are you on their side?\\" \\"If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?\\" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen retorted.<br />And perhaps this exchange between ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen and Yossarian is a commentary on how people in this country have no sense of loyalty to anything. Reading into his commentary, wesee that Heller has lost hope for society.<br />During the writing of this book, companies merged and \\"acquired\\" each other right and left. From this merger and acquisition frenzy came the term \\"corporate America.\\" Once again, Heller deems this to be crazy, so he makes fun of it. In the book, Milo's syndicate, M&amp;M Industries, represents one such large corporation. He claims that if the syndicate makes a profit then it is good for everyone. This is analogous to corporations that claim that if they merge, they will be able to provide a better product, which is better for the consumer. Well, in reality, it cuts jobs and thus creates larger profits for the corporation. Nonetheless, corporations present some damn good arguments for merging, just as Milo presents some damn good arguments for why the syndicate is good for everyone - \\"everyone gets a share\\" (Heller). Furthermore, M&amp;M Industries exhibits some organized crime structure as well. Perhaps Heller is saying that the size and political power of these mega-corporations (which were nothing like the corporations today vis-à-vis BP-Amoco, Microsoft, AOL/Netscape-Time Warner, etc.) makes them too powerful, and that they can do anything that they please, legal, quasi-legal, or blatantly illegal, much like organized crime. To put it bluntly: it's not about war, stupid. What it is about is American society and how it is spiraling downward towards oblivion. Furthermore, Heller thinks he is the only sane one in an insane world - like Yossarian. Heller thinks that everyone is crazy, and so he broadcasts his message to everyone via his book - if they are sane enough to decode his message - a catch-22 in and of itself. <br />\\"It used to shock me and alarm me and discourage me that there was a general decline of everything of value. But it doesn't surprise me anymore. It seems inevitable and natural and there's no way to resist it.\\" -Joseph Heller (AP)
B00004XOWM|3.0|What the Rolling Stones did in the 60s with their louder guitars, stuck-up attitude, and pissed-off lyrics, Limp Bizkit has done again in the new millenium. <br /> Fred Durst is Mick Jagger, flinging words in the air like he just don't care, a brawler with a microphone.  Sometimes it's hard to notice just how much time and thinking really pours into the efforts he makes in songs like &quot;My Way&quot;.   <br /> &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; is the first Limp Bizkit song that I would listen to without changing the station.  Why?  Durst managed to bring together a tight instrumental force with a growling, fierce voice and meaningful lyrics.  Yes, Durst did this.  &quot;I know why you wanna hate me, cause hate is all the world has seen lately.&quot; <br /> The boys of Limp aren't all social-edged rebel rousing fighters, as seen in that line above.  With songs like Rollin', the boys fall back into their tame party-house rock-rap, echoing the shallowness of &quot;Nookie&quot;.   <br /> All in all, this album is a start, a new direction and it's a good thing.  From a band I thought I'd cringe whenever I heard, I can now listen to, mainly due to a much more experienced and pained Durst.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Lady Marmalade by Mya, Pink, Lil' Kim, and Christina is the best song on this album.  I can't wait for this movie to come out!
B00005AFVR|4.0|The songs on the CD as noted in the liner notes are for the most part not the twisted dark tales that made Springsteen a legend, but thundering roadhouse rock tunes.  Approaching the age of 50, Springsteen's latest tour was a celebration of something missing from modern music, no-guilt, no searching for nirvana in grundge music, just straight-ahead bruising rock 'n roll.   <br /> Springsteen chronicles the tour beautifully in this concert, the pure majesty of the event was nostagically caught.  Some might question the banalness of songs like My Love Will Not Let You Down and Ramrod, but every now and then he throws in songs that show he is still a people's poet.  There's Badlands, Lost in the Flood, Atlantic City, and Youngstown to balance the fray of mindless rock.   More importantly, from the soul of Springsteen pours two new, relevent and beautiful songs, Land of Hopes and Dreams and American Skin (41 Shots).  While American Skin caught heat for its lyrics that implicate that New York City police are a little gun-happy, Land of Hopes and Dreams is Springsteen reaching for a perfect, harrowing love song.  Land of Hopes and Dreams moves along like a smoothly-flowing river, never darting from its course, with beautiful lyrics and the E Street band reaching for its full reentry into the world after years apart. <br /> Maybe too nostalgic, maybe too long, maybe too many simple rock songs, but overall, it's another album that is a testament to the finest songwriter of the past 25 years' capabilities and the return of one of the most underrated and best bands ever.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a movie that truly EVERYONE can gain something from.  It is the first movie that I have ever watched straight through, then rewinded, and started over again.  It totally threw me for a loop.  I had no trouble following it, but many people may be put off at its &quot;slow&quot; begginning.  The impact hit me like a ton of bricks.  This is the most mind-blowing thing I have ever seen put on film.  I knew, after renting it, I would have to own the DVD.  (consumerism, I know) but trust me, it's certainly worth it.<br />Fight Club is given the full treatment.  Both, the sound and the picture is dead-on.  There are MORE than enough features here to satisfy any Dvd junky.  This is definitely one to own.
B000002A33|5.0|Screaming Trees &quot;Dust&quot; is one of the most underrated albums of the 90's,or not so much underrrated as &quot;Lost&quot;.Screaming Trees were lost in the early 90's so called &quot;Grunge bands&quot; revolution,and that's really too bad.They should've been huge,and this is the album that should've done for them.Songs 1-10 are great,oh wait,that's the hole album.<br />While this band is now gone,they'll never be forgotten.
0452282152|5.0|If I hadn't been involved in a reading group I never would have known about and would have missed reading one of the best books I've ever read. The author creates the story behind one of Vermeer's most celebrated paintings, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;. Griet is that girl. She is from a simple upbringing and due to her father's accident on the job he is unable to work.  She must work to earn money to help the family and is sent to work for an upper class family as a servant. The family is that of the famous painter, Johannes Vermeer. She has a sense of color and organization that captures the painter's interest from the moment he meets her. With Griet in their home there is lots of tension, which is ruled over by the Vermeer's jealous, clumsy, eternally pregnant wife and his mother-in-law. Griet is quiet but strong. As the story continues Griet finds that she is falling in love with Vermeer.  I also believe that Vermeer respects and loves Griet as much as a self-absorbed person can love. But this love can never be fulfilled.  For not standing up for Griet I feel that Vermeer tried to apologize in the end.  The author captures life in 1660s Delft, Holland beautifully. The book was a pleasure to read from beginning to end.
0316236535|5.0|I'm a second grade teacher for English Language Learners.  The newcomers to the country loved this book as well as children who have already been here a couple years.  The book is easy for them to understand and uses predictable language and basic vocabulary (sight words, body part, and colors)as well as fun words like &quot;squiggly&quot;.  After hearing it just once they were excitedly reading along with me and later asked to read it on their own.  The cut out pictures make the book fun and as the body parts disappear they read along. They loved the ending &quot;and don't come back until I tell you to!&quot;.  I am ordering this book today and I highly recommend it for any parent or educator of children ages 2-7.
B000002J23|4.0|When Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left Yes after the band's noticeably better than average 1978 album &quot;Tormato&quot; was released, it would appear to be kaputz, as far as this legendary progressive rock group's musical craftsmanship and output was concerned. Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (both formerly of the new wave group &quot;The Buggles&quot;, who had a hit with &quot;Video Killed The Radio Star&quot;, released in 1979. It was also the very first video MTV aired in 1981.) both prove to be able replacements for both Anderson and Wakeman, although Horn's vocals don't have quite the zip and charisma that Anderson displayed. As far as Downes' keyboard style is concerned, when compared with Wakeman's style, Downes seems to rely less on technique and more on rapid-fire playing. This kind of musicianship seems out of place on a Yes recording, but nevertheless, it works on &quot;Drama&quot;. The CD begins with a roaring guitar fade in, courtesy of Steve Howe on &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;, and continues with foot-stomping vigor throughout the track. Things come to a standstill on the brief and regressive &quot;White Car&quot;. Then the progressive embracings return to life on &quot;Does It Really Happen?&quot; The most interesting piece, as well as the best track musically here, a mechanical, musical machine known as &quot;Into The Lens&quot;, possibly earns Yes gold star status, complete with a mixture of Steve Howe's remarkable guitar and Chris Squire's over-the-top bass playing. &quot;Run Through The Light&quot;, seems to be a little nonchalant and very overplayed. &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; closes out &quot;Drama&quot; on a strong note, complete with an answer to Yes! The lyric quality here may not be as strong, as is the case of Yes' other albums, but perhaps the strongest track in the Lyrics, Incorporated Dept as far as &quot;Drama&quot; is concerned, would have to go to &quot;Into The Lens&quot;, with its overly cliched line &quot;I Am A Camera&quot;. But, what makes &quot;Drama&quot; all the more unique, is due to the fact this was Jon Anderson's only album on which he did not appear - unique in a way that Jon's contributions to the band have always been surprisingly stellar to most Yes fans (including myself). Therefore, he has brought many a good idea to the creative Yes table throughout his long and glamorous career, so its hard to imagine any Yes lineup without him. To many Yes fans, his presence was sorely missed on an album of this style, but not for long, as Yes continued to grow and change in the years ahead, with Jon Anderson back in the fold, including another original member, Tony Kaye. Together, these two revamped Yes with a totally new look, as well as a new sound in the early '80's, although their new sound wouldn't quite match their magnificent early '70's albums. Even die-hard fans of this legendary group, as well as those who are new to Yes' music, will find that &quot;Drama&quot; will grow on them after a few listens. So, even if the music still doesn't appease you after a few listens, then please buy it for Yes artist Roger Dean's illustrious cover art, which is absolutely breathtaking, and is worth the price of &quot;Drama&quot; alone.

B00005B36H|3.0|I had written a pretty harsh review of this album about a week ago, and I just wanted to change a few things and restate some others.  First, I still think Aenema is a better album . . and I don't think they were taking it in a different direction, as far as the album title, or the song titles, they're just the same old TOOL, I don't think they're in any 'different' direction what so ever.  The album still sounds like what didn't work for Aenema, and by saying that I mean it just sounds TOO MUCH like Aenema, but not as good.  I still say it's a dissapointment and that they can do ...  a lot better.  Come on, we've waited like 5 years and this is the best they can come up with?  I'd save my money for the next A Perfect Circle record, atleast we can guarantee it will sound original and new.

0385501560|5.0|Palahniuk outdoes himself with this fourth installment of his usual style.I wish I could write this well. I read Choke in one night and was blown away. His plot emerges from underneath a barrage of dead-on imagery and belly-laugh satire. Some of the lines in this book I found TOO profound to underline. I enjoyed this novel even more than his last outing: Survivor. I'm not going to give away the plot, but this is definitely not for the sqeamish. Sex addicts, alzheimers, and the Heimlich all fall prey to Chuck's vicious wit. If you've read any of his other work and enjoyed in the least, you owe it to yourself to investigate Mr. Palahniuk's adaptation of today's real world.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I may be biased, but this is a great collection of Christmas music.  I've been a long-time fan of the Carpenters, so I enjoy most of the music that they recorded.  Actually, I'm mostly a Karen Carpenter fan, not so much a Carpenters fan.  But it's difficult to separate the two since Karen, except for the failed solo album, only recorded with her brother Richard, as the Carpenters.<br />While Richard is very talented, in my opinion Karen's voice was the driving force that sold the Carpenters.  I must admit though that Richard knew how to pick the right songs for Karen to sing; those that tapped into her rich vocal range...the vulnerable, longing part.<br />But enough of that.<br />This collection of Christmas music is just about the best out there.  I have friends who are not Carpenters fans and they love this CD.  The combimation of Karen's voice and Richard's musicianship makes this a great offering.  After listening to this collection I came away with much admiration for Richard's talents.<br />Karen's great moments:  Ave Maria, Little Altar Boy, Christ is Born, Home for the Holidays, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Silent Night, He Came Here for Me.<br />Richard's great moments: great arrangement of Santa Claus is Coming to Town; the Nutcracker Suite, Oh Holy Night, and the rest of the instrumentals.<br />This collection has the right mix of secular and Christian music.<br />Karen Carpenter was meant to sing Christmas music.<br />You don't have to be a Carpenters fan to like this great collection.  So even if you're a self-appointed hipster who wouldn't otherwise buy Carpenters music, you should get this collection; you won't be sorry.  It'll warm your heart at Christmas.<br />Every year, sometime in late December, before the company arrives, I turn off the lights, light the candles, close my eyes, and enjoy this great collection of Christmas music.
B00005B6C9|5.0|This album helps to prove once again that the BeeGees are outstanding singer-songwriters. From the beautiful harmonies in Sacred Trust, and Wedding Day, to the 'hip' She keeps on coming back for more, this cd has something for everyone. My favorite track among all these great songs is Embrace.  I feel this album is much better that Still Waters.  I rank it among their best of all time.
B00005J73X|3.0|I'm pretty much the biggest Bon Jovi fan in the world, and I was so pumped about their latest release!  But when I slid the cd into the player I could tell by the first track, It's My Life, that something wasn't right.  I felt like I was sitting there listening to some bad boot-leg recording.  I understand it's live, but when did that mean the recording had to suck?  Also, some of the song selections on the album have me scratching my head.  &quot;I Don't Like Mondays&quot;?  With all the great songs that didn't make the cut . . . &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Lay You Hands on Me&quot;, &quot;I'll Be There For You&quot;, etc . . . why did two cover songs make the set?  True Bon Jovi fans will buy the album anyway, but I think you'll come to the same conclusion.
055321263X|5.0|I had never heard of the author before but I'm so glad I bought this book. It literally kept me glued to it for the last 6 days. I couldn't sleep and annoyed my husband by keeping the light on all night. It's just that kind of a novel. It's hard to believe it was written more than 100 years ago and that it's not that famous. It's brilliantly written and the characters are so realistic. The story is so suspenseful, you won't be able to stop turning the pages. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read!  The suspense reminded me of the excitement I used to feel when reading Nancy Drew novels when I was younger. Marion is a real heroine!
0064409422|5.0|I have been enjoying this book since my youth (am now in my 30's) and always recommend it as a &quot;must-read&quot; for both children and adults. I purchased this particular version a gift for a friend and was very impressed with the quality of the book. The color illustrations added a lot, and as always, the story has a timeless impact on all who read it. C.S. Lewis is a hero in the world of literature.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is the most visually stunning movie yet from the Coen Bros.<br />The whole idea of doing Homer's Odessy as escaped cons in the depression era south could only come from twisted minds. To have made such a gorgeous treat in the doing is mind boggling.<br />I never thought much of George Clooney until this role, it's not just his best work, it's positively inspired. Dapper Dan indeed.<br />Only the Coen Bros could have produced such a topsy-turvy view of the classics - this movie achieves everything that The Great  Lebowski didn't!
B00000IPAX|1.0|FUFF! Watered-down punk rock with uninspired lyrics, nevermind these amatures. Being a big rock fan I decided to give these guys a try, man, all the songs on this album are so corny &amp; pointless it's a wonder they get the kind of feed-back and ratings they do! It seems to me that all these &quot;try-to-hard-to-be-serious-musican-bands&quot; or whatever is what has caused rock and punk to go so downhill in the last few years. ANd belive me I really wanted to like this band, I really did, but I just couldn't, I have no respect for Blink 182 nor their music. I mean if you like 80's party music (which I hate but I find others do enjoy) I guess you could take a chance, but other then that if you want a REAL album you should better pass on this.
0486227073|5.0|I am a commercial artist and an illustrator in training, after coming across a lot of artistic anatomy books over the years I say honestly that this and all the George Bridgman books are the best available.  A couple of reasons for this are 1) his clear and totally accurate drawings and 2) he shows us muscle groups that act together rather than just naming every single muscle and leaving it at that.  Also, he uses a very visual teaching method, showing the shapes of the muscle masses that are easy to remember. I would suggest that every beginner start with Mr. Bridgman.
B00003CXN4|4.0|With its frank depiction of drug use and its gritty down to earth feel, I enjoyed Traffic and expect to see director Steven        Soderbergh walk away with an Oscar come Academy Award time.<br />       There were 5 or 6 different story lines, a few of which came together at different points. One involved Michael Douglas        as Robert Wakefield, an Ohio State Supreme Court Justice turned United States Drug Czar having to deal with not only        the national and international drug problem, but with the fact that his 16 year old daughter was a drug addict. Another        story line involved Benecio Del Toro as Tijuana police officer Javier Rodriguez caught between the corrupt Mexican        police system, and his moral obligation to make Mexico drug free for future generations. Another story line had Catherine        Zeta-Jones as Helena, an unsuspecting wife of a suspected drug dealer named Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), having to        cope with her husband being carted off to jail, and having her child threatened unless she pays off her husband's debts.        Mixed into that story line were undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman)        who are trying to protect the chief witness again Carlos, while trying to get information against Helena.<br />       What I really loved about Traffic was the documentary-style feel it had. Every location was shot differently, from the        blown out yellow grittyness of Mexico, to the rich upper class color of Cincinnati. Along with the graphic depictions of        drug use and the corruption of the Mexican military and police, it all had the feel of a real life drama, and not just a movie.        All the acting performances were wonderful. Usually a great director can bring out great performances from his/her cast.        It's no surprise that Julia Roberts from the Soderbergh-directed Erin Brockovich is a front runner in the Best Actress        Oscar race, and Benecio Del Toro is a front runner in the Supporting Actor race. Standouts from this movie in my view        include Zeta-Jones as a woman who is slowly transformed into the complete opposite of what she was by circumstances        beyond her control. Don Cheadle, who is one of the best hidden talents in Hollywood, and is just one big role away from        breaking through to mainstream. And the girl I thought had the toughest role in the movie, Erika Christensen as Caroline,        the 16 year old drug addicted daughter of the new drug Czar. I think her performance deserves more recognition than it's        gotten.<br />       The feel of the movie is really what makes this film a cut above others. It doesn't pull any punches in its portrayal of what        life is like for some people. We get to see the inner workings of a corrupt Mexican military, abusing its police power to        steal the lucrative drug trade for itself. We see how even if a police officer is on the moral straight and narrow, he has to        bend to the facts of life to survive on the streets. Back in America we see that even the drug Czar of the United States can        have problems in his own life that are bigger than the country. And we see how a woman will go anywhere and do        anything to protect her children and her family. Director Soderbergh has taken us inside the lives of these people without        glossing it up Hollywood style.<br />       Traffic is a hard hitting film that may be too much for some people. The scenes of drug use are hard to deal with at times.        Seeing what a 16 year old girl will do just to get a fix is troubling. The only part of the film I guess I didn't believe(?) was        watching the drug Czar comb the streets looking for his daughter, instead of calling out the National Guard or something        to track her down. I understand he had his reasons, wanting to keep the whole situation quiet and away from the press,        but it still seemed odd that a person in his position would be willing to wander the streets looking for her. The other        problem I had was that some of the story lines and people got confusing to me, and made parts of the movie hard to        follow. Luckily most of it all came together near the end.<br />       Overall I enjoyed Traffic and I would recommend it to people looking to get out of the Hollywood-style movie scene        we're all used to seeing.
B00005BL2A|1.0|Save your money. Depeche Mode is just going through the motions here. There's nothing really innovative here, nothing &quot;experimental&quot; about any of the lyrics, despite the editor's review listed above. As a matter of fact, the tiresome AA/BB rhyme scheme will probably drive you slowly insane. You know: &quot;I had a CAR, I went to a BAR, I had a nice DRINK, washed my hands in the SINK&quot; so on and so forth. The music is nothing special either: there's a track that is so close to Iggy Pop's &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;, you'll think that you mixed up the discs in your changer. Now, I'm a big fan of these guys, but why keep anyone in Sacred Cow status? When music is bad, it's bad, regardless of who did it. Don't let your devotion to what these guys were (as recently as a couple of years ago) deafen you to what they have become. Save your money, or buy this one REALLY CHEAP on auction.

Amazing insight into myself and my husband, and how we'd been totally off-base with how we were expressing our love to each other! We were told to get two copies, highlight the passages that rang true for ourselves, then swap books. I am going to buy copies for my family members, friends, and almost everyone I know.
0385501560|5.0|I've read all of Chuck's books and this one by far exceeds the boundaries of creativity and satire I thought were possible given the laws of thermodynamics, the speed of light, and what unique understanding I posess of the human psyche and the usefulness of chocolate pudding. On that note, CHOKE tells the agonizing story of Victor Mancini, a man who has spent his whole life trying to measure up to the unrealistic expectations of a demented Italian mother whom he now supports in a rest home through a clever pyramid scheme. This has forced him to drop out of medical school and put his life on hold. He lives a meager existance working in the equivalent of colonial Williamsburg (a backward world that is more real than his own), where he works with Denny, his bald, pathetic best friend and codependent sex addict. Victor uses sex and women in order to avoid the pain of seeing the truth about himself, that is he has become more pathetic than Denny, who has got to be at the sub-zero level of self-esteem. Chuck brings up his unconventional humor on relationships, hitting rock bottom, the twelve step program for addiction, and the political correctness of masking our words in order to protect the public from any stress or panic. There may come a time when it's necessary to yell fire in a theatre but we are far from it. If this doesn't make any sense, then that's a good thing, because it's hard to get a handle on it.  The joy in  reading this book, outside of the fact that my jaw hurts from laughing so hard, is that Chuck makes you wrestle with his characters and Victor is no exception. He puts alzheimer's patients at ease by ingesting the blame for every way they have been wronged, much like christ absolving one from his sins. VIctor in many ways paints the truth to other people as they would like to believe it truely exists, filling them with a false sense of satisfaction that thay are more than happy to reciprocate upon. That is, he fakes choking at restaurants, allowing people to step up to the plate in a safe environment with no danger of failing themselves. Victor makes people the hero they desperately are seeking to be in their own lives.What Victor fails to realize is you can only take this so far before you become the victim of your own deceit. Chuck's books are lathered with the painful aspects of seeing things for what they are, not how we chose to see them. The messages are profound and his insight into obscessive-compulsive behavior should be a must read in every abnormal psychology class....

B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's second album is wonderful. All the songs are really good and it's no surprise that it has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide. Some of the stand out songs in this album are Lucky, where you can really hear Britney sing it passionately. It's probably what Britney is going through today. There is also Don't Let Me Be The Last TO Know where you can hear her vocal talents. There are many more and Britney also co-wrote a song which is &quot;Dear Diary.&quot; I truly reccommend that you buy this album.<br />Another thing that I've noticed is the negative comments towards britney which makes me feel sad for her. I am a huge fan and most of the things said about her aren't true. You can really hear Britney's vocal talents on both of her albums and if you've been to one of her tours, you KNOW that she has talent. People expect her to dress up from head to toe and if she wears a bikini in a video (DLMBTK video) she gets a whole load of insults. It's really saddening that Britney, who is only 19, is having people insult her without even knowing her. She is a true performer and you can see how different she is on stage and off stage. She gives her all and I'll support her in whatever she does.

B00003CXQY|5.0|I was a bit optimistic about seeing this movie, I'm not a big cartoon fan, nor anything else that is animated, but this movie was full of laughs. It was originally intended for my nephew to watch, but I enjoyed it as well! The movie is hilarious, David Spade is perfect for the voice of Kuzco, and the soundtrack is excellent. A great movie for toddlers and grandparents alike!
B0000508U6|4.0|There are many very good reviews about this album... and I'd have to agree with many of them. After seeing the video for 'Yellow' I immediately wanted to get the song, but figured that the entire album would be a disappointment. I certainly was wrong! Parachutes is full of energy; it is oddly uplifting despite the subject matter of most songs! Shiver, while probably the best song on the album... sounds eerily similar to Radiohead! (anyone else think that?) It's not so much the vocals... but the mood and the sound of the band is very radiohead-esqe. After a few listens to the album... my immediate thought was &quot;this is a cross between radiohead's first two albums&quot;. But forget radiohead. This is a VERY good album, not just one or two hits surrounded by filler. If you like the Verve, radiohead, etc... you won't be disappointed.

B00005AQF7|4.0|This is one of a batch of May 2001 released Death-Row remasters of popular Death Row produced albums. This cd also includes a cd-video not available on the original.  If you already own Doggystle, this cd-extra isn't worth the extra money.  The \\"improved\\" sound isn't something you can hear unless you own a [very expensive] stereo system.  Instead, you should check out the import version, also available on Amazon, which some reviewers claim has some extra tracks not on this remastered version or the original.
6304458355|3.0|When I first heard Jumanji was in production I was estatic.  I went out and bought a new copy of the book -- a book I remembered from childhood.  The book had a kind of mystical quality to it from a combination of the incredible illustrations and story.  The movie retains little of this.  The only mystical quality comes from the discovery of the game itself.  The movie pays little attention to the origin of the game.  Instead, the characters inadvertantly jump right into the game.  This part of the movie, the part with all the visuals, is entertaining to watch but requires you to keep your mind at bay.  The story is full of holes, mostly the fact that instead of rushing through the game, they stop and wait to see what happens after each turn (Why?).  However, the CGI animation is excellent and some of the action is fun to watch.  It is also above par for Robin Williams.  But if you're considering getting this for your children, consider the book instead.
B00005J6T0|4.0|This disc is now remastered, I think that True Blue marks a turning point to those discs before it,and the discs after.(up to Music) It shows a mature confident Madonna ready to take on the world in a new way,this is seen by the progression afterwards.Anyway with out being to technical there are some fine pop tunes ,especially the controversial \\"Papa Don't Preach\\",And the ballad \\"Live to Tell\\",and my favorite \\"True Blue\\".This disc also has a two tracks of extra remixes of \\"True Blue\\", And \\"La Isla Bonita\\" The later a great song performed in concert(not on this disc) for those lucky ones out there who get to see her. This is definitely a must have for any Madonna or pop fan. Ant. ...
0385501560|4.0|Palahniuk with such successful titles as &quot;Fight Club&quot;(First rule of fight club, do not talk about fight club)and survivor, this book is an exceptionally well written novel, even more bizzare then his last three works.  The main character, Victor, is a con artist, sex addict, belives he is a direct link to Jesus, and fakes choking in resteraunts to get free meals, and money from people who save him, but he is not crazy.  Palahniuk's latest book is a treat for people who want a bizzare, but at times almost beautiful book.
B00005BL2A|1.0|If your one of those diehard fans who like anything a band puts out, than you'll probably like this disc.  If not, save your money.  The song that best describes this album is &quot;Comatose&quot;.  The first time I listened to this disc I was disappointed and thought it was pretty bad, so the next day I thought I'd listen to it again with an open mind.  This time I thought it was worse.  Contrary to alot of reviews this album is no were close to Violator.  The songs are very dark, slow and boring.  Unfortunately this is going to be one of those cd's that you pull out of your collection after 5 or 10 years, and you say &quot;wow&quot; this cd still looks brand new!

B000002AHM|5.0|I have always been a fan of the guitar greats like Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and of course Jimi Hendrix.  One listen to this album and I was hooked.  I lost all faith in those other guys.  This album features some of the best guitar playing I could have ever imagined.  The trio just took my breath away with the lightning fast finger licks and flammico style.  Buy this album now, it won't be a waste of money.
B00005BL2A|3.0|This &quot;Exciter&quot;, Depeche Mode's latest release, is somewhat similar to &quot;Reveal&quot; - REM's latest. I anxiously awaited the release of both discs and both discs, unaccountably, seem to be garnering rave reviews (Oh my GOD!! This is,like, the bestest CD ever released in the whole wide world!! Depeche Mode's BEST!! and etc..), yet both discs each only have one song that really bears repeated listenings - &quot;Dream On&quot; from &quot;Exciter&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; in REM's case - although DM's &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is starting to grow on me. <br />Being a longtime fan of DM, I was prepared to pop the CD into the player for the first of many listens and be swept up in hook-laden, romantic, atmospheric electronic rock. Instead, I now find myself continually tapping the &quot;skip&quot; button as the songs ramble on for 3-4 minutes without revealing anything recommending another listen. The tedious &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; is a prime example of skip button material. I kept waiting and waiting for a memorable hook, chord change, (anything!), but to no avail. I'm comatose in the Zombie Room.<br />I'll give it another listen, though, and I'll listen to REM's &quot;Reveal&quot; a few more times as well. I'm a fairly optimistic person, and I'm still hoping to hear the discs that the authors of all those 5-star reviews are hearing...
6303109950|5.0|This film should stand the test of time and become a true western classic - a difficult task since there have been so many well-made OK Corral films before this.  Fine acting all around although the hat should be tipped to Val Kilmer for his brilliant and thoroughly entertaining portrayal of the dying Doc Holliday.  Kurt Russell also turns in a great performance in the lead role as Wyatt Earp.  Russell did not garner as much praise for his part as Kilmer did, but we should keep in mind that Kilmer's character was given a lot of clever and witty lines to deliver, while Russell's was more serious.  Russell shows his maturity as an actor in giving a more understated rendition of Wyatt Earp (not a trigger-happy, foul-mouthed, braggart that we might have expected.)  <br />Together with a great supporting cast including Sam Elliot as Virgil Earp and Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp, you really feel as though you got to know the characters.  They are not just gunslingers.  They have feelings, and they are different from each other.  Overall a fine western.  Not sure why it got an R rating though.  Sure, there's lots of violence, but nothing anymore outrageous than other PG13 films I have seen.
6302798450|5.0|This has to be my most favorite of the Evil Dead series.  Not because it's scary like the first movie, because it's incredibly funny.  I like \\"The Evil Dead\\", and I rate it as my most favorite scary films of all time, but \\"Army of Darkness\\" is the one I like the most.  We see our reluctant hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) being sucked into a vortex in the \\"Evil Dead: Dead By Dawn\\" and he lands in another time during the Middle ages.  Here the deadites are known through out the land where superstition runs rampant in the hearts of men and women.  Ash, is sent back in time as foretold in prophecy and recorded within the pages of The Necronimican, roughly translated, The Book of The Dead.  He is equipped with a chainsaw in place of his severed hand and is armed with his BOOM stick.  From here, the main story line of \\"The Army of Darkness\\" begins.  Upon his landing in the Middle Ages, the primitives, King Arthur's people, mistakens Ash as one of King Henry's men.  So they throw Ash in the pit of the dead where he battles two deadites.  Here we see for the first time the warrior Ash, as he emrges victorious against the evil deadites.  This is really different from the first movie where we see a cowardly Ash who is scared senseless.  Anyway, he frees King Henry and a few of his men who where captured and is hailed as the promised one as foretold in prophecy.  Ash, being the reluctant hero, just wants to go home, so he strikes a deal with the wisemen and sets off on a journey to a cemetary to find the Necronomican, the book that contains the passages to get him back to his own time.  During the first part of his journey, we see the deadites lurking about in the woods reminiscent of the first two films.  He also battles little evil Ashes and a full grown evil Ash when he grows out of good Ash's body.  This is really funny stuff.  Anyway, he finally arrives at the cemetary where he has to choose between 3 Necronomicans.  Let's say he didn't choose wisely.  When he finally grabs theright book, he awakens the army of darkness because he didn't say the verse, the passage from The Necronomican which keeps the dead... dead, exactly right.  He then has to battle the army of darkness, protect the book from the evil Ash which led the army of darkness, and save the girl from the baddies.  There are two endings to this film.  I personally like the S-mart ending better than the awakening in the post Nuclear holocaust future.  I have copies of both endings, but the S-mart ending is my favorite one.  It also sets up the story for the \\"Evil Dead: Hail To The King\\" video game.  I recommend this film for anyone who wants a good laugh with elements of horror.  \\"Hail to the king baby.\\"
B00005J6T0|5.0|How do you improve on an already great album, you remaster it and include two very good remixes that were not included on the non-remastered version.  That's what Madonna accomplished on the remastered album, &quot;True Blue&quot;, this album was already great when it was released in 1986, but now the remastered version once again captures the magic of the original album, and also making it even better with the remixes of &quot;True Blue&quot;, and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, now listed as tracks 10 and 11, respectively, both remixes are great, I liked both equally.  Now I have both original and remastered versions I plan to buy the remastered versions of &quot;Madonna&quot; &amp; &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, this was a great idea Madonna had and on &quot;True Blue&quot;, the album and songs on the album holds up very well, even 15 years after its original release, once again Madonna does no wrong.

B00005BL2A|4.0|I've had this album for two days now, and my first impression is that they ventured way out into some new sonic territory with producer Mark Bell. This is a new DM sound quite unlike anything we've heard before from them, yet the atmosphere remains quite familiar somehow. I think that this album is everything that Ultra was not: tight, energetic, focused... Ultra was more spacious, as if then-producer Tim Simenon was trying to emulate the dark epic atmosphere that ex-member Alan Wilder created (but without the massive amounts of reverb). I think Exciter feels more plastic and synthetic, like a Bjork record, with more experimental beats and twisted synth lines. I suppose it is a more progressive sound, another Ultra-like album would sound dated now. All in all, a refreshing change, and it comes together well. And Ultra was a bit slow wasn't it? Okay, so most people probably won't be so focused on the production as on the songs themselves, so here is my opinion...<br />Martin Gore has written some great songs on Exciter and I think it is a much more varied album than Ultra. His writing has changed even from the days of SOFAD, it seems more mature, more reserved almost. Nothing on here has the same immediate thrill of a song like Personal Jesus, at least not yet, but the songs feel more substantial, more intimate. Check out Breathe and I am You to see what I mean, also check out Dead of Night, a new glam anthem that is one of the album's highlights.<br />Dave Gahan delivers the best singing I've ever heard from him on this album. His vocals are absolutely fantastic, apparently the vocal training he has been doing is paying off, though he has always been a great singer (it just seemed like he was getting hoarse in the early nineties). Check out Shine and, well... pretty much all of the songs he sings on. And Martin, as always, sounds wonderful in his choirboy-gone-bad way.<br />Depeche Mode may never surpass the work they did with Wilder, but that's probably just as well. Every great band has a golden age that they look back to, even if they are still creating great music. I think they have enough distance from the Wilder years now to get out from under their own shadow, and albums like Exciter should encourage true Mode fans and bring in some new ones.
630018403X|5.0|One thing I love about the 80'S is the teen flicks that were made in that decade. Unfortunately, I'm a 17-year-old teenager growing up in the 90's decade, and I'm reduced to watching terrible 90's teen flicks. When people ask me what my favorite teen flick is, I always respond, &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; &quot;Isn't that a movie made in the eighties?&quot; &quot;Yes. Compared to 90's teen movies, 80's teen movies win by a landslide.&quot;  This wonderful movie is hilarious. We are treated to a wonderful cast, funny dialogue, and an airtight plot. You all know what the movie is about. What I really love is the characters- we can really see how each character differ from each another, yet they grow to be friends. One of my most favorite things about this movie is the lines they throw at each other. Especially Bender- he had me laughing from start to end!! &quot;I feel empty inside. I admire guys who roll around with other guys.&quot; &quot;I want to be like you. All I need is a lobotomy and some tights.&quot; &quot;Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?&quot; &quot;Screws fall out. The world's an imperfect place.&quot; &quot;That's very nice, sir, but what if there's a fire?

Who could forget the dancing scene in the library? Who could forget the time when they all confessed their deepest secrets to each other? It's a wonderful, funny and sweet movie. It couldn't be more engaging. All of you who hasn't seen this movie, rent it immediately!!!!!!! It won't be a waste of your time, trust me.

B000056K04|5.0|So, to begin with... I've been a DMB fan for several years now.  When I first listened to Everyday...  I didn't know what to expect.  It wasn't the same Dave that I had grown to love from such songs as Ants Marching, and Crash Into Me.  It was different, and I admit I didn't like the CD the first couple of times I listened to it.  Sure I liked a few songs...I Did It, and Angel.  But that was it.     So, Everyday has been out for a few months now, and I like this CD better than some of the band's live stuff.  Space Between has really grabbed my attention.  The song is an out to life: &quot;The space between what's right and wrong Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you.&quot;     Also, enjoy some of Dave's exciting electric guitar riffs, not previously captured by acoustic.  This is an excellent CD to have  in any collection.  And if you have the chance...  Catch DMB on the summer tour, already started.  Thank you.  And I love Dave!!!
B00000K31Q|5.0|OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO my God! This is the best movie that ever walked the planet! I absolutely love this movie.  It's sassy, funny, realistic, and loveable.  I have seen this movie about 1 million times, and I love it each time I watch it!  You may think you're in for another stupid, pointless teenie-bopper flick, but you are WRONG! You really want Kat(Stiles) and Patrick(Ledger)to get together.  The characters are sincere and loveable.  The 411 is that this movie is based upon \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" by Shakespeare.  Bianca can't date until her sister Kat does because their pops is paranoid. Kat is a really boy-hater unfortunately, so Bianca's crush pays Patrick Verona (Ledger)to \\"tame\\" the witch. While attempting to seduce Kat for a little cash, Patrick begins to fall for her.  Don't miss what happens!  Trust me it is the funniest, most loveable movie you'll ever see!
B00005B36H|5.0|Some people may say that this album is weaker than Tool's previous efforts, mainly because it isn't as heavy. Well, indeed, in some places this album isnt as heavy as aenima. That in itself concerned me at first, but after listening through a few times i realized that this effort is their most thought provoking and impressive piece of work to date.  It should be listened to several times before a decision is made on whether or not this is their &quot;masterpiece&quot;.  A first impression of this album, is not necessarily the right one.  Tool's lyrics and unique sounds grow on the listener more than any metal band, or any other rock band for that matter.  Do yourself a favor and listen to this album through as much as it takes to know the songs before you write your review.  It may be different than aenima and undertow, but who wants the same album released more than once?  Definitely a solid 5 out of 5 stars.

0066620694|1.0|This book is very much in the &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; school.<br />It reminds me of the university textbook written by the professor.  You HAVE to buy it because you are to be examined on the contents.  Thus the professor makes a fine profit from an otherwise unsaleable book.<br />I found it indigestible, and full of truisms.  It seems an amalgam of so many other books.  Nice work if you can get it.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|A very German tourist tourist is abandoned by her travelling companion in the middle of the desert with just her luggage and a thermos of very strong coffee.She makes her way to the kind of roadside motel that seems to hover on the brink  of self destruction ,peopled by an eclectic cast of characters of whom Jack Palance as an artist who brings our tourist out of herself and the foul-tempered owner played by CCH Pounder trying to cope with the failing business and her off the wall family are outstanding.As the tourist Marianne Sagebrecht is just sufficiently alien to force each person with whom she comes in contact to re evaluate their own sense of themselves as they try to understand her values.They even have trouble understanding her coffee. This is a movie about people living with people .It is warm,funny,understanding and generates that magic so rarely seen in current Hollywood offerings that gives one a real sense of loss when the credits roll.This review is based on a letterbox laser disc .
0679805273|5.0|The 'timelessness' of Dr Seuss' books is epitomized in &quot;Oh the places you'll go&quot;. I read it when I was 4, again at 13, again at 21 and now in my late 20s and going through a career change, I've reached for its ageless wisdom yet again. Interpret the messages how you may whatever success means for you (materialistic,social status,spiritual happiness), it is a story that reaches all ages, all values, at all levels, cultures, religions and communities. An Incredibly uplifting tale that at the same time acknowledges our reality and foibles. A book that is the essence of human being.
0792844882|5.0|let us be frank; this film is bad  very very bad   but thats where the magic happens.  this production is that rare gem which dares to be so very very bad thats its wonderful!<br />Am told that the lead actress was sold this project on the basis that she would become the &quot;next Sharon Stone&quot;  To say the least this proposal backfired, in fact she couldnt get work upon the release of this atrocity, but what a treat for the rest of us!   Every rediculous stereotype and plotline, every badly delivered, horribly concieved line is packed into this disc.  Not a frame is wasted.  Sure, Elizabeth can be eyecandy, but thats just a bonus compared to the numerous scenes intended to be drama which in fact come across wonderfully hysterical.  To me what further adds to the comedy is the great audio producton and cinematography used to capture the silliness.<br />  Not for the kids, but if you want without a doubt one of the greatest wonderfully bad films ever devised, order this at once, and dig in!
0385501560|5.0|What we have here is a novelist whose time will never come.  Chuck Palahniuk will never be as praised as he deserves to be, and I for one hope that this never changes.  From Invisible Monsters to Fight Club, Survivor, and now Choke; I look on the bestseller lists, and I'm glad to not to have to see his name.  For those fortunate enough to have read and enjoyed his previous work, you will hardly be disappointed.  The narrative is constantly babbling in your ear like some deranged lunatic, but it is so well-balanced that, like everything else Chuck has written,  it starts to make perfect sense.  And then it happens: it's called a changeover, and the audience has no clue.  In this book you will be asked questions, and you will ask yourself questions.  You will be presented with perspective, and just as quickly it will be taken away.  You will laugh and cringe all in the same note.  It's hard to make reference to anything without wanting to spew it all out.  Suffice it to say that when reading this book, be careful not to confuse the narrator's voice with your own...
0684847248|2.0|While some of his words rang true, Peck's overall upity attitude, his pretense of extravagent knowledge, and his downright maddening assuptions make me want to throw the book across the room. Unfourtunatly, I must read it for school. THe first sections were bearable, even interesting, though redundant sometimes too cynicle, and frequently too obviously praising of himself. THe second section was unbearable, the piece on science and religion and the part on grace were obviously written by anoverzealous christian who is convinced that the rest of the world, like him, must believe in God. He assumed that religion is more open minded than relgion, gave an extremely in scientific view of entropy and evolution, and presented absurd claims about how we are supposed to become god, all good things are proff of God, and that laziness is the original sin. If you must, read the first part, but while your ahead, I advise you to put the rest in the recycle bin.
B000020617|5.0|There are not many cd's I can just pop in and let play from start to finish (except maybe greatest hits) but this is one I can. All the songs are very melodic, have a nice edge to them and keep the listener interested. My favorites? &quot;Stacked Actors, Breakout, Learn To Fly, Gimme Stiches, and Next Year&quot;. This is the best Foo Fighters cd yet!
B0000507R0|4.0|admittedly am a bit biased to liking this one, as am a professional keyboardist, and Keith Emerson (in my opinion the greatest rock keyboardist of all time) was my inspriration to play the moment I first heard his version of &quot;Hoedown&quot;<br />I know that some have felt the original ELP recordings had great production   I have often felt different; that they lacked true low end, and high end clarity   This remix addresses both of those issues wonderfully   in fact, depending on how you have EQ'd your system, the bass may actually get to &quot;overkill&quot; levels (I had set up my system with Steely Dan DTS and Eagles DTS mixes as references, and this disc came through with earthshaking (literally) moments of bass   not necessarily a bad thing at times)   must say, its nice to hear Keith's Moog lines re-engineered with the power and clariy they deserve<br />this remix takes full advantage of the 3D aspect of 6 channels   lots of panning all around, especially of the synth leads   it happens a lot, to the point where one might wonder if the remix is just sweeping the panning for the novelty of it, but still, if you are hoping for ELP in the third audio dimension, you will surely have it<br />there is one disappointment for me in the production (hense the 4 stars instead of 5 which most others seem to have bestowed); while the bass guitar is huge in the subwoofer channel, Carl's kickdrum is oddly absent   that would have added such a great addtional power to this wonderful revisiting of great musicians at work<br />That one point aside, in short, if you are ELP fan (this disk opens up this classic recording like never before), and/or if you are looking for a show-off 3D audio dvd audio disk, stop reading and hit the &quot;order&quot; button immediately!

B000001EAQ|1.0|I still have this CD and every once in awhile I pop it in to see if maybe by some miracle I am missing something in my opinion that this is the worst cd U2 ever made. Every time I do I just reassure myself that this is indeed the worst thing they ever put out. Innovative?, Exciting?, Dynamic? No, just a boring piece of [junk].
B00003CXP1|5.0|I just saw Requiem for a Dream this afternoon and speaking  as a future film maker myself,I thought the movie rocked! But can we spell &quot;comfortably numb&quot; from pink floyd's  the wall,and the film sid and nancy? Don't get me wrong I liked the way Darren Aronofsky used disturbing to the  point of sickness images to portray his story.The dvd is  good because he is able to give his insight as to what the  film was actually about instead of most of the abstract  images that are thrown at you for 102 minutes.This film was a treat for me because I'm a huge fan of both Jared  Leto and Jennifer Connelly.I thought their performances were more than exemplary.This gave them the opportuninty to shed the images that each portrayed as teen idols-for Jared-&quot;My so called life, and for her-goody,goody family films like &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;.Marlon Wayans of course provided the comic relief in the film as I thought he would,but he did have  a volitle role in the film as their best-getting-high-every- day-buddy.Since I was born in the late seventies,I'm not  that familiar with Ellen Burstyn's work,however I thought  she deserved the oscar nod that she got for this particular role as Jared's mom.People actually have addictions like her character,so I thought that was important to show how  people let perscription drugs get the best of them.As for the 'Wall' reference I made earlier,like the rock opera, by the end of the film each of the characters in Reqiuem descends deeper into maddness than when the film begins. And this movie shows you how badly heroine can send you  packing on a one way trip to hell in style.And the movie is loaded with sid and nancy isms because we all know that&quot;the couple that uses together stays together&quot; is the basis of jared and  jennifer's characters.So I'd like to say in conclusion, Darren Aronofsky has given us something to remember for the next 20 years or so for groundbreaking movies like this one. When they look back at what was the most controversial, they would have to say &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;.

B00005B36H|5.0|You saw my title, this CD is fantastic.  The drums are stepped up a notch, and Danny does his part PERFECTLY.  Being a drummer this is what i have been hearing for, but I noticed how well the guitars are played too, and dont forget Maynard, he sings perfectly for every song.  Each track is something else.  I dont want to spoil anything for those of you who havent heard the CD yet.  Not only is the music superb, but the album art is cool too.  I had expected something cool after seeing other Tool CDs, and i was blown away.  Only problem is I cant stop listening to it, and its been hogging my CD player.  All my other CDs are getting jealous.  ;p  GOOD CD BUY IT!!

B000002N2Z|5.0|The Deftones have exploded on to the music scene with this abrasive and ingenious album, developing their own genre and tearing all other bands (ie. Korn, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, Godsmack, etc.) to shreds!  Obviously, I'm righting this review a few years after &quot;Adrenaline&quot; was released, but it's impact is still felt today.  Stef cranks out heavy riffs and power chords like it's his job, and the rest of the band is brilliant.  If you don't own this album you're missing out on the evolution of rock/metal!
0812550706|5.0|When I started and finished Enders Game, I was certain that Orson Scott Card had written one of the greatest science fiction series since Isaac Asimov's &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot;.  I was, however, disappointed by the following books in the series.  Enders Game, though, stands on its own as a masterpiece in the genre.  It has deservedly won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and has been one of the most popular science fiction books of all times since its publication.  Enders Game is probably my favorite Card book (standing close to Songmaster, The Worthing Saga, and Seventh Son).  I highly recommend to adult readers and teens (and younger... I first read the book when I was 12).  I hope you enjoy.
0345404475|4.0|I found this to almost be a short story (maybe it is).  It was nice because even though it is a pretty short book, it doesn't try to do too much.  It really only has 1-2 &quot;real&quot; characters, but it pulls that off very well.
B0000508U6|1.0|I never buy cd's.  Do you know why?  You take a big chance on  not liking them and then you can't return them.  Parachutes is no exception.  This is an example of one good song and the rest is filler.  After &quot;Yellow&quot; the rest of the cd is just one long, boring, slow, drone after another.  All of the songs sound exactly alike and no. 7 is 20 seconds long.  Spend your money on something else.  I'm amazed at how good the other reviews are. They must have been written by...or the band.
B000002NIW|5.0|From start to finish &quot;Around the Fur&quot; demonstrates the sheer brilliance and genius of the Deftones.  In my opinion no other rock album in history has been as explosive and artistic. The Deftones create their own genre of music with &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, one which is so incredibly unique it's often immitated but never replicated.  Stef and Chi produce some of music's hardest and edgiest riffs known to date, and Chino's angelical and raw vocals combined with Abe's beat produce the heavy-groove-metal style that the Deftones have invented!  Every song on the album leaves the listener hungry for more.  'My Own Summer' opens the album with such intensity and emotion, one can't stop listening.  The natural ability of Chino to express beauty and ruthlessness in his vocals is unprecedented.  Meanwhile, Stef, Chi and Abe crank out monumental riffs and beats.  Top tracks include 'My Own Summer', 'Around the Fur', 'Lotion', and 'Headup', but they're all awesome.  The album is overlooked as &quot;hardcore&quot;, however I would boast it as one of the heaviest albums ever.  The bottomline is that &quot;Around the Fur&quot; is one of the few truely unique and elite rock albums ever released.  A must have cd!

B00000JZIK|5.0|...was making some people think this movie was NOT worth every bit of praise it received, and then some.  This film is a brilliant masterstroke--for director Bryan Singer, for writer Christopher McQuarrie, for all the cast of exceptional actors, and most notably, for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for finally getting it right.<br />Kevin Spacey steals your mind, logic, and ability to think of anything else than you just sitting back and following his tale of just WHO this Keyser Soze really is.<br />Some say the final scene kills the film; others say it perfectly caps off a brilliant plot-twister.  However you wish to see it, remember this when you get to that point in the picture:  you have been absolutely glued to this film, almost afraid to blink.  You, too, have fallen into Soze's world, and you, too, have been conned!!!<br />&quot;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was making the world believe he didn't exist.&quot;  You shall see the greatest trick in this film is Spacey's ability to completely stare straight and tell &quot;the truth.&quot;  HA HA HA HA<br />The film's editing was sorely overlooked for awards--the quick motion makes the difficult story easy to follow, and keeps the flow of the crime mystery going.  The tight dialogue is great--filled with one-liners you'll be saying for weeks.  The cinematography is amazing, as is the moving score which evokes the old noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s.  Gabriel Byrne is in top, intense form, as is the unlikely pair of Kevin Pollack and Stephan Baldwin.  At the time, Benicio Del Toro was himself a newcomer, but you wouldn't guess it from his performance.  Theatrical oldtimer Pete Postlethwaite is amazing, as is Chazz Palmintieri...I can't say it enough!  EVERYONE IN THIS FILM IS GREAT!  THIS FILM IS GREAT!  I wish there were more films out there like this.<br />I won't tell you who Keyser Soze is:  you must discover that on your own.  But I will tell you this...if you haven't seen this, then WHAT the heck are you waiting for?  Even if you do have a &quot;fried drumstick&quot; for a leg, hobble on it as you run to get this film!
0679879269|3.0|What a shame that this book didn't live up to the potential it had to offer, given the scene that had been set by the prequels (Northern Lights/Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife). <br />I confess particular fondness of the subject material in these books as I myself was a student in Turl Street, Oxford, reading physics - aka experimental theology - and now an ex-christian.<br />I read the three books one after the other and I agree with several other reviewers that the first two books were superb in their development of characters and personalities, the discussion of ideas, the clever storylines and the tempo of the narratives. <br />You can imagine how keen I was to start the Amber Spyglass when a few dozen pages in, I suddenly discovered I was losing interest in the whole enterprise. Whereas I couldn't put down the other books, this one started to bore me almost immediately. I felt that the logical consistency of the first two books was being unravelled in this one, there are sudden changes in ideas and personalities and the whole story becomes piecemeal. There are some characters which are almost bogus (Father Gomez) and he could even have got away without using the world of the mulefa. There is more than one occasion where there is confusion in the plot, with the abilities of various spectres, daemons, ghosts and angels and so on. I feel that several times Pullman uses sleight of hand, explaining some inconsistency away with an almost flippant one-line explanation. Throughout I got the feeling that he was 'losing the plot', perhaps that he was trying to finish the book off too quickly and to hell with the consistency.<br />Having said all this, there are moments of brilliance in this book and the interaction between Will and Lyra is handled very well, indeed it's been a long time since I have read such a heart-wrenching end to a book. <br />Other reviewers have mentioned the swipes he takes at Christianity and I must say that I don't agree with them. In fact Pullman attacks the narrow-minded unkindness found in a *religious* mentality. Young people reading this book will probably be positively affected by that view whereas they can make up their own mind at some stage about the theological 'heresies' of God not being creator etc. It is a work of fiction after all. <br />Brilliant though the Dark Materials trilogy is, it needs to remain that - a trilogy. The story has been finished off beautifully and any attempt to further the project would be detrimental to the whole work. <br />Finally, I'd like to say that if this last book had been of the same quality as the first two we would have on our hands a true classic of English literature, a work to rival or exceed Lord of the Rings. All the same though, a wonderful read and one I will treasure for a long time.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Every time I wanted to buy a new DVD I had second thoughts about this movie. Well those thoughts were over when I saw this movie for the first time. Excellent movie, excellent acting. This two hour movie will make you happy but, will also make you sad. This movie shows you that there is one thing you have to do; ENJOY YOUR LIFE!!
6304398395|3.0|The star of this film is the amazing replications of Chaplin's use of physical comedy and intense passion for filmmaking the &quot;tramp&quot; had for his craft.  Robert Downey, Jr. literally steals the show away from such heavyweights as Anthony Hopkins and the film's director, Richard Attenborough.  <br />Though Attenborough, he himself an Oscar winning director, does some clever things to draw you into the world of Chaplin (making the film look old and distressed, using the same shakey &quot;hand-cranking&quot; speeds for action sequences, and use of moody, uneven lighting), his tempo for the film seems painfully slow at times, and at over two hours, the picture feels much longer. <br />The film is packed with stars in small roles, as everyone plays second banana to Chaplin--Marisa Tomei, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovney, Dan Akroyd, Moira Kelly, and Geraldine Chaplin, just to name a few. The period accuracy is well done, and the acting is superb, however, the direction is heavy-handed--a major fault of Attenborough's other films, too, and leaves you feeling frustrated--just show more of Chaplin doing what he does best--making people laugh!<br />To his credit, however, the director does show Chaplin as the social activist who had an FBI file close to 2,000 pages in length.  The drama, at times, seemed a bit much for someone known for bringing joy to so many...perhaps, therein lies the irony of Chaplin's life.  See this film to be educated, and see it to see Robert Downey, Jr. in top form in this Oscar nominated performance and ode to one of cinema's greatest artists who was the forerunner for such &quot;control freaks&quot; as Warren Beatty and Orson Wells.  Writer, director, actor, producer, editor...Chaplin did it all!
B000058T5E|5.0|From the song &quot;Nadia&quot; on, Beck astounds with the tones he and only he can coax out of a guitar. And this is not just guitar grandstanding - these songs take you places. To me, this is Beck's best effort yet.
B00003CX95|5.0|For me, this is the best movie ever made. It has everything an excellent story, great acting, the best customs. And do not forget Horners' great soundtrack. The story about William Wallace and his battle for freedom will be in your thoughts forever. You can keep watching this movie again and again.  But watch out, after the three hours you will be very depressed, and I'am not even Scottish. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't waste your time anymore, buy it!!!
0790729709|4.0|First off I'd like to mention that even though it lists the remastered soundtrack as one of the special features, it doesn't mean that it is has the actual soundtrack included, it just means the scenes of the movie with music are remastered. This DVD isn't really good as far as special features, but the movie is as good as it was 10 years ago. Whitney is excellent in her film debut, and Kevin is no worse than he usually is. The only big problem with this movie is that Whitney's character, Rachel, curses more than half the time. If you have a child that you don't think is old enough to listen to Whitney Houston saying the F word, I suggest you tape this off TV (it's always on) and watch that copy when with your child, as they always edit the curses out. Other than these things, this movie is excellent, suspenseful, romantic, and gives you insight into the dangerous life of a superstar. If you like these things, or just like Whitney, or, umm, Kevin, you will love this movie, just don't expect \\"I'm Every Woman\\" to show up anywhere, it doesn't.

0553565915|5.0|This profound book has changed not only my ideas and thoughts about life after death but also and more importantly, about living.  Love, compassion, and giving of oneself are the basic principles of life and many things (good and bad)happen to help lead us to reach our potential in these attributes.  If we can look at life with a different perspective and realize that the love that surrounds us now will also be with us after death, it makes it easier to accept the death of a loved one or a difficult circumstance.  There's a reason and a season for everything; Betty says that these are things that help us in our spiritual journey.<br />I haven't read any other NDE books yet but this one is a must for anyone who needs uplifted.  Even though some of it seems far fetched and a little odd, the basic precepts are simple.  The first chapters were dull compared with the rest of the book - I couldn't put it down til finished.  It certainly made me more comfortable knowing that those who've been so important in my life will be around me again when I'm gone (from the Earth).  It has also made me more aware of the impact those people have had on my life and what direction I need to take because of that person.  I snuggle with my son (3) and daughter(1) every night thanking God for giving them to me and believing they are my closest soulmates.  I think everyday about how I can grow spirtually and help them learn to love and have compassion for others.  I also struggle with thoughts of something terrible happening to them which, I'm sure all parents deal with and pray is not in my spiritual journey.  Anyway, read this book.
630587493X|3.0|Movie Summary:  The Martins buy a robot and name him Andrew. Andrew turns out to be very special. He strives over the course of 200 years to find out who he is. What he finds is that more than anything, he wants to be human.<br />My Opinion:  This was a really nice story. The problem I had was that it was a lot more fun when Andrew looked like a robot. Once he turned into Robin Williams, I couldn't buy him as a Robot anymore. He didn't walk, talk, or act like a robot anymore. Now maybe that was the point, but it didn't work for me.<br />DVD Quality:  Great picture and sound. Extras include trailer and making of documentary. It's anamorphic which is near and dear to the hearts of all 16:9 TV or monitor owners out there.<br />What You Should Do:  Rent it. I really can't see this one appealing to either SciFi fans or Robin Williams fans enough for them to buy it without seeing it first. It is a nice family movie. Nothing too offensive or vulgar.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Arrival is the kind of album that gets your attention.Guitar playing like the stuff on this album rarely is heard in today's music and if folks want to get their emotions jumpstarted this is the place to start. As much as I like and appreciate Steve Perry's singing, his departure from JOURNEY has allowed Schon  and Cain to utilize all of their musical talents and the result is this versitle collection of super songs.Too many people are making the focus of Journey's revival &quot;Steve Augeri vs. Steve Perry&quot;.While it's true,[and by design],that S. Augeri sounds alot like S.PERRY on the hits played at concerts,on ARRIVAL he displays his ability to sing in a variety of styles.Whether it's a rocker, a soulful ballad, a bluesy number,or a jazz influenced piece S.Augeri does a fine job and, if truth be known, is a more versitile singer than S.Perry is. If the true measure of a great album is that the more you listen to it the better it seems to get, then the fact that I slide ARRIVAL into the C.D. player whenever I want a lift must mean it's reached that higher place.
B00005ASOC|4.0|Movie Summary:  A 16 year old black kid from the Bronx stumbles across a reclusive author who had a Pulitzer winning novel 40 years before and hadn't been heard from since. They end up pulling each other out of their shells. The kid is scared to let his friends see that he is smart. The author is scared of everything.<br />My Opinion:  This was a really touching movie. The only problem I have with it is that the trailer gave everything away. I know that's not the fault of the movie, but it would have been a lot better had I not seen the trailer six months before in the theater. Do not watch the trailer before you watch the movie. This is a good rule in general. Sean Connery is awesome. He just keeps getting better. Rob Brown is amazing in his first role ever. The mix of academics and basketball is very well done. I enjoyed both.<br />DVD Quality:  It's anamorphic so I was happy. There are a bunch of extras which are nice. I didn't notice the picture or sound being good or bad because I was too into the movie.<br />What You Should Do:  See it for sure. I'd probably put this movie in the \\"try it before you buy it\\" category. Yes there are people out there who buy DVDs without seeing the movie first. Right Rhett? Don't worry about the Good Will Hunting comparisons. They are not that much alike. Make up your own mind.
6304806434|1.0|Cage is transformed into an invincible killing machine only after he attended the Marines. He is so unstoppable, not even bullets can flinch him.  I would like to ask aeronautic engineers if there is a plane like the one in ConAir.  If there really is, my goodness, we could wipe out an entire country with this one plane.  I don't think even bombs could scratch it.  I know movies exaggerate reality, but there has to be SOME limits drawn.  The plane took a beating and kept on going, and Cage was virtually a Superman.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|This DVD contains the first series - 4 hours on two discs - of *Queer as Folk* as it was originally seen on television in the U.K.  I hesitated for awhile, wondering whether it was worth the rather steep price for two discs.  (Actually, I didn't know how many discs there were -- search as you might, I dare you to find that information here).  Plus, I wasn't crazy about the what I saw of the U.S. version. Finally, I'm always scared by films and television from the U.K. because the regional accents are often indecipherable to my Yankee ear.  Anyway, I bought it and I'm glad I did.<br />First, I had no problem with the accents or the regional idioms.  All the &quot;shagging&quot; and &quot;wanking&quot; wore off on me a bit, actually. (&quot;Do you think ov'im when you av'a wank?  No?  Then ee's your Boyfriend alright.&quot;) The teleplay is flawless.  Other reviewers are better at synopsis than I am.  The point is, it's how the story's told that really sells this.<br />The ensemble cast, led by Aiden Gillen, Craig Kelly, and Charlie Hunnam is terrific.  Where the U.S. show had guys who really looked good but weren't very interesting, this show has more or less normal, but still good looking guys who look better and better as you get to know them.  As Stuart, Aiden Gillen, for example, plays a character who &quot;doesn't even have to work for it.&quot;  But it's not so much that he's a god, physically, it's rather his attitude, which is so much more complicated than the voracious party boy he pretends to be.  Craig Kelly broke my heart as Vince, Stuart's best friend, who apparently has been smitten by Stuart since they were both 12.  And Charlie Hunnam swipes every scene he's in as Nathan, the 15 year old who starts out as a victim-waiting-to-happen, and ends up a hero, both to himself and to his adopted community.  The setting is realistic too:  straight people who run the gamut from insane homophobes to fellow-travelers; and gay people who have carved for themselves a community, but who have also found out that the world isn't &quot;Will and Grace&quot; and liberation is an inside job.<br />This show never panders to those who want easy or politically correct answers, or who want everything to be tied up nicely in a bow.  Instead, it overflows with insight.  Inthe U.S. version, this seems mere melodrama.  Here, it works on so many dramatic levels.  One of the best things to be said about it is that it truly is &quot;made for t.v.&quot;  Which is to say that it totally exploits and expands the medium.  I could no more imagine this on the big screen than on the stage.  It does, in other words, everything that T.V. should do and none of the things it shouldn't.<br />There's a lot of sex in the show, some of it more steamy than most U.S. viewers have ever seen on the tube (not counting HBO), but it's never played for shock value.  It propels the story.  It's honest. And yes, it's erotic.<br />So the bottom line is, this is a very fine show, and you're not likely to see it if you don't buy it.  So if you *can* afford it, you probably should.ves a community, but who have also found out that the world isn't &quot;Will and Grace&quot; and liberation is an inside job.<br />This show never panders to those who want easy or politically correct answers, or who want everything to be tied up nicely in a bow.

B0000024SI|5.0|That's most peculiar.  This album must appear on anyone's short list of &quot;greatest rock and roll albums of all time.&quot;  It's Dylan at his most intense and electrifying -- and that's rarefied air.
0060392886|5.0|Motley Crue's own members deliver a tantalizing account of excess and torment in the whirlpool of the music business.  From the streets of LA to stadiums, Motley did it harder, faster, and badder than any other band.  The accounts of sex, drugs, and mischief surrounding their songwriting process and touring will leave you crying one minute, laughing the next.  This book is great!!
B00001MXXG|4.0|Have to disagree with the editorial review on this one. I'm 31, and a high school teacher now (ironic, yes?) and when I've shown this film to various groups of late-90s and early 21st century 14-16 year olds, they still relate to this film in a big way and get as much out of it as we ever did.<br />It's a wonderfully well-balanced mix of comedy and growing-up-landmark moments, and the music choices, as ever with Hughes' so-called \\"teen flicks\\", are superb. The highlight for me is the Dream Academy's stunning instrumental version of The Smiths' \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" (in the art gallery scene)...<br />The disc itself is quite good, with a terrific commentary track from John Hughes, full of his amazingly clear memories of the making of the film. What else could it have? Perhaps some of the deleted scenes and so on which Hughes makes reference to in his commentary would have rounded out the extras rather better. Besides that, this is a remarkably good package for a film now almost the same age as its heroic protagonist and which was forever labelled with that throwaway, almost derogatory term, \\"teen flick\\". That makes it sound so disposable. I've yet to meet any fan of it from my generation who truly thinks it ever will be.<br />So, erm, harrumph, where is the Pretty In Pink disc now, Paramount? :)
0440219078|5.0|I just read this book and it is fantastic!  One reviewer recommended it for people from age 8-50, and let me say that I am over that maximum age and still loved it. &quot;Couldn't put it down.&quot;
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is the story of an apparent freak who becomes a beloved superstar and it is one of my favorite Disney films ever (second only to Pinocchio).  I can't wait for the DVD but I don't as eagerly anticipate the planned sequel as I fear it might detract from this film.
B00003CXP1|2.0|This is another example of hype over actual substance.I could'nt help but thinking that i've seen this same film countless times before.This territory has been covered,more effectively,by more talented Directors.The ensemble of drug addicted character's in a perpetual freefall,struggling to find an better life,Yawn.I have to agree with another reviewer,none of the dialogue rings true,the characterizations are totally false,and everyone,save for Ellen Burstyn,is woefully miscast.And all those cheap editing tricks,that can be done on an Mac or PC,detract from the impact of the story.It was totally unnecessary.Usually a director will manipulate images,and utilize various editing techniques if he lacks confidence in his ability to tell a story.How many times do we have to see that little drug montage,and the sped up frame rate?Some people said they could'nt sleep for a time after watching this film.Honestly,i slept like a baby because i felt no sorrow for the characters,they were just a bunch of fools who got what they deserve.I know,i was supposed to feel pity for their worthless lives,i was supposed to be blown away by the PT Anderson/Scorcese images.I'm sorry,but this little endeavor was so overrated it practically brought tears to my eyes.If it was'nt for the average special effects,this could have been an ABC after school special about addiction.I guess The director is getting a pass for his other ovverated film,\\"PI\\",because i could'nt have watched the same movie everyone was praising.It's rumored that Aronofsky is going to direct the next Batman movie.I pray that it is only an rumor,because if you think the last installment was horrendous,just wait until this guy gets a hold of it.Don't Believe the Hype.<br />...
B00004U8H4|5.0|I rented this movie on the spur of the moment and certainly did not regret it! So while in Hungary I bought a Hungarian copy of the DVD and what an investment. And unlike the US the Hungarians have NO rating system at all so I was guarenteed the uncut version! Classic.
B00003CXMG|2.0|While the kid who plays William is good, the rest of the characters invoke apathy at best.  Kate Hudson's character is especially pointless, I never cared one iota about &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.  I spent most of this overly-long movie simply waiting for it to end.<br />The only standout performance was from Jason Lee who was the lead singer of the fictitious band Stillwater.  The soundtrack is also excellent, although you've probably heard all the songs included about 100 times to often.
0800177363|5.0|This was one of the best movies I ever had the pleasure of watching.  It is a true touching story and it is very moving.  Boh Robin Williams and Robert De Niro put forth excellent performances.  Although, Robert DeNiro should take all the glory for this one.  He portrayed his part beyound stellar.  Two Thumbs up all the way!
6300215717|5.0|Nearly fifty years after it was made, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; still brings a gleeful smile of pleasure and delight to its viewer, who will be undoubtedly charmed by this wonderful whimsy of a film. The story of a princess escaping her fairy tale life, and finding her own fairy tale outside the palace with a handsome newsman captivated audiences in 1953, and still does today.<br />In her feature film debut, the delightful Audrey Hepburn shines as the gamine Princess Anne, who, loathing her tiresome, claustrophobic life as a royal family member, escapes from her caretakers while on a royal international tour in Rome. When a young newsman, Joe Bradley, (Gregory Peck) stumbles onto the naive young woman, he realizes who she is, and smelling the scoop of a lifetime, takes her on a holiday through the sights and pleasures of Rome while his photographer buddy Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert) relentlessly shoots pictures with all sorts of camouflaged gadgets. Joe and &quot;Anya&quot; bask in the joys of the lush city, from lunch at a sidewalk cafe (where the princess also enjoys her first cigarette) to a wild escapade on a runaway motorcycle, to a romantic moonlit dance by a lake... and before the pair realizes it, they've fallen for each other, but can they be together... a princess and a commoner?<br />William Wyler directed this Oscar-winning masterpiece, nominated for, among other awards, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Eddie Albert, and winner for Audrey Hepburn as the year's Best Actress for her brilliant, utterly charming princess. A princess, indeed. Hepburn, the beautiful young gamine, is indeed every inch a princess in her sensitive and beautiful portrayal. Gregory Peck's rugged charm and humor are a perfect match for Hepburn, and the chemistry between the two is a joy to watch. The exquisite cinematography is extraordinary to see, even in black-and-white, and the lively script makes for many golden scenes: One scene in the beginning has Hepburn trying to retrieve a lost shoe during an Embassy dance, another has Hepburn getting her first haircut in an Italian salon, and the whole picture is worth the scene in which Peck dares Hepburn to put her hand into the infamous &quot;Mouth of Truth&quot;: &quot;Legend has it that if you're given to lying, it'll bite your hand off.&quot; Slyly demonstrating, he suddenly yells in agony as the terrified Hepburn screams. He brings his arm out with his hand disappeared, and Hepburn shrieks. But suddenly the hand pops through his coat jacket as Hepburn squeals with mock-fury. And the beautiful, beautiful scene by the lake as the two look into each other's eyes while they dance... what a heavenly feeling you get watching that scene alone.<br />It's a charming film, absolutely beautiful. &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; is a movie about two people falling in love, and it's a movie that you will fall in love with too. This is a film to watch again and again with somebody you love... if you do, it's only that much more of a holiday.
0525945636|4.0|From the other reviews it seems I am not the only one with the opinion that Ken Follett's books vary from great (Pillars of the Earth and others) to horribly bad (Night over Water). Unlike some people, however, I think this is a really good one. I enjoy books where you are not 100% sure of who is who and what they are up to, and here not even the hero knows who he is. I'd like to think that I could behave as cool as our friend &quot;Luke&quot; if I ever lost my memory.<br />A little more than halfway through the book, the story unfolds (as it has to, eventually) and it loses a bit from that point onwards. The ending is downright sentimental and should have been better. With a stronger second half, the fifth star would have been there.
0385495323|3.0|If you know the history of how codes (and cyphers) were constructed and deconstructed then this is an interesting review of their history.  The author is not really clear on some of the details and, in the final chapters, is obviously in way over his head.<br />It's OK but I'd get it out of the library or read a review copy.  I don't have it in my library anymore.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|There will always be two schools of thought concerning the film MOULIN ROUGE <br />There will be those who hate it and those who love it.  I am in the later category. <br />MOULIN ROUGE is without question, a landmark achievement of a film. The first 45 minutes alone,rank as some of the most exhilarating moments ever captured on celluloid. Director,Baz Luhrmann creates a world full of color, sound and movement that effect the senses completely. It's impossible not be swept into it and impossible not to step back and note the greatness Mr.Luhrmann possesses as a director. <br />Luhrmann takes every old musical comedy cliché (From &quot;Love me tonight&quot; to &quot;Babes in Arms&quot; and even &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;) and mixes it with operatic storylines (echoes from &quot;Boheme&quot; to &quot;Traviata&quot; abound) and injects them all with a invigorating sense of freshness.  The effect is as if Mr. Luhrmann had never seen a musical comedy or opera  before and had come up with all this by himself while drinking a cappuccino at Starbucks. <br />The inventiveness doesn't end there. Luhrmann sense of music knows no boundaries.  He will take a piece of music by Offenbach and insert Nirvana's &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; into it.  The amazing thing is it makes sense and comes off as if Mr.Offenbach and Mr.Cobain had been formally introduced. <br />During the &quot;Diamonds are a girls best friend&quot; production number, the music morphs for a few moments into Madonna's &quot;Material Girl&quot; thus pointing up the structural similarities between two pieces of music written 40 years apart as well as paying homage to the original performers who performed it. <br />It's a statement, within a statement, within a statement and that happens often in this film and that's called genius, folks. <br />All the actors are quite good with the two leads more than up to the task at hand. <br />From the moment Nicole Kidman enters the frame, one realizes one is watchingan honest to goodness &quot;movie star&quot;.  The word &quot;movie star&quot; has both good and bad connotations and Ms. Kidman is aware of that. She delivers a performance loaded with a screwball comedy timing and offset by touching vulnerability.  More importantly, she looks like she's having fun up there and her serviceably pleasant singing voice works to her advantage. This is the surest and most likable performance she's given on film to date. <br />The real revelation, however, is Ewan MacGregor.  A performance with this much charm, energy, earnestness and naiveté would normally be considered obnoxious in any actor over the age of 11. What MacGregor does though, is imbue every moment of his performance with enough heart and sincerity to make it real.  He believes totally in what he's doing thus making you believe.  It is that sincerity that gives the film it's foundation to rest upon. Also, MacGregor, is one hell of a singer.  His untrained but robust voice is used with a fine sense of musicality and when he volleys up to one of the many high notes in his role (up to and including a rock solid high A), the sheer sense of glee he gives off is infectious. <br />So, in a summer made up of what looks to be mostly mindless fare, where does Moulin Rouge fit in?  Nowhere really.  However, it is more than likely that Moulin Rouge will be discussed, analyzed, probed and used as inspiration long after the &quot;Mummy returns&quot; and &quot;Tomb Raiders&quot; of the world have become but a distant memory. <br />...and that's the important thing.
B0000000LI|1.0|Yanni fans and others have come to expect from him &quot;music&quot; that provokes landscape images, religious symbolism, and cultural...ZZZZZ.ZZZZZZZZZZZ.  Anyway, the fact is his music has never been the same since his departure from german rock band, the Scorpions.  His presence was felt on a few early recordings and fans may have noticed the difference upon its absence.  Yanni has completely left behind all previous styles and taken on a new identity in the world music genre.  The Album is over the top and over long and will definitely take you into another realm - one in which you may not want to be - So Yanni heads will appreciate it.  The only really unique aspect of Acropolis is the out of place appearance of Rob Halford (Judas Priest).  I would really like to know how he agreed to appear on it.  The unknown Twisted Sister cover song is absent once again - It may not even exist on bootleg.  Yanni fans will like this but if you know his metal roots its a little hard to take in.
B00003CXMG|4.0|ALMOST FAMOUS is a well-crafted comedy about writer/director Cameron Crowe's real-life adventures as a precocious teenage rock and roll journalist in the seventies.  It has wit, great pacing and editing, and a big heart.  The music is okay though it can never be mistaken for being the soul of the story; the soul belongs to the characters.  All the characters are fully realized but Kate Hudson, whose character Penny Lane insists she is the rock group's muse not its groupie, takes her role to greater depths without eating the scenery. She deserved the Oscar nomination.  Ultimately, the film is a bit gentle--it does not amend or revise our cultural insight into the era and environment it portrays; it is not a take-no-prisoners satire; it does not bleed--and that's why I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 5.  It does deserve a 5 for what it is not--not another gross-out comedy, not a violent movie, not unwise, not a badly made movie of which we are seeing way too much these days.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|What can i say about this album? In my opinion this is their best ever! Brave New World finds Maiden with a sorta progressive metal sound. Bruce Dickinson &amp; Adrian Smith's return to the Irons has rejuvenated the band and have once again proved themselves to be the Kings of Metal! This album has not 1 filler in it. Some of the great songs from this album include: &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot;, &quot;Out Of The Silent Planet&quot;, &quot;Ghost Of The Navigator&quot;, &quot;Dream Of Mirrors&quot; &amp; their first single off of the album, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;
B00005J73X|4.0|This album is not like some other live albums from other bands.  You can still hear all of the music, and the One Wild Night Remix is fun.  The songs on this album have captured all of the excitement of a Bon Jovi concert, and is the next best thing to actually being there.  I would recommend this to the fans who have a lot of their records since the songs on here  come from so many different albums.  If you're not a huge fan, I would recommend checking out some of their other CD's like Slippery When Wet, New Jersey, and Keep the Faith.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|i bought this cd because i liked 'waiting for tonight' and 'if you had my love' - but it turned out those 2 were the only good songs! i felt the rest were missing something - and there was no punch to it. she has a lot of slow songs, and it's fit for background noise - you hear something, but don't know what she's singing about because she's whining. i was disappointed overall.
B000059Z8J|5.0|What a great DVD! I've been waiting for SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE to come out on DVD for quite some time and this DVD was worth the wait. If you loved this film then in 1978, you'll absolutely love this DVD edition. It has all the magic you remember and more!<br />The film itself has been brilliantly restored for the DVD. SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE has never looked better. I did have to turn the volume up a little on my TV set to hear everything, but that is the single flaw in this DVD release. All of the memorable scenes are hear better than ever. The destruction of Krypton,Jon and Martha Kent finding Kal-El for the first time, the Fortress of Solitude, Superman appearing to the public for the first time to rescue Lois Lane from a helicopter, and the list goes on. There are some scenes added to this version also. I think just about any additional scenes to SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE just make it better and even more enjoyable.<br />Even the DVD extras are quite good. There are some movie trailers and the famous teaser are here also. I enjoyed the three documentaries. They were made recently for this DVD edition of SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE and there are interviews with almost all of the principles involved, including Christopher Reeve. Plus, there are some cuts of John Williams famous music score included as well. <br />In case you were wondering, I really liked this DVD. It had been a long time since I saw SUPERMAN, and it still holds up today. When I was younger, I believed a man could fly, and I don't see why anyone else wouldn't believe a man could fly, even today.
0440133688|4.0|This appears to be an elaborated autobiography of the author's internship experiences and a rationalization of his 'abandonment' of medicine for psychiatry.<br />There is much hilarious insight into 70's hospital life, with some fanciful sexism thrown in, presumably to keep things interesting, but which may have the opposite effect these days.<br />My one disappointment in the book is that the second half of the book rings quite false to me.  I can understand the validity of the author's attraction for psychiatry, as a means to exploit his training without having to actually touch patients, but his portrayal of it as actually being more curative than medicine is quite a stretch, and sounds like quite the rationalization.<br />The portrayal of the hyper analytic Freudian girlfriend as the means to his recovery of Shem's humanity, strikes me as an over the top rationalization of his resignation to their marriage.  She does not sound at all human in his characterization, and makes me wonder about the real-life counterpart to this character.<br />The one anecdote in the book that sounded to me like a true account of psychological healing was the mime show of Marcel Marceau.  If this book is ever made into a movie, this would make a wonderfully touching scene.  I have to believe it is based on an actual experience of the author's.<br />I noticed that some readers here seem to have been annoyed by the recurrent Irish cop characters, but I found them quite enjoyable figures, sort of Shakespearean characters who function as the observers of the story.<br />Overall, a fun read, and a valuable account of the reality of an important profession, occasionally marred by superfluous scenes. Given that, it's reputation as on a par with Catch-22 is quite deserved, in my opinion.<br />Laughter *is* the best medicine!
B00003CXP0|5.0|This has to be one of the most disturbing films that I have ever seen. I just got the video the other day, and let me tell you, it had a strong impact on me. I wasn't really expecting that kind of a &quot;wham-bang&quot; ending! The performances are spectacular, and ELLEN BURSTYN DESERVED THAT OSCAR! No offense to Julia Roberts, but Ellen's performance was the most powerful for the year 2000. I agree with the rest of the reviewers: This film should be shown all around high schools everywhere. It is a graphic, disturbing account of the effects of drugs on four different people and how it sent their hopes and dreams down the toilet. The end will leave you shocked. You will not be able to get this film out of your head for a few days. Believe me.
B00005A0RI|5.0|This has yet (after lo, these many weeks) to find its way into the diaspora of seldom listened to CD's that make up my vast jazz collection, which is probably some kind of record (ha ha) for a new release. It's a good thing jazz musicians aren't politicians, because I generally love Charlie Haden's music while detesting his politics. Whereas Paquito D'Rivera, the expatriate Cuban altoist, has admirable politics, but his music isn't (usually) as interesting to me. Go figure. <br />There's a slow burn happening here that just doesn't quit.  Sultry, get-under-your-skin balladry combines with probably Gonzalo Rubalcaba's best playing on disk and some perfect guest spots by Joe Lovano and others to make perfect summer-on-your-deck, sipping-San-Miguel-Dark listening.
B00005B4GD|5.0|This is where I came in is a primo cd.  I haven't listened to the Bee Gees in about 20 years. After catching A&amp;E's One Night Only, I ordered this CD.  This is one of the best CD's I own.  It has quickly become one of my favorites.  My kids like it too.  The Bee Gees' music is ageless.  Everyone remembers them and kids are experiencing quality music and song writing at a time when most groups are re-recording anything they can pay copyrights for.  They are an amazing group and this CD is incredible.  The Wedding Day song makes me want to get married all over again just to have it played at my wedding.  It's a shame that the Bee Gees aren't more popular in the US market.  The States are missing out on one of musics classic groups.
B00004SU5J|4.0|I'm not particularly literate on the subject of house jazz, acid jazz, or any other jazz but when I asked a trusted soul to recommend some music that was able to meet a variety of demands, he came up with &quot;Tourist&quot;. The demands: The cd must be able to be played straight through, with no skipping around. The cd must be able to be played continuously for multiple days on end. The cd must be able to be used interchangeably both as background music capable of inspiring extreme but lucid fits of working creativity AND as foreground music capable of inspiring relaxation, excitement, calmness, sleep and/or dancing, depending on one's mood. Finally, the CD must be smart, sassy, serious, silly and sexy at the same time.  &quot;Tourist&quot; meets these demands. Very satisfying.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Wow.  Finally we are presented with the DVD version of this fantastic movie.  I was beginning to lose faith in the system... But it's not all good since even after all this time the people who are putting out this epic on DVD have failed by making the 5.1 version in English and the Stereo in Japanese which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever to me! The first thing that comes to mind is: ARE THEY MENTAL? Of course I'll still buy it. I've been waiting for this for an excrutiatingly long time and a minor mistake (yeah right, who am I kidding) like this isn't going to detter me.  Still I am very disappointed.   Obviously the movie itself is of such enormous awesomeness I can't even describe it (esp. any better than the previous reviewers who did an excellent job).  All I can say is please buy this movie if you buy one movie in your entire existance and watch it many many times.  You will not regret it.  Definetely a tremendous landmark in the history of all animation and still the single best animation movie of all time (yes i do enjoy some of the older Disney movies but there is just no comparison).  If you have this movie and need a good anime fix, please also acquire Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke, Grave of the Fireflies, and Ninja Scroll (these are in order from best to not so best since all are amazing and of course this is only my opinion but I'm sure you'll agree after watching each one).
B00000J7S8|5.0|It would be redundant, I am sure, to tell you about Diana Krall's superb musical talent and luxurious vocals. The reason that you are looking up her album is almost certainly because you have heard about her sultry, smokey sound, her honeyed vocals and flawless piano playing, or you are already a fan and know these things to be true. I would, however, like to comment on why, peppered among the five-star reviews of this CD, there are so many two-star reviews calling it (and her) overrated, and a sacrifice to the demon god of popularity--not only by neophytes but also by true jazz and even true Krall fans. Krall rose to fame, took the jazz scene by storm in fact, on All For You and Love Scenes. This CD is in some ways a departure from those two, largely because some of the songs are backed by orchestration rather than Krall's usual trio, and also because there are fewer lapses into instrumentation than you find in the earlier CDs. The result is a &quot;bigger&quot; sound, a less intimate mood. But the departure is hardly radical, nor is the talent any less stunning. If the sound is &quot;too mainstream&quot; to you, I envy you the world you are living in.<br />This CD is delightful. I suggest you sample the humorous &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot;, or the snappy &quot;Devil May Care&quot;. Then buy it and revel in the full-out sexy &quot;Do It Again&quot; or soulful &quot;Why Should I Care&quot;. Brittney Spears is overrated. This CD is great.
B00005A1PR|4.0|India Arie has a very pleasant and strong voice.  Her music is soulful and very smooth. Her sound reminds me of a warm summer night with just a hint of a cool breeze &amp; a cold beverage in hand-ACOUSTIC SOUL takes one to a place where inspiration can  thrive and one can just CHILL!
B00005BL2A|5.0|It's completely beyond me why this album hasn't been getting the treatment it deserves. ....It seems some people can't handle the beauty, maturity, and technique involved in Exciter. This album should definately be listened to as a whole. One thing that I threw props to the Mode for was the fact that there are so many different types of songs from start to finish. Another unique feature is that the percussion throughout is so delicate that it's empowering. Just listen to it in \\"When the Body Speaks\\", \\"I Am You\\", and \\"Freelove\\". There's a song here for every mood, and Gahan's vocals have improved a thousand-fold since Ultra. Pick up Exciter. Relax. Treat yourself to an experience the likes of which no other artist has, or can present. Immerse yourself in the rich, welcoming beauty and the refreshingly different style.  .... and then listen to Dreaming of Me. ( sorry, I couldn't help it.)
B00005J73X|1.0|I'm sure there are a lot of Jovi fans already seething at the fact that I gave 'One Wild Night' a one-star review. Rest assured, as a big fan of many years myself none of you can be as annoyed as me after hearing this album... Put simply, this album features two songs by a young, hungry (not to mention superb) band in 1985, and thirteen others by rich men topping up the coffers after a five year hiatus. There is precious little here the fans won't already own on b-sides and the like, and the bad news is that it sounds NO BETTER. The band sound dull and lifeless, although extra attention reveals that the playing is, as ever, flawless. Sambora is a monster both on guitar and vocals, but Bon Jovi's voice is the lazy, emotionless whine it's always been live.  So, any more gripes? 'Fraid so. 1985-2001? Great, a set spanning their whole career, including recordings from all the big tours (New Jersey, Keep the Faith, etc...)? Actually, no. With the exeption of the aforementioned '85 tracks the whole album is taken from the 'These Days' and 'Crush' tours. And as a final touch, I should mention that they don't even attempt a feeling of continuity, with most tracks fading in and out. I'm sorry if I seem riled, but as a document to a frequently excellent live band, this is pants. The fans deserve a lot better, but it'll still shift by the truckload.
B00000BKDW|5.0|Powerslave is my favorite Maiden album, and one of the best Metal or Hard Rock albums of all time.  This album has some of the most amazing bass of any album in any genra.  The only 2 bass players that I can think of that are even in the same legue are the bass player/singer from Primus and the late Cliff Burton from Metallice (albums up thru Master of Puppets).  No hard rock or metal collection can really be considered complete without this seminal album.
0553278398|3.0|I didn't know that there was something like 'foundation series' when I first picked up a copy of foundation and empire. Later I decided to start from the first book of the series and was disappointed when I read this book. The story in this book is almost the same as in f &amp; e. The characters are very similar, the story is very similar and even the ending is almost the same. The author shows how powerful his imagination is in the setting and there are some pretty good action 'scenes' but the story was not compelling at all when you recognize the pattern and know the end from the start. If you plan to read the whole series, I would recommend to read this book last, if ever. It will spoil your fun when you read f &amp; e, which is much better.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Int. evening - A dimly lit room.<br />George: The movie must have a child-friendly comic relief, and we also need some clever doll to sell afterwards... hmmmmm... Jar Jar Binks!<br />George: Wait it can't be too child-friendly or we'll loose the fans! Throw Maul into the ring, oooooh he's scary... hmmmm... we'll cut his dialogue down to three lines so the action figure can contain them all!<br />George: Liam Neeson is starting to complain about his lame character and dialogue... hmmmm... let's just give him a noble death at the end of the movie... wait we've already done that.. aaah what the hell! Everybody loves a cliché!<br />George: Wait! The script is a little thin... hmmmmmmm... Wait I own this cool Special FX company they'll fill out the holes!<br />George: All the cool authors have expanded my universe making it diverse and colorful... but let's just focus on places we know... like Tatooine!<br />George: Anakin is really smart... we'll let him build C-3PO... wait why doesn't Vader recognize him later? Oh yes... he's just been ignoring him... heh heh...<br />George: Oh yeah I've also invented these midiclorieans... which they for some weird reason haven't heard about in the original episodes... well the knowledge has just been lost in the huge Jedi massacres later on!<br />*George continues like this for months*<br />Actually I'm a Star Wars fan... and I like Episode I because of the cool action scenes, spectacular special FX and I actually don't think that the acting is so bad, and Jar Jar is pretty funny at times. I just have this love/hate thing for this episode. The whole Star Wars spirit, the innovation behind the old trilogy has been replaced by some kind of Disney oriented commercial family pack! To much money (minus 1 star)too little creativity (minus 1 star)... and George you better clone Darth Maul in Episode II and make it bloody and horrible for Anakin, and realease the original episodes on DVD (and not make 6000 special editions), or I'll cut offthat beard of yours while you sleep! (can you get sued for this?)
0060392886|5.0|WHAT AN AWESOME READ!  I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, AND FINISHED IT IN ABOUT 4.5 HOURS FLAT!!!  I LAUGHED SO HARD AT SOME OF NIKKI'S EARLY ANTICS...TO THINK...NIKKI SIXX A NERD---NO WAY!!! HE'S STILL MY ROCK AND ROLL HERO AND SEXY WITH IT!  LONG LIVE ROCK!
0380796090|2.0|This book had so much potential because the story is interesting and the characters endear themselves to you. Keyes, the author, ruins her book in the following way. She has this irritating tendency to explain her punch lines as though her audience consists of thick skulled neanderthals. Also, I found her rambling on style to be tedious. The heroine over-reacts to everything and mulls over and over-analyzes everything to the point of nausea.
0385501560|4.0|Having read all of Chuck Palahniuk's other books I eagerly anticipated Choke. After getting the book I sat down and over the course of only a couple of nights I breezed right through it. Chuck's text flows so well, and the story is so engaging, it's really hard to put the book down. But in a quick read it's so easy to miss what makes Choke so great. The gems of this book lie in the nooks and crannies of the story. The main thread of the book is a wonderfully twisted story of a guy (Victor) who fakes choking at restaurants so people can save him and then eventually help him pay for his mother's care. But what you'll catch the second time around are these amazing moments - everything from a how-to guide for the mile high club, to scenes with Victor in his mom's retirement home taking the blame for senile patients' long unresolved conflicts. Every Chuck Palahniuk book has something new and refreshing to offer and Choke follows that thread well. I definitely recommend Choke, and as with many of Palahnuik's books, you've got to read it at least twice!
B0000029LG|4.0|This is Michael Jackson's greatest hits album and it's a double CD.  The first CD is absolutely breath-taking with such classics as Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, Rock With You, She's Out of my Life, Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller, Man in the Mirror, and I Just Can't Stop Loving You.  Although I felt that he should have put on this disc Off the Wall, Human Nature, and Dirty Diana, all in all a smoking first disc.  Then, unfortunately, comes the second disc.<br />The problem with the second disc is that there are only a handful songs on here that are worth listening to over and over.  Those tracks are Scream (with sister, Janet), They Don't Care About Us, Stranger in Moscow, Childhood, and of course, the great R Kelly song, You Are Not Alone, which became the first song in Billboard's history to debut at #1 on the Hot 100 singles chart.  (However, that's the only #1 on this new disc.)  MJ sounds like a bitter old man on many of these songs and hey I know he was upset about that... molestation charge, but was a whole song in which he repeats initials necessary?  (For the record, he had to change the real DA's initials to the fictious, &quot;D.S.&quot;)  I'm sorry but I still haven't seen anything consistently good from him since Bad.  I know he can do it because he's done it before, but when is he going to figure this out?
0066620694|5.0|Here's a book that comes right out and states that even the best-managed companies, with all their investment in the latest technologies and attention to customer care, are susceptible to failure. It doesn't matter what the industry, be it high technology or retailing, this susceptibility exists.<br />Author Christensen's book presents a set of rules that defy convention on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation, using the real-world lessons of successes and failures of leading companies today. The innovator's dilemma is this: when does one apply the rules of disruptive innovation that goes so much head-to-head against the conventional wisdom?<br />The author offers some good examples of disruptive technologies that helped to redefine the competitive landscape of their respective markets. He shows clearly that these products did not come about as the result of successful companies carrying out solid business practices in established markets. The case is made where these and other products cut into the bottom of the marketplace and evolved to displace competitors at the top end of their field, and displace their dominant technologies as well.<br />Provocative and cogent, this is one of the most talked about business books of our time, and is one that belongs on every project manager's briefcase.
B0000026WD|4.0|I would like to give this album 3 1/2 stars, but Amazon doesn't let you, so I'll be kind and round up to 4 stars.  This album comes nowhere close to what he did with Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad.  Anybody who tells you any differently is more messed-up than MJ himself.  The only #1 from the album, Black Or White, would be a good song if he got rid of that cheesy beginning.  That has to be one of the dumbest things that I had ever heard on a song!  In the Closet and Remember the Time are okay but are lucky that they got as high as they did on the Hot 100 singles chart.  Jam, Keep the Faith, and Heal the World as well as Will You Be There are all better songs and the album's main highlights.  This album would be a great album for any other artist, but we all know what this artist is capable of and he's definitely capable of better things than this.
B00005B36H|3.0|One of the best parts of this cd is the 20 second gut-wrenching, angst-ridden shriek near the end of &quot;the Grudge&quot;.  This is the Maynard I like to hear, and this part of his personality is generally taking a smoke break for the album's remainder (besides in ticks and leeches).  If this is the best Tool ever, then why am I (shamefully admitting) reminiscing to the Kinks and the Doors?  Wait..don't answer that.
B00000099Y|5.0|There's little that I can say that the somewhat 500 reviewers haven't said already.  One thing is that when an album gets that many reviews, you know it's a special album.  I would like to say that I'm not your normal hard rock fan.  I have albums by bands like Blink 182, the Goo Goo Dolls, techno stuff like Moby, Fatboy Slim, and the Chemical Brothers, and even stuff by Celine Dion and the Bee Gees.  However, this is great music--plain and simple.  Adam Jones may be the best guitar player that I have ever heard and Maynard James Keenan is not a great singer but he is an unforgettable one.  The bass player and drummer are also excellent.  My favorite tracks are Eulogy, the title track (which is spelled differently than what is on the side of the CD), and of course, Stinkfist, for which some bizarre reason, MTV retitled Track #1 (it had a very scary video, to say the least).  I didn't care for the interludes and some of the songs tended to go on a little too long.  However, these are just minor things and even the tracks that I did not name specifically are still good.  This really is an album that gets better and better after each listen.  If you don't have this album, you owe to it yourself to buy an album that many have hailed as one of the best of the '90's.
6301095294|4.0|When I first saw this film I simply couldn't understand why so many people ganged up to trash it. I've seen it two more times since then with friends and my opinion has only strengthened.<br />To me this is a far more interesting film than overrated boomer nostalgia like a &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; because it gives a better look into their personalities--this is their film, and the truest test of just how much you're on the Beatles' wavelength, which means a liking for Goon-show type humor and pop surrealism. Therefore people who expect every movie to have a &quot;point&quot; or nice understandable plot should go back to kino-kindergarden and skip the film. (The sort of people who beat words like &quot;self-indulgent&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; into the ground to describe what isn't instantly understandable) MMT is basically a set of music videos loosely held together by the various goings-on during a Ken Kesey-esque coach trip. And at 55 minutes it's too short to be boring anyway. The entire point is to sit back and not bother--to quote Bob Dylan--shoveling each dream into the ditch of what each one means.<br />The film of course has large flaws. There are quite a few comic situations, but the Beatles don't really develop them.(John and George are more out of it than Ringo and Paul too.) Some of the lightly sketched sequences do drag a bit as a result.But the movie's strength lies in its resolute silliness--like an overlush, parodic seaside &quot;love affair&quot;, John dressed up as an Italian waiter endlessly shoveling mud-like spaghetti for a obese woman, or the Beatles capering around in wizard's outfits like kids who've eaten too much sugar. That silliness shades into genuine pop surrealism with the primitive, excellent videos for &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Blue Jay Way,&quot; featuring the most captivating use of superimposition, odd props in even odder locations, children, extreme lighting, and fleet-footed but purposeful intercutting.(McCartney made for an occasionally clumsy but effective director) They live up to the mood of the songs--they seem genuinely dream-like and make a good match with the Beatles' captivating videos for &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane.&quot; Those videos, especially the former, freaked parents out in their day, and an extended music video like &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; still manages to irritate people to this day. (Especially all those poor souls who begin by saying &quot;I'm a huge Beatles fan but...&quot;)
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem was one of the main artists of 2000. The Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.7 million copies it's first week. That was second best in 2000. This cd/cassete contains his hit singles The Real Slim Shady, The Way I Am, and Stan featuring Dido. If you are a hip hop/rap fan this is a must buy. The Real Slim Shady is a great party song.
B00005B36H|5.0|You know, Tool always seems to have this mysical image thing about them - the almost humerously overdone packaging on this album especially reflects it.  I don't know if I buy into all that, but underneath the fluff are some very, very talented musicians.  The complexity of what they do is even more so impressive for being so liquid and subtle. <br />Though this album has a sound all its own, different from their previous releases, it is still unmistakably Tool.
B000001FKY|5.0|I have been a huge Def Leppard fan ever since I got this album back in 1988. I remember hearing some of the songs on the radio before I got the album, and I finally got it with my 7th grade lunch money that I had been saving for awhile. It was the cassette, and I listened to it so many times that I wore it out! I purchased the CD a few years later, and I still have the same CD in my collection. This is without a doubt one of the greatest albums I've ever listened to. It contains an unheard-of 6 top-10 singles: &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Love Bites&quot;, &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, &quot;Armageddon It&quot;, and the title cut &quot;Hysteria&quot;. The other 6 songs, &quot;Women&quot;, &quot;Run Riot&quot;, &quot;Love And Affection&quot;, &quot;Gods Of War&quot;, &quot;Excitable&quot;, and &quot;Don't Shoot Shotgun&quot; are all great. This album is a great mix of slow and fast melodic rock songs. Pure, polished, musicianship is what you'll hear in this collection, the finest of the finest. This album is also the last recordings by the late-great guitar player Steve Clark. If you are a true Def Leppard fan, you probably already own this masterpiece. If you are a new Def Leppard fan, then I strongly suggest that you get this one! This album has sold over 10 million copies at least, and there is a reason why: Great, timeless music. This is a classic album that I never get tired of listening to. If you don't have it, pick it up and ROCK ON!!
