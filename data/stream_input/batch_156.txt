B008WNSCHA|5|This product is another home-run for Amazon. It is made from light weight material but it is strong and the product has nice adjustments that allows the table to fit the back of the seat very nicely.
B0052SF0LO|5|I have 3 of these white led light but happy with so far good price
B000CO76EW|5|Amazon does not list this as fitting a 2002 Explorer 4.0L 6-cylinder but it does. I verified it on the manufacturer's web site. It has two different styles of hold-down screws to choose from.
B00EDWF1BE|4|Easy to install. But the metal hit the painted fender so you have to be careful when you unlatch the hood.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works great with note 4
B0017OFXAA|5|Not much to say other than they work just fine. A repair shop put by mistake a 100W blue bulb in the car around a year ago and I replaced them with the Nighthawks. They seem to be giving the same level of brightness as the old ones I replaced with less wattage. That is excellent. They don't do anything spectacular however..neither do they appear to be manufactured with outer space technology and look pretty much like a well made conventional bulb. Let's see how long the will last..I guess I am not sure , if this justifies the price..but if they will last at least 3 years I would say the price is ok.<br /><br />Has beed 2 year in cold CO weather..upgraded to 5 star..
B00ENALR14|3|no complain works good
B00KMSGZAO|5|Worked.perfectly
B000GZJ2W6|5|This is a great tire repair kit and highly recommend to any motorcycle rider and even for a car. The small size is ideal for the limited cargo space on a motorcycle. Two thumbs up!
B005W9K1L2|5|Bought 2 of these for the wife and I and we love them. Set your own number and away you go. Easy to carry. Easy ti use. Shop around cause I got a 2 pack for a great price.
B000DT7SX0|1|Im giving barely any stars becuz u guys said it fit my 92 dodge dakota when it does not fit. And isnt right in any which way
B00DNU3MIG|5|FINE
B00M8C5R92|4|Great units very heavy duty.
B000BYB20M|5|They made a huge differance in performance for my 99' Ranger 4 cyl. The blue looks great on the engine, and they should hold up well as they seem to be of real good quality. Also, I used Bosch platinum iridium spark plugs, together they make a great combination. I highly recommend them.
B0053ZIWD4|5|Very sporty look.
B0038BBIXQ|5|I damaged one of my tail light so I needed a replacement.  It came with all the bulbs & wiring harness so it was simple to install plug & play.  Perfect fit no need to do any alteration.  I chose this b/c the lens were clear not smoke colored which would cause an issue for passing our safety check requirements in Hawaii.
B00EKT217C|1|Be careful - this is wide - it didn't fit a Malibu, Honda or Audi - all mid sized cars.  The rubber pads on the top edges that are there so your jacket has something to grip slid off in a week and left a sticky mess.  I'm returning mine
B000F5HU5S|5|A+++++
B000CMFT7U|5|Heavy duty product perfect fit
B004OH8XEK|5|EDIT: I originally thought the fitting on main hose leaked out of the box. When I got a replacement and found it leaking at the exact same fitting, I decided that had to be more than coincidence. I discovered that the female end I was trying to mate with was incompatible, and the new actuator had actually come with an adapter that *looked* like just a plug. Using that adapter I had no problems, and likely the original was not broken.
B0095PU36M|5|Amazing divider if you are not thinking to remove rail dock system.
B005N9IEPG|3|printing was slightly off center when we got them. Color not as vibrant as photo. So, a little disappointed in this purchase. Will probably go with USMC licensed after this. Lesson learned.
B00BF2X94G|5|Awesome! Nice and Bright!
B00GNENXQ0|5|I had the chance to use my rope this past weekend. My friend was stuck in a snowbank from plowing and we attached the rope to both of both of our bumpers. The tug was smooth and not jerky. With two swift pulls he was out.
B00MN92QI0|5|Very nice
B000C19DGY|5|Easy to install  and works really good. I had one on my old truck also. A must have for tailgates
B000FCH1Y6|5|2014 FJ Cruiser.  Fits perfect and significantly reduces interior heat build up.  Especially when parked in a southerly direction
B000EDSSMA|5|Perfect fit easy to install
B000C122SA|1|The item was delivered as promised but it was damaged.  The driver's side fan was unbalanced which will probably create undue wear causing it to wear out faster. Since it is a plastic fan blade, nothing can be done.  In order to replace it, I would have to order a new one and pay first, then ship back the damaged one, and then be credited.  This was a lot of hours assembling and disassembling my vehicle. Not happy with the fan I received :(
B0041MVALG|5|Perfect for  travel. .  So glad  we bought it!  Takes about an hour  to assemble, very light weight  even  a lady can pick it up.  Would  highly recommend it!
B000C8ZGPE|4|Fit my 96 grand caravan, made it quiet
B001BQTPFI|4|I like it - had to cut the bedliner - other than that it's a cool box that swings out to make access easier.  I will buy another for the passenger side.  Boxes are not huge inside.
B0018ICAMO|5|These work great on my Raider truck topper.  Matched them by part number, and they function just as they should.
B00078BQ62|5|Like the other reviews say it really is an easy add on to your propane only hot water heater. Took me under an hour they make it very easy to do that you really cant mess it up. The Anode around. The rod makes it a great add on item without changing the anode design  which Suburban says you need in tank for corrosion purposes. I turned it on and when I came back a few hours later the water was hot, to hot to keep my hand under just the hot water so it works great.<br />  I myself went to Home Depot and bought a 8.00 switch called a pilot switch. Its simply a light switch with a red light that comes on when you switch the power on. Its not hard to do and Lightning Rodd sells their own version of the same thing for 35.00 on amazon too. You don't need this extra switch to make it work you can just find a way to plug it in someplace in RV and just remember to unplug it before you drain it. I just like knowing when things are on and the red light tells me that. I would say you have to be handy and comfortable with routing electric lines and cutting in a receptacle in your RV if your going to do the switch. I guess that why the Kit itself is really kept a simple as can be. Go for it, it will pay for it self over a long summer.<br /><br /> UPDATE NOV......... 2014......AFTER USING IT FOR ENTIRE SUMMER IT HELD UP AND WORKED AS ADVERTISED. AFTER READING OF THE OTHER ITEMS ON THE MARKET LIKE THE LIGHTNING ROD I FELT ITS THE BEST AFTERMARKET SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND HAS ANODE ON ROD WHICH PREVENTS BUILDUP.
B00029WR78|5|Good stuff
B00CB8WM2S|4|As advertised
B000BYGD4W|5|Looks identical to the factory coil in shape and size. My engine fired up right away with this one. Unlike that so called OEM coil I bought before this one. Recommend this. I am buying another to carry around with me. Never can be too safe with these one coil engines.
B007WWU79S|5|Fits great. Does the job. Did not cost a arm and a leg. I bought 2 rolls and did my large toolbox. Easy to cut and fit. Only had to cut the length. The other width did not really need cutting with exception of a small trim here and there. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to protect their toolbox or can be used for other drawer lining needs.
B000FEW98W|3|I love the bumper sticker, but it is not surviving well on my bumper - after about 6 months on the car I could see wear and now at over a year I can see I will need to replace it soon.  Not as long lasting as most bumper stickers.
B00G3RWJHG|1|Awful
B000IDYKQO|5|Extremely easy to use and durable.
B0027ETAHQ|5|Fits well, has worked so far.
B00J7RB72M|5|Great for storing many CDs and DVDs, convenient carrying handle, sturdy materials.
B000M8NXEA|5|This I the only windshield cleaner I buy now. I actually like it more than Safelite brand. No steaking, just nice easy clean shine on my mirrors and glass. Love this product.
B00FZ5ICFU|1|Save your $ on these. These are adorable in the picture and in the package. The first car wash you go through all you have is a pink valve stem cover. The zebra stripes are merely stickers that move around and do not stay in place. Very cute idea, but need to use a better glue to ensure the print will stay on them.
B005C4FJDW|5|I wear them all the time while driving. They help the arthritis in my hands. I do not have to grip the steering wheel so tightly.<br /><br />Thanks
B009T4OFH2|1|Replaced correctly for my 2008 4Runner, but it does not have a full clean swipe, only partial.
B00112PLUU|5|I've been buying these at the auto supply store ever since they came out. I originally got them for use in the garage for cleaning grease off my tools, hands and other things. They are also the best thing you'll ever find for cleaning car wax off the trim on your car after a hand wax job.    One day, while I was cleaning my kitchen and getting disgusted by the sticky, greasy film that seems to form on the cabinet doors, appliances and, well, just about everything, I decided to go out to the garage and grab my Armor All Orange Cleaning Wipes. They worked great! They cut through grease like no kitchen cleaning product in my arsenal. Now I probably use four or five canisters in the kitchen for every one I go through in the garage.
B00FEQ0CCQ|3|It's a neat little doohickey for those of us without tunes, and tired of earbuds. For the price, it does everything it should do, although I've been scratching my head about what the little keychain fob is for. It would be helpful if a users manual, or at least a website, were available to teach all that the unit does. But again, for less than 50$, I can't complain.
B004EPSPZY|4|helmet feels like it fits up top, but there is so much gap at the bottom, I get a lot of wind noise in my ears.  There is no cheek pad.  Bought some replacement cheek pads for another brand helmet and hope to retrofit them in this helmet.<br />on the up side, I love how it looks.  Nothing flashy, and it can be customized how I want.
B000WO2XP4|1|I got the wrong part even though I followed the ordering instructions.  I blame the reseller, not Sachs.  It wasn't worth the money to try to ship it back for refund.  I went to my local brick and mason store and got the correct part which worked just fine.
B008UYCN76|5|Fits real good
B0055T53CG|4|A little tough to sew on and gloves are an absolute must.  Wrap a band aid or some first aid tape around the joints of your fingers that you use to hold the thread tight and that will insure you don't get blisters through the gloves.  You have to pull it tight to get the seams together.  Pulling it tight caused the holes in the back side to tear a little.  I'm not sure if I was missing the hole as I sewed through the back, or if I was just pulling the tension in the wrong direction.  The holes in the front are perfect, so I was doing something wrong.  Since it only affected the holes in the back, it does not detract from the appearance and the leather is reinforced, so there is no concern of the thread tearing out.  There was plenty of thread left.  I could easily have left 6 inches at the beginning, and still had over a foot at the end.
B000OUW7XE|5|Used on my 2012 ram 3500 to install leveling kit. Worked great. Couldn't lock on to the coil due to coil being too big but worked as needed and saved a lot of hassle of dropping the whole front end.
B00D7TD7VU|5|Fits nicely in hand.
B000GBS6UY|4|Great Helmet and very functional and practical.  Would purchase again.  Air vents on the front and side are really nice.
B000CE9ERO|5|I have seen other Chevys (mostly big trucks, and hey, I have &#34;size matters&#34; on my lil sport car: red). This is a true GM certified product, and it is very high quality. This merchant really knows the best merchandise to let us choose from. I am just wondering<br />where I would put these two, and if I would need more? I want to deck my car out in true style!!!
B000C9SJUC|5|I was tired of dropping my cap every time I got fuel.<br />this sucker fits just like the original and has a nice little strap to hold it to the door<br />awesome product
B0073MGSHW|4|i gave four stars for the fact that the nipple on the drivers side does not fit the factory female quick connect.
B00HY5W94E|5|THE  PUDDLE LIGHTS ARE AWESOME,CAME QUICK,A BIG HIT AT CRUISE NIGHTS,I PLAN ON BUYING MORE!!! EVERYONE WANTS THEM ,SO BEFORE LONG,EVERYONE WILL HAVE THEM.
B0000AYFTV|5|good deal
B000CHWBA8|5|My car was on blocks basically and I needed a $50 part from most stores and got it for a steal. I don't know if this guy needed flower money to get out of the dog house but I am gratefull, not only for the price but the serious business attitude not found that often anymore. I am in calif and these guys beat my dvd's from colo ordered at the same time. This is a top of the line product and I'm \\"ON THE ROAD AGAIN\\".....
B001THXG7C|5|Wow!! That is all I have to say about this product.  It works excellent.  I have used it during a car show and people will come up and ask what do I use to make the car shine so bright.  It works best when you spray and wipe then use another MF towel to buff.
B0031OVWXG|3|A little too wide. Had to trim it.
B001662WDA|5|The long and short is that if you ever take the springs off the truck for anything, make sure and put more grease back on bushings.  I forgot, and now they squeak. I'm going to have to take them off again in the spring to re-grease.
B000XQ9MGE|5|this stays in my car trunk. when I use it people say &#34;Wow! I did not know there was a portable battery charger that small!&#34; as they are trying to hand me their battery cables. ' course they haven't seen the Powerall yet. This is great but you don't need it cause they now have the Powerall unit out. You can carry the Powerall unit in your backpack or purse.
B000C9TASC|5|there's nothing really exciting to say about cabin air filters, except that their the most overlooked filter in your car. once you finally pull out the old filter, you'll be digusted by what's been in your cabins air floating around, and quickly be glad you changed the filter
B005MVXTCI|5|ok
B0012TRLWS|4|Does the job, only thing I don't like is the stitching right down the center of the mouth.
B000IYCZEM|4|I used it to cover up a bad paint job on my car... I worked great, but I am just hoping that the sun makes it tighter because it is a little baggy..... (however, many new cars are made of plastic and if it was too tight it my break something).....
B000GU5LSK|3|Looks great but I did not get the mounting hard ware so at this point it just looks good and I can not put it on my bike!? please send me the rest. the cover came in fast, with the parts missing looks like some one returned it and some one sent it to me.
B007AQ2M3U|4|Perfect fit. Put on my 2000 Chevrolet Suburban
B00KTJ9MQ0|5|i like it, because it is what it says it that is, A replacment keyless entry, was very easy to program with the instructions it came with and another plus is that it came with batteries already installed....got this for my 04 Nissan Titan
B00PRQBW1I|5|Adds a personal touch to my 4x4.
B007L2JNT4|5|These mirrors are very easy to put on and take off. They look like they came with the truck. The only thing is that I wish the right mirror was a little longer to see past the awning. Once you get used to them you will be glad you bought them.
B0024IABZA|5|It's the right part, and I can cut my grass again! The folks at Discount Starter and Alternator were GREAT! I got it earlier than expected too.
B000WJEY8S|5|Compact fits on custom bracket bought on ebay for the eu2000i generator, bolts up to the small air cleaner nuts but sits behind access panel safely where it wont be broken off or damaged. it was easy to install and well built. does the basic keeps track of hours run. will buy for the rest of my gas operated small equipment.
B000N4UQL6|4|i recently purchased my second unit after the battery would not hold a charge on my 1 yr old model. unfortunately the new one , received yesterday, does not work properly out of the box and it cannot be returned to Amazon. when the unit is working, there is no better but no product is any better than the customer service you get with it.  Amazon customer service has resolved my problem 100% and actually exceeded my expectations. i have modified this review on 07/14/2013 to reflect Amazon's problem resolution. i did order an identical replacement unit.
B000UVGK5I|5|Great fit to my car, keeps it cool. It does have to be rolled but I think that allows it to be thicker than if it had to be folded daily. The highlander is big, I just put it behind me unless someone is sitting there! Best sunshade I've ever seen and price is great!
B00QTIAPMU|5|Was just as described. Good value
B004WO1IHO|5|Red is not a red... Almost burgundy. But  nice shorts and will buy again.
B0080JTZA4|5|my girl loves it
B005M29YEY|5|Very good quality and really helped my mom in the front door.
B000BNMOKK|5|Excellent bargain and a good safety item for golf carting after dark. Need to also order battery tender female cigarette adaptor to attach to 12v battery.
B000C7WMVQ|5|good
B004XEQMLU|5|Great product!
B005LB6EVM|5|works perfect just as described lost the chargers for the original tiff machines i have and this works exactly as described
B002RCGVDO|5|best tool for bending lines in cramped places and it bends in a tight radius
B006R0XYGY|3|Put them in and saw they were not as bright as stock bulb. Pretty disappointed. Not sure if I will every use them.
B00DBEO6CK|5|This is what i expected  works great.
B001RKU1DI|4|Great product. Not sure what kind of GPS is supposed to fit in the top pocket. but the bag all in all works great.
B002OKVGSO|5|I got this for my 2012 Nissan Sentra and I really cannot tell the difference. The material looks the same. Even the skeletal frame ( can't think of another term), is similar. The last time I looked, this was being advertised at less than 2 pounds, which is clearly not. The mirror didn't have a fun-house effect, as is the case with other brands based on others' reviews. I was able to remedy my broken OEM but I'm gonna hold on to this replacement just in case the OEM gets side swiped again. Having said that, I wasn't able to attach the whole assembly so I cannot comment about the fit or if the electronics function correctly. I may have to go back on this posting in the future.
B005CLMQJ0|5|Working fine,fix good and good quality<br />Thanks
B0000UUX8O|4|I don't really like the way these fit, but the protection is great.
B00WFHXAW6|2|Got this and thought it was something that just pluged into the wasting harness but after getting it realized that you had to use theses wire clips that actually cut into the installation of the wire which I dislike because it causes problems later with your wiring and corrosion as well as weaking your wires.  So I wish they would of stated that in the description would of saved alot of time.
B00CYW93Z0|5|Perfect
B0041TP3GM|1|IT DOESNT FIT IN MY CAR ...WASTE OF MONEY
B004H1R5HE|5|The mats came in on time and look GREAT!<br /><br />I have hit them with a pressure washer and they held up fine! Great bang for the buck.
B00K3I4XSE|3|Plastic sign, not metal, otherwise 5 star
B009NOZ4RI|1|I purchased these based on Amazon.com's part finder for my 2000 Subaru Outback.  I had purchased these in the hope that they would be brighter and use less power.  They were dimmer than the OEM bulbs.
B0017R95DI|5|I ran this pump for two hours straight to vacuum my Ford Ranger A/C system. Did not skip a beat. Very good quality unit from what I can tell. I hope it gives me several years of use!<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned the fact that the pump -leaked- oil during shipment and the oil was on the inside of the plastic bag, and on the motor itself. Mine arrived the same way. It appears whoever is testing these units is not draining the oil, or not draining all of the oil before shipment. This may be a quality control issue, it may not.  What I did notice was the black screw-on caps that cover the suction inlet ( brass fittings ) were lose.Almost to the point where they may fall off. This is where the oil leaked from I believe, or the air exhaust port. I'm not sure which one.  The bottle of oil included was sealed.<br /><br />The seller of this item may want to take a closer look at this pump MFG and address the issue with them directly as they may have an issue in their factory.  I wiped off the pump and it works fine otherwise. I'm very happy with it. It's my first vac-pump.
B00BN45CIC|5|Ordered it on Friday, received Monday free regular shipping. It is smaller that I thought it would be, but I love it.
B000066OC7|1|This product is okay for the money it cost, however I suggest you invest the money and get a better support ... Wish I read the other reviews before I purchased this product ...
B00GURK2CS|1|The base aluminum neck is the same length as stock.  Add the rubber boot on and it is now about 2&#34; longer out than stock.  Will not fit with the swing arm on my scooter.  I think this might be for an ATV only.<br />Did not fit on my TaoTao Powermax 150cc.
B00OZ0YPXY|4|Very nice sound! Easy installation and good fit.
B000C1HJ5G|5|It was what I expected
B00EVMT6A8|5|Very &#34;original&#34; looking!
B0007LXTMS|5|Love this product, I'm a short lady and the sun visor in the cars are never enough to shield my eyes from the sun in the mornings and the late afternoons. Thanks for a great product. Ann in TN
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Love that this is one piece and not 2. Keeps my civic coooool.
B002YLR5GU|5|Permatex products are the best!
B0041TR892|5|Had it painted to match, awesome.
B002HXY7S4|5|Came in in expected amount of time. The shield looks great I will have to find another plastic washer one is missing and will also have to go buy some auto tape to install. Over all I'm happy with the look of the product on my 2013 xterra.
B006TGVPL2|5|These NFC tags work excellently, and I am especially fond of the keychain! Worth it for anyone into writing NFC tags for the first time, and the size is large enough for essentially any action(s) you could desire. Seem quite durable but will really be tested when I get back to college!
B00SLYXZAO|2|All four came off car on same tire...do not purchase for a Nissan Versa!
B00H39MX6U|2|I bought two of these and one arrived with a broken mounting bracket.  With such poor quality control, I cannot recommend these to anyone.  Look elsewhere.
B004H63IMA|4|I just had to buy 2 of these batteries for an APC UPS power supply. This is the second time I have replaced these batteries and the last set of Werker batteries lasted 3 years. I have used Werker batteries and had reasonable success with them and the price was 60% of buying the original replacement batteries.<br /><br />I did have one battery go bad after a little over a year so that is why I gave it only 4 stars. The warranty is for 1 year. (Same as the warranty on the original replacement batteries)<br /><br />They are good quality and lower in price for the equivalent performance. They are 12 VDC batteries rated at 12 AH. When you are changing them in a UPS, make sure that you remove any external battery jumper (If you have one on your UPS) for safety reasons. Also carefully remove and save your internal connection cables and make sure that the fuse in still ok that is located between the two batteries.<br /><br />They will not be fully charged when you get them so they will take at least 24 hours to reach peak performance. Based on the results I have seen in my personal experience these batteries are a good buy.
B00809XRZS|5|Easily replaced and a perfect fit -- what more can I say.  Great price compared to the local auto parts stores.
B00A82KXA2|5|Quick and easy
B000CB3QTO|5|Installed the bolts and went to the shop and got wheels aligned and camber set to 2.5 - Degrees,<br />perfect fit.....<br />can only recommend them,<br /><br />regards<br /><br />J. Tietze
B003IZBK4Y|4|Not too hard to install and makes the Ram look good. Toughest part was the steering extension, but that was more my fault for not doing it correctly.
B005644G7I|5|Arrived as planned and meet expectations.
B00ACEX16Y|5|Well I've had these installed almost 3 months, and I use them in conjunction with my LED turn signal lamps. They have worked flawlessly, but they are mounted inside my car rather than outside exposed to the elements. Where I live, the temperature gets rather hot, and so far so good.
B0061R3K4E|5|Love these. Very comfortable and look great.
B003FKW7OO|5|Still have it on my car!
B001G7CSS8|4|Decently made replacement cabin filter for the W140.  Its definately not as good as original, but it fits well and will assist in filtering better than the oft missed filter in these cars.
B007Y69EV4|5|The range is as good as the OEM unit, not worse.<br />Holding up really well.<br />Buttons do glow.<br />At the same I bought the Dorman replacement KeyFob Plastic.  it is not holding up nearly as well as this key fob is.
B0009H519Y|3|CAUTION this cleaner is NOT for painted wheels, most wheels today are painted or clear coat. This stuff was designed for metal wheels it says so right on can.
B000KYYM8M|5|I previously purchased one of these on Ebay, but I had to send it back because it didn't Program.  This one, however, was easy to program and it has worked perfectly ever since.
B003FKNAGS|5|Works great for working in my dusty backyard.  I recommend this product.
B009ANV81S|5|Delivered and worked as advertised. Nicely installed!
B001AEX4KI|4|OK, so this is actually a clever idea. We live in Colorado, and like to get up in the mountains topless. My husband bought this and threw it in the glovebox. We finally used it last weekend: a huge thunderstorm hit in the afternoon, and we were totally out in the open. It went from bright and sunny to cold and VERY wet in a hurry. We putt this top on, and we were able to drive all the way back to town, staying almost completely dry.<br /><br />The negative? It's NEVER going to get folded back up as neatly. We got wet and cold putting it on (not really the tops fault, but I'd want to be able to do this faster!).
B0085XV9JA|3|Not what I expected.  The can is much smaller, and it makes noise when bumping on the back of the seat.
B005MEZU18|5|got  for my son he loved it
B000E5S3BY|5|Took the Pilot out today and noticed an immediate change in how quite the engine is and the best part came when I realized that I averaged 22 MPG vice my normal 19 MPG on my 80 miles a day drive :D....I'll be saving 2340 miles a year $678 in gas.  I don't know if I did the math right but I know I'll be saving money at the end of the year.  This item pays for itself, highly recommended.
B000GV51PW|5|Fantastic clutch basket.  I have used Hinson in the past and this is also a quality part.  Box was perfect like it was off the shelf. I am in Canada and selected the two day guaranteed shipping and I received the past in about 25 hours. Awesome!
B001LNFZ4Q|4|NICE QUIET RUNNING ,THE STAND I WISH WAS ALL METAL BUT ITS PLASTIC   WITH METAL RODS HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER NOT FOR HEAVY DUTY USE .   I WISH IT CAME WITH SOME SMALL DRILLS HAD TO BUY MICRO DRILLS   1/8 INCH FROM HARBOR FREIGHT BUT WILL ACCEPT MOST IF NOT ALL    ROTARY TOOLS . I WOULD SAY IT WOULD LAST A WHILE BUT THERE THE   PLASTIC BASE MID FRAME AND TOP IF IT WERE METAL I WOULD GIVE IT FIVE STARS BUT FOR JUST TINKERING AROUND ITS OK ***
B003UANXCE|5|The thing is hard to figure out as the written explanations of all the lights and their combinations leave one scratching one's head. On the other hand, this thing will restore a battery left for dead, as it did for me. Incredible, especially when all I had to do was hook it up, plug it in, and wait 24 hours, explanations be damned. I use it to keep my John Deere mower battery and Harley battery in tip top condition. Most excellent.
B0072689O4|5|Item was as described and went into the car without any problems.
B00COWIVLM|4|Received 5W-30 by mistake other wise its as good as any other inexpensive synthetic. Just added to a vehicle, so i can't make any final conclusions till next oil change.
B00GR2WA12|5|Cool backing for application and keeps the bubbles away! Great seller n shipped & arrived as expected.
B001MOX5KK|4|got this switch fast installed in a minute, works great wish I would have ordered it a year ago. great deal
B000C5E3KQ|5|Fits like a glove. Much better than the bare metal pedal I had before.
B00ARJPKEA|5|Great, inexpensive product.
B000NCOKZQ|5|works good
B005HJ3EAC|4|The metal clip that holds this to the sun visor in the car fits on very tightly which is good because the whole purpose for us is to have something that will hold heavier sunglasses and not have it slip off (problem with the one this replaces).  The part that holds the sunglasses have two pieces of \\"soft-ish\\" rubber.  They hold the glasses very well.  At first I was afraid they might be too tight but the rubber gave way a bit.  So most glasses will fit okay but probably more designed for thinner ones.  The part of the clip that holds the top and bottom halves together works okay.  But I wouldn't be surprise if it gets worn out over time.  So far, so good.  It's doing its job well and seems to be pretty easy to use; not too hard to open, not too hard to close.
B006250QGU|5|Little small, but awesome product!
B001FAGKDU|1|Absolute garbage.  Light duty fabric, poor stitching, and lousy fitment.  Things started to pull apart as soon as I began installing them on a pair of stock 2005 Jeep TJ seats.  Within minutes a strap and a bungee had pulled loose.  Their stitching had unraveled.  First and last Rugged Ridge product I'll ever buy.
B000WPSOYM|5|The website stated that it would take a few weeks, but came in sooner, I think within a week. Like the bag, extends my storage tremendously!
B003CGBL5C|1|I ended up receiving two of these, one that I purchased and one that came as a replacement for the one that I purchased.  The first one had a bolt hole mis-aligned by approximately 1/4\\" on the drivers side rocker.  The U-cut on the passenger side rocker was cut too narrow and would not even fit around the post as per the instructions.  The replacement wasn't much better.  The driver's side rocker had two holes mis-aligned and the passenger side rocker was warped so that when seated in the rear holder the front side was mis-aligned by almost 6\\".  I would not recommend this product.  Please note that this part is manufactured in China and the quality control is representative of that.
B004FP378I|5|Came in the mail, looks exactly as pictured, seems like decent quality. Now just have to see how it wears on the bumper.
B000C9VUIK|3|Though it did fit correctly, it did not have any markings to prove it was a genuine GM part, and it did not come with replacement clips. The part I received also had a dent in it.  Since it was less than 1/2 the price at the dealership, I went ahead and installed it, and it seems to be working OK.
B003YT6I9Q|1|The bulb just cuts off something and the ballast say 35watts but its not or the bulbs are deep blue I order another kit from eBay the bulbs are deep blue and when they first come its like purple white then deep blue when full powered. This kit come on straight to some light blue and the bulbs flicker but one keep goin on and off time to time. Maybe if he drop his price I'd say get it and you can work wit by mixing or kits that you may have that is bad already. Basically use this kit for parts
B0002SRCMO|5|As Described
B002UD0GIG|2|I tried this product on several pairs of glasses -prescription and sunglasses. It did nothing to improve visibility or remove even the minor scratches.
B000C82274|5|good cavalier 2.2 1996
B005OZNJ9K|1|was not able to program key
B000FGECW6|5|Puchased to replace the one in our trailer.  Fit perfectly and works fine. Sure glad we didn't have to retrofit.
B0083EZ2NA|5|Works great
B00ERKGBU2|1|Is GREEN not YELLOW.. geez nothing can be simple can it..
B005JY7SMU|5|This is the most useful tool I think I have every purchased. Not only am I able to read the codes on all of my vehicles, but it gives me the most likely fixes for each code. I own foreign and domestic vehicles, and this tester works on all of them, including the ABS codes.
B00RSOLXFM|4|I have a big dog, and he has smelly dog syndrome.  If you are like me and have a pet with this ... you know how much it stinks.  Both figuratively AND literally! Well, the stink stops HERE! I admit I was a bit skeptical about this working.  Was this really going to take over the spot in the outlet where the &#34;cover the dog smell&#34; scented wall unit resides, and was it going to work? Guess what ladies and gentlemen: IT WORKS.  The aforementioned outlet is near my dog's kennel in our spare bedroom.  No more costly refills for this girl!! I like how simple this is to use - plug the base into an outlet, plug the ionizer in the base and away you go.  For those who aren't looking to use this in a room but prefer to use it in your car - no problem! The ionizer easily plugs into any cigarette lighter! It is so much better to have clean air than to mask it with a perfumed (car or wall) freshener. I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.
B009P8CM5E|1|Way to much money this is to much money these gloves are $3.99 they should not be selling these for 15 bucks that's crazy.
B000EQQXZQ|5|It was the perfect fit for my car and very good price and I get it on time,the quality great.
B001RB0SLW|4|The Size is correct, but the color is more of a pink than the bright purple-pink color shown in the picture
B004PHDWMM|4|Convenient and easy to store anywhere.
B008VIB7YG|3|Light and reasonably well-made. Don't expect these glasses to darken to the shades of most dedicated sunglasses. Even in the bright SW FL sun, these glasses darken only a modest amount. But, having them reduces the clutter in my windshield bag since I only have to carry these.
B007SQZV9E|5|What fun. Love this silhouette.  Easy to apply.  Wears well.
B001VXXUWK|5|I've only used it twice so far so its hard to speak of the long term durability of it, but what I can say is it seems to do its job well.<br /><br />I have a fairly large head and by that I mean freaking big, and there is no issue wrapping it around my mellon fully protection my face/eyes.
B00BCR417S|5|I am this product!  It is one of my boyfriends Father's Day gifts.  Got it really fast!  Thanks<br /><br />Thank YOU!
B003RAAOYM|5|Keyless Entry Remote - 5 Button, it's easy to program and all 5 button works fine. That's what I was looking.
B004HLZTHM|4|The tent was easy to set up. We loved camping while being able to us the back of our Pilot for extra sleeping and hanging out space! The string in one of the big tent poles broke while we were taking it down though. I'm on the phone with customer service now to hopefully get a replacement sent out.
B00803BD8W|1|Two of the hubcaps the clips snapped off while pushing it into the rim. One of them got two body cracks all of the way across the rim cover on each side of where the tab just snapped off when I pushed it into the rip. This is cheap breakable brittle plastic. It looks shiny and cheap until scratched or broken,  it has a shiny plastic luster and they look terrible. Do not buy these, they are not worth half of what Amazon is charging. Very crumby hub caps.
B008Z4BKSO|1|It was the wrong part
B00877SL2M|4|These bulbs look awesome and are easy to install. Might be a little 'cheap' but that's what you pay for... Only one of my bulbs didn't work right so no bug deal. I would recommend looking into the six pack for $1.29 though...same bulbs, less money.
B009ESL4HC|5|Perfect fit with no sticky tape to fail & fall off like the aftermarket lights. Quik & promt service. I would rate this product at 5 stars.
B00J3KXG68|5|Excellent gadget. Totally been very useful
B00BUMEIVE|5|Nice bag with a water proof bag. Lots of room and compartments. Fits snug no worry's that bag will move around.
B00CUN4PCO|4|I have a '97 Nissan pickup (D21).  Both cowl-grills broke this year so I needed to find replacements. I was happy to find them on Amazon.  These work but do not look as nice as the original OEM grills.  I'm uploading pictures so you can see the difference between OEM and what I received.  However, I'm still giving 4 stars because in the end they work well enough.  They also included extra &#34;clips&#34; in case you break or lose any during installation, which is a nice touch.
B003E1GLSM|4|Looks are a little sticky
B00651CLCS|5|We purchased two antennas for each of our Jeeps. They are super easy to install and are a perfect replacement for the taller, factory installed antenna.  Reception was not at all compromised by the shorter antenna.  We are very satisfied!  Thank you.
B00TAG8480|5|very helpful i little big put fit tank very durable and flexible....
B008Z3UI24|5|The product I received is of high quality, fits perfectly with my Hyundai Santa Fe, I received in the expected time, came without any damage, really did an excellent buy, so fully Good Holiday
B0058V9CF0|4|These mats are a great buy if you need something inexpensive and customizable. Bought them for my son's jeep and they've worked out well.
B0041TQS5M|5|This filter was super easy to install on my 2009 Honda Fit. The dealer wanted $63 for this part plus installation. I don't know why they charge so much when this requires no mechanical experience and five minutes to install. It required six total tabs to be cut; three on each side to fit flush. This was easily done with sharp scissors.
B002IVAC02|5|Just what I needed.
B00N9VIW8Y|5|great
B009Z6OBOG|1|I am not pleased with the light output or light color. The light from the bulb is purple and very dim. I would not recommend.
B0073MH4R0|5|First, this is not for regular removal. You should expect to put this on and leave it on. Only comes off when you no longer need it, it's destroyed, or you need to cleanup a spill that got underneath it.<br /><br />Fits beautifully, and seems to do a great job protecting the leather from the constant rub of car seats.
B0091W5WFQ|5|I Love the Exotac FreeKey Key Chain. It is so easy to place a new key on this and it doesn't mess up your nail polish. Best thing I have ever used.
B006DXWZQU|5|Great filters and built like a tank. Unlike the low end FRAM Extra Guard that has fiber end caps on the filter media, these Ultra Guard filters have a reinforced wire mesh media. Silicone ADBV is also a plus. A very good premium filter worth the price.
B003904GHG|4|The surface is nice and I'm sure will last a long time. The car side will not scratch or leave residue like cheaper products, although the mat itself did slide on more than one occasion. Perhaps a magnet on one side to help hold it in place would work.
B0002SPCBW|4|This may be the best product on the market today! Expensive, yes, but I think well worth the price. i use it on the car seats leather upholstery of both my 10 yrs old cars with great results.
B000CBO24C|5|I installed this in a Harbour Freight generator and it works great. No complaints about the product or shipping. I would recommend this spark plug.
B00480J4KA|4|This item came opened so I was skeptical if it was going to work in my car. After instillation it does work and is even brighter than I expected.
B000TCCVR4|5|We had misplaced part of the hardware for the mirror extension for our F150.  These replacements worked perfect.
B00529E88E|5|Arrived as described.  It really cleans up the engine bay.
B00IZR6ETQ|5|i used these plugs on my Ford Fusion SEL and whaoooo i had the power with least acceleration and had a good gas mileage.<br />thanks to Amazon
B00B8593GS|5|bought this, it showed up on time, fits my fixture and is plenty bright.
B00HNWVKY8|5|Great Odor eliminator! A must have for home, office, car, and pets...This doesn't cover up it deletes!
B009AA2J0U|5|Ordered two of these when my &#34;service air bag&#34; light came on.  Had both delivered for less cost than the dealer had just to diagnose the airbag sensor light - before dealer price for the part or replacement labor.<br /><br />Install comments (08 Silveardo 1500):  I disconnected the battery for 15 minutes before starting work as that was recommended by the dorman youtube videos for installation.  During this time I took off the splash guard under the bumper that sits in front of the senors.  Use a 10mm box-end or combo wrench to take out the old sensor and install the new.  I wasn't able to get a socket wrench in the tight space.  The wire connectors come out with a safety clip then I used a screwdriver to pop out the main plug.  I used some dielectric grease when installing the new sensor.  I put some inside the sensor and on the connector - hopefully this extends the life of the sensor.<br /><br />Total install for two sensors took about an hour.  Service airbag life went off instantly.  I did notice that one of my sensors had the whole housing cracked which I saw other places on the web as a common flaw with the location of these sensors.  Great way to save some money compared to going to a shop.
B000BW8U4U|5|As described made hook up much easier
B00CEX47QO|2|Didnt read the details. They are plastic, cheap feeling, flimsy, so they will not stop anything from scratching or cracking your taillights. I expected more for $40.
B00CXYVKKA|5|Love it
B001AGFI78|5|Seems to be working just like it is meant to.  Did have a bit of a problem installing it because the pipes are the same size as my tailpipe, so we had to get a coupler, but all worked out fine.  It's a good afforable muffler!
B006VOTFS2|1|Save your money, it will rust in 3 months time and the drone is unbearable! Honest review! I have had it over a year now.
B001GJ7CUK|5|Wow what a great product! It is an upgrade to the appearance of the boat trailer, and the materials and workmanship are top quality. On a windy day or in current loading my boat is a snap!
B0023VKVV2|5|fit perfectly
B001HBSU0I|4|Reliable
B000C9Q5YE|4|These are a perfect stock replacement for the LT1 (94-97) Camaro's and Firebird's. I put a set on my 95 firebird formula. It did seem to raise the car up overall, but the old springs were pretty worn out, so no surprise there. Taking out the rear spring  spacer/isolator (plastic ring that sits between the body and spring, often stuck up in the body) and just sliding 18 inches of heater hose over the top coils of the spring keeps you from getting metal on metal contact, but lowers the rear end about 3/4&#34;, giving you a nice level rake.
B0024NSYYU|5|My son was so excited when he received the lights. They even came with the bulbs. We are so happy with the product. I work at an auto parts and even refer customers to buy then at amazon with this company.
B000E4N2PW|4|What's to say?????   The product arrived on time, was the correct item, and installed exactly as the old unit came out.  Minimal time investment and appropriately priced.
B00FC22EDM|2|Update... so after using this since july 2015 one of the bulbs went out  and melted inside the socket  which required me to remove the whole headlight assembly and slowly chip away at it ....  July 2015 review: After trying Halogens, LED's and Xenon(this product) lights I must say these are by far the best I have put on my car. I put 8000 K and I love them. The LED's did not provide the brightness I wanted but the color was great!
B001G7U8US|5|This product is working great in my car. It is a good fit. It is made of a flexible rubber type. It should last a long time. My old boot was so worn out it had a hole on the bottom causing a massive vacuum (air) leak. My car was suffering from multiple vacuum leaks causing the car to misfire. Be sure to get a \\"smoke test\\" if you're unsure where the vacuum leak(s) are coming from. Good price. The product arrived very fast.
B004BWLTGM|5|The bars was so easy too install.Everthing i needed came with the bars.No drilling and the match was great.The crome was very shiny.
B000CEQDN2|5|Just what the doctor order for my solid lifter SBF. The cost was reasonable for hardened push rods for use with guide plates. I actually bought a couple sets.
B000G1568Y|5|The installation was somewhat fast and fairly easy. I made sure that I put the sticker (that is included) on the Cold Air Intake so it was visible to the smog station and passed with no issue.  This cold air intake was so worth the money. My car sounds amazing and the performance has increased by 100%. My pathfinder moves similar to my 2007 3.5 altima. AWESOME. Now if it only cornered as good, lol. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a street legal cold air intake this is worth the money.
B00020CAUG|3|Application: This box has 4 of ~1' x 3' sheets.<br />I applied the Dyanmat (i) inside of the door outer panel with ~50% coverage, laying diagonal strips, more in the middle of the panel (ii) inside of the door inner panel %70 coverage, with more around the speaker mount, i covered the big holes to break transmission. I used ~2 sheets per door. Then I applied (iii) one layer of Dynaliner foam right behind the speaker to attenuate the speaker back-wave (iv) one layer of Dynaliner over the door inner panel with ~100% coverage (v) some strategic placement to damp vibrating plastic trim pieces & wires.<br /><br />Results: I just finished all five doors & the trunk floor on a Subaru Forester.<br />1. Doors have a nice deep \\"thud\\" like heavy wood, compared to the \\"tin like\\" clank before Dynamatting.<br />2. Low bass quality improved noticeably.<br />3. Mid bass volume increased, noticeable separation between low and mid bass.<br />4. Slightly less cabin noise. However, more wind noise is now audible (gotta work on that next).<br />5. Door rattles gone!<br /><br />Total 7 hours of work, including clean up and one minor broken snap-fit in the door trim.<br /><br />Conclusion: A very nice upgrade to music quality with moderate decrease in noise.
B00S0G18Z2|5|Works great, fits perfect like oem
B009THA3DO|2|I use as 9005 DRL, in my 2002 2006  TOYOTA camry, but they didnt met my expectation, when it is at the DRL mode only one SMD(<br /><br />the bright spot) will illuminate, and hardly noticeable  at daytime.
B006OP39US|5|I bought this product to change the clip-on handlebars on my 2005 Katana 750 to a Renthal single handlebar.  These riser clamps are very sturdy.  I would highly recommend for someone doing a switch like I did.  The seller answered my emails promptly and delivery was fairly quick.  I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller.
B001KS6FPA|4|cleans well, does not chatter
B002P8GY0A|5|Of all the products I have purchased on Amazon I never thought about vehicle parts. I ordered one from a local car parts store.  It was wrong and close to $80.  I was amazed to find that not only could I get the correct side mirror but it cost considerably less.
B000COCUFM|4|I don't think I've ever gone wrong buying Sylvania lamps but I do prefer Philips.
B0006MTRJ2|4|decent quality and works well. I like the easy to tighten female end. Not much else you can say about a hose.
B008A030HW|5|This is a really great vest, and its definitely worth the price. The leather is very high quality and the internal pockets are deep. I does need to be broken in quite a bit, but that's how it is with anything leather. If you thinking about buying a leather vest, Leather Xtreme is the way to go!
B008TGMPIM|5|only used a few times so far, but they seem to be fairly cool and still provide some cushion. Holding up well, would buy again. They stay up perfectly.
B000VZF6YE|5|If you are looking for a top quality low pressure air gauge, this is it.  It's big, but the quality is top notch.
B000CINB38|5|they look nice, work well, easy to clean and easy to store.  What else can I ask for?  probably nothing, they fit the bill.
B002YCE5V2|5|Perfect fit, installs quickly, works great.
B00DBEPD9U|4|A nice bulb if you are looking to replace an 1157 in order to reduce amperage draw.  Not as bright as a decent 1157, but it works and has a noticeable difference between the high and low output.  Light is white with a bluish tinge. I like it.
B00W8J25WW|5|Very nice,very visible<br />not too big to block back windshield view as that is where I put it directly in the middle.Law enforcement are not always approachable due to the focus their job demands,so this is a perfect way to let them know my appreciation for all they do.
B00C8CD77G|4|FOR THE PRICE THIS ISNT THAT BAD OF A HELMET. THE GRAPHICS ARE GORGEOUS. i HAVE A VERY EXPENSIVE SCORPION HELMET FOR MY STREET BIKE. THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE PADDING AND COMFORT. THIS WOULD NOT BE A HELMET I WOULD WANT TO CRASH WEARING. IT FITS A LITTLE LOOSE COMPARED TO A NORMAL LARGE BECAUSE OF LACK OF PADDING. OVERALL SEEMS LIKE I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR SO I AM PLEASED
B00BEN2THO|1|Says specific - is not.  you have to have fabrication knowledge of you use this kit.  Buy a cheaper universal one it will be the same amount work.
B005DXNL0A|1|Had to send it back.  Bought the Can Am box designed for that model.  Paid more but great fit.  This box is well constructed but tries to be everything for every model.  Just too big.
B000Q65AY4|5|Even draining a 911 (~10 qts of oil) this has the capacity. It's not flimsy at all, and the large lip keeps the oil where it belongs. Draining out the spout requires a lot of maneuvering and twisting, like getting a smooth pour out of a beer boot, but it's not really a problem. Still deciding how I feel about the bright green, kind of fun, but doesn't look brilliant once it's full of dirty oil. A little tall, which makes low spaces (under a motorcycle) a little trickier. Overall it's the best oil pan I've yet owned.
B005CD8106|5|Great mattress for trailers.  Topped it with a memory foam for softness and slept like a baby.
B0031743MU|5|Product was well priced and the shipping was fast. It fit my 06 GS500 perfectly. I switched from a 16t to this 15 tooth sprocket and I love it. I recommend it.
B005G9B2PM|5|great product works good
B002C7DSIK|1|This net is far too wide for my 2013 Ford Fusion.  I attached it to the built in hooks and it is very droopy.  Not sure that it would hold anything useful.
B00CFL2SRA|5|These are OEM parts and the fit is perfect. I didn't need to remove the tires to install them but did need to turn the tires all the way to the right and than Left during installation. Total time was about 15 minutes for both sides and I am very happy with the look and function. Great product, and great look...
B000EH4V18|5|Great price on a very handy funnel.
B006R170LI|4|titled as with sticker, but no sticker included even though its written on the invoice, dont really care about that though. lights work well.
B00914F68M|5|Great accessory to my sons 4wheeler!<br />Adds look of better quality to the unit!<br />Also handy for coolers.
B009PJJJBS|4|This tube is exactly what i needed and I also purchased the Dorman dipstick. They both bacame brittle over time and broke. The handle on the dipstick for my 2003 VW Jetta 1.8T and the part of this tube that meets flush with the dipstick both were broken. The packaging was great for both products...installation was a little more of a challenge than anticipated but that's VW fault.
B008X61Z3E|5|They are built good.
B003XGYDE2|5|Worked perfectly right out of the box. Not confident on pressure gauge yet but will be fine tuning as I use device. completed fill in reasonably amount of time.
B002O95M3K|5|Good  product Work Real Good I Have A Head Light That Was Flickering I Installed This Product problem Solved. I Recommend This Product
B001CEXQSG|5|Love these
B0022ZXOE0|3|Too small, expected a bigger size, but it works
B0019OA7EA|3|The coat hanger served it's purpose, but it was time to fix it the right way. This part was not the same design as what was on the car (2002 Sunfire), but all the info said it was compatible. It fit just fine on the body side of the hanger, but on the exhaust side the strap going around the muffler did not fit up supper terrific, but worked with a little of &#34;let's bend this a little that way, and that a little the other way&#34; on the strap. Mufflers are likely a little different and probably fits the after market walker muffler just fine. This was to still hold up the original old OEM muffler. It was a little tough to fit that muffler side hanger on the strap into the body side bracket rubber isolator. After a couple of tries I used some dish soap to help it slide on in there (still with a little more effort than should be). In the end, the 5 minute replacement took about a half hour.
B000CSQJO6|1|I have been looking for the original NEW CAR SMELL AIR FRESHNER by Medo (the one pictured here with the bow) but have been unsuccessful finding it in stores.  When I found this online with the picture of the one I wanted I was excited and ordered A LOT.  Unfortunately, when I received it turned out to be the OZIUM AIR SANITIZER with the new car smell.  By no degree are the two alike. It's a shame the orginial was FANTASTIC!!!! I was able to return them with no additional cost but shipping.  So, I am truly grateful for their 'no hassle' return policy. ----UPDATE----I found another product made by the same company but sold as 'AUTO EXPRESSIONS FRESH air freshener in New Car Scent'.  It's exactly (scentwise) like the original pictured here.  The difference is that it is now in a spray bottle form.  It's a clear bottle with blue liquid.  FANTASTIC!!!!
B005WXDOTY|2|When it said waterproof, I was expecting it to be totally waterproof, but when it rained overnight water seeped in through the top where it had puddled, getting the seats and carpet wet.
B0009IQZJS|3|very heavy More is less
B0009QW4N6|4|good stuff.  protects the clear coat on the lips of my wheels and brake dust doesn't stick as easy.
B000CO9186|5|Truck tailgate fixed. Item worked great, and exactly as advertised!
B003ZZA3R2|5|very unique design and shape. I like it very much and I use it every day. I highly recommend this for any future purchase.
B0007QRLF4|5|Applied this to the black exterior trim pieces on my GMC truck about 2 months ago. The trim was weathered and faded pretty badly, so I applied this product to the running boards, mirrors, roof rack and windshield cowl, and I'm very pleased with the results ~so far. You'll need to apply this a few times on larger parts (such as running boards) to even-out the desired look. There's no greasy residue afterwards, so that's a major + !!<br /><br />Only drawback is that you'll have a rough time getting this off of the exterior parts that you accidentally hit when applying this product. I used lacquer thinner to remove the excess runs on the body of my truck, but had to re-apply wax to the affected area's because lacquer thinner strips wax away. Also, it's a *very good idea* to wear rubber gloves when using this trim restorer. Ask me how I know ...<br /><br />For hard-to-reach area's, I soaked a bit of this into a rag and applied it to the tight spaces. The rag will have to be trashed afterwards, so don't go using the good kitchen towels that the wife will be screaming about later on. Again, ask how I know ....
B00ESAZ4BS|4|This item is great, especially for the price!<br /><br />I wanted to purchase something that would keep dust + pollen off the bike when it was sitting, as I don't have a garage. I also wanted something that would protect it from inclement weather.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Fits bike perfectly. I have a Yamaha FZ6 (05) and purchased a 'Medium' size. The cover fits like it was made for the bike, and also fits if I leave my tail bag on.<br />2) VERY weatherproof. Rainwater does not get through. The elastic at the base is strong enough to hold the cover in place even in wind.<br />3) Easy to get on/off. The coloring makes it impossible to install it backwards, and it takes me less than 1 minute to take it on and off<br />4) Fits in its stuff sack! You don't have to fold it perfectly to get it to fit into the bag, which is awesome.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Venting isn't great, this does condense a little in cool/wet conditions. Would like larger vents.<br />2) No heat shielding, so you do have to be careful about putting it on right after you finish riding.<br />3) Visibility isn't great at night, wish there was a reflective piping so that it was more visible.
B001MQPQQ4|5|nice item well made
B0027I8CU8|5|perfect
B001VXXUWK|5|good product, I like it.
B00JIJ4LWW|1|Product doesn't work
B000GTTNZI|4|No hassles, quick delivery
B00CYOEQXW|1|The hitch came and there was barely any powder coat left on the metal.  It was beaten up to say the least.  I emailed the seller and asked for a call on the Mayer with no response in the last week.  The fitment of the hitch after install was terrible at best.  Won't be purchasing anything from them again.
B000GUWZSO|5|I removed the bearings from my 2001 DRZ-400 using a homemade draw bolt & sockets.  That was easy. Installing them with the drawbolt is another issue as the bearing must sit square on the opening or it gets cocked, hard to do   with a drawbolt as its hard to keep the bolt directly in the center of the socket.  I ended up pressing them in with my big bench vise, therefore no problems on the install.  Set the bearings down inside just far enough so there is room to install the seal. (1/8 inch or more?)  If you are using a sledgehammer & still can't get the swingarm pivot shaft out of your DRZ, seach 'thumpertalk'.com for drz pivot shaft for instructions on how to make a drawbolt.
B003UNFHPM|5|nice flush mount, easy install, looks great, great price
B000C5SGCW|4|Yes, this one does fit  1999  Jaguar  XK8. You will need two of these  Denso units  234 4735. equal to OEM  #15626-25607
B00CUAWJ8O|3|The kit includes (among other things) a spray bottle of Nano Shock, the Fine Grade Wash Mitt and their “Bubble Bath” carwash product.  Following their directions to the letter, I found that the Fine Grade Wash Mitt, when used in combination with the “Bubble Bath” carwash, left almost imperceptible, but nevertheless present, rubber traces on the finish, apparently from the rubber surface of the mitt.  I actually had to use a clay bar to remove these rubber traces.  When I placed my order for the kit, I also ordered the AutoScrub Fine Grade Sponge.  So after encountering this issue, I started over, using only their AutoScrub sponge and the spray bottle of Nano Shock.  It’s extremely easy to detail the car in this manner.  Doing one panel at a time, just spray on some Nano Shock, lightly rub with the AutoScrub sponge, and promptly finish up by using a clean, lint-free, high-quality microfiber towel.   The results are unbelievable, really stunning.    That said, I don't see that their car wash differs from (or is significantly better than) other quality detailing products.  I don't really need the &#34;Rain&#34; samples they supply as I already have some Griot's glass sealant (which works great, IMO), and due to &#34;rubber trace&#34; issues I encountered, I don't plan to use the mitt again, especially since the sponge works so well.  So I’m a fan of the Nanoskin products, just not the combination offered in this kit.  If I had to do it over again, I would forgo the kit and, instead, buy a spray bottle of Nano Shock, the AutoScrub Fine Grade Sponge and a one-gallon refill of Nano Shock.
B00EF3O17G|2|But it makes a great solid support for a ramp that doesn't ice and is less slippery! OK for use inside...
B00GI77DPY|1|I have a VW. Bought because it said it eliminates the error code, but this is incorrect. Should have read the other reviews.
B007SI83X8|5|Great boots for a great price.  Did shopping locally here to get the size correct and then ordered them online.  Size is the size.
B001AIZ5HY|3|Bought 2 of these for 2 cars.  I have purchased another brand 1 year ago and it didn't improve the headlight much at all.  I blamed it on the sanding.  Thought that maybe I didn't do a good job in sanding since it was by hand.  So I bought this one thinking that since it used power drill to sand, it will be better.  I have a 2004 Prius and the headlight is somewhat ozidized.  I sand it with all 3 sanding papers and pay especially attention since the instruction say to do a good job on the sanding to make the next step easier.  Once done, I polished it and it was better but still cloudy.  The sanding did improved the appearance but the polishing didn't.  I am thinking of buying another kidn of polishing to see if it will improve.  Will update once I try new polishing.
B002PWJRWS|4|Review for Folding Platform Step. I really like this step. We use it when camping and the last step is to high. Easy to haul it folds flat so it does not take up much room. Thanks.
B0007PYUR2|4|The Larin Cargo Carrier is just what I needed for my small car, a lighweight platform to carry barrels and other items I don't want or can't fit in the car.  The carrier came with both 2inch and 1-1/4inch load bars, which is much better than using an adapter.  The only small catch was that instructions were not entirely clear about how the 2 halves fit together, but once attached the rest of the assembly went perfectly.
B00HNGBOL8|1|Beware seller dirt sports where house ... I will see if they fix this ... ordered these and only got one set ... One upper and one lower not 2 like the description says ... I will update if they make good ..but for now 1 star
B00DSCZ20K|5|Easy to install, works perfectly! If I had known how easy this was to change I would have changed them several years ago!
B004XDC0A8|4|These are just what I was looking for holding down small, loose, food container lids during transits to potlucks and parties. It may take a bit of tweaking to work. May not work in all cases but I'm glad I have these for those  situations that call for them.
B004EI6A8K|4|Great product for the price. Had to adapt a different end to work on an older bike (1995) without removing battery. Where previous charger used to hook right in. This charger should hook right up to newer bikes and is easy enough to adapt if you don't mind two extra o rings and an end on your battery.
B000ETK5ES|5|Delighted with my purchase.  The step stool arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn't be happier.
B001C1HLYE|5|worked good
B009D47O1M|3|GREAT PRICE IF YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SPEND
B000K8TN00|5|Very cool antenna ball!
B002IV5400|5|Easy to install, check out the videos on YouTube.
B000KKCW10|5|work very good love it .
B0053WQV3A|5|I read other posts that this ran small. That is exactly what I needed and it fits perfect. My almost three year old loves it, but I don't think it would fit a child that wears a size bigger than about 4t.
B006X8BATI|5|Product compliments the front bumper area of the 2013 F150. Very easy to install (5 minutes max). Fit and finish is excellent.<br />Shipping was fast and packaged nicely.<br /><br />I would recommend this product for anyone with a Ford F150 to complete the front end look and protect the intercooler of an EcoBoost motor.
B00480J4JG|4|Was just as OEM for my Saab 9-3. It was the exact number of the one I removed. Could have been packaged a little better.
B001RZC1AE|5|Remarkable difference using the air filter, the bike has better response in acceleration, and in idle feels lighter, i recommend it!<br /><br />Notável diferença ao se utilizar o filtro, a moto tem melhor resposta aos comandos de aceleração, e em marcha lenta parece mais &#34;leve&#34; ao funcionar! produto altamente recomendado!.
B001SG8Z1Q|5|Therese are a plug. So they just worked. It is good to replace the plug every couple oil changes to make sure they don't strip next time.
B000QGOPO0|5|Not only OEM but it fit and works well
B000BWHXZ2|4|Product arrived promptly and was exactly as described online. <br /> <br />It is a large sticker.  I put it on my car.  It looks nice.
B0030WM7BU|5|It works very fine, I recommend it
B00TMFEFU0|5|Sweet item,cute and works great!
B0002STSQM|5|This gauge does not easily move around, like some of the other gauges I have. It holds the depth until you can view and record it. Nice product and a great price.
B000E7WLJW|5|It worked wonderful to keep everything together on our long trip!
B00976H1VY|4|I love the look of the helmet, I needed a large from what the measurements indicated and that's what I received, however, it must run on the smaller size of Large. It's really too tight on my head and make my head hurt after a while. I was looking forward to this helmet as I've never owned one that the helmet's chin bar unlocks with a single push on the release button. That was my initial reason for getting this. It also offers the air intake valves on the chin and the top of the helmet and on the rear for ventilation and cooling, which is a plus. The padding inside is very thick and the helmet does meet DOT requirements. Overall it's a great helmet but I think the best way to judge whether a helmet meets your specific needs and fits like it should is to go to an actual store where you would be able to try it on and make sure it fits properly.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Very impressive this product does exactly what it says and it fits the windshield like a glove. Customer service is superior I couldn't believe the manufacturer wanted to know how I liked the product before I even received  it.
B003TU662Y|4|Its a brush that spins.  The bristles are medium toughness.  I was using it to clean soap scum from tile showers.  Worked well but really took some time to get the job done.  Probably should have use something more aggressive.  The brushes held up well.  Will get many more uses out of this brush.  It is built well and seems fairly heavy duty.
B001QUAFJE|5|My husband was happy with the quality and price I paid for on this product.
B004131ZBK|4|I had to slightly change the screw hole to get it to open the door reliably.
B004XISIK4|3|It's hard to tell if this is accurate. I pump up my fatbike tire to what I think is a pretty high pressure, and it only says 12psi. How does one test a pressure gauge?
B003BZD03K|5|Works great and keeps the weight off my rv
B00KWDYY6G|5|Perfect Toyota genuine product.  Fits my second generation Lexus IS350 as expected.
B00DSR4HEC|5|NICE! Gorgeous addition to my wifes vehicle. Thank you
B00J54APR0|1|I bought it for my Camry (Attitude black) and now i hate my own car.... this thing is sucks. Do not buy it if you have new car pay to the dealer.
B00192JGN0|5|Seem to fit well and like extra tie strap at bottom for secure fit. Did not blow off in wind storm.
B0076KBPNI|5|Very good and usable device
B000ICNR78|3|The paint is very easy to scratch. Did not arrive with instructions to reset the lock combination.  Otherwise very acceptable. Bill Stewman
B00AIFZ3GS|5|This wire really suprised me because for the price it really wasnt that expensive compared to the overall quality that i got, and the picture of this being tied in a knot is very true this stuff is EXTREAMLY flexible, but the only  flaw i see is if your running around alot of sharp ridges becuase the insulation is really thin on this, but becuase im using this as the terminal wire to power a 4000 watt competition sub that was not a problem for me. Overall 5 stars.
B000765DBI|2|Says it fit my 1969 Chevrolet C-10 but didn't. Brackets were too wide. Paint chipped and scratched in shipping.
B005R4MJNU|4|Great clean look for my black truck. Not a 5 rating reason being the driving lights are not so bright. even with expensive bright white bulbs. Could've done better on the projectors. but still happy overall.
B0083UBYO0|5|Simply awesome. When used with Sonax Polymer Net Shield, it's just awesome.
B000CN72X8|5|This \\"kit\\" comes only with the front shifter bushing, but Amazon did a great job clearing everything up. The bushing is great! It noticeably stiffens up the shifts. One installation note: it is much easier to cut the bushing in half and install, it doesn't affect performance.
B00JIBFMY6|5|This product actually works great. Easy to use and effective. We was scrapping a car so tried it out on that and was impressed.
B004BI5692|4|Very pretty but kind of hard to figure out installation.  Never did quite get it to 'Click' in the way it was supposed to.
B0016LG0CY|4|A quality replacement part.  well constructed and will provided a long life.  The unit was easy to adapt to my system and the price was certainly right.  I can recommend this unit.
B000NW78EG|5|The quality of the pad is very good, larger than I expected and works great in washing my new GMC Terrain, great cost for the quality, turns the suds into lather.<br />The pad arrived on time, I plan on buying additional products from the manufacturer.
B001F02NCW|5|Great buy, would buy again.
B004R33MCO|5|these look good and work well. great value for money.
B008D70RP0|5|They fit my 05 tC and they sure do look better
B00480FIEG|2|I find the light no brighter than or whiter than the stock bulb.  This compares no where close to the actual Xenon bulbs I have on my other car.<br />Not worth 2X the money and half the life of regular 51W bulb
B000GTJ5I8|5|The type of tool i was looking for, help a lot to accomplish the work alone and most important safetly. A very safe tool for the work. Also the best price after look many vendors. Thanks.
B0002X520S|5|This product is incredible. I use it on Danner boots and water just beeds right off of them. It is a very good way to preserve your investment with good quality boots. Plus, since it isn't petroleum or animal based it doesn't void warranties...at least for Danner. The only &#34;drawback&#34; is that it makes your boots not as shiny. But if your worried about shiny boots then you shouldn't be out in the mud or rain anyways!
B001GRQVR2|4|Drivers side fits perfect. It even included a detail i did not expect - replacement anchors that screw into the floor. The summer anchors are hook and loop velcro type, but these replacements go into the floor mat ensuring non slippage. only problem is that the passengers side floor is not drilled nor it does not need to be. Therefore there are 2 holes in the floormats that do not need to be there with the likelyhood of water getting through to the carpet below.
B001O2T43M|5|This product was just what I needed and exactally what I orded. I appreciate the quick shipping and I recommend this to anyone. Thank you and God Bless.
B0002KKTYU|5|Bought a plastic battery tester at the local auto parts store and it sucked.  I took three readings, back to back, of the same cell and got three different results.  Their is a reason glass hydrometers are the standard for commercial battery testing, they work.  In Aviation its all we use, and in a pinch I though I could get away with the plastic CHEAPO.  This works awesome.  Gives great, repeatable, readings of the state of charge of the battery.  Price was great, shipping was FAST!  I would buy this again in a heartbeat!
B0038DCKY0|5|Beautiful color and shipped on time
B0041CC7I6|4|Not too bad, takes a little fine tuning to get it set up correctly, I'd give it 5 stars but one of the bolts fell out day 1. Have not tried it as a WI dshield yet, mine is set lower like a fairing as of right now.
B000FJVO24|5|Great price, quick ship
B00E5N1782|1|This product is below standard. The lexan is so thin, that it warps when you try to install it.A speed of 25 mph will cause it to vibrate, and bend. This product is not good.
B000CQ1XK8|2|I was pretty thrilled to see this product get good reviews and was extremely hopeful that this squeegee wouldn't suck like the other one I bought.  But lo and behold:  the squeegee is horrible.  This one seems to have really thick and hard rubber that doesn't streak away the water very evenly since it can't contour to the surface I'm scraping.  Additionally, the cut or mold isn't very straight, and so it only streaks away water in the middle of the blade.  I wanted to like this product, and would have loved it cuz everything else about it seems great, but the blade is the most important part of this product and it really failed miserably there.  Could be mine is just defective, but just be cautious if you're considering this one.
B00GLO4ZN2|4|It did come on time nothing wrong with it so I did paint it black and put it on looks great on my koup
B00GM4WKJM|5|Great Product! However, I may have to take special measures and add Velcro to the sides. I own a 2015 Jeep Patriot Latitude  )
B0083Z2S7M|5|Awesome! Suspect this will save my two rotator cuff repaired shoulders.
B0031HEIDY|4|Not as bright as the silver star bulbs but they are a definite improvement over the stock bulbs. The trade off of brightness for a longer bulb life is worth it and I will definitely purchase them again in the future.
B001GDGX7O|5|Love the sticker, its on my toolbox for everyone to see.  I would order from them again.
B00029KA8G|3|Don't even bother to put it on if you have a slack; you'll end up with even more slack at the end.<br /><br />I bought this item for my Mazda Mx-5 steering wheel. I did follow the suggestions(poking the holes prior, and waxing the threads) of installing the item using slant. Before I stitched the cover on the wheel, I gauged how much slack was there and for my case there was slightly lose and about 1 inch of slack without the stitch; right then I should have STOPPED.<br /><br />TIP:Don't even try to stitch it on if there's any slack on the wheel because the slack will be more obvious once you stretched the whole thing out.So to make things short, I did put it on my wheel and I ended up with 3 inch of slack and I had to take it off and put it on my sister's car which has a bigger steering wheel. This time the cover was snug on the steering wheel and at the end I had about an inch of slack that I spread through the section of the wheel leaving it slightly wrinkly.<br /><br />tedious even with slant stich; first try it took me about more or less 3 hours; the second try I installed it on my sister's car for only an hour. After this experience I would opt for a instant wheel covers that are expandable.
B000EQU1DQ|4|just as described
B00BAYO76I|5|I was really pleased with the size of this decal. I have it in the corner of the back window of my minivan. I didn't want something that was going to be overly large, but I wanted to express my passion for Zumba and this fits the bill perfectly. I like how subtle it is too, in the sense that someone who sees it would have to know what the third symbol is in order to &#34;get it&#34;. Peace, Love, Zumba.<br /><br />Finally, I found the instructions to be clear and the decal easy to apply. I waited about three months to write a review because I wanted to see how it held up under rain, a car wash, and just the general daily driving conditions. There has been no fading or peeling. I am very happy with this product. If I ever find myself in the market for another decal for my car, I would definitely buy one from this merchant.
B00FSC6JUA|5|Work well
B000DINKPQ|5|As most motorcycle riders would agree, it is not at all unusual to be cut off by cars and larger vehicles. Furthermore it is frustrating when you realize that the person in the car most likely will not respond to your meek and mild motorcycle horn. This is a serious safety issue, and I knew I needed to correct this. I have worked with FIAMM Horns on boats, and I was already familiar with their quality.     I bought both the High Tone & Low Tone horns as they were certainly inexpensive enough. Also purchased a weatherproof fuse holder, the Tyco SPDT 30 amp relay, and relay socket with wire leads, all conveniently available on Amazon. Installation was on a Yamaha V-Star 250 (formerly Virago) motorcycle. The stock horn on the Yamaha was feeble, and I wanted something more respectable sounding. Unfortunately, I found that space was rather limited, and I would not be able to install both horns easily. After listening to and comparing both the high and low note horns, I decided to work with the higher pitch after my wife pointed out the fact that \\"it sounded more like a motorcycle\\", but much louder than the stock horn. I felt that this was important because the main objective here was to bring attention to a motorcycle, and not sound like a car or truck, which could cause confusion to other drivers at a critical time. This is especially true if there are several cars and a motorcycle all converging on an intersection. Bottom line is that even a single FIAMM Freeway Blaster is effective, and I believe this addition will improve recognition by other drivers, and make biking a little safer.
B004XRI3JG|5|This is a very nice keychain for the price.  Definately not a cheaply made product.  Very happy with it, might just have to order another one for that price.
B007PGP638|4|only 2 weeks but so far so good
B000WSEUII|5|This Loctite Form-A-Thread repair kit was just what I needed to reinforce a bolt thread in an old M22 transmission I'm rebuilding. I'm happy with this repair kit.
B000MKB386|5|Excellent replacement ! Serves perfectly to Jeep CJ7 year 84
B00802GIW4|5|I just installed this lights on my 2011 kia optima! These lights are a huge improvement from the stock low beam lights! It tooks me a little while to install them because it was in tight spaces. But over all it was super easy to install them. Like i said i just put them in so i'm waiting to see how good they are over time! Just ordered another set for my fog lights!
B003PJ8B40|5|This is a good trailer hitch for my CRV. It meets my requirements pulling light trailers and mounting my bike carrier. It has a 2000lb rating and will pull anything my CRV is rated to pull. I feel this hitch is a good value for the money.
B0007TBP0I|2|Ok is as far as I will go.  A little overpriced.
B003JBL94I|4|Great product.  I have two dogs and it works like I expected.
B0064SOF6M|5|Great sticker
B009HBDPRS|3|love these lights but have ordered on 3 different occasions.  sometimes they come with some lights broken.  sometimes it doesnt stick well.  if u can put them inside headlight they work better i would think.  mine r on the outside so im not mad that i had to buy 3 or 4 to get it right.  not worth sending them back, it probably cost more to do that so i just kept them. the ones on my car now work well and have been on all winter once i applied them in 70 degree heat
B000CAIMMQ|5|Great product - exactly what the recipient wanted.    The only thing I could find any fault with is the extremely excessive packaging for this item.  The box was HUGE and so full of paper.  Seemed like an incredible waste in this day and age when we should all be doing our part to try and save the earth.
B00PARU8NC|5|Really nice construction and went on exactly as indicated in the instructions.  The dark smoke color of the material is almost invisible against the hood of my black truck.  Would definitely buy again...
B007HOG8R6|5|This lock is amazing! It definitely keeps my bike secure! And it can also be used as a weapon if in case I get attacked in the streets of New York City! That's quite a bit of weight to my back (which I don't mind parentheses at times)... I'm not sure if I would've bought it if I knew the weight of the item overall it gets the job done and then some so no complaints here
B0006305C4|5|my 1974 moto guzzi Eldorado loves it
B00859HI12|3|Works great in one car, not in another because of the nap of the carpet.  a great idea but ck your carpet first.
B000182F22|5|I purchased these hubs to replace the factory hubs on my 2000 F350. My hubs were so tight I had to use vise grips to turn them. This is a very simple job, I had replaced the hubs on my Jeep CJ5 about 20 plus years ago so I figured I could do it again since I am not a mechanic. The job took about 30 minutes to complete, you dont have to remove the wheel or jack up the truck. I started by removing the snap ring holding in the hub then tapped it with a hammer and it slid right out since it is plastic and cant rust to the rotor. I slid in the new parts after applying some marine grease and put in the new snap ring, the kit supplies a smaller snap ring for the end of the axle by my application didnt need it. Screwed on the outer hub in the free position, then jacked up that wheel to test by locking in the hub and spinning the wheel forward which turned the axle then back to free to test its release by spinning in reverse, perfect. Simple job with no special tools needed, only an allen wrench to attach the outer part of the hub.
B001PP4TY2|5|Holly crap, I think I just bought a new car, I do realize it is a new a car but being a 2013 Dodge Charger RT, I've had it for 6 months and it felt pretty slow. The car is now a powerhouse and I can turn off traction control, I am starting to feel a lot better about my car and it got rid of the factory transmission tuning that wouldn't allow it to down shift above 70 mph, of which really pissed me off, Thank you Diablo Sport!
B000BYELNC|5|best wiper blades I ever bought.  Did and excellent job cleaning the windshield with no streaking  Will definetly buy these blades again
B004UBCKYY|5|Was as described and arrived on time.
B00BTO90BQ|3|It seemed like a good light. The switch felt like it was way better than the really cheap one that burned itself up in my last spotlight.  The light lasted for several uses and then suddenly stopped working.  I opened the case and found a circuit board with a standard push-button switch and some semiconductors. A surface mount resistor was standing on end and the one next to it was missing so it looks like a defective board. I think one of the semiconductors must have failed from the miss-installed resistors because the switched tested good. The battery still had a full charge.  Too bad I can't get a new circuit board.<br /><br />Being able to plug it into any available extension cord is a plus.  The wall wart is built inside.
B006WQSVW0|1|We installed these 2 new Wheel Hub Bearing Assemblies just over a year ago and both are going out already.  I contacted the seller to see if they would warranty them and there was no warranty.  Beware of this faulty product.
B000VA93MK|5|really like this oiling can .found zero particles inside before using oiling can on motor rebuild. May purchase another one.
B000MS9VZK|5|Heard nothing but great things from other optima users. Even seen one start a old dodge ram with a giant gash in the side of the battery from an offroad incident. Decided to take the plung and buy one myself. No Regrets, Even got it here on amazon for a great price.
B00DNAOH2G|5|I love it. Is the best. It is easy to stick on the bomper, protects you from eny thing big, Im so happy with that and I like very much. Thank you!
B0007WP5G0|5|Installed it after waiting a month and a half to pickup the package from my mother-in-law's but wow! It was well worth the wait. Looks sleek, concept is simple, and install was a breeze. Instructions say 20 min. est. install, but I think it was just a little longer because we over estimated the complexity of it. Just 3 brackets holds it securely to the truck bed frame rails and the white film attached to the cushion is there to protect the foam's surface from getting marred. It's not double sided foam tape, just foam to protect the truck bed frame rails from getting damaged by putting the metal rails of the tonneau cover. No metal on metal and no paint damage. Great product if you ask me.
B001EOV46K|5|Nice and Snug Fit with the Curt Hitch,<br />Just Jam it in and keep the Mud & Rain<br />from rusting Your Receiver!.<br />Cheers! Curt<br />&#62;~iii~&#60;(
B006OSNUYU|5|I dont really know all that much about helmets but am impressed with this one. I cant find anything bad about this helmet. It can take quite a beating. Me and my brother use them for sword fighting out back as well as airsoft fights. paint still shines hardly even scratched(kinda amazing as our swords have a black color but have made no marks, the guns also shoot about 400fps but the helmet still doesnt lose paint). its really nice that the whole face opens up as well as the visor. this way you dont have to take off the helmet to cool off a bit. you just lift the face guard. I really like this helmet and would recommend it.
B0009VIQ1A|5|This duster is amazing. I know it is sold as a car duster but I bought it to dust my furniture. It is like shining your furniture with furniture cleaner; except you don't need the cleaner, just the duster! Amazing!
B000UOGREO|5|Bought these for my 2006 Dodge Charger R/T Daytona Torred these are what I've searched for and recomended by many sources they worked great came in perfect condition changed out all 16 plugs at once and I've had no trouble with me since
B00371X7CW|5|i used these when i need to jog in the sand storms. a little tight, but still alright glasses to wear
B000B8JUNY|5|Good product.
B00192KZQ2|5|GREAT IDEA
B009WQ3JFQ|5|Perfect Fit and nice product!  Very happy.  Shipping was fast!
B002P8H5SA|5|Shipped quickly and everything fit perfectly.... couldn't be happier :)
B00MJ3ZQNC|5|Excelent.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Emblem faded after a month on car. Wouldn't buy this again!
B004HJJOZC|4|Good helmet.  Seems sturdy.  The visors swap out easy if you read in the instructions.  Decent protection for the price.
B0016H0O6G|4|The light kit itself is great. What I learned the hard way: if you are sending the wires down the inside of the trailer rails (rather than clipping to the bottom) be sure to use the old wires to pull the new ones. Snaking/fishing the wires took me far longer than attaching the lights and making the connections.
B006WQRQAI|1|So my GF's 06 Scion XB had a bad bearing/wheel hub & needed to be replaced & we figured amazon would have a much cheaper option to do so than the toyota dealership. We were correct on that fact. Good guys over at Western Tire told us to make SURE  we purchased a US made bearing hub assembly. Ok. Let's go with this Detroit Axle place.. sounds like it's probably made in the US yah? 50 bucks!? Fantastic.<br /><br />Box comes, everything seems new & the product looks great. Good packaging & box art & even has a pic of the &#34;We Can Do It!&#34; girl flexing on the front. The product seems extremely new & well built. Smells like oil. Must be a good sign. So far so good.<br /><br />I get to Western Tire, have it installed & the installation specialist comes to the waiting room & says to me... &#34;Let me show you something...&#34; With the car still jacked up, he grabs the wheel *The rear right in this case* & it moves. Not round & round like it's supposed to move but back & forth. There is at least 10MM play in this hub. He then picks up the box & on the back of it is a big bold sticker that reads &#34;MADE IN CHINA&#34;.<br /><br />Companies, I understand that in order to keep your prices down to the consumer you have to cut costs by outsourcing but there comes a time where your product quality HURTS because of you trying to expand your brand. I'm not saying that everything made in China is bad quality. This product however, is made in China & is REALLY bad quality.<br /><br />If you're reading this, I can't stress this enough; you can't put a price tag on your piece of mind. Purchase something that's a bit more expensive but that you won't have to buy again in a year because it wasn't made well. Buy good quality NOW so you won't ever have to worry about it ever. So stay away from Detroit Axle.
B009S9RCPU|5|Just be careful installing them, I had no issues with them at all. Patience is key when placing them on your car.
B00AQKC7LO|4|A good little lamp.
B002KDT7JK|5|from the start of the s to the y is about 6 inches long. great shiny chrome color has not faded. easy to put on
B0026P96HK|2|It's an ok product
B001QRTZR0|5|Very heavy duty. Overkill for my use in a small sedan but it has been very hard to find quality lead post terminals. Seemed to offer a very good and secure fit to the post. Only concern might be loosening of the lug connection bolt from vibration, solved by using a jam nut or nylok nut.
B007NH6FP2|5|looks great had to return though too small the quality was amazing would recommend to someone who wants leather pants
B0067DO8LG|5|Very good product, especially for the price
B000IETTS2|5|Absolutely love these, they really make the car look nicer and they are great at keeping the rain and snow out of the car!!
B000CC0HZ4|5|This clothes bar is perfect for my use. I am a baseball umpire and use it for all of my shirts and jackets. Love it
B002S9UYM0|3|I have yet to see a helmet that says raider so I don't know what that implies. Brand or style? I do know it will not fit on any of my full face helmets (scorpion, Icon, Bell) but did fit my 3/4 (brand unknown) helmet with ease. Clips work well. With gloves I did struggle a bit but could do it. Because of the design the loops on the helmet straps need to be large enough to fit the rounded or square clip through it. This is the only thing that makes it incompatible with other helmets. If you have about a 3/4&#34; loop it will work. Otherwise you may just end up frustrated and unhappy.
B0041CC7IQ|4|works good for longer rides. Your  definitely not going to throw this on for short rides. Takes a while to set it up
B0015353XU|4|The directions are generic and the ground point screw is blocked by a connector above it. Had to do a shade tree mechanic fix with a clamp for ground
B001G7MBMG|5|Perfect for my 2006 Sentra!
B000B5SA2Y|5|It replaced an AquaMagic IV and works perfectly. Husband says it was easy to do and only took about 10 minutes. Was glad to have the new hose we'd also ordered. A new seal was included with the toilet.
B0031I4HL6|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 Saturn Aura XE. Very easy to install. No problems.
B006M337VI|5|the best thanks
B00OFCFYZU|5|Excellent, great value ev charging station , charges my Ford Focus EV in 5 hrs!
B0002Z9QXU|2|I was unaware that one would need to apply silicon to the winshield first for the wipers to work. I do not believe that I had read anything about this in the product description. The wipers are not special at all as I had first believed. I missed this one, so of course it is my own fault for not reading up on the product more.
B004V4Q3NY|4|Good for making the lights on your car, and thus your car, look more expensive by replacing the standard yellow lights with these cold white bulbs.  But they do not put out any more light than stock bulbs of comparable wattage.  In fact it appear to be a little less light than the 10W bulbs that were replaced.  After all, these bulbs do have a thick blue film.  I like these in the lights that are more aesthetic than functional, such as puddle light on doors.  Conversely, these are going to get replaced with LEDs at the map and dome lights, as I actually need those to see inside my car at night.
B001187HQU|5|Overall this is a great item, the only issue which has been commented on in other reviews is the location of the power supply cable.  On my bike i simply had to notch the license tag at the top with a round file (approx. 1/4\\") so the cord doesn't get smashed between the tag and the frame.  Looks great and works well!
B00G71N4GI|5|looks great on my car
B0081SR4AW|5|removed radio from my Mercedes with ease
B0000UZ514|1|This is much smaller than it appears in photos, and quite honestly, it wouldn't work for me so I sent it back.  Make sure small is what you're after -- really, really small.  ;)
B0045K2Q9Y|5|come up.. so far so good .. works like a fuse is supposed to . I dont care that the number isnt written in white because i can tell a fuse by it's color ...so can you .. it was a bargain for me.
B0050VH4O4|3|Average brightness. Works okay but not blinding by any means. Light is blueish white and is average quality. Overall I'm satisfied because they're cheap.
B0047YK4WY|1|It sucked. I literally broke it within five seconds of owning the darned thing. I put my keys on it, swung it around, and my keys flew off... Don't waste your time or money
B007HRUV44|3|came shipped as shown in the photo....no bag or box to protect it...so had to wash it out with bleach to make it safe for fresh water.  More photo's are needed of it and wha size the threads are for vent and out line.
B001P25N9K|5|I have used them many times before.  They have done me good over the years.  Once I get rest of machine work done, I will assembly engine and go racing!
B005JZMR2A|3|It says it is rigid.  I guess because I wanted to just make the seat belt longer, I didn't pay attention to the word \\"rigid!\\" The fact that I don't love it is my fault!
B0009OMY92|5|I have only used it once so far and it performed as expected.
B000SXCLIS|5|Fits great and durable
B0022XKLUM|2|Good
B005M9EN0W|5|Exactly what I wanted for that dark look.
B005DJD69U|5|This mount has exceeded my expectations.
B009YRI64C|5|:)
B000JFJMFK|5|exelent
B0083HW1Y0|3|I will say that I was very impressed with the quality of the material.  The stitching looked great, the material was very thick and looked like it could stand up to some serious use.  The color was a bit darker than pictured; I would say it is more of a medium brown, and not beige.  I would have been willing to overlook that if it had fit through.  Unfortunately, it did not fit my particular application, which was a 1989 Buick Park Avenue, thus the three star rating.
B000TKHMWK|5|This a great product. I have had the battery for about two years and it continues to perform well. From jump starting my car to running a large boom box or lights.It is heavy but it is also heavy duty and has never let me down. Best jump starter/power supply I have ever owned.
B00065L2D8|5|Works like a charm for filling the tires on my boat trailer without having to pull the trailer up next at car that has a cigarette lighter.  I just clip the adapter up to my boat's 12V trolling motor battery and plug in my 12V portable air compressor.  It's as simple as that.  And, you can't beat the price.
B0001EXM7S|5|Installed easily, does what it is suppose to.<br />This is my second set in 20 years and recommend it to anybody
B007NKXGL0|3|The picture is wrong and the instructions are wrong.  There are no Rigid hardware bolts and DO NOT remove the OEM nylon nut inserted into the frame as directed in Rigid's instructions.  I called Rigid to verify, and indeed the instructions are wrong.  I wrote the following on the 40\\" Rigid light review and am reprinting it here so nobody else has to go through what I did.  The install is painless once you know what to do.  The only thing that is not in the directions is that you will need to remove some of the hood bumper plastic housing which I did very easily with a grinder but can probably be done quite easily with a hacksaw or even a hacksaw blade with one end wrapped in tape.  Enjoy!!<br /><br />------<br /><br />I have the Rigid 20\\" lights mounted in the lower grill of my Ford Raptor, and they are awesome. Unfortunately they did not come with any [mounting] directions, but a call to Rigid directly and they emailed me what I needed within 10 minutes. Also unfortunately, they did not warn me that the mounting for those 20\\" lights required drilling into the frame. And so I was not surprised when these 40\\" Rigid lights came without the proper mounting hardware, and perhaps even worse, incorrect mounting directions (even though they were specific to my vehicle - Ford Raptor). If you are purchasing these for a Ford Raptor, you can probably mount it with the included hardware if you can find a bolt to replace the OEM Torx bolt with a smaller head on the bolt (which should not be hard to do - the replacement need only match the threads and does not need to be a Torx). Either way, the Rigid instructions are incorrect at this point, as they tell you the OEM bolt is a Torx 40 when it is really a Torx 30.  Beyond that, the Rigid instructions tell you that you should remove the OEM hood bumper bolt and its nylon body-affixed nut - DO NOT DO THIS!!!  Rigid sells a Ford Raptor installation kit with different brackets, and even though the instructions still tell you to removethis OEM hardware, it is wrong (yes, I called Rigid and they told me to use the OEM hardware).  Also, you will not be able to re-install the hood bumpers unless you modify them.  I have a grinder and just ground away the necessary plastic from the bumper housing to re-install it.  I'm sure you can easily do the same with a hacksaw or even just a hacksaw blade with some tape around one end.  You'll see what I mean when you disassemble it.  The light is most surely a 5-star, but I removed a star due to the horrid instructions and lack of insight as to what the installation will entail before you buy.<br /><br />So for the Ford Raptor - The light will be installed with the electric pigtail on the passenger side (below the battery).  Loosen the lower hood bumper bolt (it does not need to be removed) and remove the upper bumper bolt (you will be able to slide it up and off at this point).  These two bolts are a Torx 30.  Then install the Rigid brackets to the ends of the 40\\" light but do not tighten (you'll want to be able to move the brackets around a bit).  I used an 11mm end wrench for these Rigid hardware nuts.  Then hold the light up in place as good as you can and use a marker pen to draw a line where you'll need to remove some plastic housing material from the side and back of the inside portions of the left and right OEM hood bumper housing (maybe 3/4\\" in and 1/4\\" deep).  Slide the hood bumpers back in place (do not install the top nut or tighten the bottom nut yet).  Then set the light with loosely attached light brackets on top of the trimmed bumper housings (you will need to lift a bit to get the Torx bolt in the bracket).  Tighten the top Torx bolt leaving it loose enough to slide the light side to side.  Once the Torx bolts are in loosely, check to make sure you've trimmed enough hood bumper housing, center the light, and then tighten all four Torx bolts on the hood bumper housings.  Center the light vertically by rotating it up or down and then tighten theend nuts (11mm end wrench).  Do not over tighten these Rigid hardware end nuts, as this is also the shock mount for the light.  A little beyond snug should be just fine (the nuts are nylon locking, so you aren't going to lose them).  This should do it.  FWIW - I also got the Rigid black plastic protective covers for my 20\\" and 40\\" LED lights.  They go on easy but are tough to get off, but they will certainly protect the light when not in use.
B000CQBND0|5|Works great on a 1000 CCA tractor battery.  Now I can disconnect the battery and it doesn't require constant recharging.
B00HWMCCW8|3|Works but would be nicer if edges were rounded instead of sharp. Also original paddles are smooth, glossy. Thes attachments are rough and hard edged in comparison. For now they're ok but not up to VW'S quality standards. Eventually, I'll probably replace them with a &#34;nicer&#34; set.
B0000AXY62|5|This receiver lock works great.  I use for trailer hitch rack and also for bike rack.  works well, easy to install, and keeps racks locked and safe.
B004YJP8CS|1|Unfortunately, this unit broke shortly after installation.  The white plastic piece that guides the cables into the metal rail assembly shattered after I tried moving the window up and down for the first time.  I had to remove the new unit and install the old unit so I could close the window.  I ended up purchasing a different unit.  Amazon did refund my money with no issues.  I chalk this up to poor product quality and not to any shortcoming on Amazon's part.
B005T6C9IQ|5|Perfect fit!
B003CJ927I|5|Very satisfied with product and timely service.  Thanks!
B0015FYQ90|4|It has made my changing lanes to right much easier and safer. I dont get a better view of driver side blind spot though the way I have it set. Still I feel my driving is better with this mirror. It was easy to just clamp it on existing rear view mirror.
B004W97D3C|1|we got these and we put them on my 2001 Jeep Gran Cherokee and they worked beautifully....for 2 days!!!  Since the 3rd day, we cant get the blinkers to work!!!  These are a rip-off. DO NOT ORDER!!!!
B001UG4WIO|4|Beautiful and durable decal, made with great precision. It came in an envelope without any instructions so I cannot give it the full 5 stars.
B000KZ0ASW|4|Wanted to replace a remote lost in a fire.  Remote arrived promptly.  Needed technical assistance to program it.  Turned out my 20 year old car's computer wouldn't accept a new remote.  Discount Keyless promptly offered to accept a return.
B00EN9Y6WW|1|THESE ARE NOT AS DESCRIBED. They work, BUT definitely not Osram/sylvania. And they have a blue tinge to them. I was very un-impressed with this product. Don't waste your money here.
B000VBEG0S|5|After about 2 years of ownership on my Jeep JKU, I had worn a hole through the driver side floormat.  Needing replacement, I thought i'd try Weathertech.  So far they have been exactly what I was looking for.  Good(semi)OEM looks, solid construction, and gets the job done.
B00CP6KXCW|5|Item as described, fast shipping. Thanks.
B003C0173E|5|Well made for the price.  I had to remove the breather and plugged it; no big deal.  I'm not sure why, but my 350 sbc wouldn't idle well until removed the breather and plugged it.
B000WK2OSE|4|The fly screen is a great windshield for those of us who don't like windshields.  It could 2 inches taller but otherwise, it's great.  I would recommend to anyone.  It was very easy to install
B001FHQQJG|5|Worked great! Better than OEM part.
B006X7ZJ9G|5|High quality product at a great price!  It looks great on our car and was easy to install!  The shipment came earlier than expected which was a nice surprise.
B005EMGSW8|5|Works perfect out of the Box unlike others like it. Very impressed. Comes with just about everything you need. I did have to use almost an entire kit of wire loom and Electrical tape and took an Entire Saturday. But looks beautiful.
B002NS8Z2C|5|Nice and bright, work great!
B004OJZBSE|5|Worked exactly as specified. Seems sturdy.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone considering it. It has a good price to quality ratio.
B00JKSVT5S|5|It was as advertised.
B000NW6X24|5|Came in AC Delco packaging and works great.  It was one of 3 parts I needed to fix the secondary air system on my 05 Trailblazer (the other parts being AC Delco 214-2222 [air injection valve] and AC Delco 219-351 [air injection valve gasket].<br /><br />I did not have to replace part AC Delco 215-454 [secondary air pump] and you may need all or none of these parts to fix your Trailblazer.  Be sure to do appropriate troubleshooting to determine what you need.
B00G49NZ30|5|Love this wax. Easy to apply on once a month and wipe off. Lot easier than other paste waxes and because it is not white it does not leave any residue on your car.
B00ESH1ETC|5|This cover works great! It withstands harsh winters and still looks great while protecting the RV! Would recommend!
B0022ZZUWY|4|Seems good so far! Just as described
B00CWUHMT8|5|Its as I saw them
B0031XMM9A|5|Exactly what I needed and worked perfectly.  Well constructed and recommend to others.
B005ZOXYHW|2|Couple LED's burnt out after about 3 months.  I even put silicon around the wires and water still got in these.<br />Brackets are very flimsy....borderline aluminum foil weight.
B0095RBYW2|4|These appear to be well made, solid chrome plating, and most importantly, they fit!*  I had a previous set of Genuine Toyota locking lug nuts that did not have the washer on them.  For reference, the stock Toyota lug nuts do have a washer on them, so you get dual contact on the rims where the washer contacts and where the tapered lug nut end contacts.  My local tire shop told me that the old locks were the wrong kind due to no washers, and to replace them.  I just bolted them on tonight and they tightened up just fine.  *they fit on my 2008 Toyota Tundra TRD with 20 inch factory aluminum wheels.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I have no data on how they will hold up to wear and tear and consequently, will not rust!
B000M4W2AU|5|I like it very much, useful device. I will install it as soon as possible, because our winter is very cruel.
B005024BZS|5|my son is a snowboarder and he loves it. It looks great on and is lots of fun! thank you.
B0016HPUS8|5|This switch/sensor was a perfect replacement for the defective switch on my 2003 Chevrolet Silvarado with the 5.3 L V8.  If you don't have the socket designed for this switch (Lisle 13250 Oil Pressure Switch Socket ), then it is impossible to install,  With the $8 socket , it is almost, but not quite, impossible.  A couple of long 3/8 in. drive extension bars and a flex joint are necessary for both removal of the old switch and installation of the new one.  The big hint is to place the new switch in the socket and feed it down to the invisible, empty hole on the block (behind the intake manifold and partially under the firewall) and start it by hand.  Once you are sure it is not cross-threaded, and that the socket is still firmly seated on the new switch, you can tighten with a ratchet.  Otherwise, you run the risk of breaking off the new switch's wiring socket (which you will almost certainly do in removing the old switch).  The entire operation is done by Braille.  Unless you have extremely small hands, a couple of band-aids are also necessary as your hand will be bleeding from all the sharp objects you assuredly will encounter down there.  My project went smoothly and took only about 30 minutes from start to finish.<br /><br />This unit registers variable oil pressure readings.  It does not just stick the needle in the middle of the gauge and keep it there until there is a failure (like a warning light).
B0007OWD2M|5|Another user on Amazon thought this was good so I bought it and wasn't disappointed. You can't even see the glass. I bought one for a coworker and she loves it too. Better than Windex by far.
B00EU1DDSQ|5|Perfect fit for 2013 Chrysler Town and Country, fit and finish same as OEM.
B001SLEM7W|5|Good experience  Quick shopping tricks on amazon.com  [...]
B0031HRQTM|5|It took me longer to open the package than it took to put these on. Remove the old ones with a small screw-driver prying on the clip and these just snap in place.<br /><br />The trunk used to fall down. Now I have to push it closed. These have only been installed for 3 weeks so I don't have a report on longevity but I hope they last a while.
B00JC827UM|1|Hate it hate ittttt
B0000AXY3C|5|Super sticky. Doesn't shrink we'll.  Great for patching burn holes or reinforcing folds.
B003CJLXY8|3|I had ordered the Sports Parts Metallic Sock Liners 16-007-01. When reading the description, I didn't notice that they were a Men's size. I am hoping to be able to re-sew so that I am able to wear them.<br /><br />I have a pair of these from years ago, I love them, they work really well and keep my feet warm.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sandy
B004XOQNF0|4|flexible assembly helps finding a suitable mounting location.<br />The nipple that threads onto the filter cannot be torqued down and that can result in the nipple coming off with the filter.
B007HRWNBS|4|Had to send back first one.  Did not work right at all.  (Don't know if it was my fault or the product?)  No problem.  Amazon had a new one sent and it worked the way it was supposed to.
B003BZINKU|5|Does the job I needed for my back wiper. I can see clearly now in the rear when it rains.
B0041CFWTW|4|These are the third set of grips I've tried for my blacked out Road Glide and are the most comfortable.  I have cruise control and probably could have gotten along without the Throttle Boss.
B004O3JE3I|5|Used this as an emergency repair for the radiator overflow tank on my BMW. I was 250 miles from home when the tank cracked and sprung a leak. I purchased this from an automotive supply store, removed the tank, laid it down on the ground, cleaned the area of the crack, applied the Q-bond to the entire lenght of the crack (about 5 inches) and then wrapped the once around with duct tape. The repair held for the drive home. It may have lasted longer but I replace the tank when I got home. This is impressive because the tank is under considerable pressure and gets very hot.
B001H9K7WY|5|works great nice turn around
B00C250RUO|4|I was hesitant to rate this product but after a month of usage i would like to give it a thumbs up! It fitted funny when i first wore it but my big head gradually broke into it and the fit is perfect now. The smell is awful but with time it should disappear. The helmet arrived eralier than the anticipated date like another reviewer had mentioned. I am worried to crash test this product on the freeway as it doesn't stike me as strong a material as other helmets i've had in the past. For under $40 you can't go wrong with it if you're looking to save some money till you can get a $150+ helmet at your local store.
B007L2JNT4|5|The fit is perfect and they are very stable while driving. On and off is a snap. Nice storage bag protects and keeps them together and ready for use. Really helps when towing an eight and one half foot wide trailer.
B00B73W0EI|5|Fine
B0049Z8AP4|5|worked great thanks
B003CN30X6|5|I got these for my 2&#34; Cobra fatty bars. This is a very good quality product  but I didn't realize how much adjusting would be needed. I took tools with me and made adjustments during and after rides until I got them just right for me. You couldn't buy them back now.
B004LY01W8|2|This \\"holder\\" is made for American made plate holes. Does not mount on BMW directly. Not suitable for my needs, just another cheap plate holder. Not sure it will last long, but looks nice on a car.
B000FW2MCM|5|Nothing says your a retired old man like a compass on your dash, except a compass on your golf cart dash.
B000COS0GK|5|Worked great on my 20&#34; chrome dodge rims, oem lugnuts rust out replaced with dorman an they rusted out after 4 months. These seem very durable
B001EOV492|5|Very high quality, excellent finish on the ball and the mount.  Good price too, as good if not better than the more pricier options.
B008Y8U60E|5|Very good original
B005GBS07I|5|Goes on very well... Looks great too! I love it!
B0036HHRU0|2|If you have a Droid X stay away from the G4.  Any incoming call will not ring through your headset.  It will just stay silent.  This is a known problem and Cardo says it's the phone.  Problem is the phone works with 5 different A2DP headsets so far for me.  The phone is worth about $400 retail, the G4 sells for $225.  Guess which one is getting replaced?  I do know the Sena headsets work well with the Droid X so soon I will be replacing the G4.  My advice is to check the G4 with your phone before you buy.
B000SL0R9K|5|What you see is what you get.
B00280ASK2|4|The two front rotors came well-packaged in heavy cardboard boxes (one rotor was wrapped in plastic, the other not).  No rust, since they had the usual &#34;remove before use&#34; waxy/oily coating.  I didn't check them with a dial gauge after installation, but they run smoother than the 85k old Brembo rotors that were on the car, and the Brembos  had 0.001&#34; and 0.0015&#34; lateral runout (spec runout limit on the car is 0.003&#34;, but they were worn down to minimum thickness).<br />My only complaints about the EBC rotors are that one had a couple of small dings on the inner radius of the inboard surface - from the appearance of the dings, it looked like another rotor had been dropped on it after machining.  The second rotor had something I haven't seen in any the dozen pairs of rotors I've replaced over the years - a semicircular grind in the outer edge.  I guess it's part of the &#34;high speed balancing&#34; EBC refers to.  The cut is about 0.7&#34; in the thickness direction of the rotor, and the front rotor minimum thickness wear limit for the car is specified as 0.87&#34;, so I guess it's OK, but any removal of material at the outer edge of a front rotor like that makes me a little uncomfortable - thinking about thermal stress or corrosion.  I've posted photos of the dings and the cut so you can see what I mean.
B002VVGPE6|5|I have two of these for my FLHTC... the 6&#34; dark smoke for local shorter cruising in and the 8.5&#34; light smoked for touring...  Both are awesome... especially at higher speeds... You can feel the front end being pushed down...  I have no problem with the distortion in the shield as I don't look through it... I look above it... and when I have to look through it I do so in the middle of the shield with much less distortion...<br /><br />I would not bother with any other windshield now...!
B0031HXZOW|4|Installed easily and so far it's working properly.
B008H2HWSQ|5|The replacement blower for my Jeep Cherokee was perfect.  It's a shame they go bad around 75000 miles. But all is well.
B00DSMEL2A|5|Cleaned my motorcycle pistons up really well. Going to rebuild the carb for my old truck soon, and expect it will handle that just fine, as well.
B00DUFP5AC|4|Looks factory! Attached to fenders. A little thin, but OK
B000SJOEQY|3|The only draw back of this sticker is the perimeter.  When you receive the sticker it appears to have a nice white perimeter around the steal your face logo.  However, when the sticker is removed from the backing it turns out that it is clear and that it was the backing that was white.  This perimeter &#34;ring&#34; is about 1/8 inch thick and looks bad when placed on a surface (Imagine placing clear packing tape on something).  I had to use an Xacto knife to cut it off.
B00A9MZAJA|3|Wrong part. I should have looked at the old one before I ordered. The price was too good to be true.
B000XRHRZQ|3|One of the clips was broken off upon arrival and at the bottom of the box. Probably needed to be packaged better. No instructions were included in the box.<br /><br />Our wheels are apparently not big enough for these so make sure you know the right size before ordering!
B00VXT8K2M|5|Great cover ! easy to put on and to take off. I just put it in the trunk when im done with it. The liner inside is soft so it dosnt scratch the car . Have had it only a month. So far so good.
B00WE0YHA8|5|excellent
B0058P3D2E|5|after popping the lock key out, i almost got a new expensive key, but this piece saved my a lot of money.
B000B6CVZU|4|good fit.
B001OMNA1Y|4|I had read about the problems fitting the straps around the roll bar with a sound bar. I found it easier to get the buckle stuffed between then used a plastic putty knife to push it past - no problems after that. The middle seems a little loose, but nothing of any concern. Great item and the pockets are a bonus feature.
B00XN6LS9K|4|Not the highest quality but decent for the price. Very easy to install, took less than half of an hour.
B00BGZ1VJC|4|Fits my remote perfectly, however, picks up lent very easy.  Howdo you stop that from happening?
B0050DWBJA|5|I purchased the entire adventurer Goal Zero set-up with collapsible solar panel, battery cartidge charges for AA & AAA batteries, reading light, iPod music speaker, accessories plug & reading light.  The panel charges everything from iPods to cell phones, headlamp batteries to other electronic devices. It charges surprisingly fast, can be hung off a backpack, hiking & charging devices simultaneously, is very lightweight for all that it offers, durable, and ideal for either hiking/packing, car camping, or any other off-grid situation. This was money well spent.
B003VLBPJA|5|Great deal, functions.
B00DS3M6HQ|5|Got these after I tore my hand up pretty good a while back and I love em! They look great and are pretty comfy and they do their job well. I fell off and planted my hand in a thorn bush, and while my arm was scraped to hell, my hands came out great. They also have a nice little grippy strip on the brake fingers which is nice. Definitely would recommend, not bad at ll for the price.
B0002NIJQW|5|I put these on my 01 Dakota and they great. For future buyers, they are 11 inches wide and 19 inches long. The set comes with 8 screws that I wish were a little longer but they worked. They're mud flaps, they do their job well.
B000TIJ4P0|2|the pins do not line up with mats
B007TGKDT6|1|Did not fit to my Chrysler PT Cruser.
B004FKWZL8|1|it does not fit very well into the bell helmet, i should it bought the bubble type shield for half quarter open face bell helmet
B001E50AN2|5|not a great product but looked when new!
B0056NRJ4Q|5|they fit perfect
B007SUAWMG|5|ΜΟΥ ΑΡΕΣΕ ΓΙΑ ΤΟ ΑΥΤΟΚΙΝΗΤΟ ΜΟΥ.ΕΙΧΑ ΜΙΑ ΤΕΛΕΙΑ ΣΥΝΑΛΑΓΗ ΧΩΡΗΣ ΠΡΟΒΛΗΜΑ. ΚΑΙ ΜΙΑ ΓΡΗΓΟΡΗ ΠΑΡΑΔΩΣΗ ΤΟΥ ΠΡΟΙΟΝΤΟΣ ΠΟΥ ΠΑΡΙΓΚΙΛΑ  ΣΕ ΑΡΚΕΤΑ ΧΑΜΗΛΗ ΤΙΜΗ ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ.!!!!
B007P05FBW|4|The directions are not that great. You have to tighten the nut more than the recommended turns
B00498FKWC|5|Parts fit like OEM. I have since bought more stuff for the car. I saved a lot of money doing it this way instead of the local parts store.
B003B0B0ZA|5|Good product. Installed with no issues. If you are looking for a good set of locking lug nuts for your 5 series this is it. Only issue is it took over a week to get them.
B001L6OZP8|5|Thank you
B00CPYC9BC|5|Perfect for extending my RV grill location
B00009WC2N|1|Do not buy this item! I was told by bulldog it is an old model and Amazon should not be selling it. It came out of the box not working and now I have to pay to ship the unit back to bulldog for repair. It was pretty easy install but now I will have to wait a week or so to get a working replacement. I do not think it is fair that a product I purchased 4 days ago should be replaced by my refurbished original. The issue in a nutshell is that there is no range at all. I have to be within inches of the box or yellow standard antenna for it to work. I even went to the store to get a new battery for the key remote but it did not help. As for the people at bulldog the tech and the customer care rep were very nice, but there policies are subpar at best. I even feel bad writing this but it is true.
B001A4FKA0|3|Works if all you need is the ability to read what codes are triggered. No ability to do any advanced PID searches or datastream reading but for this price its not too surprising.
B00C80HOHM|1|WASTE OF MONEY.  I plugged this into my car and the wire overheated and started smoking.  It didn't stop smoking and now my car smells like burnt plastic.  Very dissapointed and upset.  Do not bother with this little light. It sucks anyway
B0031747DA|5|These offsets are heavy duty and the chrome is thick.  Perfect add-on to the existing pegs and now they're in a comfortable position.  Very quick shipping from Leather-up!
B0047RKS72|5|I love my lights I bought them as replacements for my tail lights on my 07 f150 and ended up also replacing other bulbs in my truck inside and out truck looks nice wish they were a bit brighter but they look great and love the price...
B000COO1UO|1|Cover was too small for the pressure gauge body.  Once I finally got it on, I found that it had split a few days later.  This cover was a waste of money.
B00HAMP5Y2|5|Great product and great customer service.
B0012APN4A|5|I've used a lot of different brands and types of trailer end plugs and these seem to hold up the best that I've found.  So far these don't seem to loose connection due to corrosion.  They don't break near as easy as other brands.  I would recommend using the Endurance type female plug on your truck as well.  The pins are stronger and don't bend so they maintain a good connection with heavy use.
B006ZOLDJ2|5|I am using this with a solar power system, they work great and I received these very quickly from the manufacturer.
B000BRFTLC|5|Replaced my old 9100 55 Amp that went bad, with this 60 Amp and it works great! No problems here.  Shipping was quick too.
B00E90UW6Y|4|Product fit well. For the price I can't complain. They have a little more slack than CRG or click a roll between the base and the lever but those are $170. So all in all I'm satisfied. They seem to be of pretty decent quality.
B001PTTG1E|3|Not very bright and a lot of the LEDs burnt out the first day
B00MTUWAWU|5|Excellent decal just as described.
B002OPEPDC|5|Received them in the mail and now I can flip my wear bar. I have more than enough bolts to change the bar a second time if needed.
B000F5SQUQ|5|This is the second pair of PIAA Xtreme Force 4700K bulbs that I have purchased.  The first pair was ordered online directly from Hong Kong at a higher cost (both product price AND shipping fee).  When one of the bulbs burned out (after a year of use) I figured that I would give Amazon a try.  Surprise! I found the same bulbs at a lower price and they shipped via USPS for a fraction of the cost.  There's a lesson learned there.  Seller shipped on the same day as I placed the order, and they arrived in quality USPS packaging and padding.  The bulbs are brand new and exactly as ordered.  VERY satisfied with the purchase experience.  I highly recommend this seller.  As for the bulbs themselves, they are very close to HID in brightness, and with a decidedly blue tint to the crisp, white light.  Like PIAA's other Japanese-market (JDM) bulbs, these are worth the money, and much better than the DOT bulbs sold on most auto parts web sites.
B00FHI2P7Q|1|These did not work, DOA...
B00KTIA9EK|5|Received on time and as expected.  Works fine with 2005 Chevy Suburban and the glow in the dark feature is kind of cool.
B000CB1L32|4|The real brand is three 555 from Japan, and I think is good, fix ok.
B001GN6YLE|5|Why no one or even the product description tells you that you need a 3/8&#34; carriage bolt to get these D-Rings to work is a bit crazy.  Hopefully, you will benefit from this tid bit of information, whereas I had to wait until they were delivered in order to check the size.  You can look long and hard and you won't find a D-Ring in this price range &#60;$7 coupled with this high quality.
B003XGK4H2|2|So what ever &#34;coating&#34; is used does not last very long. After 6 months these black tips were completely stainless. Granted they were on a truck an exposed to the elements, but seriously I was hoping for a little bit more durability. Otherwise the build quality seems to be pretty good.
B00CA5POM2|5|PERFECT!!
B000KYX0TE|5|Excellent product and super fast delivery. What more can you ask for? The programming instructions must be followed exactly, but within 5 minutes I was all set,  and for much cheaper than the dealer!
B007SP1XWE|5|I'm an avid truck leaser and at the end of a lease the last thing I want to do is pay fees for stains on seats. I like to buy things with customer reviews but seeings as when I bought this only a single person had left some kind of feedback. However they had pictures that looked promising and how can you turn down this camo break-up? I got the covers about 3 days after purchase (A+) and they felt a lot more heavy duty than I was expecting (A+) fit was phenomenal and really does come close to a glove like fit (A+). Its honestly worth every penny I spent and was icing on the cake when I found out they were giving away free shipping. 100% satisfied!
B001P2GDAS|5|These westin nerf tube steps installed easliy on my Silverado crew cab, about 20 minutes per side using only hand tools in my driveway. They look good and are of great quality. They come safely bubble wrapped in the box in case of rough shipping. Installed alot easier than the DeeZee brand I bought for my previous truck.
B004JN3N44|5|Fast shipping and product was exactly what I wanted.
B000C5YCUM|5|AS ADVERTISED
B00JFWKM2K|5|I was skeptical on whether or not we needed it, but we travel with two pets and this is the only model that automatically resets itself back on in the event of a power surge.  On a recent trip, we were staying in an rv park when we encountered rough storms. Our power went out several times within a couple of hours and every time the power went out, the surge protector powered everything back up, including A/C without me having to go outside in storms and manually reset at the box. I was concerned by other reviews regarding the size, but I was able to find a home in one of our storage compartments in our travel trailer and I really don't believe the size is a bother. Peace of mind knowing that the A/C will power back on if we're away from our camper makes it worth every penny.
B00BC4P4G8|1|Awful quality. I bought this hat as a present, and after the recipient simply tried it on for the first time, it already started ripping. The base of the hat is thing and flimsy, this hat is just a waste of money.
B002R0KYCA|5|I ordered with Prime and it was at my door in 2 days, and the light is perfect. It looks just like the stock ones when they were new. The only problem is now I notice how old the passenger side original looks! I might have to replace that one too because this one looks so much better. Everything fit just right.  Thanks!
B008ZVNGM0|5|perfect fit and looks great!!!
B004TBQVW2|4|Love weather tech but one of the visors doesn't want to stay in place
B0015PMZMU|5|This is a very good tool. Oil it and all the parts, use a drop of oil while making flares, it's really good. Also use the reamer on your tubing cutter and hit it real quick with a file. That combined with lubrication and you will flare like a PRO.
B003W5O1BY|3|This sunshade works great and fits perfectly and therefor wont fall from lining the windshield.  Unfortunatly, my wife finds it difficult to roll up and store.
B0000TX80U|4|Goods were delivered in very short time, well packed and damage free.<br /><br />Installation instructions were adequate for non-professional installers.<br /><br />An installation frame should be offered as optional.<br /><br />Instructions regarding GPS connections should be more detailed sothat one doe4s not have to call the GPS and Radio technical servive to verify correctness and compatability.
B00V7COU9W|5|Fit with little modification to the bumper! Looks amazing and the light output is equal if not better than my lowbeams! Does not come with instructions but feel free to ask me for help! Great quality and shipped fast!
B000CQBG1O|5|Perfectly as described.
B000CGDCXO|1|I put this for my 2000 stratus and I really kno these cars inside out ive owned and worked on quit a few, but anyways I get this part for my 4cly 2.4l and it arrived different then the picture, go figure its the one for the v6 cuz its curved at the end where the connector plugs into and I need the one that's displayed in the picture.<br /><br />but on a side note if ur stratus is in idle and dies a lot, but runs fine when u hit the gas most likely u will need an idler, just not this one
B00469L32A|2|The first set that I received worked well and lasted a long time. The second set must have been from a different manufacturer as the brush part separated from the handle on all 3 brushes after a relatively short time-frame. Same car, same wheels.<br /><br />Disappointing as I do like the brush design. Worked well with my wheels, but I'll have to find a different type.
B000C2SJYK|5|aaa
B00K889FCI|5|Great product!!! Truly works!!! used it today on my BMW X5 Headlights (which had plenty of oxidation). Now my headlights are crystal clear. This saved me like $400-500 dollars, I was thinking of purchasing new ones but decided to try this product first. And I am very satisfied with the results.
B004J0SV1W|1|the wires on the fan moters fall's out off the back so do not bye this
B00C7Y04TY|5|I bought this from a seller for about $1 plus shipping.  I had Maaco taking the dents out of and painting my $250 1996 Tercel DX, and they were glad to install this part for me.  My car looks like new, and I don't have a crappy looking car with a broken door handle any more.  Now my car has the kind of magnet that Borat asked the car dealer about!
B00OM60DH8|5|Great for corvette z06/zr1. Easy to install, took me about 10-15 min.
B002P8V6K8|3|Average quality mirror:<br />1- the mirror it self as small distortion in the image<br />2- the inside handle for the adjustment of the mirror does not work at it should
B00MWEJBFC|5|I have a Nissan Pathfinder. These mats fit great. I had to cute the two smaller back seat mats to fit and the cargo mat. The front and middle mats were a perfect fit. I definitely recommend these.
B00H1E4QFI|5|Got it 4 days before it said i would, very happy with it
B001SLEMPO|5|This was shpped immediately and received in great condition althought it had a strange smell which did go away after time.Fit my seats perfect and match my interior .Very happy with purchase.
B001P2AQP6|5|Works great. Easy to install and remove. Doesn't vibrate when driving. Would be nice if they were convex mirrors though. Makes it so you can see the back of the trailer clearly.
B0000AZ8GN|5|Used them for a service of a 1967 Alfa Duetto 1600.  Work like a charm.  Much better than the Golden Lodge specified.
B00DHQYZPU|5|Great deal on OEM fleece filters.  I started doing my own service on my 2006 SL 500 after it was out of warranty and found that going to the dealership to order parts to do basic maintenance was still unnecessarily expensive.  With the price on this filter and the deal I got on the nine quarts of Mobile-1 oil (separate Amazon purchase), I was able to change my oil at a fraction of the dealer cost.
B00480FIEG|5|I was a bit worried about ordering bulbs online, but these came fast, worked great, and are definately brighter than my old ones. And most importantly they actually fit. I will be ordering more auto parts from amazon in the future. Great deals!!!
B00EXIEVO6|4|convenient, easy to use, utilizes idiot lights
B000IYC96G|5|Went on and worked well on our 2006 Chrysler PT cruiser.  The old ones had worn out and couldn't even keep the hatchback door up anymore.  Was a big relief that these went on easy. Recommend two people do this.  One to hold the door while the other changes out the lift!
B007KCX5PS|5|totally satisfied, excellent seller.
B0088EXE12|5|Adorable online and even more so in person!
B00DHGPVKI|5|I love it.  Keeps my battery charged for a vehicle I don't use that much.<br /><br />I bought it because I don't use a vehicle that often and the battery kept discharging.  Im talking about not using the vehicle for a period of 1-2 months.  This product is great for that.  I own an optima battery and this does the job that I expect it to do.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone that owns optima batteries or even regular batteries.  It is designed for optima batteries but has a feature for any other batteries.
B0014COKYU|4|Does not have a nice fragrance. But on the otherhand  works. Becarful on painted surfaces, does remove color
B005U30NTU|4|The crossbars look like original equipment except for the screws to hold it on. It was easy to get the covers off by using a plastic putty knife and following directions on u-tube.  One of the screws stripped when I installed it. Overall, I like them.
B000WEKQ3K|4|Good fit, and helps save the carpet. I work outside and track a lot of stuff into the truck via my boots. I just remove the mat and clean as needed.
B000HLO7QA|1|missing bolt ,& missing tab for sway control
B0015S1G6I|5|These are just good, effective brakes. Put them on my wife's 2010 Mazda 3.  She probably has a few thousand miles on them and no issues. Brake dust is minimal and no squeaks. No change in brake feel either.  Good price for a good product. I will probably buy them again when the time comes for another set.
B001VC27G6|5|This is the second Access roll up cover I have owned, first one was for a 2007 Ford F150 this one is for a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500. Both have exceptional fit and the quality is really good too. So far there hasn't been any problems of any kind and the do it yourself installation process is pretty simple.  If you're looking for a roll up cover try checking out the Access line, you wont be dissappointed.
B002DQBXAA|4|*Update*  12/13/2012 -  I have had this for three months now.  It still stays up on its own.  The corners do curve in now slightly, but I still get around 95% coverage of my entire windshield.  I will update if things change.<br /><br />This sunshade fits in my 2013 Audi S4 very well.  I would give it 4.5/5 if I could, as the only down-side is that it is starting to get a little flimsy from being rolled up so much.  But to this day it has stayed up without the need of putting down the sun visor.  I am very happy with it.
B009DJQQXO|2|brand new and it grinds as it goes up and down. Moves slow. I just hope it doesn't fail as quickly as the last one did. (not this brand)
B00GHK6VDM|5|Very good. Fits perfectly
B000JFJDNG|1|Shipping was fast but missing parts
B00062ZEYO|5|great stand.
B0072W6CRY|5|A great product!
B00KV7FMNC|3|Didn't fit my Fiesta - too small
B005SB0JJS|5|I was unable to install these so I had my local Chrysler dealership install them. I noticed that each front one is cracked, but too late to claim it. I had easier installs with WeatherTech
B009FBS7KK|5|One of the nicest frames u can buy for your late model mustang!Yes its a little pricey but the quality shows in weight and letter etch,it really stands out and looks Great on my 87 Stang GT Vert!as will it on yours no matter what the color Dont hesitate Buy This!U will be happy!and it came fast!even has black caps to cover ugly screws to complete clean look u want on your Pony Pride and Joy!
B00HOJVICO|2|Faulty button. Leather isnt ass tangable
B002AKIAVE|5|The tool is very useful is you have stretchy belts. It did take some time for me to learn how to use the tool, but after I figured it out it was easy.
B00JA1C0JY|3|I bought these headers because I was on a budget but desperately wanted some added power and sound for my GTO.  This was my first time purchasing and installing a set of long tubes so please, bear with me as I do my best to give it an accurate write up.    First off, I was pretty impressed with the quality of both the welds and the design.  The welds were nice and everything looks to be sealed well.  Inside of one of the collectors, though, there was a bit of rougher metal and a piece of cut primary tubing that wasn't removed.  It was in there pretty good and I didn't have a pair of pliers long enough to reach end and remove it so I left it alone.    Second thing that impressed me was the material of primaries really are made of 304 stainless.  304 is not magnetic and I checked it with a powerful magnet I had laying around the garage.  The connectors are magnetic but appeared to be made of pretty good quality material so I hope they hold up okay over time.    As for the install, there are no directions and it is not a direct bolt on.  The passenger side installed fairly easily from the top  side of the engine after removing the oil filler neck and guiding it through.  As for the driver side, that was definitely more involved.  It went in from the top but that is after unbolting and removing the coil packs, disconnecting, unbolting and lowering the power steering rack.  Do this before attempting to put the header through as once the rack is lowered and there is room, the header WILL slide through freely and possibly hit you in the face and give you a black eye.  Don't ask me how I know..    Once that header is in, you may have to remove a small brace that's held in by four bolts connecting the frame and the undercarriage.  One of the bolts might have to be cut, too, to make room for the headers.  The GTOs are notorious for having engines and other front end pieces that don't line up well and mine was one of them.  The driver side has nearly an inch to inch and a halfless room between the rails than the passenger side.  I'm still running into an issue where the front primary tube is touching the frame as it runs back to the collector.  Had I have noticed it before bolting up everything I'd have marked the area and created a little more clearance using a BFH to motivate the primary to bend elsewhere.    Speaking of bolting things up, the package does not include any hardware so you'll have to reuse your current bolts.  Do yourself a favor and with the extra money you saved, buy a set of Stage 8 (8900B) locking header bolts that will look good and keep your header sealed.  The kit does come with actual metal gaskets but I also used the money I saved from the lower price of the headers and purchased some Remflex 2008 gaskets for enhanced sealing.    Once you have the headers installed, all you'll be able to bolt up from there is the resonators and the O2 sensors.  Buy new ones as the old ones will probably strip and not want to screw in without damaging the threads.  Oh, and as these headers are more like mid-tubes than long tubes, the O2 sensors will plug in without the need for extensions.  The kit also comes with plenty of very nice two bolt 3\\" band connectors but the \\"mid pipes\\" won't attach to the rear portion of the exhaust and the connectors won't seal them to the resonators.  To finish things up, you'll have to have connector pipes made and welded up to everything.  Had everything bolted up directly and no outside assistance been needed, I would have given a higher rating.    Overall, I'm pretty happy with the kit but it needs improvement.  The primaries measured out to 1 5/8\\" internal diameters emptying out into 2 5/8\\" connectors.  This has allowed my engine to breathe much easier and added a very good amount of TQ and HP throughout the entire powerband.  Once I get the leaks at the band connectors fixed and make sure everything is buttoned up nicely, I'll hook up my HP Tuners and wideband O2 sensor and get everything dialed in.  It's a shame the kit isn't a direct bolt on as I am very happy with the power, looks and sound.  The multiple issues that have to be addressed keep me from giving it 5 stars.  As it is now, 3 to 3 1/2 stars.    Hope this helps!
B000BO4WZY|4|Good product. Only place it lacks is on outer plastics. I put on over and over and the grey plastic on the bumper is still different colors and looks dried out. Would buy again. Did three cars worth in a bottle.
B004MXN71U|1|the thermostat was okay-didn't realize i needed another part to go with it-still working on getting that part--maybe you should think about selling as a set then people would get everything they need to replace the bad thermostat--could be another cold winter for me
B0006Z9SQQ|4|Have tried several different wipe-style cleaners and find that this Armor All product does as good a job of cleaning my GT's interior as any of the products tried -- and some of the other products cost a lot more!<br /><br />These make cleaning fast and easy and they seem to give the car that 'new car' clean fragrance. In just a few minutes the steering wheel, instrument panel, center console, door panel, back speaker deck, glove box and other plastic, chrome and vinyl interior component turn from dusty to sparkling clean. Using these wipes beats spraying on a cleaner and then trying to wipe it off with a cloth... I go through four or five wipes each time, so the canister should supply enough for five or six cleanings.<br /><br />The reason for four stars -- the quality control of the wipes' canister is just not good, as we have had brand new packages opened dry, others drying out within a short period of time, and then others staying nice and damp all the way until the last wipe was used. Since we like the wipes but no longer trust the canister, we dump the contents (wipes and fluid) into a large zip-loc bag for safekeeping. That works well, but we really should not have to do this... so, four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Other Armor All products that we really like are the tire foam ([[ASIN:B00099XKKY Armor All Tire Foam Protectant 20 oz (1 lb 4 oz) 567 g]]) which produces a rich looking satin finish, the leather wipes ([[ASIN:B0006Z9SRA ArmorAll Leather Wipes Canister, 20 Wipes - Cleans, Conditions and Protects]]) which are great on my GT's leather seats, and the protectant ([[ASIN:B0007898UI Armor All 10228 Original Protectant - 28 oz.]]) is excellent on the dash and all interior and exterior rubber.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product if you have a similar need... but think about keeping them in a zip-loc bag or something with a good seal.
B00BP4DDHM|4|Use these in the RV and they work nice. Previous lights got hot the are nice and cool. Not as bright as I had hoped but still work good.
B000IYNR0I|5|We order this product over the weekend and got the package on the following Thursday. Thank you for the fast shipping. My husband spend 3 hours to replace it. The hardest part is remove the old radiator from my 95 Honda Accord, after he remove the old part, it is easy to put the new radiator back in. It's a great deal and save a lot of money for a new radiator by DIY.
B00G186POK|5|Worked perfect, arrived on time.
B004A2WXWW|5|I used this as an under-hood trouble lamp. Seems to be of decent quality construction, we'll see how it holds up to the heat.
B00AKYZBL4|5|EZ to install. Complete for my 2006 Heritage Softail Delux. Non fuel injected.  I don't wrench but could do this with eaze
B0009OMY92|5|Over the years I have purchased many of these devices.  This one is of good quality, but they all wear out with extended use.  So then you get another.
B002V0AMX2|3|I assumed this product would come in some color scheme, not.
B00ALK1Q5W|5|Very good kit but if you are replacing a T25 you will need to modify the hot pipe, T28 it would be completely bolt on.
B008BYQ2XG|5|These items are  perfect for the trunk on our Harley Trike.  We can pack enough in them for the whole weekend trip.  The quality is great and they are a convient size to carry in the hotel.
B00F6RC4JC|4|Not the brightest led bulbs but the best for the money
B00KTG52A8|5|Fit good fast shipping. Happy camper.
B004GCDU32|5|it was perfect fit just like the one on our truck the only thing was wish it would have come with the retainer clips
B000BZG5ZI|5|Perfect fit for my 2000 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4.0L inline 6, eliminated the code for faulty O2 sensor and turned engine light off!
B002R1C846|5|This light looks really good on my Thunderbird. I used it to replace an old yellowing light and it made a huge difference in the appearance of the car. My T-bird is beautiful again. Especially after putting new headlights on it also. Was bery easy to install. Just unscrew the screw at the top and take the old one off. Unplug it from the wiring harness. Plug the new one in and screw it back on.  It was that simple. Comes with everything including the bulb.
B0001L0DFA|5|Wish I had this a long time ago!
B002FRLRU8|3|Dimensions were listed in product specs, but handling it in person, my first thought was &#34;not worth $50 and should have bought the $26 battery operated one&#34; on Amazon. Had problems with putting in the batteries. Very hard putting in 2 D size. I first thought it took C size because the battery holder was too small. Flashing is bright enough at night and how I will be using it. Daytime, not so much. Big problem is the flashing beacon has to be on level with the eyes to be useful. On the ground, or on the roof of a truck, the beacon seems useless because it will not be eye level with drivers. Cannot change flashing pattern, or frequency. The $26 dollar one did, but not this $50 beacon. Magnets hold it good.
B007NZ08VG|5|Installed these on my 1987 325is. Simple to install. I removed the old ones by removing the center hub nut and with a little tap of a hammer from the rear side the assembly slid off the shaft. Installation was fairly simple, I did need to give the assembly a few taps with a hammer, but I used a large diameter socket that fit over the shaft. The socket gave me the ability to apply even force around the assembly sleeve as I tapped it with the hammer. So far I have driven about 5k, looks and drives well.
B000EDOSSI|3|Bought the straps to secure my bicycle wheels to the frame. They are a few inches too small for this purpose, but otherwise seem to be okay.
B00KAHHYU2|4|This would have earned 5 stars had the tape
B001EDBEZM|5|Great product - works well for my soap making and the price is reasonable.
B008032PCA|5|Great Price. The auto parts stores wanted over 280$ for an ac Delco one....this worked just fine.... 2001 Chevrolet Astro Cargo van.... (Tip--- if you go on YouTube there are videos that show where to cut in the floor to make an access hatch to get to the fuel pump---get creative and make a sturdy cover and make sure to seal it---but it sure beats dropping a tank and dealing with rusty brittle gas lines and tank straps).
B000BQWMFO|5|This was rated by Consumer Reports as the best wax for your buck, and I have to agree!<br /><br />This liquid wax goes on very easy and comes off even easier.  Oh and if you happen to get some wax on rubber or anything else it comes right off.  The only suggestion I have is after you \\"Think\\" you've removed all the wax take it out into the sun and look over the care because you will have missed a couple of spots.  The only complaint is it hard to see the dried wax.  Other than that this is a wonderful product.
B005K9053S|5|Great looking key chain! Not to light weight or heavy. Perfect for the Harley Davidson lover in your life! The finish on it is very nice also!
B001XUD46S|4|Perfect fit and easy installation, Would recommend. Only complaint is the were a little scratched up already but I am sure it would happen at some point anyway but they were new.
B008542QTQ|5|We purchased this emblem for our grandson who was just accepted to NYU.  He loved it and put it on his car right away. It looks great!
B00R1STXX4|5|Worked out perfectly.
B001EOWQ62|4|I have a 2002 F150 and needed a class III receiver. Everything needed to attach the receiver to the truck was included. The only tool needed is an torque wrench. It will take two people to install, to hold it in place while you get a nut on each side hand tight. After that one person and the torque wrench. Its a good class III receiver and should last the life of the truck. I recommend this product.
B001GMFITE|5|Looks great. Bolted right up with factory bolts. I also didn't use the bolts it came with. It took maybe ten minutes to install.
B009I0G7VY|5|Bought for a Christmas present for my borther in law. They are great quality and he loved it and was very happy.
B00009RAX7|4|Overall I like the Actron CP9135. Easy to use, fast access to the codes that your car is producing, and let's you know if you're ready for the emissions test. Of course now that I have it, I'm sorta wishing I had a model that allowed the next level of diagnostics - either allowing real time monitoring (CP9145) of the conditions or a snap shot (CP9175) capability which provide more background for diagnosing the problem. I guess it's all detective work - and the code itself is part of the puzzle - but more information is better. Still - for the money the Actron CP9135 does a nice job of getting to the codes, and erasing them if need be. So for basic capabilities - this is a good unit. For more advanced diagnostics, take a look at some of the higher end units.
B000PDI1E4|5|I BELIEVE THEY ARE WEATHER TECH MADE.  PERFECT FIT.  HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION. SHOULD LAST VERY LONG.  I'D BUY THE REAR ONES IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE AT SUCH A GREAT PRICE.
B000WJBMQK|2|i purchased this to sync my carb's and amazon showed this tool would work for pilot adjustment on a 1996 honda shadow ace vt1100. it does not work on that model bike. very misleading and a waste of money.
B000C10EVW|5|Fits perfect, good choice, recommend to all.
B003IOITIK|5|When you are a do it yourselfer and your engine light is on, you need to read the code(s). This device allows you to view and erase stored codes. The codes come up quickly and the device seems pretty rugged. I typically Google a stored code and then I can figure out possible repair suggestions.<br /><br />You can buy nicer code scanners and you can spend a lot more money. If you are like me, and you use this once or twice a year, this device is great.
B00EB07J5E|5|Got this for my computer and it's awesome!
B00DB8GNSQ|5|It's a very solidly built grill, not cheap at all.  much nicer than i was anticipating.  Looks awesome moment my car. Takes a little time to put together but worth it.  Definitely recommend.
B00HHNM2UE|2|12 months after purchase: A lot of corrosion, figured it would survive 1 full winter.
B009I3BO9Q|5|Great item and price.
B00KVZM95S|5|Awesome fit. Looks good. I ordered another one.
B0030CVH2K|5|I purchased these for my husband, who did not tell me that he had already purchased a pair for $40 more from a local retailer.  These at $40 less are a better pair than the ones he purchased.  The parrot face/grip is what he wanted and they are excellent.  Longer than the ones he purchased too.  Guess who gets a nice pair of jumper cables in her car?  Yep!  Happy about it too!
B000A0CAC6|1|I bought this for my 2006 BMW 325i  as it stated that it was a fit for my vehicle, but I had to find out the hard way after I had my air intake opened up i took out the air filter out of the box and to My dissapointment this was not the right fit...E90s have more of a triangular shaped air Filter and this is a rectangular shaped filter so there's no way this fits
B0056DJOVC|5|I got this to put on my Honda Ruckus.  I love it and it fits well.  It's a chrome plate with decals on it basically so it may not hold up but for now it rocks!
B000C4087Y|3|you pay for the name. I bought it just because everybody said to buy, for being the best. I don't think so
B0041TUA1A|5|I've had it installed for about 2 weeks now. Installation was easy. The whole thing comes black. My car is a different color, so I grabbed some aerosol spray primer and clear coat from the local auto shop. Got my car paint code from the inside of my car door and ordered aerosol spray paint from automotivetouchup.com. I made a box lined with clear wrap or you can use sanwrap and taped it to the box. I wanted to make something dust free to where I can spray the mirror. I used masking tape and sanwrap to cover areas where I didn't want the paint to go. I cleaned the outside of my replacement mirror from any dust. Placed it in the box and propped it up. I used a shop rag wrapped in plastic bag to prop it up so no dust gets on it. Sprayed 3 layers of primer and sanded it down with 600 sandpaper. Then sanded it with 1500 sandpaper. Then sprayed 4 coats of paint on it. Let it dry for a few hours before putting clear coat on it. Then sprayed it with 4 coats of clear coat. After putting clear coat, I waited a day before installing it.<br /><br />The installation was easy. You have to take out the inside corner speaker. It pops right off. It has 2 places in odd spots that clip it on. Then unplug the power cord attached to the mirror. Use 11mm to Unscrew the mirror you want to replace. Attach the replacement mirror, screw it in, attach the power cord and snap the corner speaker part into place.<br /><br />Other than painting and looking for right sized tools to remove the mirror, it took about 20-30 minutes to install as it was my first time replacing a side mirror.
B00BD4VNQC|1|These are a thick plastic with light gray double stick tape. I put one on mine and it really looked silly. The light gray adhesive tape shows around the edges, it is too long and it is so thick it sticks way out from the vehicle. Once you put one on, you can't return them, so if you do try them, hold them up to the car to see what I mean first so you can return them.
B0040CYWX0|5|perfect fit for my truck plastic panels and retaining plastic shields in the engine compartmentexcellent price took 2 days to receive
B000ALG0KS|5|These are great, got them for my 2001 Cherokee and they work perfectly. The hatch opens so well that I don't notice them, which is how it should be.
B004QBNA8I|5|easy to install  Removed the door handle cover plate, nhooked the electronic lock harness, removed the door panel screws (3) and popped off the door panel and installed the handle in about 10 minutes.  Works and looks identical
B000BW9396|5|A+
B0027VNOZ8|5|awesome product easy install and 1/3 of the price as some of the competition
B0015CGSGC|5|Worked great on my Honda civic.
B00B2AU7QE|5|well pleased with price and product
B00KSXX3BC|5|Bulbs worK. Great price.
B006HZ9ENG|1|Loved the look and fit and performance. But the frames on these broke at the hinge with the tiniest amount of pressure after wearing them maybe five times. The hinge part itself is thin and brittle. For 50 bucks, I expected them to last a little longer and withstand a more reasonable amount of wear in a realistic environment of use. They are quite fragile, be very very careful if you buy these. I am disappointed in this product and after owning four pairs, won't be buying Suncloud anymore.
B0000AZ68V|5|Easy to install. Good quality. Works perfectly
B005C43YHU|5|this is also a great restorer for black rubber and plastic, just be careful and don't get it on painted surfaces, It does come off, but its not easy to get off
B009DQO8JG|5|Loved it
B002R0B9R4|1|Should have taken the advice of some of the comments on this product. Cannot get part to fit. Went to local salvage yard and traded the part for a used one that fit. Part was manufactured apparently without specs. Didn't contact seller, just bit the bullet on this one.
B00FLIB04Q|5|The dimensions of the decal are exactly as described. The materials used are top quality.<br /><br />The transfer of the decal went smoother than any other decal I've ever used. There were no bubbles to push out or anything.<br /><br />Often on a design like this one the transfer of the decal gets messed up because of the small lines and details. The thin vinyl lines can get pulled off of the surface you want it on when you remove the backing. This one let the backing pull off perfectly without any problems.<br /><br />Also, the white decal looks awesome on a tinted window. Walter White's face shows up white like it's supposed to and his hat, glasses, and beard look perfect with the black background.
B00348KSMK|5|This is a really good quality sticker i put mine on the outside of my car and it has gotten rained on etc...its still perfect. the colors are vibrant and the pictures are clear and detailed.
B001Q4XIHG|2|the rubber band are weak and break very easy.  cheap hardware to install.  they do hold the rifle tight once in place but i would not recommend these mostly because of where the rubber bands hook onto mount.  it is a real pain in the butt.  do yourself a favor and pass on these.
B0085KGOIE|3|Extremely heavy when full.  Wheel was broke when arrived. Very cheap. About 20 dollars worth of plastic
B001EGT3I4|5|Got product brand new in box just like stated.
B005JZD6KM|1|We measured, and measured again.  Right size.  Base went into the seat belt, no problem but when the car seat belt clicked in the extender, it wouldn't hold,.  I have a Toyota and had to purchase directly from toyota.  My daughter had the same problem of the belt not holding in the extender and she has Buick.  Same problem for both.
B00464B3UW|2|It works fine as a normal wiper. The silicone got detached from the metal every once in a while and the silicon hangs from the metal and makes squeaky noises. Its not a big problem since its easy to fix, its just it got annoying after a while. Other than that, everything worked just fine.(I've had the blades for 6 months now. used them both in dry weather with windshield fluid and under the rain)
B004AGAWV2|4|An exact fit with identical venting. Good looking, the silver finish keeps them from rusting - unlike typical uncoated cast iron disks. The finish wears off the disk faces right away but that is not an issue - they are self-cleaning... Made in China - ah well... . Well-balanced and so far (for the first 1500 miles) they are warp-free, smooth, trouble free, quiet.
B004G7OHFC|5|The weight makes gearchanges positive and effortless. Really made my driving more enjoyable and fun now. I can shift faster and with full confidence the gear will be selected.....
B001P11SCM|5|Love the improvements from the last  model. This one is easier to adjust to match trailer braking.I replaced it after 7 years of use,before it failed,probably lasted closer to 6 years.GREAT product,I like the price too!<br /><br />2007 Dodge Ram3500 Mega Cab 6.7turbo diesel w/ companion 38' Jayco Designer 5th wheel.
B003YCZ1F0|4|Nothing wrong with this purchase.  Received on time, mounted on my new BMW System 6 EVO helmet using the sticky back attachment and I use it every day.  If I had an issue it would be with the functioning of the blue tooth SENA transmitting unit.  It doesn't always synch up to where I can use the voice commands but I think the issue is probably more with the Samsung Galaxy Note voice actuation process and my lack of understanding than the SENA.  None-the-less I really don't have a problem with using the device.
B008KPTDGE|5|I bought it for my sister as a gag gift because she is obsessed with her boyfriend and she ended really loving it.
B005CHFD62|3|I was hoping the material was made up of something better but it works just as good and looks as good.
B000HEBR3I|3|Works well, but the hose is short and you have to place your gas can withing 18&#34; of the device you are filling.
B000BYGFGI|5|Delivered on time. Better quality than the originals. Been 2 or 3 months and no problems. Be sure to replace them one at a time comparing lengths and taking note of position on distributor cap.
B007IVS93Y|5|They are just what you see in the picture and work like they should.
B000RXNLK6|1|It's good, but i receive this bottle with a hole sooo imagine what i saw when i open the box :(
B00GHS6CTM|4|Fit and does what it's supposed to.
B000YAL0HI|5|Cool
B003FO2O1G|2|It didn't work for me. I tried it on my camper but it just didn't pull in the channels. It was very easy to install.
B0077FK0SS|5|OEM Replacement , fit perfect but seemed a little softer than it should have been...all in all good product , good purchase
B004B1ACRU|5|I had a frame with a single row of clear rhinestones and wanted a change. This one is heavy and really pretty. Seems to be sturdy and also nice because I think it'll work fine with not covering up my state name when I can put my license plate and the frame on (its illegal in my state). I think it should be cheaper though but otherwise I am happy!
B00BCR609K|4|Breat buy for the price!
B001G7MZTU|5|And then I bought the replacement from Amazon. AN exact replica, made of metal. No plastic. Nothing cheap about this product, and easy to install. Recommended.
B00153BEA6|5|The only complaint I have about this unit is that its manual is a bit sparse and it sucks more juice than I would prefer.  Yet for the price, I give it a 5 star rating.  Instead of spending $3000 on an inverter, I can always stick up a $500 panel to cover the power loss.
B00DYAF9FY|5|Great price, no odor, works great!<br /><br />Update 10/15/2015: I just received 35 sq ft of Noico for the same price. Compared to Stinger Pro and Noico: Fatmat Rattletrap is lighter, not as dense. Noico is 3 times heavier per sheet.
B00C1ZRKLY|5|very good
B00QK0ALVM|5|VERY GOOD EASY INSTALLATION AND GREAT PRICE!
B009PJJDX2|5|works
B000R4PFFO|5|wo4rks very well
B001GJ9K8C|3|good give away.  Adams much better
B00KHS18RY|5|Nice quality and nice and bright. Came two with 2 stickers. Would order again if I had too
B0010E3IW2|5|I bought a used GX470 and drove it for a year without realizing there was a cabin filter. When I replaced it, there was a TON of dust and even leaves from trees that don't live near where I'm from or have been, so who knows how long it had been in there.<br /><br />The first blast of AC came with a cloud of dust and the not-quite-fresh smell I'd become used to. Then after about 5 seconds, no dust and no smell at all. I've now driven the vehicle for a month or so and I'm still amazed how fresh the car smells even when I'm stuck in stop and go traffic.<br /><br />I will now change the air filter as religiously as I do the fluids and grease on the drive shafts.
B0006MQJ0M|4|I didn't take everything out.  But jumper cables seem a decent quality.  Everything else is in a ziploc bag.  So I'd leave the batteries uninstalled until needed.  Good little item for the price.
B00029WZ0C|5|I got K&N RC-4630 for my Honda Accord V6 2008 and I love It. More power and better engin performance.
B00AN8LY2M|1|its not the right one
B0002Q7ZQE|5|Easy to install, took about 10 minutes.
B004ALBUYU|5|As experienced by other users of the FiOS service, my FiOS battery back-up system started beeping a while ago.  This battery is a great drop-in replacement for a reasonable price.  One note.  The terminals on this battery are slightly narrower than the OEM battery.  The connectors will still fit fine, however.
B000GVPEYU|4|I got this pump to replace the tiny stock pump that came with my kit. It is certainly louder, but not overpowering. I found that in winter, mainly temps below 20 degrees, the output isnt much but that was the case with stock one as well. The pressure may be higher but the flow is still a little underwhelming. Get an onboard air system if you want huge sound.
B002OMY5N0|5|These fit my Nighthawk perfectly. I used these tubes with a homemade manometer to sync my own carbs very inexpensively.
B0033YJPQU|1|i purchased this regulator for my 2008 f150.  It worked great for about 3 weeks.  then i heard a grinding noise and the window froze about halfway up.  very uphappy since its an hours job to remove and replace it.
B001ECPX0U|5|Easy to install. The only difficulty I had on my 2005 Ford Focus was the brake lines didn't want to seat properly in the retaining clips the way they did on the OEM struts. It wasn't really much of a problem... just a little bending, and they went in. The ride and handling is great now. I had never changed struts before, and these quick-struts seem to be the way to go if you don't mind spending a little extra money to not have to worry about spring compressors and all that hassle.
B006X8CSVM|5|was so easy to install. only took 5 minutes. and it looks great
B003PERH9K|5|It is very cute and just the right size for the back window of my small SUV.  I have received several favorable comments from people.
B002R0QZFK|5|This is a really nice replacement for the turn signal on my 98 Tacoma.  Removing the old socket was a bit of a chore, but the new one snapped in very easily.  I like that it even came with a new bulb.<br /><br />The amber color is slightly different from my other (eighteen year-old) signal, but it's close enough.  It's a lot brighter than the other one, too,  as the lens isn't corroded or scratched, and the mirror finish inside is pristine.<br /><br />I'm glad I made the switch.  At the prices, I think I will replace the rest of my light fixtures, too.
B000CRER3C|5|great part very nice quality
B003FPF22I|5|Theses Bulbs are extremely cheep compared to the HID's that claim to do the same that theses do, but they do it better, cheaper, SO MUCH EASIER.<br />If you can change a bulb, you can have blue HID lights with out the over 300 dollar kit and the 2 hours required to get the same quality that theses 20 dollar bulbs and less than 10 minutes gives you.
B000C560ZM|5|quality hardware for a great price. does what it's supposed to.  installed easily. nice improvement in turning on my 02 odyssey
B0035NZNQ0|5|Nice looking simple upgrade for the Tacoma. Although the instructions state that you don't have to cut the factory grill out to use this, it is extremely difficult to mount this with the factory grill in. There are several mounting tabs that require you to drill a small hole then put a screw in. I ended up cutting out the entire factory center grill section and smoothing out the trimmed plastic. The grill is see through so you'll want to relocate your horns and paint the section behind black to get a better look. But it looks great overall. Great addition to any Tacoma.
B004488XCG|5|This is a great addition to any Jeep owner!! It is a great quality tag with nice color and looks great on our jeep!!
B006YTP704|5|Flushed my transmission and filled it with this. I have a 2000 Honda Civic automatic sedan. Works perfectly. Good stuff.
B0068C2Y9E|5|Perfect got here on time
B00CM770BQ|1|cant get filters for it that are made for it, seems you have to modify stock ones.
B00FSCBAMW|5|Good product for a very low price.
B00BTGDR9A|1|The orange and yellow pads fell apart after first use.  Surprisingly others colours were ok.<br /><br />After having this problem, I looked again at the products reviews and noticed it happened to other people also.<br /><br />It's good that u can buy a set of foam pads, but your set might not be a set for long !
B002ZI7V4I|5|These are the small versions of the big ROK straps which I absolutely love and highly recommend. I got these to use on my motorcycle top box because the attachment holes on the box are small. Just finished touring with much off-road too. These straps held my sleeping mattress, my tent, a tarp roll, and hiking sandals to the top of my bike trunk on VERY rough terrain and never came loose. Highly recommended!
B00FJF0O2K|5|Absolutely brilliant, saved loads of time and economical too.  Complete checkered roof and some decal on the doors, removed the lot in less than 2 hours.
B0055XHBHC|5|It was for our camper. My husband says it is more comfortable than the one we have at home. would buy again.
B000PSJMWY|5|Easy installation. Great product.
B000R3WQPM|5|Perfect fit for a JK, absolutely no issues. It even stays up without the sun shades down.
B00MR250NG|5|Awesome decal for the price .. Looks good ..
B0042ZS8P8|5|Works great. No problems here.
B009HSP3K8|5|Got this to install a trailer lite hookup for the CRV..simple plug in that works. Easy to install and the hookup was easy.  Plug and light. Good product and fast delivery
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works well!
B004TDMX9A|4|Perfect fit
B00266YNUE|5|I've had no problems it fit great and seems strong like the original easy install if you handle it with care it'll last a good while
B00B26JDY0|1|It's already changing colors and rusting
B006RIX3I0|5|Very good product thank you.
B00B3V2LSY|3|The color is more orange/pink then it is red.  I still have 4 full cans I dint know what to do with
B003TU662Y|4|My shower tile has never been cleaner...how gratifying. you know all that crap you spray on grout, wait 15 minutes and...nothing? Forget that...horsepower baby! I look forward to using this thing every time.
B000BZDTH0|1|i dont really need this sensor but i was decide change all temperature sensor, when i was checking this, i noticed an rare thing, socket was turning about body, installed it dosnt keep the water, all fluid lick for turning zone. i should put the old, wasted money
B005NELVOM|5|Bright blue. Compliments all the time
B009T8M9SU|5|Perfect!!
B00752TRNW|5|Have in my 93 honda that sits for a clp of days at a time. Between my working trips. Keeps a good charge of solar panel
B000CAY068|2|I bought this part to replace the OEM cylinder on my Toyota Tacoma.  The original parts lasted for 15 years.  My hope was that the Beck Arnley parts would be a better replacement then what was available at my local auto parts store.  So, I paid 3 times as much as a replacement set would have cost at AutoZone.  The warranty was for 1 year.  The parts wore out in 1 year, 8 months.  For longevity like that, you'd be better off buying the cheap stuff at AZ or O'Reillys!  It seems that you can either pay for genuine Toyota parts, or change parts every few years.
B004I0HFQK|5|fit perfect 2005 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9 2WD quad cab. 10 minutes to install and brakes and lights work great. Saved a ton of money over the dealership
B000IYK79C|5|Perfect fit, no issues to install! It's a little piece that fits exactly in my fan motor replacement for my 98 Grand Cherokee!
B00T0X1X1I|5|Great Customer service and good quality.
B00GZ74A7Q|4|the reason i gave the hid lights a four is that when i first got the kit, one of the ballast wasn,t working. got on the phone told them about my problem they took care of it. had a replacement in 2 days. other than that the product is what the company said it is. lights are very bright inside a closed garage with the lights off. will update when i get to use them at night. Thanks for a good product at a great price! yes i will recommend the sdx hid lights to all of my friends and family! UPDATE!! Had a chance to use them at night. turn the night into daylight. love them!
B000A8FNWC|5|A quality made wheel lock. Instruction on how to get an extra key for the wheels locks. Tightens well and is an easy install.
B001TICRRQ|2|I bought the jack named Trailer Star tongue jack not from Amazon but from an online retailer. After 6 months it started to make grinding noises, one light out, and noticed all the exposed screws rusting. My trailer is stored outside. Took the thing apart and found rust and water inside the gear case. They used a dab of grease here and there. All the gears were rusting. The ball bearings and plate they set on had no grease and rusting. I took all the parts and coated them with water resistant grease. The lights were rusted in and now worthless. The jack works good after greasing all the moving parts. Assembled with cheep parts and poor design of gear case. I replaced all the screws with stainless steel screws.
B0036G97RM|5|Super comfortable, looks great b
B0009VD174|2|It didn't fit my vehicle even though it was specific to my vehicle.<br />Sent it back since it didn't fit<br />But I was still very happy with the service I received
B001PYG9H8|5|I was reversing out of my driveway when my clutch pedal sticks to the floor and doesn't return. Google the symptoms and was told i need a new slave cylinder. Item came quick and in perfect condition. When installing make sure to grease the plastic tip and be absolutely positive you are lined up with the clutch fork or you will over extend the rod and blow the seals on your new slave cylinder.
B004BYX8W8|5|Before you replace your starter, battery, or a dozen other things because your Jeep will not start, this is should be a prime suspect for you to look into.  Common symptoms: accessories turn on but engine will not turn over and starter makes no noise whatsoever.  This cheap piece of plastic turns the ignition switch (which provides power from the battery to the starter) when you turn the key.  It is basically an overly complicated extension Chrysler has designed to fail.  Luckily, the stealership missed out on a few hundred dollars and it only took me about an hour to replace this mechanism (and a few days of waiting on shipping while starting my car with a screwdriver).  It comes with detailed instructions that make replacement a snap.  Do not skip steps however mundane they seem - it hurts later.
B007ZDJ1W8|4|They look good on my 89 gmc but had to modify a few things to make them fit but good lookin for the price though
B002DVGVIY|3|So this sticker is not so much a decal as it is contact paper. The backing it comes on is the same backing as contact paper. It is stickier than contact paper for sure, but it is not vinyl decal. Vinyl decals are not super sticky, they are clingy, this sticker is sticky and little more permanent than a decal. I was disappointed in this as I didn't want an actual sticker on my car.  The stickiness aside, it is a good quality sticker. It looks just like the picture and is fairly easy to apply. If you are okay with a sticker instead of a decal then I would recommend this for X-Files fans.
B001O2T43M|5|tools work prefect i took the ipod apart in minutes and without a problem the screw drivers are the exact fit for the ipod
B00265M9SS|1|This thing is made of plastic and looks like it will break after the first use. I sent ti back right away and got one at harbor freight made of metal for twenty bucks.
B000BR3BEY|5|Filter did give more power but is yet to be seen about better mileage. Also like that it is re-useable.
B000IYLK02|1|Q: well this fit in my Mitsubishi Eclipse GS 2003?
B0007IKG1I|1|The forks are made of pot metal.  The large fork broke on second use. This product is a waist of money.
B00O9G8V7K|4|This guard is very similar if not the same as deezee DZ500825. I installed it on a 2014 FJ cruiser. The only problem was that the mount brackets were stamped incorrectly by the manufacturer. Drivers side was passenger and vice versa. It was after reading the following review, that I discovered the issue, after contacting the seller.  http://www.amazon.com/review/R34M1SE4ZXYIAM/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001OCVC2S&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=15684181&store=automotive  With that exception, the installation went well, and it looks like it may offer some protection.
B008FOJW5C|5|Perfect for my new 2014 XV Crosstrek.  OEM mats and almost $20 cheaper than the dealer!  A great alternative to Weathertechs.
B00D8RYGOI|5|I want to say this is an awesome light great equipment!! I ordered another one for the other side of my boat!!
B0046ID5EK|2|Alarm button is slightly higher then others and I accidentally hit it quit often
B007V2BJ5K|5|Easy to install every time I park my car and the blue colour doesn't cast as much of a glare onto my neighbour's deck as the silver colour does.
B00EAPZERU|5|This mount is fantastic, VERY happy with my purchase.  Many options, all the bits needed... ready to go.  If this won't get your gauge mounted... it's probably not going to happen.
B000JZZREU|5|easy breezy
B002US3ZE8|5|Heavy duty bench seat nylon fabric cover that resists Pet hair.  Easy to put on and take off and throw in the washing machine.  The cover does not have a foam backing that will break apart in washing machines.  Definitely a good value considering its price with the competition that offer a sub-standard product !
B004LYR4FK|1|Not wide enough range to pick up movement
B00N4YOYIS|5|I can not attest to how they last but they are build very well. Have a large heat sink tucked in behind the housing and put out tons of light. I am very please with the two I originally ordered so I ordered 10 more. Using in a field construction trailer so our parts section needs lots of light. You can put them on a dimmer as well.
B000CJ4XRK|4|Works just fine on my 2006 Jeep Liberty.  Pay attention when installing this as unlike the OEM one, this can be installed backwards.
B006L7Q5CS|5|Love the license plate stands out . Only tough part was your license plate has 4 screwe holes and the plate frame had only two holes.,I was nervous the license plate was going to fall out. But in the end was fine.
B003I1YWPW|5|These mats look great and fit my 2012 Subaru Outback perfectly - even down to the grommets in the driver's front seat. I've posted photos and do recommend the mats. They aren't kidding about the lead time - ordered March 11 and received April 2nd - and that was earlier than expected - but well worth the wait. You won't be disappointed!
B009PP5IBM|1|Looks really cool. But the brake it's plastic and after 10 cuts it wears out easy and it will no longer holds the blade
B000UKDRY6|5|The tool worked great. The picture above is not correct. It is not a picture of the impeller tool listed.
B0010DW630|5|This product fits a 2007 volkswagen rabbit with no issues. I would recommend this as an alternative to higher-priced OEM filters.
B00BENM8DO|4|I must have misread the description - I wanted a cover to protect my car from elements -- something thicker. This is a dust cover, thinner material and while that is nothing to gripe about, it still does not keep rain and water off the car and I doubt it would be a lot of protection from hail (which we had a couple years ago). I have an older car that is longer than newer models. Although I measured and was assured this cover would fit my Olds 98, it didn't. It was shy a couple of inches.<br /><br />With that said, as long as you understand the description, I have to say that it is a great cover. The price was great; it was packaged really good (even comes with a storage bag) and it is great as a dust cover. If it rains though, the moisture will leak through and leave a mess on the car if it hasn't been washed recently.
B000CO7IIQ|3|all good
B00DU4TOWS|4|these were awesome , just the right size for what i needed and fast service!!!!
B000QC6H90|5|Used it on the rails of my SUP boards. I need more.
B002OR4242|5|I purchased this Converter/Charger to replace my stock single stage charger. Here's my video review and DIY installation (http://bit.ly/1BSqUgh). The installation guide includes step-by-step instructions for each stock make/model that it replaces. Simply find the page in instructions specific to your stock charger. The multi-stage charger works as advertised and is a worthwhile upgrade for any RV or trailer with single stage stock chargers. Your batteries will charge faster and last longer with one of these.
B000C5A1T8|2|Shipped in a timely fashion but none of the hardware that came with is was correct, and the bags of parts say rough country not moog, no where on the box does it say moog, so im think it might not actually be a moog part.
B002DU3TTO|5|Works as intended!  Very useful for almost any battery tender placement.
B00BQWQN3E|5|Brighter than the stock headlights but not 100% happy
B005VKLGUW|5|If you have a broken key purchase the shell and have the electronics transferred.  I'm so excited to have a key for my car.
B000WYYP14|5|I've had many firestick antennas and this one tuned perfectly. I've had reliability issues with firestick antennas but decided to buy another. So far, so good.
B000KITTYU|5|I love this tool! It was a lifesaver when replacing the tie rods on my old jeep. Definitely a good purchase.
B005C2ACBI|4|Easy to use. Very secure.
B000CJ04AK|5|Right now they are a 5 star solution.  Have about 65K on the vehicle and was having some misfires and stutter.  Swapped them out, they came pregapped from the factory and worked well.  Immediate response, no more stuttering and power has been restored.  Certainly will not know if they will last as long as advertised and 7 years seems unlikely.  Hope to get upto 100K on them.<br /><br />Just wished Mazda had not opted to put the intercooler right on top of the plugs, made a simple job so much more compicated.
B007ZDMGZ2|1|Received this and had an issue with one of the bulbs which was very quickly resolved by the customer service people. Now I'm a happy customer!<br /><br />UPDATE Winter 2013/2014... So they worked great all summer.. but now one of the bulbs does not like to turn on when the temperature outside drops below freezing. Pain in a$$ because now I have to flick my lights on and off about 10 - 15 times before it decides to stay on. Def not happy anymore.. I guess you get what you pay for.
B003D4KA32|5|fit in to 2014 toyota camry le-it look's good and some exhaust note to it.
B002JOVUO0|5|Needed something to put back on a car emblem.  This stuff has done the trick.  Fantastic.  Not the cheapest, but works great.
B0027FYBNI|5|works well leaves a good sent and no residue
B00B3P26N0|4|I do not have a Jeep Wrangler, but this decal looks great on the back of my old Land Rover Discovery.<br /><br />I cut off the lettering to make the whole thing a little more subtle. I personally find this to be addition by subtraction. I only wish that the &#34;picture&#34; portion were a little larger. You kind of have to get close to see what's implied here. The only reason this receives four (4) stars.<br /><br />I am stationed at a major command out in Hawaii, and I swear that these stick figure families are overrepresented by senior military officers. I think that they are trying to show their colleagues how committed they are to the nuclear family. As a young single Lieutenant, I felt it was my duty to plaster this on the back of Sir Elton (That is what I call my Disco). I like to think that former bro's give a silent fist pump when they see this, wishing they could truly express themselves.
B0032DHFZK|5|I love them and they work good and I would buy them again and I would tell family and friends about them
B004XNQLB2|5|You get what you pay for. Pricey but works better than other tapes for vinyl, also used on inflatable water slide with great success
B00SOIL6U8|5|Easy to install. Quick delivery.
B000CLIKO0|2|FIT GREAT!
B00IZNVSQ4|5|made changing valve springs so much easier
B001DCIPHY|5|This is the EGR valve for a Nissan 720 pickup.  May fit others.  It was nice to find a new one at a reasonable price.  None of the local chain auto parts stores had one.
B005COIJP2|1|Terrible product.Took the time to make the wiring(which has to be the cheapest wire ever made) and light install to look good. The lights barely light up and don't work 1/2 of the time. I am extremely disappointed and will now have to get a good replacement set of lights. My old,rusted,broken lights were better than these.. DO NOT BUY THESE!
B007USCMJM|3|it said in the description that it came with a hose and everything and i only got the can, im not to happy
B000PGXQNC|5|Always keep a spare for your RV cord.  Easy installation and strong.  RV plug replacement is a whole lot cheaper than buying the new cord.
B00HW58R92|4|The poor engrish instructions that came with these were priceless.
B000BGJWA2|5|fixed the old broken one!  nice
B000BK3XIU|4|These $10 gloves kept my hands warm in Skagway Alaska, and didn't turn me into a Republican.
B000BJLOYQ|5|Stop searching for the perfect microfiber/drying towels. These are it. They work so well... they are amazing. I keep a moist one in my car for touch ups after driving my car after a wash. They soak up a lot of water and are also safe for paint... what else can you ask for?
B00G1RKS6C|5|Love it!
B00150P0O0|5|Have been ordering these off ebay for years. Love the smell !!! One of the best smelling air fresheners I have ever came in contact with. Even better price here on Amazon only complaint is they aren't available on prime.
B001TYJOG2|5|DESCRIPTION<br /><br />These seat covers are very well made, even a dealership employee said so. The material feels strong and durable, the stitching also appears durable.<br /><br />The middle colored sections are two layers of fabric with varying sized-stitching, designed to allow the seats to \\"breath\\" and also whisk away moisture from the people sitting on them.<br /><br />They're \\"not too slick\\" but not too difficult to scoot across either.<br /><br />The front covers are designed to work on newer vehicles with airbags that deploy from inside the seat, a lightly stitched opening designed to break apart when those airbags deploy.<br /><br />The rear seat cover has 3 zippers in the middle area, all 3 can be completely separated on both the back and seat sections of the cover. One is right down the middle, the other 2 are equal distances from the center, and pretty dang close to where our Corolla's 60/40 split is.<br /><br />These will only work with car seats that have removable head rests for both the front and back seats (5 headrest covers included). I was able to install mine to look decent by messing with each one for a little while, my covers were installed in a 2010 Toyota Corolla SE.<br /><br />For seat cover installations, you will have to remove the headrests FIRST, and you will likely have to make 4 or 6 cuts through the rear seat covers to allow the headrest posts to poke through. Rear seat belt buckles may require a cut to fit correctly as well. Just try to make these cuts no bigger than needed to push the posts and/or buckles through.<br /><br />In the '10 Corolla, with 8 snips (6 headrest posts, 2 belt buckles), it fits nicely, though the darker gray isn't the best match for the light-gray interior. Our rear window seat headrests don't line up with the colored part of the covers, but take the time to get it centered and getting creative with securing the rear upper seat cover, it still looks great when it's done.<br /><br />So I'm really satisfied with my purchase, these covers exceeded my expectations!<br /><br />INSTALLATION TIPS:<br /><br />* When installing the front seat covers, make sure the tags and modifications for the seat air bags are installed on the side of the seat your manufacturer says that airbag would deploy on your vehicle.<br /><br />* Front seat covers may need a little \\"tucking\\" under plastic parts at the seats base to fit and look the best. Also, for the top of the front seat covers, there's a velcro opening that can be adjusted around the headrest posts.<br /><br />* Back seat is 2 pieces, the upper only has the mesh fabric on the sides, make sure goes down. The lower part has the mesh fabric on 3 sides, the side without the mesh get's tucked into the corner with the bottom of the upper seat cover.<br /><br />* On the '10 Corolla, I found that the middle of the bottom of the headrests weren't exactly sewn shut, appears intentional, and is the perfect location to tuck the excess fabric of the headrest cover up into, further improving it's fit.<br /><br />* There are a bunch of hooks in a baggie inside the packaging to use with the elastic loops on the seat covers, I can't really help here, and prepare yourself for some twisting and turning throughout installation for best fit, and again, it's still worth it.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />* My main complaint is having to cut into the fabric, I hesitated before making the first cut. Take your time, get the alignment *perfect* before making that first cut. The fabric doesn't seem to unravel too much, and the headrests themselves hide the new slits, so I feel confident that there won't be tearing over time because of it.<br /><br />* Other than that, the only other negative is how much time it takes to get these seat covers installed perfectly, and I strongly recommend you taking your time. Make sure the seats are clean like you're removing crime scene evidence clean prior to installing the seat covers to make sure your seats won't get damaged because of trapped dirt and debris, and get the longest life out of the covers.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />If you're looking for a high quality, full-set seat covers set that doesn't cost 3 digits like the custom-fit covers do, this set might just be for you. I am highly satisfied and will definitely consider this item/brand in the future. Hope you're reading this during a sale. :)set seat covers set that doesn't cost 3 digits like the custom-fit covers do, this set might just be for you.

B0009V1WXE|5|Like the plastic holder,hoors are plastic coated,
B004AHCROG|5|good
B00D42AFS8|5|Incredible size. My issue with older Car Jump batteries was weight and size. Not the case with PBJS 12000R. It weights almost nothing and can fit on the plum of your hand. I also rely on it as back up power source for my portable electronic devices.
B009XZW0CY|5|Very cute! Fit nicely.
B001NKI49K|1|I am not satisfied with the product given that I get the wrong size, but the selected product is not of the size requested.<br />although the order revece transfer and I do not see where you specify the size thank revise this to avoid future problems is really disappointing.<br /><br />I mailed me a full report of the order and request to see where the errors were.
B00FS0WFAA|5|I thought I would never be able to get my seat covers back on, after taking them apart to clean them. These hog ring pliers are good quality and make it easy to get everything back together. You can barely tell I took them off.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Great extension cord if you need it. Only improvement I can think of is having an end cap so that dirty does not get in.
B00CX7NF8C|5|This key cover is a great idea for cars with an incorporated key / remote opening system.  It protects the key from damage if dropped, and makes the key much easier to hold onto.  One Honda dealer charges less for this than Amazon, but most Honda dealers charge equal or more, so I feel the Amazon price was good.  Worth it anyway, and the variety of colors allows you to match the car, and/or designate keys, etc.  A great idea.
B002P8OXDK|3|the mirror images is not the same as the factory/original.  it's seems like 10x magnifies then the origanl but it does work.  it fits onto our truck.  thank you
B000A8MOF6|4|I purchased these tape on visors because I could not find in-channel one's! I prefer the look of in-channel visors over tape on. These fit well and look okay, however, the main benefit is being able to leave the windows cracked open to vent the vehicle! Lifetime warranty makes my purchase easier. Time will tell if tape stays on. I would recommend this product to others!
B0024GJ4IM|1|Stopped working after the 30 days.  Contacted the manufacturer, and could not get any response.  Could have been unlucky with a bad unit, but I could never get anyone to return my phone calls or emails.
B006BQL4DY|3|What they don't warn you about when advertising this product is that you basically have to be trained by a manufacturer's representative on how to use it and you better be wearing full fireman's gear, and you better be really careful when using it or it could maim or kill you.
B0087QXWRM|5|Great looking grips.  They look good on my Sportster and fit perfectly.
B000BK767Y|5|it suits my needs very well. I ware it everyday almost. I like the pockets inside the vest as well.
B000R8SLWY|3|After trying to find a spot to mount, not on roof, I finally had it working with stock horns. Seems the stock horns are just as loud.
B002LGE6LK|5|Changing the clutch was quick and easy. I should have bought the tool to hold the basket so I could have torqued the center nut but used an electric impact instead and best guessed on the feel. All is well now, no slip even using an automotive oil so I coul be happier. We'll see on longevity.
B00AB35BSM|5|Great product. Don't forget to get a case with your investment. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000P3WPKK
B00348KSMK|5|Very nice, very detailed, very colorful.  I like it a lot.
B000TTQ2HM|5|Great product
B003U1NPBW|5|They are so cute, I shared them with my children, going to buy more. My kids loved them, can not go wrong with the price.
B00EDFM6R8|5|Definitely try flipping the light if it does not work the first way you put it in does not work. They work well and are close to the original bulbs color. It is re-assuring that the battery for my Coachmen Clipper 16FB will last a little longer with less power draw due to the lighting. I needed 7 total, so I have a few spares I guess (2 in bathroom, 2 in dining area, 2 in bed area, 1 over sink).
B0029XJVA6|4|These work great at cleaning windows.  One thing I noticed was the plastic was a little weak and broke on one of them I ordered.
B009TOCOUW|5|I bought these for my son...He says they are the best gloves he's ever had...think I may buy me a pair...I'm a school bus driver and my hands freeze on the cold steeling wheel..wonder if they make socks....
B00GTGKL1C|5|Good replacement.  Came with old 17mm recessed hex bolt instead of the newer style hex head bolt.  So this kit matched what the car came with from the factory.
B00MYD635C|5|exactly as listed
B000GU3Q6O|5|Very well made. Attaches to bike securely and offers several options to ensure it doesn't move. I like this bag a lot for a low profile way to carry a few things. It's perfect for a sweatshirt, rain gear, and a few small things. I even fit a half helmet in there, but barely. . But if I was to do it again I would get the next size up. That doesn't take anything from the bag, Be sure to read the dimensions. They're listed a couple different ways on the site. That was confusing. The smaller dimensions are the ones from the manufacturer.
B0068FXJWC|5|Better than expected.
B007CX6IBI|4|my wife likes them
B00BZGW3AS|5|A helpful addition.  Keeps cargo unseen from outside.  Appears to have always been there.
B000HBM6RW|5|I really like this soap, it's like Lava without the sandpaper feel and much better at cleaning.  It doesn't remove everything that the liquid Fast Orange does but if you like a bar soap, as I do, it is great. Your hands feel good afterward too, it rinses off easily. My only complaint is that it is hard to find in stores.
B008A7U13G|5|Thanks ..nice!
B002P8DFXO|4|This item fit well and looked pretty good for an inexpensive replacement. Only complaint is that the mirror shakes more than the stock one does on the opposite side (mostly only at 50+ mph).
B004M2RIJI|4|I cannot believe how clear the head sets are when talking to another person. I would recommend this set highly. It was a great investment.
B0044UPO5S|5|They are GORGEOUS!! I couldn't be happier with my decision. There are so many options for setup and they make my car look like a BEAST coming down the road!
B006V3XNE0|5|Seems to be a high quality sticker. I hope it lasts longer than the previous one.
B00HDBSEES|5|these are great! i had purchased a different type and they just did not work out. they would not stay on. these stay on. i really liked the fact that you could adjust the tension\grip. i was worried because of my past experience, but quickly realized these were a much better design. they look good and work really well.
B008Y1OUAI|5|Very pleased with purchase
B000E7YP7I|5|In my search for the perfect trunk organizer, I checked out several different brands and styles, but Rola is really the only choice for a quality organizer which will last forever and functions well.  All of the others I tried were either flimsy and cheaply constructed, or just not the right size.  Rola offers several sizes for different needs....check them out!!
B0077S1BBU|4|works fine.  Just be aware that the side plate breaks easily when you pop it off to install the push knob.  Save yourself some time and money and order the kit that contains the side plate, too.
B001TK7CYM|5|Nicnice
B00J4ZE0WG|5|it work rill good thank
B0013REXWU|4|These are a great addition to our jeep it completely changed the looks for the better and since I have wider tires it keeps the tires from rubbing.
B00ISLA1WA|5|Had to cut the back end to clear bumper, but works fine.
B008P4T27A|4|Made in the USA say's a lot these days. Great product, gaskets and mount hardware was appreciated and basically needed to accomplish the Job.
B003E1CR30|5|I installed this in a 2004 ford explorer, I saw a video on U-Tube and followed those instructions, My install was a simple &#34;plug and go&#34; as the vehicle has factory installed trailer/towing  package. there are three stages of brake pressure, I use the first stage, my trailer being 1700 lbs. When I pull to a stop I find it better not to ride the brakes as I get a surging when I get almost stopped, Now I just drive up and stop. the brakes/trailer braking system make this vehicle stop better than with the trailer attached than without the trailer attached. The instructions for installation are pretty basic once you have your wiring set up. took me less than 30 minutes to run the adaptor wire over the console to the unit that I installed just above the gas pedal.
B0012TYNY2|5|just the right size perfect
B009D1HFFU|5|I will not ride without a TPMS and the TireGard works great.  I use it on a Goldwing and it is a great way to monitor tire temperatures and pressures.  This version is not waterproof, but I've gone hours in the rain without the silicone cover and not had any issues.  Gives me lots of peace of mind.  One last thing, I prefer this model over the pocket/key chain version because it can tolerate cold weather.  I have forgotten the pocket version on the bike in the garage, and with freezing temperatures had the the display crack.
B000IXR7DM|3|If you like purple then by all means get this key chain because it is really cool. But if you are expecting pink then keep looking. It's definitely lilac. Was hoping for bubble gum pink and was very disappointed.
B007RW191S|5|It fit perfectly was great replacement for rusted old part. Thanks Greatly
B00BCQ9VUG|4|I like the size and easy use of this tool. I gave one to my daughter to keep in her car.
B00KTIVFTS|1|The programming procedure appeared to go well, as both were able to function, but immediately after the procedure was complete, neither worked properly. It took several key presses before anything would respond, and it was very intermittent. The old remote only had a broken case, so I just transferred the circuit board into the new case. Other than the actual board, the insides are identical, so it was an easy swap.
B00FBKSW54|5|These headlights are just plain awesome. Very bright, easy to install, and a huge improvement over the factory headlight bulbs that come with any car.
B005C5EJJ6|4|Look sharp on  the machine.  Fitment was not perfect.
B0006VORDY|5|Wow..!! You need to cook outdoors this burner is awesome!
B007PP2FWY|3|Couldn't use for intended purpose, but saving for future use.
B000JFL7ZS|5|This works well on my 1999 BMW 323is. It saves me money to do my oil change by myself. I'm happy with my purchased from Amazon.
B00QRHDIPY|5|Simply brilliant I'll never have a dead boat battery again
B000GTWVRU|5|This pad is great and looks great. As with other reviews, I also would have liked a stronger magnet as it has too much play when first placing on the tank. Instructions specifically saw to warm up the pad prior to slapping onto the gas tank. California sun was generous enough to roast the pad onto the tank and it no longer moves around. it now does exactly as advertised and my tank is no longer being scratched by my belt or zipper.
B00BI4B7SG|5|No one can pass through my sons room without telling him this wall sticker is awesome. Very detailed and easy to stick on, but you need to take your time. I had zero problems placing it on by myself. Love it!
B000OAG2DK|5|Very good item, would buy again.
B009FG9IPS|5|Worked great. Had it installed professionally and got no problems
B003TLXWC0|5|Unfortunately the previous rating was a 3, even though there was no review of the product.  These work wonders, its really helpful keeping your battery going during those long winter months.  With HD batteries going for almost $180.00, this will save you a lot of money in the long run.  One of the easiest harley products to install.  It should take a person with little or no skill about 15 minutes max to install.   Connect the positive and negative onto the post of the battery, and get yourself a  zip tie to secure the wiring harness, and one to secure it in the location you want it to stay.
B003A1DTIG|4|This cap is of exceptional material and construction. Great fit.
B0021IXSN0|5|Strong and work awesome. A little tall for 3 inches but it works fine
B001FAGK4O|5|Fit my 88 Wrangler well.<br />Quick & easy to install.<br />They look a lot better than the old shrunk up factory pull straps, and they're functional.
B0054DCG9G|5|I bought this skin for my helmet about 3 years ago since I changed bikes and wanted to match the colors without buying a new helmet. Needless to say, was a very inexpensive swap and have gotten many great comments. I use the helmet year round in NJ weather, so the summer isn't too bad with the visor down (not clicked all the way) and in the winter is perfect. The skin attaches to the padding of the helmet on the inside with velcro, so with a little adjustment it looks perfect. The visor is also an excellent addition since I can use it at night with no problems (my tinted visor was terrible after sunset!). I recently purchased a different design for a spare helmet, so will review that one when I get it.
B0040DX7EO|5|the mirror is extra big and allows you to view your blind spots....furthermore I think it just looks really cool and interesting as the size of it stands out
B00390X6EK|1|Tried all the suggestions here to get them to fit with no luck. Too tight and does not go all the way down so light leakage.  This is unacceptable for the price of such a part.  Stick with the OEM ones for $5 each and just replace them every 5 years...These are just too much a pain to work with and they really don't look good with polished finish on matte black dash pannel.
B009DQO8JG|2|Really hard to pick and not cut well
B000CO9BSQ|5|The U-Bend was of high quality Mandrel bent tubing. The gauge/thickness matched what I had on the header I was repairing. Excellent for use in either fabrication of new or repair of old headers.
B000COC67E|2|First, don't buy this for other than occasional home use.  If you are expecting shop quality it's not.<br />The bolts WILL loosen up.  Guaranteed.  Use locktite.  No lock washers are supplied.<br />It's very short if you are 6' tall.  Under 14&#34; when seated.  Find something 14&#34; tall and sit on it before buying one.<br />The foam is kind of pointless.  Very, very low density, not like a chair, like an air filter.  They should have just had it wood on top.  All the foam does is get in the way.<br />If you are going to use a shop chair a lot, skip this model.  Look for one that's taller, and has locking wheels (or no wheels) so you can step on it if necessary.  Do not stand on this one.
B00029JNCA|1|WARNING! The description on this product is incorrect.  This product is for 2\\" receivers only.  It can not be configured to fit a 1.25\\" receiver.
B003DNH4F0|1|Blows off the front of truck when windy :-( no hole for antenna. Would be better with a second string to tie front to back
B009XU8W6W|1|Nothing like what it was suppose to be. Legs were too long than my original one.
B0032YTMZK|3|i loved them but they were only good for two months. after that the brightness start losing. Right now.. it is so hard to see out there on the road. So I ordered another one but I ordered 6000k. I hope it would b better
B000HEBR3I|4|worked great
B000WJA5ZY|5|With this mounted on handlebar of my Harley puts the tablet right in center so it's really easy to see.
B00B0GC13C|5|Items were perfect.  I'd recommend this vendor to anyone looking for letters & numbers for their mailbox.  They have different fonts, different sizes and different colors (B & W). These are very hard to find locally.
B00PUWRQ2S|5|Just purchased this for a second time. High quality product, good packaging. Price is more than I wanted to pay, but soon forgotten due to the quality. We have one of these in each of our diesel pickups for camping excursions or travel that may be in remote locations where acquiring fuel can be less than predictable . Also bought the Jerry Can Holder seperately to use with an existing gasoline can for the generator fuel.
B002XL2HVO|5|I moved into a small apartment and the drawers are very narrow. It was difficult to find a silverware holder at any store that would fit into a drawer that is only about 8 inches wide. This worked perfectly for me.
B001FBGW0A|5|Great fit,just what i was looking for..Truck is proper level again.The old leaf springs had actually broken and were ready to be replaced.We had no idea until we started tear down.
B00HTOB0NG|4|Well, I had to install a wiring relay and with this relay I could only install one.  I'm not sure why but on the 2013 Dodge Dart the original headlight wiring is polarized.  When I first plugged one of these in I plugged it into the old wiring and the relay.  Well my HIDs wouldn't come on.  Not one to give up I got online and did some research.  That's when I learned the Dart was polarized.  I ended up having to plug  the headlight end of the canceller in backwards.  It'll go but it won't clip.  Hey that worked!  Well, the Dodge Dart is picky and needs both sides plugged into a warning canceller otherwise you get the headlight out warning.  Using the relay though will only allow you to plug in one of the warning cancellers.  I've discussed this with Kensun and they are going beyond what I think they should have to do to make me happy.<br />  I think the warning cancellers are great but I'd love it if they came with instructions for any type of common install there might be.  It took some time doing some research to figure out how to hook up just warning canceller with a wiring relay.
B005F1PHE8|5|Very nice quality even though a little hard to install! They were advertised for a 2009 and they fit very well.
B000NI69WM|4|It does everthing  I could ask of it. It keeps the product inside of it dry, clean and relatively safe. After all that is the reason you make it.
B002Z37ENQ|4|Would recommend to anyone! I bought this for my husbands birthday and he loved it! He was so excited! It arrived in a timely manner and is a good helmet and doesn't look half as goofey as some of the other ones.
B000VKRQ7Y|4|Excellent. Love it
B004U41Y02|5|When I ordered the CSA LAB-302 AirCloud mattress there were no reviews through amazon placed at the time.  I spent way too many hours looking for a mattress to use as a guest bed for visitors.  I needed something durable, with good support, and textured to hold the sheets in place and keep my guests from feeling like they were camping out on a cold vinyl mattress.  I love the internal motor and it inflates within a minute or two.  I love the large raised edges!  It reinforces the support throughout the bed and keeps you even even if I rolled all the way to the edge I can sleep comfortably without the bed lifting up on the other side.  My 2 year old can stand on the raised edge and it doesn't even dip down!
B004O6V05K|2|The stickers are fine and probably have some deterrent value, although they could be more imaginative as a \\"fake alarm\\" sticket.  The leg light keeps falling off as the heat in the car causes the adhesive to melt.  It keeps ending up on the floor.
B000A6Z9AU|1|wrong item
B002IVAK9U|5|Thank you very much.  Igot exactly what I was expecting.  The spare was well packaged and arrived just in time
B00CIB2PRA|5|I awhile to get but it shipped from Frankfurt so not really a big deal.<br />Went on with minimal fuss. Just be careful with some of the tiny bits. I used a flexible squeegee to press the small pieces in until it was all in place.
B007GR4588|2|Usually good
B00J73E87M|4|Had to rewire it to get it to wrk. Works great now thx.
B000ZZWNYG|4|works fine
B000C2ANQW|5|Perfect fit on my oil leaking 1st gen CRV, did not need to apply RTV at the corners as you would an OEM gasket. No leaks!<br />I trust other FelPro gaskets on my Jeeps as well.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Got it in 2 days with prime account.  Everything looks great.  It came with instruction how to program it.  It worked like a champ for the Nissan Frontier 2003.  Will buy from here again...
B001MK5G7E|5|Offers a great license plate illumination or for a utility lamp application. Light performs well in a marine environment and is highly recommended.
B00CX7XQ5E|1|Straps are too narrow to accommodate standard seat belts.  Materials are cheap and have a terrible chemical odor.  Will cost almost as much to return as the product cost me.
B001FE27AQ|5|My son says the part was perfect got here on time great thanks
B00H8Z2F8A|5|A fraction of what the original skew driver costs and very well made. Excellent product. A must for all pro audio installers. 1/4 drill driver ready.
B000C57ZPQ|5|Good product
B00RYM1HF4|5|Good size, great adhesive. very visible
B000WKFCT2|5|I ordered the wrong product and the seller let me return the bolts after I had the product for over a week.  They were very nice about it and the emails were between us were cordial, professional, and pleasant.  I also recieved the product prompltly.  It was packaged well and so that it could be opened without destoying the package for ease of return. The product appeared to be well made and able to perform the function they were designed for. I would definitely do business with them again.
B001P2X4EQ|5|works great.
B003WHM2G8|5|I bought this for my 16 year old hunting crazed Daughter. She LOVES it and it fit her steering wheel perfectly. Its well made and has a nice \\"cushion feel\\" to it. Overall....very happy!
B006O3CHUI|5|Great product fast shipping
B0009ETC6U|1|This chain would work well in the suburbs but did not serve well in Boston AT ALL. The U-lock is easily broken into and did not even require a key to be easily picked. My 2000 dollar moped was stolen because of the faulty locks this faulty lock Tri-Max provides. The thief even did me a favor and left the lock and the chain where my bike was. When I called to speak to the warrantee department, JAMES &#34;Jim&#34; SENTZ did not even have the common courtesy to tell me what exactly was covered on lock warrantees. Not surprising: Terrible lock-terrible service. Lock up your bikes with something better if it means something to you.
B000H149J0|5|\\"What's a keezer?\\" you ask?  It's a modified chest freezer that stores and dispenses your homemade beer.  By modifying the thermostat, the chest freezer stays at around 40-45F.  Since you're using a compressor meant for a freezer, the condensation inside is inevitable.      Enter the Eva-Dry!  I use 2 of these and they work FANTASTICALLY soaking up cups and cups of condensation inside my keezer.  When one turns pink, I pull it out and plug it in for 24 hours to dry it out.  Then it goes back inside the keezer.    I know they work because when I forget to replace one (leaving it plugged into the wall), I have a cup or so of water in the bottom in just a few days.    I've been using mine since Oct 08 (>1 year now) and they are still going strong - no apparent loss of moisture absorbing capacity yet!  That was my biggest concern, that they would last for a few months and then peter out.  So, I waited until not to write this review.    Couldn't be happier!
B005M223W4|5|perfect mirror. cheap and durable product. easy to apply. fits perfect. feels like better than the original. fast shipment.
B003VPCGJO|4|Bought mine on ebay. First time for a car part for me. Seller was transglobalauto 99.3% satisfaction rating. Same part # as amazon 15239247 but 39.99! Swapped them one by one in my 08 Yukon XL. With key on and in reverse, when I got to the bad one the system started working fine. Easy peezy. Bumper cover is easy to remove for access. Some screws in the fender liner and across back and a couple of bolts underneath and then just pops off.
B007GIYPB4|5|Item was packaged well and arrived quickly. Install was a breeze and fit was excellent for my crew cab Titan. I drove it on the freeway right after install and it was great! Only downside was it was missing the LED light that was promised as a free gift along with other goodies. I didn't really mind since the product itself surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />update 9/12/16:<br />so far it's still holding up well. the little caps on the bars that keep it sturdy when laid out came loose, but nothing superglue can't fix.  the stitches on the velcro on one corner have come off/ripped off (about an inch).  it still seem to hold fine though.
B00W1VHNKG|5|Great sizing! Great item!
B00BOS783O|1|Will they fit on a  a dodge charger..
B00062YABC|5|Transmission Kickdown stud.<br />Good Product and good fitment.<br />Great price on a hard to find product and fast shipment.<br />Although shipping a little pricey.
B0053ZJI64|5|This is a very nice sticker...I put it on my windshield above the mirror. It's very colorful, and I may get some more for other vehicles in the family.
B006YBC8M2|1|i was expected more for that money
B00HVHA0EG|3|The guard does what it is supposed to do but it does make the key feel a whole lot bulkier. In fact, more than I was expecting it to.
B008CSUTBM|4|Look nice, installed reasonably well.  On hot days after extended use, they sometimes turn off, but have always recovered.
B00LNOK4E4|4|These are installed as halogen fog light replacements in a BMW128i. The light output is not as bright as a halogen and part of the reason may be the shield that covers the front of the lamp. the color is a great match to the HID headlights. Requires computer cancellers specifically for led and the lamp connector in the BMW.
B004J56M2C|1|Did not fit car seat
B001OJM8H4|5|It looks good on a gun box for all Beretta fans.  I got this for my son who just joined the Air Force -- he's a nurse, but he likes to shoot!
B004LQCDOA|5|This thing is fliping awsome it works so fast compared to the viair contraption I had before.
B0084UJYEG|4|Got these for a Christmas Gift and the person loved it.  Definitely keeps the car clean, wish they had made these years ago.
B000GZBZOE|5|Make SURE you are ordering the correct product. There are two types of these ventvisors. One that adheres to the outside of the window frame and one that adheres to the INSIDE of the window tract. The numbers are virtually identical, the only difference being a &#34;1&#34; as the first numeral, the products are not. That being said...the visors themselves are a nice addition. Perfect for humid days or when driving in a rain and wanting to keep things &#34;fresh&#34; in the cab.
B007V2C83C|5|Husband loves this gold one for his MKX.....the color matches. It's easy to use - just fold up when done - no pesky rolling up.
B0012APN3Q|4|Have a small trailer so this controller would do the job. Was easier to install and using it would not be so complicated. The trailer is not use every day so the price was great also. A good invest for a little more in stopping help when you need it.
B00Q577OOW|5|Works great. I use it for my Abus Granite Detecto  alarm on my front rotor. I see it every time. It's a good product.
B00AYXZJ5O|5|The top engine cleaner is useless unless you have a specialty tool, but other stuff worked great :)
B001O9Z7DG|5|I am so happy I bought this backrest, with a little elbow grease I was able to keep back passenger seat on as well so I am very happy. It is also at the perfect angle for me and takes a lot of pressure of my back! If your looking for a backrest buy this one you won't be dissapointed.
B00IE5ZKWQ|5|Great sticker, good quality!
B001EOYIKE|5|For the CRV I upgraded to the two inch receiver for the ease of installation. No drilling. Four bolts (the nuts are welded on by the manufacture) and a U-bolt. 25 minute install. Looks good too.
B000F3RYGA|1|Got this as part of keyed alike triple pack with draw bar and hitch lock. Ordered despite negative reviews about fit and keys breaking. Dumb me. Just what happened; poor fit (lock bar doesn't close down on hitch), and the keys were weak and two twisted off. If it fits your hitch, then it's probably a good lock But really, if the mfg can't design a solid key you oughta have little confidence in the rest of it. I'm not even going to try their &#34;lifetime guarantee&#34;, I'll never use this brand again. Ever.
B0051ZG07G|5|This is exactly as advertised, the 70th Anniversary Badge.  Looks great and obviously super easy to install (peel the sticky back and apply).  The final touch on the new Jeep.
B002RSIK4G|5|Eternabond is the best product on the market and cheapest price on Amazon. Much easier and resists branches than just applying Dicor self levelling roof sealant
B007NZSEJE|1|NOT!!!!!  Absolutely DO NOT BUY THIS RIP OFF PRODUCT.  It is cheap, does not fit, and doesn't look like what is pictured.  I am returning it.  There is another product on the market for twice the price, but I thought I would save myself some money.  My mistake.  We always get what we pay for!  OOPS.
B00176MVQM|3|A nice cover in other ways but very thin/fragile and tears very easily.  Don't try to pull it over anything remotely sharp/pointed as it will catch and tear.
B00ET8JL9U|5|Extremely easy to install.  These made a huge difference in light output.  I can see much better at night.
B005DSOAD2|5|If u buy the grill might as well get the bumper grill and it fits perfect on my  04' F150..And very easy to install.Great Buy
B008VQ1LW6|5|Fast and fit perfectly
B002P8JGT6|5|I had broken off the driver's side mirror on my car....It's an old car, so did not want to spend a lot of money on a new one. This mirror was about $35 I think. It arrived as promised, got it installed in about ten minutes...the mounts and electrical connector were perfect. It is made of plastic, and didn't appear as as sturdy as the original, but its more then strong enough, very well made and works perfectly.    I was 100% satisfied, and shocked that a replacement electric mirror was so cheap.
B001LJHYDK|4|Couple of fasteners missing, but was able to find replacements in my junk.  Plan ahead and allow time, these are not quick mounts especially on uneven or services of different materials.  Had to modify bolts to long screws on one of the two I mounted, due to no access on bottom.  They work and I think I will be satisfied with them.
B001FCG7XG|5|Wanted total window coverage.  Works as described.  Easy to use and install.  Will keep rv cooler in summer camping trips.
B00H88EAVC|5|The covers look great and match up very good. I have not installed them as of yet. It has to be warm to install them for the adhesive to bond well. the temp here has been very cold but i have installed them on a friends truck before .they install very easy. Nice product and they make the vehicle look great in my opinion. this company is good to deal with an follows up after the sale to see if there are any problems. Short turn around on shipping and the product arrived in excellent condition
B006CSP77K|5|Easy to program, few step that you need to follow for successfully, just follow the steps had is provided and you should have no problem. If you know how to read it should be easy. The packet brings instructions and easy to follow. No need to take it to an expert to do it. Price awesome it save you $100.00 to do it your self. Do don't pay someone else how price to buy it and program it when you can do it your self.
B003SZ89Y8|5|Easy install.  Works flawless.
B004ZF4MW8|5|Great product!!  Easy installation.  Great customer service. Very reliable company that stands by their product. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B0051NXPX0|5|I bought this item because while out west last year, I lost the one that came with the T-Bag. I plan to continue riding long trips this year and find that a waterproof cover is essential to my continued comfort while traveling. The T-Bag for my Gold Wing is the perfect companion to the other storage points on the bike.
B008K22MRE|5|Sorry for the delay in my response, but I just had the pads activated yesterday. Yes, they were activated. They work wonderfully, after the dealer tried to put fear in me that they probably wouldn't & I would have to pay again to have the right ones activated. Thanking GOD for this alternate path to save money & have a quality product.
B000N4YGMQ|4|I CHOSE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IN OUR LINE OFBUSINESS, WHICH IS FARMING, WE SOMETIMES ARE MOVING EQUIPMENT DOWN ROADS AT NIGHT, AND THIS LIGHT MAKES THAT A LOT EASIER.
B000EDQR4Q|5|Really keeps things in place in the fridge when traveling!!
B001TIKHF0|4|Great product I use this to help keep car trailer loaded properly and to help load car  cars that are low to the ground or with flat tires<br />Only complaint is that it seems a little noisier.Small price to pay for big convenience. Used daily to pick up cars for massjunkmycar so it's seen lots of use.
B000CPA8B4|4|Sorry, I'm not going to be able to review it as a truck bed liner; I bought it to paint on the bottoms of two bathtubs and the floor of a shower stall. I happened across a recommendation for its use as a traction aid in product reviews; it is both surprisingly effective and incredibly easy to apply. I'm no longer concerned when a visitor bathes at my house, the floor and bottoms of the bathtubs are as non-slip as any of the expensive (and woefully short-lived) appliques available in bath shops and home improvement stores can make them, and, if the spray-in liner of my truck is any indicator, may not need to be \\"refreshed\\" for years; I'll probably replace the tubs and shower before the floors need recoating.
B001FAK3S8|5|great
B00AZ4S904|1|Horrible. The package was find but the parts inside were broken. Got it as a gift for someone what a disappointment.
B000OV7DX2|5|We was very pleased. The part came quickly and was good quality. Exactly what we ordered.
B00G08XQ1G|5|Easy replacement.  Part is exactly what was needed and works perfectly
B004I8TPQK|5|great
B0082GMYEE|2|It slides under my feet and not quite heavy enough for the money
B007VXD1WI|3|I purchased the smoke Anzo 3rd brake light to pair with my black Anzo LED taillights on my silver 2003 Dodge Ram 1500.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The unit looks good in smoke and matches my taillights very well.<br />2. The installation was simple.<br />3. Unit seems to be functioning as it should.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The fit is not perfect. When installing the unit I took special care to tuck the wires but there is a 1/8-1/4&#34; gap that is visible around the light. I hope that the foam on the back of the unit will seal out any moisture but the gap does concern me.<br />2. The white cargo light LEDs are pretty much useless. This was okay because I have a fiberglass tonneau cover on my truck but if i had an open bed I would have sent it back for one that utilizes a standard bulbs on the outsides.<br />3. Like most Anzo LED products the resistor is separate and had a piece of 3m adhesive to mount it behind the 3rd brake light. When I went to pull off the tape the whole 3m strip came right off. I had a piece of 3m tape in the garage but this was a minor inconvenience.
B008R1DQW8|5|I bought RejeX to protect my car from the infamous Florida love bugs.  I applied RejeX as instructed and let it cure.  The next day I drove the car, and ran into a swarm of love bugs.  They can be difficult to remove since they seem to stick to the paint, and will ruin it if not removed ASAP.  I usually have to scrub hard to get rid of them from the car, but not this time.  A simple wipe with a wet paper towel and off they came.  Within the next few days I had bird droppings and road tar.  Both came off with almost no effort.  Brake dust is easy to remove now.  I didn't put RejeX on my windshield, but plan to do so now.  My car looks like it has a glass coating on it now, and I no longer dread driving through love bugs.  My car sits out in the sun, and hopefully RejeX will help protect the paint for a few months.
B000ANOUHG|2|Barely any heat at all, not worth it and I'm far to lazy to return it.  Gave it one extra star because the seller does support APO addresses.
B00H5F2Y5C|5|This stem caps do a super job of keeping dirt out of the stem area. They are very well made and look great. They are very long and take about twice as long to screw on as a standard plastic cap. I've found that only becomes a problem if the tire has a slow leak and air is needed every couple of days.
B00N6EGVM8|1|Not the size, I thought it would be
B000C9GYOA|5|brand new AC Delco heater control great parts
B00KVAFC20|1|Does not work as intercom  ordered two and they DO NOT pair to each other to make an intercom..
B0054KW8HY|5|I purchase a new truck and ordered these since the dealer wasn't given the original keys. (I bought a repossessed truck) It only took me less than a minute to sync the clicker to my truck.
B00I2W1IP4|5|Fit as expected  loving it
B000KE4AOI|4|Replacement for previous saddelman covers that were wearing out after 8 years. 4 star instead of 5 because they are not a perfect fit, but they do fit well, are very durable, and protect your original seats. When I replaced the old covers, seats underneath are still like new.
B009DK3R6W|5|Perfect fit.  Great deal
B0012TRBVE|5|Motorcycle started right up after replacing old battery with the new one. Worked exactly as it should with no more problems.
B007AK9M66|5|Exactly what I needed.  Good quality.  Worked perfectly.
B000JZHAIG|5|2006 Hummer H3 3.5 I5<br /><br />First off idk why they put such a measly engine into a Hummer... BUT, this is an inexpensive way to boost HP, torque and fuel economy. I highly recommend. Easy install and it was fun doing. Sounds weird but working on your vehicle forms some sort of bond,<br /><br />anyway, engine noise was much more significant when reving the engine or flooring the pedal. Sounded like i added an exhaust system, keep that in mind when adding this.<br />I have this and a Gibson exhaust and together they make for a very significant performance boost.
B008EFY1QC|5|It's a K & N air filter. It filters air and gives your car a bit of a boost in mpg and horse power.
B000CITK8S|5|This charger is great. I hook it up in the fall when I put my motorcycle away for the winter and in the spring I unhook it and the bike starts right up.I am very pleased with this purchase.
B004AQZUX2|5|I used these on my Audi S4 and they look great. Price seemed almost too cheap but the bulbs were of good quality and they're still going strong. Glad I found these and saved my money by purchasing these.
B005C5S7V2|5|Excellent choice!  Well made and solid. Just check after car wash.  May lose a nut cover. But a shining choice.
B006LJ8BUK|3|The cable is not a tight as the OE one was but it does the job. Next time I would just pony up the extra money and buy the OE one.
B005VPSEOS|4|Excellent replacement mirror. I would give it 5 stars if the replacement mirror came with the lower cover plate that hids the mounting screws, nuts and wire connections.  In fact I cannot find the cover plate online.
B0009JKI9K|4|It has the backing of rain x and is performing like a new windshield wiper. Nothing really special. It does the job.
B004NL01S8|4|I would recommend this to anyone with a diesel truck.
B0010E3JUI|5|FRAM CF10135 Fresh Breeze Cabin Air Filters work great.  The air conditioner air in my car now smells like, well, Nothing!
B000AS3D3S|5|very good products and everything as it was scheduled thanks indeed.
B004043WZW|3|Was damaged in box not sure if it was from shipping. fit was close.
B00407TUZ0|1|This is a metallic color and maybe that is why is doesn't work, but it sprays out in clumps (yes, shaken properly and at proper temperature).  Actually ruined my quality priming job on a part.  Went to Menards and found a generic silver/metallic that matched pretty well and worked perfectly.  Best part?  You CAN'T return the paint, so I'm stuck with this junk.  Don't waste your money.
B005B0HTXK|5|Love showing my Support for my Son and the military!
B001J0T95C|5|when i ordered this produce i was not even sure what i needed but it came quickly and was packaged well. it could have used some instructions but was easy enough to install
B008B5TVC4|5|Received item quickly and installed it using information found on the web. This is the current part specified for my vehicle and it works perfectly.
B0019CSNNY|5|This thing is so nice! I extended it all the way out so I could do the outside of my ground floor windows too. This item is of good quality and I recommend it.
B0014FGVVW|5|Well... even us top line mechanics can crossthread a plug when we're not paying attention I guess. This was on my personal vehicle. Plug would start, and then walk it's way WAY sideways. Picked this up in the proper size, greased the heck out of it, popped it down into the hole, expanded the threads finger tight, and backed it right on out. Did it 2 more times for good measure. No fuss at all. Plug threaded right in. Car has about 1500 miles on it since then, including high RPM use, and I've had no compression issues.<br /><br />Will recommend this all day long to home mechanics, and shop mechs. Any questions, feel free to post.
B0081MFCJI|5|works well, automatically stops at pre-programmed pressure, stores easily in car; great if you travel in the country and don't want to use a bicycle pump to air-up your tires!
B0000AXTUY|5|Several years and counting. Used on my show trucks, garden tractor, generator, and Honda Cat Sprayer. I have not purchased a battery in years for my vehicles. One of my trucks is a SS454 (customized). The vehicle sits for months under a carport. I would need to purchase a new battery almost every spring but have not in 3 years now. The Schumacher Charger keeps the 900 cold crank battery ready all the time. Pays for itself over and over.
B004GE9J8A|3|The bumper extension not of the same quality but it was fine for a 26 year old car
B005KYR98W|5|I have 2013 Chevy Silverado 4x4 LTZ. Awesome sound and great look. Saved an eighth of a tank in fuel on highway on full tank. Not at all difficult to install despite no installation instructions with the part.
B00F5WBXAE|1|This unit has a recurring shutdown issue during record. Device would constantly power off at different intervals. The video quality was good but the contact attention to get this dashcam to work was a constant frustration.  All attempts (email, phone or chat session) to contact E-Prance to obtain warranty tech support went unanwered or unresponded. Afterwards I engaged Amazon customer service which provided a full refund.  I would stay away from E-Prance products due to non-existant tech support.
B00J8TNH8G|5|Good price and quality.
B005JW2OM6|1|totally not satisfied . items did not match my bike
B004M3IOPY|5|EXCELLENT!  The best spray for my carb's. 1956 Desoto dual Carter's. 2476s & 2445s.<br />They look spectacular. Kept the bases natural cast aluminum. Painted the bowls, airhorns,<br />pump cover, etc. Polished the screws with a Dremel and buffing wheel. You can probably<br />stretch one can to do two carbs, but why? For the money, I coated each carb several times,<br />so used one can per. Now, if it would stop freaking snowing in New England, I could take the<br />car out for a drive!  Highly, highly recommend this.
B004KL0I9I|4|This appears to work reliably. I use it with the Torque app on Android phone. I have not tried the software that comes with it.
B002LF7GYK|5|Excellent!  Thank you, DWF.
B000SOKE5E|5|I love this funnel, keeps water and junk out and is wide enough to keep me from splashing gas all over.
B00ACXFL5E|5|EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PRODUCT IS AWESOME!
B0067BNBFM|5|The seat fit great.  Very easy install.  I am sure it will even get more comfortable the more I ride.  The shipment came faster than expected.
B008FCDFXE|5|The liners were received in less than a week.  They were easy to install.  They fit very snug.  They look great and really finish off that rough look underneath the bed.  I can't figure why GM would not make this a standard accessory.
B0007YZB80|5|This is what I call a &#34;no-brainer.&#34; It perfectly replaced just the rubber blade on the 2011 Sienna Driver's side. I've always hated how it is nearly impossible to get these at local auto parts stores; they only sell whole wiper assemblies, which is easier, yes, but so wasteful. Yes, the dealership has them, at a mere $18 (this is my local dealership, yours may be cheaper) for just the rubber part, not the metal rails. EIGHTEEN DOLLARS!!<br /><br />I should point out that the metal rails that come with these are different from the original Toyota rails, so I'd suggest you hang onto those, as the OEMs work better for locking the blade into place.
B0009OR8ZM|5|needed a strong snap ring plier in a very restricted space to pull the retaining ring from the rear axel of a Fiat 124 spider.  After hours of frustrating attempts finally broke down and bought this tool, and within an hour had both sides off.  Great, Strong, well made and NOT the low quality so many tools are made with today.
B008VGJ2F4|5|t just love this electric jack it works good has a very good lift it could be faster but it is ok
B000VSY4HG|5|Nice keyed alike lockset for trailering.  I hate having more than one key for anything, this is a quality lockset with a nice carry case.  well worth it.
B000ANOUHQ|5|I had pulled a muscle in my back. I have an hour drive to work. Getting out of the car was a struggle for me after sitting in the cold seat for an hour - with back problem. I ordered this heat cusion and it saved my back! The delivery could not be better. It's on sale now.  I'm buying another one just incase mine stops working ever.
B00RLXLQFC|5|Love it but won't pay 10 dollars to ship a STICKER.
B0049RVHUW|5|They work and as good as OEM.
B000CFRL3M|5|This is a multi application radiator.  If the sensor port is too small, simply remove the restrictive lip inside the port with a screwdriver or a 13/32nd drill bit.  buy removing this lip (or ring) a larger port will be exposed.
B00GT2RKQK|5|Great products. Did a drain and fill with the motul dctf fluid on my evo x. Shifts like butter.
B0006IX7W4|5|The product is as descibed. we have been using these for for over a year to hang a tarp off our awning. these have worked out very well.
