B00APL7OHG|3|They're cheap plastic and crack easily. But for $20, you can't really complain too much, right?
B003V57NUQ|1|Parts don't fit together properly.  Had to re-drill because holes didn't line up.  Actual size of the J-Bar is smaller than competing products and not as well padded.
B0002MABGE|1|DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO SECURE LARGE DOGS! MY 80LB CHESSIE HAD IT DOWN AND WAS IN MY FRONT SEAT BEFORE I GOT OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY! MY HUSBAND EVEN TIGHTENED THE BARS FOR ME BUT THE METAL MIXED WITH PLASTIC PARTS IS NOT SECURE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
B00LM56CP4|5|These are my all-time favorite I bought 20 packs so I never run out
B0050EGS5W|5|I am very happy with this product. Originally was going to go the easy route with an external model, then realized I wasn't comfortable with a very expensive product so easily accessible by others who may want to steal it. I have a travel trailer and once you have spent a few years using it, especially if you have kids you understand the value of not having to store and retrieve another piece of equipment for your camp trip!<br /><br />Installation was easy and there are several ways of installing based on your trailer configuration and shore power inlet. Technically you can place it anywhere along the line before your trailers fuse box. My shore power is at the rear so I installed in an unused space in a cabinet that was already where the shore power comes into the trailer. I also have a back door in this location which allows me to hook up and easily read if there are any issues with the power supply. Also unless you want to be a fanatic about your numbers, do yourself a favor and install the display in a location that isn't indirect line of sight in your living space. In my view this is a plug in, confirm good power and forget concept. Enjoy your camping and don't worry about the numbers. This unit will protect your rig!!!!<br /><br />This leads me to performance. I installed this unit early this season; around May 2015. We have gone on 5 trips and around 20 nights of camping so far. This unit worked great and as it claims. First couple of trips I plugged in and had no errors and solid power, we had great camping. The last few trips as we led into the hot summer and more AC usage among most TT's, 5th's and MH's. I have had several instances where the unit shutdown the power supply due to low voltage. This is a huge deal as extensive damage can occur to your AC unit, refrigerator, microwave etc.. with low voltage. Additionally this past weekend I plugged in to several power poles and the unit errors indicated &#34;Open Ground.&#34; Be sure to check your AC unit and unfit is equipped with delay protection. If not remove the pins from this unit and it will have around 240 seconds of delay time before providing power again. Important for your AC's compressor. It's all in the installation instructions.<br /><br />Get this unit, protect your investment and enjoy your family, your RV and the great outdoors!<br /><br />One last word of advice. Get yourself a power line monitor that you can quickly use to plug into the power pole and determine if there are any open ground, polarity, voltage or any other issues. The open ground issues I mentioned I could only discover after picking the perfect spot for our family, backing into an extremely difficult spot, getting it just right between those trees to fit our slide only to discover the power was not there. I am looking to purchase one for about $30 here on Amazon. That way I can jump out of the truck and quickly check the power before anything else. That is huge time saver, stress reliever and that was a bit of free marital counseling advice for those who know what I am talking about.d unfit is equipped with delay protection.

B0097IECXM|5|Perfect fit for 2015 Toyota Sienna. Received product 3 days after ordering.
B000BNXRB0|5|Husbands 60th birthday was perfect. He was so excited
B003CSP7L4|5|Great product.  I have bad knees so it really helps pad the bed of my truck so that I can comfortably load under my canopy.
B008BX7G9G|5|Looks awesome!  2014 ram 1500.. wiring a little bit of work
B000TYSBYY|5|Ugh! The trouble we have had with our 2007 Jeep Liberty tail lights... lemme tell ya... we've gotten pulled over at LEAST 6x to be told our tail lights were out, we'd mess around with the sockets and the lights & they kept burning out - we've replaced them now (for so little $ too!) and now there are no more issues with tail lights - awesome :)
B00VKT66CQ|5|It worked as expected but between the time of order and receiving the original started to work again.  lol  I just tried to see if it worked and it did but keeping in case of original quitting again.
B00SXE4GI2|5|Great lightweight cover.  Very easy to deploy and roll/fold up.  :^)
B000ALG88M|5|Meet all expectations great product
B0013CUA86|1|I removed them right away.  One of the bulbs was already bad when it arrived, and the other went poof when I turned the headlights on.  No, I didn't touch them, and was very careful about the m touch anything.  This isn't my first rodeo with Xenon bulbs.  Nothing good to say on my end on this purchase.
B00O4G1FY6|5|The key chain is correct for the C3 corvettes and the color matches the interior. Well made.

B000C9MWO6|4|This has been a great cap for me.  Very sorry for you that are having hiccups with it or what-not.  I do have one question though.  I have this on a 2004 Chevy Tahoe.  The Factory tether ring does not fit this cap as the ring is too thick for the amount of space provided with this cap.  Has anyone had any luck finding a replacement tether?
B0017DGO2M|1|This product did not work well for me at all. It took 4 days to dry and it got all over my pillows and my clothing.....it just wasn't what I expected. I would not recommend this product to anyone

B006B2YI6S|4|Really nice fit, just could use a slight adjustment to be perfect, but works great and feels long lasting. Glad I spent a bit more for this one, It was worth it.
B001N1Y8V2|5|Its a mirror, it reflects things; maybe somethings you dont want to reflect as well!
B00275KX6M|1|Update to review.  It's junk!  White turns to yellow after 10 months.

B004A6I3V8|5|Perfect fast shipping great price

B004IYQV34|5|Big savings over OEM price. Replaced by local shop, Car runs great!
B000X9EGFS|5|Works great...better than I expected
B00SBZRKEU|5|This is a great product. Works great for the price. Bought one for my father in law and he loves it. Makes it much easier to fuel his boat rather than lifting heavy gas cans. I would recommend to my friends and family.
B00JFTC0T6|5|Easy to install....
B00480GY0S|5|I can see
B0029XLN1Q|5|Item arrived early & was exactly as described

B00DMTTSIQ|4|fits perect
B00KQY8T1W|1|The mitts I received barely measure 8 Length x 6-1/2&#34; Width..  NOT 9-1/2 x 7&#34; As Advertised..  Too small for Medium hand size. WARNING!! They WILL BLEED in warm water so DO NOT put White micro towels (or Underwear) in with unless you want them permanently light blue
B00K8915PC|5|I was a bit apprehensive because local Ford dealer wanted more than 3x the money, but all was fine.

B0081SXO56|5|It works good even over the cracks in the driveway.
B0014FKI1Q|5|Wide mouth opening makes easy to use.
B00651CLCS|5|I bought this to replace the long antenna on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler. Looks a lot nicer and I don't have to remove it to install my car cover. Radio channels tune fine.
B0002MABGE|4|It's hard to titan bed to stay.
B00Q4HH6Z0|4|Works good
B00BGH4FC0|4|For the price and the quality of the brakes, it was a good buy. They fit right in with ease. I was hesitant to buy brakes over the Internet with the fear that they wouldn't fit, however that was not the case.
B00FXLJ8U4|5|It eliminated a  safety concern of ours and we bought a extra pair for our children. Thanks!
B00JMLEWXY|5|Never used this type of tool before. It didn't come with any directions, but once I figured it out it was easy to use. I couldn't do the repair with out it. Made the repair so much easier. I would definitely recommend it.
B001TXWNLQ|5|As described, fast shipping!!!!
B001C5SBYO|5|Awesome for night riding
B00FZMVO8U|5|Loud
B001BFO7DO|1|Said it would fit my 1995 Dodge Ram 1500, but it did not my original actuator is significantly longer then this one.
B0065UNTKM|5|excelent
B00TI0DE4W|5|Great fan
B0053ZAIYU|1|Hopefully you read the reviews before you purchase! You will most likely not receive a front and back light. You will receive a 2 pack of the front or back lights.
B004S2X03U|5|It was perfect. No problems.
B0067P09B2|5|Sounds incredible on my 2012 Vstar 1300 tourer. Nice and throaty.
B00FDVM0QS|5|It was nice to hold in my hand such a nice high quality product made in the USA! Thank you for providing a tool to help protect our C-5!
B00B9F82F0|5|workinwd good
B000RN04RO|5|This works as a great helmet bag and does a good job of protecting my helmet and storing it while traveling.
B00J0C8AV0|5|good product
B000C33KQ6|5|worked perfectly
B00503PZDY|5|Husband loved. 2010 camaro now sounds like 69. Easy install and great look.
B00230GC6Q|3|I thought this was supposed to be a ball=less whistle, which it is not. It's fine for a cheap, plastic whistle.
B00GY6LWVA|5|This light is awesome, its super bright and exceeded my expectations especially for a little ten inch. You're not gonna regret it if u buy one.
B00069CN2I|5|GREAT....Although these are the only Towing Mirrors that I have used, they are great!  Easy to install or should I say throw over my factory mirrors, very secure and solid with no noticeable vibration or added wind noise.  I hesitated when I ordered these mirrors, but ....I truly am pleased with the purchase.
B0009I5WQ0|5|Simple  and east took about 15 minutes to install  it
B004K9JPMG|5|Arrived as described. Thanks. International postage a little expensive.
B00FAN89C8|3|I was expecting for the vacuum's suction pick-up of the debris on my floor mats, but overall satisfied...
B005UGG6P2|5|Did not use it because whole CV had to be replaced by dealer. BUT 5 STARS because looks like a great product, made in England, meets or exceeds all O.E.M. Specs, mineral based grease, timely delivery, and package (grease) was well packed and protected from leakage as if the Queens jewels were being transported. My fault I could not use it, don't have the guts to return it, but if it can be used for anything else, have the supplier tell me at cusecs26155@mypacks.net what I other use I can apply it to in my car.
B00VKRK5QG|5|I had a problem, but they sent me new u bolts. perfect.
B007613T9U|5|ORDERED ANOTHER
B0095TC6I6|5|Very nice quality
B00FQ0ROZS|5|very bright
B00B0ZZ3CE|5|Quality and color better than expected, price was better here than from my local Dodge dealers.
B00099DW6G|5|the only battery you well ever need.
B002Y35O0M|3|Needed 6 for my Lexus ES300 (2000). Six months later, they're working fine, even though they were shipped from 3 different suppliers.
B001C92Y98|3|Follow up 4/8/17 - The rotors have been doing OK, but they are still rusting, though maybe not as bad as the Chinese ones. Probably not worth twice the money, and will probably not buy again. (Last two photos from 4/8/17, after 20 months of service.  Appear to be very well made. Perfect fit. Work great on my truck. I will give a follow up review after they have been used through the winter to compare how they held up to cheap Chinese rotors.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Really easy to use and fits my 2003 Buick Century well.
B009UWXMM2|5|Can use a longer mic cable but has good sound overall
B004D5MQOG|5|Perfect fit in my Expedition and no leaks thus far. I expect to go 7500K with this and the synthetic oil.
B001DRLQ34|5|OEM quality. Just make sure you have the right one for your car as BMW used two versions on my 2003 E39 525i. One has a fuel pressure regulator built in, the other does not. I'd check under your car first to verify fitment.
B00KUQQU58|5|A good police light for the price
B000COSB14|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues.
B0043RX8DC|5|Very classy.  Well built.  Looks good on my C6.
B002SINC02|5|This blanket is perfect for the beach or for a picnic at the park. It's easy to fold up, keeps butt dry on damp ground, and it's machine washable.
B006ZN4FVG|5|Installed on a 1996 Infiniti g20. Works great, and makes the soft feel more or less like the oem shocks. My last set of kyb's on another car lasted 100k miles so I expect the same from these.
B00KLZ65GM|2|It stretched out quickly.
B001OBO10O|3|Mine is a bit difficult to find the proper adjustment point where I can lock it and release the key.
B00IKL1Y3S|5|its spark plugs cant mess that up. delivery was on time. when i open it there was a spark plug socket inside. WOW made my job easier and made the deal even better. hope everyone gets this deal.
B00AZZV79S|5|I used these to replace the round-pin clips that were in Monster Mats I found for my Passat.  Now, with these new oval clips installed, I can clip in the mats in the back of my Passat.  The newer Monster Mats for my Passat don't have provision for any mounting clip holes, unfortunately, so I was fortunate to find a set in good condition that could be used, with these clips, in my car.
B008S9LEQE|5|Great for my bike aux. extension
B00H1I54VY|5|I liked the wheel lugs a lot an worked perfect with the rims a ordered as well, good buy
B00CPO8204|5|Delivery on time everything as described.
B003A6KZLK|5|Very nice product!
B00AKA58I4|5|awesome
B009304KLS|5|This shade fits my 2015 Altima perfectly. It is easy to use and does keep the car much cooler.
B00H5BS9GE|5|👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
B00SSMOS5U|5|I gave it 5 stars because the product is custom fit to my model of car.  It also keeps the heat out very well.  It does not retain it's stiffness, and therefore does not stay well fitted to the window for more that a week or so.
B000X2533Y|5|The pliers work great on my trailers grease hubs, also good price.
B00Q05KTJG|3|A functional powder horn.  It was inexpensive so it looks cheap and it was.  But it will hold a lot of powder and that's what it's about.  The leather strap should be replaced for hunting as a few minutes in the brush will destroy this one.
B0006VORDY|4|so far so good. could be made a bit sturdier  with thicker grills
B0094E5K9Y|3|Doughnut is too small for the wheel and is being partially crushed by it.  I do not see this lasting long, but only time will tell.
B0023TQEFQ|2|Had to buy on a guess.  Needed it for the high side port on my truck.  It didn't say what size they were in the description, so it was a crapshoot.  These are smaller valve stems.  Had to return, but they ought to work for the correct vehicle.  Do better on your descriptions, Amazon!
B000786JRI|3|Haven't used the warming feature; but the cooling feature is sufficient to keep things from melting in the hot Arizona sun.
B005G9Y29U|5|Went with these stubbies instead of the other ends. Makes the bumper look more aggressive IMO. They bolted up fine and the packaging was good enough to prevent an of the studs from snapping off during shipping.
B001GMONUY|4|My wrangler is topless during the summer. While it prevents the feral cats from getting inside, they (cats) do get on top and sleeps on it and sometimes pees on it. I've had to purchase this 3 times so far because of the urine smell. Luckily, it's cheap enough to purchase every few months?
B00HHGT0BK|1|On my second set and they are bad. Was told I installed them incorrectly they will not warranty more than one set because they only have 1 in a 1000 go bad. Another warning to stay away from these.
B00FS3CB6A|5|I got these for my Class C motor home to use under my back bumper to take the bounce out of motor home when walking inside. They work great
B0002U1TZS|5|This works the way most scratch removers do. It does a great job of removing blemishes and very minor scratches on the surface of the paint. If the scratch has gone through the paint or if you can catch your fingernail on the scratch, this will not remove it. That being said, I used my roof rack to move something and it left a blemish on the roof of my car. This removed the blemish quickly and easily. It is also very good at removing tar, bird poop and bugs from the surface of the paint.
B00H9L7QYQ|5|Great product! Would buy again and again. Very strong rack, and easy assembly. Holds together very well, and looks great! Also the length of the receiver arm is long enough that I can still open the rear hatch door on my jeep. Great product!!
B00I1PFD4Y|5|A little pricey, but Great product that I would highly recommend to others.  I used it for simplistic automotive wiring alternative
B007KOT83Y|1|Not what is pictured and horrible quality- as if it was done a home printer.
B007PKC6KK|5|Velcro Mounted next to my bed, makes a nice little clock to check time with out having the light from a always illuminated display from regular bedside clock
B00KPY5JZW|5|The 47 inch Aeroblade has worked out great for the new SUP taxi system I bought. The locking mechanism is a bit flimsy so if someone is really determined to steal your rack it's achievable. Other than that a great product.
B00R26RCVK|5|Love it.  I normally stop at different routes I can run on my way home from work and this has replaced the 3-4 towels I used to have to put on the car seat to keep it dry.  It completely stops sweat (or any liquid for that matter) from getting on your seats.  If you get in your car sweaty or surf, this is a great.
B00LNIPAIU|1|ripped when I first put them on, very thin material ...........very disappointed.
B000GTX0PW|5|Great grips fit perfect and look amazing
B00HWWVLLQ|5|Great fit
B012E560XO|3|Until Dual releases a firmware upgrade, you should be aware of the potential problems you face with this unit:<br /><br />RDS is automatically updating the clock to whatever the station broadcasts out. While this is very helpful, it makes a false assumption that the station is actually broadcasting the correct time. It would be helpful to bypass the CT option of RDS and just use whatever is manually set by the user.<br /><br />Radio Presets have no option to stay displayed, putting the Equalizer graph back on the screen after 5 seconds. Again, while this is very pretty, it's also annoying and dangerous when attempting to change stations and driving. The station preset button is small to begin with and trying to hit the screen while doing 50 MPH is cumbersome. Perhaps not having it automatically flip back to the Equalizer unless the user taps the screen is the answer.
B000CLSPWW|3|Had good luck with these previously for a different vehicle so decided to buy this brand again for my Subaru. The sheetmetal clips didn't fit the calipers properly and scraped on the rotors. After some adjustments they weren't screeching anymore but the pads still squeal at low speed. Not 100 % satisfied. Applied disc brake silencer too but that didn't help. Other than that they work fine.
B00HDERBLC|1|The Product is damage to two months i need warranty
B00N4EQYPE|1|This did not fit in my 2004 Hyundai Elantra (Avante). The boot was too long and wide, but was rather soft and lovely to look at. The seller promptly accepted my return request without hassle.
B00ZR4324K|5|I purchased the four pack for my two door. I put the grab handles up front and the clothes hangers in the back. Ill save the other set for when this set gets sun faded. I love the Jeep logo on them, they look awesome in my white Wrangler! The seller, Jasonlightbar, was amazing to work with, always keeping me updated on availability of products!
B003BZD03K|5|This provided the perfect hookup for our new fifth wheel with the water hookup in an enclosed cabinet.
B00L1S0JU6|5|Great Product, and great company. Item was delivered fast. Boyfriend really loves these towels when cleaning his car and toys:)
B001W9OP86|3|did not exactly fit my 2007 toyota corolla on the back seats. Had to punch holes for the two head rests. There was no cover for the middle head rest.  did not have openings for the seat belt guide loops.
B000CKBJ44|5|I've used these rotors on several of my vehicles over the past several years and I'm very pleased.  Never had any issues or problems.
B00RFLBDZS|1|Ohm meter function is useless. Measuring compressor clutch coils and hydraulic coils reads 0 resistance. DVOM reads 12 ohms.<br />Volt meter is off by .2 volts DC
B0051PJWQW|4|Applied the sealer after cleaning the headlights.  That was over a month ago and my lights have remained brighter than before.<br />To early to tell if I fully endorse it.
B005PZMLDY|5|I bought these car seat covers for my 2004 Hyundai Sonata. They fit just fine and I don't see any reason why they wouldn't fit any sedan with seats that are more or less modern. I liked these so much, I bought another set for my wife's 2009 Toyota Yaris.   There are some three-minute installation videos on the internet and the instructions are well-written (only in English) and include the internet address for watching the videos. In short, each seat has a &#34;back&#34; cover that slips over the top and a &#34;seat&#34; cover that is tied down with straps like those on a backpack. You'll have to crouch down a bit to install them, but it's easy. It took me about an hour the first time and twenty minutes the second time when I put some in my wife's car.   These covers seem like they will hold up well, even though they are not the highest quality. If you want something that you can do yourself, this is the way to go. If you want something any more professional and longer lasting, you'll probably have to go to a custom shop and pay a lot more.  Overall, I'm happy with this product, especially because the price here (about $30) is way better than anything I found in retail stores and the installation was easy.
B00CRPAHKE|5|Perfect for my application, siphoning diesel from 5 gallon cans into my tractor.
B004IWYBXS|5|Fit and finish was spot on.
B00XC7SSL6|3|Got here quick, but the part didn't actually fit and I had to sand all the buttons down. Surprised that it worked properly with how much I had to sand
B00X5GF2RM|3|Literally a sticker that doesn't hold up well and yellows in days.
B00PLCVQHI|4|Its actually very cute and a Great design but I didn't like how the plastic sticks really hard to the screen but some ppl might like that
B004HII1G6|5|FACTOR FIT IS GREAT.
B00A82A3RK|5|Nice replacement for my 6 year old Diehard battery jumper. Came charged and ready to go. Hope I get the same battery life as the original one.
B00E6CBXM2|3|Small rings for back speakers are good, fit correctly.  Not so much for the larger ones for the front speakers.  Need to align small cut in protective cover at 6 o'clock position, but ring is slightly larger then area to cover, so it slightly overlaps in one area.  Also small cut in protective cover for alignment has also cut into the metal ring leaving a black spot on the metal ring. Looks ok but not perfect.  Bad job leaving mark in metal after cutting area for alignment.
B00HJ6RUCE|1|Read the fine print, this is for grey when the picture shows white, frustrating when all other orders where white and this order was placed last minute because I was one the short of what I needed. Please change picture and put GREY in title description
B000C9NXOO|5|Works well.
B00JZR3IEO|5|Hard to find - these gauge 10 disconnects are great. If you need to move a lot of amps you need to use more than the typical gauge 12 or 14 wire. I used these for my solar power system in my RV for disconnects on the array side (60 volts- 6 amps) and on the battery side (12 volts - 18 amps).
B000O3M5CE|5|Great
B00DU24YKW|5|Great price with mail in rebate!
B0002SR544|5|Tbi owners need this to check the fuel pressure without all the hassles of messing behind the throttle body , save time and money , if you only use it once you saved yourself money
B00D2HTIIS|4|Great set for the price. Works great!
B006BZIGL8|5|These were so easy to install. Once I get all the timing done I will really see if these work like they should.
B001TPUCKI|5|Purchased this for my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500. Old fan began making all kinds of racket. This was a very quick job that took about 10-15 minutes total time. Fan is quiet and moves air very well.
B0062V2VIK|5|Excellent product it´s fits perfect on my Hyundai Accent 5-Door Hatchback, it takes about 10 minuts to install from box to the roof, easy, all accesories are on the box
B000IS9F9G|5|They are fine
B007MUY6LA|5|They are doing everything I wanted
B00HNMLQAG|4|worked for me
B00Y09N8T2|4|Good product, great seller! The first one I got the USB ports didn't work properly. I had to hold the usb port just right to get anything to charge. After contacting SENHAI with my problem they sent me a replacement that works great. Now I have two. Awesome customer service.
B0093E8SRG|5|Just as good as the factory ones
B00LNDLGWE|5|Quality item at an affordable price point.  Easy to wire in and install.
B000ENN9KG|5|Great product
B0042XORMI|5|Nice assortment of fuses.
B009XIDC7I|5|Very good I absolutely follow directions and completing the top on my car and this is a very wonderful to to have for you do it yourself people out there awesome
B00V3MAMXO|4|The quality was what I expected but I didn't realize it was designed for only Illinois plates so they couldn't be used on my cars.  It would be nice if they made a universal plate cover for those who are fans but moved to another state and to clarify that on the description.
B0007TFL6W|5|Great fit on my 2014 mustang.
B001GJ3FIS|4|Not as powerful as expected, comparing to other nozzles, but still good with all the options.
B00192QB3I|5|Just ask your neighbor who did not get this at a campsite.
B004B61B34|4|Received quickly,  easy to install.
B00447204O|5|This cover was the highest quality tow hitch cover I have ever seen. The cover is metal and is securely attached to the trailer hitch with two screws.
B00F84XZOQ|4|OK
B000BR51BK|5|wonderful
B004KPPE66|5|Good fit and works well -
B00480GYSA|3|I bought these by mistake, and could not return them since I live in Mexico and the cost was higher than what I had payed for the original product.
B000CF6RX2|4|Precise fitment on my F350, easy to install. what else can I say.
B00CNEQYF6|4|Good quality product.
B001Y93RKQ|5|My husband very pleased!!
B00NWT4UFC|1|Ordered this because it said it would fit my 2008 F-150 with automatic but didn't come close. Sent it back and ordered correct one that the web page said wouldn't but another reviewer stated the measurements and it did fit.
B00AQZARIE|5|Just Right exactly what I needed it.
B00GSZQ8NE|5|Made a big difference thank you good product I would recommend this product
B001U2DPUE|1|Did not work.
B0027XYKZO|5|Installed a month ago and works fine.
B00CMC5DII|5|Much easier to use than other tap types.  Spliced a rear view camera into my car's reverse lights.
B001U60T9U|5|These fit great, almost perfect. Certainly worth the money paid and a great savings over the true &#34;custom fit&#34; option for more than four times the money. I wish I read the instructions before I started to install them, in particular for the part about the front side airbags, I had the driver side all perfect then I realized I put the passenger side cover on the driver seat! Whoops. The directions are pretty clear, and surprisingly helpful. If you want these to look great I suggest taking your time and adjusting them to perfection. It took me about 2 hours (had to vacuum under the rear seat, and as I mentioned earlier I put the wrong cover on the driver seat). My husband and mother in law both loved them - neither of them could believe how well they fit, and what I paid!
B000QH43YQ|5|Just put this plate on my G35X. Great chrome finish and nice thickness unlike low quality plates. Makes there car look even more high end
B004UHF7GG|4|i bought this battery,which worked great at first,but eventually completely died.customer service was great though and they issued a full refund.
B00BUX6M4O|5|great
B00G9WA1ZC|5|I purchased this bag in 2014 and put it on a luggage rack on the trunk of my Honda Goldwing motorcycle. There was never any sagging. I was on the freeway in 2015 when a truck with a giant couch in the back, that was not tied down, came flying off directly in front of me. The motorcycle and I both hit the freeway asphalt at about 50 miles an hour. The motorcycle was totaled out. I was spared due to having all my protective riding gear on, including an Air Vest. To address all your concerns in this one sentence, I now have the same bag on my new Honda Goldwing motorcycle, which came out of the accident with only a couple of road rashes, hardly noticeable. I couldn't say enough about this bag and I have no employment, financial interest or stock in this company, although in thinking about it, I should!
B00JK6QLIU|5|now i can use my alarm.
B005MJYTYC|1|This brace is poorly made.  It started to come apart after worn only 3 times while wakeboarding.  Very disappointed and feel the manufacturer should reimburse me.
B002IB0PEA|5|Bought it for my daughter car and she loves it
B004A66JMI|5|Works great!  Fit my 2003 Subaru Legacy
B004GC95LS|5|It fit good.
B000OAG63G|5|Works well, as advertised.
B004ALEZJW|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00EDD6Q3A|2|The fob is medium quality which about matches the OEM. If you're buying it for a Saturn you'll have to go to the dealer. Saturn Vue requires access to the car's firmware to install a new remote.
B000BUOSGG|4|So cute! Fits perfectly in my R.V. sink. The only thing is, it is hard to fit cups onto the cup holders....not a big deal!
B0085IDD0S|5|Right on
B00OSSPONI|5|This is exactly what I Need.
B003VCDI7G|5|A+
B0006Z9SQQ|5|Very good
B00IC6LE54|3|The product works well to hold things on top of my SUV, however the color was different from the picture and it was not as waterproof as I would have liked.  It was nice making more room for my family in the truck!
B004H78NQ0|5|Excellent!
B00IGZQTF6|5|fits perfectly. received promptly.
B004470FZK|5|Fit perfect.
B001P2JONQ|5|So far this seems to be the answer to the bumper plugs always working loose and falling out.
B00K889FCI|5|Worked just as advertised.  Took a lot of time to do the prep work, (wet sanding), but worth the effort
B002VE3VHW|4|good quality
B00SJTQTDQ|5|As soon as I got my act together it went good. Ive put 700 mi. with the change and its looking really good.
B00EEQ3WII|5|Cool helmet definitely a good buy
B00439IIP8|4|Works well, some of them stuck REALLY well and others not so much, I would get them again for a cheap motorcycle mod.
B00GSAUHB8|2|This reduces only a little bit of heat. It is still hot in the car. The material is really thin so it's no surprise. I used this for days over 100 degrees F outside.  Probably better off spending more money on something premium.
B0046NPOGC|1|2nd dipstick did not fit
B00DHUA9VA|5|Very easy to install! super simple just be sure to read instructions thoroughly and be sure to push your connections all the way in they fit pretty snug and if you don't sound will go in and out. Glad I double checked those when I was having issues with the sound but other then that this harness works amazing with the factory GM interface my Bose system alone sounds better then it did with a stock radio installed. Everything fits nicely behind the dash in my 04 Yukon and for the money I spent amazon has the best prices on this harness everywhere else I looked it was over 100$
B00J3H9VKQ|4|perfect topper for the lumpy mattress in my toyhauler.
B00V337VNC|5|Looked sharp right out of the box! Looked even better on the car!! Easy to put on and took less than 5 minutes.
B00D01V5KA|5|GORGEOUS!  I GET MANY, MANY COMPLIMENTS!
B000C808SE|5|thats ok, good piece
B004I6RQFO|5|perfect
B0006FKFMC|5|It works perfect !!! Easy and fast !!
B007TGBXG8|5|Very nice !!! Prompt good buy!!!
B0024S5RM2|5|that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller
B001P2A8N6|2|to small
B000VZ2ZB6|4|Ddoes what I need it for, low frequency use at desk and traveling.
B00J14AILM|5|Great value for the money.  Mats that are thicker cost disproportionately more.  The mats we got do smell a little - my daughter thought it was a new car smell.  We've had them only about a month but haven't encountered any real bad weather. We like them and recommend them.
B000C9RT8U|4|Well seems to do whats its designed for so far.
B005G6J3EM|5|Great quality, good looking sticker. Thanks!
B00H9K8A2O|5|product is as described ,will order again
B00MGN0LY4|4|Got it on time and worked great.
B000E81VN8|5|This has been a god send for my back SUV area. It is rigid and does not collapse. Fit my trunk area perfectly. A good find indeed.
B009G4Y9RG|5|Cheep but works
B00TP0I210|5|fit perfectly
B00NC3G6MS|5|Thank you
B003CJSAEE|3|I recently purchased this product to transport my motorcycle cross-country, however, when I asked a Harley dealership to assist me with loading my motorcycle onto the trailer, the assistant advised that he didn't like this type of product and we just used conventional tie-down straps.  Never used it.
B0008FUH3M|1|Poor guailty for ext. mirrors do not recommend them
B00BFEBWYI|5|Have applied ER to the gear box of tractor implements and can tell you that is makes a difference! Not only does the unit sounds like it is rotating with less effort, after a couple of hours of constant use on Rotary Cutter and Finish Mower, the temperature of case is noticeably lower. Tractor, cars, and small engines are next!
B00C5RBRA8|5|best that there is on the market
B00AAIPDRM|1|im sorry but this coat of arms is wrong, for starters the bagratuni flag is not blue but there are other things wrong as well do not buy this fake item
B00C88AK3Y|5|This kit is literally plug and play I was done in 5 minutes
B002YXC07W|4|Works wonderful
B00823FSRC|5|Great
B007RRYW4E|5|Awesome bell!!!
B000C544X2|4|Everything it is suppose to be.
B00863OHZW|2|Too high.
B000H961YI|5|Great experience. Fast shipping.
B003ZAICRU|4|Arrived as described, looks better than the OEM unit that was on my CBR 600-F2. Bolted right into the factory location and plugged right into the factory wiring. The bike idles at 14+ volts, so it appears to be in good order.
B004QJL5XW|1|Horrible, black part of this key chain gone after 2 weeks. It did not get drop or hit anything, just one day got unattached, AVOID!!!
B00CHH5UQ8|5|These lug nuts are a real savings in price fitment is perfect
B000BO4WU4|4|Great for a pinch but nothing special. It will leave a mess all over the inside of your wheels that is difficult to clean, seriously difficult don't use it you don't need to.
B00XCANO4O|5|As with most tools, there are quality tools and there are lesser to bargain basement quality tools.  Each seems to hold a place depending on one's need and budget.  As for the TireTek Truck-Pro gauge, this is first class quality.  This is a professional quality gauge.<br /><br />Now with the above said, this tool is &#34;large&#34; and not necessarily glove-compartment friendly.  But if you drive a small automobile, you may not need this particular model.<br /><br />Frankly, I think that this may be the best gauge that I have purchased.  But time will tell.  If I made my living by driving, there is no doubt that I would want this tool.  But for the regular Joe out there, if you do check your tire pressures because you know that you life may depend on it, buy this gauge.<br /><br />Finally, this may sound &#34;corny&#34; but after you purchase this gauge, the Owner of the company will follow up with you via e-mail.  He asks, &#34;are you satisfied and if not, let me know and I will make it right&#34;.  That counts in my book.  Anyone who makes a product and cares enough to check with his customers is top class with me.  From here on, anyone who asks me about professional tire gauges (truckers, RV'ers, ranchers and regular folks) I will direct them to TireTek.
B009DJS0N8|3|needed a conversion to fit
B00V09RW3I|5|Excellent product looks good! 2014 ram 1500 .. install little tricky... have to remove grill from truck to install
B00BYJJSLS|5|These are great quality ballasts with amazing out put
B009MASYRA|5|The sunshade fit perfectly.
B00V9W6QTW|5|installed easy and work perfect
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy to use and works great! I am impressed with the quality for the price and how thin the product is.
B00YT7O8ZI|5|They work great
B00PV5DT7K|5|They look amazing in my Altima!
B00AMLQ7V8|5|Was easy to install on my 2007 Toyota Tundra Double Cab. I wish they stuck out a little further from the truck though.
B0023VB8KU|3|I purchased a set and both the lights went out in less than a month.  So my $100 set turned into a $130 set :/ but they arrived on time and now work.
B00LB47Q8S|5|Works great
B000WJDPDI|5|I bought these for a 2003 Yamaha FZ1.  They are noticeably stronger than stock.  Work great!
B00HFKN93S|5|Good buy
B003ENG8WY|5|I have had this visors on my 04 Honda pilot for about 3 weeks.  I have been down the interstate multiple times they don't seem to mind it at all.  I have also ran them through the automatic car wash with no problem.  They look nice and are well made.  They do attach with sticky tape.  Which is already on the visor.  The noise in our Pilot was always very loud when the windows were down.  The visor helps to eliminate the unwanted noise. It is also nice to block some rain and to be able to leave the windows cracked when it is hot out.  They are attractive.  My Father-in-Law wanted to know where he could purchase these for his truck.  Looking to buy some for him.
B009AQTOP2|5|good light will buy again
B00ROVNR94|1|Not as advertised, this was a tough fit when trying to install. It seemed way to big, definitely not OEM equiv. Had to take out immediately after installing as it did not hold pressure. Returned and purchased mid-grade as opposed to low end model and it did the trick. Don't waste your time with this product
B00EC0YD1G|3|The good...<br />The mirror fitted perfectly. Well packaged. Delivered on time.<br />The bad....<br />Quality of mirror was bad.  Reflection is of poor quality.
B00NOBRRXU|5|Super easy to install just plug n play and install under seat, took less than 15 minutes. It is already programmed for Stage 1 mods. A must have for the CRF250L if you get exhaust and open up the airbox, really gives it some awesome power and very easy to change settings.
B000M5ZXDM|5|Quality product.  I like the adjustable speed.  Anyone who says this weighs too much is just not used to a real buffer.
B008LXYSTM|1|No acid
B001U86FQE|5|great
B00H873X8E|5|Well made and fits perfectly just as it is designed.  Installation took all of 30 seconds.  It took longer to open the box.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Super Bright!
B00KTIUNPU|2|I purchased this remote to replace one of my factory remotes for my '06 Cadillac DTS. It was a rather straight forward setup procedure that took about 3 minutes. Initially the remote worked flawlessly although the connectable distance away from my vehicle was shorter than the factory piece. After 2 or 3 months of use the graphics started to wear and fade (not really a deal breaker but just a little surprising when compared to the dealer provided item). 1 month ago it was very noticeable that the distance from the car was growing shorter. I assumed the battery was starting to weaken. It got to the point where I needed to be no more than 5 feet from the vehicle for the remote to work. I replaced the battery with a new one and was disappointed to discover it functioned exactly the same way....I needed to be right next to the car for it to work. I now have a completely useless plastic key fob. Since my vehicle has an auto start feature, it was nice to be able to start the car from the comfort of my home.  I gave this 2 stars only because it worked marginally well for about 3 months. It was straight downhill from there. The remote was not abused in any way, never wet, never damaged, but was used 5 days a week to and from work. I would have expected more longevity from this item....I guess the old adage is very true.....You get what you pay for!
B000W0WSPI|2|Does not fit Duramax like the description tells the consumer. Well built tool but it it did not work for the job that Amazon says it will- so the rating is more reflective of Amazon's fitment tool then of the tool itself. I wish I had dug deeper into other reviews before ordering.
B006Q6P6UG|5|These are expensive but the only CARB approved headers for the Nissan VQ40DE.
B000C57YQG|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues.
B00DKQ36T8|5|Fit my 2003 evo 8.<br />This is the bigger knob not the smaller one.
B000CAZUCG|5|Fits perfectly on an 85' MR2 (AW11). The installation can be a big pain in the butt though.<br /><br />To install the boot easily I recommend flipping the end of the boot inside out (after getting the boot over the inner tie rod). It's a bit tough to turn it inside out, but it can be done. Once you do that, turn the steering wheel all the way to the left, and the back off by about 180º. This will push the boot up against the lip of the steering rack that the boot needs to get fitted on, but gives you enough room to unroll the boot onto it. There's not much room to work with while under the car, but if you use your fingers to unroll one part of it you can hold it in place while working around the whole boot. Best of luck!<br /><br />On a side note, the zip ties that come with it are great but don't make the usual click sound most zip ties make, and they also can't be loosened. I recommend putting the zip ties on after you have the boot fully installed.
B003UQYZGQ|5|It was fine.
B003VKGRGC|5|Fit and worked perfectly
B0002BGELQ|5|Does what its supposed too.
B00XZ9N5XC|5|Arrived on time thankyou because I needed bad works great even better than my factory remote
B0006GF5SK|5|We have a dock house with a porta potty for our dock house which we have to bring home to dump in our toilet at home, gross, but using the Walex blue packs it is not bad.  Walex blue packs have a very nice smell which over rides any other smell.  We use the septic toilet paper & with these the paper just disintegrates.  The scent of the packs smell really good & makes this job bearable.  And with amazon prime I get it fast when I need it.
B000E4LW4A|5|quickly shipped, was exactly as described, can't really speak to heating aspect as is early August but very happy with whole experience.
B00W4B54GS|5|good products . I had just to go to Home depot to ask them to cut the key . Which they nicely did it for free . Then a visit to Chrysler dealer to ask them to program one of the two keys because I had only one original . They did it for 60$ . I program myself the last wit the two others and the job was done ! Now I've 3 keys and for only 100 $ !
B00KMMOOSA|5|Great
B00KGIE0F2|4|Perfect!
B007TY0G1I|5|Easy to install, perfect fit; looks great!
B000BQSIWK|5|excelent
B001N72FES|5|Super simple, but super effective.  Worked great on my boat battery with the marine posts.
B004V3QBS2|5|This part was received 2 days or so days after order was placed and i am very happy.
B00H1IGBOS|5|It was a simple job. The replacement part works well and the light over the drivers switch is brighter than the OEM. I would recommend this highly.
B00E1JMIWY|5|Fits almost perfect.  A little short on the sides and length of my windshield of my '15 forte5.  But still works well.  We also have one for an optima and it fits more snug.  Also to thick to fit between the seat but fits fine and out of site on the back shelf
B00BHLBYQU|5|It was cut very well and was very easy to put into the car, I'm very happy with it
B00PG9XVJC|5|You may want to order two sets depending on the number of drawers your chest has.
B007GLCO3W|1|I Used these on my three week old Mazda and it left horrific stains on every surface that they were used on including the dashboard and side door panels.  Fortunately Kirkland baby wipes removed most of the discoloration but it is still evident. Customer service told me to try Dawn and warm water.  Never again!!
B00EZUL6ZY|4|Good item, great price.  I just like the one piece back seat floor piece for max protection
B002L7C3IC|5|Great replacement
B007FHSDM8|4|Worth 20$ 100%. Bolts on easys and works correctly. Only thing I suggest it on the actual lid that you would twist on and off to add gas. There is an o ring on it and I'd take it off they come loose over time and will end up in your tank! Just take it off, it still will work correctly.
B00YQ4FJM0|5|Excellent
B003E1O9ZE|5|did the job
B000F285EG|4|Holds the handle just fine but again you think it would fit better
B00A66GYDA|5|Work like a charm, found the problem with car/  Perfect 10  Glad I bought at Amazon.
B00267PZUK|5|So glad this tool is available, priced around to have spark plugs replaced and was quoted $450. Did it myself for the cost of plugs and my time. Saved $350 dollars.
B00U3D8V64|5|It's a sticker, so there's not much to write but I will say, it sticks very well. I haven't noticed any peeling.
B0007O8S4Y|5|Simply amazing and easy to install! I've never put anything like this in a vehicle in my life, and it only took about an hour.  The kids love the faces too - first thing they did was run and put their hands all over them... and they are hearty enough to survive the onslaught of toddler-dom.  Great learning experience, and the lights work great with the grill-guard.
B00BMRRXSM|5|I ordered these to take on our RV trips and they work great.
B0041TOQ92|5|Worked just fine in 2013 Chevy Sonic
B00I2Q5I10|5|As described
B00EA0ZB7I|5|I'm using these as overhead lighting for my baja buggy. They work great and look good on the roll cage. Current draw is much less than incandescent lamps and so is the amount of heat they generate.
B0002UEPVI|5|This is an excellent adhesive for wet areas. I used this adhesive to reattach a bath-fitter towel rack that I could not figure out how to get to adhere once it fell off the wall after installation. The towel rack originally had a foam tape, which I could not find anywhere.  I coated the back of the rack with this stuff, taped the towel rack to the wall for a day or two with painters tape, then when I removed the painters tape, it stayed firmly adhered. Tugging on it proved it was up there for good. So happy to have found this!
B00MAG6RMM|4|I got these lights to use as the indicator/city lights on my sedan.  They work great and add that luxury look to my car without looking cheesy at all.  Overall, they're a great purchase and I look forward to seeing how long they last.
B00K0MMP8S|5|Very pleased with the availability, price and timeliness of delivery.  Would definitely use this again.  Product worked perfectly
B000C5YCZ2|5|i like the brand
B000F13J2U|5|Dashmat is a great company, I've had multiple mats for various cars through the years.. this one is just as great as any of them has been! It fits my Dodge Spirit's dashboard like a glove and will surely protect it through some more years to come!!
B0006HLT34|5|for serious racers, this belts rocks
B0002SRCMO|4|OEM parts for the low, low gotta love it.
B00UEMH5L6|5|These are the bomb fit like a glove no problem with install saved a ton of money put them on my 2015 wrangler follow instructions make sure surface of grill is clean they provided a isopropyl wipe they stuck on excellent 👍🏻
B000F5HVN4|5|My robinair a/c leak detector was not working. Kept giving false readings, off the scale. Took a chance on this replacement tip and the detector works great again. If your detector goes off the scale as soon as you turn it on, might just be a bad tip.
B00OA66IG0|5|This kits works just as described on my 3,100psi DeWalt pressure washer. Lots of suds that really got the pickup clean with absolutely no intervention by my hands (you are not going to get showroom shine without adding in some hand washing once the suds are on, but for a quick wash it did a great job).<br /><br />Many claim the quick connect is universal. It is not. I initially tried to use this on an electric power washer (Ryobi 2000 PSI) but the quick connect was slightly different and this kit would not attach. I then tried the kit on my Ryobi 3100-PSI 2.5-GPM gas pressure washer as it still had fuel in it - again it did not fit. When I tried it on the DeWalt it was a perfect fit. (yes I own 3 pressure washers - the electric for my wife as she hates to start gas engines, the DeWalt for me, and the gas Ryobi was a gift).<br />The quick connect looks very similar, but have minor differences in where the lip starts. Granted both the ones this would not fit were made by Ryobi, so maybe it is a Ryobi thing. Both Ryobi's are less than 2 years old. After discovering this anomaly, I tried using the spray jets supplied with each pressure washer in different washers. The DeWalt jets only worked in the DeWalt, the Ryobi jets worked in either Ryobi.<br />Wish I could offer more advice. If you have a Ryobi, I'd check the return policy before ordering.
B00IESMAOO|5|I was very happy with this purchase my daughter loves Hello Kitty and it looks great on the dashboard of her car .
B00DJ5KEF4|4|Works good.
B00D75KZ28|4|look good .fit is good except I forgot to check length needed. just a bit short for my kz550 but I can rig a spacer and it will be perfect.
B0002M9QRE|5|2000 XJ great upgrade great quality product, also replaced coils springs, shocks, tires, and upgraded to H4 headlights with relays see full review and photos under Moog CC782 coil springs
B00SY3XYI0|3|Not overly impressed.
B00317952S|4|The smaller digits should be bigger and the trip meter is real slow , good piece otherwise
B0028JQYPG|4|They're easy to adjust and plenty sturdy for holding up my Honda Fit.
B000CB1WK4|5|Purchased for 1996 Infiniti G20 as part of a normal regular tuneup. Super high quality part, which worked great. Definately will buy again for my next tune up.
B00FEZMVDU|5|Excellent
B00II1D8OI|1|Large size. But not worth any star not to mention the seller to the size of the product.<br />Very very bad
B009W997X6|5|Perfect addition to any motorcycle garage. Would buy it again without hesitation.
B006ZXDPZS|5|Worked well.
B003YJ8TVQ|5|Fast shipping.  Great product - works well - great price.
B00KQCMG4U|5|Excellent product
B006RJVMMI|1|Paint arrived within the specified time frame. However I could not get it to flow out of the bottle. It was already thick and I think, going bad. I just threw it out in the trash. Not worthwhile to return it.
B008SBW8AI|5|Works well on my 2015 Ram 2500 and is relatively easy to install- much easier then using a winch bumper.
B000CIR54E|4|Nice quality v-belt for a good price.  I used it to replace my John Deere mower 48&#34; deck drive belt.  JD OEM belts are way over priced.
B0011FI6E0|5|Got them they fit perfect great product
B006MX8196|4|front seats fit fine the back seat not so easy to keep on but they do protect the seats from the dogs
B004SRA60U|5|Working fine
B00VCOO9SC|4|good switch<br />backlight well
B000GZQP08|5|Recommended by a Harley Davidson service department, tried it, really like it. Will continue to use.
B0079QH10U|5|Good product
B002M6CJ40|5|Worked out just fine.
B004LEKT9S|5|Pipe is very nice & fast shipping. Only wish it was a little cheaper.
B00P1GDDLG|5|PERFECT FIT AND GREAT PRICE!!!
B00RE6KV48|4|I have some leather pieces that my grandfather made. They were starting to get a little dry and brittle so I started exploring options for bringing back some of their suppleness. There seem to be a lot of arguments over whether to use oils or animal fats or chemical laden stuff. I wanted something fairly natural and ease of use helps as well. I saw this stuff and was able to get it for a steep discount for testing purposes and an honest and unbiased review so I jumped on it. I like that it is natural and my leather just drank it up. the surface would be dry by the time I finished the piece so the coats went rather quickly. I thought I was going to end up using the whole bottle on my purse but between the two pieces I used it on, I only used about half the bottle.<br /><br />My pieces have new life! They are more flexible and have more character. A huge plus for me is that this stuff does not stink either. I was a little nervous about trying something on my grandpa's leather stuff. He passed away a couple years ago and he was my hero. I can never replace these items.<br /><br />I am a little nervous about the purse. It did darken my items quite a bit. My purse much more so than the Bible cover I used it on. Like, super dark. I was not expecting that. It was a job though, that once you start, there is no going back because the color contrast was just a LOT. I included images to show. I'm not sure if it was the type of leather or the age or what. It was quite dramatic considering the Leather Rescue is a clear concoction. The directions do say that it will lighten back up over time so I am really hoping for that. I don't care if it is darker than it was, but at the level it is now, it is hard to see the beautiful wild roses all over the purse. They were kinda my grandpa's trademark.<br /><br />All in all, I like how my leather items feel as for suppleness and the life this product has added. I didn't give a full five stars due to the dramatic coloring. I'm not sure how normal that is as I've never used leather conditioning products before. I would purchase again though as my items are much more flexible and I believe this product to have extended their life cycle by a lot. :)normal that is as I've never used leather conditioning products before.

B006PIAGCI|5|Removed some stubborn scratches and oxidation from a 2000 Expedition. Highly recommended.
B00KGEIX9K|5|Actually does what it says, looks like it looks, and is Ok value for the money.
B000LG9M1Q|4|Works great and no complaints (set up worked like a charm - read instructions thoroughly), but it doesn't seem to be made by Toyota. I compared it to my other remote, and it shows no indication that it is OEM. I'd say it is a cheaper plastic - but the guts are what matters most to me, and they work flawlessly, so far.
B002OUMVWY|5|Good hose, very easy to install - great fittings, easy to clean and easy to store, as it collapses pretty well into approximately 4-5 foot long.
B000CMHNY2|4|Well made but the finish was'nt as good as it could be.The paint was chipping off when I took it out of the box. It should be powder coated or have a Berliner finish. A little pricey for what you get.
B001KR3HJS|1|Did not fit vehicle - wrong thread adaptors for my vehicle.
B000C18Q44|3|fast shipping but only 12 volt won't work on bj40 crusier, 24 volt
B00XKN6O2M|1|Terrible, broke on first use. 3 tooth broke off. The metal appeared to be poor quality. The center attachment to the wrench was also weak. Save yourself the headache and search for a stronger product.<br /><br />BTW, my filter cap was not over tighten. I stopped by my local Autozone parts store to purchase a similar tool for 9.99 and it took it off without damaging the filter cap or tool.
B00ARLISJM|5|Good quality mats.  Fit quality is 9/10.  Some spots do not lay perfect, but not bad.
B00651CB50|4|This antenna improved my 99 Ranger's radio quality immensely, receives more radio stations with a clearer sound quality and now white noise in the background. the only thing is that I would like to see it be a little stiffer, when I drive over 45mph it starts to look like a  black banana attached to my hood.
B00VZH418O|5|Good  price and great service.
B006FRQZOW|5|A+
B007ZDDUCK|4|worked well, thank you!
B0002SR4Q8|5|Good product, good price and good service.
B0024NSGYS|5|Great item.  Easy to install.
B001NYP6VU|5|Fit in my 2006 mazda tribute.
B00515QUCQ|1|They loosen up and the color fades easily.
B007G83T16|5|Heavy weight and seems well built. I love the long low profile and high 24&#34; lift. I have an old Craftsman that only had an 18&#34; lift that took 22 full pumps, but the Arcan makes full lift in 8 full pumps. I have a Kwiklift that needs a low profile, high lift floorjack to raise and lower it, and this jack works perfect with it. Also, there is a foam cushion on the lower half of the jack arm that protects the vehicle side or bumper while pumping the jack. The 2 piece jack arm is installed with a single bolt at the jack, so can be removed for transporting. Since I've only had the jack a short time, I can't comment on reliability, but as of now I'm very happy with the choice I made. Great deal at $219 with Amazon Prime free shipping too!
B00E0MMJ08|5|Stopped my surging and was easy to install
B00M284QLW|5|The dealership wanted to charge $75 for the part plus another $75 for labor.  We installed this part on our own with no problems.  Saved on the part and labor!
B000JFJM14|5|Worked great!
B004TMHF8K|1|Worst product ever. Once it came in the mail, i tried it, and it did not work. BUYER BEWARE! Do not buy
B00230G8N8|5|Very good, would use again.
B00YAX8X6Q|5|Good product.
B0049MTHOU|5|Fit just right on my equinox lt 2012. If my welded  nuts on my frame werent rusted on the inside I would have had this on in 15 minutes. Was a little nervous about the  1 1/4 inch but am able to tow a dual jetski trailer with the pwcs fully fueled without a problem.
B002RBZMMQ|2|I bought this set as a gift for my daughter's Dodge Journey. The front seats fitted ok but we could not secure them so the seat covers would always slip off. The back seat covers did not fit at all.  Before I purchased the seat covers I called Amazon.com. to ask if they would fit my daughters car and they told the seat covers would fit her Dodge Journey. While I was installing the front seat covers they ripped because the ties that secure it was too small.
B005GHB5U6|4|Great mask but fogs up my glasses, think nose hole needs to be bigger or something
B004RNOVTM|5|Nice hose appears to be well made, and was easy to install.
B000ETQMIQ|3|I should've calculated size better. Wish it was a little smaller to fit my car. Must be for large vehicles.
B00OMSUOMK|4|4 stars only because it blocks one of the letters on my license plate, which is against the law. Great sturdy material, I put it on my keys instead, and I love it!
B00E2548HU|5|Took a long time to figure out how to uninstall and reinstall the first one (rear left spring). Actually thought about canning the whole project. After a little while we got brave and started man handling things and knocked it out pretty quickly. Ended up jacking up the back of the car and applying the spring compressors the best we could manage and then literally kicking the old strutts/springs off the back of the car. To reinstall, we use the jack to help the strutt in place. The front was a breeze. Compressors were only used to remove the old springs, the new springs went on without need of compressors (again the back needed about 2 inches of compression via a floor jack).<br /><br />So enough about the install. The ride quality is fantastic. My base 2009 Matrix didn't have a lot of body roll before but now it's much tighter and handles significantly better in the twisties. Usual bumps and jolts aren't much worse though really bad bumps will hurt a bit. The car is lowered probably 1 inch. With how high the stock Matrix rides, I feel I'm about on par with a honda fit or civic. In fact, since installation a month ago, I haven't scraped on anything and there's some pretty rough roads and such around here.<br /><br />Dollar for dollar, I believe this is the single best performance part for your car. Esp if your car has some worn out springs already.
B0012TZ2CE|5|Save Money buying 2 stroke oil by the gallon.<br />Has big opening to make adding oil easy.<br />Oil ratios and graduations easy to read.<br />Lid seals tight won't leak.
B005BCT1D4|4|It gives the jeep a pretty cool look just be careful when installing them not to over tighten them because the hardware is weak and breaks easily. Otherwise, not a bad product.
B00C7UYX0Y|3|The directions for installing especially the b & w pictures were very very poor. Get you a helper with a little experience.  Look pretty good once done.
B008CXYOVS|5|I love it
B00XWDYUXU|5|great price works great
B0013GAPE6|2|Originally bought this to help my toddler reach the sink. A little too big for my bathroom.
B00F202C68|5|excellent product.
B0015YBYCS|5|i used it to cover my garden hoses that are expose to the sun all day easy to pu on and off
B0022ZV3J8|5|this filter looks Trick on my 2015 Yamaha YZ 250 2 stroke, one of the biggest issues with Racing Carburetors is an Enemy called DIRT! not only does this Filter keep the Dirt out but looks Darn Good doing it. I Highly Recommend.
B007AUY85G|2|Lettering on bottom to big.
B00230HTKE|5|Worked great with my Yamaha Wave Venture 760 jetski to flush sand out of the cooling system
B007ED84XG|5|Love it! Exactly as described and fits perfectly in my Cruze.
B00I548SZW|4|These bars look great and installed easily.  the only problem I had was that not all the washers were included. they gave the correct amount of washers, just too many of the small washers and not enough of the larger ones.
B0000UZ528|5|good
B00BTGSGFK|3|I was surprisingly unimpressed with these. In my first use, the seam ripper and the applicator was essentially destroyed. Before that, it fid perform fine, but it wasn't really the best for the job. I was applying CG jetseal like they recommend.
B00CMUD8E6|5|yes
B00E0IKHI8|5|VERY fast shipping. So far...after about 500 or so miles still looks brand new (as it should). Nothing much else you can say, unless it starts to wear fast.
B002L29FEM|1|I tried this on my shower doors and it did not remove hard water stains. Will be returning.
B00JK324Z2|5|Good set of cables!  My car has not needed any so far but now I don't have to worry about being stranded as these will be in my trunk!!  And a bag to keep them in - bonus!!  Arrived on time & are exactly as described.
B003TTVGZC|5|Been using these for years now in my 8 3/4 Mopars.
B00EKEGRVS|2|Broke after a week I received it.. :(
B004A2BBOI|5|This set of OEM filters work great and come with both filters and o-ring for installation.  I have purchased these now twice as the dealer wanted $180 for filter change.  Takes maybe 20 mins to perform yourself.  See my write up below!<br /><br />Changing frame rail filter:<br /><br />Remove sensor harness, and lossen filter housing with a 1 1/4&quot; socket or 32mm or use a strap wrench.  I highly recommend a strap wrench so you don't shear the plastic housing.  Turn 3 TIMES then losses yellow drain valve and drain into suitable container.  Remember to lube new o-ring and re install everything.<br /><br />Chasing engine filter:<br /><br />Remove the fuel line keepers on both lines and by pushing down the yellow tabs and the keeper will go down out of the way, the other fuel line will come off by squeezing both white tabs inward then remove.  Loosen the 7mm nut and turn and lift the fuel filter and re install in reverse order.<br /><br />Prime filters by turning the key a few times before starting.
B000VHZHBO|4|fits the bill, nice and heavy duty, specialized tool for not much money
B00FDGVMVW|5|I've seen a lot of reviews mentioning that the reception is poor.  I can say that mine picks up AM/FM radio as well as or better than the whip antenna that came with my Dodge Caravan.  Now I get great reception and I don't have to worry about the car wash scratching up my van with my own antenna!<br /><br />The only 'bad' thing I had was neither of the rubber ring blanks fitted the gap between the antenna and the base so there's a small gap between them.  Barely noticeable and doesn't affect functionality at all.
B00R8LBX2I|5|exact fit for 99 mustang v6, great price and works nicely. Would buy again from seller.
B000C8T96Q|5|Perfect fit!
B00EFFY46W|1|It broke in the car wash
B00FTNO8C4|4|I'm impressed and that's saying a lot as I generally have no use for made in China junk! These are better than the G.M. originals!
B00BI3WLHS|5|it's adorable
B000C7O9ZI|4|Still works great  after a year...
B0002SR88C|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B00H554R98|5|This is great stuff and I have used it on my RV roof for years.  The self-leveling is the best, and it flows into a nice bead. Just clean the area moderately and dry before applying.<br /><br />I will say that the tubes I received were not the full color retail packaging, but rather the commercial tube.  The shipping company informed me it was the same product, just different packaging. (retail is #501; commercial is 502)
B00N0IHMXM|5|Necessary  tool for all campers as long as you have a drill/driver that will handle it
B00XKY89AG|4|Thank you my product came right on time. I no longer have that clutter in my trunk.
B001U7E030|5|I had to modify the frame to fit my r- pod, but it works just fine. Heavy duty and a good value.
B001HKZHIW|4|It works good. No more 3&#34; hose, and all the supports needed. I love how it's so easy to setup, and unhook, and store. I use quick disconnects on all the connections. I'm also using 5/8&#34; hose. My black tank empties in about 3 1/2 minutes.<br /><br />Just understand that you can't park for an extended period of time without pumping down the gray water tank. I can go about 2 1/2 days on the gray water before having to dump. You can't sit, parked for days, hooked up to a sewer, and have the gray water drain out by gravity. The pump has to run to empty the gray water.<br /><br />I'm adding some pics of my hookups. I made the sewer adapters up myself. I also use a short piece of clear hose to see whats going on while<br />the tanks empty.
B00JS3E754|4|the  instructions should tell me 2 check are pressure  tire was shipped with 28lbs  2 use on the car tire must b @ 60lbs
B004PKSUGC|5|Fast shipping.  Works great!
B004TTAR9W|1|Bought for my ML320, 2000. Pump had noises and on low rpms steering was a bit heavy. On the 1st day may be for about 20-30 miles run pump probablu get better, on the second day again worsened and now on the third day pump has new different and louder noises and steering on low rpms become almost impossable. I am afraid tomorrow morning it will stops working at all :( And I will be forced to buy new pump anyway.<br />I will update review if anything changes
B001LMWA6I|5|Does the job nicely
B00DUH2T7C|3|Smelled really good for a couple of days. After a week the smell faded.
B00NJ43SSU|5|Great
B00EVQIBQY|5|Great wallet
B002RFW4Z0|4|Gives you a slight edge in sound from my experience.
B00IZLFF10|5|This went on very nicely and even the pointy edges came out straight. there is no clear square left taking away from it. You actually remove every part of the sticker but the 'M'. Very nice job. I got a sailor moon decal similar to it because of how well it came out.
B003O75N30|5|Works perfectly. Keeps thing high and dry and plenty of room.
B00QMWQROI|5|I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  The OxGord® 4pc Full Set Heavy Duty &#34;DELUXE&#34; Carpet Floor Mats fit very well in my husband's Honda.  I like that they come in a variety of colors so yo can choose the best one for your needs. There are 2 back seat floor mats, one for the drivers side and one for the passenger side. They were very easy to install and gave his car a new and fresh look. Not only that, but now his car carpets are protected from getting messy and damaged. The OxGord® carpet floor mats have all-weather protection against sleet, ice, snow, and rain. Great quality for the price.  Highly recommend purchasing these carpet floor mats by OxGord®.
B000BAV602|5|I found a bad scrape in the rear side panel that would have cost $650 to respray. I used this product and was able to get good results, I found 3 coats were needed to level out the paint as is does shrink as it drys. I went in 2 hour intervals originally, but found 4 hours worked better for me. I had a silver car so it didn't completely hide the scratch, but it's not noticeable from a distance and will protect the car from rust so I'm happy with the product.
B003SKCARK|5|I love it, and using for all my leather shoes.
B004ETK0AI|5|Handy to keep stuff off the floor and seats
B009FUF6DM|2|Not so thrilled about these cloths. They just aren't holding up like the ones I bought at Costco. I would not order again.
B00Q2HTHTK|4|Works great! Fixed the first vehicle I tried it on in a matter of minutes. It does have some limitations on what data can be read but bang for the buck it's a good buy.
B00S4HFNXK|5|Inexpensive bumpers are a nice size to stash under a boat seat and use when tethering to a pier. Picked up a few for our deck boat. Seem to be decently made.
B00200SBAY|5|Cleaned radiator well and good price.
B0097MYLI4|5|actually in use.
B00JUWL9X6|4|Works as designed.
B00AQZANCO|5|oem perfect
B000E32290|5|met my needs - item is as described
B0010GG7YG|5|I am now a hero in the house, moms windows work again.
B001OCXI2U|5|Worked great fast shipping
B00521K7IC|5|They were a direct fit on my 07 Monte Carlo SS 5.3 definitely made a difference better throttle response
B00GBW81IY|5|Looks great! Put it on the back of my vehicle
B00ESBOL3E|5|very bright
B00BIL1EW8|5|Slick and not super long like some<br />Bobber style for sure!
B0057FXQUO|5|Works great and matches my dog's Julius K9 IDC-POWERHARNESS harness. I wish it came in pink for my female dog's harness.
B0028SH6PE|5|Great for touch ups or cleaning a slightly dirty car.  Gives a good wet shine.  Smells good too
B003VAWLBC|2|The screws that come with it were in a bag attached to the back. All 4 screws had come out and 2 were left in the box. They were WAY too short to do any good, so off to the hardware store to buy 4 screws of sufficient length.<br /><br />In hindsight, I would not have bought this handle if I could have seen it first.<br /><br />I guess that's the risk you take when you buy online.
B001DRN98E|5|perfec
B00OQDCWZI|3|Don't always stay connected
B0038B4BT4|1|caused cruise control to not function
B009UKUUWE|5|It gets with the program. Its variable speed & easy to handle. I buffed out an old Buick with the orange pad and mild polish. The clear coat was oxidized and cleaned right up. Then used the same polish with a white pad. No swirl marks and Its slick especially after a coat of jet seal. Sure beats the old rotary buffers for time & finish.
B00R7JIIMY|5|Fit perfect and look great on my truck.
B007KA7PP6|5|Great fit
B002DOME1E|4|Much better than anything else offered. They offer ones with clips and the others don't work at all. These straps work perfectly, I've used it like for a couple of months now and it has never failed, it keeps my bike from moving and I couldn't ask for more. The only thing is they are pretty large, it would be nice to get a couple large ones and a couple smaller ones.
B002OVDEGK|3|Our slide in is only 1350 lbs, so these are rugged enough. The mounting to our 2000 F150 was a challenge. I do not know how the local RV dealer would have done it, but there was no way anybody was getting the nut on from below, as is shown in the Brophy installation video. I opted to use a metal hole saw to provide access from inside the bed and that worked really well. All in all, it took me less than 1/2 an hour to install and we were on the road. If I had to do it again, I would opt for the non-permanent mounting version.
B000P0VTAK|4|Works well
B00DE9KY1O|5|Black magic protectant is the best in my book, great smelling too. I cant understand the negative reviews of this fine product.  I buy it by the case and use it on everything.
B000HBM45Q|4|They hold up well so I ordered another box. No glove is perfect but these worked decently with greases, oils, paint and solvents.
B000BZZEXM|5|Work great and fit great. They do come with hardware.
B00YMJIZNE|1|Lights no longer work, mother board burned up
B00HMG8QHE|2|Installed this unit and it worked great, for 1 month & 1 day.  Now it doesn't make a peep.  Ad says 'all weather usage' but it ain't!  Debating as to try and return this, but outside the Amazon 30 return, so may just chuck it!  Don't install this where it'll get wet, so that means inside an enclosure, and that will make it a LOT quieter, defeating the purpose of it all together.  Now guess will look elsewhere for this, as I was having trouble like other customers with people walking behind the truck.  This is quote from another customer, & it fits my issue exactly &#34; I was consistently having issues with some adults and children walking behind my truck, typically at Wal-Mart, when I was backing out of a parking spot&#34;.
B004P23VQO|4|Like the look and it is well constructed.  Only complaint would be the back window is a bitch to get on.  Even after stretching and wearing it in for a few months.  And it comes with support bars that go right over your head when the Sunrider top is open.  I simply removed that one and it's OK.<br /><br />Oh and the whole tip doesn't just flip down like a standard  top.  The front flips open and you have to remove the back & sides.  (like I said are not at all easy to get back on)
B009IF1U5M|5|It's work perfect
B00F0M3KGY|5|Nice brakets and they were a significant improvement over my original ones.  I can see much better since they are on the side of the pipes versus centered on them.  Since I can only do 25mph, I need to ride the shoulder alot and want to keep tabs on traffic in my area.
B000E28EIE|5|I put this on a '96 f350 diesel truck and was very pleasantly surprised to find that it bolted up to the factory holes in the frame without me having to drill anything at all. The design and fit are identical to the hitch that came on the truck when it was new.
B000ZEON90|2|Very poor quality transmission and a lot of static.
B000H4G256|5|its so cool, good product
B000CQOIR8|5|its on truck less then 40 mins and works like it should thank you for the fast shipping
B004TDNUQ0|5|This &#34;OE&#34; brake line matched up to my 2003 Chevy Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck.<br />My only dislike about the brake line is the included copper washers. Would have preferred steel.
B000RUFBA2|3|Other then the fact that the bolts did not fit that came with it. It is durable but would of been nice not to have to search for bolts that fit!!
B0057FK080|5|The filter is the same but the foam tape along the sides is slightly thicker so the filter fits very snugly, other that that very good
B002XM58A0|4|Only bad thing is key cant be removed until the lock is turned back to lock position. With four locks on panel ....makes it tough to unlock all locks.
B0041WI5O6|4|Nice set of decals, but I would recommend going to Moon Equipped website, and order this exact same product for $5.00.
B00E1SOAO4|5|These are so much better than the cheap crap I've inflicted before on my poor car. Look good, ride with no vibration or shake under braking.  Really good stopping power, too.
B007ZGBLNW|5|I put these as headlights on my mini baja buggy. Very good construction and much better than the incandescent lamps they replaced. Less current draw and heat generated !
B002TD0XXU|5|Excellent
B000B66UU2|5|Perfect fit.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Used other deflectors, they just absorb heat and burn your hand when putting them away. This one does NOT burn at all and I'm in Arizona dealing with 115 degrees as of today. Putting it away is easy, just twist them toward you and it folds nicely into 12&#34; diameter circle, fits perfectly in side holder of door.
B000BWFR4G|5|Very happy with purchase. Not complaints made well
B001EAQTRI|5|I replaced a good home theater receiver with a good digital mixer and power amp to drive my man cave sound system.  The primary music source is a laptop computer.  The mixer/power amp combo is notoriously susceptible to ground loops and other sources of static interference and it turns out my laptop produces plenty of the static interference.  I could &#34;listen&#34; to my mouse cursor move across the screen!  I wasn't sure if this &#34;ground loop noise isolator&#34; would work on the static (which is not ground loop noise) but to my delight it turned my system dead quiet.  A very nice bit of magic for $9!
B0126KGWFS|5|Works great
B00PNXF45A|5|In this video, I cover the installation of three different types of Bartact (TrekArmor) paracord grab handles. The front (TAOGHUPBB), rear (TAOGHRPBB), and headrest (TAOGHHPBB).  I was really impressed with the quality and robustness of these handles, especially compared to the Jeep Wrangler JKU factory handles. They come in many colors, but I am installing the black ones at this time.  You can find them at http://www.bartact.com!<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgeh_FddjpQ
B00KIFJ5VM|5|Perfect on my vehicle ! 👍🏻love it !
B000CGFMKK|5|Excellent
B004HMBK5G|5|works great.. keeps the belt from digging into my neck
B002LS08U6|1|I got a pair a few weeks ago and they already are falling apart, I sent a message about the gloves and nobody got back ,it just goes to show how things are delt with.
B00HFWYZO8|4|should have gotten the dark color...gets dirty fast
B00KL3ALGO|5|Window shades work as described. I like that it comes off and on so easily and I don't have to deal with those annoying suction cups.
B0025OITFM|5|Brake pads were just as described and arrived in a timely fashion.<br />Would buy again from this dealer.
B002B4Y0F4|5|great gift
B00W58P1AY|4|they work well in my trailer, however they are not quit as bright as the originals
B004W4OQDM|1|The product is not a plug and play application like website promised.
B006RXH3JK|5|The quality of this is very nice. Not plastic like others.
B00BFE3H6O|5|Exact OEM replacement part. I would leave it out somewhere for a while as the part has a very strong rubbery smell that goes away after a day or so.
B00ASY2614|5|This worked great.  The only issue is the connector for the relays is hidden.  Dont mistake the already connected harness that uses the same connectors and disconnect it to connect this one.  This is not the right way to do it.  Keep looking for the disconnected connector, took me a few minutes to find it.
B007CISDMA|5|I have no complaints. Great product!
B005G3LA2I|5|Works as designed and didn't fall off in 7 years !!!
B00F676FH4|5|OEM...its the real deal...yes I recommend..
B006H3HM8C|5|Fits perfectly thank's to the seller.
B00JDPZPTY|4|Slipstreamer windshield really made a nice change to my bike.  The order process was pain free. My order arrived quickly. I would recommend  this product.
B007TY1CAW|1|Put this on my 93 gmc and it doesn't fit. Not sure what year this is for, but it definitely doesn't fit a 93, 1500 5 on floor. The case from a 94 Sonoma seems to fit just fine.
B00CDJ8RLU|5|This is amazing and great quality.
B0006B3WSU|5|excellent fit  works greate and nice and shiny....
B009FU5INA|4|Seem to handle well so far on my older volvo
B000BTLMNO|5|Easy installation!  I used a ball joint press (c-clamp style) to get the center bushing in, but a regular c-clamp would have worked too.  So far they are quiet and the ride has improved greatly.  They came with plenty of grease which was nice---be sure to use it.  I've had great luck with Energy bushings in the past these have lived up to my expectations.  (2000 VW Jettta TDI)<br /><br />Fwiw I removed the entire axle which wasn't much more work and it made removing/installing the bushings a lot easier in the long run.  Getting the old bushings out of the axle was a pain---good luck.  Be sure to use anti-sieze on the mounting bolts in case you ever have to change them again.
B000GBGNRW|5|Fit my Aztek perfectly.  Easy installation.  Word of caution: the Aztek upper lift gate is extremely heavy when not fully supported by the hydraulic lifters.  Make sure you have something with which you can support the lift gate (say, a short 2x4), because you must install the lifters with the lift gate fully open.  I recommend installing one lifter at a time rather than removing both old ones first.  Probably should have someone around for spotting in case your support doesn't work you planned.
B0002JMSHM|3|OK
B002KR38WS|5|Every toolbox needs one of these.
B001MPY4ZO|4|OK
B005VTSWW8|4|perfect replacement
B00EDRA3FI|5|Clean, easy way to mount a clock on a bike.
B00SM5GEXC|1|Way too small for a 4 door  vehicle, on my 2012 camry it only reach to the windshield it only cover half the car.
B003V5HKTA|4|I only know it fits and looks OK.  Have not installed yet.
B0032J1KAK|5|as advertised. thank you
B0074DH8EM|5|I got to test this vest on July 10, 2015 on a California interstate freeway at 65 mile per hour! I hit the pavement after a couch fell off a truck in front of me. I did pray before I left home so must give God the ultimate credit but sure glad he had me buy this vest!! Don't get on a horse or motorcycle without one!
B00737GY3U|5|Just as described and depicted.
B00F1FKSD8|5|Everyone of my vehicles and motorcycles have K&N they are a must have!  Quick delivery!
B00DD09HW6|5|Fits perfect, easy to install and i must have item.
B0049QQJWO|5|Came quickly and arrived undamaged covered in packing grease. Fit great works great. I'm now cruising my 51 everday now. Definitely worth it, I couldn't find one cheaper when including shipping. Would buy again.
B0009IBJAS|1|It stop working before it charged one battery
B009VYWIMO|1|This wireless product has a very short range so it does not produce a consistent picture - fuzzy. Seems to have signal interference issues with overhead power lines. Best of all the product completely failed after 30 days so I have to try to send for warranty and that probably will not happen.
B00IISKVV4|5|Great price ,fast shipping & good  product .
B002IZBMXO|5|I actually bought two power packs. The other major brand had a loose pin that damaged/burned the motor harness causing an internal failure within 20 minutes. The CDI brand I replaced that one with has sturdier connectors and its wiring is tinned like true marine grade whereas the competitor's had plain untinned copper and more fragile connectors. The CDI installed perfectly and is running great! If you have a choice, go with the CDI.
B009X1USAE|5|Fit perfectly and you wouldn't know it wasn't a factory installed item. Very nice addition to the Jeep.
B00KI3UIJ2|5|We recently used these straps on a cross country trip and we were blown away with how thick and strong these straps were. This set is far superior in quality to the original set that actually broke while using! I can't recommend these more.
B00WS41U2S|5|Love it got a lot of like on it!!!
B005N53AM2|4|Cover looks nice. I hate the smell which reeks like any new steering wheel cover. It was much easier to put on than I expected.
B006XDBJXU|3|Basketball came apart upon arrival.  Thanks goodness I had some strong glue to put it back together.  Hopefully it holds as it was a gift.
B00X8RW4D8|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE them!!
B009LN4UHQ|5|work great
B0036ZITE0|5|Installed it in my camper and it has a couple hundred hours of run time.  Easy to install.  Pretty quiet.  Just enough sound to make for undisturbed sleeping. Moves plenty of air in either direction and operates well even in rain unless it's pouring.
B004QMJC1Q|1|cant get latch to release , now sitting on shelf gathering dust
B000VU91SG|5|Good deal on well constructed product
B00F6JU2EE|5|Good and Cheap!

B00UDR4D7G|3|It´s ok but does not fit well
B0068ESCZC|5|My wife and I love this seat.
B001LHXTO0|1|WAS NOT ALL THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
B00G6188EM|5|I was surprised  to see that its actually  really  bright i have a short  video on my ig of what it looks like rolling @tittox54
B00G2114IS|3|The caps are pretty good quality, but the MB emblems on them are just cheap stickers. 1 was crooked & coming off when they came. I was able to put it back on right. Still not bad for $5.
B000YOVISK|3|Rust really easily but for the price  i cant complain feel really sturdy well built put some really good hits  into  them.
B00CQ7XD5O|4|Works good. But, feel like wil damage disk blade.
B001EP0HVM|5|Great product
B00OC2I27A|5|Nice quality and a good looking item.
B005G5R8JU|5|Well worth the money, covers my 07 road glide
B00CFRQRSA|5|Great lift kit.  Easy to install and looks great
B00QUHEUJO|5|Matches the Jeep billet silver nicely
B00801RRIE|4|plastic boot did not fit that well. Bolt hole was different, but no big deal. Other than that is was fine
B003U30IGA|5|Worked flawlessly  on my 2004 Toyota Camry. Easy to install.

B002XYJJTY|5|Perfect fit.
B001D1XKH0|4|Works great
B00BYH6C1E|5|Fantastic!
B00KWCOUFW|5|Awesome quality arrived on scheduled.
B000CIV4QO|3|not the correct part
B00V6XHRGU|1|Battery wasn't charged when received<br />Mighty max battery was difficult to get a response from and had to get Amazon administration involved<br /><br />Slow to deliver also
B002JFEETW|5|Nice shades and perfect fit which is weird since I normally look a little funny.
B009ET14E4|3|The front seat covers fit fairly well but the back left no allowance for seat belts or armrest.  I'll have to cut it up in places. It says to just pop out the seats and attach underneath.  Maybe for a strong young man like in the video.
B001DALUM8|5|Working great, fast shipping
B001DX5M10|5|Came in Delco box and appears to be there exact filter that came from the factory. Car only has 15k miles on it, but bought it about a year ago and was not sure how dirty it was so ordered and glad I did. Appears to be an excellent filter and quick delivery.
B00OMQCR22|5|Awesome
B000C1LW0E|5|This pump works very good. Used it on a diesel<br />Generator with a Kabota engine. Was. Very easy<br />Install .
B00FP0FG86|5|love it anything with my redskins logo is so amazing, but smells great too bonus . I will buy them again for sure.
B006N936NA|5|very good product and cervice
B003L33Q0O|5|There's not enough oil in it!
B008NO5QDQ|1|couldn't find the correct fit
B00MPDSJVC|5|Well made product and quick delivery!
B00306912Y|5|Excellent quality.  They work on my Corolla doors in a satisfactory manner.  Will buy more if needed.
B00BYG72M8|5|worked great on my 2003 tahoe with the 2nd gear servo kit i had to drop the transmission down a little bit to get the new one in but after the shift is much faster and precise
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Love these for the beach. Easy to carry and folds up nicely. Great substantial size. I ended up purchasing two! This would also be great for parks, concerts,etc.
B001SGIDJK|4|SO FAR IS OK
B009DK50PS|5|Looks good!
B007IPL0PY|3|Torn between 5 and zero stars. Seems like a good quality battery, and since the acid ships separate from the battery, it's guaranteed fresh, but this battery doesn't fit a Yamaha Roadstar. Amazon said it did, and I ordered it under this pretense. Amazon gave me a refund, but it doesn't help not being able to ride.
B0062IJOJ2|5|Put these on my 2005 Dodge Ram 2500, fit perfect. Came with all the hardware (multiple styles)
B0097677Z4|5|Got everything way early. Very satisfied.
B005LDBU0U|5|I've used Airhawk products for several years on various motorcycles. I love the product concept and have put over 25k miles riding on an Airhawk. I bought the Airhawk R because I was interested in the claims of tailbone, prostate, and temperature relief. I haven't been able to ride more than about 100 miles on the Airhawk R, but I can say that the moment I sat on it I experienced a tangible difference related to tailbone pressure. It was absent for the most part.<br /><br />If you suffer from tailbone or prostate pain while riding long distance motorcycles I highly recommend this product.
B00VJWZBNO|5|Kyb strut plus are the bomb. Brought the ride hight back up and feels like a new car. Saves time on installation and not using the old saggy springs makes a difference.
B00AQFE47E|5|This item is very well made and the fit and finish are excellent. I couldn't ask for better.
B000EQAJ0G|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '02 Malibu. No issues.
B00FEPXT8Q|2|doesn't work
B00WGPFK4I|4|Great product... seems to &#34;work&#34; as advertised.
B000P7O5DG|5|Great products.  Amazingly fast freezing speed.  Will cool or freeze - not both at the same time.
B00U0HJ26G|5|Thank you
B00KTHXRLS|5|Remote works well for my 2006 Toyota Sienna. I was able to program it myself by using YouTube instructions.
B00F0YASQ2|5|Good product
B0082365AQ|5|I Love IT . !!!<br />  Great Transaction
B00S9TZY8M|4|I was a little disappointed that it is made of plastic, but it looks great.
B0033QQ4VW|5|Kept my Volvo up and running, no complaints here
B00JI9COJE|5|Fits our classic Nova  perfectly.  Glad to see made in USA.
B0049DSVGY|5|It works. Save a bunch of money by going with dorman instead of buying at dealership. Top harness wiring is a little tricky to remove from the one mounted on there but dorman goes in just fine. Just be sure to press in tightly. I will recommend dorman to anyone that runs into the same problem I had. I'm happy with it produce.
B00T36OP76|4|Reason for 4 stars is for two reasons first the installation instructions are not written so as the average person can easily understand them and their illustrations are just as confusing.  Secondly the manner in which the rear nerf bar is attached is quite cumbersome and could have been been a lot easier. (I am mechanic by trade)
B00C704X0E|5|To me it's fits true to size I like the weight ,looks and everything about the helmet . I been using hjc helmet for the past five years .and the fit and finish is far better in my opinion .
B0047DDDT6|5|item just as described, easy to install. be careful with top bolts, easy to &#34;wring off/ break stud&#34;. Ask me how I know, follow tourqe instructions. car rides & drives like new
B00CSX42WY|4|The one for the trunk fit but the hood did not since I ordered the wrong one. But the price was awesome and the shipping was fast and fair.
B0043I5ZXW|2|They fit great and look great, but for some reason are very dim. They do not put out enough light to even notice when you turn them on.
B00CODHTCI|5|Awesome easy install strong many people ask me about them
B00M53A7N0|5|I just purchased this for my 2006 Land Rover LR3 it's a dead ringer for the original I would buy again!
B00AESPJYA|5|I am happy with my purchase :)
B000E4GDYY|4|Works well. easy to install and matches as OEM
B009S1Z9IK|1|Bought two of these. I really wanted the Silver the Hedgehog keychain but it was missing.
B0009IQZH0|5|NICE VALUE
B00OGN9IZU|5|good mats... would buy them again...
B007Y4BL1C|5|Very nice inverter. I am glad I paid a little extra for quality and pure sine wave.
B00W5MG8XY|5|Nice unit good accuracy.
B000VWX2E8|4|Nice sign. Would have liked a bit more color.
B003C016MQ|5|Fit perfectly, worked as advertised.
B00HS5VSH4|5|The brakes and rotors went on easy and the shortened stopping distance is wonderful.  Would definitely use these on other vehicles in the future.
B007TN994O|5|Item was in perfect condition. Fantastic job on protecting the radiator .
B00SE41BDE|5|I purchased these LED lights for my 2014 Fiesta. There isn't any difference in the lighting modules, or whatever they are called, compared to the 2015 model. All seven worked and were easy to install. They are noticeably brighter and white compared to the yellow OEM bulbs. I highly recommend these for every Fiesta owner as they will add a bit more of an upscale look to the car at night, plus they are super bright to see what you're looking for.  The only tip I can give is to look up how to remove the map/dome light housing before installing the LED's. I installed LED's in another car and the plastic cover only came off. For the Fiesta, the whole module comes out, and then you can take off the plastic cover. A quick Google search should aid you in this respect.
B00Q8FPC22|3|This mount was pretty cheap so I wasn't expecting cinematic quality results.  It was a little tricky to install in my small car, and the ball joint doesn't bend at quite the angles I would like, but it works.  Once you get it attached it holds very solid.  I forget it's there sometimes.  Not a bad product for the price.
B00QMWQROI|5|I needed new floor covers for my husbands car and I saw these online and decided to purchase them and was impressed with how quickly they arrived.<br />  I ordered the black set to match my husband's interior for his Pontiac vibe and they look pretty nice.  They are a little more thin than my last set that I bought at sam's club but at $12.95 for the normal price, I expected that to be the case.  I bought these at a discounted promotion rate (in return for my review which is no way swayed by a discount) so I could try them out and I needed a set anyways. They fit well and there is even a plastic area on the drivers side floor covers to protect where your feet will be resting.<br />  I noticed a few other reviews stating that they weren't worth it or weren't durable but I disagree. I like that they match the interior perfectly, they keep the floors underneath clean, and keep the mud from my shoes in one place.  The only con is that they have a tendency to move around a little over time and aren't as grippy but, in all honesty, at the price they are selling these, I am not looking for perfection.  My last set cost me 40 bucks and I am really happy that I can buy a new set, whenever I need to, and not pay an arm and a leg.  I would recommend these floor covers as they have done a pretty good job and I have had no issues. I even threw them in the washing machine and dryer as I got some mud on the one and it came out just fine. (I'm probably not supposed to do that but hey, I needed to clean 'em.)
B0007WXJDQ|5|Fast shipping and product works perfectly. Perfect replacement for my old 6.2 gallon Bowen water heater (Atwater bought Bowen I believe). Works perfectly. Didn't feel the need to upgrade to electric ignition. Very happy with my purchase, by finding YouTube videos I was able to entirely replace and move my water heater myself (I went to a hardware store to have copper flares made on the new copper pipe and had someone double check my fittings--which I used pipe compound on--as I personally tested them for leaks/air bubbles). Great product!
B004OK86XA|5|WorKs as advertised
B00GUI4NNG|5|Worked like a champ.
B001KPJDMU|2|This wiper arm didn't have the hinged cover or the grooves that lock the arm onto the motor spline. It wasn't the right part for my 99 Jeep Grand Cherokee as I hoped.
B000ETQMIQ|5|Works great. Sits in place. Large.
B00D97G2RQ|5|Product as described thank you
B0016KH254|5|Work perfect,
B00I8QRO8E|5|Awesome works perfectly great price!!!
B00N7N9KGM|5|nice nice
B000CAYSPQ|5|Replaced belts while replacing the water pump. Fit was fine.
B004GCWH7M|5|I bought replacement bulbs from autozone and paid $20  buy this entire headlight peice and pay $40ish?  Great deal.. plugged right in and fit just like the original on my 2006 Chevy Cobalt LT
B00LP5CACA|5|excellent produc and fit exactly in the engine, I recomend
B007Y53U8I|5|Just what I needed. Great fit.
B00RCKFG4G|3|First Impressions:<br />Received this part yesterday.  It was packaged well.  I've not installed it yet, but to me the wiring seemed a little light weight.  My biggest complaint is the build of it.  There were two large metal shavings hanging out from under the pre-installed o-ring.  Each shaving about half the circumference of the threaded portion.  Almost looked like a metal fingernail clipping.  Large enough it could have damaged the o-ring easily.  I will be inspecting the o-ring under a magnifying glass before install, but seemed okay at first glance.  Also, the threads seem poorly cut.  The initial edge of the threads seem a little far down and rough in nature.  Maybe the metal shavings are the first part of the thread?  I don't know.  I will attempt to install this all the same and see.  But if the internals are as shoddy as the threading and QC before packaging, I will be seeking a return.  I am hoping the threading and shavings is not an indicator of overall product quality and just an outlier.  I will update at a later time.<br /><br />BTW, its the ICP, not the IPR even though it is called the ICP Injection Pressure Sensor - they mixed up the words with the abbreviation.
B00UPKG6GM|5|Perfect fit
B001V8U12M|5|works good
B00CRR5L8U|5|Great part!
B001RBQF4G|4|Still looking for one of these where the ends are permanently rounded and therefore do not scratch my bike.  At first I thought this one had some good rubber tips, and they were good until they started falling off.  That issue aside, this is a good mesh restraint system
B00E9FK3UO|3|This sticker has vibrant color and sticks well, but isn't the easiest to put on. If you misplace one of the spindles, it's most likely going to throw off the whole sticker or you'll have to remove it, because it's too sticky to adjust.
B00NW62L88|5|Great Price for all the features, I needed a multimeter that could measure up to 10 amps and this one fit the bill at a good price. Comes with high quality probes.
B0002NUNLG|4|This works very well and cleans rims (in combination with a brush) quickly and effectively. Like other reviewers, I wish that you got more in a bottle since this does not last too long considering how much you need to apply to get an even coat to clean each wheel.
B000RXKR6M|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B009DJOBI6|5|Work were great and felt nice
B001EOWR3Y|3|It's O K but will not work for towing a trailer.
B007NZ60PO|5|Fenders fit well, great quality. Thumbs up!
B00PQWN5DQ|5|works well
B00DKEBCW8|2|Thin stamped piece.  Not what I expected.
B00B5FLSCI|5|I haven't had to use this item, Thank God, but it appears to be as described. Quality is nice. I was worried it would be flimsy but it seems to be very well put together! I'll be buying more to hand out.
B004ZF4DMC|4|Works great and easy to install . The people who pack the lights in the silver suitcase should take more pride and do a better job . Look like everything was just thrown into the  Silver box... And don't know why the high beams aren't 8k they are yellowish in color  Update ...one light burnt out  it lasted 4.5 weeks smh my other car light burned out in 3.5 weeks .... ....Customer service is great they do their best to resolve all problems that's why it went from a 2 to a 4 star
B00KY09VLA|5|Some modification required to install in the vehicle (hole needed to be changed from threaded to slightly enlarged for pass through bolt).  No problem with its function.  Completely satisfied.
B00LV3M1A2|5|Good so Far. Put on my chevy Silverado.
B000SL4AA2|5|It. Work. Liked I. Wanted. It tonight.
B000IYTT8M|5|Fit great. No issues
B0024GIVZ4|4|I love this
B000CGFZVG|5|Been running fine since installation
B0002LJQLQ|4|Connolly Leather Care Cleaner was used on a 2015 Jaguar XF Sport.<br />I would not think that the leather in the car would have gotten as dirty in 4 months as the remaing water showed so I have to say that it performed as intended and the results showed. It will be the cleaning solution for my sofas unlike the Connolly Hide Care which has gone in the garbage.<br />If interested, please, refer to the separate review of it.<br />I purchased Connolly's leather cleaner at the suggestion of another website and I would recommend it even though it contains ammonia but as long as it is used per the recommended ratio 1 part Connolly to 12 parts warm water, it should be fine but it is also the reason that I did not give it 5 stars due to the mixing.
B00ECJJX76|5|Great stuff as always and being a 3 in 1 is perfect for any project
B00UMQ5P8O|5|Fit perfectly and is the same exact part the dealer sells for a hundred and twenty five dollars.
B00U4LYKMY|4|very well made tool, did the job fast if you have a 6.0 ford you should have it in your tools box for fixing the problem !!!!!!
B00MD3EXEG|3|They don't line up where you would expect, you have to put the tape directly to the paint otherwise you can't open your door. They also don't work for blocking rain as well as other cars, due to the 86's window line and how far the plastic sticks out. They're not bad looking and they work decent in light rain. I don't regret the purchase but they could've been better.
B001IGBJNC|5|fits well and works like it should
B00KTIR1ZU|5|Got these for my daughter's car a 2008 Grand Prix. Took them to the dealer and got them both programmed and they work perfect.
B00G71KL1O|5|Exactly the image I wanted to project!
B0066RZ826|1|NOT FOR 2001 A4. The Cap that is on my existing tank won't fully close on this version tank and the back ends where you screw it down in place to the car are clips not screw holes. I can only attest for the 2001 Audi A4 as that is my car and what I got this tank for. Plus its definitely not OEM brand. Kinda looked like a 3rd party china ripoff.
B00ML02QNQ|5|Awesome, very satisfied..😀recommended...
B00EC0Y6OA|5|This really was easy to install and works great in my 2008 accord
B00TUNSOMO|5|This is a medium-gloss carnauba wax. It's not meant to be an all encompassing, ultra shine style wax, but more of a quick spray and go protectant.<br /><br />And as such, it works as advertised.<br /><br />I tried it on a boat, a jetski and my older SUV and it performed admirably on all. But as you can imagine, it worked best on the watercraft. It seems to take to fiberglass gelcoat best. This should come as no surprise, as this is what it's designed for, after all.<br /><br />If you're going to be using this as intended, you'll be quite happy with the results.
B00DSD7KBS|5|Great quality sticker. Bought an XS and the L. Package came undamaged and very fast. Love it!
B00W1OT0GS|5|Felt like there shouldve been washers becouse the nuts pull right through the plastic. Fixed it myself. Great product and service. Thanks
B004NKZOOK|5|Not expensive as OEM and handy to have just in case one of your coils goes out causing your car to run on one less cylinder. Pro-Tip....replace a bad ignition coil ASAP because driving while misfiring will damage the others and melt your catalytic converter. Be safe then sorry and always have at least 2 spare of these in your trunk.
B00E1SLKME|1|Sent me the wrong one,ask for 6 Lug and got 8.Now I have a beering that dond fit and out 52.00.
B00FZKHTOK|1|Garbage garbage garbage.  Fell apart in about 5 rides.  Glue is terrible for the throttle grip, rubber starts to push out of the grip holes, I know they're cheap but boy are they cheap. Stay away from these.
B000WL9HI8|5|Great product!  Attractive and is accurate. Update:  I bought 3 different types of thermometers a year ago and this is, by far, the best.  It's easy to install, easy to read and is far more accurate than the other two.  I highly recommend it.
B001C6OYYE|5|prefectfit
B00TPXOB08|5|Perfect!
B005U805X4|5|Good
B00150T13G|3|Did not last 15 days.
B00P1ZPAU4|5|I revamped an old cozy coupe for my nephew. I made it into a Tardis. This worked perfectly!
B00M8TB59Q|5|This fit our new Jeep's larger tire perfectly. My husband was pleased that I went ahead while he demurred.
B000FGJR1W|5|Great product!
B00J8W5Z9C|5|Great addition to the truck. It installed easily and looks great.  I have not had any issues with reception at all.  I really can't tell any difference in the reception.
B008YUE9BY|5|yes
B00C564LI4|5|This looks so killer on my cherry pearl SUV with a tattoo art frame surrounding it.
B000FNSTV4|5|This brush replaced an old worn out one that lasted many years.  Kept using the old one because it was so hard to find a decent replacement.  This brush is so good the old car wash brush is now out to pasture.  Holds a lot of soap and water and does a nice job removing dirt without harming the finish.  The price has gone up but if I needed it I'd buy this one again even at the new higher price.  Will buy another for backup if when it goes on sale.
B00FY87XT4|5|Better than OEM.
B00I5058AY|4|fits perfect on 2014 ram 1500  easy install
B009FQZD6Q|4|many comments on its looks
B00B2HV68A|4|Just what we needed for our light fixture.
B000CRBRZI|5|price was great , fit perfect ,great product
B00230H1SO|1|Would much rather have this tool with a built-in handle versus using a rachet attachment. PITA using a ratchet attachment..
B000B6CVZU|5|the only difference mine had a truck stamped on it this had a car , oh well works great though
B004VTZVUK|5|Perfect fit on 2010 tundra!
B00GUA5RAM|5|Just like new, Easy to install as well
B00GSAUHB8|3|Good shade but it is necessary to have a mechanical engineer to refold the shade.  It refolds about 60% of the time.
B00LU3WSTM|5|Great product, works as advertised , I can get a leg over it now and touch the ground flat footed. Preload on rear spring needs to be tightened up to decrease the sag after install which was a 30 minute job!
B007WQQHA2|5|This tool has been a timesaver for doing electrical connector modifications on Mercedes Benz...I strongly recommend one for every Mercedes Benz technician
B002GUELBQ|5|Great price. Fast Shipping. The right oil.
B00192KZQ2|3|great item.<br />it fades and gets cloudy from sunlight if left outside.<br />item gets to a point that one can hardly see through the item.
B00MJLCV5U|4|Fit like OEM and came with new circuit boards for the tail light bulbs, no more blown bulb problems and the lenses look good too.
B00A9OCPPK|5|Took a little time to install, but it fits the 2014 Titan just fine. Looks absolutely awesome!
B000C6KMAK|5|WORKS FINE
B00U12BVNW|4|Goods arrived in good condition and as expected.
B006B21JMO|5|Excellent
B00EM7S414|1|This roller worked for about 3 months and then the nylon rollers broke, just like the 6 year old factory ones had. I ended up having to buy a genuine honda part and swap it out again.
B000FIY08U|5|worked very well
B000143LHY|5|Great stuff!
B0091U4T9I|4|Fits the way you'd expect an OEM part to fit.  I like the clever design that let's you pull of the crossbars effectively without any tools once you get the mounts slid into the racks.  Pretty minimal gas mileage drop with them in place, and they can nicely be pushed all the way towards the rear of the car, which I assume has some aerodynamic benefits - but I don't have a wind tunnel handy to verify this.  Fits my Yakima Skybox Pro 12 nicely and securely.  Thanks to the design of the CX-5 sunroof, there's no interference with operating the sunroof and having a cargo box installed.
B007V2CQ9S|5|It works great. Really keeps the car cooler in the summer by at least 5 to 10 degrees a every degree counts when you live in the desert
B002R4U72I|5|Haven't used yet but will soon and the product looks great!!!!
B00K35UZAW|4|Good price, quick shipping, worked as advertised & hoping its last.
B005LGURG0|5|Fit perfectly
B00JFALCVW|5|Fit perfectly. One became loose but was easily reapplied. No problems!
B00A14QNP6|5|Switch as described and worked fine. Part would get here faster in the mail.
B00FAV94I8|1|Having owned many SUV's and always purchased the bumper protectors, I was disappointed when this one arrived.  My son has a new Mini Countryman and he will be using it for hiking, biking, snowboarding etc. so I felt this would provide that added protection from all the loading/unloading of his gear.  WRONG!  This is so small it barely covers any of the bumper lip.  Way too short and way too skinny to be of any help.  Will be returning and I have to pay the freight back.  Poor design, save your money!!
B00JE48Y0G|5|Fit real good.
B00NVVHQL6|5|Love it on my 2011 lacrosse
B00DBH8W4K|5|This should've been standard equipment on any auto-equipped JK. I use it constantly. The install took me all of 5 minutes. It makes the long drives much more comfortable.
B00LA16XWM|5|Works great on my Honda Shadow VT750 ACE.
B005ETKI54|5|pump worked great so far truck was sitting for a while new pump was quick to respond and strong pushed fuel through pressure valve really fast and strong .
B00IKKS4W8|5|Jacks are fast and easy for setting up my camper. I did not bolt then on yet. Going to weld them on frame before next trip.
B00HJ6O4A0|2|I got the box was damage and all wet not good.
B00RW7WG8I|5|Easy install, perfect fit, and wipe well, as they should. So much better than the goodyear ones they replaced and every bit as good as the much more expensive ones at the auto parts stores. At this price I may change them out every 6 months like I should. My wife wanted to learn how to install. She learned quickly. The hardest part was getting the old ones off.
B000C59SM4|5|Installed on a 2004 Venture ,only took about an hour.They work great.
B002XMSIVQ|5|Removing the old bearing was  quick process.. very well made tool
B00C82YQIA|4|I live my life a quarter mile at a time so I need this hat. It also covers my bald spot now if it could only help me to lose weight I'd be able to give it a five star review. If you have W.R.X. you'll be able to burn this hat when your futile attempts to change the spark plugs get you down ( If you own a WRX you know what I mean).
B0040D0PJ4|5|Hold tight, ordered another box.
B00DD98SAY|5|quick and easy install. just wish these things where not so expensive :(. and honestly i don't know why people would buy the 30$+ removal tool. waist of money!. i just used fingers and it popped right our easily. installation took about 15 minutes. so far so good with no leaks.
B00IS91B2G|5|Looks great, comes with all new hardware. The outside is plastic covered in Chrome, but no worse than the factory grille.. Hopefully lasts longer. The inside is metallic and feels/looks high quality. Exact fit and finish. Good price with fast shipping  Love the new look!
B000CPJMZW|5|What's to say; IT IS WHITE GREASE!  Fixed several problems I need for a thicker staying grease. After I fixed the problems I bought it for, I found my tube of lithium white grease.  Seems someone, the other half, wanted to fix a squeaky door, which is one of the reasons I ordered this. She couldn't get it to stop squeaking, told me, I couldn't find the tube I've had since 1972, ordered this and was happy with it. Oh, the other half asked me why I didn't use the stuff in the tube that she put in the junk drawer.
B000XBFBZ0|5|Nice Quality, good fit.
B00LCFHMNU|1|No
B00UFERZKO|5|Worked as described.  Fans could be a little quieter but they are not too loud.
B000C5I2YO|5|I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase
B004TDNUOC|5|This &#34;OE&#34; brake line matched up to my 2003 Chevy Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck.<br />My only dislike about the brake line is the included copper washers. Would have preferred steel.
B00D3298A0|3|does the job,
B0035YGLZG|5|Excellent item. Very convenient to use. Like the circuit splitting ability.
B00GQ48FCY|5|Thanks
B004ETCSL2|5|Excellent light, was able to put in an outside corner of my house that does not have an electrical outlet.  Light is bright, and the motion detector works well.  Buying a few more since this one worked out well.
B000O5DUP8|5|A great addition for my cargo carrier. And easy to install
B00FFEWONC|4|I was constantly wearing out the outside of my lower legs from high speed turn washouts.  I was looking for minimal crash protection, just something to save my skin.  This works quite well for that.  They are a little tight for me, but I am very satisfied with what I got for the price.
B0034ZUZM6|5|great  items for the price
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Love these lights! !<br />Super bright. Easily mounted.<br />I wired into factory wiring on my ATV.<br />I used these to replace the factory lights.
B009SDZUBE|5|I washed it used it and I think it is great. I'm drinking my favorite coffee right now. Couldn't be happier. Thanks Walter Morrison
B00WA1U7MS|5|I love this safety tool. I got one for my wife as well. It's great because there are many uses for this one tool. The flashlight is very bright and comes in handy when checking the tire pressure.
B007TY4Y2U|5|Awesome purchase. It fit perfectly. It took about 10-15mins, T20 star head, 10mm socket, and watching some youtube videos, and I was good to go. To add, this was to replace the driver side mirror on my 2005 Ford Focus.<br />As a warning, be careful with the 10 mm screw. You access it through a hole in the frame of the door. So be careful, lest it drop into the frame. I can see it happening to someone, and as Mr. T would say, I would pity the fool.
B002ZRQ50A|5|good price have not needed to use yet
B0009IQZH0|5|My primary use for these was to test them against the &#34;cooling towels&#34; that are so popular today. I have a couple of those, made of PVA and they're very effective though they're annoyingly stiff when dry so they're hard to put back in their containers after use. The top consumer review mag tested the PVA against regular towels and found they work similarly. My experience was about the same though the Meguiar cloths need to be turned quite a bit more frequently to maintain the cooling, I imagine that's the difference in materials. As a multi-purpose cloth that I can also use as a cooling cloth in a pinch these work great, the edges are soft and they should hold up nicely although they are a bit small when draping around the neck for cooling while doing yard work. I also tested a cloth towel and it didn't work nearly as well as the Meguiar. Overall, the 02 Cool and Frogg Toggs towels I have get an A grade, Meguiar's gets a B to B+ and a dish towel comes in at a C or lower.
B00WJHK1XS|4|Works great but fuel lines are 1/4&#34; not the stock 5/15&#34;, I just replaced the 2 short pieces of hose vent line works just fine
B00IO3D750|5|Received order sooner than expected. Installed on vehicle and they work perfectly.
B002ZS4QCS|3|These are agood idea to keep shopping bags from slidding off my leather seats. The only problem is that you have to use both hands to remove bags because they catch on the end of the hook😕
B002P37DKK|5|This is an awesome product.  Somebody really thought this through when it was designed.  Only way to pull a 5th wheel.  Makes it very easy to switch between pickup, as most of our pickups already have.
B0009PSA4O|5|Worth the money!
B0087HWXEE|5|This is a great floor liner that keeps your car's carpet clean and spotless, while at the same time taking whatever dirty, sandy shoes you can throw at it.  Definitely worth the expense.
B00GGGWRO4|5|Arrived on time. Perfect size. Easy application. Must buy!
B00DBEN5BS|5|Thank you
B00KC4XSEE|5|Exactly what it says and fits like a glove. Also Extremely fast shipping.
B00LEBLI82|5|Love the light it gives off, white and bright!
B00GWFPPU2|5|Great coverage and I like that they cover the 'dead' pedal on the driver's side.  Competition doesn't...
B007S13FP6|5|It is exactly what it says it is. Had it installed within an hour of recieving it.
B00D42AFS8|5|so handy on our wintery roads
B000EQ0262|5|Centric Parts has always been my number one choice of quality automotive replacement items. My OEM Honda front left caliper was getting stuck and warped my rotor. I decided that it would be more viable to buy a rebuilt caliper than do it myself.  This listing is only for the Front Right (142.40045) so make sure to buy the Front Left (142.40046) [[ASIN:B000EQ022G Centric Parts 142.40046 Posi Quiet Loaded Friction Caliper]] It is always recommended to replace both calipers at the same time to make sure they apply at the same time for even brake wear.  This caliper is basically a full rebuild with all new gaskets, caliper pins and boots. There is also a new bleeder valve attached with a cover. You will have to use your old brake caliper bolts to connect it onto the rotor, though.  My pins were not greased so make sure to use 3M Clear Silicone Paste because other greases (brake pad grease) will swell up the rubber boots and not allow the pins to guide freely, causing uneven wear on your rotor and pads. The bore of the caliper and its gaskets are brand new and will expand evenly.  The only downside of these calipers is that they were painted a slight gold metallic that was already flaking off. Although it was a bad paint job, it looked better than rusted calipers which I'm sure most people have. I sandblasted my calipers and powder coated them black so it didn't matter for me in the end.
B00DCEQX6Q|5|I got this for my husband its his second pair.  My husband loves the fit and feel of Churchill gloves its the only gloves  he will use when riding.
B00GXPI15W|5|excelent
B006Z6FDZ0|5|Did the job perfectly! I had a plug-in cooler for my car, that had screws at the bottom of 6&#34; shafts and couldn't find a screw driver that was skinny enough to get to the bottom of those tapered holes. This one worked great, though!
B000ETQMIQ|3|Other reviews have done a good job pointing out the best and worst features. Just be sure to check the dimensions. I was expecting something larger. The description is &#34;large&#34; after all. It is however the size of an insulated lunchbox. A bottle six pack would fill it completely, just for size reference. I bought it because my wife collects a disturbing amount of litter in her car from eating breakfast and lunch on the go. It won't work for her, but it's perfect for me. I like that it's waterproof and fastens by velcro so you can open/close it with one hand. Magnets would have probably been better though.
B00BMRZN66|5|The TERAPUMP TRHD05 is the best pump I have ever used. I've had at least three other pumps I used with kerosene and gas over the past seven years. The handle on this pump makes it much easier to use as far as keeping control of the fluid being used. It also pumps the fluids it was designed for very well.
B001DCH3T0|5|Just what I needed, works great.
B00563MFH2|5|Work great, instructions and programming were simple and well explained.
B00P1NU7KO|5|Great overall replacement/upgrade item for a motorcycle.  Finish was as expected and there is a TON of room in the bucket for wiring on older bikes.  Having the capability to interchange bulbs was reason for purchase...  No disappointed.
B0088PZVOO|4|Fits my 2016 RDX.  Is more of a hard plastic than rubber material.  The edges are modeled up maybe an inch to tow inches.  &#34;RDX&#34; modeled into it.  Arrived flat in a huge box - you can imagine how large that box was.
B005N53AM2|4|Thought people were exaggerating the smell...not so much. Its been months and it still is SO strong! I don't dare take it off to throw it in the wash cause it was a pain getting it on the wheel to begin with. Overall the material works, bright colors and is comfy. Just wish they could fix the smell
B00F3J2FW4|5|Great product for the price.
B00EI6CKVE|4|Got tired of seeing stick figure families on base so I got this. Got some laughs out of a few bystanders. Only complaint: slightly larger than I anticipated. Still awesome though!
B000PI27E4|1|Does not fit. Terrible
B00UJ9BPC4|1|Wont fit my nissan altima
B0087NB088|4|Great piece of equipment, I would say one of the best on the market. I would give 5 stars of it canceled out sound a little better during a phone call so that the other person can hear a little better,  but I imagine it is nearly impossible for that to happen when you're riding on the highway. Great equipment.
B00NBN1C78|5|This is a great idea that many trailer owners (myself included) have been waiting for. In the past, when I have used one of my trailers I have had to load all of the jack items into my truck so that I have them in case the trailer got a flat. Now with this device I can mount all of that onto the trailer and no longer do I have to worry about remembering to pack the jack and lug nut wrench.<br /><br />I do worry, however, that the case being made out of steel is going to be an issue in the future. Any trailer owner will tell you that any part of the metal you scratch on a trailer during normal use will start to rust over time. Also corners/seams of the metal are prone to rust over time. I worry that this case will start to rust either in part or in whole in the future. Unfortunately our trailers are out in the elements year round so this is a possibility. Anyway, I will come back and revise the review if this starts to happen. In the meantime, this is a great product and we love it.
B0085I1DL4|1|Pushes the rider to far forward and jabs in the middle of the back
B000GU0B80|5|Works just like it is suppose too.
B000BVN960|1|didn't fit my Toyota Camry 2015.
B000RSTXG2|5|very good article work fine on my boat and very good quality I highly recommend
B00SKTEA2M|5|Great replacement for the more expensive Vortex slider. Fits perfectly, looks identical to the Vortex one. Doesn't come with hardware.
B005GM9FTO|5|Awesome! Perfect fit!
B0032YWFNG|1|Close to being one of the worst products I have ever purchased.  The fit was horrendous, the clips wouldn't hold so it couldn't be tightened properly.  The hood wouldn't close properly and it was just an overall inferior product.  I would not recommend this item to anyone.  Returned it the same day.
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Before and after shots! Love the result!
B00E62MUYM|5|These were exactly what I expected. Cheap minimal mirrors that I could bolt onto my handguards. I put them on my motorcycle and it is nice to have low profile mirrors instead of the stock ones. They don't give quite enough view behind me though because I modified Acerbis handguards to make them fit instead of attaching them to the matching branded handguards that they fit correctly.
B00POWSOQ6|5|Lifesaver.
B000NWA8M0|5|Everything worked like it should.
B00IPZ8SOC|5|Came very quick, brand new, no scratches and fit my helmet (RF1100) great.
B001EYHK5E|5|Fast shipment and a very very heavy duty product. I was worried about ordering a product like this without seeing it, but this measures up to what I wanted. I have a 8,000 lb boat and I have not been worried this will hold up.<br />Great Product
B000BWE3PK|4|Good Price.
B0013HP98C|5|So far, so good.  Piece is relatively flimsy, but it is serving its purpose.  I've included a picture of it mounted to my car after a bit of sandblasting and spray painting.
B003IS3HV0|5|Shawn,<br />I purchased the 1/2 gl bottle of Leather Honey for a sole reason  - to<br />treat two leather sofas my wife and I bought 12 years ago. We paid $3,100<br />for each sofa. I am 62 and plan to live another 30 plus years. The sofas<br />will last that long; actually much longer. Why? I just polished them with<br />three 2.8 oz cans of Kiwi brown shoe polish; each sofa. Turned them back to<br />'looking' new. Then I treated them with your Leather Honey to return the<br />oil to the leather to make it supple. Also, to treat the seams to keep the<br />leather soft. Dry leather contracts causing stitching to fail. Sorry for<br />the long review. You see, the Leather Honey is cheap insurance in my mind.<br />Plus the supple, rejuvenated leather provides for a  satisfying experience.<br />Your fine product is well worth the price.<br />Semper Fi,<br />Dean Meyeraan<br /><br />(learned a few things about leather while spending twenty in the Corps)
B000CIQA90|5|item as expected
B008C7CIBC|1|Chain is the weak link. It breaks and it's lost. The  ring is below average strength and should be much stronger. Shipping time is long. Do not recommend. Pay a little more for something sturdier built.
B0007IJR1I|2|I bought it to clean off road film but no luck with that. Otherwise it works well.
B004AIHKT2|5|This is a perfect fit for fixing the &#34;pink thingy&#34; problem that has just happened to me.<br /><br />Your experiences will vary, but I will state mine below in-case it helps you. My vehicle is a 2005 Dodge Magnum.<br /><br />First, if you are reading this you've obviously have been doing research on replacing this and I am going to assume that it is happening to you right now.<br /><br />If you are stuck, there is a really simple way of getting your car out of park and there is more than one video on Youtube showing you how. It simply requires you to remove the bezel surrounding the gear shift console. Using a long item, like a screw driver, you can look into the upper middle and see a tension wire. If you gently push out the wire, you will be able to get your car out of park. I actually used this method for about 2 weeks until I had time to try and do the replacement.<br /><br />Second, some cars have actually already been recalled for this issue. The only problem is that the recall is by VIN# and not all cars qualify. Check to see if it falls under the Chrysler recall K39<br /><br />Third, There are a good few videos showing you how to do the actual replacement. I would rate the skill level as being moderate and much easier if you have access to the right tools.<br /><br />Now, here is the problem I ran across and I hope it doesn't happen to you. I was able to get the gear console out, but unable to remove the shift knob. This turned out to be a bigger issue than I was expecting because for whatever reason the previous owner had used a bondo or welding product to secure it.<br /><br />Thinking that my local shop could help me, I brought it down to a garage and after many attempts, they were forced to break it off. After it was broken off, the replacement was rather easy, the product is a perfect fit and putting it back together was as simple taking it apart (minus the knob). Finding an OEM knob on the other hand is not so easy and expensive.<br /><br />All in all, this part is a great and will save you a lot of money if you chose to do it yourself.in all, this part is a great and will save you a lot of money if you chose to do it yourself.
B0043SCBD4|5|Easy install, forget removing the tailgate and just pop the plastic loop over the hinge. Whole process took about 5 minutes.
B007P8APUA|5|This is a must have for every vehicle in your house! It's a multiple use safety escape tool. Two triple A batteries for the flashlight and tire gauge. The glass cutter recesses with a simple push button and the razor blade is not in the way of the sturdy handle. We have one in each vehicle. A definite must have for all of your vehicles.
B00563MFH2|5|FOB sent in a timely manner. Remote works as promised and is easy to program. Recommend this product.
B00X7DURKU|4|Good product further can regulate the speed of the flashing ....
B007KCX5PS|5|totally satisfied, excellent seller.
B00D1O9KFS|4|Had them in for about a month so far. No complaints. My 528i is riding smooth again.
B00603DSI2|1|You must cut this item to fit a two door.  Defeats the purpose because the Dust dirt and water get in the cut outs to the rug and body.
B008SBWGP0|5|attaches simply to the face of the winch mount plate and dresses up the mount.
B00387LB14|2|These are supposed to be for street use.  But on my 2005 PT Cruiser GT Stage 1 automatic, these inserts create a LOT of vibration at idle.  And the vibration increases more with the AC on.  I've tried making the arms on the inserts smaller to help loosen up the strut mounts a bit.  But at least some of the vibration remains.  If you plan to race, these inserts seem to do a good job of stabilizing the engine.  But if vibration bothers you, sticking with the stock unmodified strut mounts might be the better solution.
B0000AZ7EY|5|nice
B00CQD4CM6|5|Great product and I got it quick. Thank you
B00029WSX6|5|Although the first one came loose it integrated perfectly into my 2002 Camaro. Now I will never have to wonder what the temperature is again and will always know what direction I am headed!
B00RTLUPVC|1|Terrible product with terrible design. If you want to use this with your car forget about it, The neck is flimsy and will not stay up. Obviously you need ot use 2 hands when dealing with 5 gallon can - would have returned this if I had not used it already. Piece of junk...do not waste your money.
B001HT1NG8|5|Great seat. Love the backrest!
B00171VT9W|5|worked great bolted right on
B00DNX94E4|5|Great quality,  Supper fast shipping
B00MJ7V4Q6|3|It faded rather quick.  Started fading after a week.  I did like how it looked though.  Once it faded it looked more like suede.  When it comes in, it looks like velvet.
B00C6MYCVS|1|No idea what this is but definitely not a mitsubishi outlander inner cv boot. Way too small.
B00C0YKJ6E|5|Better than expected. Going to buy another for coolant use.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|I am happy!
B00TPZP6HS|4|Great quality vinyl decal, a bit difficult to apply without ripping the sticker apart
B00AZL7QLK|5|works great!
B004KDEWTS|5|Worked well, used to replace several screens, on several generations of Iphone. tools become warn over time, but is to be expected when used repeatedly.
B002BELP3Y|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B001J4VLNG|2|First one lasted 23 months and failed at 8700 miles, left us stranded in our class c camper in the middle of the road 600 miles from home.<br />I'll let you know how the second one does, worked great while it worked.
B0007N5758|5|Great little brush. Does the job very effectively.
B00NOIKOM4|5|Very pleased with product. Easy to apply and so far is holding up well.
B007AOQW24|5|I had ordered the WeatherBeater before and liked them.

B00VA5N26S|5|I have not driven my 2007 Honda Fit for like 3 months after open heart surgery. The battery is DEAD to say the least. The original battery (8 years old) needed replacement prior to my not being able to drive. Being skeptical after reading negative reviews and watching videos where people held the unit and read the instructions and only one actually started his dead tractor, I was not convinced that it would do the trick. Boy was I wrong. I read the directions and charged it for 6 hours as indicated. I took the unit out to the car and hooked the cables to the battery (Red + Positive) and (Black - Negative) ((Very important not to mix polarities)). As soon as I plugged the Jumpstart Socket into the 12V port the horn started to honk indicating just how dead the battery was. Clicking the lock / unlock on the car key to clear the alarm and then entered the key into the ignition and my 92 horse power 4 cylinder engine started with out hesitation.  We (my unbiased neighbor and myself) ran the engine for an hour and a half during a trip to a couple of stores. The battery will not hold a charge. We did a few more errands and felt confident as we Jump Started again two more times before we parked it for the day in less than three hours.  Now I will be getting a second unit for the wife's car, my neighbor will be getting one, and this device deserves more than 5 stars.
B000SESVS6|5|Very nice item. Helps me show my pride for my son and the Army. Easy to install. Will order from seller again.  Thanks.
B008JPGEQC|1|Failed after 3 weeks. Got a replacement and failed again in less than a month. Bought one from autozone and it's been going for 6 months no issues.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|I use this kit every time I was my 2015 Camaro. Leaves it spotless every single time. Highly recommend to keep your car pampered and you can do so with this kit!
B001NZD2XI|5|I bought two ball joints and very satisfied with both. They fit perfect. 99 maxima.
B00N396SHE|5|The directions were a little out of date, but a call to tech support quickly resolved that problem. I was able to install a performance tune, and modify my tire size, fuel type, and transmission as well. Haven't noticed too much in the way of power, but I think my fuel economy has gone up a little bit.
B00EKEGRVS|1|Horrible
B001THP2I8|5|Fantastic product so easy to use with great results, couldn't believe the showroom shine which just lasts and lasts......
B00M8UDCBE|3|Just got this helmet in the mail. Sadly it's too big. I measured and ordered a small. I'm a woman and it definitely has to much move room for me. bummer because it looks great and the features are nice.
B00JDPZY04|1|Did not fit the bike it say its for.
B009KT2GQI|5|Great product. Love the sound and fits perfectly
B00YTZ9EEK|5|Good product
B008A7AYJM|4|This replaced the stick shift knob in my Dad's 2009 Mini Cooper S. It fits perfectly, and didn't need any of the adapters to get a great nice fit. My Dad said he loves the look of it, and it works perfectly. It does fit nicely, and was an easy change over for him. The reason I would rate it as a 4 instead of a 5 is because of 2 reasons. 1. I wish the helmet didn't have the designs all over it or the bottom, but I'm sure it's a copyright reason as I haven't been able to find one that doesn't have those. 2. It does really make the resting of my hand on the stick shift higher about 2-3 inches than it was before. Minor discomfort, but overall a great sturdy product I expect to last for quite some time. Great for your Star Wars fan in the family for sure!
B00XTFOLG2|5|Fits looks great
B00IXW0H3W|5|Just what I needed.
B00U1YP4MY|5|these seat covers are great, pain to but on but great also no seat belt holes in rear cover FYI
B001AMH80C|5|perfect fit and very easy to install
B003TQ0D04|5|nice quality
B002MCVGB6|5|Great stuff.
B010PC4ZZ8|1|I doesn't fit on my Cadillac cts v8 2013  it's bigger than the normal one I don't know what I spouse to do with it now
B00N3XVNXE|2|It sealed most of it but it still has a small leak. When my truck is off water goes out through the leak and after a couple of minutes it runs out of water. Overall it is a ok job
B000CNHX0A|5|As exported
B001NZQID4|5|It works.
B006K8VIAM|5|very good for car
B00NCK0GJA|5|fits and works like the original in my 2006 Aveo.
B0054FJEDK|5|No problem when used with my generic scan tool.
B00750OFKO|5|Great and comfortable grips!
B009FREAGO|4|Does the job but check the dimensions.  Small than I thought.
B002N5JB5A|2|Poor paint, not square drive only, but combo Square and Phillips
B004UM6DLE|4|Took off one star because this stuff smells like death. Otherwise, it's great for removing those random flecks of iron that inexplicably get stuck to your car's side panels and bumper, then rust over the winter. If for some reason this doesn't take care of the job completely, you can usually hit it with detailing clay to knock out the rest.
B00EDWF1BE|5|Love this product cleaned up the look of factory tiedowns,easy to put on and adjust.....definitely would recommend.
B0009IQXCM|5|This wax is high quality and gives a great coat that lasts a few weeks (depending on weather).
B00BMU9IA0|1|The piston broke after putting in fourwheeler
B005794F28|5|Nice fairing looks awesome on my road king like the glove box for storage good hogtune speakers and radio. .
B000B6CVZU|5|Perfect
B009DK3E6A|5|Good price and fast shipping. Item was easy to install on my 1995 geo tracker. Fixed my 4 wheel drive and looks good!
B009DJYTQU|5|Perfect match
B00CT01H3I|4|As spected
B00NGHLY4U|5|I'd say these didn't take 5 minutes to replace the old ones with, it was more like 3 minutes. Seriously, how easy was that? All you need is a flat head screwdriver (medium sized) and someone or something to hold the lift gate while you change it (you can actually do it yourself though). Pop off the clamp that's on the end of the current liftgate strut, there's one at each end. Find the flat area on the opposite side of the opening and slide the screwdriver under the clamp there, twist the screwdriver to release the clamp, once it's loose then pull the strut away from the ball joint and ta da, it's off. Once you get both removed then get the replacement strut and line up the hole and pop it in place (don't remove the clamp to install). Do the other end the same way and that's it. It really took about 3 minutes to do and my wife was super happy she doesn't have to hold the gate open when she uses it now. This is an easy 5 star.
B000WKFDJQ|5|top quality & will be back for more.EBC must be the best for the $$$.thanks.
B00C0W8YF4|4|Great lift kit but I suggest a drop bell crank and a slip yoke eliminator because you'll need it.
B005N53AM2|3|Not as expected
B003IDE4U8|2|Hubby used for a trip to CO in the LX but they honestly did not fit. I am referring to the cargo as well as mats for front and back seat manufactured by same co. They stink like cheap Chinese plastic and did not really fit. Went directly to the trash  after the trip. Hoping to buy from weathertech like the ones we have in the GX. Those are amazing!!!
B00N0IHMXM|5|Works as it should? I need to start and finish the jack with my hand  held socket as this one spins when jack is on ground or full up.
B000HI6NOC|4|works well
B000CMDA1C|5|Well known for class in the field, again they have a winner. I have used them for years and again they are the class of the field
B00XWQMJNK|3|This is a lower quality replacement for the oem keyless entry that came with the car. It is priced right, ie - you get what you pay for so I'm not complaining however my unit has developed a problem with the unlock button. The button worked fine at first but in the last week it requires more and more force to activate the micro switch. I will return this but still may get another one only because the price is one third of factory and my 04 sienna is on its way out soon!
B0015D4ZNY|4|The large box is kind of difficult to attach and the handlebar mount can slide A bit however this is much better than the hardwired previous version and I was able to tap into the ignition switch
B006XG6L08|5|Replaced sealed beams on '99 roadstar. Looks sweet, more light! Installed matching headlight!
B000CIY0U6|3|Quality product that unfortunately did not work with my 2015 Silverado 1500. When placed on the tailgate the lift assist no longer worked.
B0024GYBZ8|3|Nice helmet but not used to a helmet not protecting neck....sits on top of head...no neck protection.
B00CAKILAO|5|Is a great trunk mat....heavy duty and well made....would buy again.....highly recommend it!
B00D329DI2|4|They were a bit small but they do the job
B00BNXHN58|1|Too tight...so tires are wear out quickly. And tires are rotated like going in raining when to brake.
B00BTSJ9ZE|5|Works lie a champ for only a fraction of the cost
B0041Q5BG2|1|There is no space to insert an Allen key for tightening the riser, I have not installed it on my bike. I asked the technician but he was also not able to install it. I threw it away
B00IMUC9YA|5|I bought this along with the rhinestone shift knob.  They complement each other and look great!  Quality on both products is very good and we'll put together.  I also bought the license plate frame and the rhinestone tire caps.  Gotta love the bling to dress things up!!!<br />Andrea South Beloit IL
B003UM7B98|5|Very nice jack<br />- pumps and raises easily<br />- lighter than expected<br />- quality better than expected<br />- love the nice, smooth, let down of the jack<br />- moves easily<br /><br />Compared to the Torin Big Red jack... (it was new) failed 3 ton jack I just returned to the store.....this jack is miles and miles ahead of it!!!
B007TYFO42|5|Fit perfectly and looks great. After I changed the headlights, the new headlights made the old park lights look worse than I had realized. For the low price, I changed them as well. They fit fine once getting the old ones out. It seems the old ones mounting hardware has stuck over time. Once out, the new ones went it easily. They did not come with new bulbs, so while I was at it, I went to the store and got new bulbs. Made the truck look almost like new.
B00AO6LRFW|5|Did a very good job.  Vendor mailed it quickly and packaged well.  Refinishing a salvaged leather recliner took about half the bottle.  Light tan to black.
B000CRDMS8|5|Got it ahead of schedule and fit perfectly
B004DC7RTI|4|Nice heavy duty quality, but they are not clear, sort of lavender...
B00X01F8BW|3|Quick delivery, good quality and definitely water proof as proven by a recent downpour.  I’ve given this cover just an OK rating because it does not properly fit around the right and left front edges of my 2015 GMC Sierra Double Cab SLT short bed. Considering ths cover is advertised as a cover for this model truck, it simply does not fit correctly. See photos attached.
B00757KJTI|5|Works great
B00IABG9YC|5|Perfect fit
B005PWUVI4|5|Works well for my purposes.
B00SSC80Y0|5|easy to install great look
B00I89MLZM|5|Very nice ....
B000765MHI|5|I had purchased this to use in my truck. I do security work outdoors, my truck is my office.this was a means to combat the humid Texas nights and save the ac freon. It arrived 2days earlier than expected, unbroken good shape. I read several reviews on this fan and others before deciding on this. It has been said this fan is loud, which it is.....but only if you run it full open,it does have a speed control built into it. Does sound like a hair dryer at full blast. Little playing with the speed adjustment you can find a comfortable setting that wont burn your ears off. It has several adjustment points on it, you can virtually point it any way you need. Its been stated it doesnt draw that much power from your battery, but enclosed instructions say to run with your vehicle on, .....the whole point was use in place of the AC, while saving gas, it just a matter of  testing,finding out if it will drain the battery, otherwise pleased with purchace.
B0009IQZFM|5|This is a great drying towel, I keep 3 on hand for each wash & dry then wash them in between, worth the money.
B00GJKXW8M|4|Worth the try. Hooked up 2 on a 2000 ranger great for pulling out of the driveway at night
B00RDFG1G2|5|very good
B0076SO3VG|5|This sticker looks sick and I've power washed my car many times, still on. Gives simple instructions to put on.
B00A8MZ910|5|I haven't used them yet as they just arrived, but quality looks very good.
B005JU5XE4|5|Super easy to install and they work great!
B001PYN6QK|5|Just like deacribes.. good quality... will recommend to anybody
B00JXTSVB4|4|Handy to have an extra!!!
B000RFUETA|5|Good jack, perfect for low profile vehicles.
B000JFJLP6|5|One of the best investments ever I think everyone should own one.
B009PNEIHY|3|Basically a nice cover but the backs are thin stretchy nylon which snag too easily so I have snags and one has a hole from the snag. The straps that go under the seat don't tighten on the clip very well so have to tie a knot. Not sure if I'd buy again
B0054YCW62|4|Works great
B00029WRKA|5|No problemswith the mirror.  Goes right over our existing one so you can use your existing mirror and the extension.
B00V337VNM|5|Bought these for my Nissan Versa with 15 inch tires. Installed easily and look great.
B001CEG90I|3|works, but the instructions are a little confusing. They have an arrow and say &#34;up next to it&#34;.<br />So, does the arrow represent the up direction, or the air flow direction? It doesn't say it anywhere
B00009PGNR|1|Disappointed<br />I bought this to keep drinks cool in our upstairs TV room.  While it advertises that it will keep items 40 degrees colder than ambient, it is in a room with air conditioning set at 74 degrees.  I purchased a thermometer to check the temperature and it stabilizes at 52 degree (not 74-40=34 degrees as advertised).  If I was keeping food in it that temperature would not be not acceptable.  Fortunately, I am only keeping drinks and not food in the cooler - and it is more convenient than schlepping ice packs in a cooler.<br /><br />The fan is a bit noisy  (but can't be heard over the window air conditioner), and runs all the time.  I was happy enough until I found out the temperature was not in spec<br />12/11 UPDATE: Solved the temperature too high problem with frequent defrosting. BUT this week it stopped cooling altogether &#62;:(  .  I emailed customer support at Koolatron, but have heard absolutely nothing back.<br />Started at dissapointed..... went to okay, now at extremely dissatisfied customer.
B00U062DA4|5|Plug and play. Works great.
B008Y9K0OU|1|If you looking for quick fix use it but the silkscreen is off and blurred.
B00CFHSFVM|5|Seats fit well. I had no way to remove the head rests. So I cut in between them and then used needle and thread to stitch it back together. Looks Great
B0094JIIMK|5|it works
B000C2EAIO|5|Excellent product considering that the exact same sale somewhere else for twice or three times the price.<br />If you need to buy it don't hesitate
B009LN4SN2|5|Excellent Deal.
B006960HKW|5|Beautiful artwork on a very heavy sticker, hoping the strong sunshine won't fade it.
B00Q16FWJQ|5|big thank you to sticker tiger, there was a small shipping problem and they made sure to fix it right away no hassle.
B002BHWZFI|2|Cat crap is good to around 75percent humidity. After that it becomes 100 percent useless both my goggles face shield and riding glasses almost instantly fogged up after 75 percent humidity while on my motor cycle traveling at 55 mph during the day here in North Carolina. this is clearly a product that should be sold only to people that live in a zero humidity climate (some place like the moon maybe.)
B000FFCZGM|5|Bought this to replace one I had on my F-150 for the past 9 years.  It held up very well.  The new one went on without a hitch and looks great.
B00LBW5QOG|5|It was exactly what I needed at a steal compared to what the part stores wanted!!!
B003XZB54O|5|I bought this product to seal up leaks in my air compressor lines and it works great! Previously I had tried Teflon tape and pipe compound but neither did the job like Loctite 545. I wish I had bought this long ago! Great product!
B005FI1MAO|5|Excelente
B000688VNE|5|Well built product that can serve you for a very long time. You just can't go wrong with this jack. It has already proven its reliability and performance. Just make sure you purchase the geniun product.
B0000AY4MK|2|It is crooked, mismanufactured!
B005HFYE1O|5|Great for 12 circuits that require a relay for high current items such as headlights, horn, electric fans and any other electrical item that nay require a high current relay.
B000EQCV4I|5|Excellent
B000GTYV1O|5|Fits 05 honda 600 vlx perfectly looks good too! Won't blow off up to 102mph that's all I gave it lol
B00GHHU78A|5|A++++++!! Awesome product!
B00KTIQDMW|5|Worked perfect, much cheaper than the dealer....excellent deal!
B0080DT0JQ|5|excellent!!!
B00D7T4LX8|5|Got these for my mum who lives alone
B000C5SGA4|1|This sensor failed within 60 days.  Warranty is for 30 days, so no recourse.  Avoid product
B000YCCPM0|4|Always have had good luck with Weathertech products. These however did not like to stay in the truck windows. I lost 2 over the course of a year. (both on the interstate) The rear ones stayed in fine. Had to cross reference the part number through Weathertech to get just a front pair. Amazon vehicle part finder(check vehicle fit) is right next door to useless. Every auto part I buy on Amazon I research the manufacturers part # first and shop with it instead of Amazons system. Long story short the wind deflectors, I added some 2 sided tape to the problem areas where it slips out of the window channel and now all is good
B004I12438|5|Arrived next day! Easy to install
B00IKFJ0TE|3|The only issue I see is the main zipper, zipper  handle keeps getting stuck.
B007Y5L6JS|1|I'm not very pleased with this product after installation found out was not no grease in CV joints.It Would have been nice have a A label or something to tell you there was none in it or add some.good price you get what you get.local auto parts have them little more money but it done.
B0055DOOYK|5|High quality part at a great price.
B00NOL6RSG|5|I think I have an OK product. It looks a bit flimsy but that is OK. At this price, I should not be hoping for something even better. The installation was very easy and I did it in my own garage. And it has a lot of different patterns. So overall I am happy with it.
B002MQCY7C|4|works ok
B004HM2FUA|1|I had to order 5 fuses.....but only needed 2.ok fine so now I have a few spares. Had to wait 8 days for it to ship 400 miles. Finally they arrive.....3 of them are bad, don't work...but I did get the 2 I needed. And it only cost 5 bucks to buy and ship......
B005HR1K46|5|excelent
B000I2SWXC|5|Works great, keeps things from sliding around in the back.
B001TQMZWU|5|Love this rocker!
B004A6JA2O|5|Who knew the old cabin air filter was so clogged and nasty, bought this on a whim and was really happy that I did.
B000CLCF96|5|Very nice gasket. Arrived on time.
B000C7XSCI|5|Replaced old inoperative choke pulloff on a Holley 2bbl carb.
B00900NGFC|5|Solid tools, and you can't beat the price. The extended reach combined with the ball end is a great combination of features.
B000BXKZ6K|5|Used it with Permatex 80335 Muffler and Tailpipe Sealer to seal the the header collectors, mid-pipes, tailpipes and muffler connections on a 66 Mustang
B0065HI9UA|5|Works great
B000CIKC1C|5|good
B00MWQ6J7S|4|Not the same fit, but nice
B008XNZZ7O|3|Doesn't last long enough.
B0027Z6F3W|5|good price
B00T9AU9OO|4|Very bright, looks cool to. The only bad thing about this product is if you hit to big of a bump on the pavement, the lights turn off. After that you have to stop and turn them back on. Other than that its worth the money
B00OA66IG0|5|Awesome product, makes short work of cleaning even the most intricate car parts. Foam the car up, rinse it down. Scrub a little if needed. Highly recommend!!<br /><br />It fit right up to my power washer, created a huge amount of soap and cleaned quite well.
B0058J5012|5|champion
B006VFR2B8|3|Sturdy clamps but are small for most fire extinguishers.  Worked on the roll bar of the JEEP JK
B001DCESDY|5|This part was a perfect fit for my 2000 Mazda MPV driver door lock actuator. I found instructions online (with pics) and was able to remove the old part and replace it with this one with no issues... and it worked!
B004LAZE06|4|Great thanks
B000BYD9QW|5|In replacing my spark plugs, on my Mustang, I also replaced the wires with Motorcraft (WR5978 Tailored Wire set) featuring high quality jacket, to resist moisture, oil abrasion, and cracking due to engine heat or extreme cold temperature. The boots are designed to exacting ford specifications,They come ready to install, and two, and a half hours later, my car is tuned.
B004EBPKN8|1|Used on my 2010 Genesis Coupe 2.0T that stock with 14lbs of boost. Hooked this up, will not pass 6!! Don't go cheap but a real MBC!!
B007V2DM8W|5|The cover fits great.  It's easy to store and fold up,  it was much higher quality than any other windshield cover I've seen. I have one for both my truck and my navigator.
B00PBO0Z3M|5|Great fit!! Look great
B00DK8Y92O|5|Got these for my dad's Ram... It was fathers day when I got them for him. Air's still in the tires. Sweet.
B004GCEQ08|4|Fit my 98 Civic. No issues with shipping.
B004A2IFII|5|Great price! Quick delivery
B0000AXU02|5|Just as described.
B00U8NY348|5|Great product.  Sometimes the lever sticks though and doesn't open all the way.  I have many other devices like this one of different sizes and none have that problem but this one.
B0018EW56E|5|Installed with no issues.  Rode two trackdays over 300 miles of brutal accelleration on my 600.  The teeth still look new.  This is why i bought steel.
B009PJJHT2|5|Appears to fit perfectly.
B000CPI6VI|5|Fit perfect
B00480N0SC|5|very bright
B000FW7V50|5|Great stuff and I notice a difference when I don't add one to the tank of gas. I fill up once about every 10 days and this gallon will last me almost a year.  I think you get your money back in performance improvement.  I will buy another one next year.
B00IYNRT9A|5|The hitch install is not too difficult. It takes more time for a 2013 Civic because you have to remove, cut, and reinstall the underbody shield. It installs very solid and looks good when installed.
B00CKRKCMC|5|This is a great product. It's so much cheaper than Vinyl Wrap, but does same job! Although I'm not planning to, but the fact that it can be removed in the future is even more great. Definitely recommend this over Vinyl Wrap!
B003KKMC8K|5|Thanks they work great
B00AVQSFW8|4|I bought this cover for my 2015 Tiguan. Rather thin rubber. The key functions are not highlighted in white like my Gti cover. Overall gives it good protection.
B00C33DAPE|5|Great quality. Has been on my car for almost a year and has no issues with peeling.
B00V2XHMBY|4|Installed this on our 14' jon boat.. very bright.. good quality light for the money
B00AQAQI6E|1|None I if the bulbs work
B011K1IS7O|1|These lights come in a set of 10. I only just received them in the mail. I used the one light to read with for approximately 1 hour. I was under the light. I began to smell something burning. I touched the cover over the light it was extremely hot. I thought nothing of it. Then the light went out. I got up to check it and it all fell on top of me in pieces The solder had melted & the entire light had fallen apart. It fell on my right shoulder and burner the lower part of my neck. It made a small blister on me. I think this may be a faulty design. I think it has too many lights on it & it got so hot that the entire thing melted & fell apart into all the pieces that it is made from. This happened on the 1st time that I have used only one of the lights in my camper to read by.
B003S687OY|4|Nice key chain. Very satisfied
