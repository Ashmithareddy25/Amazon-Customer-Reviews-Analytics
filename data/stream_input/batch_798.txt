B000W4D94I|4.0|The movie Twister is one of my favorite \\"disaster movies\\". I have watched it 50 or more times.  The special effects are so cool and the acting is really good, especially Helen Hunt, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Jami Gertz. I have owned the regular DVD for some time and because I recently acquired a Blu-ray player and love the great picture and sound it affords, I decided to duplicate this movie and get the Blu-ray version.  I have to say that after watching it the first time I can't really tell that much difference in the Blu-ray compared to the standard wide-screen version and was a little disappointed in that.  I didn't think the resolution of the picture was as good as the other Blu-rays I have seen.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sound was a little better. As prices of Blu-rays continue to drop I will continue to purchase them in lieu of the standard ones, but right now they are still fairly pricey. BUT if you love Twister and have a Blu-ray player I still recommend you buy the Blu-ray because it is closer to the price of the standard DVD than many current releases and the sound alone is worth that little difference.
B00005TT77|1.0|received cd scratched so bad will not play, no jewel case, no liner notes. None of this was mentioned by the seller. Very dissatisfied.  Do not reccomend this seller. Will not purchase from this seller again.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Ok so TV is bad for a three year old ? Well if it is on ALL the time maybe sure. I find that this is a good can't find a thing on to wacth HAVE to get stuff done three year old pleaser! The screams and squeels of approval tell it all. I am guaranteed a few moments to cook or pay bills or pretty much get any really pressing thing done. There is one seen that bothers me though it is when the car tries to 'out run' a train! Ok, the car makes it unharmed, still, this I HAD to explain that he(and or the car) should NEVER do that in real life! We live not too far from the REAL rail road tracks ourselves. I guess my child got the message cause the other day he was sreaming \\"no don't do it\\" to the car on the movie \\"your gonna get sqashed!\\". Over all it is a good movie to see. Funny though, I don't think he has over seen the end of it, he ussually falls asleep before it is over. Me I have to chukle, tractor tipping... please... and Frank oh boy that's just to funny...
B000OY8NII|3.0|I am thoroughly captivated by this show, having missed the first two seasons and catching up with them on these two DVD sets. Even before I saw season 3 Episode one in HD on cable the other night, I was struck by the softness of the picture, which could not be improved by my upconverting Playstation 3. Displaying the details during playback confirmed that the average bitrate to be about 4Mbit per second, which indicates a very aggressive compression rate. This was likely necessary to squeeze 4 epsidoes onto one DVD.     At 10Mbs, a single layer DVD will hold 60 minutes of video.  At 5Mbs, it holds about 120 minutes.  That only 4-42 minute episodes at a total of about 4Mbs will fit on one DVD tells you that they are not even using dual layer DVD's!      Considering you are paying about $30 for a relatively short season show, there is simply no excuse for cheaping out and being so stingy with DVD's, which are very inexpensive. There should be no more than two episodes per disc, with an average bitrate of 8-9Mb, not 4.     This quality is even more unnacceptible considering the look of the show is simply amazing, with impressive artistic design and first-rate special effects. Even the scenery is breathtaking. If they cannot offer this show in BLu-Ray, they need to make the only available format looks as pristine as possible. High bitrate DVD can looks simply amazing. If I want the show to look as soft and fuzzy as this, I'll record it onto VHS.     This show is inventive, funny, poignant, and simply entertaining. It deserves better delivery.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is a darker, more realistic Batman movie.  For comic book fans who have read the earliest stories, this movie series should be heaven.<br />Christopher Nolan is taking audiences back to how Batman was intended to be: a dark master detective who is HUMAN.  His \\"villians\\" are crime bosses and mobster, just like in real life.  But Batman must also face madmen like Scarecrow.  The villians are more realistic (Nolan said you will never see the Penguin in his film series because it is too unbelievable and far fetched to be real).<br /><br />Begins is the beginning (which is refreshing given the slew of poor quality prequels that seem to be coming out lately).  We learn how Bruce Wayne altered from poor little rich boy into the vigilante of justice.  This film introduces the long standing comic villian of Ra's Al Ghul to film.  And Nolan (mistakenly) creates a love interest for Batman/Bruce Wayne in Rachel (played poorly by Katie Holmes).<br /><br />The story and the action are truly inspired.  And the direction this series is taking is from the original comic icon, not from the 4+ decades of camp and overacting.<br /><br />It's darker than Burton's, better than Schumacher's (but what isn't?), and true to the original.  What more could fans ask for?<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0017XD3OY|1.0|I was very disappointed in this movie and I was surprised that Will Smith aggreed to star in it.  It lacked credibility and it was not worth the money put into it.  I think I overated it by just giving it a star.  My impression it was a cheap knock off of resident evil with out as much action.
1604591625|4.0|Chesterton is difficult to read because he makes references to things and places that I do not know about but his work is still good reading.    If you don't get his point just keep reading and you soon will because he gives so many examples that sooner or later you will understand one and it becomes clear.
B000002GBB|5.0|Pieces of Eight is my favorite Styx album bar none. Some claim the album is a carbon copy of The Grand Illusion, that the lp shows no growth. I prefer to think that this cd improves on what The Grand Illusion attempted. On this cd we do not have an ANTHEM like Come Sail Away, and thank GOD for that. Also, every song on EIGHT is ENJOYABLE. Lords of the Ring is cool. Aku Aku is very mellow. Blue Collar Man and Renegade are TWO of Tommy's best songs. And Sing for the Day is another GEM. The Great White Hope is a slightly nerdy song but it's a lot of FUN and James Young is awesome singing the tune. And even Dennis rocks out vocally on Queen of Spades. And Pieces of Eight, the song, has a good positive THEME. All in all this is my favorite Styx cd. And thank GOD it doesn't have all of the drama of The Paradise Theater. God does that crap get too much air play. I mean, play something from EIGHT or some of the hits from Equinox or Crystal Ball. There are many gems on those two records.
B0016A2FFG|4.0|This is a fantastic CD from AL Green. It is heavy on the guest involvement, but does not suffer for that. Al is in good voice here, clearly feeling himself and does a great job.  Also enjoyable are the hints of his older, classic works, embedded in some of his vocal delivery and phrasings. There is lots of good material here and I am sure the live show with this material would be well worth the time!
B0018OAPAW|2.0|I'm a long-time Offspring fan, so I was dissapointed by this CD.  The first 4 tracks were really good, then the whole rest of the album really really sucked.  Seriously.  You've been warned...
B0019EXZYE|2.0|I was all hyped up to watch this movie. I read on some forum that I should go home and prepare to watch a fantastic movie. I bought the Blu-ray disc (BD) on Amazon and a couple of days later it arrived. Made dinner settled into my chair, fired up my 7.1 home theater and was unimpressed. I don't mind heavy British accents when the movie is good enough to put it aside.An example would be \\"The Full Monte\\" or Harry Potter, but this movie was lame. I don't care if it was based on a true story. The Great Escape was based on a true story and it was great. The execution of putting it down to film, the telling of the story if you will, was thin to say the least. The film maker attempts to peak your willingness to watch this flick with early on sexual scenes and with euro strip club, semi naked ladies in the backround as part of the area of operation. Did not work for me. The story doddles along until after a string of boring acts of implementation of the plan straining to come to a peak. It then turns to a semi who gets who first exercise, and then ends. Thank goodness. It is now one of my \\"I only watched it one time\\" BD's in my collection. For me it was a waste of money. The guy needed a shave too. You know how many Europeans have a particular odor when your standing next to them? This movie had the same smell.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Yes, Meryl Streep can sing - if you want a real treat, watch her in the movie \\"Postcards from the Edge\\" - she sings at the end of the movie and will blow you away.  In Mamma Mia I loved that Pierce Brosnan sang even though he is not a singer, but he can carry a tune and his songs are among my favorites. This movie was a joy to watch and the soundtrack makes me smile every time I hear it.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This CD is excellent. This band is one of the best. The songs are very well written and thought provoking but still well worth rocking out to. \\"Afterlife\\" and \\"Piece of Heaven\\" are my favorites. \\"Afterlife\\" has become an obsession of mine because of it's message and the way M Shadows sings and the guitar playing by Synyster Gates. These guys are very talented. \\"Piece of Heaven\\" is an adventure of a song and not what you might think from the title. It's crazy and wonderful. The rest of the CD is great and that's something I can rarely say. If you're looking for a different sound this is definitely worth it.
B0018AK9RK|3.0|As a long time fan I really didn't care too much for this release. Too self-indulgent.Halford's voice is as good as ever but,I think it was showcased a little too much with slow melodic songs. I prefer the hard driving Priest that we're used too. Nostradamus rocks a few times but,over all too mellow and self-indulgent.Bring back the metal!!!!!
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer is clearly one of the most talented young American musicians on the scene today.  Over the past 5 years, he has picked up some incredible blues chops and is becoming an even better entertainer.  He is very versatile in pop, blues, rock, and the sky is the limit for this 30-year old star.  John Mayer is relevant and has staying power.  Barring any tragedies, he should be on the scene for a long time.
B0012Q732O|3.0|Reviewed by MJ Twain<br /><br />(*NOTE* Some SPOILERS)<br /><br />A simple tribe of prehistoric hunters finds its way of life threatened when attacked by \\"four-legged demons.\\" Homes are burned and people taken to lands unknown. The village's best hunters take off in pursuit, becoming, as the narrator says, hunters no longer, but warriors.<br /><br />D'Leh, the lead character played by Steven Strait, is determined to rescue Evolet, the love of his life, along with the other hunters who were taken from the tribe, and without whom the people will starve. Thrust into the unasked-for role of Hero, D'Leh leads an army of many tribes to liberate thousands of captives-now slaves.<br /><br />Visually, this is a decent film. CG effects are well blended with the action, and the cast acted out their roles in an acceptable manner. That said, this movie left a lot to be desired. The plot is based on a tired storyline with predictable turns: Hero's village is attacked; Hero must rescue people; Hero displays special ability or fits prophecy; Hero faces danger; Hero wins, with minimal losses.<br /><br />One thing that annoyed me was that D'Leh seemed to care more about getting his girl back than anything else around him. He pulls it out in the end and even manages to care, but until that point, he is very one-dimensional.<br /><br />Hollywood loves its beasties. The production team behind 10,000 B.C. is no exception, with massive prehistoric monstrosities, which was the most impressive part of the movie. Mastodons (\\"Mannak\\"), a saber-toothed tiger (\\"Spear Tooth\\"), and a herd of two-story carnivorous emu-like birds provide some action-oriented eye candy. Other than that, however, the entire movies comes off flat.<br /><br />It's not horrible, but it's not great. If you have Netflix, go for it. Is it worth buying a copy? Not on my dime.<br /><br />3 Discs
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This movie is such a breathe of fresh air. I've seen it multiple times and the music just lifts your spirits. Meryl Streep is a legend and is awesome in this movie. Having this CD in your car is the perfect medicine for a rough day, and a party on a good day. I don't skip over any of the songs. If the CD had \\"Chiquita\\" and \\"Waterloo\\" then it would really be perfect.
0316143472|5.0|Awesome book, very funny. Laugh out loud funny, the whole way through. Going to order some other Sedaris books now!
B0017WI5VQ|3.0|I purchased this CD along with Duffy's 'Rockferry' and while Adele's '19' isn't on that level, I think its a very good CD.  Adele writes most of the material and it feels like a very personal album.  I enjoy the CD more everytime I hear it.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|A lovely adaptation of an Austen classic.  Poor Ann is portrayed wonderfully and her despair over her lost love will bring tears to your eyes.  The scenery is gorgeous and the other cast of characters is perfect.  If you liked Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, you will like this as well.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|The only guest appearance that matters is Anthony Hamilton 'layin down' a nice flow on a couple of tracks.  I like this set as much the last two releases if not a little more.  Al Green has that same smooth post-seventies sound he brought back with his release 'I Can't Stop' and continued on 'Everything's OK'.  If you dug those, you'll dig this one as well and vice versa.
1416524800|1.0|After I read The da Vinci Code I immediately picked up this book from Amazon.  The book started off very interesting and kept my interest until the plot started to take off.  About half way through the book it was very painful to read, everything about it was so far fetched.  The very first page of the book says that the technology in this book is real.  When you read the book you realize how stupid someone must be to believe that technology like this exists.  Its like The da Vinci code, where Dan Brown appears on television saying that the Priory of Sion is real and existed after Christ's death and is still around today, even after the Priory of Sion was proved to be a hoax, created in 1956.  Knowing that Dan Brown sincerely believes that these things exist in the world makes reading this book very difficult, at least for me.  Also, at the end where the assistant was bleeding in shark infested waters in a boat, and he urinates on himself to mask the \\"smell\\" of the blood to the sharks is simply ridiculous.  Sharks don't smell blood, they sense an enzyme that exists in blood.  Well, the enzyme also exists in urine, making that entire scene entirely impossible.  Dan tries to bring real world technology to make the story more interesting.  When I realized that he's making everything up, and says you to believe it because he says its true, I felt that he was insulting my intelligence.  From then on the read became a colossal waste of time.  Reading the da Vinci code made me want to read every book Dan Brown ever wrote, reading Deception Point makes me think twice about picking up a copy of Angels and Demons.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I have a six disc changer in my car.  Three CDs never leave the player - Dusty Springfield's 'Dusty in Memphis', the DVD-Audio Marvin Gaye 'Collection', and Elaine Elias' 'Dreamer'.  This will be the fourth.  I love this CD and the only song I skip on occasion is the radio hit 'Mercy' because you hear it all the time.  I tell everyone I know about this CD and play it for them if they'll listen.  I would say more than half stay around long enough to hear the whole CD; more than a few now own the CD themselves.
B001676320|5.0|I ordered this DVD when it was first advertised and waiting a long time for it. I have to say it was well worth it. Especially to see Chicogo and Earth Wind And Fire on the same stage performing so many of their great songs is very entertaining.The performances, and quality of the DVD is so good that you think you are actually watching a live performance.
B00006I53S|5.0|I have owned this lens for nearly a year now and am becoming increasingly fond of it.  I own several other lenses, but this is the one I now leave mounted on my Rebel XT almost all the time.  My love affair with this lens was not immediate, however.  At first I was somewhat disappointed with the image stabilization, but after working with it a bit I realized that it was my mode of operation that was at fault.  The stabilization doesn't kick in until you partly depress the shutter button (as you do to auto focus) and it takes a couple of beats before it gets up to speed.  Also, the lens has to be relatively still (or tracking smoothly) in order for the stabilization to work properly.  Initially, I was simply hurrying too much -- raising the camera and clicking off a shot.  Now I have learned to work with the lens by slowing down and anticipating the shot, and the results are much better. I recently had the challenge of taking pictures of a performance from the back of a darkened auditorium.  I cranked up the ISO to 1600 and carefully squeezed off my shots.  Despite the very low lighting, I got some really great shots even with the lens run out to the full zoom!  I think the thing I appreciate most about this lens is that the stabilization gives me just that much more stability to take photos with available light in difficult situations.  Of course, there is a limit to what the stabilization can do -- you still have to practice a steady hand and it can't compensate for motion of the subject -- so every shot doesn't come out perfect.  But the stabilization feature does greatly improve the odds of getting the shot you are trying for when you can't or don't want to use flash.  At this point, my only \\"negatives\\" about the lens are that it is fairly heavy for lugging around and I wish I had a little more wide angle capability (the 60% crop factor of my XT makes it effectively a 47-225mm lens).  On the vanity side, it's an impressive looking piece of hardware (especially if you fit it with the Canon hood) and the heft of the lens balances well in the hand.  All things considered, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.f you fit it with the Canon hood) and the heft of the lens balances well in the hand.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|With action, adventure, spaceships, great actors, love stories, comedy, amazing characters, and plot stories from fun to thought-provoking, this series has something for everyone. Joss Whedon really out-did himself on this one. This series became a victim of Fox's money-hungry exec's, but once you've seen Firefly, you'll be just as peeved as all of us other \\"Flans\\" are that this work of art wasn't allowed to continue expanding our universe and minds.
B0018AK9RA|2.0|I received this with 2 disc 2s and no disc 1 so I don't know what the first disc is like.  I found most of the songs to be rather ponderous whilw a few had good moments.  The slow pace of all the songs sounds like they are having trouble playing anything with a normal tempo.    If you want to listen to a fun take on Nostradamus, check out the 2-CD epic by Kayak - [[ASIN:B0009N5S7S Nostradamus: The Fate of Man]] - but look for prices under $28.
B0017MO10U|5.0|First off, this movie is an introduction to the Stargate franchise for me; I know the series appears to be coming to the end, I intend to purchase the series. There fore there are many questions to be answered for me.<br /><br />The movie itself had me captivated from beginning to end and I feel regardless of whether anyone has seen the series, this particular movie is captivating and inviting to viewers ignorant of the original series. In my view the main characters Jackson, Mitchell, Carter and Anderson possess average acting skills. Ba'al & Tealc are excellent. The plot was well planned and being a time travel fan my interest was obviously heightened by the story line. For the most part the effects are very good. (With a few glitches here and there.)<br /><br />If you have never watched this Stargate series before I suggest you check this movie out.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|I dare anyone of a \\"certain age\\" not to sing along and dance, and for anyone else not to want to dance!    A joyous and colorful movie (anybody want to go to Greece soon?)  Meryl Streep has more energy and presence than any 20-something pop star.  Christine Baranksi is a miracle.  Julie Walters is so funny and has one of the best numbers.    Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag, but he gives it his all.  Colin Firth...oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.    Go the movie on a crowded Saturday night, and whatever you do, DO NOT leave until the movie is really, really over!
B001ACY8D2|4.0|I thought the new Sigur Ros cd was fresh and amazing.  Since I have bought it, I have listen to it once a day.  The album is not up to the same sounds as their last album.  But it brings in a new and fresh air of noises.  In this album the band has used a wilder tone to the notes.  Everytime I listen to the album I can image the forest or a place of solitudes being invaded by the explores of the world.   I am happy to say that this album is a great sound wave of beauty.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|When I first heard about this I thought it was going to be some sort of documentary on trans people in the US. Last night I watched it with a friend when it came on Lifetime and was pleasantly surprised. I think the title could also have been more descriptive of the actual plot. This movie's depictions of both a transgender person, their family and a sexually abused teenage boy was all very accurate and well done. The movie makers didn't seem afraid to go anywhere, and pulled off intense dramatic moments as well as some comical situations and dialogue. However, I gave it only 4 stars because there were a few scenes and parts of the movie that could have been improved, as well as the title issue.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|After playing this disk several times, I have realized there's not much there. I know they put a lot of energy and thought into it, but this material will not stand up to the test of time -- in another year few will listen to it or even remember it.<br /><br />I ended up selling my used CD on Amazon for $6 and was glad to get it.

B0012Q732O|2.0|Roland Emmerick who directed \\"Independence Day\\" creates another epic scale film with \\"10,000 B.C.\\"  Steven Strait who I enjoyed in [[ASIN:B000K4WPCC The Covenant]] does a good job as the lead D'Leh who goes in search of his lost love.  While I fully enjoyed [[ASIN:B0009VRHNI The Ballad of Jack and Rose]] with Daniel Day Lewis, I did not recognize Camilla Belle until I started looking at her credits.  As Evolet, she is certainly the belle of the ball at this tribal gathering.  Mona Hammond does a nice job as the Old Mother.  New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis who was in [[ASIN:B000R4SMCW Fracture (Widescreen Edition)]] does well as the faithful Tic Tic.  This film about the Yaghal tribe falls apart as the story becomes so farfetched.  However, the cinematography made it pretty to look at.  Two weeks after I saw the film, I struggled to recall much about it; so I think it probably is forgettable.  Belle & Strait are worth watching.  Taxi!
B0009SOFFY|5.0|One of the best hard rock albums of all time.  This album and the Stooges 1st album (self titled) are rock masterpieces.  Iggy Pop et al do it good on this album.     Definetly a top ten'er!!

0803732287|5.0|We are huge fans of Julia Donaldson's books, having been introduced by friends in the UK.  And honestly, we can't understand why the US publisher insists on changing Julia Donaldson's titles and text to \\"American-ize\\" it. The British versions are far more lyrical and rhythmic. Is \\"Where's My Mom?\\" truly a better title than \\"Monkey Puzzle?\\"  Does the publisher really think we need to translate \\"Monkey Puzzle\\" because we won't understand it on this side of the pond?   Room on the Broom, The Gruffalo, Monkey Puzzle and Tiddler (\\"The Fish Who Cried Wolf\\" - really? That's a better title??) all have changes to the US text that make them a bit less appealing if you've read the British texts. We love to give these as gifts but prefer to give the British versions.

B00005JPY0|5.0|This movie is what I wanted Batman to be in the 60's (I hated the tv series). Too bad Ledger died since he will be difficult to replace in the next installment.    Great special effects for Harvey Dent (Two-Face)!  I was sorry that Michael Caine's role is diminished from the first movie as he really shines when he is on screen.  Look for the Scarecrow's return at the very beginning of the film.
B0019HQIGS|4.0|It is John Mayer.  Whether you like him or hate.  He has plenty of solos whether it was his acoustic stuff/ jazz/ blues, it was all there and plenty of it.  It looked good and sounded better.  Had a good variety of his music and displayed some of his best stuff.      Personally, I don't know what is so great about Gravity.  The lyrics are great but I just feel the song never takes off.  It is kinda blah the entire song.  Other than that, every song is spot on.  Just buy it.      If you have a blu-ray player, don't skimp out.  But the Blu-ray.  Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with the dvd and its 5.1 audio.  If you have good speakers the music will image great.  The rears are purely for fan noise and ambiance.

0435131001|5.0|Not to give away the WHOLE entire book like some other reviewers... I love Pratchett, this book is so smart and cleverly funny but also horribly dark in spots. You find yourself loving these characters and it's only a short book. If you love books about talking intelligent animals (Watership Down,Rats of Nimh, Firebringer) you'll love this book. The best is the always clever, quick witted Maurice who holds the best and worst characteristics a hero can. I loved this book and have read it multiple times and would suggest it for young and older readers.

Of course these guys are none of those, but what I'm saying is that they are creatively moving rock forward, and they will one day be part of classic rock.

The story was a classic detective story in which Batman looks for a Holiday Killer dubbed \\"Holiday\\" who is killing off gangsters on holidays. It is truly a detective story genre and as like previous reviewers mentioned it has the whole \\"Rogue Gallery\\" cast throughout the story and if your not a true die hard batman collector like myself the story is interesting because the killer is not who you expect at the end and yes there are gangsters and shootings. The origin tale of Two Face is intertwined in the story as well so that is an added bonus for many.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|It's a very decent mount. Comes with everything you need. I wish it had a longer extension arm. And the arms are somewhat stiff when you try to move the screen.
B00144VBBS|4.0|While not very familiar with Toby Keith's music, I knew I liked some of his songs.  This album gives a great variety of styles, lyrics, etc.  He has a unique way of putting lyrics together - and uses interesting ways to combine music, rhythm, and presentation to get your attention.  While not a country-western fan, I found I really liked this album.
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I was really prepared not to like this film as I have grown tired of Felicity Huffman's pathetic overacting on \\"Desperate Housewives, \\" but in this quiet, affecting road trip film she underplays beautifully and accomplishes more by acting less. As Bree, the conflicted pre-op transsexual, Ms. Huffman lowers her voice an octave and wears heavy makeup to make her character authentic. I did think throwing every family dysfunction in the mix was a bit much, but Bree's relationship with her parents who called her \\"Stanley\\" was touching and real. A key element to this films success is an impressive soundtrack that adds to the ambience. Watch for the wonderful Grahame Greene in a small role.
B00133KFGW|3.0|I've seen great movies without a fraction of the potential storyline of this one. The idea for this movie was great!  Unfortunately, this movie wasn't. In almost every aspect of the movie, I feel the final product fell way short.  The story was developed very poorly, probably made worse by poor direction and bad editing. All I know is I didn't believe any of it. I didn't understand the notoriety surrounding the mother musician; her character was never developed so one could believe in her ability. They added to the disbelief by the few times they showed Keri Russell \\"playing\\" the cello; she didn't fake it very well... they could have done that better.  And I can think of a dozen of actors that have more musical ability and presence than Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He can't play, he can't sing, and the song they chose for him to \\"write\\" sucked. The actors conveyed no passion for their music or the feeling that music was really a part of them; Although I tried, I could never fool myself to believe they were musicians.  August (Freddie Highmore) was more convincing, but even he was way too deadpan and passionless (except occasionally when he was playing). Robin Williams had more passion and feeling than everyone else in the movie put together, but even his character seemed fragmented and untrue.  The story was developed poorly from beginning to end. This is so disappointing considering the potential this story had. The idea of music being all around us and in everything is powerful and compelling, and the idea of a prodigy like August developing and becoming public is thrilling. But this movie didn't convey these ideas well at all and was about the least powerful and compelling or thrilling movie I've seen in awhile.  This movie had no ring of truth to it at all.  The final production seemed rushed, superficial, disjointed, unconvincing and amateurish.  Although the movie was O.K., I was very disappointed.

0446402389|3.0|I was disappointed with the idea behind the murderer's motives. It seems the author didn't think it through, letting the action scenes steer the wheel. The one book that really exceeds expectations in this particular genre is 'The Alienist' by Caleb Carr.

B0019IB26I|2.0|I have john mayer, and i love all kinds of music, but this guy bugs me.  He's getting credit as a \\"genius\\" when there are literally HUNDREDS of artists better than his simplistic, formulaic, drivel. I really just don't know how he made it.  Good marketing i suppose,and people that can't recognize authentic music when they hear it. Actually, come to think of it..I gave him two stars to many.
0140620516|4.0|What an intensely sad moral fable. In some ways I thought it similar to 'The Invisible Man' by HG Wells. Both narratives express a keen interest in science, and warn in their own way of the danger of transgressing the borders or what one may call moral or ethical acceptability and experimentation.  The clever Dr Jekyll invents a potion which allows him to temporarily change his appearance, age and nature, in order to live a life of villainy without fear of detection. From that point onwards all goes awry, unitl eventually the hideous transformation (Mr Hyde) begins to take over Dr Jekyll's natural self.   Dotted with beautiful use of language, \\"Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged\\", although at times (after all it's Victorian) somewhat laborious.   Interestingly Stevenson's narrative reads unemotionally, even though the content is so highly charged. Different viewpoints are used in the book, allowing Dr Jekyll the final words which explain all. Mr Hyde is never allowed a voice, reinforcing the victory of good over evil, even though the only possible outcome is the death of both Jekyll and Hyde, naturally.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan, so was very skeptical before I saw this movie!  I didn't think I would like a whole movie of other more or less unknown artists singing Beatles songs.  I was not expecting much.  Imagine my wonderfully pleasant surprise of seeing this movie, and absolutely loving it, esp. hearing the songs sung by others.  All of the singers/actors were compelling, appealing and excellent in this well-told, imaginative tale based on the Beatles/'60s narrative.  Three cheers to Julie Taymor and all of the artists in the movie for a wonderful job.  It's great having it on DVD so I can sing along to my heart's content now, too!
B000002U8G|5.0|This album is as good as Floyd classics, but never gets mentioned the same breath as Dark Side of the Moon or the ones that followed it.  It's an extraordinarily well made album, brilliantly sequenced, written, and performed.  It's also a true Floyd album, with all band members contributing to the songwriting.  It starts with the amazing, scary One of These Days.  The next song, A Pillow of Winds, is one of Floyd's most beautiful ballads.  San Tropez is cute and beautiful, and Seamus, which sounds like a throwaway, nevertheless is good.  The best song is the side long, epic Echoes (here in its full length 23 minute version.  The version on the greatest hits CD Echoes has been edited!).  It's an amazing song, with some of Waters's best lyrics and beautiful vocals from Gilmour and Wright (who, honestly, sang better than Waters ever did, but didn't write lyrics like he could).  Many people love to say you should get stoned while listening to this song, I say no.  Stay sober and get stoned by the song.  Echoes is a great epic track, as good as anything put out by Yes, King Crimson, or ELP.  This is an unjustly underrated album in Floyd's catalog, and is actually one of their best.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|As an amateur radio operator I was looking for a headset that did was of some quality, lightweight, and did not totally isolate me from the other sounds in the room. I have been using a pair of AKG K240 Studio headphones for over a year and find them to be the most comfortable headphones I have ever tried. They are light and the ear pieces cup your ears just enough to keep out ambient noise, but don't smash your ears into the side of your head. After hours of wear, you really can't tell you have them on. The dynamic range and sound reproduction is superb. Yes, they are full range, but they reproduce the human voice and the frequency range for CW (800-2K Hz) perfectly which is what I want in a pair of communication headphones.<br /><br />I can say that after much research the other reviewers were 100% correct.

B000FZETKC|5.0|As a 17 year old high school senior, I often wish I would have grown up in the time my parents did, simply for all the awesome movies like Some Kind of Wonderful. For as long as I can remember I've been watching Pretty in Pink and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as well as any other 80s teen movies I can get my hands on. For some reason, I had never seen Some Kind of Wonderful until recently when I went to Target and was in awe to see an 80s section of dvds. Some Kind of Wonderful is comparable to Pretty In Pink, and is an extremely good movie that teenagers, no matter what decade they were born in, whether it be the 60s or the 90s, can relate to.

0321525655|5.0|PresentationZen isn't really a book about specific techniques; it's about understanding and applying simple principles from Zen to your overall approach to, preparation for, design of, and delivery of your message.<br /><br />Garr Reynolds invites the reader into his mind as he prepares a presentation.  We see his narrowing down the presentation to a core message, then fleshing out the ideas on white board flows, paper storyboards, and post-its.  He explains there are three parts of the presentation - the slides, your notes, and the handout - and how each is approached very differently.  He speaks out against what's now acceptable as a \\"slideument,\\" and how slideumentation is killing presentations at conferences and perpetuating the \\"Death By PowerPoint\\" phenomenon.<br /><br />When he gets to design, he illustrates how three Zen principles - Kanso (Simplicity), Shizen (Naturalness), and Shibumi (Elegance) - can work together to create slides that help convey your message.  Other non-Zen principles (design, story, symphony, empathy, play, meaning, enthusiasm, and surprise) are also thoroughly discussed throughout the book, and ultimately applied to his slide design.<br /><br />Okay, I said the book is about principles rather than techniques... that doesn't mean there is no technique in the book.  About half way into the book, Garr shifts into technique and starts showing before and afters to illustrate how the techniques are used to apply the principles.  The difference between this book and other \\"before and after\\" books is that Garr doesn't just show you one bad example followed by the fix; instead he shows a set of bad slides covering the same content, and a set of different ways the principles and techniques can be applied.  There are many pages of example after example (many contributed by other designers and presenters) - if Garr had just published these alone, the book would be worth the price.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who designs, creates, and/or delivers presentations.  It is a beautifully crafted book, and provides an insight into a presentation master's mind.  Having said all that, here is my only negative comment on the book... too often (especially in the first half of the book), I feel the prose overwhelmed the message.  I know another reviewer commented on the lack of text (as if adding text increases the value of a book), but when your message is simplify, the same principles should have been applied to the writing of the book.ons.

B000BKJ78U|3.0|If you like the edits Lucas made to this classic trilogy, then you can upgrade my review by one or two stars.  If you agree that he should have left them alone, then I think 3 stars is fair:    I have little to add to what other reviewers have said, other than that while George has the right to remake the original movies, it would be nice to buy the original releases.  I enjoyed the original films immensely, and agree that although the technology was not up today's standards, they possessed a certain charm in spite of, or because of, that.  I was going to buy the DVD set of the movies to replace my VHS tapes, but have realized that unless Lucas decides to release the original footage without his \\"improvements,\\" I really am not interested in owning them.
B00007J4SI|4.0|Ponti's Scriabin IS no longer THE most complete set of Scriabin's piano music ever issued (that record now belongs to Maria Lettberg, with her set of the works with opus numbers for Capriccio, and her subsequent CD of the posthumous works.), but it comes close. True, VOX's labeling is confusing-as another reviewer stated, this set and Ponti's set of the sonatas should really be labeled \\"Vol.I and Vol.II.\\" I don't blame other customers for being confused!<br /><br />Ponti is a great Scriabin player, period. Unfortunately, his recording of the sonatas is one of the great tragedies of recorded music. The sound accorded his sonatas is virtually unlistenable-fryingly over bright treble and boomy bass--it sounds like it was recorded by someone used to recording rock. The recording engineer should be taken out and shot!<br /><br />It's a tragedy, because the playing is marvellous. The other pieces in that set and the present set are much more listentably recorded. The sound of the present set is better, and not nearly so bad as some reviewers would have one believe. With some fiddling at the tone controls, it can be rendered quite listenable. I found that adjusting the tone controls to treble at 9:00 and bass at 10:00 renders everything except the sonatas much easier to take.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if one wants Ponti's Scriabin complete (even if one chooses to supplement his sonatas with something in better sound) one has to buy both this set and his set of the \\"Complete Piano Music\\" on five CD's. That's actually not so bad--the sets are cheap enough.<br /><br />However, if merely getting the complete Scriabin is your goal, there are alternatives.<br /><br />1. There's a really excellent 8-disc set of all Scriabin works with opus numbers available on Capriccio played by Maria Lettberg. This is really first-rate, and can form the basis of your Scriabin collection [[ASIN:B000W4E3OS Das Solo-Klavierwerk]]. The set can also be downloaded as MP3's from the NAXOS website.<br /><br />2. Two possibilities here: Lettberg doesn't play any of the posthumously-published early Scriabin. Most of this is available on Coombs's CD, \\"The Early Scriabin,\\" ([[ASIN:B000OQF58C The Early Scriabin]].). Unfortunately, he omits the early \\"Albumleaves\\" in F-sharp and A-flat and the Fantasy for Two Pianos. All of the pieces Coombs plays plus everything he doesn't are in Ponti's set called \\"Complete Piano Music\\". The sound of this set can be rendered fairly listenable with the tone controls.<br /><br />To sum up: Get Lettberg's set. Add the early works she doesn't play with Coomb's \\"The Early Scriabin\\", OR, (for absolute completeness) from the present set by Ponti. And oh, yes, you might want another set of the sonatas--these pieces are so multi-faceted that you might want more than one interpretation-my personal favorite is Hamelin.<br /><br />RE the Sonata in E-flat minor: This work has come down to us unfinished. Although I personally prefer Ponti's completion of the unfinished slow movement to Glemser's or Coombs's, his recording is rather out of the running because he plays the wrong first movement--i.e., the revised version of the first movement as the \\"Allegro appassionato, Op.4\\"--how did THAT happen?<br /><br />I hope this helps!n't play any of the posthumously-published early Scriabin.

B0017I1FNK|5.0|When I first heard this CD, I wasn't ready for it.  I put it away.  But as a 20 year fan of Emmylou Harris -- knowing what she is capable of -- I couldn't just ignore it, and eventually I started playing it again.  Now, I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM.  On this CD she has returned to her musical roots and the tradition that has founted her songwriting, but in her own unique way.  This isn't some backward-looking album; there is a subtle nuancing of the traditional country sound, here.  I can hear echoes of \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" but also \\"Red Dirt Girl.\\"  _A beautiful sadness pervades the music; a connecting of themes--esp. loss of love and an awareness of mortality looming.  This CD is truly an \\"album,\\" too, as it's not just an amorphous grouping of random songs.  Finally, I would say, her songwriting continues to evolve, as on \\"How she could sing the wildwood flower.\\"  If you know the original song (\\"Wildwood Flower\\"), you will hear how she is playing with the melancholy of that song in her own lyric's story.  An EXCELLENT album!  All I can say is, \\"Immerse yourself in it!\\"

B00003CX8Y|4.0|Ever since i was a little girl i loved this movie and hailed it as my favorite disney movie. And even now this is a movie can watch over and over again. The new dvd version gives better sound and visual quality, especialy in comparison to it's VHS counterpart. However i do have one small complaint.  When watching, if you want to watch your favorite classic version without the crappy new song 'human again' you have to go and select the original theatrical version from the main menu.  It is horrible mostly when you are showing this movie to one of your younger cousins or siblings who haven't seen the mvie yet, and you want them to get the good experience, with all the songs you love. Not the okay experience with MOST of the songs you loved but that one near the end which was not nearly as good as the others.  over-all, i love this movie, but just make sure to select the theatrical version from the main menu for the best experience
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Finally!  Mad Men proves that television doesn't have to be hackneyed storylines and writing.  At first glance, this series serves as an interesting portrayal of a period that is beginning to fade from cultural memory.  However, it will only take an episode or two to begin to appreciate the poignant themes and writing.  Each character is complex - there are parts of each that you love and hate - sometimes at the same time.  It's amusing to see the situations and themes that we hope don't exist today, but many ideas and circumstances that are universal to most people, regardless the time.      It's such a pleasure to finally find a series that justifies taking time out my schedule to sit back and take in.  The acting is top notch and the costuming and sets are superb.  I think a blog I recently read captured it best - \\"I spend more time thinking about what I saw, then actual time watching the show.\\"  Now, that's saying something!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|This is THE dancing movie!  The dancing outshines every aspect of this movie that you don't even remember what the story was about.  I loved that there was dancing everywhere.  That's what a dance movie should be, shouldn't it?  Rather than making the antsy viewer wait 'til the finale to enjoy some real dancing.<br /><br />To comment on the acting and directing - in all honesty, it was not too shabby at all.  Obviously, they weren't going for the oscars but then the movie IS about kids from the streets who have passion for dancing.  The movie generally stays true to the spirit of that - and the credit goes to the actors and the director.  I was especially impressed with Rob Hoffman and Cassie.  Rob Hoffman, known for his edgy pranks, was very believable in his role.  Cassie, singer turned actor, also surprised me with her portrayal of Sophie - I thought she would bomb like many other singer turned actor.<br /><br />Back to my point - step up and watch this movie!
B00005JLSE|4.0|I admit I never saw the stage musical so the plot and characters were new to me.  Nonetheless, Chicago is a rollicking, foot-tapping, hot musical that doesn't apologize for its direction and content.  Roxie Hart is a naive but strong-willed young woman who's determined to be famous.  Velma Kelly is a veteran of the stage but is sparsely rewarded despite her dedication and talent.  The two eventually collide when Roxie begins winning hearts (and the press) with her story while Velma must face the reality that she's yesterday's news.  The slick lawyer not only must juggle Roxie's front page case but also the restless Kelly who is chagrined that even her own attorney begins to turn his back on her.  This movie is not for everyone, musicals rarely are, but to those who enjoy a well-developed story with never boring characters this film is a must.  A well-deserved best picture nod.

The actors are phenominal, including the comical Donald O Connor, the robust Ethel Merman, and the seductive Marilyn Monroe, as charming as ever. If you enjoy musicals, this is a must. There is all different types of music, and an array of performers. Marilyn portrays her role fantastically and she offers a few chuckles, too. She sings some great songs, one of my favorite being \\"Heat Wave\\", and there's plenty of dancing in there too. Bright, colorful, and fun, this is a movie for everyone.
B000YD7S2Q|4.0|I just purchased this, and though much has already said of the performers (particularly Schnaut, Studer, and Frey--all described accurately by other reviewers), I felt the need to review this positively to offset the reviewer who gave this production two stars because they disliked the ending.<br /><br />\\"Regietheater\\" (director's theater) in opera is nothing new. This production, for the most part, is traditional. Only the true purists would complain. Heck, the Bayreuth '82 DVD production doesn't even have a swan. The swan in this seems a little out of place, but ih. . .at least it's *there*. We live in a world where Valkyries ride invisible horses and Wagner's stage directions are only \\"suggestions.\\" Feel grateful the chorus isn't dumping soup on the stage.<br /><br />I love Cheryl Studer's Elsa (the highlight of this production) and Schnaut's Ortrud, though not the best I've heard, is very well acted. Frey as Lohengrin can't really. . .er, act. . .but his voice is all right, and Lohengrin only has a big part to play in Act 3, so for the first two acts he isn't as annoying as he could be. All in all, I'd recommend this far and above the Met version and *any* version with Placido Domingo in it. (I know his German has improved in recent years, but my God!) This isn't my favorite version--that goes to the '83 Bayreuth DVD--but is definitely worth adding to any Wagner collection.
B001ACY8D2|4.0|Late 2007 felt like the end of Sigur Ros' first chapter (after an amazing 10 year run), with the release of the gorgeous \\"Heima\\" DVD and the almost simultaneous 2CD release of Hvard/Heim, in which the band cleaned out of some of its archives, along with some tracks from the Heima DVD sessions. The question was, what would be next for Sigur Ros? We already have the answer with this album, recorded quickly in January-April 2008 and released not long thereafter, lightning fast by industry standards.<br /><br />\\"Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust\\" (11 tracks, 56 min.) immediately announces itself as the new Sigur Ros with the opener, short but poppy \\"Gobbldigook\\", followed by a similar \\"Inne Mer Syngur Vitleysingur\\"... what a departure for the band. You have to wait until tracks 5 \\"Festival\\" to find anything similar to what the band has produced, and even then it feels different as the 9+ min. plays as 2 tracks in one (slow first half, hard charging second half). The album features mostly acoustic guitars and piano (albeit augmented at times with brass, of all things, and choir), but what is really striking is the complete absence of Birgisson's patented electric guitar-whaling (as I like to call it), which used to be the band's signature sound. There is no electric guitar to be heard here, none. Much is made of the last track, \\"All Alright\\", the band's first song featuring English lyrics, but the pitch of the vocals is so slow that you can't make out any of the words anyway and might just as well been in Icelandic or Hope-landic (I had to look up the lyrics on the internet to make sure what the words said).<br /><br />In all, this is quite a departure for Sigur Ros, but I really like the album, and have been playing this non-stop. I've seen Sigur Ros in concert a number of times, most recently at Bonnaroo in June, where they delivered a fabulous 1 AM set, playing mostly older songs, but a couple of the new album as well. This band is fascinating to follow, and I can't wait to see where Sigure Ros will go from here.here Sigure Ros will go from here.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|We were lucky enough to be able to attend one of Donna Summer's concerts this past weekend.   It was truly an incredible event. The crowd went wild when she sang her old songs. They were  literally dancing in the aisles. \\"They\\"  being the baby boomers who are now in their 50's and 60's.   She sang a bunch of songs from her new Crayons album. It was great to see that she still had it.   It was a small concert hall holding only 400 people. It was more intimate than a large concert venue.  She took the time to explain how she came to  write each song on the new album. I ran out the next  day to buy Crayons and have listened to it continually since. Buy it, play it ...   It will put a smile on your face.  The Queen IS back.
0375423877|5.0|These books are not serious fiction,  finely constructed mysteries or the greatest books ever written on Africa.   Instead, they are a quiet, gentle and heartwarming series of vignettes that provide insight into the human condition and a peak at the Africa of Botswana.  Further, they are not entirely saccharine either as they touch on issues such as domestic violence and the trials and tribulations of serious poverty.  Yet at the end of each of these books, I always feel better. This is a rare combination indeed.      I tend to read what most people would consider \\"serious\\" fiction and nonfiction.  You will more often than not find me curled up with something by Camus, Nietzsche or Borges.  Rose-colored glasses are not my style and it took an insistent friend to get me to read this first volume.   I now gladly admit to being seduced by Smith's deceptively simple prose and characters.      These books are meant to be read at the beach or bedtime and later passed on to friends.  Gentle wisdom is best undertaken gently.  If you can approach these books in the spirit I believe Smith intended, then you might be find in them something sorely missing in this world of ours.

The all-star lineup on this recording is unbeatable, and the beautiful sound quality makes it a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />For the bridging of avant-gard jazz, free jazz, and traditional blues, this masterpiece provides a wealth of historical and stylistic information and musical inspiration.<br /><br />What else can I say? Get it!
B00154GEFU|2.0|GOOD: These good musicians got back together again - thanks guys! Songs \\"Never Again\\" and \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" are pretty good, but otherwise not enough good songs in between. If I bought this again, I would just have downloaded those two songs. I do like that some of the lyrics try to be uplifting and positive.    BAD: Too soft and mushy. Also kind of boring. Has a somewhat bubble gum, \\"pop\\" production to it, tied to the keyboards I think. It doesn't feel like a rock CD to me. Their first album sounded more rock-like with its songs and production. Is John Wetton the softie who sets the tone like this? He does have a great voice though.    Overall I really wanted to like this CD but it's just not doing it for me. I'd love for these guys to make another one and try rocking out a little bit - I know Steve and Carl can do that.
B000RG1FMO|1.0|This is not a review as such of Kanye West's \\"Graduation\\" album. Not a whole lot more that I can say about the album that hasn't been said somewhere in the hundreds of other reviews here. Instead, I wanted to comment on the disaster that was Kanye's performance at Bonnaroo in June, which I witnessed first hand.<br /><br />Kanye was originally scheduled to perform at 8:15 PM Saturday evening, at the same time that Jack Johnson was scheduled to perform on the main stage. Claiming that he wanted to make sure it was dark enough for his stage show, Kanye requested that his set be moved to a 2:45 to 4 AM slot at the main stage (even though by 8:30 Central time, it's pretty much complete darkness). His request was granted (this was the first time ever that such a late performance would be held at the main stage). The headliners of the evening, Pearl Jam, ran over by 30 min. and finished their set at exactly 1 AM. Then the waiting started. 2:45 AM came and went with no sign of Kanye. The waiting went on and on and on... People were getting very frustrated, for obvious reasons. Lots of people simply left. Finally, at 4:25 AM, Kanye came on stage, no explanation given, no \\"thanks for hanging in there\\", like nothing was wrong. The set started with \\"Good Morning\\", and how appropriate it was as dawn started to break. By the time Kanye finished at 5:25 AM, it was complete daylight. So much for glow in the dark!<br /><br />I had heard a lot about the Glow in the Dark tour, and was very curious to see what the brouhaha was all about. Well, color me mightily disappointed! The 'special effects' came across cheaply, for one. Separate from the faux pas for not apologizing for being so late, the show is just a one man performance, dancing and singing to pre-taped music (not a single 'live\\" instrument), just like on the Disney channel! Very disappointing. Later I read that Kanye blamed the fiasco on the Bonnaroo organizers \\"who clearly don't know how to put on a show\\". Sure, Kanye! Me personally, I think that \\"Kanye don't like white people\\"...ink that \\"Kanye don't like white people\\"...

B000002N2N|5.0|If you prefer your rock and roll loud, fast, sloppy, and passionate, then, you are likely to agree with my opinion that the Ramones are far superior live than they were in the studio.  So, when you are ready to purchase a Ramones' album, make sure it is a live performance and not a studio album or a greatest hits collection.  You have a choice to make...      Stay away from [[ASIN:B000002LQ1 Loco Live]].  The one good thing about that cd was that, because it was recorded in 1990, it has some good songs that aren't on the two CDs I'll mention soon.  For instance, \\"I Wanna be Sedated\\", \\"KKK Took my Baby Away\\", \\"Rock and Roll Radio\\", \\"Wart Hog\\", etc. Besides for that, Loco Live is inferior in every way to two other live albums you should choose from.    IT'S ALIVE and [[ASIN:B0001902EY Live January 7, 1978 at the Palladium, NYC]] have much in common.  In case you didn't know, It's Alive was recorded on New Year's Eve, London, 1977.  NYC 1978 was recorded a week later at the Palladium in New York City.  The exact same set of songs are to be found on both of the albums.  The set contains all the early hits of the Ramones first three studio albums.  Live, the songs are played (1) faster, (2) looser...basically it sounds like punk rock.      Personally, I would get both of the above mentioned.  But if you have to get just one, then you have a decision to make.      NYC 1978 has far and away the better sound quality of the two.  If `lo-fi' recordings are not your thing, go with NYC.  Joey's vocals are louder and more distinguishable -- more distinct from everything else.  Theirs less crowd noise than there is in It's Alive.  The rhythm section is similarly more prevalent in the NYC recording.  It's Alive is dominated by  treble-heavy guitar riffs; everything seems to bleed together into one loud and fast noise. It's merely speculation, but perhaps they were f***** up on New Year's Eve.      The New Years may be the more inspired performance. Risks were taken; Joey alters the timing of his delivery: an experiment that produced the best renditions of their songs to be found anywhere.  Personally, I like the Lo-Fi - I think it works perfect for the Ramones.      I like It's Alive better.  But I also know people who hate It's Alive, but like the NYC live.  You can sample a small clip of each (either on Amazon, or i-tunes); a small sample is all you will need to tell which one you will prefer.
044661758X|5.0|I have recently re-read this (I first read it in the late '90s after Michael Connelly was recommended by a friend) and I have to say MC has never failed to disappoint, \\"Concrete Blonde\\" included.  I love that Michael Connelly can write \\"gotcha\\" mysteries with failed, real characters.  If Bosch were real living/breathing person, I would be honored if I could count him as one of my friends.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Okay, I was already determined to love this album when I found out that Renee Fleming stars in three of it's pieces. But Howard Shore truly does provide a gorgeous presentation of his musical talents. Keeping in mind that this is a movie track, and therefore, there is a lot of \\"incidental\\" music in this album. It's not always riveting without the action of the movie to complete the story. But that is a challenge every composer of film music faces.<br /><br />Flemming is flawless, providing a straight-tone (no vibrato), eerie, airy sound in her performances to emphasize the other-worldly influence of this music.  One wonders how authentic her \\"elfin\\" would be, but since her vocals are nearly indistinguishable from the orchestra, the accent could hardly be determined anyhow.<br /><br />The End Of All Things is an amazing piece of compositing, and I've been listening to it over and over. As stated by other reviewers, I don't feel that Annie Lennox was the best choice for Into The West. Her voice is harsh and out of place next to the rest of the performance. However, this might have been intentional on the part of the composer, and I will attempt to understand, while taking a star from a perfect score!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|Fleet Foxes seemingly have come out of nowhere. In April, they released an interesting EP \\"Sun Giants\\" and a couple of months later they came out with their debut album that surpasses the EP by miles. If you are not familiar with the band's sound, the best way that I can summon it is early My Morning Jacket + Band of Horses = Fleet Foxes, as much as that is a generalization.<br /><br />\\"Fleet Foxes\\" 11 tracks; 39 min.) starts off \\"Sun It Rises\\", and the opening sounds of that track (church-like a-cappella singing) actually are somewhat misleading to what will come. Comparisons to early My Morning Jacket are inevitable on tracks like \\"Ragged Wood\\" and \\"Quiet Houses\\", and that's a compliment. There are several tracks that feature just main songwriter Robin Pecknold's voice and acoustic guitar, just beautiful, such as on \\"Tiger Mountain Pleasant Song\\". The album is sequenced perfectly, and it flies by in no time. Other highlights include \\"He Doesn't Know Why\\" (reminiscent of Band of Horses), a lush \\"Your Protector\\", and the album closer \\"Oliver James\\", again just Pecknold and his guitar, just mesmerizing.<br /><br />In all, this is clearly one of the best albums of the year for me so far. Haven't had a chance yet to see these guys live, but I sure hope I will soon. Finally, if you wonder where I found out about these guys, I heard them on the internet-only station WOXY (\\"Bam! The Future of Rock and Roll\\"), the best source for indie-rock in the country, bar none. Meanwhile, \\"Fleet Foxes\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" by Eckhart Tolle is a very, cool book.  I have found this book to be consciousness transforming, and that's the real beginning to transforming your life & ultimately the world.  This is very high energy, clear, deep, and useful material.      I like the way Tolle develops your understanding of 'ego.' With a more total understanding of ego based living you can begin to discover and practice some of the suggested ways to go beyond ego and into a more spiritually based lifestyle...by means of practicing humility, compassion, and gently bringing your awareness into the 'now.' In this way you can discover who you truly are and then awaken to you true life purpose.  As more and more people do so we begin to create a New Earth, through our shift in conscious & vibration.    An awesome & totally powerful book!    Even better read together with NEXUS, by Morrison & Singh, a spiritual novel about a heart-centered, transformative journey.

B00000IQW0|5.0|I received the movie quickly and in very good shape.  I would oder from them again.
0385340567|1.0|This is my first review I have ever written, and the only reason I am writing this review is that I feel that Child has done something that has me (and apparently a lot of other readers) feeling disgusted and betrayed.      Many reviewers state that they dislike \\"Nothing to Lose\\" because of it's political leanings.  I have read many novels with have political overtones, but they are more or less enjoyable.  The problem that I have with this novel, is that Child has corrupted the Jack Reacher most readers and fans know because of his political views.      **SPOILERS AHEAD**      My main problem is with Jack Reacher's support of people who desert the Armed Forces.  While I do not agree with Child's view on desertion, the true problem is that the view Child makes Reacher present on desertion corrupts his character and also logic.  Jack Reacher novels have strong overtones of Justice.  Letting the deserters go unreported was a true obstruction of justice, which then makes Reacher just as reprehensible as all the villians that he has faced. This corruption of a beloved character by the author would be akin to if Clive Cussler were make Dirk Pitt let an oil spill in the ocean go unreported and then attempt to justify it with extremely weak and illogical arguments (Which thankfully Cussler has not).  Reacher's stance on desertion is not properly justified in this novel, had there been a better argument and more logic behind his arguments then his character would have been more believable.  Child uses Reacher to say that a Marine's duty is first and foremost to his \\"unit\\", which it is not, and then he goes on to say that somehow not reporting the other deserting soldiers was upholding ones duty to his unit.  It is illogical because deserting during a war in the first place means betraying your unit there Ramierez would not be upholding his duty to his 'unit' because he did not bust the deserter smuggling ring.      **SPOLIERS END**    Because of the corruption of characterand the illogical arguments that Reacher is forced to use to defend his decisions, I would not recommend this novel to Jack Reacher fans or to new readers of the Jack Reacher series as the Jac Reacher in this novel is a different (or you could say corrupted) Jack Reacher than the one we all love.
0786838655|5.0|My son has the attention span of a gnat.  Nothing unusual, but it makes book choices hard, because he get's bored easily.    One advantage this series has over others is the Greco-Roman god tie-in.  My son likes mythology, and I figured he might be interested enough to stay with this book.    I was right.  He is ten years old and this series has had him reading all summer.  It is fun to watch him figuring out the background conspiracies, and plot twists that are at just the right level of complexity for a boy his age.  I have read the books as well, and they are very fun.  I especially like the underlying idea that those ADHD, dyslexic, hyperactive square pegs in society might just be something more.  I figure it resonates with his own knowledge of his hyperactivity.    I highly recommend this series.  It may be solely responsible for my boy catching the reading bug.

0792838068|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas is an Oscar winning movie that takes what should be repulsive material and spins it into gold. The story is about an alcoholic who goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death, and while there he forges a strong relationship with a prostitute. Nicolas Cage won the Oscar for this role, and he really deserved it. Sometimes he makes you laugh with his drunken antics, but often times you absolutely cringe. His drunken attempts at picking up women in bars are really pathetic. The woman reel away from the stench of his breath, and you can almost smell it yourself.<br /><br />Ben Sanderson: I don't know if my wife left me because of my drinking or I started drinking 'cause my wife left me.<br /><br />Elisabeth Shue also turns in the role of a lifetime. She has her own esteem issues, to be sure. At one point, she admits that she is only using him. Ben and Sera have an intense relationship where the only rules are, no matter what, Sera can't ask Ben to stop drinking. She knows he is trying to kill himself, but she has to accept that. She buys him clothes and lets him move in with her. She tries to feed him plain rice, but throughout the film, he never eats anything. Apparently a symptom of acute alcoholism, in the advance stages they can't keep any food down. When she prepares him plain rice, a bland dish that she hopes he can handle, he only eats an ice cube with his chopsticks.<br /><br />Sera: Don't you like me, Ben?<br />Ben Sanderson: Sera... what you don't understand is - no, see, no. You can never, never ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?<br />Sera: I do. I really do.<br /><br />Cage doesn't hold back one bit, and takes his character over the edge of the abyss. At one point he watches a stripper and chugs a pint of liquor. The raunchy jazz on the soundtrack seems to imply that he is playing a strange reverse solo on his bottle. The shock of so much alcohol to his system makes the sound drop away. He is in his own world, like a near death experience where he is crawling towards the light...<br /><br />Sera: How do you feel?<br />Ben Sanderson: Like the kling klang king of the rim ram room.<br /><br />Shue for some reason really impressed me the most when she was embarrassed and shamed by Ben's drunken antics. In one mishap he falls smack down on a glass table while lounging by a pool in a desert motel.<br /><br />Ben Sanderson: Look at me... I'm a prickly pear.<br /><br />When the innkeeper lady comes out to sweep up the glass she thinks she can charm her way out of it, but is told to go to her room, and in the morning, to check out and never return. Not quite as drunk as Ben, she is still capable of shame. She can also be hurt by him, as when she goes out working, and Ben gambles and takes a hooker back to her room. The look on her face when she returns is so poignant.<br /><br />Sera: What's up?<br />Ben Sanderson: I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you've a boyfriend, or a girlfriend, but I thought maybe we could get some dinner.<br /><br />You have two extremely powerful performances here, Cage and Shue, or rather Ben and Sera, are two messed up people, but this is also a tender love story. There is a lot of great jazz on the soundtrack, like for instance Sting does the ballads Angel Eyes and My One and Only Love. The former was a favorite of Ella Fitzgerald, while the latter was featured on the Coltrane and Johnny Hartman collaboration. The music is at times cheesy, but intentionally so. Perfect for the Las Vegas casino vibe. Other times sophisticated, funky, or even almost angelic in some of the later scenes of transcendence. Director Mike Figgis is a musician, and he also composed the score, as well as playing keyboards and trumpet on it. Not only that, he pulls a Hitchcock with a cameo, playing a mobster who passes Ben in the hallway, perhaps on his way to execute Sera's pimp. He is really a renaissance man, that Mike Figgis. In at least two scenes taxis are shown with an advertisement on the roof hoarding depicting a brand called \\"Red Mullet\\" - the name of director Mike Figgis's production company and it's his face in the ad.<br /><br />Sera: Is drinking a way of killing yourself?<br />Ben Sanderson: Or, is killing myself a way of drinking?<br /><br />John O'Brien, the writer, perhaps didn't actually do all the things that Ben, the character in his book did, but he did commit suicide about two weeks after the film began production. Director Mike Figgis contemplated abandoning the project, but decided the film would make a good memorial for O'Brien. Did he drink himself to death? Perhaps it is just morbid curiosity on my part, but apart from how much of John O'Brien may or may not be in his character Ben, it is a very compelling narrative. O'Brien's prose has been compared to Charles Bukowski or Larry Brown.<br /><br />Sera: That's nice talk, Ben - keep drinking. Between the 101-proof breath and the occasional bits of drool, some interesting words come out.<br /><br />I haven't read the book, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the book was much better than the film. However, the film was good enough to win several Oscars and nominations, in spite of the ugly subject matter. It told the story very well in cinematic terms. There are lots of beautiful shots; the neon lights of Vegas never looked prettier. There is a shot filmed underwater where Ben drinks from a bottle of beer even though he is submerged. The best shower scenes since Psycho, where Ben and Sera both are trying to cleanse themselves from some gut wrenching scene of defilement. Ben even showers with not one but two bottles of liquor.<br /><br />Sera: So why are you a drunk?<br />Ben Sanderson: Why am I a drunk? Is that really what you wanna ask me?<br />Sera: Yes.<br />Ben Sanderson: Well, then, this is our first date, or our last. Until now I wasn't sure it was either.<br /><br />Does it glorify alcoholism? I don't really think it does that at all. It is really horrendous and the downward spiral a pathetic tragedy. If anything is glorified, it is the spirit and love of the two main characters in spite of some serious character flaws.<br /><br />Ben Sanderson: I came here to drink myself to death.<br />Sera: How long will it take you?<br />Ben Sanderson: I'd say about three to four weeks.<br /><br />SELECTED FILMS AND ROLES OF NICOLAS CAGE<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000OVLBF8 Ghost Rider (Widescreen Edition)]] (2007) ....

My teenage son and his friends had just seen WALL-E and the face of the robot looked so much like \\"Johnny Five\\" that we wanted them to see Short Circuit. It was just as much fun as it was the year it was released. Definitely stood the test of time. A bunch of 16 & 17 year old enjoyed it just as much as we did.

Never since John Lennon have I felt such emotion listing to a song.  I mean ALL of his songs.  There isn't one song in which I haven't connected with and loved hearing over and over again.

1591391105|5.0|The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins is squarely aimed at the task of a manager coming in and dealing with a new team. Those first ninety days can really make or break a business relationship and it is well worth studying this information before you take on a new job.<br /><br />Michael breaks down your task into these discreet steps: promote yourself, accelerate your learning, match your strategy to your situation, get early wins, negotiate success, achieve an alignment, build your team, create coalitions, keep your balance and expedite everyone. Each step gets its own discussion so you get a handle on how to succeed in each area.<br /><br />New hires are often swamped with \\"learning things\\" - Michael helps you balance that learning with actually doing productive work. That way people feel energized by your being there and get a sense of your promise.<br /><br />Even if you're moving up in the same organization or taking on new responsibilities a lot of these issues are still important. You want to maintain solid boundaries - otherwise you'll get angry and resentful at people taking advantage of you. You want to admit errors quickly so you're not thought of as rigid and undependable. You want to proactively deal with problems instead of avoiding them, manage your stress so you don't burn out, and have a support system to keep you going.<br /><br />There are a few \\"real life\\" style examples in the book, but it primarily is laid out like a textbook to learn and study. While some might find this difficult to read, it is well worth treating a new job LIKE an important test you want to study for. You may not get a letter grade - but your job success is probably far more vital than any random chemistry exam ever was.<br /><br />Yes, some of this might seem like \\"common sense\\" - but after all, many bosses fail. They just don't understand all the aspects of their job. It is well worth reading through this even if you know 8 out of 10 things listed. Getting a good handle on the remaining two might be the difference between success and failure.the remaining two might be the difference between success and failure.
1582701709|1.0|I listened to this book at the behest of a friend who promised that my eyes would be opened to the secret of the universe.  Having tired of reading psycho-babble thirty years ago during my college days, I tried to respectfully decline, but gave in and bought the audio.  \\"The secret\\" is this: your vibes are magnetic and you will attract like minded mental magnets, and the riches of the universe will be yours.  Never mind that the basic premise defies the immutable laws of physics, i.e. in magnetism, opposites attract; the mindless blather never lets up for the full four and one half hours of the book.  This book is living proof that people with nothing to say never tire of saying it.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I'm a major fan of the Stargate series and have watched it since the night it originally aired 12ish years ago.  Having said that though, I can also tell a bad show from a good one - and, in my opinion, this was a very well done movie.  It does play like a longer episode, but that's what makes it work for me.  It plays like the shows I came to love and look forward to while the series was on the air and it has the added bonus of a larger budget which shows in the special effects and in the sets.      I highly recommend this for anyone that loves the series and the Stargate universe.
0143034901|5.0|I can't even begin to describe what a wonderful book this is.  It is definately top 5 for me.  The characters in this novel are rich in depth.  Emotionally and physically I had a vivid picture in my head about each and every one of them.  The pain of a father, a son, an author, a historian (book collector) as well as a lover.  Twists and turns pulling you in to every page.  Page after page of magnificant words put to paper to tell what I feel is the most gripping story I have read in a long time.  This book had no \\"drag\\" times for me.  It followed a smooth trail from start to finish.  Carlos Ruiz can write.  Read him!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is the best miniseries I've ever seen. An this is quite a remarkable achievement for a historically accurate work of non-fiction over the thousands of works of fiction out there. Just as a dramatic movie it's spellbinding. But when you consider it actually happened it's incredible.    I warn you, once you start it you will want to finish all three discs in one sitting.    As to the DVD set, the menus and special features don't disappoint. They are well and attractively made. The quality is excellent, and avoids useless and unrelated junk that clutters so many DVD special features with nonsense. The best feature is titled, \\"Facts Are Tricky Things\\". This turns on parchment like pop-ups (using the sub-title function of your DVD player,) as you watch the movies that fill in historical facts and common knowledge from that time that someone from this time wouldn't ordinarily know. The best example is at the beginning of the sixth episode when Thomas Jefferson uses a cliche that I have never understood before. The pop-up explained it's meaning concisely, and cleared it up for me. But watch it the first time without these and enjoy the drama.    Most importantly, I think this is the first portrayal of the Revolutionary period that doesn't paint the Founding Fathers, especially Washington, as larger than life for dramatic effect. The story is more compelling as it actually was without making men into Superman.    I'm a big history buff. And the Revolutionary period of the U.S. is my favorite. (I carry the Declaration of Independence, The Constitution and the Federalist Papers on both my laptop and iPod at all times.) And I couldn't find anything that contradicts the historical accounts I've read. While some portrayed scenes were not directly out of the historical record, (and they couldn't be as no one was following these people around with a camera back then,) they are in keeping with the diaries and letters I have read. While I haven't gone over the seven episodes with a fine tooth comb looking for mistakes like a Science-Fiction fan does with Stargate or Star Trek, I have found no historical errors at all.    More important, this is the most entertaining movie(s) I have seen in years. Hollywood's so-called Blockbusters aren't a tenth as good. Even people who profess to dislike History enjoy this DVD set. It goes to first place in my list of all time best movies ever.
0596007124|5.0|[Reviewed by XPSD member Ryan Shiffer]    My previous experience in studying design patterns has been met with failure. I have tried getting through the Gang of Four book on design patterns, but reading it for me was about the same as reading the dictionary. Reading this book made the experience of learning design patterns an enjoyable experience instead of a literary root canal. Head First Design Patterns takes the most useful (and understandable) design patterns and makes them accessible to the everyday programmer.    Each chapter tackles one or sometime two related design patterns and creates a rich example to explain it with. Some examples are a little contrived, but they do the job to explain the patterns with real code. Along with this are lots of discussions and other interesting exercises to hold your attention. These help to further explain the pattern, some of the pattern's pitfalls, and where and when it is appropriate to use the pattern.    Along with introducing design pattern, this book reinforces object-oriented design principles and best practices. This proved to be a useful addition to the design patterns and helps root them in the larger picture of object-oriented design. I found myself immediately applying these principles and design patterns in my coding and reviewing older code where I \\"thought\\" I was using design patterns correctly.
B000GLKLCK|5.0|I actually have two sets of the complete Mozart concertos with Murray Perahia,in addition to a number of individual performances by pianists such as Serkin, Barenboim, Rubinstein, Andsnes, Pollini, etc. etc.  The first set I acquired did not have the 2- and 3-piano concertos; the second, more recent set, does include them.  The combination of Perahia and Lupu is sublime - certainly two of the finest Mozart performers today.    In particular, Perahia's performance of the 9th, 15th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th are not to be outdone by anyone.  And the English Chamber Orchestra is probably the best chamber orchestra in the world today.

B000002H38|5.0|I remember listening to this cassette tape with my mother and two older sisters on our many long car rides 2 PA 2 visit my Grandma when I was young (like under 10 y/o) & I loved it then and I LOVE it now. Of course I couldn't grasp the concept of R&B, blues, jazz, or scatting but I knew it sounded good. I LOVE Anita her voice and just the relaxing sound of her music! It you don't have Rapture get it because it's a classic.

0061122416|5.0|A fable, a mystery, a hidden treasure...what is there to not like!? I actually listened to this on my way to and from picking berries (so far I have picked over 70 lbs., for our family and friends) I was immediately captivated by the tale of a boy, a Shepard who follows a dream of reached potential to a land faraway and unknown. He leaves what he does now, and what is comfortable to reach what may not even really be there. I cannot resist the talk of omens, and personal legends, and magical stones and dreams, and love which so saturates the pages of this short novel.<br /><br />Personally I enjoyed listening to it, it felt like an ancient tale told to me by a Egyptian storyteller. I felt the beauty of the language and the force of the legend.<br /><br />However if you are not into dreams, and somewhat mystical tales...sit this one out, because that is what it is. I wonder though, if those of you who are not would be won over by the smooth words of Coelho. It is always worth a try! I loved it, and completely recommend it :) I haven't ever read a Paulo Coelho book before, and now I am a Cohelo believer, I am interested in what other really good books he has written.
0761944524|5.0|This book is perfect!! Very informative, the layout is systematically and on top of it all; statistics becomes fun. It is a pleasure to read this book!!  Thanks to Andy Field which made my life as a PhD easier!!:O)
B000VI70WM|4.0|I honestly feel this is one of duran durans top 3 albums. Right up there with Rio & The Wedding Album.....  Astronaut was excellent as well. All 12 tracks on this disc are solid. Tons of harmony,solid beats & typical strong lyrics & melody from Le Bon. Wish there was a little more guitar on the disc although Falling Down has some nice guitar work on it. As far as pop albums go this is a top notch effort. Very worth yof 4 stars. My favorite tracks are The Valley, Tempted, Shes too much, & Dirty Great Monster.
B0011TQLA2|2.0|Yawn......  yeah sure it's them, it's Radiohead, but really, I was really hoping for a complete jump forward from the sounds of their last few years and do something that would really make us open our eyes, like they did when they made that massive jump from The Bends, to OK Computer, to Kid A, to Amnesiac.   It's well produced, has some good sounds, but it blends too much with the rest of it to make it not as distinct nor as interesting.

0143038419|1.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is an annoying person and spending time with her world view made my IQ drop.      Overall, she is trite, vain and self-centered.  The most pretentious part of the book was the visit to India when she found God-- her multi-cultural, hippy drippy God-- again and again. Right.      I wish I had not wasted my time on this drivel.
0767811070|4.0|i just recently watched this movie again for the first time in years and enjoyed it all over again.
B001AR4K8K|3.0|I have had the most difficult time in rating this release fairly. I live here in Santa Cruz County and this film is a time capsule for the area, but I was watching this to check the Blu transfer, which unfortunately was limited to original quality shortcomings.<br /><br />The special features are all similar to the 2-disc set, and the sound was not mixed to anything new (sounded worse in some parts). The positive though is the clarity improvements for the backgrounds and recognizing all the extras. I did the usual pause stops in about 30 places and nearly every frame looked average to poor (for Blu); the night shots were universally grainy and even had foreign material still grained in. BUT - one great exception was the helicopter shots - they must have used a different camera as each aerial Boardwalk shot is screen save quality. I paused just after the main title and was easily able to pick out everything you could not on the standard DVD. Was able to recognize several of the people on the roller coaster shots now when I could not on the DVD. So there are some nice improvements, but in being fair to all of the other BDs I have seen and what quality exists, this is not a mainstream purchase recommendation.<br /><br />It is almost mandatory ownership for the locals though. Once you see the deleted scenes and opening credits of the main docu, you can see the improvement over the original film stock. Between this and Sudden Impact, at least the aerial shots will always be preserved in how West Cliff and the coastline used to look.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|It's humans versus giant space bugs!  In the 23rd century, humans live on a crowded, militaristic Earth with fascist overtones.  Three friends from high school join the military and serve in a war against grotesque insect-like aliens.  We see war propaganda, training for war, sci-fi warfare (mostly not so different from current warfare), gung-ho attitudes set against the human (and bug) costs of war, and some romance.  The action is well done, with impressive special effects, the plot compelling enough, the cast good-looking, the mood ironic/tongue-in-cheek mixed with realistic/gritty violence, and there's more, though the value of the \\"more\\" is debatable.<br /><br />Director Paul Verhoeven had a serious purpose in mind, to show that \\"war makes fascists of us all,\\" and it's clear he is satirizing militarism.  But the film is such fun as a popcorn movie and sticks so close to a typical war movie plot, with a basically triumphant outcome, that the intended moral is undercut, or at least its cogency made less apparent.  There's much in the film to make us uncomfortable about war/militarism, but there's as much or more that invites us to merely enjoy it, cheer it on, or otherwise see it as attractive, it seems to me.  The lesson we can take from that is rather muddy.  Shows war propaganda works, I suppose, but doesn't show that's a bad thing.  (The \\"Put Yourself in the Film: Join the Fight!\\" feature described below seems to encourage us to participate in the war as fun.)<br /><br />Among those who wish to take the film seriously, it also suffers from comparisons to the Heinlein classic novel it was uncomfortably married to.  Verhoeven had limited interest in being true to the book, which he didn't even finish reading (though the screenwriter did).  It's probably best to approach the movie initially without much of the baggage that would come from either a serious purpose or the book, and then if you can get more out of it from those connections (as some do), all the better.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray edition will be released on August 5th.  It will carry over special features from previous releases and add a few new ones.  The new ones, exclusive to the Blu-ray release:<br /><br />-- \\"FedNet Mode,\\" described as \\"bonus view picture-in-picture with enhanced graphics,\\" includes pop-up video, text and graphics that go into more detail about the movie, characters and story<br />-- BD-Live feature \\"Put Yourself in the Film: Join the Fight!,\\" which allows you to insert yourself, or rather your uploaded image (internet connection to your player required), into some scenes from the movie<br />-- \\"Recruitment Test\\" trivia challenge<br />-- Blu Wizard, which allows easy, customizable access to features<br /><br />The features carried over from older releases:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Ed Neumeier<br />-- audio commentary by Verhoeven and stars Dina Meyer, Casper Van Dien and Neil Patrick Harris<br />-- \\"Death from Above\\" documentary about the movie and its production, including interviews about what the filmmakers intended and how it was received (30 minutes)<br />-- \\"The Making of Starship Troopers\\" (7 minutes)<br />-- \\"The Spaceships from Starship Troopers\\" (4 minutes)<br />-- Special Effects Comparisons: 8 sequences showing the raw footage with the final version superimposed in picture-in-picture format<br />-- Storyboard Comparisons: 3 sequences showing original storyboards with the final movie versions superimposed picture-in-picture<br />-- Bug test film (\\"Don't Look Now\\"), with introduction by Verhoeven<br />-- \\"Know Your Foe,\\" a five-part text and video clip featurette on each of the major types of bugs (Warrior, Tanker, Hopper, Plasma and Brain)<br />-- Scene Deconstructions: 2 scenes with commentary by Verhoeven<br />-- behind-the-scenes footage<br />-- 5 deleted scenes<br />-- screen tests<br /><br />There isn't any mention of the isolated score audio track with comments by composerBasil Poledouris that was included on the 2-disc standard DVD Special Edition.<br /><br />Video/sound: Amazon has waited so long to put up this page (July 31st) that I've already been looking over the early professional reviews to see about video and sound quality, so I'll pass along what I've found for anyone else interested.

0385486804|1.0|Wow, an anthem for idealistic, self-serving morons the world over. It's a shame people glorify this kind of weakness in a human being. The kid was obviously mentally ill. I'd recently bought the book but decided to go ahead and rent the movie. What a disappointment. Sean Penn tries much too hard to sell this poor, stupid kid as some kind of hero. Stop begging Sean.
B0015519VS|4.0|Okay, we get it. This album was not as good Confessions, but did you really expect it to be?  Confessions is one of the best R&B albums of our time. Besides, Usher has moved on from that. He's grown up quite a bit on this album. This album is made more for a candle-lit dinner than a night out at the club, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.    Favorite Tracks:     2. Love In This Club - Great club banger that went to #1 on the Top 100 chart. It also features a verse from rapper Young Jeezy.    5. Moving Mountains - An emotion-filled ballad currently making moves on the Hip-Hop/R&B charts, this song is a perfect example of the vocal improvement from Usher. It was produced and written by \\"Tricky\\" Stewart and The-Dream, the same duo that brought us Rihanna's \\"Umbrella.\\"    13. Appetite - Anyone that misses the Usher from Confessions, go to \\"Appetite.\\" This Danja-produced beat is about Usher resisting urges to cheat on his lady. I personally think this is the best on the album. The breakdown at the end of the song will hook you.    16. Love In This Club Part II - Great remix to a great song. I would say this is way better than the original. Great collboration between Usher and Beyonce. It also features a hot verse from scorching hot rapper Lil' Wayne.    Not as good as Confessions, but still well worth buying if you haven't already got it. Some other favorites of mine are \\"Something Special,\\" \\"Before I Met You,\\" and \\"Lifetime.\\" There are some good guest features and producers like Bryan-Michael Cox, Jay-Z, will.i.am, Jermaine Dupri, and Stargate among others. Try to zone out Confessions for this one, you might enjoy it.
B0010ZR160|3.0|I absolutely love Dennis Lehane and quite frankly this movie does not do the book justice.  Casey Affleck is no Patrick Kenzie.  Plus Gone, Baby Gone was like book 3 in a series.  I don't understand why he would do a film in a middle of a series.  Plus, I was stunned to see Angie just simply his girlfriend when in the books she's a married woman whom he wishes would leave her abusive husband.  Lehane books are so layered with emotional angst and is nowhere in the realm of being predictable.  This movie was transparent and very predictable.  And Bubba?  What a joke.  I urge everyone to please read the first book in the series: A Drink before the War-and I guarantee you'll be hooked.  This...wasn't horrible but it truly didn't do this series justice.  Patrick is a complicated guy and there's a reason why he knows a lot of criminals.  Same for Bubba-in this, you don't understand the connection between the two men.  I'm glad to see I'm not the only one that thought that Casey sounded like he had a mouth full of marbles.  Nepotism at it's best.  Still, it's an okay movie; Lehane needs to let the likes of Eastwood to continue to make his films.
0618918248|5.0|Anyone who picks up this book and seriously reads it in its entirety should not walk away the same person or at the very least would have to seriously question their faith.  Unfortunetely, those who really need to read this book won't because of childhood indoctrination of faith.  Those who think independently or think critically will appreciate it greatly.  It's amazing that this world has reached the 21st century and we are still holding on to bronze age biblical rantings that are beyond logic, reason, and critical thinking.  Thanks to Dawkins, he illuminates very eloquently the absurdity of religion, its dangers, and its stunting of critical thinking, science, and advancement of technology.  Anyone who still believes in this day of age the virgin birth, being raised from the dead, or the turning of water into wine might just as well believe that the earth is only 6 thousand years old and it's still flat.

I'm dying.<br />Is there anybody here, when it's over, over, I'm just passing the time.\\"<br />(It would be depressing if it wasn't so silly)<br /><br />Yeah, these are typical lyrics you'd expect from a side project from DM. Daron Malakian is usually known for writing clever lyrics, but no. It doesn't matter whether or not it's sung catchy in any way. Sure, Daron Malakian is a horrible singer, but his singing is nowhere near why the album sucks. It's the lyrics, the bland and uninspired musicianship, the simple melodies, etc.<br /><br />Granted, this album does have one song, that's decent. That would be They Say, which is pretty good. Buy that off iTunes and avoid the rest.
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on that aspect.  However, I didn't feel like I learned anything about humanity or the human condition from watching this movie. If you invest this much time in watching something, you hope to feel even just a little bit wiser when it's finished.  The characters acted predictably and stayed \\"true\\" to their stereo-typical character types.  No surprises.  The 2 stars are for the relatively good acting and for the directing.  Overall, though, watching it was a waste of time.

1591841992|4.0|If you don't have any idea of how pictures can help you see more dimensions of problems and explain your solutions better, this is a good book to get you started. The book's main drawback is that it doesn't discuss how to integrate stories with pictures to make for more compelling communications. You'll have to learn to do that by reading books about storytelling to supplement this one.<br /><br />I consider myself to be not very good at creating pictures for either solving problems or communicating solutions. I was disappointed that the book wasn't aimed more at helping people like me who understand the principles but have trouble applying those concepts.
0385340567|1.0|I don't want to repeat ad nauseum what has already been said in previous reviews, so I'll be brief. I am a Jack Reacher fan, at least I was until I reached the end of the latest Lee Child novel. There for all to read was our tough, sensible hero telling someone who essentially lost her husband in military action in Iraq that the act of desertion from the military was now fully justified because the war was NOT justified. In fact, Child tells us that the last war worth the blood and treasure we paid was World War II. His argument, as simplistic as it was, is an insult to the intelligence of all those who have served their country and risked their lives doing so in the last six decades. In a cheap manipulative twist, Child has the woman do a 360, from being angry with Reacher for his views on desertion, to admitting she had begged her husband before his tour in Irag to desert, but that he had refused. Despicable. By forcing his political views on us through Reacher, Child has done considerable damage to Reacher, the character, and has alienated a loyal fan. Even prior to the desertion rant, I was less than pleased with the book. The prose fell far short of the clean, spare style that graced previous Reacher novels. The plot meandered and turned back in on itself several times. Having reached the desertion dissertation at the end of the book, I figured out why. To force feed us his shallow political views, Child was compelled to make the plot more intricate than it needed to be. I will think twice before renewing my acquaintance with Jack Reacher.

B001C08RHA|5.0|A fantastic film. Possibly better than Spider-Man 3 was, but will never beat Transformers. I enjoyed the part where Stark as Iron Man blows up that tank. But I really liked it when Iron Man and the Iron Monger went to battle. I also thought that when Tony was testing the Mark II armor and crashed and was sprayed with a fire extinquisher that made me laugh. My favorite quote was \\"Shoot me again and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to community college\\". So see the movie and get the DVD.
0385340990|5.0|Initially I had difficulty engaging in this, an epistolary novel that takes place in the years following WW II. I had difficulty giving it a context. It begins at a place that feels like the middle of things (as if I missed something), but then eventually gathers the far-flung bits of fabric that make up a life and the texture of many lives.<br /><br />The story is like a tapestry; it starts with a solitary bit of material and then stitches together a saga of interweaving lives on the Channel Island of Geurnsey that took place during the 2nd World War.  I fell in love with the eccentric, rowdy, and often ribald cast of characters and my heart bled and broke more than a few times over the beautiful comedy that emerged from the tragedy of war.<br /><br />As I kept reading, the story strengthened and became deeper and thoroughly enfolded me in its tale of hope in a hopeless situation and endurance in an almost unendurable time of German occupation and starvation.  This is a story of courage and love in a time of moral ambiguity and ruthlessness.<br /><br />These rural characters are unsung heroes. I feel like I met each and every one of them personally and that they touched me in all the vital places where love resides. Additionally, it is a history lesson of a place that time and distance will now not forget.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|People need to realize that reviews are sometimes wrong. Sometimes something so new, so visionary, happens, that it just irks the reviewers. I don't know what it is, but \\"eye-ball lacerating\\"(NYT?) does not begin to describe the shock of visual freshness that is this movie. This is a totally reinvented color palette for a movie, it will leave you breathless. Yes it is heavily nostalgic, bit it's also very new. Yes the plot is simple, but in a way that's different from all those kid movies that are so flatulently tired of their own story-lines. Go speed racer, he always lands on top.

B0011N1WE8|4.0|Penelope is a modern-day fairytale involving a family curse: as revenge for an unjust death, a witch curses the Wilherns so that their first daughter will be born with the face of a pig. For several generations, only males are born, but when Penelope (Christina Ricci) comes along, the curse is fulfilled, and she's born with a pig's snout. Her parents (Catherine O'Hara from Beetlejuice and and Richard E. Grant channeling Christopher Walken) keep her locked away after faking her death so that the paparazzi will steer clear.<br /><br />Now in her mid-twenties, the sheltered Penelope has several talents, including botany, chess, and music (and Penelope's vintage glam costumes are to die for). She's a voracious reader as well, with a library full of rare, valuable first editions. Every week, her overbearing mother makes her meet several potential suitors (bluebloods) in an attempt to break the curse: in order for that to happen, Penelope must be loved by \\"one of her own kind.\\" Most jump out the second-story window in horror when they see Penelope face-to-face, describing her as a gruesome monster (in all fairness, the pig makeup is underwhelming; I saw her face and went, \\"that's it?!?\\"). The butler's job is to catch the escaping suitors to prevent them from blabbing to the press, but one particularly loathsome character, Edward Vanderman the Third (Simon Woods), escapes and sensationalizes Penelope into a drooling, savage monster with razor-sharp fangs; the story is printed on the front page of local newspapers, complete with caricature straight out of the Exorcist.<br /><br />At the same time, down-and-out gambler Max (James McAvoy, [[ASIN:B00005JNV9 Rory O'Shea Was Here]], [[ASIN:B000ZIZ0RA Becoming Jane]] and [[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)]]) accepts $5,000 for secretly snapping photos of Penelope, and pretends to be genuinely interested in her brains, not her looks. Predictably, the two feel a genuine attraction before long, but Max's secret as a spy is discovered, and he's banished from the house. The rest of the film focuses on Penelope's escape and quest for independence.<br /><br />Quirky, with loveable characters and some not-so-loveable ones rounding out the cast, Penelope feels like a lost Tim Burton film; the zany dialogue reminded me of Beetlejuice at points, as did the dark, twisted visuals. The message of \\"love who you are, not what you look like\\" is beat over your head about a million times, and Catherine O'Hara as the stage mom is particularly loathsome as she obsesses over plastic surgery for Penelope and other ways to make her daughter \\"normal.\\" But I found Penelope to be an engaging fairytale, if a little long, in large part due to the sparkling performances of Ricci and McAvoy.<br /><br />On a final note, it appears that Penelope has been edited from the theatrical version, with several scenes shortened and some swearing removed. Also, according to posters at IMDB, the music has also been redone. This is a shame, and in large part it's due to some confused marketing; although this would appear to be a children's fairy tale, it's largely adult (Penelope becomes drunk, steals her mother's credit card, etc., there's a blatant sexual reference from Reese Witherspoon's character), and should never have been marketed primarily as addressed towards children. Hopefully, the original theatrical version will be released at some point. Extras include an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Twilight (a new scene, some behind-the-scenes footage, and brief interviews with director Catherine Hardwicke, author Stephenie Meyer, and several of the stars).spy is discovered, and he's banished from the house.

0760783748|5.0|I first heard of the book through the movie, and thought I would see where the movie originated from! This a great book and unlike the animated film offers a more expanded unicorn fantasy adventure that offers the reader so much more backstory on the characters, which I really really loved! Though the animated movie was fantastic and I will cherish it forever, the book offers up some great story telling that invokes very vivid images of the Last Unicorn and her quest.    It also has a great sequel in the back to compliment the original story!    I recommend this book for anyone who loves unicorns!
1881273156|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It helps to know how my children feel loved. I have a child that feels love by receiving words of affirmation and another that feels love by physical touch. I especially liked the chapter about discipline. I don't think parents discipline enough and when they do, they do it wrong according to this book. There is a way to discipline while still showing love to your kids. It is our responsibility to discipline our children if we want them to grow up and be responsible adults. If we don't discipline them, we are only hurting them in the long run.

0061537934|5.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" was stacked on the shelf at the coffee shop for its book club. The title intrigued me but the photo of the Yellow Lab is what clinched it. The book arrived from Amazon around noon one day and by 6:30 that evening, I had finished it. Three days later, I still couldn't talk about the book without tearing up. This is not a bad thing.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've been so moved by fiction, and it's difficult to remember while reading that this IS indeed fiction and not a real memoir written by a real dog.<br /><br />Enzo the dog wants to be a man. He feels he will make a \\"good man\\" because he is a good listener, among the many qualities he brings to the table. He is wise in the most practical and simple ways and has learned much about life from watching racing videos on the Speed Channel. His owner, Denny, whom Enzo loves and respects, is an up and coming race car driver. Over the course of the story, the family of Denny and Enzo grows to include Eve and then Zoe, the child of Denny and Eve.<br /><br />You need not be a dog lover to appreciate this marvelous book, but if you are, the book will move you like nothing written before. The prose is lovely, the images perfection and the wisdom light-handed and sprinkled throughout. I rarely mark up my books, but I couldn't resist underlining many of the passages in this one.<br /><br />\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" will take you by the hand on page one and by page two, have you by the throat. You won't be able to put it down. I am only sorry it didn't go on for another hundred pages. I wept (I'm a sucker for dog stories), and I laughed myself silly. I was deliciously worn out when I finished this one.<br /><br />This book is a joy. Garth Stein has given us a lovely literary gift that is sure to become a classic.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061537934 The Art of Racing in the Rain]]

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Plenty of reviews on this site testify to the marvelous quality of this film, and its extraordinary performances. And there is no doubt that the film is a pure delight to watch.  What I want to point out is that this is an excellent film for young writers and artists, as it is the story of how a young woman with considerable talent fights for recognition and finally receives it.  Her story is exceptional, but then again it is not, because writers and artists do achieve success all the time.  However the struggles of the beginning artist are considerable, and the need for faith throughout one's career never ends.  I heartily recommend this film to anyone who wants to write, to paint, to dance, to sing, to do anything creative, and especially to those who are up against opposition from family and friends. .  You will find the film  comforting and affirming.  And as others have indicated here, its an extraordinarily fine and wondrously enjoyable  film.
B0019IB26I|5.0|This album should be pure pleasure for anybody who appreciates a variety of blazing guitar and vocal skill.

1400079594|4.0|This book and its twists and turns is a great light read. The adventures of Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves are always enjoyable but this is one of the best.

B00005Q4CS|2.0|I give this film high marks for its editing and ability to hold true to its gut-wrenching focus from beginning to end. It's hard film to watch...but it also lacks much of a reason to.    The story, if you want to call it that, starts and finishes at the same point. There is no beginning, middle or end...it's just a sequence (though a terrifying one at that).    For a film to take itself as seriously as this one does, a viewer should...no wait, NEEDS to care about the characters. For me, at no point did I feel much sympathy or care about any of them, with the exception of maybe the mother.    Despite my frustrations with the script, it is well acted. It's gritty and certainly conveys the despair and dark underworld of addiction. But again, without any sort of arc, I never felt sucked into it and was really expecting some sort of payoff, which never occurred.    The editing is certainly unique and worth showing to film students. I've never seen a film like it from that standpoint.    If you can ignore the writing and just \\"go along for the ride\\", then its worth a watch. Personally, I was hoping for more.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|Hellboy II:  The Golden Army is the sequel to the 2004 film [[ASIN:B00008EY65 Hellboy]] and based on the [[ASIN:1593070942 comic book creation]] of Mark Mignola.  Guillermo Del Toro ([[ASIN:B000WSLAUO Pan's Labyrinth]], [[ASIN:B000274TLW The Devil's Backbone]]) returns as the director despite the film being distributed by a completely different company.  Good for Del Toro, he really wanted to make this movie and up until I actually saw the film I'm not sure I understood why.  Del Toro really is becoming a real standout as a filmmaker of late and for me part of the reason is because he doesn't really care what he makes.  Unlike a lot of good directors, Del Toro isn't putting together a film to please his critics, but instead to please a wide audience.  He must also get some pleasure out it himself, because it really seems like this is just a guy who loves to make movies.<br /><br />Hellboy II provides a little more background for our demonic hero and then gets right into the film's plot and lots of action.  Basically, a long time ago this kingdom of elves and such raised the Golden Army to destroy humans but the battle was so one-sided that the elven (or is it elfvish?) king wanted the Golden Army stopped for a bit.  In the present time, the prince of the elves, Nuada (a fantastic villain played by Luke Gross) wants to raise the army again.  In order to do so he needs to put together the king's crown in order to control the army.  The crown is in several pieces.  Nuada is portrayed with more dimensions than your typical fantasy villain.  He kind of reminded me of Magneto from the [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men movies]] in the sense that he was a villain with a really solid explanation that you could almost sympathize with.  His sister, Nuala (played by Anna Walton) is sort of caught in the middle.  Hellboy and his co-workers at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) are called upon to investigate some things that leads to them crossing paths with Nuada's plan.<br /><br />Doug Jones is back as Abe Sapien and several other incredible creations that harness Del Toro's special effects team and give us a glimpse of what we are in for when Del Toro brings the Hobbit to the big screen.  Selma Blair returns as Liz Sherman, Hellboy's girlfriend with pyrokinetic powers.  Ron Perlman of course is back as Hellboy and we get a pleasant surprise in the comic relief character with depth named Johann Krauss, voiced by [[ASIN:B000083C6V Family Guy]] creator Seth MacFarlane.  The characters are many so they never wear out their welcome, but Del Toro is careful to maintain individual depth to almost all of them.  Hellboy is still the richest character in the story and Perlman tops his charm from the first film here.<br /><br />Del Toro really shows us a unique world with tremendous possibilities for many more exciting sequels.  He has an amazing imagination that he communicates well to one of the most talented filmmaking squads around.  It is almost a shame that Del Toro and company's voyage to Middle-earth will delay another sequel (perhaps with Dark Horse character Lobster Johnson?).  I wish there more guys like this around to keep making these fun and visually stunning movies.Doug Jones is back as Abe Sapien and several other incredible creations that harness Del Toro's special effects team and give us a glimpse of what we are in for when Del Toro brings the Hobbit to the big screen.

B00011RPB0|5.0|Lost in Translation is all-too-often misunderstood. That couldn't be any more evident with its 500+ \\"1/5\\" votes, which is certainly ludicrous, inaccurate and unfair. I understand it may not appeal to everyone, but it's flat out ignorant to deem this as a poor effort or production. It's anything but.     Is it perfect? Of course not. But it wholly fulfills what it sets out to do and is a fantastic effort from Ms. Coppola.    People may complain that the storyline or plot of this film is thin, but its simplicity is part of its charm. The aesthetics of this film alone make it worth seeing. If you never had an inkling to go to Japan, this film may change that. Coppola's vision of Tokyo and in essence, her \\"strangers in a strange land\\" angle, is strong and prevalent from beginning to end.    Bill Murray's performance is outstanding, as well as refreshing. His dry wit and comedy sense permeates throughout much of the film. Scarlett Johansson is also convincing and well portrayed.    The cinematography is amazing, and for me, very much part of the film's appeal. I was also thrilled with the ending. Overall, I just enjoyed WATCHING this film. A must see for any fan of Murray or Johansson, as well as those drawn to films centering around human relationship dynamics.    I found myself relating to the film's characters on multiple levels and therein lies its strength - capturing the truest thoughts and questions of people as they move through life, but never tries too hard or reaches in order to drive a point home. It never goes over the top for the sake of mindless entertainment.     It's an introspective piece and rife with super dry comedy.

B00005JO20|3.0|I'm a big fan of the original King Kong, but I never go into re-makes expecting it to compare to the originals, for better or worse.    The bottom line for me is that this film was too long (for no reason) and had too many sequences that defied physics and plausibility to the point of diminishing an otherwise visually stunning adventure film. More is rarely truly more.    Many of the action sequences reminded me of how someone who lived it would TELL the story, not how it actually happened (exaggeration for effect):    Specifically, the idea of Kong Repeatedly falling down cliffs, fighting off T-Rex's, etc. all the while holding an unscathed Ann in one-hand seems a bit absurd. If it happened for only a moment, it might have some punch (like a close call.) But instead is happens for several minutes, yet she is never harmed, no backlash, nothing. Imagine getting into a car crash for 2-3 minutes and escaping unharmed. That's the same physics for these scenes.    Another scene features the crew trying to escape a stampede of Brontosaurus', but the scene is so jam-packed with the creatures in such a small space, it looks more cartoon-ish than believable.    Another incredulous scene features a young man who the filmmakers go out of their way to tell you has no experience with guns. Later, in the heat of battling giant inspects and larvae, he loads a Tommy gun and shoots giant crickets off his comrade, some 6-10 feet away. Not once does he ever hit his friend. Even in the hands of the most trained marksman this scene is a stretch beyond stretches.    When Kong escapes into the streets of New York, all is pure chaos and non-stop madness. But the second he finds Ann (or rather, she finds him), the streets are suddenly dead quiet with no sign of destruction. Huh? I also had a very hard time believing that the crew could effortlessly track Kong on such a vast, incredibly dangerous-terrain island.    There are many other scenes that defy logic and physics that really took awayfrom them, when they should have been highlights of the film.    As far as the length of the film - there were many scenes and sub-stories that seemed completely unnecessary or were totally unfulfilled. The story between Mr. Hayes and Jimmy escapes me entirely. It was interesting until one of them is killed, the other one cries and then you never see or hear of either again. Yet, we've spent approx. 10-20 minutes focused solely on them and their history. Why? It takes literally an hour to REACH the island. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, we finally reach New York. Don't get me wrong, once the action starts, it's pretty relentless. But you can't tell me in a story as simple as King Kong that there's any reason not to get this film down to closer to 2 hours, instead of breaking the 3-hour mark. I think I would be more forgiving if we were left with any sort of solace or payoff at the end, but it ends rather flatly (no pun intended.) I realize it's a re-make, but if Jackson is going to take liberties to build up characters and make us sit through 3-hours, there better well be a good reason. I never found one.    Despite all the above mentioned, there were many aspects I did like. The realism of Kong having true gorilla mannerisms was great and it really lends to the viewer's sympathy for him as a wild animal, simply following trying to his instincts. For that same reason, I found the ending to be gut-wrenching, as well as his captivity scene. The action and visual effects are stunning and once they start, they don't let up. I really felt like I had been somewhere extraordinary when it was over.    I thought all of it was very well acted, but unfortunately, there wasn't much of a reason to be. It's all action and the only emotion most people will feel is between Ann and Kong. I felt very little nothing for Ann and Jack's romance, which is too bad.    In the end, I would recommend this film as a visual stunner and to true fans of King Kong, or fans of fast-paced action and adventure films (after the first hour, anyway.) If you've never seen the original, or aren't interested in the concept, there should be no problem in skipping it.    Lastly, I would NOT recommend it for kids. It has some scary moments and the theme is too mature for most kids to understand anyway.
B00000J631|5.0|This compilation is probably one of the best I've ever heard. Sure, not every song on here is great, or even \\"good,\\" but the idea of putting together such a collection is brilliant. Many of the songs rank among my top 5 favorite songs by their respective artists. Short and sweet! As for the songs that aren't that great, they're over so fast you don't have time to go completely insane listening to them.<br /><br />A lot of reviews I've seen say it's a great way to see which bands you may want to look into further. For many of the songs, I'd say that's fine, but there are also a lot where the bands took the arguably silly idea of a huge collection of 30 second songs and were silly with it or did something completely different than their normal style. This is fine in my opinion, as it creates a great diversity in the style of music, but be warned if you're using this as a sampler to introduce yourself to new bands.<br /><br />I fully recommend this comp.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|God, this KILLS me as a lifelong Indy fan, but what must be done must be done...    An excerpt from my review on Pirates: Dead Man's Chest applies flawlessly here:    \\"It suffers from all the pitfalls you fear going into a sequel...bloated budget, very little growth from the main characters, overly-complicated plot, countless unnecessary scenes of which very few carry any sort of punch, etc.\\"    It's clear from the outset that Lucas and Spielberg were zeroed in on the punchy, pulp fiction action that Indy was first conceived, vs. catering to a more modern, movie-going audience. If you go into it expecting a freshly scripted, character-enriching experience, you'll likely be disappointed. If you're looking for a nostalgic popcorn-popper, chances are you'll be satisfied.    Many will cry foul over the film's plot being related to aliens. That was the center of pulp fiction in the 50s and clearly that was important to the writers here. I can't argue with the creators in terms of their subject matter, but I will say this: the alien theme, while I understand its origins in the mind of the filmmakers, was a big and VERY NEEDLESS jump in the genre. It reminded me of what a new writer does to a previously existing successful series in any medium, such as a TV show, or comic book. They've got hundreds, if not thousands, of mythologies to choose from and they settle on...campy, American pop culture? A really risky premise and unfortunately, a theme that Lucas insisted on. But hey! It's Lucas' baby, we need to accept the premise to move on, which bring me to frankly, the biggest and most glaring problem....the STORY/SCRIPT/PLOT.    Detailed points:    1. The entire Area 51 sequence: TOTALLY UNNECESSARY. The story could easily have started from the university. Mutt could have been introduced with a lot more care and in such a way I cared when it happened. We could have learned a LOT more about their chemistry and relationship instead of wasting time at Area 51. The same goes forthe nuclear testing scene - 100% UN-NEEDED.    2. CARTOONISH VILLAIN and SUPPORTING CHARACTERS - Spalko, played by the very talented and capable Cate Blanchett, is easily the weakest villain in any IJ film to date, being outmatched by not only predecessors, but previous SUB-villains. Case in point - I was more loathsome of the antics of the Nazi general from Crusades, or the slimy Toht of Raiders than Spalko. We never see her worst deeds. Why should we hate her? I knew why I wanted to see previous villains fail, but not so here. More squandered talent in Jonh Hurt and Ray Winstone - their characters were also two-dimensional and forgettable. Again, these issues are a symptom of a bad script.    3. TONS OF PLOT EXPOSITION USING DIALOGUE instead of imagery, actions or scenes. Are you kidding me? This is SPIELBERG. This is LUCAS. And yet they STILL fall into this amateur trap that's preached in Film-making 101? This was the majority of my problem following the details of the story, because it was fed to me through laborious blocks of dialogue. I honestly can't recall how scenes were linked together...there's no \\"dots\\" for me to follow having just watched it.    4. ASPECTS OF LOVE. Maybe it's just me, but the way that Marion was re-introduced and the whole \\"family\\" dynamic were really flat. Marion seemed more like a token shoe-in than the fiery character we knew and grew to love in Raiders. Another NEEDLESS character. This only made the wedding scene a bigger question mark and awkward. There was NO buildup to that outcome and frankly, the idea of getting married doesn't fir either character AT ALL. They make better adventure buddies that have spurs of passion for one another, but know it would never work between them. THAT is the Indiana and Marion we know and love.... pragmatic and stubborn. No where to be found here.    5. FLAT ENDING. By the end of this film, I need to understand INDIANA JONES better. Just like I did at the end of Temple of Doom. Just like I did atthe end of Last Crusade. But here? I knew nothing more about him. No new leaf turned. Just kind of going through the motions of what the filmmakers THINK we need to see of him. And even in THAT respect, the scripts fails - little use of the whip, a pistol or even most glaring yet....    His WITS! Pay attention....this film included NO part of Indy using his ingenuity or outwitting the bad guys when his back was against the wall. I found myself out-thinking the film. That should never happen.    Then there's all the more petty complaints that people have that many I agree with, but were not the most damaging, such as the nuclear testing sequence, the Tarzan and Brando homages, etc. These were somewhat tacky elements, but FORGIVABLE if the story/plot/script is any good at all, which unfortunately and almost inconceivably, is not true here.    I think the reality is, this is a franchise that is not meant for modern thinking movie goers. The suspension of disbelief is harder to come by. That isn't to take anything away from Indiana Jones, it's just a simple observation that timing is almost just as critical as subject matter in the formula for success. But it's also glaringly apparent that Lucas is totally out of touch with movie goers and his audience. I really wish that when he considered reviving the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, he realized that such beloved treasures as those had NOTHING to gain, yet EVERYTHING to lose. Crystal Skull is, unfortunately, another unnecessary black mark on Lucas' legacy, not unlike Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones.    Despite my disappointment and long-winded criticisms, many will enjoy this film for what it is. Still, one can't help but be befuddled that after 19 years, this is best the Lucas and Spielberg could come up with.

0307346617|2.0|Ther are too many problems with World War Z for me to reccommend it to any but the most rabid zombie fans. There is no character development as each chapter is a story unto itself and that means there is no hero to root for. Any sense of drama stemming from anxiety about the outcome of the war is destroyed by the premise because its written after the war has been (sorta) won. Also, its meant to be a government report but the introductions at the beginning of each chapter are filled with melodramatic descriptions that belie anytype of objectivity. There are incongruities as well, which is a deal breaker in my book. For example, one moment a man puts his bloodied knuckles in a pool of zombie goo and lives to tell his tale, then in the very next chapter people are afraid to shoot zombies point blank because if the blood touches an open wound they will be infected. Last, each chapter has a different narrator and they come from communities as diverse as China, Tibet, Russia, etc., yet they all sound exactly the same with the exception of a foriegn word or phrase thrown in. Perhaps the worst  issues for me are the lionizing of South Africa's apartheid masterminds and turning Isreal into a perfect, peaceful community that welcomes Palestinians and refugees back into its loving borders! That is really a stretch! All in all, a cool premise with poor execution and way too much hype.
075640407X|5.0|This book is spectacular - plain and simple. It's dialouge is believeable, it's characters are real and the language is beautiful. It has been a long time since I've felt my heartstrings played with such dexterity.    I read this book in three days and was so invigorated by it's quality I immediately lent it to a good friend. Afterwards I tried reading another fantasy book, but found it paled in comparison to this one. Later that day I went out and bought a second copy so I could read it again!     Game of Thrones used to be my favourite book; but The Name of the Wind blew it out of the water. I highly recommend it.

0316010669|5.0|Blink by Malcolm Gladwell is subtitled The Power of Thinking Without Thinking.  Because that pretty much summarizes my life, I decided to read it even though it's an \\"intellectual\\" book and I usually steer away from too much heavy reading.  I'm glad I made an exception.    Blink had my attention from the beginning.  Gladwell has assembled interesting vignettes from normal worldly life and used them to illustrate his point about the value and dangers of making snap judgments.  He doesn't advise us to discard all cognitive reasoning or experience as background for coming to a decision, but he points to many past decisions that could have been better if reams of information, scientific facts, and expert opinions had been ignored.  Thin slices of experience, as opposed to lengthy studies or long periods of familiarization, often produce more satisfying and productive decisions.    Gladwell presents many examples of better decisions through snap judgments.  A quick analysis of couples by observers produced a higher accuracy rating in the chances of their marriages making it as opposed to lengthy studies of their compatibility, small talk patterns, and body language. A singer's music CD inadvertently fell into the hands of the co-president of a large record company who loved it and passed it around.  The singer's success was almost immediate because he was thin-sliced by top executives who knew and liked good music and knew how to promote it.  But then market research firms published opinions by mainstream listeners from around the country who found him lacking and unlikely to find a core audience or to gain significant radio air-play.  People who had never seen him, and only listened to a couple of his songs, completely stalled his career.    Large symphony orchestras, traditionally mostly male, have improved their performance by hiring females who audition from behind screens, masking their sex.  Innovative military commanders who rely on experience and seat-of-the-pants decisions have regularly trounced better prepared forces with superior equipment and manpower.      Gladwell points out that all is not good with this technique if some fundamental safeguards are not applied.  Four police officers in the dark entrance of a Bronx tenement pumped 41 shots into a scared and unarmed Guinea immigrant.  When heart rates go up, cognitive reasoning goes down, according to Gladwell.  Only seven seconds passed from the time the officers first saw the victim, called out to him, thought they saw a gun, pulled their guns and fired 41 shots into him.  Quick decisions were made with fatal results. Mind-reading abilities were probably impaired by elevated heart rates causing a series of misjudgments to be made.    I highly recommend this book for a look into the world of decisions.  We have to make them every day and we have to live with those made by others.  Gladwell presents a well-researched study that is fascinating.

0385340567|1.0|Like what others have said, I am a huge Lee Child fan. I have always loved the writing syle; the plot development. But I found myself angry while reading Nothing to Lose -- some of the scenes were poorly written, unbelieveable and sophomoric. And I almost put the book down when Mr. Child introduced his political views. While I hope Mr. Child can return to his former exciting writing style, I shall read the Amazon customer reviews before making the purchase.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Definitely one of the great music movies of recent memory. While the music is heartbreaking the story is one of hope and possibility. A beautifully told story that features an incredible chemistry between the two lead actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B0013DDNKC|5.0|I remember buying this when it was first released on vinyl.  I wore this sucker out.  Randy was simply the best. Rippin' chops but with an amazing melodic sensability. An amazing talent as this album demonstrates. If you are unfamiliar with Randy, BUY THIS!!!
B00009Z576|5.0|A lot of Yes fans won't even give this album a chance due to the fact that vocalist Jon Anderson is not on it.  In my opinion this is a big mistake.  Anderson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman both departed the band after the \\"Tormato\\" album and tour (Wakeman for the second time).  The rest of the band, drummer Alan White, guitarist Steve Howe, and bassist Chris Squire decided to continue and added vocalist Trevor Horn and keys player Geoff Downs to the lineup.  Horn and Downs had been formerly known The Buggles, a new wave group that had a big hit with the song \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\".  When I first heard that these two guys had been picked to join Yes my first thought was \\"you've got to be kidding me\\", but amazingly this lineup put out some really killer music.  \\"Drama\\" is unlike any Yes album before or since, but it stands on it's own as a great mix of progressive rock, AOR, and 80's style new wave.  Chris Squire and Alan White really step up to the plate on this one like they had something to prove.  Squire is all over the album playing his bass like a man possessed, sharing in many of the lead vocals, and involved in much of the songwriting.  Alan White is all over the drum kit playing with a much heavier rock style than on previous discs.  Even Steve How adapts his guitar style to fit this new sounding approach, and it works like a charm.  Horn does not sound like Jon Anderson on vocals, but he has a similar high pitched voice that really harmonizes with Chris Squire's similar vox in a nice way.  Geoff Downs is a great keyboard player (along with Steve Howe he would go on to form Asia after this album) and adds just enough of a new wave feel to Yes more prog oriented sound.  Of the songs \\"Machine Messiah\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" rank right up with the band's all time best.  The other tracks are all solid as well.  If you are a Yes fan and have never given \\"Drama\\" a chance you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.  I think I like it even more today than when it came out 28 years ago (wow has it really been that long?)
0393061310|5.0|Diamond initiates the book with a simple but valid and very interesting question of why the current power distribution in the world is as it is as opposed to some other way. He takes us thru from the point where everything was equal - at least it appeared to be so - to where we are now and attempts to explain the way things progressed as they did and how different parts of the world advanced as opposed to others; not only how this took place but also why it did not take place in other parts of the world too.     Going thru the arguments are really enjoyable, un-put-downable and teaching. It can be used as a great teaching material and that was the reason I have ordered a new copy for my son who is 14 for him to learn, question and understand intricacies of these social and technological developments as well as appreciate the value and capability of all societies.     Diamond concludes every chapter as well as exploring in detail in the last chapter the importance of consequential circumstances in these events. This makes us more knowledgeable in relation to where we are as societies and allows us to understand that this is not only result of the intelligence of races but also environmental consequences. This is an important message that needs to be expanded all around the world, specially in the west and lately in the far-east that we should look at our successes with more humility and stop acting as if such successes are only attributable to our own race and/or being the chosen one.     I endorse this view and therefore I recommend this book to everyone who wants a better understanding of the history of these developments in our world.
0307269191|5.0|I first heard of Haruki Murakami by looking up the Amazon running book stats. Since I check these often it wasn't the ranking that got my attention but the title. I was intrigued. The title: It's too long by modern standards, and it speaks to deep thought as well as another culture. I ordered the book and anticipated its arrival.<br /><br />To my surprise,  it wasn't the running that stood out. In fact, I found the running sections ordinary. Now, understand that I am a runner, and have read about running day-in and day-out for the last 13 or so years. I know triathletes, ultra runners, and people who thrive on doing the extreme. So running with goals, sticking with it, running on a daily basis, marathons, triathlons, never walking- always running, are ideas that I hear and see everywhere. To a non-runner, Haruki will seem like a star, but to me, it's fairly ordinary, even with Haruki still having these goals in his 50s.<br /><br />What did intrigue me (besides the title) was his style of writing. It's a simple book, very clear, and easy to comprehend, so what clues are there in the book to his style, the style that has made him a famed writer? This is what I wanted to discover. Surely not the repetition of \\"I'm the kind of person who...,\\" to explain This is who I am. This is my way. This is me.<br /><br />After a few chapters, I started the book over and read each sentence carefully to see what I could discover. And here are a few samples, quotes so to speak, that make Haruki's writing special.<br /><br />\\"As if the concept of clouds doesn't even exist.\\" - Haruki's way of describing a sunny day.<br /><br />\\"...as if it remembered, 'Oh, I've got some errands to do,' it whisked itself away without so much as a glance back.\\" - Description of a rain shower.<br /><br />\\"...slicing through the air like they had robbers on their heels.\\" - Sprinters<br /><br />\\"...pound the rock with a chisel and dig deep into the hole...\\" Finding his creativity.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED FOR<br />- Anyone who likes to read about running.<br />- A new marathoner looking for inspiration for reaching goals and sticking with running.<br />- Writers who want to look closely at style and sentence structure.<br />_ People who enjoy biographies.<br /><br />A BIT MORE - Other things that made the purchase of this book of value to me:<br />I enjoyed the little things Haruki would talk about when he wasn't running in a \\"cozy homemade void\\" - the Italian lady who wore a different outfit every day, his loss of patience with everything in sight at the end of his first marathon (a reverse running of a famous course in Marathon, Greece.)<br /><br />So running log aside, this was a book that caught my interest, and intrigued me enough to want to read more by this author. I'm starting at the beginning and am going to read the first book that Haruki wrote as a novelist, Wild Sheep Chase. I'll go into this blind.

0765342294|1.0|I wrote \\"possibly\\" because I'm only 2/3 of the way through.  The only reason I continue to read it is because I keep thinking, \\"Surely, based on over 2,000 5-star reviews, something MUST happen to pull this book's fat out of the fire soon.\\"  The plot is thin, the characters are cardboard, the dialog would be laughable if it weren't so terrible that even laughing at it gives it too much credit, and I don't know what drove Card to have the 6-year-old boys running around naked half the time, talking about kissing each other's butts and how many pubic hairs they have between them, but he may be eligible for sex-offender registration based soley on this book.  I've read there's a scene coming up where a bunch of naked little boys beat another naked little boy to death in the shower.  Is this a work of science fiction or a description of a pedophilic snuff film?  Also, Ender's genius is constantly hyped, but it seems like he's only a \\"genius\\" because every other member of the military is borderline retarded.  \\"Hey, guys, in zero gravity, the terms 'up' and 'down' are relative!  I'm Isaac freakin' Newton!\\"  Seriously?  No one in the long history of space travel had figured that out before Ender?  Seriously?      Sheesh, this thing better have a good payoff, or I'm putting it in a paper bag full of dog feces and leaving it flaming on Card's doorstep.
B00000IL67|5.0|this collection contains both old n modern releases.  i've been a mild fan o alice cooper since the late 90's n have no regrets o ever purchasin his tracks.  my personal fave is the 4th disc with rockin tracks like the man behind the mask, feed my frankenstein, teenage frankenstein n more hot picks.  i would highly recommend this material for all the hair metal rockin fans out there.
B000244EMO|4.0|This is probably my favorite, over-the-top, action movie.  It has likable characters, memorably cheesy quotes (i.e., \\"I ain't got time to bleed\\"), and a high body count.  This movie is alot of fun.  As one reviewer described it: \\"superior mindless trash.\\"
B0018GRAE4|5.0|THIS BAND IS AWESOME! The combination of angry vocals and clean vocals makes this band appealing to many people who otherwise don't like the Metal genre. Even their \\"ballads\\" (The Bleeding, Never Enough), make you want to bang your head until it bleeds.<br /><br />If you haven't checked this album out yet...you definitely don't know what you are missing.
B000MCIBE8|3.0|When I went to the music store and bought this cd, i was excited to hear the sound that everybody was in love with for 40 years. I threw it in my cd player and liked it but thought it sounded a little poppy and not really like the other psychedelic rock bands i had heard. As always i opened up the cd case and pulled out the artwork and the first words i read were \\"This is not the cd that has been around for 40 years.\\" I kinda freaked out because automatically i labeled the cd i had just bought as junk. So I read a little bit more and realized that this is how the doors were \\"Supposed to sound.\\" I mean it did sound alright, but if everyone fell in love with a different sound, maybe its not how \\"the doors\\" were supposed to sound. Being that it was my first doors cd i went online and listened to the original and noticed it sounded alot more soulful and psychedelic. I mean why would you remix something that was a masterpiece. It may have been to make money, who knows.    Mainly i believe that the people who remixed the doors' wonderful debut album should have at least put something on the cover of the album that stated that this was just a remix, not the original. next time i buy a doors cd ill be sure to inspect it carefully before i make the purchase.

B0013FXWU6|4.0|Very dark, but poignant story of a crazed oil man who has a passion for money and little use for people.  I kept hoping for an enlightening moment in this dark character, but his humanity just continues to seep out of his soul like the oil than runs from the ground, and he continues to make deep wounds in the earth...and himself. There appears to be no cure for the main character (played by Daniel Day Lewis), his heart just grows harder and more destructive.  Opportunities for redemption and love are right in front of him, but he turns a blind eye. The story is rich in emotion and the acting riveting, but there is no happy ending.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B00005JL2O|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedy movies ! All the trillogy are so good!
B000URDEB0|5.0|To listen to each of Nightwish's albums in sequential album is to notice a band that manages to grow heavier more and epic with each album, finally ending in \\"Once\\" where the album wouldn't have been out of place in movies like \\"Lord of the Rings\\". \\"Once\\" was of course the last album before the band had a \\"falling out\\" with Tarja, their lead singer. While the band never truly went into much detail, it is my suspicion that as the band grew with each album, Tarja became more and more displeased with the direction the band was heading. I suspect that this album is what Nightwish would've sounded like (minus the vocals- obviously) had Tarja not any say in the band's music. That's just my observation, and maybe its completely wrong.    Dark Passion Play is certainly an epic metal masterpiece with heavy guitars, melodic keyboards, choruses, multiple vocalists, and everything in between. After listening to the opener \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" you will have a good idea of what is in store for you in the rest of the album. One would also notice that the new vocalist, Anette, isn't quite the powerful vocal goddess that Tarja was...but her voice fits the music. Perfectly. Don't get me wrong, she is still an amazing singer, but not in the same operatic style as Tarja. The 2nd song is pointed squarely at the previous vocalist...and it's a very heavy song with some rather angry choruses. Hmm. Next up track 3 is probably the best example so far of how Anette's vocals are so....catchy. They mesh with the music so well! And track 5 is Nightwish's heaviest song to date. The chorus is EPIC and so very addictive too. Just on the laurels of the band's heaviest song yet comes the obligatory ballad! This was the single that the band released prior the release of the album in an effort to try to show that Anette was indeed a worthy successor to Tarj. Those are big shoes to fill, and the song probably turned many fans off to the album. Personally, I find it a very beautiful song, and manygrogtard Tarja nay-sayers condemnded the album on this song alone. The album continues its flawless streak of divine songs all the way until another ballad-esque song at track 10. Ballad may not be entirely appropriate though. Annette isn't heard as much on this track, but that's okay! Here the Nightwish bassist takes the work-load here, and helms a song with some very strong Irish influences. The Irish influence continues into track 11; which is quite possibly my favorite song on the album. It is an instrumental full of violins and bag-pipes playing alongside the signature epic Nightwish sound. Track 12 is the last heavy song on the album, and its a duzy. It has an epic, addictive chorus...but by this point in the album that's nothing new. There is an interesting breakdown later in the song that is a continuation of the first track. The album ends in a semi-heavy-but-still epic ballad that again flaunts Anette's skills...almost to reassure us that Nightwish is here to stay, with or without Tarja.    To sum up this album in one word would be cruel, but if anything, it would be EPIC. Nightwish may not be very well known in America, but americans typically have crappy taste in music anyways. There's a reason Nightwish is probably the biggest metal band in the world right now. If you haven't heard of these guys, you need to. Now.
0316287059|5.0|The book is really great, I bought this book for my sister and they love it !!
B0010X745K|1.0|I haven't read the book so I don't know who to blame, but this just didn't work on any level. The plot had great potential: a window to an alternate universe opened by a military experiment gone bad, and the residents of a small town caught in the vortex. Sadly, instead of exploring the virtually unlimited possibilities for frightenting and enlightening circumstances, the story immediately bogs down into a hysterical drama.    What little shock the movie attempted to deliver was diminished by the apathy I felt for the cast of cliched characters (apocalyptic religous zealots, bumbling redneck locals, and of course the evil military). Even the ending of this movie, which I will admit was somewhat shocking, just did not ring true. Ultimately the mist was necessary as a plot device to obscure a really poor and underdeveloped story.
B000002LNC|5.0|I think this is one of the best compilations !!!!  I love ALL the songs !

Of course, I adored Enzo and his master, Dennis, who was a kind man.....I laughed, I cried...and I shared this book with my husband who also loved the writing style of Garth Stein.

B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again. I loved [[ASIN:B00004Z459 Hybrid Theory]], but this is probably my favorite CD that Linkin Park has produced to date. Everything is done better. There are more tracks, more songs, and broader emotional appeal.    Obviously hits like \\"Somewhere I belong\\" and \\"Lying away from you\\" are awesome. Other songs like \\"Nobody's Listening\\" are great as well. The songs combine metal, rap, and electronica extremely well. If you are a fan of any of those genres then this CD is for you. The songs appeal to your emotions. Whether you are feeling like an outsider or feel you have mistrusted, this CD has tons of songs for you.    I will say that I hated the song \\"Breaking the Habit\\". Many people enjoy the song, but I just do not. All the other songs on this CD are great to listen to though. Pick this one up as soon as possible.
B0012Q732O|4.0|This movie was O.K! I expected a bit more, as, far as the creatures from this era, but, the movie was O.K.!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Though I love many of the BBC products, Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South a top 2 favorite of anything I've viewed.     The characters are so well portrayed.  They brought you to believe in their causes, even on opposing sides of the issues,  and you could tangibly feel their emotions in various scenes.       The three lead characters, John Thornton, Nicholas Higgins and Margaret Hale were strong in their ideals and communicated these    effectively. Yet very interestingly, in their personal relationships, specifically the proposal scene, John Thornton and Margaret Hale are   communicating on seemingly different 'frequencies' and misinterpreting each others words at every statement. You literally feel the frustration of their conversation.   You can however, understand their previous communications and feelings lend themselves to these statement misinterpretations.       One reason I was so drawn to this story were the high ideals and morality of  Thornton and Higgins to do 'the right thing' regarding workers/co-workers and to be men of their word with great integrity.  The  great mutual respect they end up having for one another is so well deserved and fits with their character portrayals.  Their integrity and morality makes them two of my favorite characters of all time and one reason N&S is in my top 2 pick.       Margaret also has ideal of trying to do 'what is right', yet her character at times seems to hold on to a bit of a grudge.  She also seems 'sleepy'/dullish in faculties at times(very limited though).       As for feeling the emotion, (SPOILER ALERT) Margaret's departure scene from Thornton's mill - you feel it inside!  Also as she says goodbye to the Higgins'. Other spots, when Thornton finally gets she has a brother in Spain- you go \\"YEAAAAH\\".  And there are others.       When I got this dvd, I literally watched it 4 times in 1 week.    There are so many nuances and fine points to the characters and scenes, as well as the repeated yellow roses which I only noticed in half the spots till about the third time.          This story comes more alive each time I watch.  I wont easily tire of it if ever.  Hope if you get it you enjoy it as well.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Note:  This review contains spoilers; please do not read if you do not wish to find out important plot points before viewing the film.    This movie has so much---stunning scenery, a great cast, tight writing, economic plot, and haunting music---and it takes its time to unfold its tale of stark vengeance and redemption. This is unmistakably and indelibly a Sergio Leone vision. One could imagine that Clint Eastwood was first offered the role of Harmonica, the avenger, and then it went to Charles Bronson. However it worked out, Bronson was superb as the Everyman hero/possible avenging angel character; he projected a subtle sorrow in his piercing eyes, even his body language, that made him perfect for the role.    The plot is multilayered, revolving around a lovely widow (Claudia Cardinale) of a shrewd man named Brett McBain, who is brutally murdered along with his children by the railroad's hired guns while she is enroute to join them at their home in Sweetwater. Her property is what is coveted and it becomes Harmonica's bait to settle an old score with the chief hired gun, Frank, who is shockingly revealed to be played by wholesome Henry Fonda. His clear blue eyes, so apparently innocent-looking, become frightening in their lack of human emotions. Frank kills without remorse whatever it befalls him to kill as casually as flicking a leaf off his sleeve. Human life is meaningless to him, even more so than to his tubercular cancer-ridden boss Morton. At least he has a motive (greed) to explain his hubris; Frank evidently needs no such excuse and kills because it's what he was born to do.    Another character is brought into the tense mix, a bountied outlaw named Cheyenne, appealingly played by Jason Robards. He is also a killer, but one with a sense of humor and a kind streak, as well as a soft spot in his heart for pretty women. When both he and Harmonica are hired by Jill McBain to get revenge on her husband's killers, they form a strange alliance against Frank and the railroad, which Cheyenne sees as a threat to his way of outlaw life. Over time, he becomes friendly with the widow Jill, who in turn is oddly drawn to Harmonica. When Cheyenne realizes this, he utters his famous line: \\"There's something inside a man like that... something about death.\\" Everything hinges on McBain's property, which is substantial, and his plans to build a railroad station. He had everything legally in place to build the station but if it isn't finished by the time the railroad reaches Sweetwater, his heir forfeits the right to build it and even to keep the land. Harmonica uncovers the motive for McBain's murder and will prevent his dream from failing.    Frank, who is usually so icily carefree about death and those who stalk him, grows more obsessed with finding out who Harmonica is, since every time he asks him, the enigmatic drifter keeps answering by naming off men that Frank has killed. Everything comes apart for Morton and Frank as the killer begins to slowly but relentlessly unravel, with vague flashbacks rising as to who Harmonica might be. These, however, keep his past shrouded sufficiently so that Frank cannot quite close this maddening chapter in his life by just gunning down Harmonica and being done with him.    At last, Frank is mortally wounded in the climatic gun duel by Harmonica, who strangely is less fazed by what should also be a mortal wound, leading to the speculation that Harmonica is someone other than who he appears to be. Placing his harmonica to Frank's dying lips where his weakening breath wheezes out a few ragged discordant notes, Harmonica watches as his motive is finally realized by Frank. He had sadistically stood a man upon his younger brother's shoulders with a noose around his victim's neck, then shoved a harmonica into the boy's lips. Easing back to watch for the moment when the younger man's legs would finally give out and his brother would hang, Frank is smiling with cold pleasure at his handiwork. It is at thatpoint that the older brother cursed his killer and kicked the boy out from under him, thus alleviating the responsibility placed on Harmonica to keep him alive.    But this sequence, though gratifying from a vengeance point, does not answer the question about Harmonica's mysterious knowledge about Frank's victims or his apparent ability to shake off a serious wound with little effect. That combined with Harmonica's penchant to be in the right place at the right time, to stand outside of events while at times controlling them, gives his character a dimension that disconnects him from temporal events. He becomes at those moments like a mysterious angel of death.    Every actor was wonderful in his role, from Claudia Cardinale to Jason Robards, but the two principals were outstanding. Fonda, renowned for playing good guys, turned his reputation as an actor completely around with his flawless portrayal of the vicious and heartless killer, Frank. His foil, played to understated perfection by Charles Bronson, was the reluctant vigilante, the man consumed with revenge for his brother's murder, and yet not merely that. Bronson projected from Harmonica a deep and inexplicable sadness that permeated his words, appearance and actions.    This was not Leone's choice for a movie. He had abandoned the spaghetti Western concept after the Clint Eastwood films, but was persuaded to take on this project. It did not fare well at the box office, which is no surprise considering its length of almost three hours. A great pity, as it is sometimes overlooked by fans of the spaghetti Western genre for both its lack of commercial success, and for committing the unforgivable sin of not having Eastwood in the lead. It is a great film and works on many levels; in some ways, it is the distillation and the perfection of the SW genre even as it closed it out for good.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I love this movie the only problem was I received it and it was defective it skipped never played and I contacted the company I bought it from and They never contacted me back it took forever to get my refund! Note to others buy anything off of Amazon get it straight from them never buy from an unknown company don't buy from The Good Company they have bad customer service and as far as I'm concerned are real con artist I don't trust them so take my word for it!:)
B00005JPY0|1.0|This film was a great disappointment. Flat, two dimensional characters handled with little to no uniqueness. The characters relationships were unbelievable and frankly the audience couldn't have cared less for any of them. There was no chemistry between any of the actors. The plot was almost non existent.  I was unimpressed with the directing efforts. I found the entire film stilted and predictable and far too long. I found the film forced. Conversations were stilted, scenes choppy, cuts jerky even the sets/lighting looked like the stages it was.     Although, I am saddened to hear that Heath Ledger passed away, I was extremely unimpressed with this role. I don't believe it was his acting (which was heavily influenced by Jack Nicholson--close your eyes and Listen you'll hear it) but lack of opportunity in the script.     Usually, I gauge the successfulness of a film by the audience as it leaves. Applause at the end of the movie and the \\"wow the BEST part of a film was...\\" chatter as folks filter out. What we got at the end of this film was zero applause and silence. As they left, they talked about what movie they are really looking forward to.     The one thing to note is that this film does not deserve the PG-13 rating. It should have be R. Or maybe it should have been rated PG-16.
B000YD7S2Q|2.0|I had seen a scene from the second act on YouTube and was stunned at how beautiful and realistic the production was, so I purchased this dvd.  There were some amazingly beautiful touches in this production.  Sets, costumes, colors.  Also, some very fine performances by Studer and Schnaut most notably.      I was enjoying this UNTIL the very ending, which nearly, for me discredits the entire production.  The ending of Lohengrin is unique in that we have both overwhelming happiness and sadness.  When I say \\"overwhelming\\" - when done right, it is.  And as it IS so unique, the effect on the viewer is too.  Overwhelming happiness at the return of Elsa's brother and the triumph of \\"good over evil\\" - and overwhelming sadness as Elsa, upon discovering Lohengrin's departure, falling \\"life-less.\\"  (One small mystery that I have debated is whether Elsa merely faints or dies.)  In any case, Ortrud is basically \\"evil incarnate\\" as she, with selfish and malicious motives is the cause of every problem in the story.  HOW COULD the director obscure the very essense of the story at the end of this production?  In this production after Lohengrin's departure, Elsa and Ortrud are seen \\"reaching out\\" to each other.  huh??  HUH????  I was VERY disappointed, after having enjoyed the performance up to this point to witness such strangeness.  The effect Wagner surely wanted is NOT here.      I would urge everyone who likes this opera to see the Met's production with Eva Marton and Peter Hoffman.  THERE IS NO COMPARISON.  I can tell you that you will be \\"overwhelmed\\" by how powerful the ending SHOULD be.  Directors who distort the stories of operas are MISREPRESENTING great art.  This is a RAMPANT problem in the world of opera.  While on the sympohony orchestra stage, intellects are striving for authenticity, in the world of opera, great artists are participating in FALSE representations of some of the greatest works of art ever.  One would not tolerate a mustache on the Mona Lisa.  Opera lovers should INSIST on authenticity and respect to at least the ESSENSE of the operas themselves.
B000002VRZ|4.0|I just realized the Outlaws' version of \\"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\\" on this cd is missing the last verse of the original song.  I do not know if this is just their version of this song or if the Outlaws ever recorded a version with all the orginal verses?  The last verse of the original song (from 1949) is:    The cowpokes loped on past him and  He heard one call his name,  If you want to save your soul from hell  A-riding on our range,  Then, cowboy, change your ways today,  Or with us you will ride,  A-trying to catch the devil's herd  Across these endless skies.    Does anyone know?
B000SM7QUC|5.0|It looks like Jedd there completely missed the mark on what this CD is about, I don't want to be insulting so I'll just say this. The reason it doesn't sound like a Motley Crue album is because it isn't! This is not a Nikki Sixx solo project but rather a group project that includes DJ Ashba and James Michael, (who by the way has an incredible voice!) All 3 contributed to the writing and composition of the incredible tracks that you just need to hear for yourself. The songs are wonderfully inspired by Nikki Sixx's book, The Heroin Diaries which is why they are \\"diaristic\\". I think it was an ingenious idea to link a soundtrack to a book, which I have never seen before. It has the feel of a rock opera and gives breath to the words you are reading in a whole new way! Hearing Nikki speak some of the very words he wrote in the book also brings alive all the emotions  he experienced from depression and despair to joy at finding life. It truly deserves a Grammy! Sixx AM has created a new trend that I hope catches on, soundtracks to books. What a way to boost the reading experience!
B0019IB26I|5.0|John Mayer is not one to disappoint with his live performances. I became a fan after watching him on \\"Austin City Limits\\" and this CD is a great example of why he deserves the kudos he's received over the years.
0743486285|5.0|Yeah, Nikki had resources as rocker that most addicts don't have. At the heart of it all, he was still a drug addict. Here you have the rare opportunity to get into the mind of an addict in the middle of his worst period. On top of revealing his actual diary entries and his own reflections, he has the people that had to deal with him day in and day out honestly tell what he was like,(which by the way was a complete a**hole.)How many people actually want to know that about themselves?    At the root, you get an understanding of how childhood pain that is not dealt with early on can affect someone later on as an adult. Inside the rude and aggressive rocker was a child crying out, \\"I'm hurt and I'm lost\\". It also shows how undiagnosed depression contributed to his seeking to be self medicated.     This book is not for the faint of heart. It is explicit in detail on drug use and the lifestyle it created combined with excess. There are entries that would turn your stomach and disgust even the most tolerant of body functions. It does not paint a pretty picture of drug use, but then, would you want it to?     I recommend that parents, teachers, counselors, or anyone who works with kids read this book. Even as explicit as it is, I recommend teenagers read this book together with their parents or other trusted adults. It will raise questions, and open up a discussion.    Be sure to get The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack by Sixx AM to go with the book. It breathes life into the words you read in a whole new way.

B000YEUUCK|5.0|In selecting music blu-ray disc, audio quality is one of the most important criteria. This is one of the disc where the Dolby True HD quality comes out best.
B001ACY8D2|4.0|I see that the 5 star reviews get the most \\"helpful\\" votes. Well guys, I hope you won't penalize me for a slightly less lofty view of the newest sonic blast from Sigur Ros. But this does not measure up, in my opinion. I liked, but did not love Gobbledigook, which was bit meandering and unmusical. (If this is what pop music sounds like today, I really am getting old.) Though the percussionist is an astounding talent, (whom I would list by name if I could, but the dopey lettering on the inside of the CD prevents me from reading it) these pounding repetitive drums just didn't work for me. Not bad....but not great. However, the next track moves to the glorious heights they've frequently achieved before. Inn&iacute; m&eacute;r syngur vitleysingur has the dense polyphony and lush keyboards that I like, and they create something new, rather than something that sounds like a recycled track from &Aacute;gætis Byrjun, which is a 6 star CD, and still, to my mind, their most complete release. There is a diaphanous buoyancy, a joy, a feeling of some glorious and delicate balance that they build here, and wow, does it work. This may be my second favorite track ever, after \\"Olsen olsen.\\"<br /><br />So, that tells you bit about where I'm coming from. There's a bit too much precious and self-conscious noodling around, a little too much cute and dawdling fiddle-faddle. Where it works, it works gloriously. Vid spilum endalaust is another delight. But there is more dead wood, or at least decayed wood, than usual.<br /><br />Not sorry I bought it, not at all. Will provide much pleasure. And at a good price. But just a step down from the heights they've reached before. First purchase? Try &Aacute;gætis Byrjun. Back for a second helping? Then load it up and enjoy!
B00005UW9T|4.0|Movie is appropriate for all ages.  Good story with good animation.    Enjoy!
B00127RAJY|4.0|My review is based on 2 parts of this DVD    1) The workout in this DVD is really good. I like the mix of cardio, weights and abs in a short period of time. I am not new to working out but the level 1 had me sore a couple of days after I did it. Now, I'm in week 3 and I've noticed a difference in my endurance and strength. I don't do this workout everyday, I rotate it with elliptical and walking 3 miles.  2) I don't like the commentary or Jillian Michael's voice. By the third use, I was lowering the volume on my TV because her voice is grating and her comments are strange - she calls her trainers \\"buddy\\" and says things like \\" I could always use a  in my life\\" as she does the excerise with you. It just comes off as corny. Today, I turned the TV volume down completely and turned on the XM radio in my house and listened to that instead of her voice.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|My daughter LOVES!!! this movie. She watches it everyday (literally) and know just about every word by heart. She even know the bonus features and deleted scenes by heart. Great movie. I would recommend it to anyone!
B0017MO10U|1.0|I was let down by this movie, I've read the other reviews and I can understand how people are excited by seeing their favorite characters back again, but personally I think they are over-rating this film and not being critical enough.  Don't get me wrong, its ok but that's about it, it would have made a good two part episode but not a great movie.  The problem here is they are adding a little extra for effects or going on location and just selling episodes as movies at $16 to $20.  So what were my problems:    Length - this was too short for what they wanted to accomplish.  They could have added an hour to this and really added to the plot.  If I'm going to buy episodes of Stargate, I at least want to feel like I'm getting enough for my dollar.    Subplot - The subplots were stupid, Mitchell's grandfather just so happens to be the captain of the ship carrying the stargate in 1939.   Yeah that's believable, your audience isn't stupid and that subplot added nothing to the overall film, it was a complete distraction.  Oh, and of the entire Armed Forces to just happen to be at the North Pole training - It's Jack O'Neill, yeah ok again your audience is stupid and you're the smartest script writers in the world.  Give me a break.    From TV to Movie -  I sense a lot of the problems with this film, and potentially future films is going to be coming from an overly excited crew that are getting to do more making a movie than they did making a TV episode.  They seem to be more concerned with their locations and adding cursing to the script then they do about the quality of the plot and script writing as well as directing the acting.  The whole \\"we filmed it in the artic\\" means nothing, you get one scene of Sam and Mitchell walking across the tundra and some aerial shots, big deal nothing makes up for a good plot or at least spend more on the special effects.  This is even becoming a formula for the Stargate movies, let's pick a cool location, and then have one or two of the character just walk while we fly around filming them and we can add an orchestra piece and that's really going to impress the audience, or are we impressing ourselves while making the film.  The problem is they are impressing themselves not the audience, it just slows down the film for the audience and the film is already too short for that, spend the time with plot development not impressing yourself with the location.  They think if they can impress us with their cute stuff, but nothing, nothing can replace a well thought out script and thoughtful dialog.  **spoiler** There are two examples of this that drove me crazy, one was when Jack is killed by Baal, don't you think after 8 seasons of building up the Carter/Jack relationship she might start crying or freaking out and then when Daniel falls through the ice is frost-bitten and they have to leave him behind to die, don't you think that might call for an emotional moment or some great final words before you leave a beloved member of the team to his death.  No we only get Daniel saying, \\"Bye,\\" that's it...great script writing, well thought out.  This is why this movie needed to be longer, this why they shouldn't focus so much on location and cute curse words, so you could fully develop the plot and script.    Richard Dean Anderson - OK most of us thought he was going to be a major part of the story, hello, why wouldn't you make him a bigger part of the story; he was the bedrock of the series.  Instead we get a couple of unremarkable cameo appearances, with goofy dialog and no substance.  That was a let down, especially since you advertised him so heavily as being in the film.     Effects - I really was expecting more effects then what we got.  I thought there was going to be a great battle scene in space or cities getting blown up, but not really.   It was a big let down for a short movie without much action, just the film makers trying to impress us with location, or planes and subs, etc.  It wasn't great.    I'mgetting ripped off - Bottom-line, I love SG-1, I've seen every episode, but I really want thee show back... I'm not going to keep running out to buy these extremely short films.  It's a marketing scheme.  I'm sure they are making a lot more selling these DVDs then producing the show.  I'm done buying the films.  They just aren't worth it.  Put the show back on the air or why don't the \\"movie makers\\" just make a sci-fi stargate mini-series at least you would have time to fully develop the plot.  Anything is better than making your fans buy these films, or make better planned out films.

B001AIRUOU|3.0|OK...my husband and I love this movie, as well as most of Tim Burton's work.  We were amazed when we saw the 3-D version in the theater.  I of course will buy this set when it is released in a few weeks to go with my 1993 version I already own, but what I would really like to see is a release of the movie in 3-D format with a few pairs of glasses included (spykids). I'm sure there are plenty of fanatics out there that wouldn't mind paying the extra cost for it.  I know I'd pay.  I guess since it's a different kind of 3-D technology it may be harder to put into DVD format, but I will keep my fingers crossed.
B000000OQY|4.0|If Appetite For Destruction told the story of who Guns N' Roses were, GN'R Lies was the band telling the world who they were NOT. That is to say, they were not just another one-dimensional hard rock band. GN'R Lies shows the band's flexibility as musicians and pays homage to their influences.     Though this album is an EP and was put out as a, say, pre-dinner snack while the band worked on their next full length(s), one should not be quick to judge the album as simply a \\"collection of odds and ends and tracks that didn't make their previous album.\\" One of the greatest parts about GN'R Lies is how well thought out it was. The band were out to show that they could sell with a half acoustic album featuring only 2 songs that could have fit in next to the songs of Appetite For Destruction. A bold move indeed. It is important to note that this is a concept album. First off, the cover shows a tabloid-esque review of the band. It was during the period after their debut album \\"took off\\" until this point (and beyond), that Guns N' Roses was caught up in the whirlwind of media attacks and scrutiny: much of which the band claimed were \\"lies\\" - hence the name of the album. But not so fast, the album name isn't merely to tell the world that the band feel misrepresented; there is more to the name. The album itself is lies. That is the concept - it's Guns N' Roses pulling a fast one on everyone. The \\"Live ?!*@ Like A Suicide\\" songs are not live. It's a lie, but a clever one, since upon further investigation, the name actually suggests they are NOT live... that they are \\"as live as a suicide.\\" Next, the choices of songs like Reckless Life and Nice Boys start off the album and make you think it's going to be Appetite For Destruction II. Then they roll in the horn section in the jam-esque Move To The City, followed shortly by 4 all acoustic tracks: complete with whistling and lyrics like \\"shed a tear cause I'm missing you.\\" No, not the Guns N' Roses we all expected. Mix in a song that required a disclaimer from Axl that it was a joke (Used To Love Her) and a track that was essentially a bull's eye on the band's back for the media (One In A Million), and you've got a nice group of lies about Axl and band-mates being murderers, racists and homophobic -- all of which would be denied by the band... repeatedly.     And through all of this superficial deception, when we scratch a bit deeper, we find that lyrically, this is the band at it's most honest and introspective with lines like, \\"It's been such a long time since I've known right from wrong.\\" To draw another comparison to their first album, Appetite For Destruction was a youthful cry out of the band's identity, no apologies, while GN'R Lies showed the band coming to fully understand their \\"reckless lives\\" and coming to terms with all that it entailed.     The story of Guns N' Roses cannot be told, nor fully appreciated without this album to bridge the no-holds-barred rock of Appetite For Destruction with the sprawling even poignant artistry of the Use Your Illusion albums. One could only wish for a few more tracks to turn the album from a \\"middle finger to the critics and dissenters\\" to a big  \\"?!*@ you\\" to anyone who would question the greatness of the band.

B0013L2EDQ|1.0|Wow!  As someone who's previously enjoyed Rollins' Sigma series, I was shocked by how painfully scattershot this installment was.  Too long, too repetitive, with characters more wooden than an oak tree...the list goes on and on.     Even by the lighweight standards of the pop kitsch beach novels that fill airport book racks, this one's a stinker.
0312360266|5.0|Great book.  I will definitely order the rest in the series.  Thank you.
0393312836|4.0|This book is very good.  It hass undertones as to the situations that are presented in society now even though it was written so long ago.  The disregard of youth for the laws that are put in place to protect them and ourselves leads to their inability to function in society and their eventual decomposition to vagrants that put weight on the already weighted prison system.  Upon finding a seemingly just punishment and solution the spin doctors find a way not only to persecute the \\"afflicted\\" youth but also use it to defeat their own enemies.  Very good book however the slang that he was praised for using and developing was very difficult to get into.  It actually made me not want to read it at first but getting into it and eventually learning it allowed me to really enjoy the read.
0143038419|4.0|I just finished Eat, Pray, Love last night, after a friend gave me the book months ago, it took me a passport to get through India.  Loved Italy, and Indonesia.  I found Ms. Gilbert's work to be witty, clever, and attentive to detail.  I could visualize each character in her book, as well as each circumstance.  The journey taken with Ms. Gilbert was a fantastic one, filled with laughter and tears.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  A great read, just need a little patience in India, after all meditation is the focus there, and God knows, we all need patience for that.  Just wanted to say thanks for making me laugh, and feel inspired and brave.
B0000024JN|5.0|When examining the over-the-top gangsta posturing of mainstream hip-hop in the past 15 years, it's easy to see why some cats neglect to pay homage to one of the golden age's finest. This album single-handedly popularized hip-hop in all aspects of mainstream music, as it was the first #1 album in hip-hop history. Rick Rubin's uncanny mix of old school party beats over highly memorable rock samples is one of the most copied formulas in hip-hop history. It stands as some of Rubin's most memorable and excellent production ever. The production isn't the only reason this album was as wildly successful as it was. King Ad-Rock, MCA, and Mike D were three of the most relatable emcee's in history. They were a tight-knit crew of white party-loving fratboy-type dudes that appealed to the white suburbanite crowd on a grand scale - boosting their success to unrivaled numbers.<br /><br />Every cut on this 1986-classic is fire - forget about skip material. I remember listening the opening cut, \\"Rhymin & Stealin\\", for the first time ever, and being blown away by the Sabbath, Zeppelin & Clash samples. It seemed revolutionary from the get-go. My two favorites were always the Trouble Funk-inflicted \\"The New Style\\" & ridiculous stylings of \\"Posse in Effect\\". The undisputed classic singles are \\"Fight for Your Right\\" (who doesn't remember this video!), \\"Paul Revere\\", \\"Brass Monkey\\" & \\"Hold It Now, Hit It\\". Even the non-singles, such as \\"No Sleep till Brooklyn\\" & the goofy \\"Girls\\" were classic tracks, and the mashed-up samples in \\"Time to Get Ill\\" were phenomenal.<br /><br />Overall, if you're taking a pass on the Beastie Boys, you are missing out on an essential piece of hip-hop history, now matter how you slice it. This classic-filled gem may be one of the funnest rides in the history of rap. This was just the first of many outstanding albums from this unstoppable trio.

Good from start to finish and like the Boss' old stuff.    \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" is a great summer song.    One of the memorable CD's from 2007 for me.
0441009425|4.0|Don't be put off by the label of \\"hard\\" science fiction.  This book contains some hard science backdrop, to be sure, but by and large it is a sprawling novel with some interesting, and interestingly flawed, characters.  Those readers who generally prefer fantasy-type science fiction or military-oriented sci-fi will probably not like this book so well.  It is not action-packed.  Neither the climax nor the denouement is completely satisfying, but this book reminds me of Cavafi's poem Ithaka: this is about the journey, not about arriving at a destination.  If the journey is rich enough, you will not feel cheated at the final destination.  This book, its storyline, and its characters definitely make the journey rich.
B00005JPS8|5.0|As far as I am concerned, this is the best movie I have seen all year and I see alot of them. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as well as the supporting cast. This movie never drags, is funny, shocking and thrilling. Better than all of the big hits put together, including The Dark Knight.
B0010X745K|5.0|Brillantly made film - glad the director refused to change the ending - it really is a shocker and you really feel it.    The effects work well, the lady playing the religious woman plays the part to perfection - never doing anything just telling and the people around react to it...    Worth watching time after time to see the parts you missed.
140130916X|3.0|The book is a lot like the protagonist, Holly, flawed but sweet. The heart of the story, truly what I found the most moving, was any scene with Holly reading and cherishing the monthly letters from her unfortunately deceased husband, Gerry.     Strangely enough, I found Gerry to be one of my favorite characters despite the lack of his physical presence in much of the novel. He seemed much more charming and likable than other characters of the novel. (Perhaps because the novel drew on his adoring widow's perspective.)    I wish we had learned a bit more backstory about the many characters of the novel, but alas.... we did not.     Though the writing was sappy and drawn out at its worst, it is very sweet and poignant at its best. P.S. I Love You was an enjoyable read about prioritizing one's life, coping with grief and loving yourself.
B000LZ53N8|5.0|A Japanese press of Muse's Black Holes and Revelations. As with all (to my experience) Japanese releases, it has a lyrics insert (both in English and Japanese if you care for either).  Great complement to this CD is a bonus track (Glorious), awesome song, which is also available on their single CD, Invincible. There is a bonus DVD with some vids that (quite honestly) I haven' got a chance to see yet. I waited for a Japanese release just because the album was so solidly great (which is SO rare in our ring-tone-song-for-a-day times!), and I expected some sort of a bonus on it. It was absolutely worth it!!!

0316143472|4.0|David Sedaris' latest collection is well worth reading, or even better, listening to.  I listened to When You are Engulfed in Flames as an audio-book, read by the author.  Sedaris' deadpan delivery is priceless.  Four of the stories in this collection are recorded live.  These stories are among the best in the collection, but they are enhanced by a live audience (those pregnant pauses, the anticipation, and the delirious laughter that follows each punchline).<br /><br />Sedaris' stories (or essays, as they are often referred to) are amusing, presumably real-life, anecdotes about the mundane.  These are like the stories told by the funniest guy at a dinner party.<br /><br />As with any collection of stories (or essays), some are better than others.  When You are Engulfed in Flames actually gets off to a weak start, leading off with the least engaging story in the bunch (It's Catching).  The second story (Keeping Up) is amusing enough, but I was starting to think about listening to something else at this point.  The next few stories were quite a bit funnier (I particularly liked Road Trips and What I Learned).  By this point I was hooked.  The audio version really hits its stride with the live readings of In the Waiting Room, Solutions to Saturdays Puzzle, Memento Mori, and Town and Country.  The remainder of the collection doesn't maintain the same quality but all are entertaining enough (Of Mice and Men is the highlight of the `back end').  The final story, Smoking Section, is by far the longest story in the collection (25% of the CD space) and unfortunately, it's an uneven effort.  Smoking Section feels like raw material that hasn't been properly culled. There is enough material in the story to create 3 or 4 short essays (I especially enjoyed David's foray into the world of competitive swimming).  As it is, it lacks focus and rambles on.<br /><br />In Canada we have a much beloved story-teller named Stuart McLean who is virtually unknown outside the Great White North (we also watch a uniquely Canadian television show called Corner Gas and drink coffee at a place called Tim Horton's).  David Sedaris is similar to McLean in that he tells amusing anecdotes' to the delight of many; however there is a distinct difference.  McLean is strictly G rated entertainment; sentimental and charming.  Sedaris, while not R rated, is delivering PG material.  Readers and listeners should be prepared for coarse language, sexual content, and references to recreational drug use.  Some may find Sedaris' humour to be a little caustic. (Although many of us like caustic humour)<br /><br />All in all, this is a highly entertaining collection of stories.  If you don't feel inclined to read them all, I suggest you consider picking up When You are Engulfed in Flames and reading Memento Mori, Solutions to Saturdays Puzzle, Town and Country, In the Waiting Room, What I Learned, Of Mice and Men, and Road Trips.

0307277887|3.0|So often a novel is turned into a film and is dramatically edited in order to fit it all into a 2 hour movie.  The opposite is true when a book is turned into TV show, like Darkly Dreaming Dexter.  In this case, the premise and basic story-line of a 300 page novel is stretched into a full season of hour-long cable TV shows.  The result, of course, is that the TV show features considerably more detail, subplots, and character development.  Fans of the show are inevitably disappointed by the `thinness' of the novel.<br /><br />That said; some of the grievances are quite valid.  I'm a fan of the TV series, but putting that aside and reviewing Darkly Dreaming Dexter on its literary merits, there are some significant shortcomings to this novel.  While Dexter is fleshed out as a character, the secondary characters are woefully underdeveloped.  In particular, the character of Deb, who Dexter describes as an intelligent capable cop, is portrayed as `not being the sharpest knife in the drawer' and a little whiny to boot.<br /><br />The premise for the novel is ingenious and Dexter's narrative is ripe with sardonic humour, but the plot itself is unremarkable.  The ending feels rushed and the whole novel is somehow unfulfilling - a great idea that just isn't executed well.<br /><br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter isn't a bad novel.  The story zips along quickly.  Unlike the end of series one of the TV show, the novel's resolution is a little nastier and more ambiguous.  I like that.  This novel is worth reading as a kind of curiosity for fans of the TV series, and it's a reasonably entertaining quick read.  While not at the top of my reading list, I suspect I may well read the second instalment to see where Lindsay takes Dexter's story.  3 ½ stars.
0452289963|5.0|Coming from an agnostic viewpoint, this has completely transformed my life.  Most of my life was spent worrying and depressed, and I now enjoy life with more ease, and less anxiety than I've ever had.  All thanks, to the ideas in this book.
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three books. I have always been a fan of Bella and Edward, but I liked how Meyer introduced the Jacob/Bella dynamic to show the complexity of relationships, and that love means SACRIFICE and making a CHOICE. Plot, character, and substance related issues I've had with the series were compensated by the message I believed Meyer wanted to make--Bella choosing to give up a normal life (and everything that comes with it) in order to be with Edward.      Now, I don't know what message the author wanted to say or what she was thinking.    (Spoilers Below)    Bella didn't have to sacrifice anything apparently. She gets Edward AND a baby AND immortality as a vampire. What about poor Jake--not a problem, he IMPRINTS on the baby, which I find disturbing not so much because it is a baby (though that is creepy just as it was with Quil) but because it's Edward and Bella's baby. Can we say cop out? Life doesn't turn out so neatly. People love and lose (and don't fall for the object of their affection's daughter).  But in Meyer's world everyone is one big happy family.     So, girls don't worry. If you have problems, they will ALL work out. Is that what the author wants to tell her fans?    Or is it marriage and family by 18 are the way to go, forget about college, developing as a person, all you need is a husband and a child. No disrespect to people who marry at 18, but Meyer paints a glorified picture of the situation; most 18 years old aren't going to  have an endless supply of money and never worry about how the lack of an education will affect their future. Yes, this is a novel, a fantasy, we shouldn't expect or require realism--then why go the mommy route at all? Just focus on Bella and Edward. Bella didn't want children, yet when she finds out she's pregnant she doesn't even freak out; she's carrying a vampire's child and it's just \\"my heart had grown, swollen up to twice its size in that moment.\\"      Or is the author's message be passive and let others take care of you (what if there is no one else--no, no, girls, there is ALWAYS someone). One of my big issues with the series is how Bella has never had outside interests beyond Edward (or Jake), that she's not an independent person. I hoped Meyer would finally have Bella come into her own in this book, have her lack of personality be the result of high school immaturity or something, but obviously the author thinks a person's entire existence should be defined by others, not themselves. Another great message--not.    Don't even get me started on Bella's power. Again, another major opportunity to strengthen Bella's character is wasted. Also, the explanation of why Edward can get Bella pregnant is ridiculous considering the rules Meyer originally established for her world. The story may be dealing with supernatural/fantastic elements, but it still has to have internal consistency.         I wanted and expected a happy ending. I wanted Bella to become a vampire. I wanted there to be a resolution with Jake. I wanted and expected the Volturi to return. I also expected an intense exploration of pain, sacrifice, vampire Bella having to cope with giving up her family/old life. I wondered if Charlie and Renee would find out--wouldn't it be odd if their child just disappeared--and though a parent does find out (sort of), it was hardly the way I imagined it, especially with the way \\"newborn\\" Bella played out.     I wanted Jake angst about her being changed, him maybe not accepting her at first (or at all) but him coming to deal with it in some fashion so you felt there was closure at the end. I would have been fine with Jake moving on, but not with Edward and Bella's daughter.     Finally, why must Bella get everything? So much for a powerful message, I guess.     \\"You can't expect a message with vampires and werewolves!\\" I disagree. The best fantasy, horror, and science fiction stories all have a morality/deeper element to them. Fairy tales, as they were originally designed, were meant to teach children a valuable lesson. This does not (and should not) lessen the entertainment value of a story, but I think it's a cop out to say \\"it's a fantasy,\\" as if that excuses anything. If you look at Lord of the Rings, The Hero and the Crown, The Phantom Tollbooth, The Last Unicorn, Harry Potter, Stoker's original Dracula novel, The Prydain Chronicles, The Little Prince--all of them deal with themes of sacrifice, choice, gaining wisdom, growing as a person, and/or are thought provoking/contain deeper messages.      Sure Twilight began as a dream, but three other books have followed it. Even getting away from message issues, I still have a problem with the plot and character developments of Breaking Dawn.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I really like this dvd. Jillian is right up my ally.  She's tough and won't let you get away with wimping out but at the same time gives ample encouragement.  I also enjoy the comradarie she has with the other participants.  My only complaint is that the background is a little boring.  I like outdoor venues best.  I definatley recommend this video! :)
B0000C9JFO|5.0|L'Auberge espagnole-- totally what happens when you are studying (esp. Erasmus) abroad. Love, disappointment, parties, even the Catalan mentality is accurately depicted. A cute and frivolous movie! Note: Only in French or Spanish (audio) with English subtitles. A good way to brush up on your French or Castillano!
B00007GZR5|5.0|What Dreams May Come is a great movie that touches on possible aspects of what may follow after death. It posits that there may indeed be a reality, however counter-intuitive, of life after death. This movie is based on the book writen in the 70s. Some may consider the book better than the movie, but as a person who has read the book too, I would not necessarily say that. I think the book is also very good, but at the same time I just think that the book and movie are just different ways of portraying the same subject. Some of the themes and elements are the same, even though the book goes into far more details on the subject.    I just think that the book and movie are both very good, but they are also very different. One is not necessarily better than the other, but the movie rendition of the book, while not an exact replica of the story therein, is a very good rendition. This movie won an Oscar, so that should tell all about how great this motion picture experience really is.    Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Max Von Sidow all do absolutely excellent acting jobs. The special effects are dazzling and tremendous! The concepts about life after death are also very thought provoking. In fact, these concepts are based on alledged facts that Richard Matheson himself uncovered doing research for his book. Even on the front piece of the book he mentions that the research on the subject of life after death in his story is solid and accurate, even though the story itself is fictional account that is woven around the theory of life after death.    For anyone with an open mind and/or has any concerns or interests in what may indeed be the fate of us all after death, I highly recommend this very telling tale. The story is sometimes shocking, sometimes happy and sometimes very sad. But overall I don't think anyone seeing this movie will be disappointed in it whatsoever. I think most people will be pleasantly surprised by the story and special effects and the intellectualstimulation they may get out of watching this film.    5 stars!
031606792X|1.0|This was really a surprising read...and not in a good way. The pure amateur plot points of this story amazes me that it came from the same writer of the previous 3 stories.     *spoilers ahead*    I could not believe what S.Meyer chose to do to these characters. She contradicts her own mythos and self-created realm. If it was in any of her books, this last one shows how unfamiliar she is with vampire mythos.     The pro - The characterization. With the exception of Bella and Edward, all the characters were written decently. But it's a shame, since B/E are the main characters. Jacob was also enjoyable to read.     The CONS -  -Terrible \\"plot twist\\" with pregnant Bella. I felt like I was watching a bad episode of *insert supernatural show here* during sweeps, where the creators were desperate for some ratings.   -Even more vomit-inducing names. Did SM really think it clever to hybrid maternal and paternal names together?   -Jacob's imprint. I have no words... maybe: \\"WHAT THE ****?\\"  -There are so many more, but I felt these are the main ones.    All in all, It think I have read better fanfiction than this. Wait, did I say that right? YOU BET I DID! Fanfiction writers should sue.... oh wait it doesn't work that way.       I suggest borrowing from a friend or library. If you've already purchased this, check the refund policy. I'm returning the book tomorrow myself.
031606792X|2.0|It seemed that with each new book in the captivating Twilight series that Stephanie Meyer created fresh, emotional, and somehow realistic (in spite of the obvious supernatural connection) plotlines with the solid characters we've grown to love. Except, that is, for this final installment. (**Spoiler Warning**)<br /><br />Was I expecting Edward and Bella to declare their undying (literally) love? Of course. Did I think Jacob would finally imprint? Certainly. Did I suspect that there would be an ultimate showdown between the Cullens and their various antagonists? Without a shadow of a doubt. These, at least, Stephanie Meyer does deliver.<br /><br />But I did NOT expect it all to play out as it did in Breaking Dawn. Right from the get-go, Breaking Dawn seems to cast its familiar characters in unfamiliar, uncharacteristic lights. It then manages to go from awkward to just plain weird and wrong. Its soap opera-esque qualities could be expected to be found in any trashy, run-of-the-mill vampire/sci-fi paperback- not our beloved Twilight Series! In the story's narration, it was almost a relief to get into Jacob Black's semi-normal werewolf brain, as opposed to idling in Edward-Bella Impossible/Odd Conflict Land. The return to Bella's point of view is slightly more grounded, but unrelatable, predictable, and... just weird. Not even her long-awaited transformation can make up for the cheesy, random events that any amateur fan fiction writer could have cooked up.<br /><br />When I waited in line at my local bookstore, counting down the seconds until I could hold this book in my hands, I was expecting, if not a masterpiece, at least something equivalent to its predecessors. What I got instead was a total whirlwhind of \\"WHAT?\\"s and \\"Are you serious?\\"es. Yes, Ms. Meyer may claim that this is the finish always intended for Edward and Bella. But, to be honest, I kind of wish she'd have just kept this ending to herself and left us hanging with realistic, relatable, satisfying decisions made in Eclipse. One can't help but wonder if the only reason Meyer wrote what she wrote was to keep from avoiding any cliches or \\"boring\\" expectations. If that was the case, I wish her a congratulations. We're not bored, but we are totally confused, weirded out, and miffed.<br /><br />Readers are, at least, spared an unfinished or depressing ending. Sighs of relief are allowable. However, I almost would have rather had a few more sufferings if it meant that the ending of this book were as thematic, inspiring, and downwright sophisticated as the denoument of this saga could and should have been.e can't help but wonder if the only reason Meyer wrote what she wrote was to keep from avoiding any cliches or \\"boring\\" expectations.

0743277708|5.0|I had never read this book in highschool like i had heard that many people had.  I am kinda sorry i was not able to when i was younger.  Oh well.  I am only about 3/4 of the way through this book and it is hard to put down!  Very interesting.  Very different.  I recommend everyone give it a read at least once in their life.  Worth it all the way.
B000RZGFYS|5.0|I'm just shocked on how a lot of people prefer those sellouts Metallica to Slayer. There are no orchestras here, no Bob Seger covers, just 28 minutes of pure, classic thrash metal. Other than the epic \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood\\" (5 and a little over 4 mins. respectively) every song here is short, fast, and right to the point, and with Tom Araya's rapid-fire vocals, that's the way they should be. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman trade their guitar solos nicely, and Dave Lombardo's blistering double bass puts him in a league of his own. Although Araya's bass is barely noticeable, his high-pitched screams and vocals more than make up for it. I listen to this album constantly and never tire of it; you won't either.

0446607274|5.0|Another night spent with Harry into the wee hours.  The author just keeps the suspense growing and twists twistier.  I wasn't prepared to like this novel as much as the others.  An attorney who lives to sue the LAPD -- and picks the race card out of every deck he's dealt -- and all the politicos covering their collective butts -- no thanks.  But this was REALLY a good read.  Of course, as usual, the FBI and IAD hassle Harry at every turn and he always has somebody trying to bring him down.  That part gets older with each new book.  But you gotta love Harry -- he just keeps fighting.  Does it bother anyone else that Harry carries a briefcase?  It just doesn't ring true to his character.  I'm seeing Dirty Harry one minute and then Poindexter the Geek the next.  Do homicide dectectives carry briefcases?  All the more reason Harry would not.

The story was well developed, and also I thought one that is true many times in everyday life.  As a gay man, it was worth the time and money spent at the theatre and when I purchased it for home use.  ENJOY!

B000UBMWG4|5.0|By now, you can find plenty of reviews of the content of this phenomenal Blu-Ray set, so go to them if you're looking for depth, as this is just a brief review to commend Warner for FINALLY putting this five-disc set into a standard-sized Blu-Ray case (though it's NOT shown in the customer images provided for this listing).<br /><br />Received my second copy of this title in late July after picking it up during the $14.99 sale price, and was quite relieved to find a case no wider than 14mm thick! The previous \\"double-wide\\" was around 22-23mm, a full centimeter wider, and while that wasn't exactly hefty, it still smacked of unnecessarily making the product \\"seem\\" bigger than it needed to be because of the importance of the film within.<br /><br />Basically, the construction of this new case is the same as the old: two flip trays on hinges, with an additional disc mounted on a hub on the inside back of the case. Only now, the flip trays are thin enough to fit in a Blu case that's only a millimeter or so wider than the standard-issue single-disc case.<br /><br />I can only hope that ALL future Blu releases of up to five discs would consider a case like this. In an age where storage for the average DVD enthusiast -- esepcially the kind that collects titles like this one -- is at a premium, the less packaging, and \\"air\\", the better.<br /><br />No guarantees you'll actually get this package when you order, as the double-wide case appears to be out there concurrently with this new one, and you're liable to get either from Amazon, so it's at least something to keep an eye peeled for should you choose to buy this in the store.
031606792X|1.0|This book completely destroyed a wonderful series that used to be among my favorites, if not my favorite.  The events that occurred and the sudden change in the essence of who the main characters are...  it is absolutely ridiculous.  I wish I had never read this book and could still have the memory of the first three in my mind untarnished by this.  Now that's destroyed.  With what she's done to the characters and the story in this book I don't know if I'll even be able to sit through the movie, or a rereading of the earlier books, let alone enjoy it.  If you haven't picked this up yet and are into the series, whatever you do, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.  Just enjoy the first three untarnished by the fourth.  Can I get the money and time back that I wasted on this?
B000N6TYLW|3.0|Why did Amy Sherman-Palladino have to leave! The other seasons where genius. The second she leaves the ratings and quality of the show plummet. Why, oh why?! As much as it hurts me to say this I'd give this one a C-.
B00029LNHS|4.0|This rap CD is very mainstream but at the same time quite excellent. Words can't quite describe the best tracks on the album. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) is track in the first batch of tracks that really gets you pumped and ready to dance. Sexy is extremely melancholy for Black Eyed Peas and has them touching on a jazz-lite tone. The lazy horns really do it for me. It's a favorite. The Boogie That Be (another fave) is very sexy. It's another track you can dance to and what Fergie says in the bridge might get you in the mood. ;) She sings wonderfully on this disc.<br /><br />If you like Rap with a mix of R&B and Pop, get this. There is also a Rock-ish song called Anxiety (Feat. Papa Roach) that my cousin LOVED when this CD came out. It's truly good stuff.<br /><br />4.4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Labor Day (It's A Holiday)\\"<br />\\"The Boogie That Be\\"<br />\\"Anxiety\\" &<br />\\"Sexy\\"

Not only did she enjoy it, she was encouraged to go out doors and find her own fantastical creatures. She had such a great time 'seeing' the same creatures that are in the book, but in her own environment.  She keeps it with her constantly to ensure that the ogre cannot get it.. It has really opened her imagination up...plus, I enjoy looking at it with her.  Worth the money to have it in her collection along with the other Spiderwick books we already have.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Best, most dream-inspiring story ever written and an absolutely wonderful film adaptation.  I own both this one and the A&E version (also wonderful - I love Colin Firth).  This one was soooo beautifully filmed and well done.  The actors were all very well cast and did their parts incredible justice.      Please, no one wake me and tell me that Keira Knightly is not Lizzie and that Matthew McFayden isn't Darcy, or that there is such a man or such a love somewhere in the world.  They were perfect and I want to imagine that they still enjoy each other's beautiful company at Pemberly.    If I ever watch this movie and don't have my head cocked dreamily to the side with tears streaking my face as he says 'Mrs. Darcy' over and over at the end, know that my heart has gone cold.    When you need to escape, this is the dvd to put in...
031606792X|5.0|After devouring the first three novels in less than a week, I was anxious to find out how human Bella and her vampire fiance would end their story.  I'd read other people's theories and came up with a few of my own, but the actual book was more than I even hoped for.    First off, I wouldn't reccommend this book for anyone under 15, as it contains some more mature themes.  I actually think it's surpassed the Young Adult genre.    But aside from that, Stephenie Meyer took a story that could have been utterly predictible from first page to last.  Instead, the plotline keeps you guessing the whole way through with plenty of stops for smiles and tears among the way.    It seems like a lot of people didn't enjoy it, but I think that's because everything was so unexpected.  But the plot twists were always well explained and as believable as believable can be when we're discussing a world of vampires and werewolves.    Meyer's strength in writing is definitely the vivid characters she creates.  While they sometimes come under fire for the choices they make, it's important to understand that they are human and will undoubtedly make mistakes, something I love about reading these books.    Bella is, in my opinion, a very strong minded character, especially in this book where she gets her chance to be the hero.  She really started growing up from teenager to adult in Eclipse, realizing the consequences of her actions, and that transformation is only strengthened in Breaking Dawn.  She also fights harder for the things and people that are important to her and comes to realize just how incredible she really is (nevermind the fact that Edward's been trying to tell her so since Twilight).    Jacob, on the other hand, wasn't a character I immediately liked.  After re-reading New Moon and Eclipse, I almost liked him apart from his attempts at manipulating Bella (once again, humans make mistakes, and so do werewolves).  In Breaking Dawn, however, we're granted a look into his psyche,and it's hard not to like him after that.  The imprinting of Jacob is something that didn't upset me (an opinion not shared by othe reviewers), Meyer has already described the phenomenon in Eclipse to the point where it seems almost commonplace.  To me, it made sense.  Jacob loved Bella, but she was unable to be happy with him.  It didn't seem fair at all to have him forever unhappy.  He's made mistakes in the past, but hasn't everyone?    And of course, Edward.  Despite the cold skin and still heart, Edward's probably the most human character in the series.  His pain and anguish, the way he tortures himself to constantly do what's right for Bella, and later his daughter Nessie were so palpable and raw that the words went straight for my heart.  Like everyone, Edward isn't perfect.  He's less calm and sure of things in Breaking Dawn, a dramatic change from the Edward of books past.  By the same token, he's also a lot more free with his emotions as well.    The other characters, Rosalie, Alice, Jasper, Emmet, Carlisle, Esme, Charlie, Seth, Sam and some new vampires all have their moments in the spotlight, especially the formerly reclusive Rosalie who joins forces with Bella (shock).    One of my favorite characters was Leah Clearwater.  In Eclipse, she tended to get on my last nerve, but in Breaking Dawn she comes alive as a lonely girl, nursing a broken heart and the wounded pride that comes with having that heart laid out for everyone (well everyone in the story) to see.  Admittedly, I was hoping for a romance to between her and Jacob.  Was I the only one seeing sparks there?    I enjoyed this book heartily and can't wait to re-read it already!  I'd reccommend for anyone to read it twice.  The first time through, I think everyone is so anxious to find out the ending that they skip over a lot of important parts that make the book enjoyable, so a second read might improve your opinions.  :)
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Even if you love another version or are a stickler for the book, please try this version and watch it with an open heart.  It is a gloriously done beautiful movie and will leave you reeling with romance and good feelings.  There is a definitely chemistry between these fine actors...    Fabulous - I buy very few DVD's, this is one I have and will watch often.
0060523808|4.0|The critics were predicting IBM's demise when he took the rains, apparently after much prodding.  He took the bold step of listening to customers and cutting the price of their cash cow, the 360, to raise cash.  He also decided that the business model (proprietary) that had worked for IBM in the 50s-70s just wasn't going to work,  and he made a big bet on middleware and services.    What's important to his management philosophy?  First, he considers big to be good: IBM doesn't have to scrounge for resources to do something.  He also loves to win and wants to hear the same from his people.      That said, the book reads a bit like he's trying to sell us IBM: the brand.  I also find myself asking what it means to save IBM if he has to lose almost 200K employees (they were hired back eventually) and change the culture.  How much can you change something and keep it the same?
0743290119|1.0|It only has a star because Amazon made me...    This was chosen by a book club member as our summer selection.  I was unhappy to see that it was a chick lit book - and then angry after I read it.  It was so poorly written that it had no business being published.  The cost of this thin little piece of stuff is ridiculous.    Please do not support this kind of book - and maybe the publishers will raise the bar for future authors.
031606792X|1.0|Some of the comments I receive made me want to change this review.    Slight spoiler:    This book is about the conceiving of an Abomination and the decision to abort the baby. Even going so far as to planning out how it would be done.    This book goes one step further when the offer is made for the main character to conceive some other mans child. Jacob can just borrow Bella for the weekends.    Goes deeper into the pit of nasty when only a vampire can munch the placenta up into little bits...nothing else will do. Seriously yuck.    Hits rock bottom when a character falls in love with an infant. Cheesy as well.     /End Spoilers.    Am I wrong?    This is the nasty. There is 755 pages of melodrama, and indecision as we wade our way through the swampy Meyer that presents itself as a romantic teen novel.     The characters aren't consistent with the previous books.     The book draws you in on a high note, gets you going by presenting what you want, then the bottom falls out...and you're left with something that isn't romantic, and goes beyond poor taste.       Personally I'm ashamed for those of you that serious enjoyed reading this filth.
B000056TKC|5.0|After reading various reviews on this site (and others) of this and other recordings of Beethoven's 9th, I decided to select this one, and I'm glad I did.  It is an excellent \\"all-around\\" recording of one of the greatest classical works of all time.  From the quality of the sound/recording (vocal and orchestral), to the nearly flawless execution by the performers, to the interpretation of the work by the conductor -- this is truly great from an overall perspective.  There are many terrific recordings of the 9th (I also own Karajan/Berlin and Furtwangler/Bayreuth Festival, and have heard a number of others, such as Bernstein at the Berlin Wall), but this one stands out as one of the finest.  For a wonderful survey of the various recordings available, check out this informative article by Carl Nelson on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PIMO74V323TZ.
1401201911|5.0|This is one of Superman's best books.  Millar hits a home run with this Elseworlds book.  Elseworlds only means it's an alternative world, meaning it's not in continuity, meaning it's not boggled down with current DC stories or status.  Whew.  But who cares as long as the story is good and the characterization is respectful.  In fact, many Elseworlds stories are far better than the stories \\"in continuity\\", meaning it's far more creative and far more interesting than the same old drivel used again and again.    Lex takes the cake in this series.  He's amazing.  Superman is superman.  Sure he's Russia's Superman, but Lex is the American hero in this series.  And we all know Lex is a genius who is only human, but can cripple an alien Man of Steel, the World's hero and moral standard.  But Superman is not Superman with Lex.  The story takes the readers on a journey that challenges Superman's relevance on Earth.  Somewhat political in tone, it's still an old fashioned super-hero wham bam comic book.  But it is ever so intriguing and vast in scope.    Highly recommended.

0785125965|2.0|I have been a HULK fan for decades.  Although I do not buy HULK comics at the comic store, I often buy HULK trade paperbacks and Graphic Novels with HULK in it.    Highly recommended are HULK and Thing: The Big Change.  Planet Hulk.  Various Peter David HULK runs.  HULK: The End.  HULK: Future Imperfect.    This is supposed to be a no-brainer recommendation,but I cannot recommend it for casual comic fans.  I think HULK fans will tolerate this limited series, but it can easily be forgettable.  First off, the art is not that great.  I'm not a fan of John Romita Jr. and I acknowledge he's a living legend, but his drawing style is hit or miss.  I'm opting for pass on his art here.  The writing should be superb, as it is written by HULK savior Pak.  but I cannot see his genius nor can I feel the intensity of HULK's smashing in this series.    World War HULK has a lot of Marvel Universe heroes, but the smashing is at times boring and all too generic.  Heroes weren't born and villains weren't terrifying. Hulk smashed but so what?  Where was the major characterization or the major significance that resulted or arose?  This needed to be major and for 19.99, it didn't deliver.    I do not recommend this book for casual fans and for those who want to try out HULK, try the recommended books above.  Don't bother with this one.  Marvel comics puts out books much better than this and so spend your money elsewhere.

031606792X|2.0|I just finished BD and I'm left confused and dazed. Did I read everything correctly? B&E having a child and then Jacob imprinting on said child.... that seems beyond comprehension to me. And I found the \\"sex scenes\\" to be completely retarded. Even if SM didn't want to go into detail she could have done better than \\"he led her into the sea and then they woke up the next morning\\". There was no magic between B&E like in the other three books. I mean in Eclipse we have that astounding bedroom scene between B&E and there is nothing like that in BD. But instead we get gross scenes of Bella giving \\"birth\\" and having to drink blood (when she's human). The only thing that redeems this book for me is the last third. Mainly the last few paragraphs, where Bella figures out how to let Edward read her thoughts. In fact, that scene might have been the only scene in the book that I felt even remotely reflected the past three books. Right now I'm very disappointed, but who knows maybe this will grow on me.
031606792X|3.0|um...So first where did it go wrong....What was Stephanie thinking when she wrote this? It contradicted everything in her previous books and made the characters unlikable. I could no longer relate to Bella and Edward just plain pissed me off. I like Jake till the end, then anything i felt for him was turned into disgust. Imprinting on a little baby is just wrong. The only character I loved was Seth and hes isn't even a main one....Please say this is a really bad joke and the real book hasn't come out yet.I just wasted 5 hrs of my life....Save yourself time,money and disappointment and buy something else..

B0017R5UAA|3.0|(NOTE:  This is an edited review.  I've revised my opinion of this band.  Originally, I gave the record 3 stars.  But I've been listening to it for awhile and now give it 4 stars.)    Fleet Foxes is an indie band from Seattle who grew up listening to the music of the '60's - their parents' music -- and the influence of the 60's on Fleet Foxes is obvious.  The Beach Boys' vocal harmonies and complex arrangements stand out (ditto Crosby Stills & Nash), as do folky Simon & Garfunkel guitar licks and Beatles-style melodic lines.  The results are uneven:  sometimes very well-orchestrated and moving, sometimes predictable and unremarkable.  On the whole, the vocals are great, although occasionally the group singing is not in tune.  The lyrics are sometimes obscure in meaning or hard to hear. I wish they were articulated better, because there's no lyric sheet enclosed.    FF has taken the familiar elements I mention above, and run them through the filters of their generation, personal experiences and original musical ideas, and come up with something I haven't heard before.  Their music creates an interesting emotional state that's at once wistful, joyful, melancholic, mysterious and childlike.  And like the best music of the 60's, FF also rocks. Props go to the drummer, who adds a nice groove to many of these otherwise ethereal songs.    FF gets points for creating songs that are more than your standard drum beat, yelling (or whining), and loud guitars.  They're doing something original, in a more complex vocal and instrumental style than I've heard in awhile, one which incorporates folk, rock, Celtic and country.  Fleet Foxes is a tuneful, lively, colorful and uplifting set of songs that passes the repeated listenings test.      I'm intrigued by this unusual band and will be following them in the future.
B000WS4QJG|2.0|I rememeber when Thriller first came out and every one was in it to it.I for one must say that some of the songs are good but as whole album it falls flat.If you want a great Michael Jackson album from start to finish I would highly recommend his best album period:Off THe Wall!!! Off The Wall was on the billboard hot 100 albun charts for like 8 years!!!! what does that tell you? Thriller was on there for maybe a year tops.Off The Wall sold 10 million records and 10 million tapes.I say download maybe PYT and Human Nature from I-Tunes.Thriller got old for me real quick and the songs get real tiresome.I real over rated album.Off the Wall on the other hand,every song is great from start to finish.The songs from Off THe Wall still hold up well today.
031606792X|1.0|This series went from being fun, mindless entertainment to simultaneously reminding me of Rosemary's Baby and Pulp Fiction (seriously, that birth scene was potentially the least romantic way possible to become a vampire).     It seems that Meyer has substituted Bella being a parent for Bella actually becoming responsible. These things do not automatically go hand in hand, and it ends up making Bella an even worse role model.    Also, I have taken issue with the werewolves imprinting on infants before, and this book just adds even more creepy to an already creepy topic. Jacob falls in love with the daughter of the girl he professed to love just months before, when the kid is barely out of the womb.    The \\"sex\\" in the book is a victim of bad editing. It's hard to write something age-appropriate on this topic, I understand. But it comes across like Meyers wrote actual sex scenes, with the not-PG parts sloppily cropped out, either by her or her editor.    I could go on and on about all the things that this book just got wrong, but suffice to say, I wish I had just stopped reading the series before this book came out. I almost wish I had never become interested in the books at all.
B0013J30W2|4.0|With the massive success of numerous comic book films over the last decade or so, most of which have been based on well-known characters, eventually the Hollywood studios would gain enough confidence in the genre to tread into somewhat unknown territory by attempting to adapt lesser-known comic books. Hollywood has previously dabbled with the somewhat obscure characters and comic books to a small degree, although their success rate has been hit and miss; the attempts that worked, and worked very well I might add, were films like \\"Men in Black\\" or the blockbuster \\"300\\"; however, the ones that missed seemed to strike out just as massively as the others had succeeded, examples would be \\"Elektra\\", the spin-off from \\"Daredevil\\" and \\"Zoom: Academy for Superheroes\\". The appeal for movie studios to adapt more unknown titles would seem a somewhat risky proposition, but Universal had found great success with their gamble on `Hellboy', so perhaps their confidence was a bit stronger than most. Which brings us to Universal's most recent film adaptation based on a lesser-known comic book, the critically praised and fan boy approved, hard-edged and extremely violent \\"Wanted\\" based on Mark Millar's comic book miniseries of the same name.    \\"Wanted\\" is the story of a weak-willed accountant named Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy), who lives an unenviable life where his girlfriend cheats on him, his boss verbally abuses him, and essentially everyone around him does nothing but take advantage of him every minute of his life. One moment everything in his life seems to be as mundane as ever, until a sexy woman by the name of Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from a would-be assassin and his routinely boring life. Now, Wesley is offered the chance of a lifetime from a mysterious man named Sloan (Morgan Freeman), who leads a group of assassins called The Fraternity, to embrace his hidden killer instinct and become the assassin he was destined to be.    With Hollywood's successful comic book adaptations it seems a good rule of thumb would be to retain as much of the source material as possible, or else the comic fan base will turn on the property faster than you'd believe. Generally, I completely agree with the rule of staying true to the comic book material, and almost every single time an adaptation strays too far from its origins the movie flops massively; however, with \\"Wanted\\" I would have to be cliché in saying that sometimes rules are made to be broken. Helmed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov making his American directorial debut, and written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas (writers of \\"3:10 to Yuma\\"), along with Chris Morgan (\\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\"), \\"Wanted\\" loosely follows the storyline of the comic book miniseries written by acclaimed writer Mark Millar. The movie changes some of the characters from the miniseries, removes all of the costumes (aside from some subtle nods with Angelina Jolie's leather attire), along with the notion that superheroes and villains existed at one point but no longer; however, with all these changes being made from the source material, series creator Mark Millar was still in approval of the production, even acknowledging his own wish to have removed the costumes from the comic book, though he never got around to it.    The screenplay is a mixture of reality based and somewhat science-fiction tinged dialogue and mind-bending action sequences, mixed with an interesting approach to the concept of predestination, all fitting perfectly together for a film in the vein of \\"The Matrix\\". The story is extremely fast-paced, providing a semi-origin tale that takes the traditional origin sequences and puts its own spin on them, along with some truly innovative special effects sequences, and enough action set pieces to satisfy even the most ardent of action junkies. The characters are not the deepest you'll find in a movie, comic book or otherwise, but there's enough development sprinkled throughout to keep each character interesting for the audience, and not leave them waiting impatiently for the next fight to occur.    After so many CGI-intensive movies being released year after year, enabling directors and their special effects wizards to create virtually anything their imaginations can conceive of, it is surprising to me to still be able to watch a movie that manages to achieve some originality in the realm of CGI and action sequences. I thought I had seen almost anything that Hollywood could come up with by this point, but director Timur Bekmambetov and his team of creative special effects masters have crafted a truly awesome visual experience that will leave you saying, \\"Wow, I have never seen that before!\\" For some, \\"Wanted\\" seemed to be the movie that the two `Matrix' sequels (especially the final one, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\") should have been. I for one enjoyed the two `Matrix' sequels, but that's for another time, either way \\"Wanted\\" is definitely a movie that is just as innovative in its presentation as anything found in `The Matrix' trilogy. Although the storyline isn't nearly as deep or complicated, or even confusing in some spots, as `The Matrix' trilogy, I believe \\"Wanted\\" is still just as much of a fun and entertaining experience as the former.    Of course, the success of this movie wouldn't be possible without the terrific work done by the three leads in the movie, James McAvoy (\\"Atonement\\"), Angelina Jolie (\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\"), and Morgan Freeman (\\"The Dark Knight\\"). It is a testament to the talent of these superstars to be able to give credibility, and even some depth to such a far-fetched story, and still be able to walk away with their respect intact and their \\"cool\\" factor definitely through the roof. Anybody that has seen any of James McAvoy's previous films will no doubt be surprised by not only his choice of signing on to a movie such as this, but also by the fact that he pulls off the role of an action hero surprisingly well. Angelina Jolieis no stranger to action heroines due to her successful turns in the `Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' movies and \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\", though lately she has done more serious dramatic acting, it was nice to see her cut loose once again and still look just as good doing it as she ever did. Veteran actor Morgan Freeman is another big surprise to find in this movie, sure he's done the last two `Batman' films, but this role comes much more out of left field than any of his previous work, yet he still gives a great performance. On a side note, there is something strangely humorous about hearing Morgan Freeman channel his inner Samuel L. Jackson at one point in this film.    \\"Wanted\\" is by far one of the most visually impressive action films you will ever see, with an interesting story that moves at break neck speed, but doesn't allow for a whole lot of character development, although you don't really miss it. The movie is extremely violent and proud of it I might add, approaching the action genre with a boldness to push itself hard into an R rating, a move that many films (action or otherwise) seem afraid to do here lately.    \\"Wanted\\" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.

031606792X|2.0|I was never a fan of Eclipse and had hoped that Breaking Dawn would recapture some of the magic that I found in the first two books of the series.    Sadly, I didn't read the reviews before I purchased the book because I wanted to judge for myself but they were all right and made valid points.    I gave the book two stars and not one because without SM, we wouldn't have had Twilight.  However, SM really let the fans down with this book.  Well, speaking for myself- this fan anyway.     I agree that she broke some of the rules in BD that she had set up in Twilight. I am not going to ruin the book for those who need opinions without giving the story away.     Besides I would just be echoing the sentiments already written. I will go on to say that the novel was poorly written, the characters I once loved-unrecognizable and some of the subject matter just down right repulsive.    I didn't mind the fairytale ending because I wanted one, I just disliked how she got there.      BD was asking me to sacrifice the last of the magic I originally found in the series.  So what was the point? We have our fairytale ending but is it a good sign when you finish a book and wonder what the heck you just read and why do I feel tragically short changed?

B0018AK9RA|5.0|I am STUNNED!!! Wow, what a masterpiece! The mighty Priest have outdone themselves!<br /><br />I've been a fan since the beginning, Rocka Rolla, and their early masterpiece, Sad Wings of Destiny. Over the years, nothing had ever topped that...until now.<br /><br />Rob's still got THE VOICE. Exquisite! He doesn't have to use harsh vocals to sound heavy, and he can still reach those highs. On this album, he not only proves he's still got it, but he reaches even higher, stretching his already masterful range. He even ventures into operatic singing that is just incredible!<br /><br />Musically, Priest show that they have indeed evolved. Rather than trying to copy the new generation of metal, they have produced a masterful work that is totally their own...advanced JP! Rich, orchestral, complex, deep, heavy, emotionally evocative, musically mature...this is most definitely their FINEST WORK.<br /><br />And that, for those in the know, is saying quite a lot.
B001BWDG0W|4.0|I suppose the first thing to say is that yes, I'm a pretty big ABBA fan - I grew up listening to them, and know at least the songs from their GOLD album word for word.  And no, this album isn't ABBA, but it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />The real singing talent in the Mamma Mia! cast belongs to Amanda Seyfried, Christine Baranski, and Meryl Streep.  Amanda Seyfried does an excellent job on songs like \\"I Have A Dream\\" and \\"Honey, Honey\\" (as well as \\"The Name of the Game,\\" though it was cut from the film), though I felt her version of \\"Thank You For the Music\\" from the end credits of the film is a bit bare without the harmony and lush music of the ABBA version.<br /><br />Christine Baranski sizzles on \\"Does Your Mother Know,\\" and provides nice harmony with Meryl Streep and Julie Walters on other songs, such as \\"Super Trouper\\" and \\"Dancing Queen.\\"  Meryl Streep is a decent singer in her own right, and does very well on \\"Mamma Mia,\\" but her real knockout number is \\"The Winner Takes It All,\\"  which, after 3 viewings, remains my favorite number from the film. Streep's vocals are incredible here; what she lacks in talent she makes up for with raw emotion.  Streep also does well on \\"Slipping Through My Fingers,\\" a song I wasn't previously familiar with, but loved.  While ABBA's vocals are superior, of course, I preferred the simple, wistful arrangement from the film to their version.<br /><br />None of the three men are outstanding singers; Colin Firth's voice is too thin and high, and Stellan Skarsgard is merely passable.  Pierce Brosnan, though he's taken a lot of criticism, isn't THAT bad.  He struggles on \\"SOS\\" and \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do,\\" but comes through reasonably well on \\"Our Last Summer\\" and is really pretty good on \\"When All Is Said & Done.\\"  I really enjoyed \\"When All Is Said And Done,\\" and also preferred the film arrangement and lyrics to the original; I never cared much for ABBA's version, but the film version is my second-favorite track.  I find Brosnan's voice improves a bit once you get accustomed to it, anyway.<br /><br />All in all, it's not ABBA, but it's a fun use of ABBA's songs--I was amazed how well they fit the songs into the plot.  There's a mix of talent, but overall it's enjoyable.  The biggest drawback to this album is some missing material.  \\"Chiquitita\\" and \\"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do\\" are seen in the film, though only in part.  Still, \\"Chiquitita\\" featured enough in the film that I feel it warranted a soundtrack spot, especially since \\"The Name of the Game,\\" which DID get a soundtrack spot, isn't in the film at all.  Also, \\"Waterloo,\\" which is performed during the (hilarious) credits in its entirety, is inexplicably absent.  It's one of my favorite ABBA songs and the film version was good, so I'm disappointed to see it missing.  My four star rating is entirely due to this, not to the quality of the music.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie and any ABBA fans, as long as you're not the type to criticize every little deviation from the original.it once you get accustomed to it, anyway.

1400023343|5.0|My husband and I speak different languages and we are expecting our first child. She is also my parents' first grandchild and they are crazy about her. Unfortunately, my parents do not speak English, and my in-laws do not speak Spanish. For us it is very important that our child has the best of both cultures and that she grows up as an independent child that is able to express herself.    We found this book interesting, very informative and easy to read. It is a great educational tool for parents who believe in spending time with their children rather than sitting them in front of the TV.

031606792X|2.0|So, I reviewed this book earlier and gave it three stars.  I deleted that review and am now giving it two.  The more I think about it, the more I realize how disappointed I am with it and that I was just trying to convice myself to like it.  I'm giving it two stars rather than one b/c there were some parts that I did like- when Bella first becomes a vampire, the wedding, and the epilogue where Edward finally gets to see her thoughts.      SM really did change her characters but not in a way that caused them to \\"grow.\\"  In fact, most of them became one dimensional- including Jacob and Edward.  I think she lost the focus of the love between Bella and Edward, which has been the core of this series, to focus on the mother- daughter relationship.  It felt like Edward, who is my favorite character, got lost in the back half of the story.  Why weren't there any father-daughter moments?  He was just there as the tool to explain what others were thinking.      Try again, Stephanie Meyer, try again.  Until then, I'll just stick with Twilight.
031606792X|2.0|SPOILERS:  Let me say that I loved Twilight. However, I was seriously perplexed with the direction of New Moon and Eclipse. Honestly there are so many other plots you can concern yourself with then making a love triangle and the various subplots it can proliferate. I really hated it and I was wondering how SM was going to resolve her love creation.     This book was about 3 books in one, and it showed. BD was a departure into a bit more adult situations, which is refeshing bc sometimes I was so frustrated with the sexual buildup in the previous books or tweeny situations. Of course SM builds us up again in BD, and the characters finally get to do it, but then thats it, fade to black. Almost as if she did write the whole scene, but then hacked off the middle gooey parts. Even though I know she can't go into the nuts and bolts of sex, the act can be described in a vague way but still thorough. Oh well.     I am a Vampire girl. I read Anne Rice, Laurel K Hamilton, encyclopedia of vampires, tons of stuff. There are things you do and things you don't do. Honestly, I was gettting more upset through the series bc these supernatural things were really beyond imagination and just plain senseless. It seemed SM just made up stuff as she went along, and then contradicted herself later on.     Bella pregnant? How? Where the hell did this come up before in the other books? So Edward's sperm was frozen for about 80 years till he decides to use it? Her plot devices were grossly oversimplified.     And, now Jake imprints on Reneesme (don't get me started on the name). Gee, SM wrapped that love triangle up like a bow. How did I know this was going to happen. Way to convenient and yes just a little strange.     But, in truth, BD had more action, and more character development, Bella does think about something besides Edward, Jake or herself. I was happy to see her in a motherly role and let's face it, the powers of her new found vampirism are logical.     All in all, it was a fittingconclusion to an ill-conceived series. She should shy away from series whether she does young adult or adult fiction.    I would have gone a completely different way, but alas Im not SM.
031606792X|1.0|I must admit that I was one of those screaming girls last night (early early early this morning!!!) who had to be one of the first in line to purchase (PRE-purchase!!) \\"Breaking Dawn\\".  I wish I had gone to bed instead!      Being a new fan of the \\"Twilight\\" series (and loving EVERY page of Twilight, New Moon (even the part--parts--during which I cried), and Eclipse), I cannot find the words to convey how truly disappointed I was in Breaking Dawn.

The book seems to retain only a little of Stephenie Meyer's voice--as if she was rushed by a deadline or some other force to complete this fourth installment.      Sadly, sadly for her fans....
0375424474|5.0|If you want to find out how you are similar to a jellyfish, read this book!  Its view of human embryonic development and our relationship to other species is lucid and fascinating.  The author is a paleontologist and anatomy professor who can really write.  This is a great read for anyone from teenagers to octagenarians.
B00005JPY0|5.0|By far this is the best comic book adapted film EVER plain and simple. When I thought that it couldnt get better then Batman Begins, I couldnt be more wrong. The only problem I had with the movie was the Rachel Dawes character played by Maggie Glynehall. They should have brought back Katie Holmes or they should have hired somebody a little better and younger looking then Maggie. This film is first rate Christopher Nolan has outdone himself again. If you really look closely at the film you will notice the paralell with our government. Sometimes as good guys you have to cross the lines just a little to get the bad guys. Remember the part when Bruce uses all the civillian cell phones as a giant sonar to locate the Joker? It reminds me of the Patriot Act that so many malcontent liberals are so against. I mean come on lets get real, most of us have no problem discussing in detail our personal lives so loud in front of other people in public locations with our cell phones, yet we are so worried about the government tapping terorist lines. If you are not a terrorist you should have nothing to worry about. The comparasions between Batman and President Bush are amazing. Batman has taken matters in his own hands by taking it to the criminals the same way Bush is taking it to the Terrorist, at the same time being villianized, despised, mocked and just about hated by the public. Sooner or later probably when he is dead we are going to give Bush our respect and gratitude for doing his best to keep us safe while sacrificing his public image and legacy. The same goes for Bruce Wayne. I hope the next installment of this franchise is even better yet. Johnny Depp can take over as the Joker and he can be as good if not better then Heath Ledger, remember the Joker is always in make up. They can make Depp look just like Heath, and Johnny will have no problem with the voice and persona. I hope they bring back the Penguin, Bob Hoskins will make a great Penguin. Dont you think? As soon as this movie comes out on DVD it will most definitely go into my collecion. I wish I can give it 10 stars because it is so deserving. GO WATCH IT if you havent already!!!!this movie comes out on DVD it will most definitely go into my collecion. I wish I can give it 10 stars because it is so deserving. GO WATCH IT if you havent already!!!!
0061438294|4.0|This book will definitely improve your performance if your job involves dealing with people. Gestures, expressions, posture and body language originate in the limbic system of your brain, responsible for emotions, and very hard to influence by the conscious brain. They are more accurate expression of thoughts and feelings; and learning to recognize those non-verbal cues is an essential requirement for reading people, which Mr. Navarro did as an FBI agent.    Obviously the best way to learn non-verbal body language is to work with a master like Mr. Navarro, which most people cannot. Next best would be a video. I have Paul Ekman's video CD on reading facial microexpressions and that is lot more useful.    Mr. Navarro really should have produced a video CD/DVD like that. This book has a lot of pictures of Mr. Navarro and his assistant demonstrating those facial expressions, gestures and postures, but they cannot demonstrate like a video, which is definitely worth more than thousand words describing the gestures. Therefore, I hope that Mr. Navarro comes out with a video version of this book.    The book is well written in simple easily understandable language with a fair number of pictures illustrating the body language that is being described.
031606792X|1.0|This book was a total waste of time. Stephenie Meyer was never that great of a writer, but something about how she told the story was always captivating. She lost all sense of that in this book.    *SPOILERS*  What horrified me was the idea of Bella having a baby. The power in Bella and Edward's love was the she was willing to sacrifice everything, having a child, leaving her parents etc. Although I never only saw her love as infatuation, I could deal with that.    However, Stephenie Meyer decided to give her a baby, making Bella's life a perfect one. This, for me, removes all sense of reality from the series.    And the ending that she gave Jacob? They boy deserved much better.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I just like to comment on one track - \\"You Were Always On My Mind\\"! Yes! This track has been on my mind when I first took this album home months ago. Again, when Buble was on tour in Sydney last month - the arrangement and delivery of this number LIVE (!) was - Intimate yet level-headed, Tender yet Passionate, Flawless and yet vulnerable. It presses my first tear-duct button during the concert :)      I was absolutely indifferent, if not dislikening, the original version of this song, which was a country ballad (doesn't press any of my buttons). Then Pet Shop Boys made it worst with a high-camp techno-disco treatment to it in the late 80's. I saw disco mirror balls spinning, boys (!) on the dance floor; more lust than intimacy and heart felt romance.  NEXT!    I believe I've learned a few muscial lessons from this track from Foster's confidently low-key arrangement and treatment of the song, and Buble's vocal delivery. (1) \\"Less is more\\" sometimes - The piano introduction, soft with a few notes in the higher registers sets the landscape of this romantic ballad. The slow strings, luxuriously warm double-bass, and the brush-drum kit made this a perfectly intimate encounter. (2) \\"Don't Rush, Tell the Story with you Heart\\" - I never get the stories and message of this song from the oringal and Pet Shop Boys' cover until this arrangement. Buble takes his time, word by word, phrase by phrase, telling the story. That IS the right tempo, the right heartbeat, when you are telling your love one that you really love him/her!  (3) \\"Vocally articulate the story line with texture and feel\\" - There is no need to yell, no vocal acrobatic of vibratos. Michael's voice is full of texture and shades, tenderly, restfully, regretfully....    Best version of this song I've ever heard.  Could be the last version.
0807262013|5.0|I was enraptured, I practically drove around just for an excuse to keep listening.  The theme of Lyra & Will's love is so beautiful, and so heartbreaking.  And I was deeply touched by Pullman's portrayal of death -- it happened that I was listening to this as my dad was dying, so I'm sure that lent poignancy to my experience.<br /><br />By the end of the story I was crying, even sobbing - could make for dangerous driving!<br /><br />My kids & wife & I listened to the first 2 books together and I continued to this one myself.  I'd read the books, but found the audiobooks to be far more compelling -- the story came alive, and the detail of the writing was so vivid (I guess I did a lot of \\"skimming\\" when i read the printed book).  Amazing cast, excellent acting, and the production is so well done - usually I find audiobooks with a \\"cast\\" to be slow, this flowed.<br /><br />I wish there was more!
031606792X|1.0|Let me just say that I always knew Stephenie was not a talented writer. This book pretty much confirmed it.     Jake and Edward bargain about having sex with Bella. Yeah, great. Edward, your wife is not a whore. Bargaining with sex is NOT something you should do. Jacob, you are an *** for giving into him against your better judgment. Learn to stick to your morals, dude.    In the meantime, Edward wants to kill his baby. Great. Yeah, it's killing Bella. THANKS TO YOU.    THEN we have Jacob imprint on said new born. Forget the fact that he was madly in love with Bella and made out with her. Forget the fact that Bella is the future grandmother of his children. Forget the fact that he'll be having sex with the daughter of the woman he originally was in love with. Yeah, being a pedophile is just great. And incest is even better. Jake was the only character worth a damn in the entire series-- he was the only decent one. And SM completely ruined his character. I don't know WHY she thought having him end up with Bella's daughter would make us happy. It's just a disgusting ending. The worst possible one she ever could have given him. And just the whole though of Nessie made me sick It was disturbing and so random. I absolutely couldn't stomach reading the parts with her.     OH and let's forget that Stephenie Meyer went against everything she set up in the first three books. The series was about her struggle to pick between two lives-- the human one, and the eternal one. She finally made her choice, and she STILL ended up with everything she wanted. So much for the supposed \\"sacrifice\\". It's not fair that she gets to keep Jacob-- she should never have gotten to keep Jacob.    All of SM's vampire rules were pretty much void in this book as well. She said that the vamps had no body fluid outside of their venom-- so where did Edward's little swimmers come from? The Easter Bunny? Eh?    There were plot holes like crazy.    There was barely a plot.    The characters acted, well,out of character. Bella was more annoying and didn't act like Bella, Edward was a little too aloof, Jacob went all psycho in Book 3 (he didn't act like Jacob at all), Rosalie all but disappeared (even though she'd been so important in Book 2), and there were just way too many new characters introduced.    AND, the writing sucked.
0679735259|3.0|The subject matter is definitely worth 270+ pages, but I agree with others who said that Herr talks endlessly but doesn't seem to get to the point.<br /><br />The first 80 pages are free associative.  Chapters 3 and 4 are the meat of the book and the ones worth reading, and I recommend you read those and let that be the end of it.  Towards the end he descends again into the free associative stuff.  I have nothing against that style, but Herr is not a gifted-enough writer to pull it off.  I think sometimes he thinks he's Joseph Heller.  He isn't.  And he isn't Joseph Conrad or Erich Remarque, either, though one gets the feeling he wants to be.  Herr is at his best when he does the straight forward, journalistic writing.<br /><br />Finally, do not mistake this book for non-fiction.  Herr has admitted that he has taken liberties with the truth with this book, so consider it \\"inspired by actual events.\\"
031606792X|3.0|I never thought I'd score a Stephenie Meyer book so low. I am a diehard Twilight fans, giving the book to all my friends like some sort Edward Cullen themed cult. My friends and I made shirts. We went to pick up the book at midnight. Getting that book was like Christmas coming early. Everything was so perfect. Where the hell did this all go wrong?    The story starts off well, and that's where at least half of the stars in my review come from. The wedding was perfect as was the honeymoon. But around chapter seven things go horribly wrong.     Bella pregnant. It goes against every rule in the Twilight Universe in my opinion. I was under the impression that by choosing Edward, Bella was giving up everything human just to be with the man she loved. She knew she would never have kids with Edward and that was one of the things she was loosing by picking him. I believed that sacrifice for true love was the theme of these books. So what was Stephenie thinking?  A I half expected to turn the page and see 'TRICKED YA! Here's the real story' instead of this silly fan fiction nonsense.  Bella's not supposed to have a baby. Ever. The end.    Instead, Twilight fans get the two things they hope for most (sex and a vampire Bella), only to have it all overshadowed by this mutant creature. Eliminating the baby from this book would have definitely raised my score to four stars.     So if Ms. Meyer ever happens across this review here is my message to her: I can live with having to read chapter after chapter in Jacob's head, I can live with there being no 'epic' Volturi battle, heck, I can even live with Charlie sort of knowing the truth about Bella, but I can't live with you altering the theme of these stories just so there's a nice happy ending. I had so many expectations for this book only to have them ripped to shreds. For me, the series will end when Bella and Edward go on their honeymoon, before any of this baby nonsense was started.
031606792X|5.0|I think the book is good, and maybe she wont publish midnight sun  because of how bad people are saying Breaking Dawn is.
B0018BF1KY|5.0|I just received this 5 cd set from Amazon and I love it! Five great albums with bonus tracks from the studio sessions which were left off because of time constraints. It's a whole lotta Rory beautifully remastered and at an incredible price. You can't go wrong.     One side note is that the slip case is very chunky and solid, so it feels like a real collector's piece. Nicely done.
031606792X|5.0|Within the first several chapters of Breaking Dawn, I knew something wasn't right.  Everything - the characters we had all come to adore, the plot elements - it just seemed off.  These weren't the people I fell in love with during the last 3 books.  Not to spoil the book for others, but the direction the book was going seemed so unreal and rushed.  It almost seemed too science-fiction.  I was upset.  I was disturbed.  I wanted so badly to love this book as much as the others, but I couldn't.  I put the book down for several hours and felt sick.      Then I picked it back up and kept reading.  Thank God I did.    The last third of the book is simply breathtaking.  I was mesmerized.  If you are struggling through the first part, I beg you to keep going.    I think we are so horrified by what is happening early in the book and how the characters react to the situation - that we forget we *should* be horrified!  Bella and Edward and Jake and everyone else finds themselves in a nightmare.  It's disgusting, it's disturbing  - it all seems hopeless.  Characters do and say irrational things in the face of chaos and ugliness.  Our favorite characters are not acting like themselves... just like we as readers are not reacting how we normally do during a \\"Twilight\\" novel.  It's nothing we were prepared for as readers - just like it's nothing the characters prepared for or imagined could happen.    I think the first 3 books are so focused on the romance, the love triangle, the forbidden love aspect - that we have lost touch about the truly magical and lovely world in which the Cullens reside.  In my opinion, the last third of Breaking Dawn brings everything (all the other books) together.      Think about all 4 books as one long story.  Don't you remember the spark, the mystical craziness when we first realized Edward was a vampire in Twilight??  How unreal and beautiful it sounded?  Well, Breaking Dawn brings back that magic a hundredfold - and now we experience being a vampirethrough Bella.  Being immortal.  Living that \\"happily ever after\\" dream we so longed for since the beginning of the series.    This is the kind of book that you read, think about for days, and should probably pick up and read again.      I will say, I think more mature readers will be able to appreciate this story fully.  I can understand why Stephenie Meyer thought a suggested reader age disclaimer was appropriate.      Don't get caught up in the stuff you hate at the beginning.  Keep reading.  Stephenie Meyer has done a brilliant job pulling us readers through some unexpected and ugly things so we can share the same feelings as the characters in those moments.  And in my opinion, it makes the moment of the \\"breaking dawn\\" in the book simply stunning!
0439813786|5.0|When I first picked up this book I knew I was holding something special. \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" is a story told not only through words, but also through a series of pictures (like watching an animated feature), but furthermore through the physical object of the book itself.     Mr. Selznick has created a one-of-a-kind entity that just so happens to fit on a library shelf, but that acts as so much more than a book. In general, authors tell their stories through words and filmmakers through pictures. Selznick has combined the two and come up with something that is more than just the sum of the parts.     I have a feeling we're going to see a slew of copy-cat books trying to replicate the magic that Selznick created in this \\"invention\\" of his, but my guess is that most of them will fall flat without the brilliant interplay of subject matter and form that comprise this masterpiece.    This is a book full of mystery and suspense, and keeps you rooting for Hugo and wanting to enter deeper into his world. It was truly a joy to turn each page, and as I closed the back cover, it left me with an immense smile of satisfaction on my face.    I highly recommend this as a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from younger children to teens and adults. A brilliant invention!

B001CZJKS0|1.0|On October 14th Anchor Bay/Starz Entertainment will release a Halloween 30th anniversary edition of the film.  I, for one, being a longtime Halloween enthusiast, haven't been this dissapointed since Rob Zombie got to cash in on and destroy this classic film with one of the worst renditions ever made.<br /><br />Again, and in typical Anchor Bay fashion, consumers are being offered the same Halloween product in a new package.  Look closely, every single DVD disc included in this set has been a prior release from Anchor Bay.<br /><br />Even the Blu-Ray disc has been out for months.  This is disgraceful and Halloween fans deserve better.<br /><br />The original Halloween was released thirty years ago, so why is Anchor Bay releasing Halloween 4 and 5 with this set?  They were filmed in the late 80's.  The answer is greed and laziness.  Anchor Bay is jumbling every Halloween release they've ever produced into one pathetic boxset in order to cash in yet again.<br /><br />This has to be the laziest attempt at a Halloween special edition ever.  Thirty years of triumph deserves so much better and this company is just slapping together a lame Halloween boxset at the last minute and calling it a thirty year editon.<br /><br />Even the Micael Myers mask included in this set is cheap and has been available for years at any local Spencer's gift shop.  It has no resemblance to the original mask what-so-ever.  Nothing in this boxset is worth spending money on.<br /><br />This was the perfect opportunity for Anchor Bay to release some of the \\"lost Halloween footage\\" found a few years ago burried in boxes.  All of John Carpenter's Halloween footage that was not used in the movie was found and Halloween fans have been long awaiting to see just a few frames from this holy grail of unused film stock.<br /><br />Will any of this footage be available on this boxset? Nope.  Just the same tired releases from a company that doesn't know how to show this classic film the proper respect it deserves.
B000002TQV|5.0|EVERY SONGS GREAT...then i jammed to it on me open chord tuned guitar which works good enough. more on review later perhaps.
031606792X|5.0|Well worth the wait (and staying up 'til 5:30 to finish!).  I was worried this last book couldn't adequately tie all the threads together.  But the story threads weren't just neatly tied, they were woven beautifully in unanticipated ways.  A great way to spend several hours in a thrilling tale.  As a side note, I liked how the intimacy (it was Edward and Bella's honeymoon after all!) was hinted at, but not at all explicit.  Sweet and sensual, yes.  Purple prose like a cheap bodice-ripper?  Not at all.  Just an amazing read and series overall.  Thank you, Stephenie Meyer!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|the 1st of their 3rd lp here to be discovered/accepted by u.s. . im overwhelmed to write anything for now-too many great things to say 'bout this lp/group. Goin across radiohead on the web; web gave muse as a similar like. I heard half a bar of the simple \\"apocalypse please\\" and then new this band was great-3 piece at that, since i used to play/write/study classical works in 70's of the chopin/beethoven/brahms, etc. type. Every song is good/different/original so far ive heard). Got their lp titled tour ticket rt. after/saw their kissimmee concert near here-greatshow. Of all their lps i have now, this is their best next to showbiz, origin.., & their 2006 lp which is just ok. Like all bands they have to change up for stylechange experience/newfans and $. Not to overdo it, i like this band-talented, cool, esp. in this age they started in, who kept classicrock goin-british rock rules forever. this lp does wear you out after a while with its many rhythum patterns and loudness.
B000084T18|5.0|1. Intro- This is standard for a 50 cd kicking it off with an intro. Not much you can say here gives you the hardcore feel to the cd thought.   2. What Up Gangsta- This is one of my favorite 50 cent hardcore songs. With the banging beat and the catchy lyrics fif brings it hard here. Nice Hook as well. Song Rating 8/10.   3. Patiently Waiting feat Eminem- Wow if em and fif ever killed one track the produced it was this one. If you heard the song the reup on ems last cd this is even better than that. Fifs lines are pretty good but buring the second verse em just killing it and the beat was banging as well. Great song. Song Rating 9.5/10.   4. Many Men- This is an interesting song. Fif usually brings it with more fast pace rapping but in this situation he slowed it down. The beat was slower but flowed well. The hooks and lyrics in this song were off the page but the beat could have been better. Song Rating 8.5/10.   5. In Da Club- Well this is a song that will be remembered 20 years from now. Fif absolutely found the best beat and may be regarded as the best beat ever. While the song was held short with 2 verses you don't notice it at all. What a great song and one you will never forget. Song Rating 10/10.   6. High All The Time- This was a decent song. You have heard this before from alot of rappers so it was not as impressive to m. Still a very solid song and should be worth checking out. Song Rating 7.5/10.   7. Heat- This was an average song by fif I was hoping he wasn't going to trail off but he got back on track the next song. I wasn't felling this a lot but it is not bad either. Song Rating 7/10.   8. If I Cant- Another one of my favorite 50 songs. You just fell the effort being put in here. The beat once again produced by dre was on par and while i wish it could have been longer i eill take this and its one of the more enjoyable songs on the cd. Song Rating 8.5/10.   9. Blood Hound feat Young Buck- This was a nice time to add anther guest to the cd. One thing about 50 is he usually doesn't have a lot of guest on his cds. This was nice it gave people a look at buck who had never heard him before not his best stuff but not bad either. Song Rating 7.5/10.   10. Back Down- More of a hardcore song here. I like this as fif brings back his street like style to the game which added a nice feel to the cd. Better than what up ganagsta. I was felling the hook and the song as a whole. Song Rating 8.5/10.   11. P.I.M.P.- This was another one of fifs hits. This did nothing for me. I mean nothing. Just the whole aspect of the song did not fit with me the beat is good the lyrics are bad though. I might be wrong but that's my opinion. Song Rating 4.5/10.   12. Like My Style feat Tony Yayo- This was nice to hear another guest on the cd. This is average back in the day I don't know if yayo was not motivated or what but I think he did a very average job on this song. He is a lot better now but one song I fell that could have been better. Song Rating 6.5/10.   13. Poor Lil Rich- This was not a bad song but I just wasn't felling it the first couple times ive listened to it. This grew on me by the fourth time I listened to it but its not one that I will remember forever.   14. 21 Questions feat Nate Dog- Fif brought it back for the ladies hear. Nate Dog was an interesting choice and as much as people hate on this song I felt this was a good spot for this song. We only had like one more song like this on the cd. Good spot and I approve of this song. Song Rating 8.5/10.   15. Don't Push Me Feat Llyod Banks and Eminem- If there could ever be a combination for a hardcore song it would be these three. This song was brought and while it was a little softer than what up gangster it sgtill delivered and kept me happy because we were almost at the end of the cd. Great song. Song Rating 9/10.   16. I gotta make it to heaven- this was a nice way to close the cd. Everyone always says 50 cent dosent have morals well he does show he believes in god and religion and I think this was a perfect place for this song to end the cd on a nice note. Song Rating 7.5/10.     Ok I will say this is one of my favorite cds of all time. I will end up going with a rating of 4.5/5 stars. The first 5 songs on this cd re fire and the cd is well rounded after that. Don't listen to people who say this is a 1 star cd. It doesn't make sense. I know I am going high but to me that's what I felt from this cd. 50 s fire and is here to stay.   It is not a 1 star cd that is just hate go cop this now
031606792X|5.0|I realize many fans are now saying Breaking Dawn was a complete bust but give Stephanie a break. Are you actually surprised by the story line? If you have started reading from Twilight then it shouldn't be a shock that Bella ends up marrying Edward having his baby and so forth. ITS A LOVE STORY! For Petes sake did you actually think the book was supposed to send a powerful meaning to all women and young teenagers about sex and pregnancy... They mentioned Romeo & Juliet a lot throughout the saga does it not occur to all of readers that are upset by the message sent that those teens KILLED THEMSELVES??? This is not a book based on responsibility and God forbid if Meyer wrote about Bella being on her own and choosing no one and going to college and doing good for herself... You would have all burned her alive for killing the perfect romance... I know I would have even though in reality it would have been smarter. Lets not forget if Bella ended up with Jacob... Team Edward which takes a majority of the fan base would have drowned her in a vast ocean of vinegar... She cannot please everyone so stop it already if  you loved the series then stop complaining! I loved Breaking Dawn just as much as I loved all the books... Its not about a message of inspiration its a love story in a fantasy world... P.s. Stephanie fore warned that shes a fan of happy endings as am I and I cant wait to see the movie.
B0007P3582|4.0|1. Intro- Nothing much hear just standard intro almost like get rich or die trying. It worked. No rating here.   2. In My Hood- Well this was an okay song nothing to hate about it but nothing to like about it either. It was just there and i was expecting 50 to come out firing like he did with get rich wit what up gangsta. Song Rating 5.5/10,   3. Thisis50- This is a song that you will like. One of my more favoirte songs on the cd with the catchy beat and a great hook by fif keeps the song rolling. Would have been nice to have a third verse here but this is an excpetional song. SOng Rating 8/10.   4. Im Supposed To Die Tonight- This song is a great hardcore song of fif. Not to many rappers are gangsat rappers anymore u got more chingys than u know what to deal wit. That being said this was a little to slow for me and would have liked him to pick up the speed. SOng Rating 6.5/10.   5. Piggy Bank- Just like eminem has a comedy song on all of his cds fif usually puts out a dis song and this was the one. I liked this better than laot of others. The beat was hot and some of the disses were good. I liked the end of the song were he shouts out to all da haters. Best line that fat Nigg* through lean back was in da club my shi* sold 11 mill his shi* was a dud. SOng Rating 7.5/10.   6. Gatman and Robin- This was another ok song i liked mroe than others. It had eminem in it which was nice to hear someone featured on this cd. Not alot to say about this song. SOng Rating 6/10.   7. Candy Shop- I dont understnad this for the longest time for like 12 weeks this was a #1 song everyone was bumpin this and now everyone puts this down. I have a different view up till this song we did not have a club sogn when this hit was fire. The beat is off the charts and its been so long that you can still jam to this in your car. I really like this song. Recomended. SOng Rating 9/10.   8. Outta Control- Ok we have here the original version of outta control and i fell this is the one that is better. I have always enjoyed song and the beat and fif hooks go wit it the lyrics are above par and one of the better songs on da cd. SOng Rating 8/10.   9. Get In My Car- This is an okay song. The beat was different as it felt like a radio song but a different beat than in da club and candyshop. I thought it was preatty good. Song Rating 7/10.   10. Ski Mask Way- One of the more hardcore songs on dis cd. Really underrated and is one of my favorties on this cd. We had started to move to much radio on this cd and bringing the beat to a sreet beat was the right choice. Song Rating 8.5/10.   11. A Blatimore Love Thing- This is not one of my favorite songs in fact probly the worst song on this cd. It did just not flow for me. This is one you can listed to at first but you need to skip it the next time around. SOng Rating 3/10.   12. Ryder Music- This was not one of my favorite songs either. Fif usually puts together solid song for the ladys and this one did nothing for me. It was even worse after a baltimore love thing. Skip this after the first time. SOng Rating 3/10.   13. Disco Inferno- Again the songs that get bashed by people today but were bu,ping a few years ago. i accualty like this better than just a lil bit. Another great club song. Trust me i aint about these songs usally but this was a solid radio song. SOng Rating 9/10.   14. Just A Lil Bit- This was another great fif song that gets bashed. If you like drer beats you got another hear. It was well spread out from candy shop and was a solid song to help the cd pick up its pace agin. Lyric wise nothing great but wit the beat it works and a great radio song. SOng Rating 8.5/10.   15. Guns COme Out- This was a hardcore song. Mostt of his hardcore songs I was feeling this one not as much. Nothing trash but nothing you will remember. Song Rating 5.5/10.   16. My Toy SOlider- Here we go this was a good song. A one were there was accualty a guest artist. Evryone will bash it because its tony yayo but he brought it on dissong. Nothing great to write about but a solid song wit ya out of the cell. SOng Rating 7/10.   17. Position Of Power- I was feeling this song a lot. The beat was catchy and the hook by fif was good as well. Just more of a hardcore fif song and flowed well with the soundtrack. Song Rating 7.5/10.   18. Build You Up- This was the song that fif missed the first couple time wit the ladies earlier in the cd. This was alot better. Like i said he usally delivers one song for the ladies this was a big improvment from the first two. Song Rating 8/10.   19. God Gave Me Style- I really thought this was interesting that fif put this on his cd. It was something i was not expecting.

SOng Rating 8/10.   20. So Amazing- This one was another lady song. I fell this could have ben left off but oliva kind of helped this song. Once again i fell this was a miss with the ladies. I was not felling this late in the cd. Song Rating 5.5/10.   21. I dont need em- I liked this song because fif was explaining how that he got to the top by himself. He was saying that no one really helped him get to were he was nice flow and good hooks. Song rating 7.5/10.   22. Hate It Or Love It- This was the song that closed the cd for me that brought the ratings up so much. Alot of g-units members were featured on this cd and it is still one of my favorite songs to dis day. So many good lyrics. One from young buck was let show you what a thug bought born to die i took the bullets outta 50 put em in my 45 shi* was sick. Great song. Song Rating 10/10.  Anyone that tells you this is a 1 star cd is hating everyone was on this cd back in the day. Is it perfectno is it get rich or die trying no but it is not a 1 star cd
0345501292|5.0|As a long time fan of the Indiana Jones series, this book is a real treasure to own. It goes through the whole film series from concept to reality and has great anecdotes from behind the scenes. Packed full of interesting behind the scenes photos and production notes etc. A must for any fan of Indiana Jones and film making in general.
0060934719|3.0|Much less dark than Gaiman's first full-novel, [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]], Stardust is essentially a satirical take on classic fairy tales.<br /><br />Starting in the village of Wall, which is seperated from the world of Fairie by a simple row of stacked stone, the young hero crosses into the fantastic and forbidden realm in search of a fallen star to give to his love.  Along the way he will learn the secret of his family history, encoutner creatures and people who seem to ahve stepped out of the imagination.<br /><br />I didn't like this book as much as I liked Neverwhere, but it moves along quickly and is a lot of fun. Perhaps its greatest flaw is that it never builds a head of momentum like Neverwhere does, so the ending comes rather abruptly, which, in retrospect, might be the point.  I highly recommend the [[ASIN:156389470X Stardust: Being A Romance Within the Realms of Faerie]], as images add a life to the prose that seems rather pedestrian compared to some of Gaiman's more epic works.
B000YENUI6|5.0|I think this movie is wonderful for those who love mob/mafia movies.  Vigo Mortensen was wonderful and completely believable (and nude).  I think that this movie is a little on the short side, I wish there was more detail in the end of it, but it really doesn't take away from the total impact of the movie.  I was really intrigued by the tension between Naomi Watts and Vigo Mortensen, they were truly electric together.  Overall great film, two thumbs up from me.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|I can still recall my youthful evenings watching television at home and my parents settling in to watch what appeared to be a too-cool-for-an-eight-year-old-kid-to-watch-show, Miami Vice. The television series ran for five seasons on NBC, from 1984-1989. But the action and drama of the show still sucked me in. Alongside favorites like Knight Rider, Riptide and The A-Team, Miami Vice seemed uber-cool, even if I spent a lot of the time confused about the more complex plots.    With nostalgia driving the way, it was only a matter of time that director Michael Mann revisited his creation. On July 28, 2006, fans got what they wanted when Miami Vice hit the big screen, 17 years after the original series left the airwaves, with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx as lead characters Crockett and Tubbs.    As long as I can remember, Michael Mann has always been one of my favorite producer-directors. The look and feel of his work is top notch, and this film is no exception. I almost forget about pacing and plot because the aesthetics of the film are so breathtaking. The visuals that made the original TV series innovative and provocative are ratcheted up in this film version, depicting a Miami bathed in sun drenched beauty and tanned with exotic locale and sweeping settings. Undercover vice cops Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs dress in the highest fashion, visit posh night clubs and drive exotic European sports cars.    While Mann sought to reinvent Miami Vice with the film, many of these traits are in direct homage to the original television series, updated and remixed with mid-2000s sensibilities.    The film itself is an intricate look inside a complex sting operation, where Crockett and Tubbs must go deep undercover to track down and bring to justice drug smuggling arms dealers who have killed three FBI agents and an informant. Simply put, it's a typical Miami Vice story, but told in such a complex manner that you really have to pay attention to make sure you don't miss anything.    The movie blends action with drama while showcasing Mann's excruciatingly detailed visual flair. As for the plot, critics reviews were mixed. However, many of the harsh reviews still praised the film as worthy entertainment.    This film updates a classic television franchise with a glossy, action-filled feature that packs enough wallop to satisfy casual fans with a hunger for complex, dramatic crime tales. This one ranks as one of my favorite crime dramas and you need not be a fan of the original TV series to watch and enjoy the film. Miami Vice would eventually gross $136 million at the box office.    (I originally posted this review at my website: jasonhink.com)
B000A59PMO|5.0|Seriously, you need to buy this.  Clever, witty, funny and, sometimes, sad and a little disturbing.  I'd describe it as \\"colourful\\" noir.  Great story arcs, well developed characters...and Kristen Bell.  I love it so much I teach a whole unit on it at Y10!  Seriously, you need to buy this.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|ok, seriously. i'd been waiting awhile to get the chance to watch this one... seemed like it would be a big commitment. ...and it was. this is craziness. the soundtrack/score barrows against itself brilliantly with a vibe that reminded me of \\"the shinning\\".  with imagery, production,  and probably the best actor around on the case, this is a slam dunk. absolute brilliance. the metaphors are thick and show the ironic fight between diluted religeon and money/greed/obsession. i imagine most reviewers that stated this is film is boring are too checked out to understand the intensities and craziness to their human condition and are probably the types to mail it in (their lives). daniel day lewis got the big award for this performance and rightfully so. the rest of the cast holds up their end flawlessly as well. see this...it will blow your hair back.
031606792X|1.0|What was this woman thinking? Was she smoking something while writing this? Or did someone hold her at gunpoint while she wrote this? This was horrible. Completely off the wall and doesn't even make sense even though it's fantasy. DON'T READ IT! Borrow it from someone if you really want to read it.
031606792X|1.0|I am one of those people who enjoyed the first three books, but knew her writing needed work.    I had no idea it needed as much work as BD proves it does.     This is the worst book I have ever read in my life (though I've only read through p. 303 so far and read descriptions and quotes of what happens after that).    This book is full of deus ex machinas, telling instead of showing what happened to someone, the characters fall in and out of their established characterization, and to top it all of Bella sacrifices nothing and gets everything.    At the end of Eclipse, Bella chooses immortality with Edward over a life with children and college and career with Jacob. She even has a vision of having two children with Jacob, but she loves Edward more.    This book nullifies that decision's consequences by having Bella get pregnant and giving birth to a half-human/half-vampire girl named Renesmee Carlie (a combination of Rennee, Esme, Charlie, and Carlise).     Jacob imprints on Renesmee and gives her the nickname \\"Nessie.\\" He imprints on an infant. This is one of the deus ex machinas SMeyer uses to prevent her characters from actually getting through life with real conflict and maturation. Jacob hates the idea of imprinting because it takes away choice. But he imprints on the thing and will now probably never stop phasing into a werewolf and therefore never age and never die. She has turned Jacob, who represented life and all its changes, including death, into another immortal.     Bella also doesn't have any problems as a newborn vampire because she's the biggest Mary Sue, self-insert character to ever be published. She also saves the day with her power.    This book reads like SMeyer scoured fanfiction.net for plot points and cut and pasted it all together. SMeyer obviously wrote this with the thought in her teeny, tiny brain that she's writing what the fans want.    Lesson number one in writing, SMeyer, as Joss Whedon once said \\"Give your fans what they need, not what [you think] they want.\\"    If this is the real Breaking Dawn, I'd like to know what the parody you wrote your publisher is like, because the only reason to read BD is to make fun of it.     SMeyer is a coward and a cop-out. I prefer authors who aren't afraid to put their characters through actual pain and give them real consequences to their decisions.    The title of the last chapter is \\"The Happily Ever After.\\"    I think SMeyer forgot she was writing about vampires and werewolves instead of Prince Charming and fairies.     To quote Jacob, \\"I wanted to somehow pour bleach inside my head and let it fry my brain.\\"    DON'T BUY IT.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|One of the great things about the modern-day Doctor Who is how, each season, the episodes build off each other to help create truly epic and rewarding finales.  This has never been more true than in the 4th season of this fantastic series.<br /><br />This year, the Doctor takes on his third human companion, Donna Noble, who actually appeared in the season 3 premiere.  While it's a rocky start for the pair--Donna lacks Rose Tyler's sense of wonder or Martha Jones's intelligent wit--she proves to fill the role admirably.  Among their adventures: A meeting with Agatha Christie, a history-bending visit to ancient Pompeii, and the threat of foes both old and new.<br /><br />But (SPOILERS AHEAD) the real treat of season four is the welcome (albiet somewhat brief) return of Billie Piper as Rose Tyler.  And not just Rose, but ALL of the Doctor's recent companions, plus [[ASIN:B000VWE5OY Torchwood - The Complete First Season]]'s Capt. Jack and classic WHO companion Sarah Jane Smith ([[ASIN:B001993YCM The Sarah Jane Adventures - The Complete First Season]]) are along for the 3-part season finale.  I don't think it's a stretch to call the extended finale \\"Journey's End\\" the crowning achievement of the Doctor Who revival series.<br /><br />Personally, I think season 1 and 2 are still the best, but the 4th season continues the journey with intelligence, humour and more than a few surprises.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am not new to working out, but wanted something to shake up my routine. This has been great.  I work full-time and have 3 young kids.  So I need an efficient work out either early in the morning or late at night.  I've worked out with various exercise routines for the past 20 years -- with and without private trainers; with and without home video routines; in and out of the gym.  I've completed several century rides and mini-triathalons, and I've done countless 5Ks.  I'm no pro - but I'm no beginner either.  I found all 3 levels challenging.  If it's too easy -- increase the size of the weights your using and jump higher.  If it's too hard, decrease the size of the weights and jump lower.  It's fast enough that there's no excuse not to do it -- even if it is late in the evening.  And just when you think you can't do anymore, it's over! It also takes up very little space  -- so when traveling I was still able to do it in my \\"European-style\\" hotel room.

B00008CLOA|5.0|1973, I was all of 13. This was, in my pre-driver's license days, the only way for me to travel. \\"Dark Side of The Moon,\\" a big old pair of Koss headphones, and a relatively cheap but OK stereo. Dark room. Posters. Dreams of escaping. Desires of being an astronaut. Wanting to be a pop star. And then this.<br /><br />Even today, over 30 years later, \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" remains a sonic marvel. When you imagine that this was done well before the advent of digital recording, samples and the like, it becomes all the more impressive. Instruments dart in and out, effects (the clocks, the cash register) flood your head and room with sculpted sound and psychedelics. The wailing voice on \\"Great Gig in The Sky\\" (Clare Torry) is downright otherworldly, as are the snippets of conversation that pop up at intervals throughout. The album unfolds in the best conceptual album sense, as nothing here explodes as much as it does infiltrates. It's one of those albums where it's well nigh impossible to listen to it in segments, the cross of songs into each other demands that you take it as a whole.<br /><br />To this day, \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" is probably the best known Pink Floyd album, coming along with that masterpiece of dysfunction, [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]]. In many respects they're very much alike. On this, the band was still trying to make sense of Syd Barret's descent into madness (as they did again on [[ASIN:B000024D4S Wish You Were Here]]), on \\"The Wall\\" they looks at the crush of success and how it almost drove Roger Waters over the edge. In the case of \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" and its long and pristine sculpted sound (courtesy of a young [[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 Alan Parsons]]), they captured their moment, and over 30 years later, it still stands like a towering achievement.
B0017MO10U|5.0|If you were as disappointed with \\"Ark of Truth\\" as I was, you'll be very happy with \\"Continuum.\\"  This is classic SG-1, impossible odds, the team working together, and a satisfying conclusion.  This is a balanced story between the characters (although Vala gets short-changed again), and not the Cameron Mitchell love-fest AOT was.  The special effects were stellar, the score is phenomenal, although at times too loud to hear the characters lines.  If this is what future Stargate movies will be like, sign me up to pre-order right now.    Edited Dec. 29, 2009:  The score wasn't too loud to hear the voices, my stereo settings were messed up and I wasn't getting an even sound.
B000OYC3J8|3.0|For me, the White Stripes can do no wrong. And while they didn't do wrong with Icky Thump, they didn't do their best either. If I had to choose a couple cuts to recommend, I'd pick \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" and \\"Effect and Cause.\\"
B000002I8D|5.0|FACE VALUE, the debut solo CD by Phil Collins, is also his best as a solo artist. The recording sessions for this album coincided with discord in his first marriage, and the song \\"In The Air Tonight\\", with its line \\"If you told me you were drowning/I would not lend a hand\\" fits perfectly with that situation. This CD is a must-own for any Genesis.

0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves is, arguably, Danielewski's greatest and most defining work to date.  It is hard to sum up what HoL (as it is known to many fans) is, but it is most definitely not the typical book.    The premise of Danielewski's work is that a young man, Johnny Truant, finds an unpublished manuscript analyzing a film, that does not exist, about a house which exhibits preternatural phenomena.  But that is about where the concrete facts of the work end, and even those facts are up for debate.  Danielewski structured his work, and characters, in such a way that readers now theorize that Johnny was a child from the nonexistent film, that Johnny's mother was actually the man whom he recovered the manuscript from, that the house was actually a being that made the story up, and a whole host of other ideas that will not make sense until you read the work.    Though this work is unconventional and very long it is quite worth the investment of time and money.  It goes places where few works are able to go and exists almost in its own genre.  Many describe this work as a horror, yet it does not fit the typical requirements for a horror novel.  It is, most definitely horrifying though, and many readers have experienced minor obsessions and strange feelings (such as unease in the dark, finding references to the book in day-to-day life, and nightmares) while reading the book; it is this which makes the book fall within the horror genre.  Yet the book has also inspired many people, such as one user of the fan forum who based her PhD thesis on Danielewski's works.  When it comes down to it, I strongly recommend this book.  Though it may, at times, be uncomfortable to read, it also brings forward thoughts and fears, it can begin a revealing process of self-analysis and understanding; but most importantly it can, and will, change you, and so few books can claim that.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Very powerful CD ..extraordinary songwriting that seduces and rocks.  She has the talent of a Nashville star combined with the energy of a Seattle rocker.  This CD is sure to  blow you away .. the same as it did me.  She's the genuine article ..!
031606792X|5.0|Many people gave this a bad review, but if you like resolutions, this book will provide just that. The tenor of the story is very different from the first three books but what did you expect to happen? Life had to move beyond Forks and its' version of normalacy sometime.

0385340567|1.0|I am a huge Jack Reacher fan, but have noticed over the years that Lee Child is introducing left leaning politics into his books. This last one was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Jack Reacher, former MP officer, sympathizing with deserters?  WTF?    Shame on you Lee Child.  You had me with your first Jack Reacher novel.  Now, I'm gun shy and won't be buying your hard back books without first waiting to see what other leftist politics you shoved onto Jack.    I'll be selling this hard back.    Shame!
B000YJ54DU|1.0|I've enjoyed most of the Reacher books, although giving PETA legitimacy in the last book was pretty ridiculous.  But this one was so much worse, for so many reasons:  anti-military but not honest about it; sanctimonious anti-Iraq war stance; and the pre-requisite right-wing conservative religious nut who wants to end the world.  Give me a break!  I could go on, but it's not worth my time.  I'm glad I got it out of the library and didn't waste any money on it.  Not sure I'll ever read any more of them.  By the way, I tried to give this a no star review, but was unable to post without giving at least one.  It's the only reason I did.
0739367676|1.0|First of all, how could this book be written by the same author we all came to know and love in the first 3 books? Second of all, how could her editor, her friends and family, and anyone else who read this book before it was published ENCOURAGE this disaster?     I was up until 6 in the morning reading this book hoping and praying that somewhere it would say \\"just Kidding...now here's the real book\\" or \\"and then Bella woke up from that horrible nightmare\\".      Did Meyer not realize that the relationship between Edward and Bella was the reason for the success of the first three books? There was no hint of that relationship anywhere in the book.    The Jacob imprinting sub-plot? I didn't think that Meyer would cop-out like that.  I thought he'd find someone that would help him learn to live without Bella (and the whole first half of the book things seemed to be going in that direction-Leah could help him get over Bella, and he could help her get over Sam, Meyer isn't a cop out-win, win, win!).      Most importantly, this series was supposed to be written for young adults (and judging by the release party I attended last night, that is a stretch, I took my middle-school aged sister and her friend and that seemed to be the main age group in attendance).  Young adults can sympathize with first love.  The love between a mother and a child? Leave that to the Lifetime Original Movies.       If you haven't already, do NOT read.  Convince yourself that the series ended with Eclipse, and let your imagination run wild for what happens next (for it won't run any wilder than Meyers).  And let's have a moment of silence for a short but brillant writing career that will never fully recover.
031606792X|2.0|I loved the first three books.  Loved them.  I won't recreate the book for you again, but it's incredibly disappointing that Meyers opted to ignore her own rules and create this novel.  She definitely wrapped the series up with a bow- with all the eagerness for the novel, there was a huge letdown after reading it... almost like Christmas: you look forward to it and then once the presents are opened, the anticipation is just gone.
031606792X|1.0|To say this was major disappointment is the honest truth. It starts off great but after about 150 pages goes down hill from there.     The story of Bella and Edward needed finishing and this book did that. But the story itself and the way it was delivered was not in the same league as the first three books.     The novel starts off excellent - the first 150 pages was incredible. Then is all went downhill from there. The ending was satisfactory; there will not be too many complaints about that. But there is about 600 pages to get from the beginning to the end and its a tough 600 pages to read.     When I re-read the series, I will definitely read the first three books and the first 150 pages of this book and stop with that.
B0000025KI|4.0|Let's talk about double albums for a moment. The most popular comment from fans and critics alike is that a magnificent single album could have been created by the careful culling of the weaker tracks. Now, this is, of course, true of nearly all doubles. There will be the weaker half and then there will be the remaining \\"better\\" tunes. Naturally, unless all songs are necessary to the whole - Tommy, The Wall - the resulting and shorter album would be superior. This is only logical, isn't it? The problem is that you may think less of a track that I find particularly strong! Thus, in most cases, discussion of whether or not a double could have been a stronger single leads us nowhere.<br /><br />I bought The River as soon as it was released. I must admit that although I have always had positive thoughts about the album I really haven't played it very often. As I listen to it a today I have the answer to the puzzle - there are a number of songs that don't appeal to me at all. They are the straight ahead rockers like Two Hearts, Sherry Darling, and Crush on You (yech) and You Can Look. For me these are not up to Springsteen's unusually high standards. I find them boring and uninspired. They interfere with the flow horribly. We have a couple of typically first rate Springsteen songs such as Independence Day and Hungary Heart followed by dreck. One reviewer noted that he recognized in this album the music that influenced Bon Jovi. This says it all! Brucie was heading down a commercial road and I wasn't aboard the bus.<br /><br />So how do you evaluate such a piece of work? I could certainly create what would be for me a great single LP from the two discs. In fact, I could produce a pretty long (50 to 60 minutes) high quality single cd. Without doubt this would be a five star effort. Throw in the rockers and I guess that I have to deduct one star.
0060005696|2.0|The author's point is that having too many choices doesn't improve life; and, in fact, it can even be detrimental.  It takes extra energy and thought to choose from among the dizzying array of choices that surround us; but that effort doesn't yield a corresponding increase in satisfaction with our choice and often yields _less_ satisfaction than if we had made a decision faster.  That's it.  That's the whole book.  A person could read the first two chapters, the last two chapters, skip the (largely repetitive and very pedantic) middle of the book and still get the basic take-away message.
B0000025D0|5.0|Although the sound is at times muddy/murky; it suits the subject matter. However, as others have commented, this cd screams out for a re-master. That is the only negative thing that I can say about Darkness. The material is uniformly top class. One great song follows another. As on all of his 1970's albums there are several instant classics - are there any better sing along car songs than Racing in the Street? Bruce rocks more than on the previous three albums and certainly more than he has since this was released in '78. Until I listened to this cd again recently I hadn't realized what an accomplished guitarist Springsteen is. Here, on a number of songs there are suitably controlled solos - searing but not overblown or showy.<br /><br />On this record Springsteen continues his history of spinning personalized stories of love, loss, failure, pain and unhappiness. This is angrier than Born to Run. The three earlier recordings really focused on what you might call Jersey life. This is universal in its scope - Darkness is all-American music about American subjects.<br /><br />Before I conclude I must, again, remark that the LP format of two 20 to 25 minute sides was the ideal. Sure it is great to have 80 minutes of songs on a greatest hits package. However, for music like this ten 4-5 minute songs are perfect. You can listen to the entire record at one sitting. There is no risk of boredom setting in with 30 minutes to go. As with the golf swing less is more! Logically this makes sense. If artists must fill an entire cd with music and release a cd every so many months then obviously there will be more \\"filler\\" than would be the case if they had to produce half as many songs in the same time period.
0670020745|4.0|Two years ago, I had surgery to remove a golf ball-size tumor from my brain. The months of therapy that followed were difficult and intense, but ultimately successful.  I wish I had this book then, for its encouragement, practicality, wisdom, and \\"I've been there,\\" message.  Reading it now has been meaningful nonetheless, and I could hardly put it down once I started it. I would recommend it to anyone who has suffered a brain injury--and anyone close to someone who has.
031606792X|1.0|So just like, oh i don't know around 5 million other people i woke up today and drove to the store to buy my copy of breaking dawn but then i started reading. Now don't get me wrong i love twilight and the other books but this book lacked so much. Stephanie doesn't describe anything, it seems like she is just trying to get it over with. I don't know why someone at the publishing company didn't stop her and tell her to mention little details like she used to(what people are wearing, what they look like, ex) i made it threw half way before i had to put it down. what kind of 18 year old girl wants to get pregnant and would want to read about it? Shes writing as the 30 something mom she is and not the 18 year old Bella is. Edward never tells Bella his excuse for the shredded pillows or the whole conversation he had with the cleaning lady. I don't think her character would let that go. i don't know it just seems like Stephanie Meyer got so carried away with what she wanted to happen and forgot that about the characters. My advice would be for her to just start a new 4th book with no half vampire babies.
031606792X|2.0|No offense to stephenie meyer, i love her other books to death, but this one has nothing to do with the series. The sci-fi twist threw off the whole feeling of the book, what once used to evoke a desire for passion and reminiscing about first loves now leaves the reader completley pissed off. It feels like a fanfiction prototype instead of the series that we love. We request a rewrite! It feels like the publishers wrote the book instead of the brilliant authour. Where is the lust and the witty conversation, the depth of emotion? Everything you loved about the twilight series seems to have gone missing in the grand finale.
031606792X|1.0|I absolutely loved the first three books in the Twilight series. They were romantic, exciting and original. I have read and re-read them. The final installment however, leaves alot to be desired. Even in a make-believe world, the twists and turns the author has taken are so pooly executed, that I could hardly tollerate them even with a great effort to suspend my disbelief. I wish that someone had been honest with S. Meyer when they read the drafts of her book. It's tough when the people around you lie to you just to keep you happy. They should have been honest with her and told her to go back to the drawing board. I really feel sad for her and the characters that I used to love. Although I remain a fan of the first three books, I will certainly be wary of purchasing any more of her books.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I thought \\"Citizen Kane\\" was well acted and well written and produced.  It is a glimpse into the life of \\"a big American\\", as Thompson's boss Rawlston pointed out, but ultimately it is a story of how consumed we can become by our own demons if we allow them to overtake us.  Kane could be seen as a hypocrite--championing the workingman and fighting for his interests, while at the same time employing the tactics of those he rails against (the rich, privileged, and powerful).  But at heart, he is just a man looking for love and acceptance (from friends, family--particularly his mother, who sent him away at 10 years of age--and the people).  And because it never works out for him, he takes his losses in the most personal way, until finally he is consumed by it and it takes its toll on him (symbolized by the Rosebud sled being consumed once and for all by the flames of the furnace).  Rosebud was, indeed, something he lost--his link to his childhood and it would forever have an impact on him.<br /><br />We had to watch this movie for an English class in college, and I've been intrigued by it ever since--perhaps because, deep down, there's a little Charlie Kane in all of us.
B000P0J024|5.0|Amazing collection of music at a great price. All the songs you'd want and then some!  The addition of the dvd is an added bonus.
031606792X|3.0|What's the major problem of this book that I was so eagerly anticipating/dreading? You got it. No sacrifice. What made Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings so powerful? The recognition that life is not always going to have a happy ending and that actions have consequences. So the pregnancy issue...Well, she was careful to emphasize that two vampires could not have a child and that Bella and Edward's relationship was unique. That means the whole \\"no pregnant vampire\\" rule doesn't really apply. However, while the whole self-destructive pregnancy was horrific, it was pitched from the \\"what the @%&* is she DOING?!?!\\" angle while in pre-imprint Jacob's POV. I was whole heartedly in the Edward/Jacob/Carlisle anti-monster child camp. That was the heart-wrenching moment of the book for me - when Jacob realizes that he's all alone because Edward has switched to being on the \\"thing\\"'s side. After that Meyer loses me.   She carefully set up the whole Quil imprinting on a two year old \\"let's not be weird about this\\" Eclipse storyline. What I was honestly expecting though was for Leah, the freakish outcast wolf to imprint with Bella's progeny. Nope. No angst or sacrifice necessary if Jacob imprints with the kid - Strike one. Does the whole Bella not going to college thing bother me? Honestly, as a grad student, not really. Because there are many people in the world who have no interest in college. Bella never seemed to be interested and only dangled one semester of willing Dartmouth attendance in front of Edward as coercion for sex. Do I think this is going to scar legions of teenage girls? No. Does the idea of Bella skipping the baby-vamp symptoms of bloodlust bother me? Again, not really, because the thought had already been circling my mind for the last few books that Bella is a \\"special case\\". It does lead again to what DOES bother me and keeps this book from being  an epic tale of love and loss or good vs. evil. NO SACRIFICE. Let's start with her parents. Charlie should be dead. It's ridiculous to think the Volturi would come all that way to protect the only vamp rule of secrecy and not kill Charlie. He's a human that has been exposed to what they are. They would know that from seeing Edward's memories. For being as petty and antagonistic as their actions showed it makes no sense that this plot thread would not be dealt with. Then there's Renee. Where the heck is she?!?! Her daughter is so sick she's sent to the \\"CDC\\" and we get nothing? We're supposed to be content with Charlie knowing about Bella but not a whiff of resolution with Renee and vampire mom Bella? Or how about the pack? Who's running things, Sam or Jacob? THey're just magically all one happy family - Strike two.   Reneesme (I actually stopped reading and said aloud \\"this may be one of the worst name ideas I've ever seen\\")did slightly grow on me and the Nessie nickname gave me a chuckle for Bella's reaction. Meyer is obviously trying her hardest to give the people what they wanted. A whole legion of people, myself included, wanted her to marry Edward and become a vampire. Done. Lot's of people probably wanted her to somehow magically have a kid with Edward, though I wasn't really on board for that one. Done.   So here's the biggest downfall of the book: my hands were shaking as I read the last 50 pages just as they did for the final Harry Potter book. This was because I was under the misapprehension that SOMETHING would happen in the Volturi conflict. So much passed through my mind of which characters would make the sacrifice for Bella and Edward and their whole way of life. I was sure that I would be a sobbing wreck as Bella and Edward pulled a Lily and James as in Harry Potter - parents sacrificing themselves for their child or each other. I also never had a problem with Bella and Edward's co-dependent relationship. It's not healthy or normal, but hey, that's how I feel about my husband. And no, it's not rational. But there was no climax because there was no crisis. No battle, no sacrifice, no point to this book. As Homer Simpson said in an episode of The Simpsons \\"Well, isn't this just wrapped up in a neat little package\\" (or something close to that). And that's the problem. There's no depth because everything just ends and it's so. HORRIBLY. Happy. Strike Three    The end.    This is a low blow after I just finishing bashing this mediocre book finale - but there were also a crrrrazy number of typos. Will I read it again? Probably because I DO love this series. And I think Meyer has alot of talent as a writer. But, well...y'know....see the above.
0792839730|4.0|I am no movie critic.  The criteria I use to judge a movie is Do I like it?  The response for this movie is YES.  If you want descriptions of camera angles or photographic woners/failures then don't waste your time on this review.    Let me explain why this is a good movie and why I give it only four stars.  Pros:  Hollywood doesn't intrude too much, in fact hardly at all. Thankfully John Wayne is not here defeating the Germans single-handed.  This work, like the book, is fair in its characterizations of the forces involved and their humanity.  It certainly showed the character flaws of some of our great men.  Generals who are so involved in stealing glory from each other that a half-baked plan with poor preparation is put into effect so Montgomery can get to Berlin before Patton.  One thing hard to believe today is that a war thirsty leader would disregard intelligence because it doesn't fit his plan for making a battle.  Of course nothing like that would happen now, but it did then.  I found the long movie very interesting and even humorous at one point.  An officer asks his aide if his golf clubs are packed for the invasion.  Being assured that this is certainly done, the officer inquires after his dinner jacket.  Who needs to worry if the radios work when you have the necessary social amenities.  The con:  I had trouble keeping track always where we were and who was fighting.  Maybe the length of the movie was too much for my attention deficit resulting from commercial television.  Anyway this is a small fault.    This movie is one of my favorite anti-war movies.  It proves that war is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury and blood, and accomplishing nothing.
031606792X|5.0|I can see how people are horrified over this conclusion to a wonderful series. It feels very very different, at least for the first half of the book. I can see how younger readers and some die-hard fans will not like where the plot goes. If I read this book while in high school I might have hated it, due to the more adult (and sometimes grotesque) themes. I think Stephenie brought her characters to a greater maturity than I expected her to. She went for all the things I wanted to see happen, threw in some twists, and really let Bella come into her own. This is no teen angst drama anymore, kids! Thanks for not pulling any punches, Ms. Meyers.    If you have a set view of how you wanted this series to develop, don't read this book. If you have an open mind and are willing to be swept along with the prose, you'll probably enjoy it. It's quite an experience.
0345440900|5.0|If you are a first time mom, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!  It unlocked so many baby secrets for me, and made being a parent easier.  I have given this book to all my girlfriends at their showers.
B0012OVFHK|2.0|Although I enjoy piano versions of music, this album was just not the same for me as the original new age concept music.  Oldfield has commented in his autobiography that the insight which gave him his first two albums seems in some ways to have been lost forever, and for me there is simply nothing like the original versions of Tubular Bells and Hergest Ridge.
031606792X|1.0|In all fairness I tired to give this book a chance. I, like many other, did see some of the spoilers on the web and hoped that they were either a joke or that they would be explained better within the context of the book. But I'm afraid not.     Breaking Dawn goes against everything that Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse set up in Meyer's series. The fact that Bella had to struggle, that she had to choose between Jacob and Edward, each representing two different lives that Bella could have, was part of what made the series compelling and interesting. But in Breaking Dawn all of those things that Bella had to give up, can can suddenly have back with hardly any effort at all.    Not only that but all of the rules of vampirism that Meyer sets up in her world become completely null and void in Breaking Dawn. Things that she had before stated were completely impossible just magically happen and without any real explanation.    Overall this book was a complete and total waste of my time and my money and I am greatly disappointed in Meyer for writing this, let alone publishing it, when I have seen better written pieces by some of her fans.
B00005JPSM|1.0|This movie is based on a german film named \\"Bella Martha\\" which is actually one of my favorite movies. I couldn't even get through this one because it was so horrible in comparison.    The plot is basically the same - a control obsessed chef is burdened with her dead sister's daughter, and a new hire is making the moves on her. The characters have a lot more depth, though, and the cinematography is perfect with the different moods of the movie. If you were tempted at all by the plot of \\"No Reservations\\" go rent \\"Bella Martha\\" instead. [[ASIN:B00007ELFA Mostly Martha]]
031606792X|1.0|The entire premise of the book is lame, cheesy, implausible, and ridiculously stupid. I too think SM should have stopped with Twilight. I hated New Moon, Eclipse was okay, but Breaking Dawn was a bunch of crap.    What is with fantasy authors lately? Why have publishers given them a pass on loopholes and plot holes and breaking the laws of the \\"world\\" they created? Even worse, why have we readers?      As far as character development goes, Bella degenerates into a Mary Sue, and it turns out Edward is a wuss.  This is not the place for spoilers, so I won't even touch on the absurdity of the plot.      The Twilight Saga turned out to be a huge joke on us. Meyer broke trust with her Twilight Saga fans with this one.    It *should have* ended with Twilight, after all.
031606792X|1.0|This book is just about as exciting as any other piece of fanfiction with typical Mary Sue's in it.  Because that is exactly what it is.  A \\"heroine\\" who gets everything they ever wanted,  even if it makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE whatsoever.  To be able to even accept most of what happens in this last book,  logic would have to be thrown RIGHT out of the window, and even then, it's hard to swallow. It undermines the relationship between Bella and Edward as well as undermining the wolves and their imprinting process.<br />To make matters worse, it throws the feminist movement back about a hundred years.  Instead of giving us an empowered, self sufficient heroine who knows exactly what she wants, we get this sniveling little girl who is only complete after throwing herself away, marrying rich and having a baby.  Do yourself a favour, borrow it from the library if you must, but don't buy this travesty.  Biggest literary fail of the century.
031606792X|2.0|I am not usually in the habit of writing reviews, but after reading so much passion and despair from fellow readers, I thought I would throw my two cents in.    First of all, I must commend Ms. Meyer on her bravery and skill as a storyteller.  She has an unmistakable talent and, as a fellow writer, I hope to one day publish and thrill readers with such raw and irrevocable emotion.  Her readers care so much.  Whether out of hate or love, you would think Bella, Edward, and Jacob were real people!    Ms. Meyer has done some things so right.  The beginning chapters were intensely beautiful and, in this day and age of instant gratification, sex within marriage is displayed with precious sanctity.  Bella says it best:  \\"How did people do this--swallow all their fears and trust someone so implicitly with every imperfection and fear they had--with less than the absolute commitment Edward had given me? If it weren't Edward out there, if I didn't know in every cell of my body that he loved me as much as I loved him--unconditionally and irrevocably and, to be honest, irrationally--I'd never be able to get up off this floor.\\"  If anyone ever demanded a reason to abstain until marriage, I would immediately direct them to page 83 of this book.  Bella could not have put it more perfectly.    I feel I can relate to Bella in some ways.  I was blessed with knowing who I was going to marry at age eighteen.  I wanted to marry at eighteen--I had found my Edward.  And yes ladies, he IS out there (and as a side note, I see nothing wrong with making your man work towards Edward's perfection.  If he is not willing to fly over the moon for the honor of entwining his fingers in yours, then it's not meant to be.  Be patient, and don't settle for second best).  We waited until we were twenty-one to marry, though, and I am surprised to see how much we matured in such a short time.  Marriage requires even more maturity, and to think Bella has a baby after seventeen days?    The concept of Renesmee is far-fetched and the baby's only the beginning! I imagine Ms. Meyer was in a lot of pain when writing the conclusion to her saga:  lack of sleep from tours, the stresses and strains of impending deadlines, and also the massive, burdening desire to make all of her fans happy.  Breaking Dawn was over the top, and I personally would have settled for something more bittersweet...what if Bella had decided to remain human (think Casablanca, Tuck Everlasting, The Amber Spyglass...the sacrifice of true love to do the right thing would have made this saga timeless)? I think many readers miss the Bella of the past three novels; I know I do.      We asked for a lofty order, and yes, I believe Ms. Meyer fell short, but that does not taint her past works.  Once things simmer down, I do not doubt she will continue to bless us with her talent.
031606792X|1.0|I should have stopped at 'Twilight' and just immagined my own happy ending for Bella and Edward. I've enjoyed the books less and less and now Ms. Meyer comes out with THIS? Was she surfing Fanfiction dot net or something? There must be at least 20 completed fics with the same premise.    How annoying, I was really looking foreward to a great conclusion to the series, especially since I was a late commer to the fandom. (I only started reading them at the beggining of May) But no, I get a 754 page fanfiction that reads nothing like 'Twilight'. Dissappointing to the extreme.    I really wish it would have turned out better...
B0017MO10U|5.0|This film is an excellent addition to the Stargate SG-1 franchise and may just qualify as one of its finest chapters.    Taking story elements and themes from pretty much every season of the show, Continuum chronicles the final chapter of the Goa'uld System Lords.     Sweeping, breath-taking cinematics shot on site in the Artic and compelling storyline aside, one thing that I was very pleased to see was the continued humanization of Claudia Blacks' character, Valla, as evident in one of the closing scenes of the film - hinting at the growth hinted at in the character during the Ark of Truth film.    This is a must have for any Stargate fan and I hope that it wont be the last SG-1 film made.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Who knew American history could be so exciting? This movie was excellent and I was sorry to see it end after 8 episodes. I have not read David Mccullough's book yet, but I definitely will. I hope HBO does many more historical dramas of this quality in the future!
B0017I1FNK|4.0|This album is gorgeous. Emmylou's voice is one-of-a-kind and gives me chills.  Her cover of \\"All That You Have is Your Soul\\" is my favorite song of the year so far. \\"Broken Man's Lament\\" is similarly wonderful. Give this CD a chance and let Emmylou take you away!
B000TEMS1Q|5.0|I have this song and also I have the CD. Of course this product is just one song, isn't it the price of each mp3 in Amazon? Well the song is excellent, good rhythm, great lyrics, astonishing mix. I'd give ten out of five if I could.
031606792X|1.0|I never expected this book to be good, but I never thought it would be this bad. I expected it to be fun, fluff--trashy. It was misery wrapped in despair rolled in broken glass and shoved down my throat by a talentless writer who broke many narrative promises she made to her readers and should never write another word unless it is on a bathroom wall in Guam.
B000W4D27C|5.0|Astounding albums like this one remind me of why I listen to metal in the first place. It's constantly shifting, yet always interesting. Play this album, especially the second half, to anyone who says metal is for dullards. Classical influences and instruments abound, including cello, violin, and viola.     On Precambrian, the Ocean have taken what Neurosis and Mastodon have done, but progressed it to a level I never thought was possible. The heaviest parts are crushingly heavy, and the more atmospheric pieces can leave you in a trance. Buy this album, and listen to it from beginning to end. Drop whatever you were doing before while listening to it, and just LISTEN.     Long live metal and THE OCEAN
B0019EXZY4|4.0|The fun thing about this movie is that it isn't a prototypical heist movie. The heist was pulled off by a bunch of low lifes who basically lucked out. There was planning, but there wasn't a mastermind planning every detail. They followed their plan, but in the end they were very lucky. Everybody (the police and bad guys) was just sort of blundering around just like real life.     Jason Statham is very good, but the movie isn't particularly about him. It is a good ensemble caste. The writing, the pacing and filming is all good. The nudity surprises me, but it does set up the rest of the plot. Another neat thing is the the twist is the bank heist team gets into hot water, not only with the cops, but with dirty cops, the government, and some really bad guys in a pornography ring. The movie keeps me at the edge of my seat for most of the time.     In summary, the movie was just plain fun.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not much of an avid exerciser and when I normally do a workout video it seems like I'm just starting to sweat a little by the time it ends. After doing the 20 minute level one workout on this dvd I was sweating buckets! I hate to sweat but it felt great- like I was finally doing something right! I have all the confidence in the world that this is what it takes (along with sensible eating) to lose weight. Jillian is a tough cookie on the Biggest Loser but she's also (in my opinion) the best personal trainer out there! I can feel body parts I didn't know I had right now! I highly recommend this dvd! Even for beginners like me (did I mention how infrequently I exercise? Bad I know!) who may have to do the modified moves, can get one heck of a work out! All I can say is buy it! Don't even think twice!!! This is one program that I will definitely stick with!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The scripts of this series were wonderfully written and the acting was incredible. Joss Whedon should be thanked for such an amazingly well done series, it's just a shame, even a sin that something this good can be limited to only one season. I just wish Fox-Net had more vision to allow a master to do his work uninterrupted - So thanks Joss,for your brilliance.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you like the Beatles, you love this movie. Great addition to any DVD collection.
0345451325|5.0|In the terms of a direct videogame adaptation that is hands down the best I have ever read and that's saying something I didn't think anything could beat the Warcraft books.  Its really great how the author fleshes out the personalities of each of the characters.  In spite of that the book reads fairly quickly.       Overall-I had never heard of this author before but he is very good.
B001AW9DKK|5.0|I must admit that i approached this album with a little hesitency through the track list and some of the  less flattering reviews.Listening to it was a pleasant suprise.I knew what to expect of both the politics and the music as i have a bootleg recording of one of the early dates on the tour.The sound on this recording is a lot clearer and crisper.As far as official releases go,i must say i enjoyed listening to this far more than either american dream,or looking forward.Both albums had their moments,but ultimately failed to realise the full potential of CSNY.CSN add an energy and urgency to the LWW songs which is missing from the neil young versions.They add that special touch to his music which lifts them to a magical listening experience.I would have liked them to release a cd/dvd of a full show,but this is a film soundtrack and delivers perfectly well within that scope.Long may CSNY continue to rock and speak out.There are rumours of other releases in the pipeline ie a 1974 tour release.Let\\"s hope they appear quickly.On the strength of this album,we have been deprived of new CSNY releases for far too long.
031606792X|1.0|after such a let down i won't be reccomending this saga to friends anymore or even bothering to defend meyer's writing. horrible, unbelievably bad fanfiction.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief is one of those children's books that has crossed over into the adult market and become subject to incredible word-of-mouth marketing. To be honest, I let it languish on my nightstand for 12 months, because I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype. I've read my fair share of books about the Holocaust and wasn't sure this one would tell me anything I didn't already know.     But the author, Markus Zusak, has created a wholly original story. First, the narrator is death, who talks in a kind of roundabout language, part all-knowing, part creepy, part loving.     And second, the main character is an ordinary German girl growing up in Nazi Germany who must confront many personal difficulties and traumas during the course of the Second World War. This is not so much a book about the extermination of the Jewish race under Nazi occupation, but the ways in which many Germans went about their ordinary lives at the time and the extraordinary lengths some of them went to save their Jewish friends.     The story begins with Liesel Meminger, a traumatised nine-year-old girl. It's 1939 and she has just witnessed the death and burial of her younger brother enroute to her new foster family in a town called Molching. During the burial Liesel picks up an object she finds in the snow -- The Gravediggers Handbook -- which sets up a lifelong love of books, even if she has to beg, borrow or steal them.     Her foster father, the kindly accordion-playing Hans Hubermann, teaches her how to read, and together the two of them pass many hours pouring over the pages of the gravedigger's instruction manual. Later, when the family takes in a Jewish man, Max Vanderburg, and hides him away in their basement, Leisel shares her love of words with him, too.     Desperate for new reading material, Liesel -- with the help of her blonde-headed friend Rudy -- rescues a book from a Nazi book-burning pile. Later she is introduced to an amazing private library, owned by the mayor's wife, which allows her to momentarily escape the dismal poverty of her ordinary day-to-day life.     But when the Nazis discover her foster father handing out bread to a march-through of Jews on their way to Dachau, their lives suddenly take on a more sinister, darker twist -- which no amount of book thievery can alleviate. When the Allied bombs begin to fall on their street, things get even worse and death begins to close in on Liesel, her family and friends...     The Book Thief is, without a doubt, an incredibly memorable story. The narrative voice is unique, and the style, which double-backs on itself and occasionally jumps backwards and forwards in time, is interesting if somewhat confusing at times (Would kids get this? I kept asking myself). Initially the staccato rhythm of Death's voice jarred, but I soon learnt to appreciate its whimsical charm. However, I enjoyed the story much more when Death kept his mouth shut and simply let Liesel get on with things.     The characters are great, too. Liesel starts off as a rather weak-willed creature, too terrified to even step out of the car when she first arrives at her foster family's home, but over the course of the war she turns into a feisty, courageous tom-boy, who isn't scared of tackling anyone who bullies her. And her best friend Rudy, who has an obsession with Olympic athlete Jesse James, is a suitable, dare I say lovable, ally.     I was not as convinced about the foster parents who seemed a little stereotyped -- the kindly, loving father; the foul-mouthed, bullish mother -- but I can understand that younger readers would enjoy the \\"good cop, bad cop\\" personalities.     The Book Thief is a deeply unsettling story and a truly moving one. I teared up over so many scenes that I couldn't bare to list them here for fear of running out of room! The ending is of the typical grab-your-tissues-and-sob-your-eyes-out ilk. But in reading this very long book -- perhaps a fraction too long, in my opinion (it meanders a lot in the middle) -- I never once thought I was being emotionally manipulated. Zusak does a nice line in letting actions speak louder than words, so that the reader gets to join the dots rather than have every little thing spelt out for them. I like this approach, if only because he treats the children to which this book is aimed with intelligence rather than patronising or speaking down to them.     A delightfully human book, haunting, wise and joyous by turn. I don't know why I waited so long to read it.
031606792X|3.0|After reading Breaking Dawn and discovering all of the spoilers are true, I'm disappointed. It's clear now that Twilight is the best book in the series and it all went kind of downhill from there. I sort of wish SMeyer would have quit writing the series after that. With every book the characters lost parts of their personality that I loved and by Breaking Dawn, they're so out of character and are doing things I never could have seen them doing in Twilight. I can't be too upset, however. I wanted two things from Breaking Dawn, and those two things happened. I've enjoyed the series, however angry the recent books made me, but for me, Twilight will be the only book I really love and I leave the rest of Bella and Edward's story to fanfiction.     If you want to read an amazing book by Smeyer, read The Host or Twilight. Those are by far her best books. If you'd like to read another series where the characters grow and experience real pain, grief, sorrow, and you love them more with each book, I'd recommend The Sister of the Traveling Pants. Unlike, the Twilight Saga, I've never been disappointed with any of these books.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawns theme/tone was a much darker one that its precedors. Although the book itself to me was a little out of character compared to the other three books, it was still very amusing to read. But the characters have grown since the first book and over the course of time their character/manerisms would have changed anyways.   The book itself was not bad. It was just different from the other books and people hate change / and being different. Meyer changed things and some people ended up hating it. But She did promise a happliy ever after for Bella and Edward and she gave it.
0061150142|5.0|The story was really good.  It was very deep and detailed.  The kind of story that you don't want to stop reading.  Jodi Picoult is a great writer and I am starting to read a third book by her.  I highly recommend her books and give this story five stars.

0385751532|5.0|I literally just finished reading this novel about ten minutes ago. I found myself just staring at the last page, waiting for some grand explanation to pop out and make it all better, but, of course, that did not happen.    This book is deep, and it really makes you think. What would you do in Bruno's situation? Though the vocabulary and style of writing makes it appear as a book for young readers, the topic is definitely of a different matter.
031606792X|1.0|I feel so angry and cheated. Breaking Dawn is a disgrace to the Twilight name. Stephenie- what happened?!!? Gah! The whole story is off- the characters become emotionless and shallow. I even was against Edward and rooting for Jake most of the book. Until he became compassionate to the mutant vampire-human thing that Bella gave birth to. After chapter 7 or 8 I began screaming at the book. 'What the heck!!!!' And when did Jasper became Jazz and Rose became- well completely insane?!!? The only charaters that retained some sort of their previous likability were Seth and Carlisle. Alice even lost it and disappeared for a huge chunk of the book!! I wish the book is a joke- but its not. Stop at chapter 7 if you havn't read it yet and imagine a new ending.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|stephanie meyer is obviously not an author that will be winning the nobel prize anytime soon, if ever. that being said, the twilight saga is one that sucks you in...the love story is a fluffy and cute one, if completely unrealistic and obsessive. still, this is a book i enjoyed.
0307386171|3.0|Author Ian McEwan has the skill of a masterful miniaturist.  With exquisite delicacy, his unblinking eye and steady hand can reveal a universe illustrated by an instant in time (a single day in \\"Saturday\\", a few hours in \\"On Chesil Beach\\"). This story is, on the face of it, a simple one of wedding night panic, but behind it lurk numerous knots of emotion and experience which McEwan slowly unravels. Here is writing at its finest.  Having said that, I was disappointed with the conclusion of \\"On Chesil Beach\\".   Perhaps it can be put down to a basic dissatisfaction with the novella form, but I found it all a bit too abrupt at the end.  The narrative proceeds at an almost elegaic pace through a huge build-up to a crisis, and suddenly it's all over.  With almost indecent haste, the last few pages \\"fast forward\\" to provide a tidy ending.     But this is a minor quibble about a couple of hours of sheer reading pleasure.
B00024Z914|3.0|This is my favourite 70's Jazz album. It loses 2 stars because of the price which is very steep, even for an import.<br /><br />However its a marvellous quartet of musicians, featuring Keith Jarrett on Piano and Jan Garbarek on Sax. A wide range of styles from the Gospel influenced \\"Long as Your...\\" to frankly undefineable (but brilliant) pieces like \\"The Windup\\". Spiral Dance is another stand-out track. The key thing about this album, is that it is an entirely accoustic album, made in an era when the trend in Jazz was for more electric fusion based bands.<br /><br />The musicianship is of the highest order, and the compositions are mostly written by Jarrett. Unless you're a die-hard dixieland/trad fan there will be something here for you.
0143113100|5.0|As a special education teacher this book has been an amazing eye-opener to helping anyone learn new skills, especially adults.  But teaching learning disabled students and otherwise impaired children brings a lot of insight into what this book is all about. I loved it and plan to reread it, taking notes as I go.  There is a lot that can be done, clearly, and we can never think that someone is limited in what he can learn.
031606792X|2.0|I'm upset that I went to get this book at midnight and stayed up all night reading it...    Kind of like with the Harry Potter series, things just went downhill. Eclipse was the perfect ending.    I could point things out and mock relentlessly... From the PG-13 version of a Harlequin novel the first 100 pages to the absurdity of Jake imprinting on \\"Nessie.\\"    But yeah. I'll stop there. I'm just so crushed I don't even want to continue... Haha.
B0001Z37HM|2.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger has been quoted as saying that \\"Red Sonja\\" is the worst movie he has ever been in, and has been known to punish his children by making them go to their rooms and watch it. I can see why. The film is good for a campy laugh, but it is essentially a lame follow up to the \\"Conan\\" films that were so popular. It is unsurprising to see that Dino De Laurentis was involved with making this film, as it has all his trademarks: grand scale, cheesy sets, terrible over-acting, and amazing plot contrivances.<br /><br />This is (surprise!) a film about vengeance set in a swords and sorcery background. Brigitte Nielsen is Red Sonja, a master warrior out to avenge her family's deaths. She is pitted against the evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) who has stolen the talisman. The talisman (which is a ridiculous glowing orb) will destroy the world in 13 days if Sonja can't recover it. Along the way we pick up the supremely annoying child actor Ernie Reyes, Jr. who plays the arrogant Prince Tarn, and the Prince's aid, Falkon (Paul Smith), who has the patience of Job to deal with the brat.<br /><br />There is much swordplay and padding, and many wacky characters and situations. I was especially amused by the giant purring tarantula that Gedren kept, and the metal \\"killing machine\\" that everyone gets to flop around with in a wet cave reminding me of Bela Lugosi dealing with the horrifying octopus in Ed Wood's masterwork \\"Bride of the Monster\\", the prime difference being that Lugosi could act.<br /><br />Obviously there is a wooden romance between Arnold and Sonja, but lots of swordplay is involved in the courtship process. There are numerous gaffes in this film. I swear that in one ambush scene the bad guys are wearing blue jeans...if they aren't they are certainly the ancient precursors. There are also some puerile ruses from Gedren's comically-costumed magician and an epic conclusion involving a mammoth sword fight, an earthquake, a river of lava, and an exploding castle (which looks more like an oil well fire than anything).<br /><br />This movie is worth the look for camp value alone: the acting is among the worst I have seen in a big budget film (especially from Nielsen and Reyes), the plot is ridiculous, the special effects are none to special, and characters are laughable. It is enjoyable from a \\"so bad it's good\\" perspective, and is relatively short, which helps deaden the pain. I recommend this movie to people who like camp classics.<br /><br />At least on this one issue, I find myself in agreement with Arnold Schwarzenegger.like an oil well fire than anything).

031606792X|5.0|Like many other people, I'm quite guilty of reading half of the book before it was released. And from start to finish, I loved it. I'm very thankful that she changed the tune of the book from a cookie cutter image to a more realistic dark one as the characters went through changes. With Bella becoming a vampire and all the drama the book had to offer, I actually commend her for having the guts to not skate over the very difficult and bloody parts of the book. Instead, she trusted us to actually be able to handle the gore and let us see the sacrifices Bella made to protect the ones she loved.  I think that some people may be giving the book low reviews because of the change in the tone of the book...and not many people like changes. While some people already made up their mind to hate the book before picking it up (probably because of the spoilers that were everywhere for the past few days), I read the book with an open mind; whatever happens, happens. For those who are afraid to read the book because they might find it disappointing, do what I did; act like you've never heard of any stupid spoilers and enjoy the book for the story it weaves as you turn the pages. I purchased the book around 12 midnight, and once I started reading it, I was unable to stop myself from dropping it until the story ended...which was about 7 am this morning :)  So please give the book a chance and you might actually love like I do.
031606792X|1.0|TRUST THE OTHER REVIEWS, THIS IS BAD. So bad, in fact, that I almost feel like crying. What the heck was Stephanie Meyer thinking when she wrote this?!?
031606792X|1.0|This book is awful and a complete mockery of the series.  I cannot believe Ms. Meyer wrote this as the final book in the series.  Really, how many fan fiction are there with similar plots?  Your worst nightmare comes true when Ms. Meyer makes the impossible happen - yes folks the spoilers are ALL true . . . and yes the name is \\"Nessie\\".  When I read this part I thought this was some kind of cruel joke  . . . but, it is not.<br /><br />Yes fans, we were all duped on this one.  I should have stopped reading at book 3 because some of the fan fiction stories have much better plots.<br /><br />Jacob narrates part of the story and you won't believe who he imprints on . .  .well maybe you will . . .<br /><br />I don't know if I should laugh or cry . . .<br /><br />All the other books are about choice and sacrifice, this book has a twist to it that leaves the reader thinking \\"what the hell just happened?\\"  I agree with another reviewer that said this book doesn't have anything to do with the characters or the other books and it ruins the series.<br /><br />This book is worse then the worse fan fiction - because it makes the worse fan fiction true!!!!!!!!!!!
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie both in the theater and on DVD.  I thought Natalie Portman can do diverse roles, and it really gives you a good sense of who Henry VIIth is, and the \\"madness\\" that affected him to who history claimed him to be in his later years.  All I can really say it was a well done film at its best.

B000062XE1|5.0|This BBC-produced version is a bit dry and stale for students used to MTV-style filming and pacing.  However, each production is very true to the original works.  The biography of Wilde is very valuable for helping students understand how his life influenced his work.  The most enjoyable production of The Importance of Being Earnest is the newish one staring Colin Firth and Rupert Everett.  It is based more on the original 4 act version of the play.  It is delightful, but the director took a bit too much artistic license by putting in some \\"funnies\\" that were anachronistic.  I recommend using both versions.  This collection includes his most important works including The Picture of Dorian Grey.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Okay, I have seen this movie 3 times, first time was at the midnight showing, the second two days after the opening, and the third just yesterday. All I can say is this movie gets alot better after every viewing! You catch things you probably didn't watching it the first time around. Heath Ledger IS The Joker, don't deny it, he truely did the psychotic role perfectly. I didn't sit there thinking \\"this is Heath Ledger as The Joker\\" I just thought \\"This is The Joker.\\" I can't even explain how great this movie is. Two-Face's face, looks so realistic,  the way the one eye move is really creepy! If you thought it was just alright the first time you saw it, think about it, go see it again, and most likely you'll realize how awesome it is. Alot of people that I talked to who weren't crazy about it were like that, but when they saw it again they liked it alot more.    Great, dark, epic tale. I love this movie lol.
0143038419|2.0|It was a perfect commute read. Went down easy but didn't sustain. Once I closed the cover, poof, it vanished, the literary equivalent of junk food. I was also perplexed that the author determined in Italy her only (apparently) source of pleasure would be food and that she did not take advantage of all the art, history, culture, architecture and music that are also there to be enjoyed. Often, I found her descriptions of eating and food kind of gluttonous. As a practitioner of yoga myself, I was surprised that she seemed to lean so heavily on her guru for insight and guidance. She mentioned nothing of learning to follow the \\"inner teacher\\" which is what yoga is supposed to help you do. If you come to the book with low or no expectations, you'll probably like it. If you come thinking you (or she) are going to have some earthshaking epiphanies, you'll be disappointed.

B0004Z33F0|5.0|Rambo III was a great deal better than Rambo II, but of course, not as good as First Blood. It's a great action picture and you'll never see Stallone as big as he was in this movie. He had to be taking Human Growth Hormone then. In some scenes it almost looks like there's a slight deformity in his face, which as I understand it, is one possible side effect of taking HGH. I remember when I was a kid, I saw this movie in the theater many times. The ultimate edition, unfortunately, sucked. For some reason I have yet to figure out, they added subtitles in many scenes where there were none in the theatrical version. The subtitles did nothing for the story and actually ruined most of the scenes because they were really dumb. They made this version almost unwatchable for me. So you might want to consider buying the special edition instead. The movie itself still holds up well over time and aside from some cheesey dialogue, is still fun to watch. Intensity, explosions, muscles, and my favorite....Rambo's exploding arrow tips....it's all here.

031606792X|1.0|ok, Twit-Fans are nothing more then pathetic teens and undersexed 40+ cougars who have no clue as to good literature.<br /><br /> Smeyers is the worst writer I have ever experienced. She took her story from the Southern Vampire series and is nothing more then a Hack. and the TV series ( Wolf Lake) as well as stealing bits and pieces from L.K Hamilton.<br /><br />The 4th Book was the most disgusting thing I have ever laid my hands on and should have never been printed for the YA section. Imprinting is nothing more then PEDEOPHILA. Jacob and the THING get to gether when she turns 7!! 7 people just because she had the body of a 21 year old does not give her the mentality of a 21 year old. she has still only lived 7 years and Jacob changing her diapers while Bella and eddie do it in the other room!!  and then giving her a promise bracelet at 2 months old!! WTF is wrong with you people!!The Author should be ashamed of herself
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I would have given it 4 1/2 stars except for disappointment over not having one of the best (all right it is one of my favorite's) not being included.  What happened to the wonderful song Knowing Me, Knowing You - which was in the original musical and I thought in the movie,too - btw in the movie Streep deserves an Oscar nomination (her \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" rendition is a masterful demonstration of just what this great actor can do - which is anything) and Brosnan gives it the old college try, as it were (God bless him for trying) - Skaasgard and Walters are great and well, Baranski tears up the screen - she is awesome!
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|The best (nearly) of the first-generation Star Trek movies.  Enjoyable except for the museum curator whose performance is terrible and the casting director should be ashamed.  Of course the best movie is \\"Khan\\", but this is the second-best.
031606792X|1.0|Like so many I was eagerly anticipating the release of Breaking Dawn, the fourth installment of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight saga. After attending a midnight release party. I got home and quickly tore the book open eagerly awaiting whatever the book would hold. However, after delving further into the book my excitement transformed into a combination of shock, horror and disgust.     THIS is what we were waiting for!??I kept waiting to find the page that said just kidding,but found nothing but a cruel joke! There were so many options available, and this is what she chose? Why? In a interview in Entertainment Weekly Meyers said she knew she wasn't going to make everyone happy, and we knew that fans of Jacob were going to  disappointed ( lets be honest he really never had a chance to win Bella's love). Instead of forever dividing us, I feel that she untied us in the total collapse of Breaking Dawn.  This was never meant to be a \\"happy ever after.  Even those who wanted Bella to choose Edward, wanted her to lose something in the process. (I.E. Her parents, her friends, her ability to have children.) The series as a whole was centered around this. The utter failure of Breaking Dawn is that it gives Bella Edward and it allows her to keep everything she was going to give up.    The general consensus among Twilight fans was that Jacob Black didn't deserve anything out of this. Yes, he did call the Cullen's names (which was immature.) However, through the course of the series he has been the one character who never truly wavered from his ideals. He shows this in Breaking Dawn by siding with the Cullens over his pack. Effectively setting aside his own nature for the good of Bella. As such, he deserved an appropriate ending to his story. What we get, however, is a creepy incestuous twist. Namely, Jacob imprinting on Bella and Edward's daughter.     How could anyone think this was a good idea? in order for Stephenie Meyer to get her happy ending he gets forced into the most disturbing romantic relationship this side of Hamlet.    The forced Happy Ending is this book's greatest flaw. I would have been able to stomach some of the book's more idiotic turns (of which there are many) if it stayed true to the central crux of the series. Namely, the complexities of romantic relationships and the impact of choice and consequences in life. Instead we have an utterly pointless coming-of-age story in which the only strong permeating theme is embracing a life of domesticity, and that true happiness comes through procreation and maternal devotion.    Like it or not, there have been many comparisons made between the Twilight saga and J.K. Rowling's masterful Harry Potter series. While both series have been enormously successful. the difference is that Rowling, unlike Meyer, has the ability to end  a series in a way that is true to the story that came before it.     In years to come, when i think of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I will think of the inspiring, epic and creative Odyssey that Rowling imparted on us. When I think of Breaking Dawn, I will only think of bad vampire seman jokes.    So, Ms. Meyer. I've read the works of J.K Rowling; and you madem, are no J.K Rowling.    Nor will you ever be.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This is a great album!  I think it is easily George's second best album and maybe even his very best.  It is hard to compare it to All Things Must Pass because it was a \\"classic\\" album of a different time period.  ATMP is great, but I don't listen to it repeatedly as I do \\"Brainwashed\\".  If you love George or The Beatles, you should already own this album (CD).  George was great and he left a wonderful gift for everyone.
B000056VJ7|5.0|If all this record had going for it was the viscous cheesiness of Jim Steinman's lyrics, Phil Rizzuto's play-by-play fellatrix or the groin-bruising operetics of Mr. Loaf, Bat Out Of Hell would still qualify as an honorable mention in any discussion of late `70s arena-rock machismo. Fortunately, it is BOOH's musical undercard that continues to make it much more than a time period oddity. Supporting this teenage passion play is the production and guitar genius of Todd Rundgren abetted by two of rock's finest ensembles - Rundgren's own musical alter-ego, Utopia (Kasim Sultan, Roger Powell) and a lend-lease from the E-Street Band in the persons of Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan.     Rundgren retains his laurels as the era's most prolific front-man and technical Svengali. Right in the middle of a production run that included Janis Joplin, Patti Smith, XTC, Badfinger and Grand Funk, Rundgren drove the sonics of his all-star line-up through a heavy metal atom smasher that all but renders the sticky-fingered story-line hopelessly dazed, utterly confused and completely beside the point. Bat Out Of Hell is Wagnerian overkill designed for the one speaker technics of a 1972 Plymouth Duster - overwhelming, overwrought, overweight and over-the-top with every ear drum shattered and woofer blown.     Meat's opus-dopus remains joyously catatonic in it's blissed-out ignorance and is easily the smartest, dumb recording ever made. Five stars for this essential classic.

B0017MO10U|5.0|Loved this second full-length feature about SG-1, with the huge bonus that Richard Dean Anderson is in it!  It's outstanding, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  As far as I'm concerned, they can keep these two-hour beauties coming.  Hope there is a third, a fourth, a fifth, and ? in the works.  Didn't realize how much I missed the series!  The whole cast is fabulous in this one, and I'm particularly partial to time-travel SF anyway. Surely Ben Browder must be considered for more SG-1 related shows -- either in movies or in a new series.  He's great, and so is Claudia Black, in this one.  See it.  You won't be disappointed in the least.  And, I refuse to pick any nits about it. Great flick!
031606792X|1.0|I think a lot of fans, die hards and those (like me) who just like to read a good book or series, woke up this morning thinking, \\"What was she thinking when she wrote this?\\"    I read the spoilers ahead of time and even though I found them highly amusing, a small part of me wanted them to be fake, even if I ended up with egg all over my face for it.     This review will not make fun of the name Nessie (even though I will stand by my thought that the Loch Ness Monster would not approve) nor will it focusing on Edward going a little to far to prevent Bella the pain of not having children. I think we all can understand why he approached Jacob and the desperation he felt.    The Twilight Series had everything: Powerful forbidden love, choices, sacrifices, and dynamic characters. So much could have been done with the final installment. Rather you were a Team Edward or a Team Jacob fan, you knew Bella would finally have to decide where her heart belonged and fully accept the consequences of her decisions: those good and bad.    I read so many fanfictions while waiting for this book released and I always skipped over the ones where Bella was pregnant because it was so unrealistic, not just because Edward was a vampire but because Bella has always been one of the most immature characters ever created (and I am a Bella fan).    She reminded us all older readers of the pain and greatness of first love. Granted, Bella took it a little too far before, ceasing to exist when Edward left and even resorting to dangerous activities for a delusion of his voice. This was NOT someone I ever wanted to be responsible for a child. She was a child herself. I could easily picture Bella in my head driving her truck with the kid in her lap or accidentally dropping her on her head. I guess its a good thing the child is half vampire. Having a child does not make you an adult or responsible; however as soon as Bella realized she was having one she went from wanting to be protected and cared forto wanting to be the protector. That doesn't happen like that. It's illogical.    Not only is Bella young, she's already married, begging for sex (which turns out to be the only reason shes willing to stay human- that's a good example of maturity), and once again, not even taking her health into consideration.     I am 28 and if I felt a baby kick for the first time, I would freak. I can't imagine what a real teenager would think if that happened. I doubt her first reactions would include joy. I would want my mother. I would be scared.    Bella? No, she calls Rosie.    Which brings me to Rosie. Did anyone else feel sorry for her? Here is this woman who all she wanted was to live and have a child now must endure watching someone have something she would have given her life up for. Nice.    I can't even complain about Jacob. He redeemed himself on some small level even though I never liked how he manipulated Bella into kissing him previous books. I always thought that was borderline sexual assault and really hoped young girls reading that wouldn't have seen that as an attractive quality.     I am not going to even touch on the creepy aspect of him imprinting on an infant but what blows my mind that he imprints on the child of the woman he so desperately loved. How can you even explain that. Its beyond unrealistic and somewhat disturbing. I can begin to imagine the stories Bella and Jacob will share with old Nessie.     Jacob- \\"I may have pictured your mom naked and pregnant with my child, but hey, you will do.\\"    I know Stephanie wanted to give everyone a happy ending but there was other ways. Phillip and Renee could have had a child and X amount of years later he could have imprinted. A new girl could have moved to town. Hey that would have at least allowed Stephanie to expand the series, and let's admit it, make more money. Instead, he ends up with the child of the woman he loves. That is twisted.    Bella gets everything, which isn't necessarily bad but she gets everything in the most disturbing and inappropriate way. I can not imagine any parent being okay with the message this book provides.    All you need is Men in your life, a baby, marriage, and a small cottage in the woods. No matter how young and irresponsible you are.    Many of Stephanie Meyer's fans will fail to see anything wrong, many of them are young and hung up on the ideal of the perfect Edward, the perfect Love without even acknowledging the message this is sending to them. Already we have enough teen pregnancies, babies having babies, and struggling to be both and parent and a child.    This book tells you that it's okay. Having children that young is Okay.    I have skimmed many of the reviews on Amazon, IMDB, and MISC websites and found that many of her fans think alike on this subject. Many of them saw the potential for a powerful message to be sent to the youth of tomorrow.    A powerful message was sent. A very wrong one.
031606792X|2.0|Now I have never written a review before, but after reading this...well I guess you can call it a book...I had to write something. I loved Twilight, and like New Moon, and really enjoyed Eclipse. So instead of being smart and making my own ending, I went to the bookstore at 12:01 am to get the final chapter and see how it all played out.     Instead, I was handed Breaking Dawn which after the first two hundred pages, I was convinced was a joke. I kept looking for the page somewhere in there that said 'gotcha, this isn't the real thing...come back and get the actual book.' Sadly, this didn't happen. I was just into the second part of the book where I was fighting the urge to give up and not even finish it. I didn't buy the book for Jacob's perspective, I wanted Bella's. But I stuck through just to see what Meyer was thinking...hoping should would reign in the insanity. The last part of the book had some (very few) echos of the other three books, but instead of getting to the point, she would drag out scenes for pages when it didn't need to be that way. I really had very high hopes for this book and I HOPE they do not make this one into a movie...I shudder at the thought.     I originally planned on only giving one star but the 'third' book kind of saved itself from completely drowning. It still only gets two stars though. Save yourself the 20 bucks and make up your own ending. Trust me, it will turn out much better than this.

Since starting the book, I have recommended it to everyone I know.  I have read a lot of the reviews posted here, and I honestly don't know how anyone could not like this book.  Seeing things from Enzo's perspective adds to the humor and the pain. I love getting this from him, and hearing it from his perspective because it makes it all more credible.  Yeah this stuff happens to people all the time, and people could write a book about it and it might get read, but to have it from the dog makes it different, more powerful, maybe more painful, more innocent.  I look at my dogs just a little differently now.  I have always known they are smart and they think, and they have feelings -- this book validates those feelings.  I love being able to lose myself in a book, in the characters and in their lives -- makes some of my problems seem a little less significant and more bearable.  I love reading a book whose characters stay with me long after I have finished the book.  THAT is a good book and a special gift that the author has.  I hope there will be many more books from Mr. Stein. I bought another copy for another friend yesterday, and am pretty sure I will have to continue buying to insure that all of my friends have this book on their nightstand.
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|This is a great disc by one of the premier rock bands today.As on the previous two the singer sounds awsome and the new guitarist is as well.Ive seen them live twice now and they do not disappoint!!!
B001BMKOZW|5.0|When I listened to Elect the dead by Serj Tankian, I was pleased. With this, I am amazed at the range of darons voice. A lot of stadium anthems here, along with the inherent sillyness of S.O.A.D. After this, I am starting to think that Daron WAS system, as this sounds much more like system than serges album.
B0063FGG22|5.0|A classic movie that I can watch again and again.  And the blu-ray edition is outstanding.  Makes it worthwhile to upgrade from DVD.
031606792X|5.0|This was a very good book and the perfect ending to the series. This book is kind of similar to the way the 7th Harry Potter book was to its series, meaning that the storyline is very different than the others because it is the end and the drama is not caused by a single evil force as in the others. They ran out of evil vampires to kill, what else were they supposed to do, nobody would have liked the book if it was too similar to the others because it wouldn't have been unique enough to end the series. Therefore it takes the book to a new level than the others in a way that fits perfectly. There would have been no other way to correctly end this series and I am very proud of Stephanie Meyer for sticking to this ending and for writing such an excellent and compelling series.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I have read a lot of negative reviews for this album, but just can't agree with them. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. While there are still similarities in the sound to Nickelback, who are a great band, I don't believe that they have made as solid a record as this one by TOAD. From song Crutch, which is a crushing rocker to Little Smirk, a sardonic and big F.U. to a cheating girlfriend, this cd has it all. And it must be said that Tyler's voice has never been stronger or clearer.
031606792X|2.0|Woah. I'm a HUGE Steph fan, but I can't help but think the pressure of this last book must have gotten to her. I was shocked, to say the least, of how graphic and grusome it got in some parts. That's all fine and dandy...just as long as it wasn't at the point in the book it was at...those of you who have read the book would know what I'm talking about.   I feel bad giving such a harsh reveiw of my favorite author, but I just feel that this last book was a let down. Kind of a sci-fi/fanfic thing. It didn't quite feel 100% Steph. Usually I am so drawn in by her every word and sentence, but there were definitely parts of Breaking Dawn I just skimmed.   I will say though, the 2nd half was MUCH better and more the way I expected the book to go...maybe minus Nessie...  But hey, if you like it, I'm glad, I just feel that there was quite a lot left to be improved on. I'm still a Stephenie Meyer and Twilight Saga fan despite the oddity of this last book.
B000YABYLA|2.0|Tends to glamorize teen pregnancy and make it seem \\"fun\\" and easy to get rid of.
0425188809|5.0|i am a horror movie fan. i love it and if you are a horror fan too, you'll love this book.  way better than the movie, watchers.
031606792X|3.0|Basically, this book does not compare in plot, content and intensity of emotions to the previous three.  I have been a huge fan of these books ever since \\"Twilight\\" first came out, and was so thrilled for the release of the 4th book. I think an important reason this series has been so popular is Meyer's amazing ability to draw in the reader, making him/her believe in the Cullens' world and care so much about the characters.  In this 4th book, however, the events somehow are not entirely believable, and appear ludicrous at times.  The plot line lags quite a bit in the beginning and middle with rambling, trivial concerns.  I have always been a fan of the prior books' intense battles, but they were surprisingly lacking in this conclusion.  I would have liked to read more action and less mindless stressing by Bella.  The climax is not nearly as action-packed as I would have liked, and pales in comparison to the exciting fights of the previous books. However, the plot eventually does creates sufficient momentum to hold your interest to the end of the book and leads the reader quite nicely to the ending.      Overall, I found it highly predictable yet still enjoyable in the way that any hardcore fan of a book would enjoy it -- just being able to read any new scenes with the Forks community (\\"real\\" scenes, conjured by Stephenie Meyer) suffices for me.  The beauty of Edward & Bella's bond is still beautiful as ever in this 4th book, which is what diehard fans are looking for, anyways.  Anyone who is obsessed with the books and the characters may find fault with the book but will soak it up eagerly and love it despite its flaws.
0743277708|5.0|This is my all-time favorite work of fiction. It works perfectly on so many different levels: an adventure fantasy, a cautionary tale about basic nature, a lesson on the meaning of true friendship and leadership. Only a few novels can you say actually changed your life, and I can see I am not alone in saying that it changed mine.     One encouraging word to the new reader: ease into the story, it reveals its charms and characters in due time. And before you know it, you'll wish it were 400 pages longer! Watership Down is truly one for the ages.
031606792X|1.0|I'm very disappointed and a little confused about the whole story.    SPOILER ALERT!    The whole Bella has a baby plot twist made me felt let down by the rules that were set for the whole Twilight vampire world.  Plus, it meant something (at least to me) that Bella was giving up having a baby because of her love for Edward.  And then--the Jacob imprint stuff is just too creepy.  I thought the imprint stuff with Quill was creepy, too, but this was just too much.    The fact that no one in the story had to give up anything to get everything they wanted belittled the whole story--and somehow that made me feel cheated or dumb for having bought into the characters and the story to begin with.  I love The Lord of the Rings saga--the books and to my surprise, the movies as well.  And in those stories, the characters have to give up things/people they care about to achieve the greater good or to carry on and reach their goals.      While I guess getting everything you want and paying no price for it might be everyone's dream, it doesn't seem worthwhile or noble or--some other great quality I can't describe.  It just seems cheap.    I watched an interview with Mrs. Meyer about Breaking Dawn and she said that it was modeled after Midsummer Night's Dream and another book she wouldn't name.  Now I really wonder what the other book was.    I really looked forward to reading this book and I'm not sorry I read it, but I am disappointed.  And, I'm afraid it's changed my whole view of the Twilight series.
0767821629|4.0|The underlying premise is simple: HOW do we know we are real, or WHAT precisely IS reality? This movie can't answer that and after careful consideration it is obvious that NO ONE can. The safest thing to do is to fall back on Descartes' \\"I think, therefore I am\\". The alternative is lose oneself in a lifelong search for truth or possibly getting trapped in an endless loop of thought.    Although there are better movies (even sci-fi movies) to watch this one is highly entertaining and well worth seeing more than once. My personal preference is in WIDESCREEN format.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I doubt that I can say anything that hasn't been said in the hundreds of other reviews, but I wanted to add my voice to the choir since this is one of my all-time favorite albums. When it first came out I saw it in a store and bought it immediately, even though I hadn't been aware that he had a new album out. Beck's just the kind of artist I feel comfortable buying from without hearing a sample first, reading any reviews, etc.    When I put the CD on in my car I had the windows down and the traffic was loud and I really couldn't hear it very well. I was surprised that it was an acoustic album and all of the songs sounded the same in that environment. Still, I was sure that they would distinguish themselves after a few careful listenings.    Surely enough, Sea Change stayed in my CD player for almost a month straight and I listened to it as many as 8 times a day while I worked on a really difficult project for my Distributed Operating Systems class. I remember working so hard to meet that deadline and being so appreciative that I had found a landmark album like Sea Change right at the perfect time.    Now that grad school is over and life has settled down I save Sea Change for moments when I can fully appreciate its perfection and savor the fact that I'm not in school anymore.    This is one of the few albums on which every song is one that I love; I wouldn't change a note.
031606792X|4.0|First of all, I think many readers like me overanticipated this book, putting our own ideas of how things should end with bella, edward, and jacob. Considering how this book is about the supernatural with werewolves and vampires, anything is possible, even an 18 year old girl getting preguent from her vampire husband. What I do wish was answered was how exactly it is possible for a human to get preguent with a vampire, even though it was shown that it is possible with the other half vampire half human Nahuel.     For people to say that Stephanie Meyer is giving out the wrong message to girls by Bella not wanting to give up her baby is ridiculous, you have to understand that this baby no matter what it is, has developed from her love for Edward as we all know how unconditional and passionate it is. So for Bella to want to keep it seems pretty normal to me and her character is known for doing the most unreasonable things to herself to protect what she loves as shown in past books with going to James in Florida or flying all the way to Italy to save Edward.     When Jacob did imprint with Renesmme, don't assume that he's got it all now and will be happy about everything. It can't be easy knowing the one who you use to love is also the maker of your soulmate, it probably doesn't feel right to him either knowing she's a young girl, but she will grow older, which people seem to forget, so i don't want to hear another people calling Jacob a pedophile, its not like he choose to imprint on her.   I admit I was very shocked, it definately wasn't like her other ones where you could digest everything happening in the story slowly, it was all thrown at you almost every few chapters. All the characters changed, especially Bella, she almost seemed too mature in my opinion from becoming a mother, and the focus was now on Renesmme, not Bella and Edward. I hope she writes a book on Renesmme's life, she reminds of Claudia in Interview of a Vampire, but way more sweeter. Anyways don'talways criticize change, because thats how life will always be, for better or worse.
031606792X|2.0|In the novel that completes the globally-acclaimed Twilight saga, Stephenie Meyer takes the series to a new, adult level of maturity. While the story is a page-turner (and about halfway through, almost manages the flavor of the first two books), she doesn't take a single risk, and the lead character of Bella Swan comes off as manufactured and impenetrable, not... special.    After the much-anticipated wedding of Bella and Edward, the two embark on a romantic retreat that leads to the conception of an impossible half-human, half-vampire child. The birth of this hybrid leads to an equally manufactured appearance of the feared Volturi -- an Italian vampire coven met in New Moon that plays as all vampires' judge, jury, and executioner.    Any sense of loss or sacrifice is utterly unattended to; Bella comes off as the luckiest vampire in history, and for as realistic as the universe was created to be, the character seemed out of place. Her usual prophetic dreams were confusing and not as illuminating as in previous novels; they only served to muddle.    The best part of the book, frankly, was the expansion of the Jacob character, who truly grew up from the \\"foil to the Edward-Bella romance\\" he slipped to in Eclipse to an interesting personality in his own right.    Could have been worse, but considering the saga it finishes, could have been so much better, too.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|This season was awesome.  If the DVD release is anything like the previous 2 it will be an awesome set.  The only thing I am upset with is the fact that there were only 16 parts of this season.  Petty, yeah, but hey, I can be petty.  The acting, writing, and episodes are pretty spot on.  As for Bella, I really dont think she will be in season 4.  Well, unless she can crawl.  All in all, a great show, great acting, great writing, just was missing to much for me to be totally happy.  I wanted more, not less!!!
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I never received the item. I tried using a 25.00 gift card which I have on file at Amazon, however the item was to come from a reseller who would not accept the 25 gift card toward the purchase price. I was not aware it was to come from a reseller when I purchased it. I contacted the reseller and cancelled or told him I would refuse it when it came. One did come from Barnes & Noble which I returned for credit to my AMEX.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I don`t understand why there were so many negative reviews for this book. It was the best  possible ending to the great Twilight Saga! In this book Bella and Edward are finally together... FOREVER. I recommend this book to any reader!
1401300529|4.0|Whew! This is some read - great writing, heroes and villains, fatal errors of judgment and wonderful heroism all encompassed in Halberstam's last book.<br /><br />Most of the dominant players in the book are well known - Truman, MacArthur, Stalin, Mao, Marshall. The author paints good portraits of Truman and MacArthur and their intense dislike for each other.<br />As a keynote speaker on communications I find it intriguing that Douglas MacArthur's speech to Congress - Old Soldiers Never Die - is treated as being one of history's great speeches. The man was a megalomaniac whom Halberstam suggests cared for no one but himself. His speech to Congress (as we Irish like to say)  full of blarney, but blarney that had cost the lives of many. The author records many instances to indict MacArthur, but the simplest and most basic one is this man did not spend one night in Korea during the war. That is just mind-boggling.<br /><br />MacArthur was badly served by a bunch of sycophantic nincompoops, who not only kow-towed  to his every wish but deliberately misled Washington about what was really happening in Korea. The biggest culprit here was MacArthur's intelligence chief Brigadier General Charles Willoughby whose deliberate manipulation of intelligence cost the lives of many American soldiers. If Willoughby was half as devious as Halberstam suggests, his actions were not far short of treason.<br /><br />While MacArthur and his acolytes are the true villains on the American side, Harry Truman does not escape unscathed. In a country that admittedly was tired of war, Truman allowed defense spending to fall to unacceptable levels. Thus when the Korean War broke out, the US initially could only send a poorly trained, poorly equipped military. The initial problem with Korea was Harry Truman was \\"dealing with a war he did not want, in a part of the world his national security people had not thought important, relying from the start on a commander in the field whom he did not like, and who in turn did not respect him.\\" - Apart from that everything else was fine.<br /><br />Halberstam takes us through some of the key battles of the war - Unsan, the failure to anticipate the Chinese invasion, Inchon (where MacArthur's plan proved brilliantly successful and according to a TIME correspondent led to the deification of the general fueled his ego), the breakout from the Chosin Reservoir and many others. In describing these battles he profiles many brave soldiers and the horrible weather conditions they had to endure.<br /><br />If I have one criticism of his profiles it is that the good guys are really good - brave, upstanding, honest, genuine etc. while the bad guys are really bad - incompetent, lying, devious. Maybe they were but the portraits tend to be very black and white.<br /><br />The turning point in the war was the appointment of Matthew Ridgway to lead the US effort and the recall of MacArthur, something which proved to be a major political liability for Truman initially. To some extent, Halberstam skims over the period after MacArthur's removal which is probably why some might claim this is not a true history of the war.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great read. It is very long and for a non-military person sometimes (but not often) tough going. Halberstam died shortly after finalizing this book. The man went out in style.ect him.\\" - Apart from that everything else was fine.

031606792X|1.0|We all know the pain that Bella went through in New Moon. The crying at first, and then just wanting to forget. To completly erase all of the bad memories from her mind. She walked around like a zombie trying to just keep herself together. Well I can officially say I have gotten a slice of the pain that Bella went through. I have been waiting for this book for what seems like forever. I read the quotes of the days, I discussed, I speculated, I did everything that a crazed teenage fan would do, yet I am sitting here wondering what I did to deserve this kind of punishment. My favorite books and characters completly destroyed within a 754 page book. I always thought that Stephenie Meyer would deliver a great book, however i was sorely mistaken. Instead she gave us a twisted, if not creepy romance with a Bella who can't do anything but think about Edward. She has no sense of independence and freedom. Before I believed that the Twilight books set great examples for teens, but that thought has diminished. Stephenie is saying that it's okay to be with an abusive boyfriend, to get married right out of high school, to not go to college and to get pregnant when it's obvious your not ready to be a mother. Oh but don't worry, everything will be fine because you know that crazy best friend you had, well yea he's gonna fall in love with your new born daughter. how cute, nahh creepy is more the right word.I could go on and on about how disapointing these books were. But for anyone who is planning on buying this book, don't. Make up your own ending whithout \\"nessie\\". I mean that's what I wish i had done.
031606792X|1.0|I've enjoyed these books so far...then I got to Breaking Dawn. This book was extremely dull. It couldn't hold my attention and when it did, I was throughly disgusted with what was happening. Its just strange to imagine timid Bella having a child and then Jacob suddenly imprinting on that baby after being in love with its mum for years. Sometimes a sad ending needs to happen. It was a very candy coated book, a sad excuse for the ending to a well written series. I am upset I read this book, because it put a puddle on the series for me. I am even more displeased that I stayed up all night reading it.     Props on the first three books though, those were brilliant. Read those, then stop...forget Breaking Dawn existed.
0780619587|5.0|Even my 8 and 10 year old children loved this movie which inspired them to practise harder their piano lessons ! The story needed some explainations for them but then made my children think for days about it. They finally understood how own behavior can influence especially weaker persons and that you have to be aware of it... A very loving and caring story !
B00005JNQS|2.0|I really wanted to like this one, but about a third of the way through, I knew it was the same old story line, the same old voices (Robin Williams) and lost interest.<br />The picture is beautiful to look at, there is some effort, but when the laughs come from Robin one-liners, then you know what you're in for.<br />My children liked it and laughed, so if you have children aged up to 10, I'm sure they'll enjoy it, but for us parents...not so much.
0385340567|1.0|As the \\"fastest\\" reader in the family I usually get to read a new novel by a favorite author first then pass it on.  As huge fans, we all were so excited when this new \\"Jack Reacher\\" arrived but I'm afraid I can't even recommend it to the rest of the gang after plodding through it.  I will definitely wait for the reviews to come out before purchasing another of Mr. Child's books.
006085880X|4.0|\\"The Pact,\\" my first Jodi Picoult novel, was a pleasant surprise.  I didn't think that this best selling author of books in which the covers look similar to Danielle Steele romances would write so well.  Picoult knows how to keep the reader riveted (and buying more of her books), but also writes in a fairly sophisticated manner, which is somewhat rare these days.  She also obviously takes time to research her books: the investigation of the crime and courtroom drama were more accurately presented than I thought they might be.    In reading alot of the other reviews, as well as blurbs of some of Picoult's other novels, it's obvious that she follows a general formula: an initial scene of relative domestic bliss, conflict that seems minor at first, conflict builds, conflict explodes, resolution with a bit of a twist.  I understand that many of her books contain some sort of ambiguous crime followed by an ensuing courtroom drama.  Perhaps then, one should try to space this author's books over a number of months in order to get past the formula.    SPOILER ALERT!!!  Anyway, there were problems I had with certain elements of the main characters and plot which might make for a rousing discussion in a reading group (I understand that the author sometimes attends same when asked).  Basically, in \\"The Pact,\\" a boy (Chris) and girl (Emily) grow up with each other and share different (and sometimes contradictory) relationships: neighbors, inseparable best friends, brother/sister, lovers.  Their parents are very close as well and hope that Chris and Emily will end up more than friends and even marry one day.  I didn't particularly feel that either set of parents put much pressure on either child to finally \\"hook up\\" when they became teenagers, but they certainly weren't unhappy about it when it happened.  But let's face it: the scenario where two sets of parents who want their son and daughter to get together is not exactly unusual.    And then the conflict emerges: Chris wantsto push the sexual relationship with Emily, whereas Emily feels more \\"sisterly\\" towards Chris, but doesn't dare drive him away by telling him something like \\"I just want to be friends\\" like pretty much anyone else would do (Emily feels so close to Chris that she can't bare to see him with another girl).  Plus, we have an added complication that Emily was molested when she was 9 (by a grubby, wall-eyed fast food employee -- right out of central casting), so it may be that she would have difficulty with a physical relationship with ANY guy -- we just don't know.      When Emily gets unexpectedly pregnant by Chris she begins to feel trapped with only one way out.  Does Chris form a \\"suicide pact\\" with her, or does he kill her, or something else?  Chris is arrested, jailed and put on trial for \\"murder one\\" (why the prosecutor didn't include some lesser charges like manslaughter and/or aiding and abetting a suicide is beyond me).  Chris and Emily's parents react in very different (and occasionally contrived) ways.    I guess my main criticism with the plot was that, although I might reluctantly accept that someone like Emily (beautiful, accomplished and loved) might not seek help for her suicidal feelings, I couldn't accept why otherwise sensible Chris, who allegedly loves her more than all the world besides, would just pretend to go through with the suicide hoping Emily would change her mind at the last minute rather than seek help for her from a trusted adult or a school counselor, especially given that he has no idea what's making her so depressed.  Stupid Chris actually brings a gun with real bullets to Emily hoping beyond hope that she won't go through with it (here's a thought Chris: why not bring blanks?).    Despite the problems I had with the plot, I recommend \\"The Pact,\\" and, eventually, I'll try another Picoult novel.
031606792X|1.0|Okay, I was NOT PLEASED.    You know what disturbed me most about this book? It wasn't the pedophilia (although, *ew*). It wasn't the truly momentous amount of retcon that had to go on for this to even remotely make sense (did she ever explain why Bella was the wunder-infant-vamp? I don't think she did, it was just plot-convenient). It wasn't the overt racism (come on, the South American vampires wear *animal skins* and are actually described as feral and uncivilized? Good grief Meyer, surely you're not that culturally insensitive). It wasn't even the creepy, creepy way she seemed so happy about Jacob imprinting, which (and she literally writes this out, right there on the page) invalidated every emotion he'd ever experienced, all his personal history, and took away his free will.    No, the thing that disturbed me most was the outright, blatant misogyny, and the way Meyer seems to smile at it all, or even think it's cute. Haha, women want sex so bad they're willing to beg for it, but they're BAD GIRLS if they do it before they're married. Haha, women aren't valuable as people and shouldn't have self-worth until they're preternaturally pretty and having babies. Haha, men have can have multiple medical degrees, but there's no reason for women to be educated beyond high school. Haha, let's all joke about dumb blondes (because putting down girls is *fun*! Jasper is also blond but never catches flack for it) and then we can throw things at the dumb girls with little provocation, so hard the silver dog bowl flattens out when it hits Rose. Heeheehee, violence, isn't that funny? Let's have all the characters make jokes about it right after!    OR! Or we could laugh about how it's perfectly okay for Edward to bruise Bella black and blue during sex and she'll beg for more, but Bella has to be extra-special careful not to hurt Edward once she's the stronger of the pair (has this woman never even heard of domestic violence, or is she just too oblivious to know that 32 millionAmericans alone are victims of domestic abuse?). OR! Or we could all point and laugh when the women who are childless or infertile all become bitches (Leah) or monsters (Rose) or both, because clearly women who are infertile all feel incomplete and unloved, and can only compensate by being shrews. Then everyone can make snide remarks about their self-esteem issues too, and tell them that no one wants them around! It's not mean or cruel to tell them they're unwanted and to exclude them (as Jacob constantly tells Leah she's unwanted, and Edward constantly tells Rose), because they're uppity girls, it's not like they're actual people with feelings.    God, Meyer, your audience is GIRLS. They're the ones who are reading these books, they're your whole fanbase. One would think you'd love your fanbase, right? So why do you hate women so much?
1594489505|4.0|When my book club selected this title for the July meeting, so soon after reviewing \\"The Kite Runner\\" I decided NOT to read \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" - I felt as if I'd read enough about Afghanistan for the time being and wasn't really interested in purchasing and reading this book too. But after finishing the August book selection (The Last Lecture) - I was fidgety and looking for something to read. So I caved in and ordered this book. When it arrived I was still not certain that I'd enjoy it, but I was determined to muddle through. WOW! Was I surprised that I had it finished within TWO DAYS!     A Thousand Splendid Suns was, in my opinion, a much more compelling read than the Kite Runner. And I was pleasantly surprised at the authors ability, as a man, to write from the perspective of the female characters. I'd give this book two thumbs up!! A definite must read title.
031606792X|1.0|This story seems very disjointed from the three leading up to it.... and it was a disappointment.  Tread carefully before deciding to purchase or even read.  A reader can be happy with just stopping at Eclipse...
031606792X|5.0|I heard the spoilers previous to buying the book at midnight, and let me tell you, I was devastated. I was all over the Amazon boards agreeing with everyone and questioning SM's drug use.  But once I started reading to book, I found it amazing.   Really.  *Spoilers*  The whole Jake and Nessie thing was really cute. Not weird in any way.  Bella's gift was not very exciting, but it was fitting.  And while everything wasn't exactly perfect, I still think the book ended really nicely.  I recommend you read it. Right Now. :)  I will continue to stare dejectedly at the book, sad that the saga is over.
031606792X|2.0|**SOME SPOILERS**<br /><br />I liked Twilight a lot. New Moon and Eclipse not so much, but I was looking forward to Breaking Dawn although the spoilers weren't promising. And really, what a disappointment!<br />BD has many things I expected, such as Bella and Edward's wedding, her turning to vampire, Jacob's Imprinting, a new meeting / confrontation with the Volturi... But I couldn't enjoy them given the way the plot developed.<br />The previous books had a different flow. BD it's very rushed, so you don't have time to recover from one shocked moment to the next. It feels really different.<br />The story is told from two POVs - Bella's and Jacob's. This one is very interesting to see Edward and Bella's relationship from an external perspective.<br /><br />One thing happens that changes drastically the book: Bella's pregnancy. If you don't like or accept it, it's very difficult to enjoy BD: the pregnancy triggers a lot of behaviours and situations. I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't. It isn't consistent with the \\"vampires can't have children\\" we learn in previous books, and considering how it went, gross. Bella made a choice, was willing to sacrifice everything (her parents, her future children, her life), to be with Edward, and that was really touching - although a little disturbing, too. The baby \\"ruined\\" this feeling: it seems S. Meyer put it to have a (unnecessary) big happy sugary end.<br /><br />Before BD Bella was weak, passive, indecisive and too dependant of Edward. In BD, because of the baby, she is forced to mature, although I can't see her sufficiently adult to deal with it. She also becomes a vampire -strong at last!- but her power is very cheesy.<br />Jacob also matures, something well shown in his POV. At first he continues obsessed with Bella, but he has more balanced thoughts and behaves much better than in Eclipse. What I hate is the resolution of his story, his Imprinting. Sick and creepy, one of the worst parts of the book.<br />Edward continues much the same: unbelievably gorgeous (so tired of this...), and very protective and worried about Bella. The pregnancy hits him real bad, so bad he asks Jacob something disgusting, worse after knowing the whole Nessie thing. I know he was worried and hurting a lot, but there I lost all respect for him.<br /><br />At the end all the important characters have their HEA, but I wish it was done differently, in a way the message we got from the book wasn't so wrong: all is perfect with a husband and baby at 18 and don't worry about education, hobbies or life in general outside family.<br /><br />Even so, I recommend reading the book, perhaps because I don't like leaving series unfinished by a book, or because after all, we all have different opinions, and I'm sure some people will like it. But perhaps it would be better to borrow it from a friend or the library.(so tired of this...), and very protective and worried about Bella.

031606792X|5.0|This book is getting a load of bad reviews and I just don't get it. The first part of the book really delivers. Then things get a little weird when it switches to Jake's perspective but please keep going! The last third of the book has all that Twilight Magic. It is beautiful! The last part of the book will leave you breathless. Do not let other's opinions stop you from reading the true happily ever after our beloved vampires/werewolves deserved!! Thanks Stephenie for a great ending! We cannot wait to see you in the Windy City!!!

B000002BFZ|4.0|With 1996's \\"No Code\\", Pearl Jam began to shift away from the limelight and dove deep into themselves to produce a record that is both diverse and entertaining.    \\"Sometimes\\" begins the album, a track that is moody, and somewhat somber, exploring religious themes about the creation of man and man's struggle through life while remaining concise.    The next track, \\"Hail, Hail\\" picks up the pace, with a dirty, fuzzed out riff and a good bass line. The song manages to take the somewhat depressing lyrics about a relationship gone wrong while staying fast paced, and as the song goes on some hope manages to seep in.    The next two songs, \\"Who You Are\\" and \\"In My Tree\\" pick up in \\"Sometimes\\" place after the frenetic \\"Hail, Hail\\", with rolling, almost tribal drum beats carried by Jeff Ament's bass and Eddie's voice.    \\"Smile\\" has a riff with a similar dirty quality to it, and relatively simplistic lyrics. The harmonica interspersed throughout adds another dimension to the trudging rocker, making it one of the more standout tracks.    \\"Off He Goes\\" is one of my favorites from the album. The lyrics set a narrative over a slow acoustic guitar, telling the story of a friend that sets off on a trip brought on by what could be strains in his personal life (\\"Know a man...his face seems pulled and tense.../  Like he's riding on a motorbike... in the strongest winds\\"), and as doubts creep into the narrator's mind about this friend's return, he unexpectedly shows up again, seemingly the same person. However, he is soon off again, and the song ends on a note similar to how it started.    \\"Habit\\" has a garage rock/grunge-type riff to it, with muddled and often hard-to-understand vocals from Vedder. It seems to explore the drug use of someone close, how it's wrong for them but yet they're still sucked in and on the way to self-destruction. However, the two breakdowns Both crammed into a 3:36 song), coupled with the guitar solo (Which is pretty impressive) fading out right as it getssome good momentum behind it, put the track lower than it deserves to be.    \\"Red Mosquito\\" has something closer to a country rock vibe going for it, with interesting vocal melodies. It's got a good flow and progression to it, and is one of the better tracks off the album.    However, the next song takes a turn for the more abrasive side of Pearl Jam. \\"Lukin\\" is a 1 minute long song, with a simple three-chord riff and screechy vocals from Vedder, describing his own fallacies and a stalker that might or might not be out to kill him.    \\"Present Tense\\" is a slow and introspective number, which also happened to put me in a much better mindset after some personal issues that had plagued me. The atmospheric guitar work during the verses highlight the lyrics and message without getting in the way, but I'll leave that message for you to discover yourself. It's worth it.    \\"Mankind\\" is something that is either enjoyable or unenjoyable in my opinion, with little to no middle ground. Rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard employs the mic on this song, who also wrote the lyrics for the song. What's being conveyed is a man that is watching mankind obsess over the little things, while he sits back and wonders why. Again, you either like it or you don't.    \\"I'm Open\\" begins and ends with spoken word poetry from Vedder, which is interesting to listen but may end up leaving the impression of him being pretentious and rambling. For those who can appreciate the song, though, it's an interesting piece of music that deserves a bit more praise.    \\"Around The Bend\\" finishes the album, a number mostly carried by the bass and drums. The vocals are soothing and relaxing, and listening to it right now in my tired state is actually wearing me down further! The story behind it is that Vedder wrote it as a lullaby for one of the member's kids, and that quality leaves it's fingerprints through the whole song, both in lyrics and instrumentation. It's good to listen to when you want to get away from everything, if only for four minutes, because of it's optimistic and calming lyrics.    Overall, Pearl Jam took a big chance with this album. It is markedly a much slower tempo than their previous albums, and marked the point in the band's history when they shifted to a less commercial and more mature entity. Of course the album was greeted with less-than-stellar sales, but it was well worth it in my mind.
B000SJ5XF0|4.0|It took me forever, but I'm just finally learning to appreciate Zeppelin's most famous album right now. I won't say it's my favorite - I, II and III are just as good, and Houses of the Holy is better. But I now like it. In fact, I think I liked it all the while, but I refused to admit it. See, this marks the point where \\"Led Zeppelin the band\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin the cultural phenomenon\\" become the same thing. And while I'm definitely a fan of Led Zep the band, I'm kinda shaky on Led Zeppelin the cultural phenomenon. And, I mean, this is the BIG one. The pride and joy of fans, critics, and DJ's everywhere. That and it's got \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" a cultural phenomenon within a cultural phenomenon within a cultural phenomenon. Sort of a Russian nesting doll deal there.<br />Methinks the problem I had with this for so long is because I listened to it expecting it to be the great masterpiece so many people say it is, and I never really heard it that way. But recently, I did the smart thing: I let my defenses down, and listened to the album for what it was. And I found that it was quite good.<br />Let me be up-front about why I'm only giving this four stars. First off, I don't really like \\"Four Sticks.\\" Parts of it are nice, and parts of it aren't. Secondly, there's the issue of Robert Plant. I've never been his biggest fan, but here he's too much for me, almost ruining a couple of his songs with his \\"vocal acrobatics.\\" He nearly kills the stop-start, riff-filled \\"Black Dog\\" entirely for me with his moans, groans, and grunts behind the guitar solo. Yeah, so it fits with the song's lyrics. But it still sounds bad. And \\"Battle of Evermore,\\" despite being genuinely gorgeous, also showcases Plant right up in the front. He makes his voice turn somersaults, backflips, and cartwheels, and it just annoys me. Every phrase he gets, he oversings somehow. And then he pulls that crap with an echo effect near the end. It really annoys me. 'Tis a shame they didn't just let ex-Fairport Convention member Sandy Denny sing lead on the whole track, because she's got a beautiful voice. Not only that, but she's also got an authentic English folk voice, and \\"Evermore\\" is an English folk song. With a fantastic mandolin part.<br />Okay, now I can get to the really good parts. First off, I almost hate to admit it because I'm sick of everyone saying it's the best song ever (gimme a break, it isn't even Zeppelin's best!), but I really, really like \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" I won't dwell too much on it, because everyone is probably familiar with it at this point, but it's earned its reputation as one of the greatest guitar tracks in history, and it's definitely a great rock epic. The Hendrix maniac in me thinks \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" is the best, the Beatlemaniac in me puts \\"Hey Jude\\" in second, and the Who freak in me would rank \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" as third. But number four (or maybe number five or six, because I can never allow myself to forget \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" or \\"Jungleland\\") is certainly nothing to sneeze at, especially considering how many genuinely wretched \\"rock epics\\" there are out there. Great song, even though I'd take \\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\" \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,\\" and \\"Ramble On\\" over it in the Zeppelin catalog. That's just me, though. No \\"serious\\" person likes \\"Misty Mountain Hop,\\" but I think it's fun. Yeah, the lyrics are dumb, but in the harmless, \\"'70s pothead who says words like 'dude' and 'cosmic' a lot, laughs at absolutely nothing, and eats ten bags of Cheetos a day\\" sense, not in the \\"offensively stupid or ignorant\\" sense. In other words, harmless, and kinda funny. Actually, all the lyrics in Led Zeppelin's entire history that aren't about sex are like that. Plus it's so bouncy! It's the only Zeppelin song you can dance to! How about that? It's a guilty pleasure for me, but I still enjoy it immensely. \\"Rock and Roll\\" does just what it promises, and it's my favorite of Zeppelin's short, punchy rockers. Bonzo's rhythm is unbeatable, and there's a multi-tracked guitar solo. Despite my seeming lack of manliness (yeah, I'm a guy), I do have some testosterone, and it really gets what little of it there is pounding. By the opposite token, \\"Going to California\\" is one of the prettiest, most quaint, folksy, and downright cute things in Zeppelin's catalog. Despite me not being much of a Robert Plant fan, I still love the way he sings, \\"La-la-la-la-la\\" after one of the verses. It's just so damn adorable! And I know that every Zeppelin fan who wasn't theoretically stabbing my hypothetical picture already is doing so now, but hey. Adorable is good. And you want a searing musical interpretation of a hurricane? Check out \\"When the Levee Breaks,\\" a very successful mood piece and arguably the best song on the record. Bonzo's drums thunder - his intro is justly one of the most famous of all time - Page's guitars sting, burn, and all kinds of other stuff, and Plant's harmonica wails away. John Paul Jones doesn't do much,  which is a shame, because he's my favorite member of the band. But hey, you can't have it all.<br />If you were to cut out \\"Four Sticks,\\" and give Robert Plant a bit less time at the mike, this would be a better album. But it's fine the way it is. I still refuse to admit it or anything else Zeppelin ever made is a masterpiece. If that's the way you roll, more power to you. But it's not the way I roll. So no power for me. Oh well. Still, this is probably my second, third, fourth, fifth, or whatever Zeppelin album. It's tough to decide between those first four. They're all very worthy four-star records, and I actually think they're of the exact same quality, more or less. Whatever.

1932907009|5.0|I have read over a dozen screen writer books and this one feels more like you are hearing good advice from someone who has sold scripts, had movies made, and can truly be called a professional writer versus just a writer living off of aspiring writers looking for any insight, knowledge, and advice. It is nice Snyder does not take himself to seriously. It is an entertaining read while being educational.     Snyder is among a growing number who are saying start with things like the title, log line, and movie poster. If you cannot make those things peak the interest of those who you test it on, then why waste weeks or months doing a script that in the end will likely get over looked because it does not have that spark. Sadly, the studio movie business is a business, not an art foundation. If that kind of statement turns you off, then \\"Save The Cat!\\" will turn you off. Don't get me wrong, I am all for truly original content, but the business nature of the modern studio make very original scripts a hard sell. Snyder is trying to give readers a straight formula for giving your scripts the best shot at being bought and also doing well in the theaters.     This will not be the last boon on screenwriting you will ever need, but it should one every writer reads. I also have the follow up to this book, which if you love this one then you enjoy \\"Save The Cat: Goes to the Movies\\".

031606792X|5.0|I was alittle upset at first of how everything ended up but then again now i couldn't see it any other way. I fell in love with Renesmee and was suprised at how nice Rose was to Bella.With Jacob I thought that he could have also ended up with Leah but was happy with his decission. over all i am happy about Stephenie's latest book even if it was a little odd.
0894803123|5.0|We've tried almost all of the recipes in this book and haven't found a one yet that isn't delicious.  They aren't quite as creamy has the custard style ice creams found in other books, but still much better than anything you can get at the store (including Ben and Jerry's).  These are the recipes to have if you want something quick and easy.

B0015DYIH2|2.0|Having a kindle should mean acess to newly released books right away. I think it is ridiculous that the book is not available the same time as the paper version. Truley a disappointment
031606792X|1.0|I have to agree with everyone else's negative reviews. The series ends with Eclipse. This book was the most bizarre story I have ever read. I personally like when an author ties up all the loose ends but to completely change everything you said previously to cram in something that shouldn't make sense...I mean its just ridiculous. Its like she completely lost her direction and started writing anything she could think of and would break her own rules in the twilight world just so it would fit. It wasn't pretty and I didn't enjoy it...
1594481717|5.0|My copy  of A whole New Mind has highlighted text and page markers everywhere. I call this my new business bible. (I am still incredibly fond of my last-Primal Leadership)    This book is great for anyone who leads people, is concerned about their own skill set and how to be marketable, or has kids they are trying to guide down the right path.     It is easy to read, gives examples to clarify and ways to build the necessary skills that will take all of us into the next century.
031606792X|1.0|..Really?    I was fortunate enough not to read any spoilers for this; I wish I would have. I could have saved myself the hours I spent reading it.    I mean... really? This was Breaking Dawn? This was the conclusion to an otherwise entertaining and touching - if somewhat overhyped - series? What happened to the conflicts that bound us to these characters? What happened to all of the choices and ultimatums. Hell, what happened to the story?    One of the biggest obstacles, the first year as a newborn that Bella has to survive and endure, just.. disappears? She gets to skip by the price of becoming immortal with a few pages of time-warped pain and no further consequences?     Even if I had been able to get past the fact that she didn't have to lose anything for her immortality - not motherhood, not Jacob, not her father, not even that year of time - I still would not be able to forgive the absolutely flat plotline. Six hundred pages of buildup, just to have the villain change their mind and walk away?    ...Really?    I have always felt that the hype of the book was a little overrated, particularly calling it the 'next Harry Potter'. While I never thought that this series compared to HP, I did enjoy it. Up until now. If ever Twilight had a hope of going down in history with even close to HP-level acclaim, Meyer shot it down with this 700-page monstrosity.
031606792X|4.0|I just got Breaking Dawn, and really didn't go into it expecting much, after all, the complaints made it seem like some horrific book that wasn't to be touched let alone printed, but I ended up enjoying it. I think the people that complain about the story and hate it aren't mature enough to appreciate it. SM did an amazing job trying to tie a lot of loose ends, and although I, like many others, had to put the book down a few times, when I got myself to finish it I enjoyed it immensly.     In my opinion, many people really just weren't ready for an ending, and had become so attatched to the endings they had made up themselves that Stephanie's fell short. It is impossible, as an author, to please everyone. Completely impossible. In anticipation for this book I read hundreds of endings made up by fans out of curiousity and each and every one of them were such polar opposites that I had no idea how anyone could try to live up to such wild expectations. And somehow, SM did a fairly good job.     To everyone who reads reviews on how bad this book is, to not buy it, or if you have bought it, to 'burn it', please don't listen. It is all a matter of taste and level of maturity. If you don't like the book, then thats your opinion, but you might be surprised.    I know I was.
B0017VG69U|1.0|There should have been a Blju-Ray of this is the studio had any respect for the fans, who hugely overpaid for the fiasco first season on HD-DVD. PLEASE teach the studio a lesson and DON'T BUY this until a Blu-Ray version gets issued - as it should have been simultaneously with this.

031606792X|1.0|As I started reading \\"Breaking Dawn\\", i was overwhelmed with tremendous excitement! I was anticipating the moments I had imagined over and over again in my head, and i knew everything i was hoping would happen, would.   I'm your run of the mill Twilighter, and im always hoping Edward and Bella will prevail! Having no doubt in my mind that my biggest dreams for Twilight would come true, i began to read the book that would ruin my perspective of Stephenie Meyer.  SPOILERS**********************************************************************  Was Stephenie persuaded with a large amount of money, and held captive, forced to write in such a horrible manner? Did Stephenie mean to trick all of her teenage fans, into thinking The Twilight saga was appropriate for \\"young adults\\". Filled with sex, and gore Breaking Dawn was my biggest disappointment. I am 15 years old, and have been enthralled in the series for quite some time. I have confided in my friends, shared my views, and cried with Twilight in my hands. After feeling so deeply connected to it, i felt... betrayed. Breaking Dawn lacked all of the things i so deeply loved about Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse, it lacked its descriptiveness and creativity. I had no mental picture in my mind throughout the whole book because of how non-descriptive it was. All innocence is shattered as your view of Edward becomes tainted in a gruesome love making session. I cringed and began seeing all the characters i knew and loved turn into disgusting monsters. In the first 3 i loved that even though the Cullens where vampires, they could still be civilized and so innocent, though now they have been made into monsters. The worst part of all, is that the Bella we all cared so deeply for, has yes, become a vampire like we all wanted her to, but a monster as well in the process.       I have no words to describe Breaking dawn really, I can sum it up in one word though.  MISTAKE     As long as Edward and Bella both shall live,my friends andmyself included will bad talk the likes of this book, which is for eternity!    I HATE TWILIGHT!

031606792X|2.0|The fans who stuck by this series, regardless of age, will be dissatisfied with this product. I still love Stephenie Meyer's first three in this saga, yet the fourth seemed to be written by someone who did not care for the established story. I loved Bella's vulnerability and naivet&eacute;; Edward's love, maturity, SENSIBILITY; Jacobs playfulness, loyalty and his love as well. The traits I fell in love with were almost forgotten. Edward gave into Bella's irrational wants and the rest of the book hung on his indecisions.<br /><br />Sure, fans got what they wanted in every way possible. I agree with other fans: cop out. All of the tragic novels mentioned in the previous books (Romeo and Juliet for example) should have been a compass to what love stories inevitably are: tragic. There was a line that talked about how it was strange when puzzle pieces finally fit together for Bella, they were all about to come undone. That is real. This book? Not so much.<br /><br />Petition for rewrite? Sorry Stephenie Meyer seems like you missed the mark for a lot of people on this one. I refuse to believe this is what you have been dying for your fans to read.

031606792X|2.0|Admittedly, I'm not the biggest Twilight fan on the planet. I don't find them well written or original, but they are compelling. This last novel cemented the fact that I probably won't be rereading the series. Meyer takes the little characterization she built up in the first three books and makes almost every character in Breaking Dawn seem out of character. Mostly I feel bad for the big fans of the series for getting such a disappointing ending. The draw of Eclipse was the fact that Bella couldn't have it all - she could choose immortality with Edward or to grow old and have a family with Jacob. Meyer conveniently, using a huge plot hole, allowed Bella to have it all and I don't feel like she is relatable to anyone at all anymore, which was her attraction. I hope some people do enjoy the book, but for me, I wish the series ended at Eclipse.

B00000J7JO|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers's 1999 album \\"Californication\\" is often recognized as one of their best efforts, often ranked second only to \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". And with that being said, \\"Californication\\" is great for both newcomers to the Peppers and fans who want to complete their RHCP collection.  What I really love about this album is the summery feel to it. I remember finishing my finals early June, coming home and popping this in at 10:30 in the morning. The second I heard the chorus to \\"Around The World\\", I knew it was time for my summer soundtrack to return!  The whole album is very strong and well put-together, and shows how far the guys in the band have come. The fifteen songs that make up \\"Californication\\" all flow nicely and sustain a level of energy, mood and high spirits we've come to know the Chili Peppers by. The songs combine funk, alternative rock, experimental rock, even some occasional bluesiness and heavy metal. Some highlights of the album include:  \\"Around The World\\": A super-energetic introduction features a thundering bassline and some screeching, psychedelic guitar lines. The verses are very catchy, Anthony going about in his rap-rock styles, and the chorus is so melodic and beautiful, it sets the tone for the whole song.  \\"Parallel Universe\\": A basic but fast-paced song with a new-wave/punk guitar line and very atmospheric lyrics sung in Anthony's signature voice. A great chorus that builds up with lots of energy.  \\"Scar Tissue\\": A softer, melodic ballad with some jazzy rhythm section work and great, bluesy guitar lines. Anthony's lyrics and voice all add to the song, and overall this is one of the best songs by RHCP ever!  \\"Emit Remmus\\": A jittery, low-key bassline and a slower pace occupy this song, which is apparently written about Anthony's relationship with the chick from the Spice Girls, read his autobiography \\"Scar Tissue\\" for more information. Anyway, the guitar in the chorus is very thrashy, in a good way, and the lyrics are odd and poetic, at the top of their game just like on the rest of the album.  \\"I Like Dirt\\": A short, funky two-and-a-half-minute jam in B-minor, featuring some deliciously double-entendre lyrics and a cool guitar solo.  \\"Road Trippin'\\": A mellow, acoustic ballad that closes off the album, Anthony's lyrics and singing as great as they always are.    With all the other songs alongside these, \\"Californication\\" is one of the strongest album of the last 10 years, and ends the '90s with a bang. As a RHCP fan, I wholeheartedly recommend getting this as soon as possible, take a nice, long cruise down the highway near the foresty area not too far form your home, blast this, and feel it work its magic. It's worked for me, as I love this album, and I know you will, too. Thanks for the time, and peace.
0563486430|3.0|This Doctor Who novel starts out with so much potential. It opens with a delightfully clever attention-grabbing puzzle: a 2000-year-old statue of the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler, in the British Museum. This of course leads to a promising trip to the old Roman Empire to solve the puzzle. Science fiction with a clever historical setting--quintessential Doctor Who, say no more. Once in Rome, more mysteries greet the Doctor and Rose (abruptly disappearing sons, inexplicably clairvoyant slave girls) amidst a finely layered and convincingly detailed evocation of everyday life in this specific time and place on Earth.<br /><br />As the Fates would have it, though, things start going awry. The mystery of the disappearing son and the villain behind it and this situation's connection to the Rose statue swiftly becomes painfully dreadfully obvious and openly apparent to any but the most clueless reader, to the point that the Doctor (especially, and even Rose eventually) looks positively thick for not catching on. This is a serious lapse in writing; the Doctor may be bumbling and eccentric, but never oblivious and slow on the uptake. As the tale grinds on, the Roman setting starts losing its anchoring sense of reality (perhaps the novel's primary saving grace while it lasts) and the plot devolves from inspired quirkiness to cutesy silliness and then devolves again into something just short of muddled chaos.<br /><br />The characters of the Doctor and Rose as they were at some indeterminate point early in the second series/season ([[ASIN:B000JBWWP6 Doctor Who - The Complete Second Series]]) are skillfully and accurately portrayed for the most part. The plebian goodness of Rose is spot-on, and the casually frenetic manner of the Tenth Doctor is distinctly drawn most of the time, though some cringe-inducing moments have him dropping out of character and behaving like the hero in a romantic drama. And this is just a personal nitpick, perhaps, but the Doctor HAS been to Rome before ([[ASIN:B001U3ZYXO Doctor Who: The Rescue / The Romans (Episodes 11 & 12)]]) and a brief passing reference to this fact would have been a pleasing wink n' nod to old time fans like myself without unduly confusing newcomers, I think. Otherwise a host of reasonably defined but rather uncomplicated supporting characters also populate the tale, of course, as well as plausible though slightly caricatured portrayals of Rose's family and friends from the show.<br /><br />To make a long epic short, if \\"The Stone Rose\\" were fan fiction posted online by a teenage girl with a huge crush on David Tennant for the free edification of her peers, it would be an impressively talented example of its genre. As a professionally written work of science fiction, though, it is a somewhat entertaining but inexcusably flawed work saved from total mediocrity only by the author's acknowledged long and abiding interest in Roman history and perhaps the favor of blind fortune.3ZYXO Doctor Who: The Rescue / The Romans (Episodes 11 & 12)]]) and a brief passing reference to this fact would have been a pleasing wink n' nod to old time fans like myself without unduly confusing newcomers, I think.

B000MV8ABS|5.0|Phantasm is a late '70s supernatural fantasy horror movie that does a great job of combining atmosphere, creepy nightmares, flying sphere-violence, location, characters, events and scares into one great, big bundle of nightmarish joy.  As an artist with a love of all things odd, unusual, beautiful, surreal, spooky and fun, this movie delivers all that and a bag of evil chips from another dimension.  Let me describe the highlights and joys of this movie:  The creepy, old cemetery setting.  The mystical, surreal hallways under the morgue.  The flying spheres with daggers at the end that contributed a great gore scene.  The almost stereotypical '70s fellas, with their collar-length hair, leather jackets and love of rock.  The evil midgets that chase you and spew yellow vomit.  The terrifying Tall Man that loves screaming, \\"Boyyyyy!!!!!\\".  The fact that the movie has the guts to add in a room with a doorway to a parallel universe halfway through.    Well, that's saying a lot right there, but I won't give away anything else of the movie. Phantasm has gone on to become a cult favorite of movie lovers everywhere, and if you haven't seen it but wanna watch something cool, scary and unusual, I wholeheartedly recommend this gem. Thanks for the time, and peace.
031606792X|1.0|As you read this book and are terribly dissappointed by it, just remeber she is a mormon.  Big families and all that.  So its just fine an 18 year old girl gets married and has a baby right away.  Forget career, college or reality.  I loved the other books but this was just awful.. The movie looks terribly cheesy and poorly scripted as well.. She should have taken more time and thought it through and sent them off too college.
B0017MO10U|3.0|I have watched Stargate from Day One and loved it, but I was let down by this seemingly finale' to a great show and cast.  There was just too much of a lull in the middle that I got bored, and just too little fight scenes.      I didn't like how the government split them up and I wondered how they got each other's cell phone numbers when they were not to communicate, but that's life.      I just didn't believe the government would let them live on their own or utilize their knowledge until after Baal appeared.  Granted, I believed the part of the government setting on their butts, but with all of Carter's knowledge they would not have let her go off and live a solidary life.    I caught the twist in the beginning - that part was good and you saw the foreshadowing, and it made for a full circle of where Stargate began, but it wasn't enough to make this a \\"Wow\\".    Kudos to all the cast and writers.  It was a great program and it will be missed.  Sorry, not a fan of Atlantis.
031606792X|1.0|Apparently, Meyers thinks that getting married and pregnant by the age of 18 is a good message to send to young girls. I am aghast at why this series is so popular. The first three books were about an abusive boyfriend and unhealthy relationship, the now the last one shows that despite everything, it will all work out and everyone lives happily ever after. Meyers is a naive writer and a terrible role model.
1594489505|5.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Haled Hosseini is a book for both men and women who are caught up in the illusory struggle of gender dominance.  The book is extremely well written and I found it more moving than \\"The Kite Runner\\", which will always be one of my favorite books.<br /><br />Hosseini's style is relaxed and not complicated. He has an almost Hemingwayesque style in his presentation and reads very fast.  He includes cultural and Islamic words which broadens our experience and also lends to the authenticity of the overall experience.<br /><br />The book is about the human spirit both male and female and exposes the reader to the sometimes cruelty and joys of life in the Afghanistan culture.  Like Kite Runner it exposes you to the extremes of the Taliban way of life and the hijacking of a peaceful religion by radicals with a personal agenda. It also accents the tragedy of the male dominance at the expense of the women in this culture.<br /><br />As a political observation, it is hoped that the women who live in this oppressive environment will one day temper the apparent ugliness, to westerners, this culture demonstrates.
0385340990|5.0|\\"Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\\"<br />For me, this quote from one of the early letters (this one from Juliet to Dawsey) encapsulates the book's appeal.<br />The book comprises a series of letters written in 1946 between Juliet Ashton, her friends and publisher, and the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  There are some excellent and thorough reviews here on Amazon that will tell you the story and I commend their story-telling skills.  I am not one to read the typical summer or beach books, but it was such a review that drew me to the book (that \\"secret homing instinct\\" at work?)  The stories told are light and dark, interesting, sad, and charming, but be aware that at some points in the book you must simply suspend belief.  That said, the unlikeliness of certain acts and conditions doesn't really detract from the overall joy of this book.<br />As Juliet writes in the same letter quoted above, \\"That's what I love about reading:  one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you onto another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book.\\"  The Guernsey L and PPP Society will surely lead you on to other books (Catullus?  84 Charing Cross Road?  The Gathering Storm?).  I called this the perfect summer read, but I suspect I will still be following links from this book through the winter.  It's that good and it's that satisfying.
0380973839|5.0|I read the Martian Chronicles growing up in the early 70's.  Bradbury was on of my favorite authors.  The book does not disappoint if you love Sci Fi.  I purchased this book for my 18 yr old son.  He couldnt put the book down and read it through in 3 days.  Very unsual for him to stick with a book like that.  He raved about the book and is asking for Bradbury's other works.
1567184855|2.0|A good friend recommended this book to me and I ordered it in high anticipation of its arrival.  Unfortunately, as I read along, I found myself doubting the conclusions/opinions of the author regarding his clinical experience with a variety of patients and individuals.  In other words, the author did not supply any empirical evidence that his conclusions were correct.  Too much was left to the unproven veracity of the patients and his subjective opinion.    Otherwise, its not a bad read as it does open you up to a pretty comforting belief about death and the aftermath.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Stargate - The Ark of Truth  I was annoyed that issues had been left hanging at the end of the 10th year. At last all we fans have some closure after the abrupt end of the 10 year Stargate SG1 series.I really enjoyed the movie and the EXTRA big effects.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|The best thing about the Mamma Mia! movie (aside from the wonderful cast, lush setting, heartwarming scenes on family and friendship) are the wonderful songs of ABBA which have been recorded anew by Benny & Bjorn for the movie and is a marked improvement from the original ABBA versions. This is not to undermine the versions of ABBA which are classics in their own right but tracks like \\"Money, Money, Money\\" \\"Mamma Mia\\" \\"Super Trouper\\" \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" sound even better than the originals because the new recordings have been improved instrumentally while still maintaining the original arrangements. Of course, Meryl Streep's interpretation of \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" is a masterpeice in  vocal interpretation and is the movie's highlight. People can not imagine Meryl singing and some people even want to believe that someone dubbed her singing voice. But in my book, there isn't anything this great actress can not do. My favorite ABBA song, however, will always be \\"Dancing Queen\\" and the version in this soundtrack is even better than the original. I bought a 2-cd copy today of ABBA's No. 1s and was kinda disappointed that the tracks were not remastered to give better sound. I sure hope that the \\"Thank You For the Music\\" boxed set which I recently ordered at Amazon will sound better...  My only complaint about this CD is that some songs in the movie were not included like \\"Chiquitita\\" and the encore \\"Waterloo\\" plus \\"Thank You For the Music\\" is a hidden track and comes after \\"I Have a Dream\\" on Track 17.  There is also a track in this cd by Amanda Seyfried \\"Name of the Game\\" which was probably a deleted scene because it was not in the movie. Amanda Seyfried sounds really good and is truly a discovery. She was in \\"Mean Girls\\" and I think her career has been given a huge boost with this film and puts her ahead of co-stars Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams. Other ABBA songs which I discovered in this CD to be gems are \\"One Last Summer\\" and \\"When All is Said and Done.\\" Thiswill surely be one of my favorite musicals of all time.\\"Mamma Mia\\" is already no. 1 in Amazon's Top CDs and is ranked at No. 3 in Billboard's Top 200 albums this week and is the greatest gainer. No ABBA album ever reached this high on the Billboard chart before. The movie has also been doing well (inspite of mixed reviews) and had the biggest opening weekend ever for a musical (compared to Chicago, Dreamgirls, Sweeney)so it is on track to hit the $100 MM mark - not bad for a musical...Bravo to the cast!
031606792X|3.0|Okay - I'm not gonna lie, I've loved the Twilight series for three years. Three YEARS. I don't think it's deep or romantic or anything of that sort, but it's my guilty pleasure. So, as you can imagine, for the last year I'd been anxiously awaiting Aug 2 like it was the second coming. And then I read it.    ... The first 140 pages? Complete and TOTAL trash. trash, trash, trash. It was horribly written, had hideous analogies, and basically had me wanting to claw my eyes out.    Spoiler:  Are you KIDDING ME? \\"All those wonderful times we spent together? All those (3) conversations we've had with eachother? The first moment I knew I was in love with you? NONE OF THEM COMPAIR TO SEX. SEX. SEX. SEX.\\" And guess what? Surprise, Surprise. The Great Bella is late for her period. All of a sudden, Edward's love goes out the window and it's all about the little \\"nudger.\\"     Seriously, after Bella has his baby, she's like \\"Edward = good for sex. ONLY. and a bodyguard... I guess.\\"    Breaking Dawn did, however, warm up to Jacob during his POV. Until be became a pedophile, anyway.     While I did enjoy pages 143-650, pages 1-139 were trash, and I still have another hundred pages to go until I'm done, however, so I might be back to write another angry review.     PS. I do think Bella has a better personality AFTER she changes. And at least she got a new hobby other than thinking Edward is amazing, beautiful, perfect, a statue, perfect, gorgeous, a genuis, PERFECT. Who would've known it'd take a baby to drag any type of personality from bella.
0312360266|1.0|This book is a huge disappointment.  While it may sell well in the mass market, it can not be put in school libraries.  The sexual content alone sets this book up for censorship issues.
0143105035|5.0|i bought this edition of the book simply because i'm a total daniel clowes fanboy. i mean, the story itself is a classic, but i already own a less aesthetically appealing copy of it. this one was purely for the looks.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|If you like U2 and Pink Floyd, you will love ColdPlay.   Even though Viva La Vida and Violet Hill have been headlined as the best songs on the cd, overlooked are Lost and Lovers in Japan which to me are better than the former.   Life in Technicolor and Cemetaries in London are pretty good too. But my favorites are Lost and Lovers in Japan. Third and fourth are Viva La Vida and Violet Hill.   This is still a good buy.
031606792X|2.0|Once Upon a Time,<br /><br />Alright... I'm actually a little lost as to what I should say to be honest.  I really loved Twilight.  I liked New Moon, I fell for Jacob and Edward in Eclipse.  Breaking Dawn was a disappointment.  If you are looking for a fairytale ending here you go.  Have at it.  If you are looking for the real truth of true love, of pain, of sacrifice, of life just don't read this book.<br /><br />I repeat don't read this book.  Create your own ending, create your own pain and fantasy of the epic of Bella and Edward, of the sacrifice of Jacob.  For if you read this book you will be disgusted and creeped out a little on who Jacob imprints on.<br /><br />The plot was not as good as the first three books.  Bella did not grow up, she did not learn that anything worth having is hard to get and comes with a price.  Instead Meyer threw the pain and epic battles of the first three books out the window and implanted Bella with happiness and sparkles.<br /><br />I believe that every single reader expected differently of Meyer and I am sad to say she threw in the towel for this book.  It was as if she was so worried about pleasing everyone that she ended up pleasing no one.  Bella runs away with the entire cake and eats it too.  For all your fans who believe that this was a great book and ended perfectly I pity your lack of imagination and wish that Meyer treated us with another Twilight or another Host.<br /><br />The End (Is this where I say dreams do come true?)
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Shelter is an outstanding movie that reminds you that Love truly does exist! I recommend this movie to all!
B00000ADG2|5.0|This is what American music is...carved from her island style and fused with her street savvy, this album shines with everything Lauryn Hill was and is, and what she represents is an undying, unyielding spirit which recognizes the best and the worst of society and turns it into something to which everyone can relate.  With funky beats and sweet, sweet melodies!
0060899190|5.0|i really enjoyed looking at the creative postcards people sent in.  i gave this book to my friend and she loved it!!
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three books. I enjoyed them so much that I forgave Meyer for showing us that she understood virtually nothing about vampire myth, why it existed in the first place, or why certain things in the mythos are the way they are. I forgave the sparkling, the lack of fangs, and the lack of obvious bloodlust (minus Edward's obsession with Bella).    But this newest installment has gone too far. Meyer, for one, cannot separate her religious views from her characters anymore (something that was blissfully nice in the first three). The plot is cliched, unresearched, beyond cracked-out and beyond logical reasoning, and EVERYONE is out of character. Edward and Bella have lost all of their chemistry that made them such an \\"unconventional\\" couple--Meyer has sacrifced the pseudo innovativeness of the relationship to have it fit the schema of how SHE thinks life should work (character motivation be damned!)    Not to mention the butchering of poor Jacob. I never liked his character, but I can't help but feel that Meyer has shafted him most of all just for the sake of keeping him around. The power dynamic is GONE.    Can we just pretend that the Twilight saga ended at Eclipse?

B0019FOC5E|4.0|I don't admit this around many of my friends, but I'm an Abba fan. It all began in the late 70's. I was deeply interested in New Wave and Punk Rock music and couldn't seem to get enough. Then, for some totally unfathomable reason, I bought a compilation album of Abba's \\"Greatest Hits.\\" Listening to Abba was considered uncool, but their songs were wonderful and that album has had a lot of play over the years. Every song on the record was outstanding and could be so \\"catchy\\" that you'd have it in your head for hours thereafter. When I was in the right mood, the Abba \\"Greatest Hits\\" album provided wonderful uplifting music.<br /><br />More recently, I noted that the movie \\"Mamma Mia\\" was playing at the local theaters. Well, this is one I just had to see. In short, the movie was wonderful. Joyous. Simply outstanding. In my theater the audience applauded at the conclusion of the film and I don't experience that at many movies. The movie was a musical, of course, based on a collection of Abba songs. \\"Mamma Mia,\\" \\"Waterloo,\\" \\"SOS,\\" \\"Honey Honey,\\" \\"Dancing Queen,\\" \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" and a host of others were woven into a somewhat lightweight story of a wedding taking place on a Greek Isle. The story was OK, even touching in places, and the cast was excellent, but the main star of the movie was the Abba music.<br /><br />The cast did a reasonably good job of presenting the music, difficult though that must have been. I grimaced at a few of the songs, but some were outstanding. In evaluation, I'd say the soundtrack CD is rather good, but it just can't mark up to the real Abba. I'd much rather listen to a good Abba compilation album, such as my \\"Greatest Hits,\\" than listen to the soundtrack album of this very fine movie. However, it's a good album, without question, and it presents a wonderful selection of songs. I'd suggest that the average listener might wait until the movie DVD is out and purchase the soundtrack in this way. One of the reasons the movie is so good is because of the cast, the dancing and the scenic backdrop. Without these additions the music itself just doesn't mark up to the real Abba.<br /><br />Gary Peterson, the dancing and the scenic backdrop. Without these additions the music itself just doesn't mark up to the real Abba.    Gary Peterson

B000YABIQ6|5.0|It's no wonder this show is getting so much attention; there's nothing else like it on TV, nor has there been in quite some time.  Somebody is doing a fantastic job of art direction, re-creating 1960 right down to the last detail--and let's not forget all those drinks and cigarettes!      They are also right on the money with the frustrated housewives and their unfaithful, dissatisfied husbands; the alpha male world of advertising executives; the barely contained sexual energy of the women who work as their secretaries.      Jon Hamm is spot-on as Donald Draper, the creative director with the seemingly perfect life but a questionable past that he wants to leave behind but cannot; Elisabeth Moss is admirable as his secretary, Peggy, who looks like a pig-tailed school girl but has a tough and secretive side that is slowly revealed.       The actors portraying Betty Draper, Peter Campbell (who knew that a smarmy little buggar could be a cad at the same time?), Roger Sterling, Burt Cooper, and others are an equal match for Hamm and Moss.  All of the work from the cast and crew has paid off in a big and well-deserved way.
B00004W510|5.0|Well..i've never written a review on AMZN before.  I am an absolute music afficianado and am a Grateful Dead fanatic.  I would say that I have in my collection every single important 60's and 70's albums created (from Zep, Beatles, Floyd, all Dylan, Stones, Who, Allmans, Neil, Hendrix, Dead, and the zillion other important contributions worldwide).    THIS ALBUM BLOWS THEM ALL AWAY!    It is without question the most impressive studio album ever recorded and should be a part of any and all music fans collection.  Most people know very little about the members of this group and their importance to the music industry.  While R.Robertson gets the credit for most of their work.....this band MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER is truly A BAND effort.  Levon Helm is simply put one of the finest southern singers ever.  R.Manuel's voice is the most hauntingly beautiful male vocal ever heard.  Period.  Bar none.  The musical genius of G.Hudson and Danko's sick bass lines are legendary.    I cannot say enuf good things here.  From start to finish, this album will blow you away.  Obviously, the timeless classics we all know, like \\"Dixie\\" and \\"Cripple Creek\\" deserve their Hall of Fame mention.  But the remaining tracks are what make this album the king of all albums.    \\"King Harvest\\" is basically the beginning of funk country americana rock and just blisters your ears off.  I LOVE the added \\"Get Up Jake\\" bonus track (my vote for best bonus track on any remastered album ever).  It's really a waste of time to comment on individual songs as I really believe this album is the most consistent, start-to-finish 'rock' album of all time.  Period.  It's kind of amusing that Crosby, Stills and Nash and/or Simon/garfunkel are always regarded as the best male harmonies put on vinyl.  Try getting LEVON HELM, RICHARD MANUEL and RICK DANKO in their prime!!  The beautiful 3 vocalists stack their throaty sound on this album like nothing ever heard before.      AGAIN....THIS ALBUM SHOULD BE #1 on anyone's list.  Period.  When might you ask was this album made?  Could be 1850, could be 1920, could be 1970.  It is truly a timeless classic.  It is the Wuthering Heights or To Kill a Mockingbird of the music industry.    BUY NOW without hesitation and listen to this album over and over.  It takes months if not years to really HERE what this amazing group of musicians has created.  Once you have mastered this one, add Music From Big Pink for an earlier, more 60's sounding masterpiece as well.  Chest Fever will blow a hole right thru you.
031606792X|5.0|This contains spoilers....You've been warned.      I have to be honest, I hated the book and was wondering \\"why the heck am I staying up to read this.\\"    But I think she delivered the \\"happily ever after\\" ending that I (and many other Twilight fans) was looking for.    Let's be honest, Edward and Bella's relationship has been something of a fairy tale from the start. It's perfect and pure and for the books sake runs deeper than any human bond.  So why doesn't it make sense that everything works out perfectly in the end?  It's how it was meant to be.    And as for the \\"message\\" we're worried about sending young women. I mean come on people. It's a book. Just because I am a huge Harry Potter fan doesn't mean that I go running around wielding a wand and trying to kill everyone who likes snakes.    It's a book. Get over it.

159562015X|3.0|I purchased Strengthsfinder 2.0 upon the recommendation of Cristina Favreau. Although I usually enjoy doing assessments and learning more about myself, I was not overly impressed with this one.<br /><br />For starters, it's hard to comprehend the value in a question that asks \\"Would you rather read a book or eat an apple?\\" (This is not a real question, but an illustration of the type of unrelated things you're asked to choose between in some cases.)<br /><br />In addition, I think it should be possible to purchase additional access codes without having to buy more copies of the book. It's not just about the cost of the book (not to mention shipping), but in this age of environmental consciousness, no one should have to buy a book in order to access an online service, especially if they already own a copy.<br /><br />Although the results were interesting, I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of direction as to how to make use of them. Fortunately, when I posted a comment to that effect on Cristina's blog, Lara, The Data Digger was kind enough to point me to \\"Sort Your Life into Place! The Strengths Card Sort,\\" a blog post by Margaret Greenberg, which helped me take it a step further.
B0010X745K|3.0|If you can overlook the usual bone-headed caricatures of people reacting to an invasion of mist-shrouded monsters, then this is a fun, exciting treat. And that ending alone elevates this flick way above the usual genre movies that parade under the guise of 'horror.' When customers at a general store discover that there are some terrifying monsters on the loose, then they all react in different ways.<br /><br />Probably the most hysterical character is the black man, portrayed by Andre Braugher, who, for no reason at all, goes into a major hissy fit about racism when hero Thomas Jane, and others, try to persuade him to go with them to the rear of the store, to see for himself that there are evil creatures out there in the mist. He has been the major doubter that there is anything supernatural about the mist, although he has seen for himself the deaths of several customers.<br /><br />He bulges his eyes, stomps his feet and thunders out a lecture about hwo they're treating him like a moran because of his race. You keep wondering: what planet is this creep on? Everyone in the store is in danger of being slaughtered by the creepy monsters and here's this guy shrieking about being treated as a lower-grade of human. Strangely, when he and some others go out into the mist to seek safety, we're never told of their fates. Were they eaten alive?<br /><br />Another approach that highly irritated me was the oozing love and affection and protection shown to Thomas Jane's son. The kid is treated like this rare and delicate blossom who must never be left alone. Thomas Jane, by the way, was perfectly cast. He's strong, convincing and sympathetic.<br /><br />The ending is one of the most unforgettable in sci-fi/horror film history. I won't divulge anything about it but when you see it, your heart just drops. When I saw this in a theater, everyone in the audience filed out, discussing the ending and several people saying, \\"Oh, my God, I can't believe it!\\"
031606792X|1.0|I am a massive Twilight fan. I loved the first three books and I lost myself completely in each of them.    I was very excited for Breaking Dawn because I didn't know what to expect. The story line could be anything and I had high hopes that Stephenie would make it as interesting as ever.    (Warning: Spoilers ahead.)    The first \\"book\\" was okay at the beginning. It seemed normal: Bella nervous for her wedding, a nice little wedding, and then the honeymoon. I expected that much. However, then I got to the end of the first part. If you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about.    I actually put down the book and said, \\"No way...what is this? Fanfiction?\\" It took me awhile to pick it up again. And then I had to read from Jacob's POV, which annoyed me since the massive plot line mostly involved Bella. I was so confused: what was I reading? Was this even Stephenie writing anymore? Why did the voice of the book suddenly change? Why were the characters saying things that seemed out of place?    The plot line was messed up, to put it simply. A child? Stephenie said that it was impossible! I read so many fanfiction stories with that plot line and always stopped reading them because it annoyed me. And here was the REAL book with that plot line I loathed the most.    Everyone suddenly seemed out of character. Bella wasn't herself, Edward was saying things that made me question out loud, and everything was changing. And then Jacob - what can I say about him? I was beginning to like him and then throw in that imprinting thing and it's all out of the window!    I'm frustrated. I wanted to see a big epic battle at the end of the book, not just...nothing.     I didn't expect anything. But it still ruined my nonexistant expections. Breaking Dawn has a different feel to it than the other books. I don't believe it's part of the series.    I'm just so disappointed. Why Stephenie?
0156030209|5.0|This book is simply incredible.  It felt like I was reading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" all over again.  Martel weaves a beautiful tale that asks the reader to suspend disbelief for a while and delivers a classic in taking that risk.  This book stays with the reader long after it is placed down.
031606792X|1.0|This book was a poor imitation of the worst fanfiction. NONE of the aspects of the novel were redeeming including but not limited to--plot, character development, themes, morality, and overall message. The book was contrived from the exorcist-reminiscent Bella to the pathetic excuses for baby names. The book turned the series into a farce! Unlike the rest of the series, was plot driven with out any insight from the characters--leaving the reader with a one sided point of view. The baby seemed to slowly and parasitically brainwash all of the characters--ultimately, causing tasteless religious devotion as well as disturbing pedophilic undertones. Because the characters, plot, and themes  were so alien and unrecognizable the reader was left disappointed and confused.
0930289234|5.0|This was one of the best graphic novels I have read.  I was recommended this by a friend and I was not disappointed.  Very serious subject matter that is written so well it could be a novel itself.  The artwork just adds to the great subject matter.  After every chapter, I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.
031606792X|2.0|I've made it no secret to my friends, both in real life and over the internet, of my pure contempt for this series, and yet I read on. Was it because I was completely bewildered that a romance series had a thinly veiled abusive relationship and not enough characterization between the leads to fill a teaspoon? Or was it because beyond all that I was mildly interested in the plotline, and wanted to see how she would escape out of the corner she wrote herself into?    I'm honestly unsure, but I can say that I had one of my queries answered. I've said it before and I'll repeat it here, her own limitations, forcing her to try and write a fairy tale romance that never was, would be the death of her work. She is completely dedicated to giving her characters everything while costing them nothing. She just doesn't comprehend the idea of literary sacrifice nor does she seem to grasp how when one has one's every wish, one can never be happy.    Yes, the series contained mostly drivel but if she had spent the time and effort, a best-selling author should have, she could have mildly salvaged the series. Instead she attempted to turn out 700 pages in one year, and still make readable, a goal in which she failed. I think what shocks me the most, was that on some level I did hope she would finish the series that the fanfare for it deserved.    She did escape from that corner however, by completely ignoring her own cannon and running amuck with what she ever had. I just have to say this, never have I come across an author who would so blatantly ignore rules they already placed in their world. Her total dedication to trying to please as many people as possible, and to trying to end the series using clues she already had that didn't add up, led her to practically assassinating characters that already where an inch form literary death.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Fantastic movie!  One I've seen over and over and never tire watching.  Richard Gere is handsome, sweet and caring.  Julia Roberts plays a hardworking, beautiful and selfless woman.  Great cast and wonderful plot.  Definitely a movie that will go down in history as one of the best!  Highly recommended.
0439813786|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. The story line was interesting and the sketches worked so well at telling the story. It is like a picture book for the YA crowd. I must confess that my husband and I enjoyed it as much as our 14 year old!
067942850X|5.0|Excellent book, one of the best I have read in a long time.  Krakauer's vivid descriptions allow one to feel as though (s)he is walking right along in the wilderness with Chris McCandless.  The dialogue between Chris and the folks he meets helps one obtain a better insight into his frame of mind, almost like reading his diary.  I found it sad yet understandable how a young man could embark on such a life-altering jouney that would unfortunately end in tragedy.  Highly recommended read!!!
006135323X|5.0|I have already recommended this book to my upper-level students in international relations courses.  There is a longstanding debate in the field of IR (and throughout the social sciences) about whether it is more useful to take the \\"rational choice\\" approach of economics that attempts to predict behavior using formal mathematical models such as game theory and expected utility, or to use the evidence-based scientific approach of sociology and psychology that carefully examines actual behavior in an effort to figure out why people (and nations) behave the way they do.  Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses.  Neither is perfect.  It would be wonderful if we could combine the best of both worlds: the simplicity and predictive power of economics with the rigorous empirical grounding of the scientific method.  The emerging field of \\"behavioral economics\\" is an attempt to do just that.  It takes the basic principles of economic modeling and adjusts them based on scientific discoveries about human behavior.  Ariely's book is a great non-technical introduction to behavioral economics.  Written for the lay-reader with no background in economics or psychology,  this book explains, in simple, easy-to-understand terms, why people don't behave rationally, as economists like to assume they do.  It's really a book about decision making.  It asks the question of how people make decisions, and why they make the (often irrational) decisions they make.  This is a fun book that touches on everything from marketing to finance to international relations to health care to sex.  (Yes, believe it or not, people even make irrational decisions about sex; and sexual desire can interfere with our ability to think rationally.)  If you've ever wondered why people often make irrational decisions, this is the book for you.  And I'd especially recommend this book for all students of economics as a prophylactic against the field's rather irrational assumption that rational choice can explaineverything.
031606792X|1.0|The Twilight series has never been great-- it's been sloppily-written, almost plot-less, and incredibly cheesy-- but it's been a guilty pleasure. Or at least the first book was. New Moon was bad, Eclipse was worse, and now Breaking Dawn is the cherry on top of the really horrible sundae. It rapidly goes from unintentionally hilarious, to awful, to leaving the reader wondering how it ever got published.     Stephenie Meyer's writing has gotten even worse, and the 'morals' in her stories are getting more and more disturbing. What's more, she still can't even back it up with any solid plot (as usual, the first sign of one comes at about page 600 and it ends up being an anticlimax).     In fact, there is not enough plot in the entire series to fill a 768-page book, so one does wonder if Breaking Dawn's editor was out to lunch and/or missing their handy red pen.     To say this book is terrible would be an understatement. I only wish I could give it less than one star.
031606792X|1.0|This book just makes me laugh at how bad it is. I won't say anything else because all the bad points have been covered already.....BUT...........  HOW THE HELL IS THIS BOOK INSPIRED BY A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM?!?!?!
B0017HRCQU|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sons, who are Batman fans, and they totally enjoyed it!  Everything that is included in it is well worth the price I paid for it.
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|I saw this one in the theater when I was a little girl. I wasn't always sure what was happening (between the adults) but now that I do I can watch this one, easily, once a month. The story and the scenery in Africa are unsurpassed. The actors need no introduction to most viewers and the young ones who don't know them are in for a treat. This movie would be a fine, \\"How do you do\\".
B00005JPLW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!  It's like Shakespearean drama meets comic book style and the results are amazing.  I don't go to the theater much (people with little kids and cell phones drive me nuts) but I dragged my husband to this one.  It's the kind of movie that needs the big screen...not that I mind watching it 500 times on Cinemax, as I'm doing right now.  I think it gets better each time I watch.  Is it historically accurate?  WHO CARES???  I read the passage in Herodotus that describes the situation and some of it actually is accurate, but it doesn't matter. (Ex.: He describes Xerxes as \\"effeminate, extravagant and cruel\\".) You want accuracy, go watch the History Channel.  This is an action film at its best, and it has something for everyone.  The actors give their all, and the look of the film is like nothing I've ever seen. I think the critics who didn't like it had their heads up their a$$.  I can't wait for Zach Snyder's next film.    And, I have to say, GREAT butt, Gerry!!  :-)
1596680199|5.0|Adorei, muito didático, conteúdo bem explicado, com ótimas sugestões e idéias, bom gosto. Altamente recomendado.
031606792X|1.0|As a stand alone book, this would've made fine fan-fic on a message board somewhere.  As an ending to an otherwise amazing series, it's horrible.  This book does not follow in the same thread or tone of the other books, and most things that the reader is lead to believe as fact the author chose to change to fit into her so called story line.  Total 180 from the other books.  I can't help but wonder if she was forced to write an ongoing series, and struggled to come up with ideas?  What started as an amazing series has crashed and burned. She has much talent as a storyteller, but I think she writes much better with only one book - Twilight and The Host are very enjoyable reads. If she has to continue her stories into a series, she seems to struggle.    Stephenie Meyer definately jumped the shark on this one.
B00168HARG|5.0|Well, i recieved my copy of Terminator season 1...... 3 weeks early on august 1st...i was only able to see one of the episodes when first run on tv...but am a big fan of the movies...have all of them on either hd dvd or bluray......ok...the review of the newest terminator to bluray....well after watching the whole series straight through....it's the best sci-fi on tv...great production......widescreen filmed and great sound...almost movie level special effects.....and the bluray totally shines....i'm talking picture quality 4.5-5 stars out of 5...and the sound quality not far behind at a solid 4 stars....if your a fan of the series so far..it's a must buy...if your wanting to watch the series...i give a strong recommend.....great upgrade with bluray!!!!!!
067003830X|5.0|02/Aug/2008    Now, this is marvellous book - relevant and interesting to me in my work as a professional Coach & Supervisor since 1985 ... It's a real must read :-) !    Claus B. Hansen
031606792X|2.0|Ok I was fine with the book till the whole baby idea. That was just pushing the envelope way to far in my opinion. Almost everything else was passable in my mind but seriously A baby? I mean come on!! I think Eclipse should have ended the series. The only part I REALLY enjoyed was the wedding...
B000002ITM|5.0|Where the previous album, \\"Souls of Black\\" was a little bit rushed and poorly produced, The Ritual put the band Testament back in form at the level of their previous album.<br /><br />The album also sees the band changing their sound a little bit, slowing the tempo down.  Return to Serenity is much like Testament's version of the Clansman (or maybe the other way around as it came first) and is an awesome song with great guitar work, Electric Crown is the band's version of You've Got Another Coming, songs like So Many Lies and The Ritual show the band experiementing with slower but still heavy sounds.<br /><br />Only downside is nothing on this album is as fast as the pace of the previous four albums.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|This is her best work since Jagged Little Pill.  Some her latest stuff has been a little weird, but not this one.  It is great!
B000002IMG|5.0|This is another solid offering from Testament, and is good from the start to the end.<br /><br />While I list the Legacy as the best thrash metal album ever, the New Order is literally every bit as good, it's just the Legacy was the bands defining album as it came first.<br /><br />The album did not sell too well for the band, possibly because MTV was too big on Metallica, Guns N Roses and Motley Crue to promote bands like Testament, certainly not because the album is lacking in material.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|I have to say I LOVED the first Step Up its been on high rotation since it came out, I would have watched it at least 100 times!!!! So when I heard there was a sequal coming out I was fearful it wouldn't hold up to the first but I must say I shouldn't have worried I think I LOVE it even more! Channing's still in it, (his co-star from She's the Man) Robert's the new leading man and theres more dancing then the original. What else could you ask for?
B000002IOJ|5.0|Testament may not have invented thrash metal; nor be the most highly recognised name among thrash metal (perhaps depending if you count bands that don't play thrash metal anymore or not), but they are still the best thrash metal band, and even their worst albums put Metallica or most other bands' best to shame.<br /><br />This is another solid offering from Testament, and is good from the start to the end.
1416550518|5.0|Just a few impressions since many reviewers have covered plot details.  This is just one of those books.  There are lots of romantic tragedies out there.  And a great many of them can make you cry.  But this one breaks your heart and gets into your head.  The characters are finally drawn, amazingly come to life, and you won't come across a finer rendition of a time and place in history.  In many ways, it reminded me of the movie The English Patient, a set of love stories that just speaks on so many levels--what it means to love and be loved, but also what it means to be happy and to live a life worth living.  I have no doubt I will be rereading The House at Riverton in years to come.
B000002J0G|5.0|This album saw Testament experiment a little with death metal, and contained some of their heaviest material to date.<br /><br />While Low, Legions (In Hiding), Hail Mary, Shades of War, PC, Dogs Faced Gods, and Ride are all great headbangers, Urotsukidoji shows some great interplay between Greg Christian and the rest of the band, leading into Chasing Fear which is the most typical old school Testament song on the album, and probably the only time on the album I missed Alex Skolnick (as good as Skolnick is, James Murphy certainly was a worthy replacement).<br /><br />However the slow song on this album, Trail of Tears, similar to Return to Serenity on The Ritual, wins the gold for the best song on the album.  The song contains the albums best solo (and one of my all-time favorite solos ever) from... surprising Eric Peterson.  James Murphy's solo was good too, but Eric's was outstanding.  People always overlook Eric Peterson's ability as a guitarist because of talent he has had around him, but if you ask me, he should solo more.
031606792X|5.0|I just recently got into Twilight a couple of months ago and I was really surprised by how I was drawn into the story and the characters. That being said I was really looking forward to Breaking Dawn and I admit I looked at the spoilers LOL couldn't help my self. At first I was a little put off but when I read the entire book, I have to say I was really surprised by how good it was. Stephanie really drew me in like she did with the other books and blew me away. Definitly a great read!
B000002IPZ|4.0|First, the production was pretty bad (as it was on most early Testament albums, but this was thhe worst), meaning it's hard to feel the energy of the songs.<br /><br />Second, this was their first album that was not solid from start to finish.  You could play The Legacy, The New Order, or Practice What You Preach from start to finish and there was not a weak song or filler on the album, where Souls of Black is plagued by fillers.<br /><br />Souls of Black, Face In The Sky and The Legacy are all top-notch songs from the band worthy of their first three albums.  The problem is the rest of the album isn't as memoriable.<br /><br />Still not a bad album by any means.
031606792X|5.0|True to form, Meyer surprises us with a few twists in this final book. I walked away happy, and I think most readers will too. This saga definitely wrapped up with somthing making everyone happy!
B0012E6R3W|5.0|It's like The Gathering meets The Legacy, or perhaps what the Gathering would have been with Alex Skolnick.<br /><br />Either way this album thrashes like mad and puts the bands talent to full use.<br /><br />The Henchmen Ride and More Than Meet The Eye are certainly not only among the best from Testament ever, but the best songs in the thrash metal genre to date.
031606792X|1.0|I guess after hitting the New York Times that many authors lose their way and decide to take \\"different directions.\\" Sometimes it works, most often it does not. BD does not work.<br /><br />Most of us know that Bella Swan, the so-called heroine of the Twilight series, is clumsy, spineless, and has no idea how to put two coherent thoughts together without one of them involving her vampire boyfriend, Edward Cullen, but to completely rip out what little shred of intelligence she had in the first place all for the sake of tying up lose ends and keeping everyone happy is not an effective way to end the series. Bella pouts and bemoans and gets angry, but she takes no action when it comes to those situations that make her pout, bemoan, and get angry in the first place. She lives completely in the WWED-- What Would Edward Do? world.<br /><br />I agree with a reviewer who said that the message is sent out that the only way for a girl to find happiness is to have a significant other (I shudder to call Edward significant), get married, and have babies. Meyer had stated that vampires couldn't have babies, and yet Bella gives birth to a daughter, Nessie (again, Meyer, REALLY?!). I suppose since Bella is such a special person that anything is possible for her.<br /><br />But the thing which irritated me the most is how she presented Jacob. I was all for Jacob to end up with her, undeserving as she is, and Meyer reduces him to a whiny, convenient plot device for Bella's child. It's as if she had Jacob think, \\"If I can't have Bella, then at least there's her kid.\\" The fact that Nessie ages rapidly, to make it okay for Jacob to imprint on her is a cop out and a disturbing element--now he's a pedophile? How wonderful.<br /><br />Needless to say, I am glad Meyer is done with this series because I am done as well. It was a good run while it lasted, but the ending I could have done without. Goodbye, Forks. Goodbye, characters and bad story, I am off to blue waters.
B000002IKR|5.0|The title says it all.<br /><br />Not the greatest production, but the albums content more than makes up for it.  Thhe songs are well written, fast and aggressive yet melodic and energetic, excellent guitar work between Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick and solos to raise demons from the abyss.
B000OCZ0ZO|5.0|i love this DVD/CD. i got it autographed at SURU in Los Angeles. i love Linkin Park, and unlike some other people that say they are true fans, i like the risks they are taking and the new sounds that they are creating. ;)
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Probably one of the top 30 greatest films of all time. Stephen King made one little error though. Andy (Tim Robbins), a smart banker, would not have spoken to the warden (who couldn't do anything legally) about his newly discovered witness to prove that he is innocent. Andy would have gone straight to his lawyer who could have re-opened the case.
031606792X|5.0|First off, all the spoilers, if you think about it...she knew what she was writing and she left many different loop holes while answering questions so that you can not sit there and say \\"She lied to us! She said it was impossible!\\"     Many people have said it seems like a glorified fanfic but isn't that what every writer is? They love their story lines and plot twists that they make it how they want it to be? I honestly did read some of the spoilers and thought \\"what?!?!\\" However, after reviewing those chapters and then reading the book, it really is a good story if you let your guard down. Many of you have these plot lines you WANT in the book but that isn't how SM planned it. I liked how the characters continued to develop and grow and how it shows that the bonds of friendship and family know no bounds and that justice will prevail in the proof of innocence.     If you do not want to have plot twists, impossible occurring (hello...this is written about vampires and werewolves and you yell about something else being impossible?) then don't read it. However, if you enjoy such things and character development and love conquering all...then I highly recommend this book
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I was excited when I heard about this movie, but I was really let down.  There are so many more accurate and well made movies about this topic! I LOVE Tudor and Elizabethan history, but this movie was misleading and not even well done.  They managed to make an extremely long movie that was hard to sit through AND rush through many parts that could have made it more interesting??  I agree that Anne of 1000 Days is a better choice. I also enjoyed the BBC mini-series on the wives of Henry.  My 15 year old daughter and I agreed that this movie was boring and a disappointment!
B000E1MTZE|5.0|The price on the Matrix Trilogy on HD DVD is so much cheaper than the $90 people will shell out for Blu-ray if they don't have a combo unit or HD DVD player. As for myself, I bought this box set for the unbelieveable price of $27!! The first one will always remain the best though \\"Reloaded\\" boasts a thrilling freeway chase scene and the late Gloria Foster in her last role as the Oracle (Mary Alice would replace her in \\"Revolutions\\").  As for the last film, I found it pretty boring and it's a sad finale for this great series but at $27 and in HD--who's complaining?
B000VBJEEG|5.0|It starts with a mouse colony that steals trash. Remy, the main character, doesn't like it and decides he wants to be a chef. He goes to a world famous restaurant, and secretly starts to train the garbage boy to cook. But what no one else one in the restaurant knows is its really Remy making the recipes. It's very cute and good for the whole family. One you'll want to watch over and over again!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|My son is 3 years old and he loves this pool.  He is a big kid, he wears a size 5T, just so you know, but he cannot use the slide.  Actually, my 20-pound baby daughter also cannot use the slide.  It is pretty much worthless, so don't buy it for that.  It can't hold up even a baby, and even if it could, it's plastic so it isn't slippery even with water on it.  However, the rest of the pool is very nice, and I like that it has a little square section that you can have a little more shallow for a younger one.  She's kind of protected in there from the splashings of the older one.  It's a relatively large pool for a kiddie pool, too.  And it's very nice that it also can be a sprinkler if you want.  You blow up the sides with air, and you can just leave it that way or you can add a hose and the outer walls become sprinklers.  All in all, it's a very nice pool and we're happy with it.  The palm tree actually stands up pretty well too.  Just make sure to point the leaves down instead of up, that helps it stand.
031606792X|1.0|Stephanie Meyer was never a good writer. Has anybody read her rough draft for Midnight Sun? In one part she uses the word would 15 times in 4 paragraphs, and she never met an adverb she didn't like. A talented writer will try to use 10 or less adverbs in an entire novel. She will use 15 in a single chapter. Yet, despite her short-comings, she does have a vivid imagination, and was able to create a plot and characters that are beloved by her fans. It is unfortunate that she chose to sell out their faith in her by creating a plot that contradicts almost everything she created before. I believe part of the problem is Meyer's desire to become a writer of adult fiction. Her writing style is better suited to the young adult market. She should embrace her position as a best-selling young adult author rather than trying to introduce adult themes into her juvenile book. J.K. Rowling managed to bring adult themes into her books without alienating her previous fans and target audience. Meyer's has failed in her attempt to do so. If she wants to do her fans a favor, she should give up on the idea of writing more Vampire fiction, or at least more with the Twilight characters, and create a new series from scratch, only this time, returning to her young-adult roots. I feel bad for all the fans of this series who were subjected to a book that was rushed and poorly edited. As Clint Eastwood says in Magnum Force, \\"A Man's got to know his limitations.\\" Stephanie Meyers tried to rise above her limitations and failed.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I feel forced to write about seeing \\"Cars\\" for the first time in Blu-ray.     I have a five-year old named Benicio. \\"Cars\\" was his first experience in a real movie theater. On DVD, he used to watch it several times a day; it was basically background to his daily activities running around playing at home.  He knows the movie intimately, and since he knows how to use the remotes, actually maneuvers around the film at will.    Well, I was recuperating from surgery, and I plopped this disc into my new Blu-ray player the afternoon after my hernia repair. Ben plopped down right next to me, seeing the disc case, asking, \\"Are you going to watch \\"Cars\\"? Can I watch it with you?\\"    The movie loaded and unspooled, and you would have thought he had never seen it before.  Was it the three-dimensional, hypnotizing, hyper-real images? Was it the completely enveloping audio mix?  Who knows? But let me tell you WHATEVER it was, it worked magic on my little guy. He got back into the movie as if it was a totally new experience.    Now as a father who probably could lip-synch the movie if pressed, I have to tell you the same exact thing happened to me. I was lost in this \\"Cars\\" world. The picture was crystalline; the audio pure.    What an extraordinary experience for a film buff! I felt a true sense of rediscovery. Details, in-jokes, audio subtleties...\\"Freebird\\" indeed.    Anyone who owns a Blu-ray player should have a copy of this already on their shelf.
031606792X|1.0|There are many, many things that bothered me about this book. Characterization, coherent plot, quality of writing - all the little things that are generally key to ensuring a book's success - were lacking in Meyer's latest attempt.    I'm wondering how her publisher could have allowed this book to reach the shelves as is. Perhaps I'm just being naive, but I believe that the powers that be should have done something, regardless of how much money they believed they would make. (Though based on the many cries of \\"I'm canceling my order!!\\" maybe they won't be making as much money as they thought.)     J.K. Rowling had a much larger fan base and a massively more intricate literary world to maintain, and I believe she handled it with grace and style right up until the seventh book.    What is Stephenie's excuse?
B0016Q56C4|2.0|The good: Lots of great effects and exciting scenes. I saw this in 2D, but lots of coming-at-you scenes must have worked beautifully in 3D projection.<br /><br />The bad: pretty much everything else. The story's logic faltered in just too many places. And, for a movie about a scientist, they got way too much of the science horribly wrong. Magnesium never occurs in metallic form in nature because it's so reactive, birds didn't exist 150 million years ago, and, well, lots more. And, despite his best effort to shake it off, Fraser's [[ASIN:6304711867 George of the Jungle]] seems to stand behind every attempt at a dramatic scene. If you want mindless excitement, great, but make sure you understand just how mindless.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0375703764|3.0|I heard a lot of people declare this book the scariest thing they'd ever read, and as a fan of horror - particularly of evil architecture - I was interested. I was sort of surprised to find that to me, anyway, this novel read a lot more like a moderately amusing, if quite tedious at times, satire on the academic ivory tower.     I think this book has the skeleton of a really terrifying horror story; I'd love to see The Navidson Record or read a novelization of it. Even so, given the way House of Leaves is written, I can't see it as scary in the least. I was an English major for far too many years and actually quite enjoy reading analytical articles, but it's not the same as reading the actual work. I know a lot of people who think The Haunting of Hill House is frightening, but I've never heard of anyone who woke up in a cold sweat because they read a critical analysis of the story. I think the essence of horror is getting the reader so engrossed in the story that they forget it's a story at all, but House of Leaves goes to great lengths to ensure that you never get drawn into the action for too long at a time; every time the summary of The Navidson Record starts to build up tension, it ends up getting diffused by a digression into the mythology of echoes and an analysis of their use in the story or some such thing. Even when Zampano, the writer, doesn't interrupt the flow, the editor Johnny will see fit to insert a 2-3 page footnote about his paranoia and nightmares and graphic sexual encounters. While Johnny's story was probably intended to be unnerving as well, I found it extremely repetitive and rarely effective. On top of everything else, we are told right off the bat that The Navidson Record doesn't actually exist (and even if it did, the blind Zampano couldn't have seen it anyway) and are reminded of this several times throughout the story.     At first House of Leaves got on my nerves because I felt it was trying entirely too hard; it's difficult to take a book seriously when it's doing the equivalent of jumping up and down, flapping its covers and shouting \\"Look at me! See how postmodern I am? Watch me deconstruct myself!\\" Eventually, though, I realized that it worked beautifully as satire on the academic world - given that The Navidson Record does not actually exist within the novel, we can see that Zampano didn't even bother to write his story; he evidently felt that analyzing a work was more important than actually producing it in the first place. The painstakingly cited references are all made up to suit the writer's convenience, as are the quotes themselves; difficult passages tend to be conveniently lost. The editor is hardly qualified for the job; in fact, he's frequently high and has a tendency to take Zampano's work and subvert it into his own autobiographical ramblings. Then, of course, there's the fact that this is obviously the type of novel to get a lot of scholarship; Danielewski has it set up so that actual academics will be writing actual articles about an article with a made-up premise and forged references. All these potshots at academia are actually really funny when you think about it, and it made the whole thing click for me fairly well. There are still parts that go on too long, and I could have done without the last hundred pages (aside from maybe the letters from Johnny's mother), but the work felt much more cohesive and much more enjoyable from that perspective.     I still think House of Leaves is a fairly impressive example of postmodern incoherency, but like most entries in the genre, it certainly lends itself to interpretation if you care to do so. The Navidson Record events are some of the most wonderfully evocative horror sequences I've read in a very long time, and like I said, if it were a separate work, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. I'm content to just borrow House of Leaves.
031606792X|3.0|I am in love with the Twilight series and have been eagerly awaiting Breaking Dawn's arrival for months.  I went to a midnight release, raced home, and read for hours before I reluctantly put my book away so I could get some sleep.  After waking up way early, I rushed to finish the book because I couldn't wait to see how my beloved series finally ends.    And I am going to be honest with you, this book was not at all what I was expecting.  The events in the book were utterly bizarre and reading this book had almost a dream-like feel and I was actually not sure if what I was reading was actually the book I had waited all this time for.  Breaking Dawn was nothing like I expected.  No where in my wildest imagination did I imagine that this book would turn out the way it did.  It was like Stephenie Meyer took everything that fans might be expecting and did the exact opposite, most strange thing she could think of.    I can't say I didn't like it because I feel like I had so much invested emotionally in the characters already, but I finished the book feeling confused and almost angry.  I was happy with it I guess, I just felt like it was so out of tune with the other three books that it almost didn't make any sense at all.  Like it was a completely other book just using the same character names.    I don't want my money back and I don't want to burn my book, but I just can't get over my shock with the way it turned out.  I just didn't know that reading a book could make me feel like I was on an acid trip.    *Edited to say that I am reading it a second time and like it better this time around.  Now that I am over the initial shock of the events that transpired, I find that I can appreciate it for what it is more than I could the first time.  I still rate it three stars, and I do that to rate it in comparison to how well I liked it next to the other three books.
0061150142|5.0|I started with Picoult on My Sister's Keeper which had me hooked and wanting more. I read a few of the others (Nineteen Minutes, Mercy) but didnt find the satisfaction that I did with Sister's Keeper, then I read about this one and immediatley wanted to read it! I couldnt put it down! I have to say that I was a little suprised with the ending, but I have come to expect that with this writer, but the story and the plot seemed \\"fresher\\" than the others that I have read that seemed to drag on with details. I loved seeing things from both sides of the families, and not really knowing who to feel for. I guess it captured a real life situation  if you were a third party in an event like this. I really enjoyed the read, and think if you are going to read a Picoult book this should be on your list!
B0016QNSFQ|3.0|I have a very mixed opinion on this film. Derek Jarman is renown for doing things in ways that split the audience in two directly opposed parties, and in Wittgenstein he succeeds in doing so within my own critical assessment. It is not as if some things are done well and some are not, rather it is rediculously ingenius. This split is a trademark of Jarman, who died of AIDS complications a year before the release of this Special Edition DVD. His choice of subject in this biographical surrealist enterprise is dictated by elements that parellel the director's life, as was the case in Caravaggio. All his late work is drenched with autobiographical meditations and innuendos that describe himself more so than his subject, although they succeed in recounting an essence that is shared by both. Here Ludwig Wittgenstein is depicted as he was dscribed, particularly by Betrand Russell, John Maynard Keynes, and his befuddled students. Wittgenstein was the type of overweeing explosive intellectual which you either hated or loved, both to no avail. The script is by Terry Eagleton, a cultural critic whose brilliant Marxist literary output, coming from the school of Raymond Williams, has defined a generation of poststructuralist disciples. This joint venture betrays a whimsical attitude that parodies and deconstructs while retaining a modicum of the intellectual zeal that was the bliss and bane, the heaven and hell of the Austrian author of the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, a work to which Russell wrote the introduction for as his beloved student lamented he had not understood a word of the Tractatus. Typical.  The humor becomes dark and sinister in turns and the surrealist representations are more of a subconscious disorder that seethes within the ebullient mind of the genius. The entire experience (and it is an experience more so than a movie) is a chronological pastiche, a pantomime of human woes. In a philosophical travesty the rediculous flirts with the sublime to furiously assemble a cadre of futile logic and implacable dilemmas that lead to nowhere, which is exactly where Wittgenstein wished to travel. Skits and gigs are memorable and do exhibit the logical depth that characterizes Wittgenstein's axiomatic engagements. Ultimately the operatic insolence is cute but deranged, the logical output limited and limiting, the rhythmic stress cavorting and distempered, the overall outlook so bleak and inordinate that we find our footing in a disoriented state with the same steps being traced over and over. And then, like a spark in the dark of night, a flash illuminates a thought and makes you wonder if you are moving to something that your intelligence mumbles trying to dictate directions. The acting is colorful and suited to a parody, and the performance of Karl Johnson as the adult Wittgenstein is impressive and faithful to the moody temperament of the philosopher's disquietude. His teaching is ludicrous but faithful to the sources we have of his inarticulate frustrations. All in all this is a movie that says more than it seems to. Any criticism due for the indelicate and overbearing role of sexuality in the person of Wittgenstein is well taken, but misunderstood and decontextualized. We have not enough information on the topic, but Jarman and Eagleton use this slant as a means of expression, a method to deconstruct, and an autobographical implementation more so than a biographical depiction. Hence I will refrain from making any comment on the homoeroticism that resonates in the movie. It is a split scene, a split subjetc, a dialectical seismic quake that marks the opening to an abyss that makes this a tragicomic experience leading straight to the inner void.
1416914285|5.0|I keep reading all these negative reviews so I feel I need to add something positive.  I loved this book; I love this series so far (of course, I already was a big fan of Cassie Claire long before this series was published.)  I do agree that this book is intended for an older audience, or a really mature teenager.  For those already familiar with her work, Cassandra's style really comes through in this series.  It is exciting, gripping and full of heart-wrenching twists (thanks to some of you who have already spoiled those twists).  I, for one, would never take someone else's word for it.  If you like the genre, you will like the book.  And of course, you should never give anything to your child to read without first reading it yourself.  I say this as an elementary school teacher who never puts anything on her bookshelves without reading it first.
B000092ZYX|5.0|\\"Pablo Honey\\" spawned mega hit \\"Creep\\", skip some years down the road (and two albums) \\"Kid A\\" is released gone is the alternative rock sound. In return we got a electronic minimalist style. Compare and contrast their sound all you'd like, fact remains they are creative and entertaining. Knowing the bands intentions to change their dynamic highly layered music, one must be filled with anxiety...You really never know what to expect! Scrolling through a few more years after \\"Kid A\\" and the decent attempt \\"Amnesiac\\", \\"Hail to the Thief\\" emerges. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is immersing, brooding (but not nearly as dark as past work, some songs are actually quite uplifting), and clever.<br /><br />  \\"2+2=5\\" is as complex a song, as it is to prove 2+2 actually equals five. The intro is simply a input jack from a guitar being tapped. Clouds  of sound billow each song some slowly and some stormily fast. \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\" has bridge that breaks the songs mold and speeds the whole process up.<br /><br />Before my laptop dies (4 minutes left so little of time), my pick off the album is \\"Sail to the Moon\\". Such a beautiful song. I just had a surgery and listening to this as an ambiance playing a game or relaxing in a dark room really painted images in my mind.<br /><br />Overall fantastic artsy album, easily their most assecible album to date. Easily worth a listen, congrats Radiohead.
0071592466|1.0|This book was a HUGE disappointment.   It is so small, and the book has lots of filler and wasted space, (like vocabulary definitions, which can be found anywhere).  There are hardly any answers or test content; the page size is so tiny; it's a pocket-sized book.  This book is just a shameful moneygrab, a TERRIBLE product.  Save your money and buy better IBT TOEFL books like Delta or Longman guides.
031606792X|2.0|to say i was eagerly awaiting breaking dawn is a complete and total understatement. i got line tickets early, i eagerly awaited my copy at midnight, and read it right off the bat... only to be disappointed. the characters seem to fall flat, having completely changed. the format is different. what she has stated to be impossible occurs, and it just seems all wrong to me. books one through three of the twilight saga are gold; i wish i'd never even read this one.
0930289234|5.0|What can really be said about 'The Watchmen' that hasn't already been said countless times before in the books 20 year history? It is dark, gritty, and full of real-life consequences for the caped crusaders that populate this universe. This is what defines not just what a good graphic novel is, but the entire medium, and it seems fairly certain that the film could mimic the book in the same way. I highly recommend the book, and by all means, it should be read immediately before the films debut in spring 2009.
031606792X|1.0|I haven't read the book yet, but my girlfriend is pissed, stomping around and acting like someone just kicked a kitten.  Now she's taking a nap and vowing not to ever read this book series again and I'm sitting here with nothing to do.  Thanks Stephenie Meyer.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie. I first saw this version in my English class and got so into it until I purchased it. NBot only is it romantic, but as some comedy and women being independent in thinking in an earlier period of time in history. Who knew?
031606792X|1.0|I just don't understand it! I loved the first three books and read them all within two days. I had a hard time reading this and can't help but feel that this is fanfiction (bad fanfiction). Too many things are forced down our throats. Bella is so out of character that I actually hate her in this book. Gosh, I wish I could give examples but don't want to spoil anyone who may not heed my warning. I feel like I have been robbed! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK unless you are a masochist and/or love horrible OOC fanfiction!
B00139W3NE|5.0|I resisted watching this movie at the cinema and didn't buy the dvd due to the poor reviews it received. I love my science fiction/fantasy and didn't want get that terrible sinking feeling when you know it could have been so much better. When I finally watched the movie on cable I was entranced, the movied is very well made, has great characters and is very well casted and acted.     At this point I should say that I haven't read the book so am viewing the story and movie with fresh eyes. I also don't really care whether the whole thing is a dig at Catholicism. Stand alone, this is a really entertaining fantasy movie and I would recommend it to anyone. In fact I am now going out to buy a copy of the movie to have in my collection.    Not being her biggest fan, I think this is Nicole Kidman's best role in years. She was another reason why I was prepared to dislike the movie, but I think her casting here is perfect. In fact I don't think they've put a foot wrong in any of the casting choices, although unfortunately Daniel Craig doesn't get to do very much.     So, if you aren't looking for a faithful translation of a favourite book but want to watch a well made entertaining movie - get The Golden Compass. Who wouldn't want a Battle Bear on their side!!!
B00066R4S4|5.0|Definitely another great book from Sophie Kinsella. Everyone can relate to it and you get drawn in the story.
031606792X|1.0|I am deeply disappointed in this book.  It did not even feel like Stephenie Meyer was writing the story.  I am surprised to say this as I am an avid reader and have devoured the first three books multiple times but I honestly would have stopped reading this book except I was curious to see how much more bizarre it could get.  This is not at all what I expected.  In my mind, the series now ends with Eclipse.  This book was a huge disappointment and I just can't even imagine what Stephenie Meyer was thinking, let alone her editor.
0440241413|5.0|You won't be able to leave it once you begin reading it.  Amazon shipped it so fast, I had the book the day after I ordered it.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I got this cd because I love John Mayer's live performances and was not disappointed with this excellent 2 cd set. In fact, he is one of the few artists who really excels in the transition from the studio to the stage. As for the overview on this cd, there are three sub-sets to the performance beginning with the acoustic set. Many times artists bore me with acoustic sets but I found myself listening intently on this cd as Mayer's guitar work is quite good...the cover of Tom Petty's \\"Free Fallen\\" is a nice addition. The trio set is almost all blues which again has the tendency to wear on me after awhile but every song is done so well it makes for great listening.<br />The band set is an excellent collection of his more popular songs with only \\"Why Georgia\\" being repeated from Any Given Thursday. \\"Gravity\\" is great in the live version and \\"Belief\\" is a real standout (although I thought the song was cut a little short). As good as this cd is though, A.G.T is a much better live cd (one of the best out there) and has much better live versions of his earlier stuff. It doesn't have the acoustic and blues material that this one does though, so really both live cd's compliment each other very well. Highly recommend.
0385340990|5.0|THIS IS ONE TERRIFIC BOOK!  I GOT IT THE OTHER DAY AND BY DINNER HAD NEARLY FINISHED IT, DID COMPLETE IT THE NEXT DAY AND LOVED EVERY WORD!  IT'S A WONDERFUL TALE AND WONDERFULLY WRITTEN, I CONGRATULATE IT'S AUTHORS.  THE STORY CARRIES YOU SWIFTLY ALONG IT'S MAGICAL ROUTE AND THE ENDING COMES MUCH TOO SOON!  I WILL GIVE IT TO MY GRANDADUGHTER AND DAUGHTER AND DAUGHERS-IN-LAW TO READ SOON AND THEY ALL WILL ADORE IT TOO! A GREAT READ!
031606792X|2.0|I was very upset with this novel, the first 170 pages or so where great. Then it went from bad to worse to absolutely horrifing.  I walked away with the feeling that this may have been slapped together to get it in print and to fans. I was very upset on how the whole thing wraps up, SM could have done sooooo much better.  Very, very disappointed.    Like any series, the first one tends to be the best and it is all down hill from there.
031606792X|1.0|Alright, I'll be honest, I never thought of Meyer's books as some sort of Rowling replacement or even that she was a great writer.  Her books were fun, her characters top-notch and the premise enjoyable.  Her books were guilty pleasures.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is none of these things.  Her characters act out of character in the book.  The plot points are barely explained and the actions that take place in the final book don't fit in with the first three books.<br /><br />We also have some very hot topic & controversial issues that are dealt with in the books.  Issues like pedophilia and abortion that I would be concerned about my children reading & I believe Stephenie Meyer has done a disservice to the parents of her readers by not forewarning of these topics.<br /><br />The book isn't very exciting either.  Everything just happens and we're told that they happen in a very boring way.<br /><br />For example, Bella gets pregnant by Edward and the whole thing is explained away without any questioning about why there was no prevention of the pregnancy.  Readers were previously told by Meyer that vampires couldn't get pregnant but here we learn that male vampires do carry virile sperm and can impregnate human females.  These are apparently called Incubi and Carlisle & Cullen crew knew about them all along.<br /><br />The child when born kills Bella, but it is okay because the Cullen crew changes her into a Vampire.  No repercussions at all, as being a vampire is what Bella wanted all along.  Although she never wanted a child before getting pregnant, but once she gets pregnant, woah nellie nothing's keeping her from being a mother.<br /><br />The Volturi show up but there isn't a fight.  They just arrive and go home without incident.<br /><br />Jacob 'imprints' on the baby fresh from Bella's dead body, so now he becomes madly in love with an infant, who, admittedly, is growing exponentially and will be an adult within six years.  It is still icky.<br /><br />The decision Bella made at the end of Eclipse was to be with Edward forever which meant giving up things like having children & seeing her parents & friends.  This book rendered that decision useless, as Bella is given everything without any sacrifice. She gets to keep her best friend Jacob because he is in love with her child, she gets to be a vampire and stay with Edward forever and she gets to continue to see her parents.<br /><br />All the growths of the characters are rendered null at the end of this series.  For example, Edward our main male protagonist was forced to get to know Bella because he couldn't read her mind. He had to access his heart and mind to 'get' to know her, but once she is a vampire, she has a magical power that allows her to let him read her mind now.  Edward grew and became a better person because he couldn't read her mind, but who cares about character growth and development?<br /><br />This book isn't for fans of the series.  This book was for Meyer to line her pockets with 400K. I would highly recommend going to your library or borrowing a friends copy.  I know I'll be donating mine to my local library or homeless shelter.  Maybe they can use it for warmth because it shouldn't be used for entertainment purposes.ever which meant giving up things like having children & seeing her parents & friends.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|The wait will soon be over Godfather fans!!! These classic movies are finally getting the restoration they deserve thanks to Francis Ford Coppola and Paramount Blu Ray!!! After all 2 of these films(Godfather and Godfather Part II won the Best Picture Oscar for the years 1972 and 1974!!! Looks likes it's going to be done right this time(not saying that the 5 DVD set was bad thing,I own that release too,but this Blu ray set is supposed to be TOTAL RESTORATION of these films baby,the icing on the cake!!! Four discs(3 for the movies,and 1 disc for the extras!)This is what us fans have been waiting for!!! Two thumbs up!!! way up! PS,Hopefully \\"Apocalypse Now\\" will get the Blu Ray treatment it deserves in the not to distant future,guess they want too see how this release does! My only quibble is not include the \\"Complete Epic\\" version as well(as other reviewers have stated),because Blu Ray Dics have tons of space which could allow this to be done,it it would be a true treat for us fans,but it seems that for now the remastered movies + extras is what's going to be on this set!!! Still it's five stars anyway!!! A+
031606792X|1.0|This book is a slap in the face of feminism, as the core message behind the entire series remains: \\"do everything possible to get the man you love, even if it means warping your own character to please him.\\" I've said it before and I'll say it again: misogyny is not sexy just because it involves eternal life.
B0012Q732O|2.0|While covered in dung and dust - teeth and makeup remain essentially flawless.  Yes, forget history, geography, etc. and go with the flow and its not half bad.  The critter encounters - mammoths, giant birds and a sabertooth - are the highlights.  The pseudo Egyptian civilization and the painting on a rock prophesy that ripples through to the end - not much use really.
031606792X|1.0|No option to give zero stars!<br />What idiots actually compared her to Rowling.  The only parallel is that she got young readers to actually read. However, Rowling didn't sell out her characters. Poorly done.  I won't ever recommend this series again.
031606792X|2.0|It feels to me like this was just a bunch of ideas of HOW to end the series shoved into one long, not very entertaining book.  I found myself very bored throughout most of the book.  There was no great conflict, no great adventure, and no great love like the previous books had.<br /><br />I know not all books need a message, but I adored the first three books and the message of love & sacrifice.  I cried for Bella's sacrifice at the end of Eclipse and for Jacob's too. In the end, he did let go of Bella even though he loved her with his entire being. It was so beautifully sad and romantic. I really connected to the characters and felt their pain.  In this book, I didn't feel a thing.  I found myself irritated and bored almost the entire time.  If it had been any other book, I would have stopped reading, but I wanted to this book to be good so badly that I kept on going until the very end.<br /><br />This review is pretty pitiful, I know, but really - I'm just speechless at how BAD this book was.  There are some really well written reviews on here that articulate the issues so much better than I have.  I just had to add my poorly worded two cents to the collection.<br /><br />Boo, Stephenie.  Next time, don't let your editors & fans rush you to finish something until you & your characters are ready.
031606792X|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Twilight Series. I was looking forward to the new book. I couldn't put it down. The plot literally gets more interesting as the book goes along such as: Bella is pregnant, the Volturi become involved,etc. The part when Jacob imprinted on Renesmee, that I didn't care for. Even though at eighteen years old, Bella seems fit to be a mother. I was actually kinda disappointed a little bit. Where is the BIG action!!!!!!??? This book is still awesome. I hope the movie can be at least something like the books. I hope Stephenie works more on Midnight Sun because I'm TWILIGHT CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|By far one of the best albums I've bought in a long times, Flavors is Alanis at her best.  She presents herself as vulnerable, playful and even with quite low self-esteem.  One thing that bothers me, is that all the people saying that this album isn't personal, aren't listening to the song \\"Tapes\\" which has Alanis feeding messages to herself like that she's unloveable.  \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" starts out quite mysteriously, with an almost middle-eastern flare.  It turns into a vocal powerhouse.      This album really surprised me.  To be honest, I didn't think Alanis had that good of a voice.  She's proved me wrong.  \\"Straitjacket\\" is another fave, and Alanis is quite angry.  There really isn't one song on the album that is bad.  Seriously.  That is how good this cd is.  The beautiful \\"Orchid\\" makes the bonus track version the only one you can buy.  Don't even think of buying the sub-par standard version.    Alanis tests new waters on this CD.  This is quite a departure from Jagged Little Pill.  It's hard to pick a fave song on this album.  It's between \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Not as We.\\"    There is one point of contention I must make, where I disagree with Alanis.  In \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" she says that her prisons are used for rehabilitation.  I beg to differ.  Prisons are meant to punish.  Case-in-point: you can't rehabilitate a child molester.
0061565407|5.0|I don't read nearly as much as I should so when my wife suggested audio books for our weekly trips to the cottage I was all for it. Don't get me wrong I love music and could listen to classic rock to the moon and back but I'm also a fan of good stories. Much to my surprise a good book keeps me awake while driving. This past weekend I picked the book and it was \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" by Garth Stein. I picked it because it is told from the point of view of Enzo the lab-terrier mix. Everyone who knows me and knows my dog knows I love dogs. It is the dogs last day and he is reflecting on his life as the pet of Denny Swift a customer service guy at a BMW dealership and part-time race car driver who treats him like a son. Enzo grows up watching TV but good stuff like Discovery & the Weather Channel. Enzo adapts to changes in Denny's life like him getting married to Eve and then welcoming an addition in the form of their daughter Zoë. Enzo learns all about auto racing and the lessons apply not only to racing but to life itself, even the life of a dog. But then bad things happen to good people and you get so wrapped up in this story that you start to feel as though it is happening to someone you know, the family next door or a relative in a nearby state. This book evokes real emotions in the reader or in this case the listener. I felt joy, sadness, anger and genuine humor to the \\"laugh out loud\\" state. I recommend this with 5 stars. It should be made into a movie. We got about 2/3 done on the way to the cottage and I was happy to return home just to listen to the rest...
031606792X|5.0|Okay I completely fell apart after reading breaking dawn i was so upset and disappointed i was so mad i decided to read it again before burning the book. I found that it is very well written the characters are exactly the same and if you read the quote in the begining of the book you'll realize its talking about bella becoming mature and putting away her childlike ways. The whole wierd bella that happens during the honeymoon is completely normal she is human and she is pregnant and that is her hormones doing all the crying and wanting Edward ALOT. Well jacob wonders why bella always looks so happy when he comes and why he cant understand why he keeps coming back is because renesmee is inside Bella. This is why Bella also feels the pull. No its not a sappy happy ending because the author made it like that its because Bellas been special from the beginning you have to expect some abnormaly goods things are gonna happen for her. It would have been impossible for there to be a fight scene at the end because Bellas  abilties wouldnt be abilities if she didnt use them that is her ability shielding she would have done this even if there was going to be a war between the vampires there wouldnt be a fight because once again she would be shielding them from fighting. Alice had to be mysterious or Aro would know what she been up to from reading the Cullen's thoughts it was very Alice and life saving. Now Edward and bella are not able to make love now because they have renesmee i dont think so even normal people do when they have kids duh. The only thing wrong with this book is that it needed to be two books instead of stuffing it into one book. Overall great story really pay attention and it was the best ending i could ask for i cant even think of a better ending. Also the reason why the cullens never talked about thier sex life was because thats private and they didnt want to scare poor little human Bella i know i would be. Anyways reasons why there are so many haters is because they are NOT mature enough to understand this book to all those whiny Little girls.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|My sister and I ordered the swivel sweeper together.  We had seen a ad for it on TV and thought we could give it a try.  Well it works great on all of our floors.  I especially like the fact that I don't have to get my vacuum out every time that I need to clean the carpet or floor.  I would recommend this to anyone especially since it is also very light.
1582701709|1.0|I saw this book last night and picked it up.  I had seen it in stores on the best seller racks, and it had a catchy cover.  At first I thought it was some kind of story until I opened it up.  After I read the first page I realized it wasn't, but being bored I read on.  The first chapter is quite interesting.  But as I kept reading the book, I honestly felt like I was reading the same page over and over and over again.  This has to be the most redundant book I have ever read.  The only thing I have gotten from this book, is to sell the idea that hard work and dedication never got anyone anywhere.  Telling people that their bad spending and eating habbits aren't cause for them being broke or overweight.  I simply finished the book because it was quite funny.  This book takes the idea of staying positive with everything in your life, having hope and a motivation to reach your goals, and makes a total mockery of great scientist and inventors.  Everything great that has been done was created by trial and error, not because some mysterious \\"universal mind\\" or genie wanted them to have it.  If you purchased this book, the only real secret is that you have wasted twenty-five dollars.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|As far as the mechanical, \\"I'm sitting here watching a movie\\" part, this movie is successful. It's beautifully shot, the music is bizarre but fitting for its topic, and the plot is thick enough to carry any semi-attentive viewer to the end. And the end pays off, big time. All that is secondary to the insanely good acting, though.    The actors that play Plainview's \\"son\\" and \\"brother\\" put in great performances, but Daniel Day Lewis is absurdly good in this role. It seems like DDL creates an unforgettable character in every movie he does, but this Plainview character is beyond anything else I've seen, other than maybe Deniro's Travis Bickle. Even in full psychopath mode, it's difficult to say that Plainview is merely a psychopath, or even that what he is doing is wrong. He is just a man free of all restraints -- social, familial, religious, even self-preservational. The way DDL pulls this off, without making the character hateful, is some kind of genius.
031606792X|2.0|What hooked me in the first three books was the tension - Bella (and Edward, and Jacob, and pretty much everyone else to some degree) knew that there would be choices to make and consequences that followed those choices.  There were two distinct paths for Bella to take, and choosing one would close off the other, for better or worse.  Getting what you wanted meant giving something up.  That's how life works.  \\"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\\" and all.      Candy-coating major life decisions with lucky compromises is an unsatisfying way to wrap up a series that so many people are so invested in.  The tension was what kept me riveted.  It's what made me read and re-read the first three books and look forward to finding out what choice Bella would finally make in the Breaking Dawn.  This book had the choices, but it lacked the consequences, and as a result, that tension that kept me engrossed in the story was gone.  Everything is tied up in a neat little bow with everyone happy and little physical or emotional collateral damage.  What the hell.      Breaking Dawn lacks continuity with the rest of the Twilight Series' major theme.  The whole series is based on choice and consequences, and Meyer seriously dropped the ball (or the apple shall we say?) on this one.  The plot bordered on ridiculous.  Supernatural doesn't have to be as unrealistic as this novel was.  You only have to look at the other three books in the series to see that.  The whole tone of the book seemed off from the three that preceded it.  Perhaps in an attempt to shield younger readers, she left out harsher, real conclusions?  Hate to compare them, but J.K. Rowling managed to wrap up the Harry Potter saga, a similarly young-adult novel with supernatural themes, with harsh, but satisfying conclusions.  It didn't all end happily.      I don't know.  I wonder if she wasn't rushing through this writing process to get the book out before the movie.  I sincerely hope she wasn't motivated by that, but given the quality of the end product, I can't see that Meyer was coming at Breaking Dawn from the same place she was before.  Breaking Dawn doesn't seem inspired by creativity.
B0007OASII|5.0|The second part of the Epica saga is definitely the stronger- from start to finish, it's just a slam-perfect blend of metal, orchestra, and of course the awesome voice of Roy Kahn. The best tracks would have to be March of Mephisto (Featuring Shagrath, another great vocalist who uses death grunts and growls to create a splendidly horrifying Mephisto) and the Haunting, a less heavy more poppy kind of song but still absolutely chilling. (And it has the beautiful vocals of Simone Simons in it, so of course it's a winner.) The entire album puts together a tale somewhat like the story \\"Faust\\" about a man who is tempted by the devil. What a great topic for a metal album!     Overall this is my favorite Kamelot album, and in you want something new metal-wise... this would have to be it.  If you're looking for more orchestra-metal fun, try some Nightwish too.
031606792X|1.0|So I bought the book yesterday, and started reading it before I went to bed, thinking that I would be up all night, trying to finish.  Surprise ending, I couldn't even get halfway through the book without feeling the intense urge to vomit all over this book, and myself.  Yea, pretty graphic image, but so is a baby EATING IT'S WAY OUT OF YOUR WOMB.      I knew getting into this \\"saga,\\" that the writing was going to be less than awesome, the stories would have some plot holes, some of it would just feel mega weak, but not once did I expect this piece of garbage.  Honestly, how was this book even allowed to be published?  I own the first three books, Twilight is still my favorite, and will probably continue to be my favorite.  Because even though I'm used to reading more complex stuff, I still enjoyed the romance, and the characters, and I enjoyed their development up to Eclipse.  I was hoping to see more of these three in the the fourth book, but all I got was a really bad fanfiction, and it cost me 25 bucks.  Why would I spend that much money when I could read crappy Twilight fic for free?    First of all, I thought vampires couldn't get pregnant.  And you know what, that makes complete sense.  HE'S DEAD.  HE'S NOT IMPREGNATING ANYTHING.  GET OUT OF HERE WITH YOUR OLD CHARLIE CHAPLIN THEORY.  The Second problem I started having was with the characters themselves.  They started acting totally different once the pregnancy plot came into view.  Bella became insanely weird and protective of this creepy baby, and Edward kind of just mopes around feeling sorry for himself (his dialogue was mega disappointing, by the way.)    Also, where was ALICE AND JASPER?  Where was Mike Newton, and Angela, and Jessica, and Ben?  Come on, those were good characters.      Let's talk about Jacob imprinting on an infant.  WAIT A MINUTE, I'M MISSING SOMETHING.  Oh yea, it's the Tarantino-esque birth that made me die a little inside.  Seriously, if I had kids, they wouldn't be reading this book.  If they make a movie out of this, so help me GOD, someone change this book completely.  Please.  Re-write this piece of crap.  Okay, back to pedo-Jacob.  You want to be with the child of a woman that you pictured naked, and pregnant with your child on more than one occasion.  You want to be with A CHILD.  A BABY.  It's a baby Stephenie Meyer, come on.  We were all freaking out by the whole Quil thing and then you dump this crazy relationship in our laps.      I don't know what she was smoking when she wrote this book.  I don't know if she was just trying to make everyone happy and this was the result, or she was just trying to make money and thought that 12 year old girls would love to have lots of sex, get pregnant and have a baby ripped from their bodies.  Awesome.  Honestly, this was terrible.  It definitely had potential to be an empowering teenage novel, as well as a romance, and it was just completely wasted.  I'm seriously pretending that I didn't read it.  I'm not the biggest Harry Potter fan or anything, but if anyone ever compares Stephenie Meyer to J.K. Rowling again, I'm laughing in their faces.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Get this blu-ray only if you are an audiophile because the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track will knock you off your feet with its chilling presence and sound envelope.....hats off to the sound engineers on the HD side....as of video i would give it a 7/10 for the immense graining and the inconsistent clarity...but this concert is about music and it delivers beyond expectations..
031606792X|4.0|I finished reading the book about 5 hours after I had purchased it at midnight. I must say that it's a bit startling to see all the negative reviews on the book. Here is what I think. It was a very grand epic book, filled with our favorite characters which I think is the reason we read these books. Some events that happen are a bit more macabre and morbid than in the first 3 books. Was it entertaining? Definitely. Was it the outcome that I expected? More or less, yes.  I think many readers are not going to be a fan of some of the content in this book simply because there are many things that happen to the characters which most readers would not really have thought would occur. Without giving too much away, I would say that I liked the book but it is not the best book in the series simply because I think there are too many events thrown in and it kind of feels like it should have been spread over 2 or three more books. Some events are very far-fetched and I think that's why readers don't feel the connection. The reader is somewhat overwhelmed, but regardless, it kept me riveted to the last page. Ultimately the love story between Bella and Edward is the essential part of the book and it does not disappoint.  Stephenie Meyer said that she had thought of exactly what she wanted to write in Breaking Dawn, and none of her fans really swayed the plot of the 4th book in any way. I'm just glad we get to glimpse at the lives of these characters and I'll definitely treasure these books for a long time!
1569242739|5.0|This book is incredible. I purchased it awhile back after reading it in B&N and put it on the shelf for about a year. When I finally got it down, I tried one recipe and it was amazing! I have since made about 6 different recipes from this book and I am looking forward to making more.    There are a variety of recipes here, some that ask for harder to find ingredients (like agar agar powder or matcha), and some that just use regular everyday stuff. I began working with the simpler recipes (basic vanilla, mucho margarita) and have since moved on to the more complicated ones (Brookyn vs Boston Cream pie, Green Tea). All of the recipes have been delicious. And I'M NOT VEGAN!!!!    I am having a hard time buying another cupcake book because this one is soooo good! There are great pictures, decorating ideas, and variations. I hope they come out with another book!
031606792X|1.0|All I want to say is this book is the worst book I have ever read.  This book ruined the entire Twilight Sage for me and I am afraid I no longer have any desire to even see the film.
031606792X|5.0|This book takes you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, for sure. It's a delightful departure from the others. Stephenie's writing remains gripping and rivets you to the page, even when you think you can't possibly take any more. The Twilight Saga is a definite must-have for all who love a good story.
031606792X|5.0|After reading many of the reviews before actually reading the book, I approached the book with great trepidation - how could such an amazing series be ruined with a disappointing ending that would leave some fans with the desire to burn their books?! I wanted to have faith in the author to deliver a storyline that was thorough, engaging, and as completely satisfying as the other books. I was not disappointed. For those reviewers who are complaining that the story wasn't realistic and that it shouldn't have tied everything up so neatly, what were you expecting when a series is about a love story that involves vampires and werewolves?! Yes, it got a little too sci-fi and gross for my liking when describing the unusual pregnancy and imprinting, but you have to admit, it was definitely a plot twist most readers would not anticipate and the author made it work! I was glued to the book for 9 straight hours because I was so absorbed in the story!    Stop treating Stephenie Meyer like some fundamentalist who is supposed to deliver this ground-breaking message! She is a gifted author who has been able to create incredibly captivating works of fiction and while the story is complicated, I believe that it is true to her original vision. Hopefully most readers can recognize that she is not encouraging 18 year olds to get married and have babies; she is very careful to promote \\"good\\" morals like loyalty, love, personal responsibility, and self-control. All along, she has described Bella as being different from others and noted how it would not be healthy for a normal person to lose themselves so completely in another person as Bella does with Edward. If her age had not been mentioned, I would not have considered Bella's actions to be unusual because you do notice significant maturity in her as the book progresses. The reason why this story is so attractive is because most, if not all of us yearn for the kind of love that Bella and Edward have - where you love someone enough to do anything to protect them and make them happy.     So for those Twilight fans who are now wondering if you should read the book after the frenzy of scathing reviews it has received, I definitely recommend it. Just recognize that this is the conclusion of Stephenie Meyers' enchanting fairytale and all's well that ends well.
B000001F9E|5.0|Excellent album.  I'd heard it before, many years ago, and knew TBABIT very well from the radio.  After I heard the title track used in a commercial, I just had to pick this one up.   Possibly my favorite driving album.
031606792X|2.0|SPOILERS CONTAINED    I love a happy ending to a fairy tale, but I never thought of the Twilight Saga as a fairy tale.  I had thought of it as something much more unique....well maybe something along the lines of the Harry Potter series, but then again that will never be repeated in our lifetime.     So I read the entire book today (I did not read any spoilers before hand) and found that I was reading it to see if something would happen to make some sense to go along with the other books.  I was shocked that Bella was pregnant.  I saw the clues foreshadowing it before it happened, but I could not believe that it actually happened.  It did not make any sense for this to occur.  I was slightly in shock as I continued to read because it was not what I expected to happen in the world that Stephenie Meyer had, or I use to think, created so meticulously.  She always seemed to lead us to believe that vampires could not reproduce because of their poisonous venom and their unchanging bodies.  I still don't understand how it worked, but Bella was pregnant and growing quickly, another thing that surprised me.    So, Bella is pregnant and we are then taken into Jacob's point of view.  It was a relief almost to get away from Bella's unique and unlikely situation.  We are taken into Jacob's pain and turmoil of losing Bella and just waiting to hear the fateful news that she is turned and will never choice him.  Even when they hear Bella is back and ill they believe it is a lie to cover up the fact that she is a vampire.  They never thought that she was pregnant, which complicates things even more in the tribe.  Bella seems to be this catalyst that causes trouble and discord.  So once they discover that she is pregnant Sam wants to attack, but too conveniently Jacob rightfully becomes Alpha and leaves the tribe to protect Bella and the Cullens.  So, there is discord among the wolves but no straight out fight.      Well as Bella becomes more pregnant the baby is literally draining the life from her.  So due to Jacobs fleeting thoughts they decide to try to give her blood to keep the baby and her healthy.  It irked me that Bella was not annoyed by the smell when through all the other books she was.  I felt that she should at least be repulsed by the blood, but drink it because it would keep her healthy.  Again everything was falling into a neat little package.    So the baby is born, basically killing Bella, but she is saved by Edward's venom and Jacob has imprinted on Nessie (again seriously the name?).  And Bella seems like this perfect vampire, again not following the careful rules that Stephenie had made.  I had maybe expected that her aversion to blood in her human life might have carried over and made it easier, but how could it when she was drinking it as a human.      So they have it all and perfect family even with a pet dog.  But then Alice gets a vision that the Volturi is coming.  Finally some normalcy and possibly a fight.  I was looking forward to it to see who would make it out alive.  It seemed necessary that some die to show that some rules of the vampire world still made sense, but I was disappointed.  Sure Iraina died but we had not attachment to her.  I was preparing myself for what J.K. Rowling did in her books.  The reality that not everything ended perfectly.  I was waiting for the impending fight and their being causalities, but it never happened.  I did not want a fairy tale ending because this was never a fairy tale to me.    I did read the book in one day and I could see characters attachments due to the circumstances.  But I wish that was not the case because I thought the book should have taken a different route.  However, she did surprise us (well those who did not read spoilers) but I was disappointed with the neat little package in the end.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Hard to explain the plot of this movie without revealing spoilers, so I'll just say Memento is definitely worth a view, maybe two.  I do not watch a lot of mainstream movies, mostly because I don't feel like distilling the small amount of good material from the enormous volume of waste that is released into the theaters.  But Memento was a terrific exception to the rule, and the filmmakers didn't even have to use special effects as a crutch since the story was compelling.
031606792X|5.0|when i first read the spoilers (i only found the first 14 chapters but that was more than enough for me) i hated the book i couldnt believe it was real i was praying it wasnt but the more i thought about it the more i figured it was real and once i reread the chapters and the rest of the book i decided that it wasnt really that bad, and i thought more and more about it and after i got over the weird nessie idea i started to think about it and even if it did seem a little out there i thought well this is actually a very very happy ending for them and kinda a perfect thing since they all get everything they want and isnt that what people really want to read happy stories not sad depressing things (unless u r in the mood i guess) so now i am actually a huge fan of the book hearing about bella as a vampire was what i wanted from day one and knowing they are together forever ... i just wish she would write more about them in the future like maybe a 100 yrs from now or something that would be kinda cool i think, but i know she is going to write new books from other peoples views (nessie i am guessing) ... i just cant wait for midnight to come out i hope she does all of the books in edwards views because the way he sees bella is amazing and hearing it and all his many many thoughts and others thoughts is just great
031606792X|4.0|Ok, so I had alot of anticipation for this book, mostly for Bella being turned by Edward and what not... At midnight last night, I went to Borders with a boat-load of friends, got stickers, and had a pretty awesome time fangirling... ... I had already read spoilers online and downloaded the first 14 chapters of the internet when they got leaked.   As I read all that, I was devastated. THE BOOK BECAME A GLORIFIED FANFICTION! LOL @ Renesmee... and Jacob imprinting on her!!! I mean, WOW, talk about ridiculous. So I basically lol'd my way through the first two sections of the book, and except for the lovemaking, etc. which I thought was tasteful yet erotic in its perfect Smeyer way, I thought it was pretty awful. But then, *GASP* BABY TIME!!    The Book definitely picked up from here and got MUCH better. I found myself LOVING Bella as a vamp, and REALLY LOVING 'Nessie' (very unfortunate name)... I was once again pissed though when Smeyer only spent a few chapters on Bella as a newborn, which was ridiculously anti-climatic and irritating. And then the whole lack of Volturi battle came and went, and just, well... What kept me in this book and made me love it in the end was the feel-good giddyness that her books inspire. The Love. Yeah it's unrealistic, and quite ridiculous as times, but this book sucks a part of your soul in by the end just like the others. Do I wish the last book had been
031606792X|5.0|This book was awesome! Never wanted to put it down! I loved Renesmee, and there was a real Ending to the book because everything came together!
031606792X|3.0|breaking dawn was...different then the rest of the series. the previous books focused more on bellas strong love for edward... this one didnt it presented a new and unthought about focus for her love, attention and worry... it did give me closure in the end... i wasnt plowing through the books as i was in the others because i really missed the level of intimiacy in bella and edwards relationship... but it had its purpose i suppose... it really put some characters in the background... edward, emmett, alice they were all kinda silent through the whole thing... characters seemed to blur at times... they were often hard to define...    but i know i would regret not reading it... i needed some assurance and resolution to a lot of things... it was very informative at the very least... it included many extra details that helped fill in the gaps etc...    its not my fav outta the series to be sure... but it has its own place
031606792X|1.0|I was excited for the book, so excited that I waited in line for over an hour at midnight to get it. Stayed up all night reading it, well correction, trying to read it.    The book absolutely horrified me. Bella Swan became the absolute antithesis of a feminist(not too shocking, but still appalling). My main problem was how glorified these character traits became, how disguised they were in claims of true love and all things good. It was hard not to vomit.     I kept reading hoping to find some redeeming quality, some genius subplot or dilemma or real world problem tackled in a creative and interesting way. Something out of the ordinary that I couldn't have predicted on my own. Something that made me think a little bit, or yearn for, or fret about. Nothing came, and I simply stopped caring. Everything was just too easy and unrealistic to be anything close to captivating.    I loved the first three books in the series, despite their obvious shortcomings. I took the books for what they were, fun fictional fantasy, and was fine with that. I would have been fine with it in this circumstance too, if it wasn't so completely awful.
031606792X|5.0|Ok. SPOILERS!    The only reason why bella is different is because she is a vampire!  this is an amayzing book and stephenie meyer deserves a lot of credit.  I would give it way more than 5 stars if I could.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I love Stargate SG-1 and I've seen every episode, most more than once, and I think Continuum is the best \\"episode\\" yet. It is truly movie quality and belongs on the big screen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, not just Stargate fans.
B001CXW8CW|4.0|While I've always felt that Christian Bale was an excellent choice for the new Batman series, I almost gagged when I heard Heath Ledger was playing the Joker thinking that he would never be able to pull it off.  I was wrong.  His performance was excellent and should not be compared to Jack Nicholson's version of the Joker character in the earlier Batman movie(equally excellent) because they were meant to be different.  Heath Ledger's Joker was much more demented and macabre.  I should have known that he had the chops for it by his stunning performance as a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain... somehow I guess I had forgotten.<br /><br />The Dark Knight had a darker, more sinister touch to it and it had darker psychological undertones.  There were twists on top of twists on top of even more twists that kept you guessing, too.  Not an easily figured out plot.  I walked away a little overwhelmed, but thought the movie was solid and well worth the price of admission.  I wish all superhero movies that have been made over the past decade and a half had been done as well.
1596912855|4.0|I work for a school and try to read some young adult and children's literature so that I'll be able to use and recommend good contemporary books to the students. Often, this reading is amusing for me, but it typically feels like it's just a professional duty. I rarely find myself really hooked by the books.    The exception, though, is anything written by Shannon Hale. She's a tremendous writer. She can take seemingly tired plot patterns (such as princess training in the wonderful Princess Academy) and make it feel like you've never seen anything like it before. She, too, is just the sort of writer who'd be fun to read even if the plot was terrible. It's great prose, with precise and surprising images and with humorous observations. I would, and do, recommend those novels to anyone--including adults.    So anyway, I was very excited to see that Austenland, a novel targeted for an adult audience (especially one knowledgeable of Jane Austen's oeuvre), was coming out. Upon reading it, I'd say that Austenland definitely doesn't reach the level of Hale's young adult novels, but it was also not a disappointment.    I love the premise. Jane, a thirty-three-year-old graphic designer, is still single and has become obsessed with Colin Firth's Darcy from Pride and Prejudice. She wonders if her dreams have hindered her ability to fall in love with a \\"real\\" man. Jane's aunt (somewhat implausibly--one of the flaws in the novel, I thought) intuits her Pride and Prejudice obsession and bequeaths her with a three-week   stay at a sort of resort in which Austen's England and Austen-like plots are enacted. Jane sees this as a chance to finally confront and reject the unrealistic images that have been holding her back, and she decides to take the trip.    Of course, not much is going to turn out as she expects. There's quite a cast of characters to deal with, including an absurd and out-of-place Southern woman (Mrs. Charming), a rival, a drunk, a Darcy, and a handsome gardener. She'scome to Austenland to reject her fantasies so that she can finally live and find love in the real world, but when she meets these characters, what's reality and what's fantasy become pretty intertwined. She's got a lot more challenges to overcome than she ever thought.     Some of those characters were a bit overdone (especially in the audio version), and some of the jokes fall flat, but overall, it certainly manages to entertain. Once you accept the first premise of the book, everything else plays out logically, surprisingly, and in satisfying ways. There are a number of comical situations, and there is actual character growth, and there is quite a romance (or two) that develops.     So, if you like light romance, if you like Jane Austen, or Shannon Hale, I think you'll find this a really fun little novel.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|The songs in \\"George Harrison\\" are poems of transformation.  They tell of changes from day to night, summer to winter, storm to calm.  Describing what is impermanent, they make visible the timeless love that surrounds us.<br /><br />Harrison recorded this album during the summer and fall of 1978 in his home studio at Friar Park, England.  He had composed several of the songs in Hawaii, and one (\\"Soft Touch\\") in the Virgin Islands.  His art, like that of the painter Gauguin before him, blossomed in the tropics, nurtured by the lush, bright atmosphere he found there.<br /><br />Meditations on nature form the core of the work.  There is \\"Here Comes the Moon,\\" expressing awe as a full moon appears on a Hawaiian shore while the sun is setting; \\"Blow Away,\\" where redemptive sunlight follows an English rainstorm; and \\"Your Love is Forever,\\" which begins:<br /><br /> Sublime is the summertime warm and lazy...<br /> These are perfect days like Heaven's about here,<br /> But unlike summer came and went-<br /> Your love is forever.<br /><br />Other songs depict extremes of consciousness.  In \\"Soft-Hearted Hana,\\" Harrison eats \\"magic mushrooms\\" on the island of Maui, and grows as tall as the Haleakala volcano.  He falls in love with Hana, who \\"lives beneath the crater in the meadow,\\" meeting her \\"among the fruit and grain...after heavy rain has fallen.\\"  \\"Faster\\" was inspired by Harrison's friends in Formula One racing.  It is a tribute to all those who have \\"moved into the space/ That the special people share/ Right on the edge of do or die/ Where there is nothing left to spare.\\"<br /><br />\\"Brown-Eyed Lady\\" is a love song for Harrison's wife, Olivia.  In the album notes (taken from his autobiography  \\"I Me Mine\\"), he said the song \\"sounds to me a bit Hawaiian/Spanish.\\"  To my ears, it also resembles Brazilian bossa nova.  The lilting verse of \\"Soft Touch\\" may be for Harrison's new son, Dhani:  \\"You're a soft touch baby/ Like a snow flake falling/  My whole heart is melting/ As a warm sun rises.\\"<br /><br />Dating from 1968, \\"Not Guilty\\" alludes to the discord within The Beatles at that time.  The bitter edge of its lyrics contrasts with the album's prevailing, upbeat mood.  It ends with melancholy, wordless singing.<br /><br />The beginning song, \\"Love Comes to Everyone,\\" and finale, \\"If You Believe,\\" are morale builders meant to encourage us in our present situations, whatever they are.  \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" states the imperative of life:<br /><br /> Go do it,<br /> Got to go through the door,<br /> There's no easy way out at all...<br /> Still it only takes time<br /> 'Til love comes to everyone.<br /><br />The music of \\"George Harrison\\" is gorgeous.  Its lovely and complex harmonies unfold in an instrumental mix that is both clear and rich.  Harrison said that the open tuning on his slide guitar forced him to make up new chords, rather than use conventional ones.  On \\"Blow Away\\" and \\"Your Love is Forever,\\" he plays this guitar with the expressiveness of a human voice.<br /><br />I especially enjoy the music of \\"Here Comes the Moon.\\"  Its sprinkles of harp tones sound like stars twinkling.  Sustained vocal and keyboard chords, supported by Willie Weeks' bass, convey the majesty and peace of the cosmos.  As Harrison sings \\"here comes the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon, the moon,\\" a sudden shift to quick guitar triplets emphasizes the drama of the moon's emergence.  The CD's two versions of this song complement each other.  The full instrumental recording paints an image of the spectacle unfolding in the sky, while the bonus, solo acoustic track expresses Harrison's feelings as he watches.<br /><br />Created at the artistic midpoint of Harrison's solo career, \\"George Harrison\\" is his transcendent album.  Its radiant spirit reveals the essence of the artist, and shows why he is irreplaceable.
031606792X|1.0|This was absolutely ridiculous from the first page! I only finished it because I was curious about what happened to the characters. If this had been the first book in her series I doubt that anyone would buy it. The only people who will like this book are the ones who enjoy corny fanfiction. Again... what a dissapointment.
031606792X|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I really pushed all the worst case scenios out of my head and started reading. The first 150 pages were exactly what I wanted. I was very happy. However, 700 pages were left and that is where the breakdown begins. The book starts well and ends well. The middle parts are the worst random horror/sci-fi pieces trying to fit together. There was no central arc that a character is trying to achieve, no epic battles, no sacrifices. Nothing really happened that could spawn 800 pages. It would work as a 200 page book without all the filler. I cannot believe that this book was edited and published as the actual ending to a great series. All of the characters are completely out of character and it feels like someone else wrote this book. It needs a re-write. Don't get me started on the horrible typos. This book was just horrible. I'm extremely disappointed that I spent 5 hours reading this book. I'm returning mine this afternoon.
0307237702|2.0|Well, the book seems to have way too much audacity, and not much hope.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Erykah Badu's 4th album New Amerykah is one of those headscratching releases.  When I first heard the lead single Honey (great song by the way), I thought Erykah Badu was returning to her roots of what she was doing on Baduizm but updated for the 08.  You can't imagine how excited I was for this release.  But Erykah Badu, as always, had a different plan in motion.  Rather than giving the fans what they thought they wanted, she gives us what we knew we wanted all along.  And it's hot..it may take some time to fully appreciate this album but it's worth it to  be submerged in the funk. This album is almost like a heavyweight getting knocked out.  I thought I knew what was coming but instead of that right cross I get hit with a left hook...right in the chin.  And after waking from the knockout I was like \\"what just happened?\\".  But after reviewing the tape I could see that she set it up quite nicely and I was forewarned in previous rounds but it took me hitting the canvas to understand exactly what happened and what was happening before.  Now my eyes are wide open and I can see.  She was never going for the right at all she was always going for the left!  What was I thinking?  Some may not understand the album just as this review but hey one day it'll aall make sense.
031606792X|5.0|Thank you Stephenie Meyer for another wild ride.  For the happiness.    I understand that SM could not make everyone happy with the final book in the series.  I, however, am one she pleased.  I loved this book.  I will read it again.  Very soon.    For those that are upset over the developments, let it go.  So you didn't get what you want?  So the unbelievability factor has been cranked up a notch?  Let me clue you in on something... This is fiction.  Not everyone is going to be completely happy with the outcome.    I am so glad to get to share this adventure with Bella & Edward & Jacob & the whole crew.  Over and over!
031606792X|3.0|I think Breaking Dawn fleshed out some of the truly scary religious (okay, Mormon) elements hinted at in the first three books. Motherhood- apparently young motherhood- is what it's all about. Esme, Rosalie, and even Leah represent the pro-mother stance of the book. Not just pro-mother, but the-only-important-thing-is-motherhood. Alice is an exception, but then again, Meyer not-so-delicately removes her from most of the action in the book- her role in Breaking Dawn is largely relegated to superficial aspects such as picking out Bella's lingerie and decorating her house... when Bella steps into her role as mother, Alice is MIA for almost the entire rest of the book. And if we understand Renee as the \\"non-ideal\\" woman, a mother who (though she clearly loves Bella) puts her own needs above her daughter's, we can understand why Meyer forces Bella to completely shut Renee out of her life. Bella does name her daughter Renesmee, which seems somewhat sweet and emblematic of a connection to her mother, but this is clearly just an unoriginal Mormon naming tradition- Bella mentions later that \\"distancing herself from Renee\\" is the right thing to do because Renee isn't \\"strong enough to handle it.\\" I saw right through this- Meyer has clearly condemned Renee from the very beginning not for marrying and breeding young, but for failing to live up to the perfect Mormon wife-and-mother ideal standard after said marriage and motherhood. Renee is out and Alice is missing- the motherhood-worshipping Esme, Rosalie, Leah, and now Bella- are in. A pretty unsatisfying conclusion to a potentially great saga.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|I was upset that the HD side of the dvd didn't work. I even though that it was defective and sent it back for another one and the new didn't work either. I so PO I was ready to just give up...until I came across the person who said that using the XBOX 360 HD DVD drive just press OK on the remote and it should work. It can't be that simple right....well I tried it and worked perfectly, so I wacthed the movie again in HD this time and enjoyed every minute of it!!!! Thank's for the help and I hope this may help someone else.
031606792X|4.0|I was totally absorbed throughout this book. It was a complete, 10 hour roller coaster of feelings. I left it pretty satisfied.    So why are people so upset?    The things is, they had expectations. The diehard fans of this series had kind of a rigid view of what would happen. Yeah, everyone figured Bella would likely get bitten....that the Volturi would come along...that Jacob would imprint. And all these things did happen.  People were infuriated because they happened in ways they had never imagined, but shouldn't we be lauding the author's creativity instead? If she had followed what everyone had expected, this book would have gotten criticism for being unsurprising and dull.    True, I felt a little torn up about Jacob imprinting on Nessie. I had foreseen something with him and Leah, the wolf outcast, and I was kind of disappointed/depressed. I feel criticism about him imprinting on a kid is kind of dumb, since it's already been established that it's not creepy.    And Bella getting pregnant? Just because it sounds a little fanficcy (and it did) doesn't mean Meyer jumped the shark. I'm fairly certain she never denied that it was possible. Those who criticize the book for being anti-feminist are kind of dumb. On paper it sounds bad - Bella skips college to be with her lover, gets pregnant as a teenager, etc - but the whole time it was a choice she made. Herself. She didn't expect the pregnancy, but she understood it. Isn't feminism about choice, anyway? Doing what you want?    There's also what I feel is stupid criticism for Bella's happy ending. Yeah, it was one perfect bow, and maybe it felt a little too perfect to some, but can you begrudge the girl after four incredibly thick books of anguish and worry? No need to be completely sadistic, it is fiction after all!    My criticism of the book is pretty much limited to Renesmee's unfortunate name - I definitely thought that one was a mistake. Towards the end, also, I felt that the within the cacophony of all thenew character, Bella's voice got kind of lost, and relating to her had been one of my favotrite parts of this series. I would have also preferred to have learned Rosalie's actual intentions when she helped Bella - was it for Bella too, or just the baby?     So, SM, you've still got me. It wasn't perfect, yeah, but it was creative and compelling, and a large amount of people who disliked it are simply throwing tantrums because they didn't get what they wanted, or somehow assumed that you were pushing a message you weren't.
031606792X|1.0|If you love the Twilight series, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!    I feel cheated and I wish I could take back reading this book. If you love the series, make up your own ending, read some fan fiction because whatever ending you hear, it isn't half as bad as the ending in this book.    Stephanie Meyer should be ashamed of herself for this horrid ending to a beautiful and powerful series. Everytime I even think about this book's ending it makes me feel physically sick.     I do hope that you take my advice.
031606792X|4.0|The reason I enjoyed this book first of all is not because I am immature or to young as some people are  implying with their review but because I liked the happy ending. Just because SM didn't kill off her characters does not make this a bad book. Sure I would not say it was the best one, but certainly not deserving of all the harsh criticism. The book to me, was very interesting. It was nice to hear things from Jacob's point of view.<br />I do think things could have been written better, but this also could have been much worse.<br />I think the book is still worth reading despite the negativity. If you are a fan, I reccomend picking it up but you should know it won't have the depressing death of characters and it has happiness in it.<br />SOME BOOKS CAN END HAPPILY.
031606792X|2.0|What was Stephenie Meyer thinking?    I read every word of this book. I took my time, and let the characters develop, I even read parts twice. I LOVED books 1-3 and I HATED this one. It was too predictable and seemed way off style in comparison to the other books.    I started reading this because all my girlfriend were interested in it, i devoured the first three books, reading each of them twice. I couldn't wait for the last book to come out, going to a midnight release party at that. But here is my critique. . . first - I was probably the oldest person actually reading the book at the midnight release party. I'm 22 years old, and I saw a blended Mix of girls between the ages of 9 and 18 waiting in line to get their copy of the book.     When i got home and started reading the book, I was disgusted. I felt bad for the parents who were unknowningly letting their children read material like this. Married at 18, No personal independence or goals what so ever. Bella's life completely surrounded around Edward - a man in my opinion has never and will never exist in real life. On top of the fact that the first section of the book she was a complete horn ball. Its nice to see that they got married, but it seemed like the entire first section all she wanted to do was have sex! Is that the message we want to bring to young girls reading this book? That its okay for a young girl to obessess over a man, never form her own individual self and goals, get married and get pregnant? Is that what values we want to instill in young girls?    I don't know. I'm hoping she writes on her website her point for this angle. I would've rather seen it end in 3 books with a different ending then S.M. to waste her time on this 750 page doorstop.
0321344758|5.0|Steve Krug follows his own advise and lays out the book in such a way that you can absorb the first  six chapters, the good ones, in no time, and leaves you with a much better understanding of the problem of making anything usable. Everyone making web sites or software of any sort for use by someone else needs to have read this.
031606792X|1.0|I am a mother of four, three being teenage daughters. I read the series with  them and that was exciting and fun. I loved the first three books, although I did worry where it would lead concerning my daughters. The last book was a disappointment because there was not the character development that was in the others. I wanted a happy ending too but I totally agree with other one star reviews I read that Bella \\"got it all\\". I know it is just a book or series, but Mrs. Meyer was talented enough to make us love her characters and make them real to the reader. Bella ends up married at 18 with a baby and a cottage and all the money and time she will ever desire. Totally not reality. True, vampires are not a reality either, but the author made them real enough that readers, depending on maturity will take at least some of the plot seriously.     In addition, the series is marketed to girls much younger than should be reading these books. A little sexy for an 11 year old and I saw plenty at the Borders party.      I feel let down that more did not happen to develop the characters while having a \\"happy ending\\" without breaking every rule (Bella going through the newborn stage, Bella losing contact with parents, Bella giving up children to become a vampire) I also expected more from the Bella, Jacob and Edward triangle. I think a lot of the book was just a cop out trying to keep everyone happy at the expense of the series.    Lastly, couldn't there have been another name given to the baby? The name is impossible to pronounce and just is weird. I could not even picture the poor little thing. Looks like a three month old but already walking, talking like an adult with long blondish red curls? Ew?? Oh, that can climb on Bella's back and hide in her hair?    I wanted so much to love the book. I am so sorry that I didn't......
031606792X|5.0|The negative reviews of this perfect ending are harsh and ridiculous.  It's a NOVEL...there is no message relating to teen marriage or pregnancy or anything else for that matter.  You are meant to escape into a fictional world and ENJOY!  Why do the negative reviewers think this has to mirror or represent real life in any way?  This book fits in perfectly with the other 3 and brings closure.  I found the twists and developments to be intriguing, and I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Why must we look to ENTERTAINMENT to send a message?  Books and movies are our chance to escape harsh reality and enjoy ourselves.  I incredibly enjoyed reading this fitting ending to an engrossing saga.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Few if any shows have combined style and substance as successfully as Mad Men.  This dream of the 1960s is simply beautiful to look at, but more importantly the world evoked is the setting for an exposition of human character and the human condition. The acting is incredible-- Jon Hamm especially. Each episode is a poem and the entire series is like a great mid-century novel. Thank you Matthew Weiner for this gem.

B00005JPY0|4.0|Not every day or month or even year, a movie comes up that after first weekend jumps to the number 1 position on the list of the best movies as decided by the international movies watching community, leaving behind such giants as both Godfather I and II and...Wait a second, practically every movie ever made. That alone makes the newest The Dark Knight a cinematic event that must be seen by any cinema lover.<br /><br />I liked the latest in the series of Batman movies a lot. It is dynamic, appropriately dark and bleak, it is shot amazingly, staged artistically, the music by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer truly adds to the atmosphere. On the top of it, it is cleverly written and gives each character time and chance to become interesting and compelling. With all that said I don't believe that The Dark Knight is the best movie ever and deserves its present #1 spot on the list of Top 250 film on IMDb.com. As the story of Bruce Wayne goes, I liked the previous Nolan's movie \\"Batman Begins\\" where Christian Bale had much more to work with better. There were also the moments in the film that made me laugh while laughing was not exactly the emotion expected in the particular scenes. It has to do with the habit of one of the characters to flip a coin while deciding on very grave matters. When the character flipped the coin third or fourth time, I was ready to address him, \\"Call it, firend-o\\".<br /><br />But - where the movie truly fascinates is without a doubt Heath Ledger's performance. He is a reason enough to see the movie. I noticed that when he was not on screen, I could not wait for him to appear; the film seemed to lose its appeal without him. All actors were very good, especially Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart, and their characters were not caricatures but interesting deep persons but Ledger towered everyone. It was his show and he ran it. His Joker that reminds a lot another fun loving villain, \\"horoshiy mal'chik Alex DeLarge, is absolutely brilliant and sadly the last work of the young actor who never got a chance to see his triumph on the screen and who without doubt will become a cult figure, an icon as it had happened with James Dean over 50 years ago<br /><br />4.5/9 or 9/10e young actor who never got a chance to see his triumph on the screen and who without doubt will become a cult figure, an icon as it had happened with James Dean over 50 years ago     4.5/9 or 9/10
0739367676|4.0|So, here it goes. Yesterday I wrote a review for 2 stars that has since been deleted. Let me explain.     I was one of those fans who was in the line at midnight. I eagerly ran home and read the whole thing. Like many people on here I was upset and didn't understand what happened to my characters. I didn't like Breaking Dawn and wanted nothing more than to forget about it.     Then I remembered that when I first read Twilight I didn't get it. I wasn't impressed and continued on to read New Moon and Eclipse because I got glowing reviews from various people. When I finished I decided to re-read the entire series. Two pages into Twilight the second time, I completely fell in love. I devoured them again (and again, and again).     With this in mind I decided to re-read Breaking Dawn. And the second time around, I got it. The characters felt the same, the story felt right and I felt exactly what Stephenie Meyer was trying to do. Half way through the book I was devouring it, loving every plot twist and scenario.     I am not a teenager, I am a 20-something college educated woman. What people need to remember is that these books are guilty pleasures. They are not encyclopedia's for the things that teenagers should do. I sincerely doubt that anyone is going to get married and have babies or be otherwise influenced by this book. It is a guilty pleasure and it ended in a simply delicious way.     So, to all those fans who are outraged, furious, fill in the blank, I ask only that you re-visit the story a second time. Maybe you will understand what SM was trying to accomplish. I really like this book and think that once the pomp and circumstance wears out most of you will find that you like it as well. Not all of us can be happy, and I appreciate that, but once we get our pre-concieved notions of what should be out of our head, you can see the beauty of the story the way it was meant to be told.     Way to go Stephenie, I am eagerly looking forward to your next projects. :-)
031606792X|5.0|For those of you who gave Breaking Dawn 1 star, to each his own I guess (I do feel a bit sorry for you, though).  As for myself- a 33 year old wife, teacher and mother- BUT MOST OF ALL- a woman!, I could not fathom giving the book anything less than 5 stars.  One of my favorite things about this series, is that Stephenie Meyer has made up her own rules from the very start.  She took these characters places I never imagined they could or would go, and I do not have even one problem with that.  Stephenie loves her characters, and I never once stopped feeling that love from page 1 to the very end.  I am re-reading the book again now, at a slower pace,and already find myself going back and re-reading my new favorite passages again.  I love the fantasy, romance, friendships, wit and dry humor, and so much more.  If you truly loved the first 3 books, I cannot imagine how you would not love Stephenie's ending to this wonderful story.
031606792X|5.0|I am nothing less of shocked with the pregnancy storyline since I'd completely ruled out that possibility of it happening. Through the first 1/3 of the novel all I could think was that this COULDN'T be the real book---it must be some sick joke. But I guess the shock factor was what kept me going cuz for me this book was more of a page turner than any of the first three novels simply because its so completely different from anything I'd ever expect stephenie meyer to write.    Although this book does have its share of flaws, I would say that its actually my favorite of the saga now. I particularly enjoyed the added \\"horror\\" and more gruesome descriptions of Bella's pregnancy and her being turned into a vampire not because its such a change from the pretty image of vampires stephenie meyer usually uses. I like that Bella's power was powerful but in a defensive way, not like some super great offensive power that people were speculating about. Another thing that I realized was that the feeling of the immense love between Edward and Bella is (to me) more believable than in the past three books where I was just under the impression that Bella had no idea what she was getting herself into.    The ONE major thing that I absolutely did not like was Jacob's imprinting...now, I've always really loved his character and didn't really mind either way if he just continues to love Bella or moves on to some other girl...BUT the whole Renesmee thing just completely threw me off and not in a goodway. Besides the fact that its twisted, what made me dislike Jacob (for the first time in the entire series) is when he hordes the damn baby from Bella. I swear it was the only thing that really frustrated me throughout the book: Jacob thinking he knows best for the baby and protecting her from HER OWN MOTHER...    For me this book was far better than I thought it would been---whether or not its due to low expectations or good story writing I don't know. What's certain is that reading it wouldshock the  hell out of you. I can understand why some people who enjoy the first three books would not like this one but for me, the change is a good thing---especially since I only thought the first three were just okay.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|This wasnt Stephenie Meyers best by a long shot.  I was pretty disgusted at some parts but I cant blame SM for all of it.  The editors seemed to have their fair share of issues too.  If you have high expectations for this book don't read it. But if you're up for the crazy ride and twisted themes and plot then go head and take a stab at it.
031606792X|4.0|***Spoiler*** Why is Jane Austen the only author allowed to write happy endings without being torn to shreds?  Yes, it wraps up nicely, too prettily for many who thrive on tragedy.  But that is okay!  IT IS FICTION.  It is escapism.  Things can be perfect in a fictional world and I am okay with that.
1600242197|5.0|Haven't had time to listen to this book yet. But it did arrive quickly and in very good condition.
B0013USZHG|5.0|The person who rated this CD as a 1 star, should be ashame of himself. Is the most absurd comment I'd ever heard. And I feel is my duty to report to the public that this opinion is absolutely WRONG. Gustavo Dudamel is simply the hottest thing to hit classical music since Leonard Bernstein. But in the world of music, why talk? Better to look, and listen. Obviously, this reviewer is in desperate need of learning what the best music is. Hands down, the best CD I own.
031606792X|5.0|OK people breaking dawn was awsome.bella was never a child,and she will never get older so she should have a child.i think the messege is that there is always a compramise and love can conquer all obstacles!people what is age to an immortal anyway!bella has had so much lost in the last 3 books let her be happy!and no one would be happy anyway because it was the last!i still love it and i think people should stop hattin!and ok the first book was not that good but the 2 and 3 were amazing!
031606792X|5.0|it's brillant. i think this is the best book in the series. the pace is fast fast fast & intense. and i think the writing is much improved. the story, the characters seem... more mature. just love it.
031606792X|2.0|*spoiler alert    I had alot more faith in Stephenie Meyer than this. She knew how much her fans were anticipating this book and it doesnt even have a substantial developing plotline. This book is completely lacking the twilight charm that the three previous installments have.      Basically, it gets as crazy as you can get with a book written about vampires and werewolves. Situation after situation is thrown in your face. Anticipated key events are written with the breeze (not in a good way). And key characters have all of a sudden acquired different personalities. For a book that originally seemed to have supported the idea of self-sacrifice, I have to say I couldnt find many examples, well atleast ones that made sense to me, in this one. Bella having a baby wasnt self sacrifical to me. She was selfishly wanting to keep it because it was Edwards, even though it was eating its way out of her.    Im not going to go overboard with my negativity, but I cant help but rant about this. Its was definitely surprising to me when Bella has a child. Okay. I was willing to go that far. A child who basically, lovingly ate her way out of her mommys womb? It saddens me that I have to imagine Bellas and Edwards lovechild in this way. Bella named her what else? Oh, of course. Resemee. How exotic and unique and sentimental. More like, absolutely ridiculous! Everytime I hear that damn name it reminds me of the Tresemme' shampoo commercial. Now I cant think of twilight the same. Whenever I think upon it, I will forever associate it with shampoo ads playing in my head.
140130916X|2.0|As an \\"International Bestseller\\" with a feature film spin off, I bought this book expecting a decent read. Instead, I muddled through it in constant amazement of just how bad the writing was. I couldn't even believe that it had been made into a book until I read somewhere that the author is the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister.    The storyline itself has potential, but all was lost as a result of the author's poor prose and consistently corny dialogue. Bottom line... I would not recommend this book to anyone who reads or thinks above a 5th grade level.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Excellent movie.  I didn't watch it when everyone told me how good it was.  That was definitely my mistake.    The movie actually haunted me after watching it, so I watched it a second time in the same day.  I understand from other reviews that it doesn't do the book justice which just makes me want to read the book now.  I would rate this movie up there with The Departed and Mystic River.  Every time I thought I had figured it out and it was over, there was a new twist.  Will be one of my favorites now!
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first 3 books and recommended them to multiple people. I will not do that with this book.<br /><br />For someone who states she has not read much of the traditional vampire fiction, she fell straight into the cliche' storyline.  A vampire baby - done before and better!  Developing a talent once the human becomes a vampire that saves the day for all the vampires the human knew - again, done before and better!<br /><br />I also agree with the reviews that state she tied everything up too neat.  Belle, Edward, and Jacob had to sacrifice nothing.  That is not what she set up in the 3 previous books and it is not reality.<br /><br />The most disapointing aspect of the book for me was her disregard of the laws of the universe as she had established them.  If you make a point for 3 books that vampires can't have children then you do not change this law to make everything come together in the 4th book.  The same with Jacob's imprinting.  It was obvious in the second and third book that the pack imprinted on Native Americans.  They came into being to protect against vampires.  Jacob imprinting on a vampire/human child would not happen in the reality she created.
031606792X|2.0|I LOVE Twilight. I'm one of those girls that everyone finds annoying because she listens to the podcasts, reads the books monthly, and had a countdown widget on her computer for the Breaking Dawn release party.    Breaking Dawn was probably one of the biggest dissapointments of my teenage years. I knew, as well as understood, that not everything I wanted to happen would happen in this final installment. I was okay with that. What I was NOT okay with was the way Breaking Dawn was so unlike the previous three books in writing style, themes, dialogue, and characters that I honestly felt like I was reading a very creative, but bizarre fanfiction. The whole book just had an \\"off\\" feeling that I couldn't really place. I felt like the characters I had loved for so long were gone.    The book starts off decentely. The I thought the wedding scene was done well, and I loved that Jacob showed up to see Bella once more. It all kinda goes downhill from there. The honeymoon was awkward. The concept of Isle Esme was ridiculous, and I honestly wondered why Edward took her to a sweltering hot island when Bella repeatedly states (in the previous three books) that she prefers her chilly Forks home to the beaches of Florida or the heat of Phoenix with Renee. As for the sex scenes, I really didn't expect anything really detailed, but after the steamy scenes from Eclipse, I was looking forward to a little description about Edward and Bella's first night of \\"trying\\". Then......Bella gets pregnant. WTF. Hasn't Stephenie stated repeatedly that vampire venom replaces ALL fluids in a vamp's body? How on earth did Edward's SPERM survive? Strike one steph. Once Bella gets pregnant, her relationship with Edward gets put on the backburner. Seriously, Edward becomes such a side character that I think that Carlisle had more lines than him by the end of the book. I thought the Twilight Saga was centered around the intense relationship between Edward and Bella? Not anymore folks. Stop at Eclipse if you want to read a romance novel.    Bella becomes so \\"not-bella\\" after the pregnancy that it was hard to concenrate on her POV. Switching to Jacob's was refreshing, and his chapters were ultimately the most amusing and relateable. He was just as confused by the absurdity of the pregnancy and the change in everyone's characters (especially edward and bella's) as I was!    I could go on forever, but the whole pregnancy thing seemed a cop-out so that Jacob could he his imprint yet stay close to bella forever. Bella didn't grow as a character or sacrifice anything in this book. She didn't have to give up edward, jacob, sex, children, relationships with her parents, or even a future at college since her first year as a newborn was so convienetely \\"easy\\" for her. Nobody dies. There isn't even a grand final battle. Everyone gets what they want and more. Life really can be perfect, right Steph?
031606792X|3.0|Has anyone else noticed all of the characters completely changed?    So Bella has always been kind of a spaz. She gets angry over everything. She shouts and screams and gives out silent treatments like they're going out of style. So what HAPPENED?! She doesn't get upset over ANYTHING! The only time she ever over reacted was when she started crying her eyes out because edward wouldn't put out. And what is even with that? It was completely irrational for her to be so sex crazed after just one time. totally unrealistic.     What about all of her friends? Never once (after being changed) does Bella express any sadness about never being able to see her friends again. Never once does complain about never being able to speak to her mother. When Bella was a human, Renee freaked out when she didn't hear from Bella every 2 days, let alone the months she went without contact after Bella changed. Wouldn't she want to hear all about the honeymoon? Isn't she supposed to be intuitive to the point of annoyance? And yet nothing... SM barely even addresses the issue.    And then Edward! Throughout the entire series, all he wants if for Bella to remain a human. Bella outright offers to stay human longer, to go to college, and to continue being normal. Edward traditionally would jump on that offer like white on rice. But no, Edward doesn't do it. Edward doesn't do anything. Throughout the whole book, Edward is just...there.    I was expecting that because Bella was becoming one of them, we would get all sorts of insight and development regarding the Cullens. All we got was terrible nicknames and Rosie's weird baby fixation.     Speaking of the baby, what is with that entire idea? Despite what Renee claims, Bella has always been sort of immature. She does crazy things like jump off cliffs and risks her life daily hanging out with vampires. Now all of the sudden, she's going to have a baby?! i don't think so. If anyone should be excited for that idea, it should be EDWARD. he's the one with the old fashioned values and family-oriented ways. And yet he is the only logical one.    Jacob. OMG. Absolutely nothing he did made sense. Don't get me wrong, I USED to be on team jacob (it seems ludicrous to even be on a team now, they aren't even like real characters anymore). Now I don't even know what to think about him. I don't care how strong the imprinting instinct is, he never would stick around with that many leeches in the house. He isn't mature enough for that.     Isn't imprinting supposed to make stronger \\"were-wolves\\" anyway? If that's the case, then it is completely illogical that Jake would imprint on a half-vampire.       But I did like the happy ending...
031606792X|3.0|*Spoilers ahead<br /><br />The Book<br /><br />I have to admit to being deeply disappointed in this book. If you're looking for an engaging read with an exciting plot, this isn't it. The plot skims along so shallowly, in fact, that I would recommend this as the perfect book to read when you need to concentrate on something else simultaneously. No one gets hurt, there is no angst, and everything gets wrapped up with a tidy little bow - hardly something that one needs to devote one's entire brain to reading.<br /><br />The pregnancy storyline could have been feasible, but was handled in such a ridiculous way as to be totally unbelievable. (What was she pregnant for - a couple of weeks? Come on.)  Moreover, Bella was able to miraculously skip over the whole newborn bloodlust inconvenience, showing remarkable restraint and able to move among humans immediately. Finally, Bella the Super Vampire, was able to develop her \\"superpower\\" in a matter of days, never mind that it took other vampires years, decades, or centuries, to develop theirs - if they even had one. In fact, Bella's superpower was entirely too convenient, ultimately saving the day in the showdown between the Cullens and the Volturi.<br /><br />( Now that I think about it, this is the book that should have been named Eclipse as the entire book seems to be devoted to how much stronger and better Bella is than Edward. (She's stronger, she has a better and more marketable superpower, she produces a vampire hybrid, etc.) I'm sure Ms. Meyer will write a follow-up to this book. To keep things consistent with this storyline, perhaps the next book can open with Bella and Edward in marriage counseling since Edward will undoubtedly be having feelings of inadequacy. )<br /><br />What Went Wrong?<br /><br />I suspect that Ms. Meyer is a victim of her own success. Like others, I am a die hard fan of the Twilight series. I subscribed to the RSS feed on her site so that I could be kept apprised of progress on not only the new book, but also the movie. (And I do suspect that Breaking Dawn was written in hopes of continuing the movie deal.)  Although the feed was helpful in providing updates, it was also helpful in illustrating just how out of touch Ms Meyer seems to be with her fan base.<br /><br />After visiting the site, it was obvious that Ms. Meyer has little, if any, active participation in her own site. This is a shame since she's missing a good opportunity to interact with her fans. It is run by someone named Seth, who also seems to be buying into the whole \\"Stephenie as a rock star thing.\\" There no way to contact her, or her minions, on the site. In fact, Seth says: \\"Stephenie is still much too busy to re-open her fan email or snail mail addresses. Also, I cannot forward emails. She is in the process of writing/editing multiple books, and I think we can all agree that we would rather that she spends her time writing instead of reading thousands of emails every day.\\" To Seth (and Stephenie)  I humbly suggest that maybe Ms. Meyer should look into reconnecting with her fan base - it's obvious from the reviews here that she's clearly out of touch with them.  I will leave you to draw your own conclusions after visiting the site, but my takeaway is that Ms. Meyer too busy doing promotions and living the life of a rock star to be bothered with mere mortals. (Yes, pun intended.)<br /><br />While we're on the subject of reconnecting with the fans, let's not forget the thousands, or maybe even tens of thousands, of Ebook readers Ms. Meyer and her publisher penalized for their choice of format. At the eleventh hour (August 1, I believe) the decision was made to delay the release of the ebook edition by a day because they didn't want copies being posted to the net. Meanwhile, print readers (like myself) were busy posting their first impressions, as were the audiobook listeners. Delaying the release of the ebook edition accomplished nothing, unless you count disenfranchising hundreds or thousands of fans as an accomplishment.<br /><br />In summary, my advice to Ms. Meyer is: lose the sycophants, reconnect with your fans, and stop worrying about movie deals and product tie-ins and write what comes natural.Ms. Meyer is: lose the sycophants, reconnect with your fans, and stop worrying about movie deals and product tie-ins and write what comes natural.
B0017MO10U|5.0|This movie was SO enjoyable!!! If you were a Stargate SG-1 fan, you will have a very good time with this movie - and it WILL be over WAY too soon.  The writing for the \\"Continuum\\" script was EXCELLENT - action-packed and an interesting, clever story line. I liked the bigger budget effects - direction and production were a notch above what TV has time/money to do (and, by the way, the \\"Stargate SG1\\" TV series is WORTH BUYING - really wondered what SciFi was thinking when they cancelled it). I wanted even more cast time in the \\"Continuum\\" storyline (there were places which could have used it, but the budget didn't permit, I've read).  I LOVED having snippets of all the characters old/new (so good together) - especially having \\"Jack\\" back. It would have been great to have Jack in much more of the movie. I always get laughs from the writing for Jack's witty sarcasm. I realized with great nostalgia, how much I MISSED the SG1 TV show (with these characters - so great to have them all together in \\"Continuum\\" - the regulars Samantha, Jackson, Teal'c, Vala - Jack's return, Landry, Hammond, Hays, etc.). I think Ba'al is a wonderful bad guy. I wish the $ people (MGM, I've read) would decide to do more SG1 movies this well done or even better with a bigger budget (maybe do 2 films at one time) - if they can fund scripts this clever and well-written AND with the full cast which includes Richard Dean Anderson.  Even though they'd have to film around everyone's schedules - leave no wo/man behind!  All characters are needed (we've grown to love them altogether) - to be REALLY GOOD - as this movie is - would make me want to spend my money to buy it - as this movie did.
031606792X|4.0|I've been scanning this page for a while now, and I'm shocked at the amount of vitriol being spewed at this book. Let's see what some of the complaints are...    Bella got pregnant! Oh NOES!!! How unrealistic and stupid and irresponsible and it sends a bad message and blah blah blah! As you can see, I disagree. This is not so much about the realities of it actually happening, as much as it allows us to see the parents reactions. Bella, the moment she finds out she's pregnant, shifts into maternal defense mode. When she realizes Edward wants to abort it to save her, she tries to save it as best she can. This leads to an interesting relationship with Rosalie. Honestly, this is where Bella switches in my mind, from an immature, shallow brat, into a still somewhat shallow, but much more mature woman.    However, the much more interesting story is Edwards reaction. His love for Bella is so complete that once he finds out how dangerous it is for the one he loves, he immediately does all in his power to save her. BUT, this changes once he realizes how much Bella loves her unborn child. This leads to him offering to make one of the most noble sacrifices I've ever seen in writing. He tells Jacob, that if she wants to have a child so badly, that he should convince Bella to have a child with Jacob, instead. Of course, Bella loves her child too much to do so. Mostly, it illustrates just how much Edward loves her, doing anything to make her happy.    Next, there's the imprinting on Nessie (Yes, this name does suck IMO) by Jacob. Many think of his previous lust for Bella, and blabber about how disgusting that is and other such rubbish. Anyone who says that has obviously never had any attraction towards more than one person. And it's not as if it's a sexual attraction. It is explicitly explained that it is merely a platonic love at first, which will eventually mature along with the one Jacob loves. Also, it is made more even more reasonable by realizing just what a deep connectionJacob and Bella had. They loved each other, and still do. Jacob has just found his soul mate, and that soul mate just happens to be the daughter of his previous love. The shallow mindedness of some people around here...    Finally, there is the issue of what a happy ending this whole thing is. My response is, not every book has to have gloom and doom about it. Is it really so bad to have a book series wrap up with no major characters dying? The Harry Potter series is better, yes. It has a hell of a lot of tragedy, yes. But that doesn't mean every series has to have tragedy.    In conclusion, there were some things I didn't like about this book, all of which are in the last third, however. The ending did feel a little rushed, I was disappointed by the lack of a last epic fight with the Volturi, and Alice finding other half breeds was a damn sight too convenient. Overall, not as good as her previous works, but great nonetheless.
031606792X|5.0|OK here goes.  I loved this book. I thought it went so well with all the others.  I could really see Stephanies development as a writer and I just could not put the book down.    Now, I have seen that there are a lot of reviews that say that there is not a good message and that everything gets wrapped up to neatly and that it is  telling young girls all the wrong things.  To them I say, if you are looking for a story to live your life by then you should read the bible or some form of uplifting and inspirational book that is meant to lead and guide.  Dont read a FICTION  book about vampires and then complain about the message.    And to those who think it is immature to want to have sex all the time after your married, you obviously didnt wait to have sex till you were married or you would see that this is one part that is actually true to life!      This book was written for entertainment and I am so happy that it had a happy ending.  Everyone was happy with their lot in life and isn't that what everyone wants out of life anyway?  Who wants to read a FICTION book that has an unhappy ending?     Over all, I loved it!!
031606792X|1.0|I can't say that i am a huge fan of this series, because I'm not.  I never really got lost in the world that Meyer created, instead was always looking at it with a critical point of view.    I don't like Bella, never have.  She is such a weak character.  Always getting into trouble needing to be rescued.  Always so willing to die for her \\"eternal love\\".  I'm sorry, but isn't 17 a little young to be giving your life away?  She was so whiny and rather pathetic I was always kinda wishing that she would die in this last book.  Oh well, i didn't get my wish.  As for Edward, he was so controlling that he made me angry.  Is this the example that we want to set for young girls out there?  That it's OK for men to be excessively possessive and to wait to be rescued?  I don't know, but the characters always irked me.  As for the last one, well everything was finished with a nice big bow wasn't it?  Happy Ending for all!  How annoying.  It was a look of anticipation, of waiting.  The last 300 pages were able leading up to this epic battle, that didn't happen.   No one died, well, one person did but not someone you really cared about.  Bella has a happy ending, Jacob has a happy ending, Edward as well, one big happy ending.  It was so sweet it made my teeth hurt.  Why are there no consequences to anyone actions?  Why did is all have to end perfectly?  Very lame.  Also, RENESME?  RENESME? REALLY? This is the stupidest name i have ever heard in my entire life.  Every time someone said it in the book i cringed.  The alternative wasn't all that much better, Nessie?  COME ON! I really want my 25 dollars back.
630587493X|5.0|Don't be mislead by critics into thinking this is a substandard movie because it is not.  The storyline is solid and the performances by the cast are true to form.    The story revolves around an android named Andrew Martin, portrayed by Robin Williams, and his desire to become human and experience all the emotions that come with it.    Should you read other reviews on this or other sites you will no doubt be inundated with comments telling you that the movie is too long, boring, resembles other movies, or that it is just not funny.  I personally found them to be untrue!    The movie is a little over 2 hours long and held my interest the whole time.  If you enjoy movies with a little sci-fi flair to them then you will like Bicentennial Man and while it does resemble other films it doesn't take away from or make this any less of a great, enjoyable film!    The movie is light and airy throughout and while younger children may not understand every reference and innuendo made in the film they will nonetheless enjoy it as well ... it is a great family film and one that I am PROUD to have in my video library.    Judge this movie for yourself and for what it is ... not for what others say it is, is not, or would like it to be!
031606792X|5.0|was so different yet very good  not alot of ppl liked it but thats cuz the book got more mature and darker rather than being a teengae romance between a vamp and chick
1594481717|5.0|This excellent book by Daniel Pink is an excellent primer for future thinking not only for business but for living.  It is a misnomer to list this book as a business book. The faculty at my school has made it a focal point for our curriculum planning for the coming year and teachers from all disciplines have found it instructive in reorienting the focus for our classes. The concepts presented in the book reflect a major step away from the linear progression of education for future leaders in any field to a more holistic point of view of what the student of today needs to succeed in the unknown future.  It provides a refreshing, exciting and optimistic view of what the world can be in the 21st century.
031606792X|2.0|Upon finishing this novel, I felt an overwhelming sense of letdown. For the past weeks, I had been working tirelessly to plan the release party for the local independent bookstore I work at, and was rewarded with the number of teens that showed up to eagerly await the Twilight Saga's conclusion with me. I only hope that they got some gratification out of the thing they had been waiting for.    The novel's three books-- Book 2 being told from Jacob's perspective-- give a refreshing break to Bella's immature, one-track mind. Book 1 is an abomination to every opinion I had formed about about the previous books. Not only does Meyer recap way more than necessary-- a little recap in any sequel is inevitable, but this was just downright ridiculous-- but her retelling of events that took place before the actual time frame of the novel is weakly amateur. The sequencing is off (for instance, the conversation with the Cullens about the immortal children should have been made evident to Bella AFTER she had begun having the increasingly haunting dreams about a child)and everything is told with a strange, glossed-over humor that makes you yearn for the more raw accounts presented in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. Bella-- I say Bella because the reader is at this point experiencing everything from her perspective--seems numb everything as Meyer strictly writes by what she is doing, instead of what she is feeling; making for poor writing especially in the first person.    And then comes the big slap in the face, after everything set up in the previous novels goes by without a hitch or a blip on the emotional radar. Bella's pregnancy-- wrong on so many levels, what with her emotional immaturity and lack of matronly sense-- causes the high school romance teens adored and coveted to take on an official, adult aura. How could this happen? Bella, the clumsy, quirky new kid in town, and Edward, the seventeen-year old, strikingly handsome heartthrob, are now PARENTS? Not only does thiscause teens to cringe-- I should know, I am one-- but it kills the romance for anybody who does not understand what it is like to have a child, myself included. One would presume that Meyer, knowing most of her fan base was made up of teenagers, would steer clear of this route for Edward and Bella.     After this maddening plot twist, we find our selves in Jacob's shoes for the commencement of Book 2. Strangely enough, I was irritated enough with the way that Bella's life was going to enjoy Jacob's strong, angsty take on life, and it was, as I mentioned earlier, quite refreshing to see the situation from someone else's point of view. Humor is reintroduced through clever dialogue, and Meyer seems to get her groove back as she navigates out of territory of a sexual nature, which was clearly uncomfortable for her. However, after Jacob's all-too-predictable-and-really-quite-creepy imprinting episode, we land right back into Bella's shoes.    Book 3 is a slight improvement over Book 1, the main irritant only being Bella's ridiculous selection of the name \\"Renesmee\\" for her child. As a reader, I can honestly say that it was extremely difficult to care at all for the fate of the child. She monopolizes Bella's affections (Where's Edward? Hello, that's what we came here for...) and is the root of a big misunderstanding, of course involving the Volturi. The facts remain that Renesmee was introduced too late into the Saga for the audience to understand Bella's attachment, not after her central focus in life had been Edward for so long. Speaking of Edward, how does he feel about his daughter and Jacob's relationship? Why don't we see a paternal side to him? Who knows.    As for Bella's newly acquired \\"newborn vampire\\" status, everything works out perfectly fine, she is of course able to resist human blood because of her amazing self control and can shield herself and her family on top of everything! How maddeningly, predictably, ridiculously, fantastically convenient for her.And then the dramatic, tension-filled conclusion... where nothing actually happens except for a whole lot of talking and predictable self-realizations. The epic, anticipated confrontation with the Volturi takes on the demeanor of a court trial and everybody the audience cares about walks away without a scratch.     From the moment I finished Twilight, it was easy enough to perceive that the following books would revolve around Bella and Edward's relationship, and how they would make things work with their supernatural differences. The real threats to their happiness presented in New Moon and Eclipse seemed like they would be the central focus of Breaking Dawn. Everything, from Bella's becoming a vampire to Jacob's attachment to Bella to how Charlie would react, was far to conveniently sewn up, with the added bonus of a baby thrown in for fun. All I can say is that this is the only Twilight book I will not be rereading, and I wish Stephenie Meyer better literary success with whatever projects she chooses to pursue.

031606792X|4.0|I can hardly believe how many people are giving this book such bad reviews. I greatly enjoyed it, in fact, I couldn't put it down! I mean yes I agree with everyone else, that I hated the child's name. (Did anyone else notice that Bella finally at the end began calling her by the nickname Jacob gave her?)  Yes, the pregnancy was really unexpected, and at first I didn't like it, but to me it worked. At least it gave Jacob the chance to have what he really wanted, a piece of Bella. In a way at least. I'm just glad Jacob found his soul mate.:)  I might not have liked her name, but I did really like Bella's daughter, she was so sweet.  Also, I guess I probably should have posted this earlier, but just as a warning to you younger fans out there, this book is quite a bit more mature than the others. Might want to have your mother read it first, or another trusted adult, to see if your ready for it.  One last thing, and my most favorite, Bella's Power. Being able to create a shield to protect her group is an awesome power, IMO.
0143037757|5.0|There is every reason to believe that Tony Judt's magisterial survey of the history of Europe since World War II will endure as a chronicle of those times. This is a book through which light shines as it does through the stained glass windows of Chartres.<br /><br />\\"Postwar\\" is animated throughout by the diligence of research, by a refusal to accept unexamined propositions, and by an extraordinary balance between strategic perspective and the intimacy of shared anecdotes in some smoky coffee house. The large moments of postwar European history are recounted in lapidary detail: Budapest 1956; Berlin 1961; Prague (and Paris) 1968; Karol Wojtyla in Poland in 1979; the transformations of 1989. So too are small moments and the granularity of details that are part of the world's often imperfect understanding of Europe: bad British cars; the atrophying of Spanish villages; the homogenization of many European elites; Euro Pop and football.<br /><br />From Solidarity to Monty Python; from Charles deGaulle to the Greek colonels -- the many tiles in the mosaic of postwar European history (and the intersection between that history and the subcontinent's many cultures) are painstakingly assembled by Tony Judt into a story that leaves a reader deep in thought and a desire to learn more.<br /><br />As his narrative closes in on the present, Judt probes the evolving phenomenon of \\"European\\" identity. What will it mean for the place of Europe in the shared destiny of the West? What will it mean for a sense of \\"Europe\\" in relation to its constituent nation-states, and for the cultural and national identities encompassed by the borders of those nation-states? What will it mean for Europeans fortunate enough to possess wealth, education, and engagement with commerce and ideas? What will it mean for those Europeans who do not, and for the subcontinent's dispossessed, and for its growing non-European minorities?<br /><br />Like the best histories, this book matches learned and often original insights with exceptional storytelling, and regular insertions of acerbic wit. To my fellow American readers, perhaps this explanation will suffice: the story of late 20th and early 21st Century Europe now has its Shelby Foote.
031606792X|1.0|I told you so!  As far as entertainment value goes, the first two books in the series weren't bad books or good books--they simply passed the time.  My objections to this series had more to do with the message it sends to impressionable young girls: act helpless, whine a lot, and ignore nice normal people in favor of some prince in shining armor who will save your behind all the time.  Unfortunately, not many people saw what poor role models most of the characters make.      Thankfully, the last book reveals the whole series for what it is: tripe, and reactionary tripe at that.  In a response to criticism that she was \\"anti-female,\\" Stephanie Meyer retorted that she was not, in fact, anti-female, but \\"anti-human\\" on her website.  Anti-human, and Breaking Dawn reveals it for all the world to see.  Girls, don't bother with college.  Who needs friends?  All you need for happiness is an early marriage to an overbearing husband--and don't forget the teenage pregnancy.  *headdesk*  How could anyone possibly compare this self-destructive, delusional, esteem-lowering series to Harry Potter?    The fact is that fiction influences us.  How we think, what we value, even what we love--these critical elements of our psyches can be subtlely (and not so subtlely) molded by fiction, whether it is the author's intention or not.  I know that only the most delusional readers will not recognize the series as pure fiction, but that doesn't change my point. Stories, whether fiction or not, speak to something within us, and the message spoken by these stories is unequivocally a negative one that reviles human nature.    Schadenfreude isn't the most noble of emotions, but it's a human one, and I think those of us who saw the series for what it was earlier on have earned the right to gloat, just a little.  Frankly, I'm glad the series imploded on the last book.  I'm glad that a lot of its own fans disliked Breaking Dawn.  Maybe now, readers will reexamine the series as a whole and think twice before gushing over these books.
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. To me it was a great to end the series. Going into the book I was not a big fan of Jacob. But by the end I really liked him. Bella became a STRONGER person in this book and took a hold of her future. She was less whiny and selfish in this book. LOVED Edward. There where some parts of the book I could have done without but didn't totally hate. But at the end I loved how it ended.....
031606792X|4.0|Okay first let me start out by saying that i loved the other three books a lot. Twilight because the story was so different and so amazing that it drew me in, New Moon because of Bella and Edwards love that lasted even after he'd left (i didnt care for the lack of Edward for most of it though) and Eclipse because it was so emotional and so powerful. Bella had to make a choice and that just made the whole story worth reading because you wanted to help make that choice with her. So when i got my copy of breaking dawn the first book instantly pulled me in. (if you dont like spoilers stop reading)<br /><br />In the first book everything with the wedding and the honeymoon was exactly what i wanted it to be up until the part when she figured out she was pregnant. Never in all the years I've been reading vampire based novels have I read one where the vampire can impregnate a human. The only story I've read that got fairly close would be blackwood farm but even that is a stretch (it's a book by Anne Rice). So that in turn threw me for a loop.<br /><br />The second book was entirely from Jacob's perspective. And while i hated how New Moon centered around him i couldn't help but love his part of the book. He was disgusted by everything from the child to Rose. It was just amazing to read all the hatred and disgust in it. Even better when parts with the pack. How he finally accepted that he was an alpha and truly embraced it. It was amazing to see what a real leader he could be and it was hilarious how he acted with Seth and Leah. Just the right amount of comedy that was need at that point in the story. I was really enjoying it until i got to the end. Now when he was trying to save Bella that was perfect to me. Her best friend, the other love of her life was trying to save her and she kept fighting because of him. Until he actually felt her die and he had to get away from her. I knew he would have killed Bella's daughter...in fact i kinda hoped that he would. But instead he imprinted with her. I laughed hysterically because well that's just what would happen. It in a way was too perfect i guess. It killed a lot of that part of the book for me and at that point i honestly had no idea if i liked the story or not.<br /><br />Finally the third book started once again from Bella's point of view. But i was a little hesitant to read it. Finally i dived in because at this point i knew bella was a vampire and i wanted to see what Meyer did with that. So i read on. Only to find that i was actually falling in love with the story. The fact that Bella was only 18 didn't phase me. In fact i didn't remember it till i was reading other peoples reviews. She didn't act like any 18 year old i knew. She acted a lot older. Especially with her daughter. So i continued on. The vision that Alice had didn't surprise me because i figured that Volturi were going to come back up at some point. But i didn't expect it to be like that. I also didn't expect that Bella's power was shielding. But it made sense because she always tried to shield herself as a human from so many things. Nothing about the third book really confused me. It flowed a lot like all the others and it was like reading twilight and eclipse again. Even with all the different vampire families that were introduced. Though i did share Jacobs pain and was happy to find the index in the back. The ending was amazing and i could actually see all of that happening in my head as i read it. So in the end i was totally in love with story.<br /><br />The Fact that this book is receiving so many bad reviews doesn't really surprise me. People frown on things that aren't what they expected. Look at Spider man 3. People hated how it wasn't what they wanted so they bashed it while in the end it was actually a pretty good movie. This book was yes very different from the other three but what did you expect? If Meyer had only told the wedding and bella becoming a vampire we would have had a very short story on our handsand everyone would have been disappointed. Instead she added more to it. Made Bella more human to us because honestly before i always just saw her as a girl who only wanted to be just like her boyfriend. Now I finally saw her a person...as a girl...and as a woman. This book really changed how i felt about Bella. No longer did i see her as the clumsy little 18 year old girl in love with a vampire...instead i saw her as the strong, independent wife and mother. While yes a lot of people are going to be like she was only 18 when she 'settled down' but isn't that sort of the norm today? We see it so much on television and in our daily lives that it isn't that surprising anymore. So why should we bash a story just because it embraces what is going on today?<br /><br />The point is this a wonderful and powerful story when you sit down and actually think about. This is exactly how the saga was always meant to end. We just never realized it before. So Kudos to you Stephenie Meyer for an amazing story and for finishing it in a way we never expected.appointed.

For all its success, to my ears \\"Born to Run\\"'s songs are often sentimental and even phony: the record pumps up banal, everyday stories into unconvincing epics with comic book melodrama and unlistenably hyper-inflated wall-of-sound bombast. It doesn't stand the test of years well, IMO.     But \\"Darkness\\" is its shadowy obverse. More banal, everyday life-stories, yet made powerfully compelling by simple, honest, confessional story-telling and gritty, stripped-down musical arrangements that keep you close to the bones of some of Springsteen's sharpest, loveliest songwriting.     \\"BTR\\" is unconvincingly overpowering; \\"Darkness\\" is shattering, unforgettable. Not to be missed!
0451191153|5.0|At first sight, i never thought I would like this book or read it like i'm in that world; but, i did. I was in and did not want to come out, for reasons i, myself, can't explain. it's a great book of mysterious power to suck the readers into the vacuum of its world.
031606792X|1.0|What was Stephenie Meyer thinking. I never have bothered to go on line and voice my opion but seriously what a huge disappointment. I'v finished the book and i'm so upset. What happen to drama, suspence and true love???      Was a fan of Edward and Bella. The twight story captured you. Breaking Dawn was a joke of a book. I hated it all of it!!!!!
B000MGUZKM|5.0|Even by jazz standards, Randy Crawford has been under the radar for years, and perhaps criminally so.  She's always had a distinctive voice that immediately strikes one as having a grownup feel to her music, but she's for some reason been overshadowed by others in the genre.    One can only hope that this changes from this wonderful CD of covers, where she shines brightly all the way through.  In each song, she sounds like she is in her element, and she sounds as good as ever.    While it's always easy to pick up the vocalist in a song, the terrific work by Sample on the piano in this CD can't be left out.  Like any master of his craft, he shows here that he's just as capable of helping a tune as he is at carrying it.  If you doubt this, just consciously listen to the songs for the piano instead of the vocals.    About 30 years ago, these two led the way in the classic hit \\"Street Life\\".  With this CD, it's clear they haven't lost their touch, both individually and together.  One can only hope that not only does this get Randy Crawford the acclaim she deserves, but also that this isn't the last time these two do a CD together.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|How do I add anything to this movie?  It is all there: the music, the dancing, the conflict, Natalie Wood, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno.
0307388840|5.0|There are so many reviews of this book already that I am loathe to add more redundant verbiage to the pile.  So I'll just say that this is my third Ian McEwan novel (having read \\"On Chesil Beach\\" and \\"Saturday\\" before I read this one), and I must say that he is now one of my favorite writers.  This book functions on so many levels and in the end is really as much about the craft of writing as anything else.  We first meet Briony, who is really the protagonist, as a young adolescent, and we see into her young mind and heart, and understand, before she does, the disaster that her overactive imagination will cause in the lives of her friends and family.  She is precocious and thoughtful, but she is young and fails to understand that she is wrong, in so many ways, about what she sees before her own eyes.  Her emotions and her imagination get the better of her and although she ultimately realizes the mistake she made and seeks atonement for it, she has nonetheless changed forever the lives of her Cecilia, her sister, and of Robbie, the young man with a promising future whose mother works for the Tallis family.  Ironically, though, it is her imagination that will serve her well as a novelist.  The book flows through personal lives, society, as well as world history and moves from mid-20th century to the end of the century.  A good deal of ground to cover, but McEwan does it well, I think.  The characters are interesting and real and the story is compelling.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|I used to not listen to Alanis as she appeared so often to be \\"angry\\" in certain songs and the way she was promoted.    But then I began to listen to a few spiritual things she had to say.    This album for me is her best yet - with a caveat.     The \\"Deluxe\\" version is THE version to get - period. I cannot imagine a version of this album without the truly important \\"Limbo No More\\" and a few other cuts found only on the second CD of the deluxe edition.    If you like Alanis when she is powerful, less angry, or flat out spiritual, this is the album from her for which you have been waiting.    I have listened solely to this album for weeks on end now, as part of my workout. It so converted me that I bought tickets to her concert many months away. I only do that these days with those who truly move me and make my life better.    If you dare to look at yourself and ponder rather than blame; if you are open to great music that cajoles your spiritual side, GET THIS.    In my view, this is her best album yet - but get the Deluxe version or miss out on some other important (and one just plain Tom Tom Club silly fun type) tunes.    By the way, I'm sober and I have no issue with \\"Bring On The Tequila\\" as a very cute, poppy chorus that's hard to beat.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I am sure anyone buying one of these at least has the regular Sixaxis controller and this is exactly the same except with the rumble pack added.  I couldn't believe that they don't include the charge cord though.  What a rip off.
0618918248|4.0|As an agnostic who believes in evolution and the possibility of God, I found the first half of Richard Dawkins book to be an excellent excercise in logical thinking and his refutations against a belief in God impossible to argue against. At first, I found his reasoning disturbingly air-tight (disturbing since I like to believe, as I think most people do, that there is more to existence than this life, and more meaning to existing than natural selection, which is for whatever reason unsatisfying to me). But as I gradually gave in to his arguments and became more skeptical about God, I started to become skeptical about the assertion that there is most definitely no God. Whereas Dawkins skillfully knocks down every argument one could think of for God, he seems frustrated by his inability to disprove God altogether. I will give in to the caveat that God is most definitely a more complex solution to life than natural selection, and is probably a result of natural selection himself . . . but so what? If there can exist a multiverse and collapsing universes of space-time of varying laws of physics, why could there not be an evolved supreme intellect out there, perhaps of infinite complexity that evolved from one of these other universes? And if the laws of physics breaks down beyond our own universe, what is to say that logic and science also does not break down? (Science is, after all, limited to human thought and human senses. How differently might a dog, if it had the brain, describe the universe? Probably as a series of smells.) Perhaps thought and imagination and faith have more substance in these spaces between universes. This isn't, of course, an argument for God, but an argument that atheists such as Richard Dawkins lack imagination when it comes to matters beyond their field of study. (Why must, for example, everything be described in evolutionairy terms? Dawkins views are almost too colored by his expertise.) Humans have been thinking about the mysteries of the universe and coming up with improved theories for ten thousand years, and neither Darwin nor Dawkins have found the ultimate truth. New discoveries will be made that will flip our world view upside down and  be as upsetting to Darwinists as Darwin must be to Christians.     The biggest problem I had with this book, however, is in Dawkins' anti-religious tyrade. While I may not be religious myself, I learned long ago, while arguing with a Jehovas' Witness who I nearly made cry, the value of personal belief. Dawkins compares religion to a side-effect of natural selection, like a moth that flies into a candle flame. His dogmatic contempt for religion is clear and belies the clear-headed and non-subjective attitude of a good scientist. In one chapter in particular, Dawkins is confounded by the pan-cultural phenomenon that is religion, but while he shows the ridiculousness of some of the beliefs of people around the world and mirrors that with Christianity, he oversimplifies and downplays the value of religion as nothing but hokum. The Bible, however, served in ancient times as the collection of all human knowledge, covering fields of academia from literature to poetry, history to science. Yes, even science has its roots in religion, and the same need for truth that so passionately drives Dawkins is what also drove early theologians to write the books of the Bible. Dawkins erroneously suggests that religion may have evolved as a symptom of knowledge passing between adults to children, and that children, whose minds are gullible, developed a trait of gullibility and superstition. I find this in error for two reasons: 1) Children are by nature rebellious and usually seek out their own truth, anyone who has a child will tell you this. 2) Dawkins presupposes that religion is rooted in the irrational mind, when this is not the case. A careful study of most ancient religions will find a considerable amount of reasoning behind its teachings, including the passing of moral and pratical lessons. To the ancient Egyptians, for example, it was rational to believe that gods caused the Nile to flood every year, and this knowledge was passed on to help plan for harvests; in this case, though the prime causation was in error, the logic behind the belief was sound. For this reason I postulate an alternate theory for the natural selection of religion, being simply that it was advantageous for humans to pass on genes for imagination, or the ability to see things not as how they are but as how they might be. Imagination helped the first humans make fire, build homes, and dig graves. Religion developed alongside these early discoveries, and early cave drawings can attest to the imagination involved in faith: recombining animals and humans to create god images, and myths about gods also developed. Imagination was a great tool that helped early humans survive; it's what developed into religion and later into science.     Perhaps Dawkins would benefit by putting down his scientific lens and trying to see religion from a different perspective.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book and when you have so called Twilight Fans R bashing it makes me not want to be part of this fan base !!!!!!!!!!  If the book was not good or so so DON'T LOOK AT THE BAD PARTS TAKE YOUR FAVORITE PARTS FROM BREAKING DAWN THAT STEPHENIE MEYER HAS GIVEN YOU !  TO BASH AND TURN ON HER IS SICK AND GO AHEAD AND BASH BECAUSE IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER I HOPE YOUR HAPPY.         LOVED THE BOOK AND IT REALLY CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD LOVED THAT !    REAL TWILIGHT FAN
0743496736|3.0|Compelling read. Distressed by the subject matter, and still not sure I'd read it with children growing in the household....scary...   but important to help understand various aspects of parenting or lack thereof.
031606792X|4.0|Why are you looking for a message In a work of FICTION!!- Bad grammar alert so stand down if you can't take it.<br /><br />I will admit I was a little sad when I finished breaking dawn ... Everything came together and everyone got what they wanted- it was a fairy tale a fantasy.  JUST like Meyer said it was in her head.<br /><br />Sure it was crazy and a little choppy it didn't mean I didn't read the whole thing and enjoy it to the extreme.<br /><br />I was much happier with this ending to a series then stupid Harry Potter.<br /><br />My thoughts on this ending were that just like in life that crazy love, that infatuation that you feel those emotions have to change and morph into something different just like this book did.  We could not sit around for another round of \\"WHY can't I just have Edward  ... or maybe Jake\\"<br /><br />And thank God she isn't cooking anymore!! I love happy ever afters there are not enough in the real world and that is why I read FICTION.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because I really wanted a good fight, and in the end the fights ended up being more like real life- talking and swaying people to your point of view.  I wanted to see a tiny bite of death :)<br /><br />And for all the Haters out there running around on your moral high horse SHOW me your book deal.  This mom with a pen totally rocked the house and had her cool dream come to life and WE all loved it.<br /><br />So when you start to think what example does this set - start repeating to yourself... this is just a work of fiction this is not the meaning of life and love!!<br /><br />Just my thoughts!
031606792X|5.0|Okay, first of all I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the three previous books. I thought that Meyer's exploration of the feelings between Edward and Bella, then Bella and Jacob, was pretty phenomenal. It's not very often that an author can drive THREE novels forward with that kind of emotion, especially since the books tend to be fairly static, without a lot of quick action. These are novels powered by people and their emotions, not the things that happen to them. Character driven vs. plot driven. The grand difference between fluffy chick lit and something more.    That being said, I think that Breaking Dawn was easily the best in the series. Twilight will always hold a special place in my heart because of its riveting, absolutely hypnotic introduction to the characters that seem so real now. But Breaking Dawn sees these characters grow up in ways that seem fairly impossible, especially given that several of them have already lived at least a lifetime's worth of years. These beloved characters are dealing with real, grown up issues, like love and sacrifice and what it means to join forces and create truces to fight for what is right, and what you believe in. We began with Twilight, a crossover book that started with tween girls and grew to include their older sisters, their mothers, their grandmothers, even their brothers. And we end here, with Breaking Dawn, in a book that is magnificent in its ability to speak to all of them simultaneously. My 12 year old niece will read this book now, and then when she's 15 and then when she's 20, and she will see different points and understand different things about it each time. That's pretty magical, I think.     And for all of you women out there you are angry that Meyer is creating a message that encourages girls to marry at 18 and let a man take care of you? I think you've missed the point. These books have not been about anti-feminism, or choosing marriage over independence. These books were about the absolutely extraordinary circumstance that could create a kind of love so deep and true that anything is possible with it. Does Bella get married at 18? Yes. Does she have a child at 18? Yes. Does she have everything she ever wanted from life? Yes. (This includes that acceptance letter into Dartmouth that she intends to follow up on, ladies.) I think the point is that Bella is HAPPY. Do all women have to be career mavens in order to find fulfillment? I don't think so. And I don't think Bella thinks that either, or Stephenie Meyer. Happiness comes in different guises, girls have different dreams, and there is no one thing that is guaranteed to make everyone happy. Look at Bella, really. What did she need to find happiness? Immortality, true love and family. Interesting ingredients, hmm? Probably not the same for everyone.     I also think we're not giving our new generation of young women enough credit. I mean, if they're using a vampire love story as a how-to guide for their lives, I think we have bigger issues than a generation of young married couples.
031606792X|1.0|I was very excited when I got my copy of Breaking Dawn because I went into it expecting a plot within reason and some classic entertainment. What I got was a book that I couldn't endure past 400 pages and a whole lot of confusion. Bella gets pregnant? Jacob imprints on her BABY? Among other strange incidences and plot holes that I'd rather not ramble about. Was I reading a bad fan fiction? I can honestly say that it would have been more fitting to end the series at Eclipse. Breaking Dawn took the series above and beyond to places it never should have gone. Either the fame has gone to Stephenie Meyer's head or this is all part of some ridiculous joke. I'm extremely disappointed.
031606792X|5.0|While I loved Twilight, my interest in the series started declining with the whole Jacob-Bella-Edward love triangle. Call me old-fashioned, but I like my true love pure and undiluted. This book tied up any and all loose ends that I was worried about.  Spoilers  I get that some people are disturbed by happy endings, but honestly, this is a fairytale. It's supposed to have a happy ending, not some deep meaning to be pondered over. If that's what you want, try reading something different, possibly something Russian.   Bella does get everything she wants. So does Edward and so does Jacob. It's basically just a happy book. There's some suspense in it and a tiny bit of possible sadness but in the end, it's similar to the ending of a four-book love story.  I actually liked Bella again! Instead of being weak and whiny, she finally decided to act and play a real role in everyone's life. My only complaint was that Edward seemed somewhat one-dimensional in this book. Maybe that was to compensate for his brooding in the past few books.  Either way, I think this was a perfect ending to a sometimes great series. Bella gets a family, a spine, and real friends. Edward gets someone who is wholly devoted to him and capable of protecting herself. Jacob finally finds true love and everyone else is just fodder...Not as much backstory with the other Cullens as there was before... But still. Happiness all around.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have a new appreciation for the Adams family and especially John and Abigail. Know how this man worked behind the scenes, fought his political battles with the likes of Jefferson and then became the best of friends..... he makes a good case for understanding John McCain. Anger management is not a requirement for the office.. but having the courage to do what is right.  Other than that, if the Emmy for best actor or series, writing etal.. is not awarded, I will be sorely tried.    This is worth the purchase... you will want to view it again and again.
0061562408|5.0|From the start I was utterly entranced. This is a touching story of a family, their joys and heartbreaks as told by the one who knows them best - their dog 'Enzo'. Beautifully written, witty, heartbreaking and incredibly thought-provoking.    Enzo has gleaned most of his knowledge from watching his master Denny an aspiring racing driver, from watching TV (responsibly) and studying in-dash video footage from racing cars.    Certain passages made me laugh out loud \\"George Clooney is my fourth favorite actor because he's exceptionally clever at helping cure children of diseases on reruns of ER, and because he looks a little like me around the eyes\\".  I loved his absolute joy when his owner Denny finally takes him for a spin in a racing car. Bark twice for faster! And I felt his fear of the crows in the backyard, their beady eyes trained on him as if to say \\"Come out little doggy, and we'll peck your eyeballs out!\\"    I read this on the sofa with my dog sprawled out next to me and every so often I gave his ear a little tickle, just in the crease behind the ear (Enzo described the exact spot perfectly) and as he watched me, watching him, I wondered just how much he really understands.
031606792X|2.0|**SPOILER ALERT**    I was totally immersed in the Twilight world Meyer created until Bella became pregnant. Meyer had said time and again that vampires couldn't have children because there wasn't any fluid but venom and blood in their bodies. From that point on, I felt like I was reading a very good Twilight fanfiction story.     Bella was out of canon during the last 2/3 of the book and I, too, felt like this book was wrapped up in a nice package to make everyone happy. I know Meyer LOVES Jacob and, maybe, if she could rewrite her world Jacob and Bella would be together. I felt she  made a HUGE jump with Seth and Edward becoming BFFs forever. When did that happen???    Jacob imprinting on Edward and Bella's daughter was a bit to neat--and a bit creepy. Remember, Bella made out with her to-be-son-in-law in \\"Eclipse\\"! Also, I don't think Bella's daughter said \\"daddy\\", or a similar term of endearment, to Edward in the book. I was aware of Nessie saying \\"Momma\\" a few times. All in all, I think it was written well, better than Eclipse in my opinion, but it was too perfect. I felt totally cheated out of a fight to save the Olympic Coven. Unless she is saving that for a future book told from Jacob's point of view.    To me, it felt like Meyer didn't realize that her Twilight series was going to be so popular and when \\"New Moon\\" became a hit she was scrambling to come up with an end to her saga; one that meant she didn't have to kill any of the characters she loves so dearly and one that wouldn't enrage any of her fans.    A must read if you have read the other three, but probably the most disappointing one of the four.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|To give the utmost atmosphere of authenticity, `Cloverfield' films all its monster movie proceedings as though an amateur were using an average video camera.  All the starts and stops of footage are effective enough, and the glimpses of the modern equivalent of New York City's Godzilla keep tangible, but not always present.      Just like all disaster pictures, the prologue introduces us to all of the characters.  We need to know and care about them.  Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) and Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) wake up and talk of making a day of Coney Island for her first time.  Then, his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) takes over the camera later, and gets involved with a going away party for Rob, who has a job promotion in Japan.  Meanwhile, he and Beth have grown apart because of his move and some alleged infidelity. Beth comes with another date.  He and Beth have a tiff, and all the gossip hits the fan (or at least the camera).  To pass off the duty of filming little testimonial \\"good-bye\\" snippets, their friend, Hud (T.J. Miller), takes the camera.  Jason's girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), gets bossy with the festivities, particularly with Hud.  Interestingly enough he is a little shaky as a novice cameraman, but as chaos ensues into the night, he only improves.  Hud hits on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), one of the shrinking violets who gets on the spot being filmed on camera.  Amazingly, Hud gets enough juicy gossip that no one finally shoves the camera in his face.        Just as our exposition becomes colorful and sordid enough, their apartment complex is shaken, the camera weaves back and forth, and lights flicker on and off.  News reports tell of an earthquake near Manhattan with a possible ensuing oil spill.  Chaos spills out in the streets in 9/11-like fashion as people run and shriek as some yet unseen hazard.  Effectively, Hud runs with the camera out of breath.  After a cell phone call with Beth, Rob, resolved and chivalrous, goes against the grain ofthe crowd and heads towards Beth's apartment on the side of town seen to contain the most peril.  Jason, Marlena, Hud, and Lilly try to reason with him to stay with the flow, but Rob refuses, eventually talking them into going to save Beth.  Soon Jason is killed, and they must think and act quickly.    Much of the movie goes through the subway system, fending off more than one big monster as military personnel occasionally whiz past their direction, fighting all the city's aliens and gathering the injured civilians.      With a running time of 1:19 'Cloverfield' wisely tightens up its story as South Korea's '[[ASIN:B000PKG8TC The Host]]' failed to do. In that movie, it started out awesomely wild and scary, but lingered too long and drum beat it's satiric message to death.  After 9/11, I must admit my eyes welled up with tears several times during the movie.  A pre-9/11 'Cloverfield' would have had me engrossed in an arcade, the kind the Superman movies of the late seventies and early eighties did, but not any more.  However, a pre-9/11 `Cloverfield' wouldn't be the same, either.  The frightening scenes do their job, but they mostly go for reality, which they do in spades.  Suspension of belief is seldom an issue.     Fading reality:  Only three parts didn't do it for me.  One is when they're on the subway tracks talking about Superman as if he were real.  Did they decide to do dialogue, so we'd know this isn't `War of the Worlds' after making things so lively and genuine?  Also, when they come upon a military medical tent, one army man says, \\"The monster is winning.\\"  To me in real life, gung ho military personnel say something heartening but honest like \\"We're going to beat this thing, don't worry!\\"  Of course that would tip the dramatic tension, but reality was the movie's goal.  I also think at one point, the camera would get dropped sooner than it did, but that doesn't work to make this movie.     From other reviews, I was suspicious 'Cloverfield' would get shaky views to the point of irritation or tedium.   I didn't feel that way.  In a small way, 'Cloverfield' is a mini 'Matrix' or 'Blair Witch Project,' innovative and effective enough to steal our interest and undoubtedly spawn more films to compete with this one.     A JP's Pick 4*'s= Very Good
031606792X|3.0|I soooo wanted to go to the midnight release party, but since I had to work the next say (in the morning)I had to wait and buy the bok on the way home. I was undaunted by the size of the book, after all I have read HP 1-7. I kicked my kids out of my bedroom (I'm 33 BTW) and sat down to read.     **Might be spoilers down below**    I didn't love the book and I didn't hate it either. There was some things that could have been left out. The book was fine for me up until the point that Bella got pregnant. I have read different genres of books in my short life, but usually when someone says that they can't get pregnant or can't get someone pregnant, watch out! Chances are that someone's going to have a baby. Bella called Rose after Edward mention that Carlisle could help her 'get rid' of the thing growing inside her. If I wanted a child that bad, I think that I would also call the person that would be most likely to defend me in my decision. No Bella never wanted kids, she didn't care that Edward couldn't give her any. And when she realized that she was pregnant I think she was too accepting too fast.    I did not need to read the book from Jacobs POV. It was nice to see him grow up though.    The minute that Nessie was born I knew that Jacob would imprint on her.    As for Bella's 'gift'. It was just an expanded version of what she already had.    And I have to say that I missed Edward in this book. There wasn't much of him IMHO.    There were things good and bad about this book. For me there is just something missing, I'm not sure what that is yet. Stephenie wrapped up the story nice and tidy, just to nice and tidy for me.
0385340559|5.0|One of Lee Child's best Jack Reacher novels is \\"Bad Luck and Trouble.\\"<br />The story line grabs you from the first sentence and it's one of those \\"can't put it down\\" books. I've enjoyed all of the Jack Reacher novels. He's the guy you want to have on your side; he has his code that he lives by and he will see any situation through to the end, in his own style. If you like Ross McDonald, Robert Parker, Michael Connolly, Lee Block, and Robert Crais, you will enjoy spending time with Reacher.<br />As with many good characters and good stories, it is a pleasure to get to know the character from their first story up until the most recently published adventure. We learn more about Reacher's past in \\"Bad Luck and Trouble,\\" and through this story, understand a little more about the ex-military loner who brings his own brand of justice to set things right.
031606792X|1.0|What can I say.  I admire Meyer's writing style, how she delves into a character and transforms something on the page to someone you could actually believe is real.  I absolutely adored the first three books and I read them over and over again until the fourth installment of the book came out.  I admit I'm a little old to be reading young adult books (I'm 28) but I fell in love with the characters and the story, but to see it end like this.  I know Meyer is a good author even her book \\"The Host\\" had me staying up until the wee hours of the night, it was so good.  Breaking Dawn broke the illusion.      I've read a lot of books and believe it or not I've read this same plot in not so well written horror novels.  A girl gets pregnant and has a half-vampire half-human child, it's not right and it's not believable.  Forget the fact that Bella has character flaws that's normal and human.  Come on guys you know there are girls that center their universe around men or love.  I didn't care about that because I still found Bella likeable even thou I'm in no way agree about her point of view.      I think this book could have been so much better without throwing  a child in the mix.  There still could have been a showdown with the Volturi without a kid being in there.  I feel like Meyer just wanted an excuse to throw in all these other vampires in the mix so she can write about them later on.  I'm happy that Bella received her happy ending but not with the circumstances that led to that happiness.  The previous reviews are right life does not end with everyone holding hands and singing.  I know this is fantasy so happy endings happen more in books than in real life but in this book it's completely off centered.      Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter I'm sorry to say was extremely creepy I found myself getting sick even thou I understood the dynamics of it I still could not cope.  The whole book made human love seem trivial, like it's nothing compared to imprinting or vampire love.  I believed in Jacob's love for Bella, believed it was strong and enduring.  I think I would have been more accepting of him imprinting on someone else.  Meyer draws the conclusion in her book that the fates kept Jacob in Bella's life in order for him to find his true mate in Edward and Bella's offspring. Uhhh, What?
031606792X|1.0|Stephenie Meyer destroyed everything she had created in Bella in one fell swoop. The Bella of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is nowhere near the Bella of the other three books, and there was no written evolution of her character. The book fell short in more areas than characterization, as well...pathetic storyline (completely unbelievable), sub-par writing, and weak action. If you haven't read the Twilight series, I suggest stopping after reading \\"Eclipse.\\" \\"Breaking Dawn\\" simply isn't worth your time.
B00000E0YH|5.0|I've had Transcendence a couple years now and thought that album is very good.<br />In my opinion, this is even better.  Every song seems to belong, no filler here.  Outstanding vocals with bonus track \\"Dream Dancer\\" on this import,<br />which is so hard to find. Great cut. Like high vocals and intricate guitar work?  Check these guys out.
031606792X|3.0|Let me start off by saying I'm a 34 year old mother who is/was obsessed with ALL things Twilight. I read and re-read the other 3 books I dont even know how many times! I counted down the days (like my 12 year old daughter did) to the release of 'Breaking Dawn'. We went to a midnight release party with such excitement! Reading the first few chapters, I felt like something was different. The characters seemed a little different to me- but I still enjoyed reading it. However- then I got to Book 2. Although I enjoyed reading in Jacob's POV- I had quite a few laughs- I thought the whole storyline was ridiculou! The whole baby/pregnancy thing...Not to mention I wanted to kill Rose myself!! She only cared about the baby- not Bella- and no one seemed bothered by this?? Maybe Edward and Jacob- ever so slightly were annoyed with Rose. I had to put the book down and walk away a few times. Which I was unable to do with the others! The whole Renesme plotline was ridiculous. I can't say I hated the book. I don't think I could ever hate anything Twilight or Stephenie Meyer related- I'm just dissappointed is all. I read Fanfic's constantly while waiting for BD to be released- and I liked some of them better...I thought Bella was going to have to do some thinking and sacrificing in this book? And Charlie with his 'need to know' attitude- just content on going allong with things. My daughter isn't hman anymore- oh well. I just don't get it...I could never say 'don't read this' or say it was terrible- it's just NOT what I expected. AT ALL.
031606792X|4.0|This will be full of spoilers...    Ok, here is the thing...    There were a lot of ways this book could have gone, which is the real reason behind the hype.  Team Jacob, Team Edward, will she be a vampire, will she have special powers, will they have sex, yada yada yada...    Meyers went in a direction that I absolutely did not bet on.  True, there was a lot of chatter about pregnancy, but I was among the majority of people who were of the opinion that it could not happen.  So as Breaking Dawn developed into a plot centralized around the pregnancy, I was...well, shocked!  Not to mention that Bella's fixation with a baby that was growing at a grotesque rate, literally breaking her bones, starving her and turning her black and blue was totally disturbing.  All the while, Edward, Jake and Carlise kept calling Nessie (don't get me started on the name) It, the monster and the fetus.  It was truly like something out of the Exorcist.  The image that stuck in my mind was the zombie movie that came out not that long ago, in which a pregnant woman becomes a totally gross zombie and has a zombie baby.  Not hot!    And I was expecting a monster, but no, she is a perfect angel!  After the creepy pregnancy, I was again, shocked!  And once again, totally disturbed by the whole imprinting thing, although Meyers works hard not to make it creepy.  I think she mostly succeeded after the shock wears off.      BUT!  All and all?  I was pretty entertained.  I read the two great reviews on this page about the message to young girls, and about sacrifice being nullified because everyone gets what they wants and ends up happily ever after.  But I have to say that I did not read this book, or any of the Twilight series for a potent message of honor, sacrifice, teen abstinence and all the other meanings that have been attached to it.  I read it because, as an avid reader, I like to be entertained.  I would compare this very much to the Harry Potter series, which I also read to be entertained.And let me tell you, as someone who works closely with kids, 99% of teens who \\"read\\" do not do it to get some deeper meaning.  They do it to be entertained too.    I think the main message of this book and all the other is that of \\"Love is beautiful and powerful in all forms\\", and yes, the classic, \\"Love conquers all\\".  Is it cheesy?  Yeah.  Is it deep?  Not really.  All those who are afraid that this final chapter is going to send a message to young girls that involves encouraging young marriage and teen pregnancy are reading too deep.  Come on guys!  This is a teen vampire romance book.  Anyone who reads romance, vampire or teen books does not usually look for much of a \\"deep\\" message.    So yeah, I was surprised, and disturbed at points.  But I really enjoyed this book, and frankly, was really happy with the ending.  I think I would have been devastated if it did not end happily, cause where's the fun in that?

0393324818|5.0|Baseball is a game that nerds can really enjoy, largely because of the availability of abundant and meaningful statistics.  Back in the 1970s the basic numbers could be obtained through books that were published every year, but a small group of super-geeks began looking more deeply into the mathematics of the game and developing their own metrics for rating players.  These guys were mostly self-taught statisticians and motivated entirely by an obsessive passion for the game.  I'm talking about people like Bill James, who a few decades ago was a security guard who began publishing really interesting and well-written analyses of baseball statistics in his famous Bill James Baseball Abstracts.    Of course baseball is also fun to watch, even for those who don't enjoy crunching numbers in their spare time.  That's why it's a multibillion dollar business, and that's where the influence of the Jamesians gets really interesting.  The thing is that for the sport's first 100 or so years the process of locating and recruiting talented players was based entirely on the gut instinct of the scouts employed by each team.  These guys were mostly ex-players who made decisions based on notions that had nothing to do with (and often conflicted completely with) the available evidence.  (The fact that the world is run almost entirely by people who think this way makes this book all the more insightful.)    Moneyball highlights the success of General Manager Billy Beane, who was able to run a very successful team for many years on a low budget by adapting the statistical approach.  Interestingly, Beane was a player who was highly touted by the old-school scouts who employed the conventional criteria (which apparently amounted to something like imagining how the player would look on a baseball card).  Beane's struggled throughout the 1990s to bring baseball into the 20th century, and he has had a substantial impact on the game, although any fan who watches the sport in 2008 will tell youthat old habits die hard.

I waited in line for it at midnight last night, read until 3:30 in the morning and finished it up today. I have to say it's NOTHING like what I was expecting... except I knew the Volturi would play into the plot somehow. I really loved it and thought Stephenie did a great job of twisting the plot so Bella and Edward COULD have it all. I especially loved seeing Bella in her role as a confident vampire and that for all her low self esteem as a human... as a vampire she KICKS BUTT! About time that Bella show's off her true talents.

031606792X|4.0|I left a detailed review already, stating that above all else, I loved the book. It's a great, entertaining read - very imaginative and daring. But there was so much hate on here for it that it compelled me to not mention the one thing that did bother me about the book, when I really wanted to, so I will add it here.    *SPOILER*    Jacob's POV - unnecessary. It was entertaining, and helped to make the story darker since we had no idea what was going on, but if I'm not mistaken, this story was about Edward and Bella from the very beginning. I just find it extremely odd and a little lacking in thought that when these two main characters, the human and the vampire, procreate, when no one thought they could, not even them - this was a miraculous event, mind you - we got not one word from them on what they thought about the whole thing. No \\"omg, what happened?\\" moment, no sweet conversation, no passing thoughts, no epiphany, no bonding conversation, no thoughts from Edward on the fact that he never, in a hundred years, thought he would ever be a father, NOTHING. Instead, we got Jacob's shallow observations (not to mention the same whiny triangle nonsense - sort of). The two main characters - now a married couple - experience a life-changing event, one in which they never could have anticipated over three books, and we get not one thought from them on the matter. We were too busy listening to a pointless conversation between Jacob and Leah - pointless because it went no where. I feel jipped suddenly.     When asked, Stephenie promised repeatedly that this book would be NOT from Jacob's POV - and I will paraphrase here - that Bella would get to finish telling her story. Well, she lied. One of the most important moments of Bella's story, one of the most important events of her life, Stephenie gives to Jacob (along with giving him Edward and Bella's only child), and let's him tell it from his skewed, biased point of view. I feel like Bella got jipped here, too. Along with Edward.     And then even once the kid was born, there were so few private moments between the small family. Why? Because we were too busy reading about Jacob again, and how he disturbingly imprinted on the child. I don't understand why Stephenie let her obsession with the character of Jacob take over Edward and Bella's story, making her break her promises to her fans, and to Bella - her first heroine. It's just all very unfortunate.    I wasn't going to her low stars and be mean like these other people, who are doing nothing but throwing tantrums. The third book from Bella's POV mostly made up for the complete stinginess of Edward/Bella scenes in the second book from Jacob's, and brought us to a great ending. I will not hold my extreme disappointment on the above mentioned matter against Stephenie - overall, the book was absolutely fantastic, but I did want to voice it.     Thank you.
031606792X|2.0|Like so many others here, I was very disappointed in this book. I never saw the \\"feminist\\" aspect in Bella, but if anyone else ever did, it is lost here. I suppose most of my discontent is in the \\"fairytale\\" ending- where everyone gets to be happy forever. One thing I enjoyed about the previous three books in the series was the reinforced concept that decisions lead to consequences, such as:    1. It was always clear that Bella chose Edward, and in so doing was giving up other aspects of human life- children and family; to me, those options were only viable if she chose Jacob.  It seemed like a cop out.     2. These two men, Edward and Jacob, are in love with Bella. She makes her choice, and someone is going to get hurt. I realize this is fiction, but I liked that for once not everyone was going to live in perfect bliss for all eternity. It never works that way.    I was impressed with the recurring theme of compromise in the series. Yet with this book, on one has to compromise anything- life, love, or happiness. I always liked that Bella wasn't the typical insipid female intent on a husband and 2.5 kids- she adamantly resisted matrimony for three books, that she is not THAT girl. Then with the pregnancy we see her become a completely different person, and give up EVERYTHING else that she was and happily becomes her own worst nightmare. I wish I had stopped reading after book one.

There were twists and turns that totally took me by surprise.  I tried to go into it with no expectations.  I just wanted to hear how Stephenie's dream finally ended.  And because I had no expectation, I wasn't disappointed at all!  On the contrary, I was in a fantasy land and my only regret was that I had to come back to reality when it was over.  I love happy endings and this book certainly delivered a happy ending and nicely tied up all the loose ends in the saga!  Way to go Stephenie Meyer... thanks for all the magic!!

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Portishead has always kind of had a bit of a \\"dinner party\\" sound to it, the kind of music you can play in the background at a party and it be recieved well. Beth Gibbon's singing and lyrics of profound uncertainty, little claustrophobic feelings of unrest and  lonliness are haunting, charming even nostalgic...     Third takes on a different sound opening with Silence there's still the sense of haunting and claustrophobia but the sound is more desperate, more active, the rest of the album is undeniably Portishead, but you'll hear more samples, more effects, more dischordant activity and while a good album I feel it should be treated as a separate work from Dummy and Self Titled this album has a distinct sound to itself.

031606792X|2.0|I was so hooked by the Twilight Saga until now. What the heck is up with Breaking Dawn? The book took a totally weird turn with Renesme and the Voltori and Jacob imprinting on a baby fresh out of the womb. Is Stephenie Meyer crazy or just in a rush to finish this book.
031606792X|1.0|\\"Breaking Dawn,\\" the long-awaited final installment in Stephenie Meyer's vampire love saga, \\"Twilight,\\" is a disappointing finish for several reasons. First, for those who haven't read the book yet, I'll cover points that don't contain plot spoilers, and then we'll move on to specifics. Note: I also write romance novels (am agent-shopping for the most recently finished, and starting another this month), so this is going to be a more technical review.     First, Meyer breaks the Number One rule of both gaming and sci-fi/fantasy writing: Never, ever break the rules that define your universe. Every good Dungeon Master knows that for your players to have a good experience, you must create and define the rules for your characters' abilities, actions, what they can and cannot do, etc. Meyer flagrantly breaks her own rules and then provides lame, after-thought excuses and rationales. This will not sit well with an audience composed of the very readers most obsessed with the keeping of such rules: Gamers, hard-core fantasy/sci-fi readers, and crazed fans who've spent years believing that vampires simply can't produce viable sperm.     Second: While Meyer is obviously a much better writer technically than she was at the outset, she creates accelerated, implausible growth arcs for her main characters, piles one unbelievable, bizarre, and shocking plot twist upon another in rapid-fire fashion, twists beyond belief the very relationships upon which the fabric of her story is built, and then sugar-coats it with the sappiest of endings. It's all too much to swallow, especially when it goes on for 700+ pages. Where, oh, where, were her editors when all this was happening?     Third: Yes, it's a wild ride, full of surprises. Yes, there's a happy ending -- for everyone. But the integrity of characters and story seems to have been severely compromised to achieve this. Well-crafted, good literature and piles of reader wish-fulfillment do not always go hand-in-hand. More often than not, they diverge. Writers must walk a fine line to achieve the best of both worlds. It's a goal that not everyone masters.     OK, now for specifics. SPOILERS AHEAD. You've been warned.   1. Since Meyer is constrained by her religious beliefs, we don't get any believable intimacy between Bella and Edward after the wedding. What we do get is wedding-night trepidation (sooo out-of-character for Bella!), followed by an instant pregnancy that technically can't occur by the author's own oft-repeated rule that vampires can't make viable sperm. Wow! You would think Carlisle, at least, being both MD and avid researcher, would've Googled up some research or read some ancient myths about incubi and succubi to check out the possibilities -- and maybe prescribed some birth control just in case. But nooo...  2. Edward first wants his new bride to have an abortion. This makes no sense. At that point what can he be afraid of? Then, later, he asks Jacob, the losing member of their little love triangle, to hop in bed with Bella and do her so she can get pregnant with \\"normal\\" babies and thus be fulfilled. True to LDS doctrine, a woman just can't be happy without a bun in the oven, and a few more kids gnawing on the woodwork. Whatever it takes...  3. Bella becomes instantly obsessed with the baby, and is ready to suffer and die for it. Given the fact that she didn't really care about procreating BEFORE she got married, and the fact that all this happens instantly, it's rather unbelievable. She's all of EIGHTEEN years old at this point!   4. No sex, no intimacy, but graphic descriptions of the overplayed agony of gestation and birth, are what we get. There's more gratuitous blood than a \\"House\\" episode. What, was she taking notes at Relief Society meetings where women rehash their traumatic birth stories like they're competing for religious gold medals? Yeah, it's a more \\"grown-up\\" book than the others, but this was way over-the-top.  5. The mutant baby also violates a lot of known rules in the \\"Twilight\\" universe. Credibility dies faster than Bella does after the birth.   6. Jacob imprints on little Nessie, Edward and Bella's daughter. BAD IDEA. Now they really can be one big, happy family, just like those folks on that ranch in Texas. He used to fantasize about Bella naked and pregnant with his babies, now just see what he's got to look forward to with Nessie after he finishes fathering a couple of her half-siblings! He won't even have to wait that long, because she'll reach maturity by age 7. This just doesn't work on any level, except maybe for incestual polygamists.   8. The stand-off with the Volturi is anti-climactic. All that build-up, and no fight? Come on!   9. Fairy-godmother endings after all this? Complete with ivy-covered Snow White cottage in the woods? No loss, no sacrifice, no compromise, no balance. Tolkien, Lewis, Jordan, or Rowling didn't disgrace themselves with such endings. I didn't know whether to throw up or go take a long shower, so I settled for rereading Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden.\\"     Why doesn't anyone write like that anymore?
B0000CBHOI|1.0|Blues is a genre of music that is greatly under-appreciated by most Americans, despite being the fundamental roots and building blocks of all other forms of music, minus the Old-Timey music which was created by Western European immigrants in the Appalachians and down south, though even that music mingled with the Blues; the perfect example being \\"John Henry\\", which was hugely popular in both black Blues traditions and in Old-Timey music. Jazz, Rock 'N' Roll, Soul, Hard Rock and Heavy Metal all borrow heavily from the Blues. Though I am only 25 years of age, I have been a major Blues fan for over ten years. When I say \\"major\\", I mean that I am an obsessive collector, fan, singer and have just started to learn how to play the acoustic guitar. When I saw this documentary on television when it originally aired, I was disappointed. Upon renting the dvds from my local library three or four months ago, I was even more disappointed. It'd be much easier to tell one what's WRONG with this documentary than what's RIGHT about it.<br />  Firstly, Corey Harris is a wonderful musician, but his original compositions and the Country Blues classics which he covers have nothing to do with musicians in Mali. Although that (very long!) segment of the film was interesting, it didn't pertain to the subject matter at all. It's nice to hear that someone thinks John Lee Hooker's music is \\"African\\", but what exactly does that mean? His music is meditative, hypnotic and sexual, but when we look up \\"Africa\\" or \\"African music\\" in an encyclopedia, we don't see \\"meditative\\", \\"hypnotic\\", or \\"sexual\\", do we? I think this is just the romanticism of a bunch of middle-aged whites who worked on this dvd, and perhaps even some of the young black musicians. With that said, it's great that Harris is in the documentary, as he is one of the top three greatest living Bluesmen. Alvin Youngblood Hart is also present in a different episode of this documentary, but why is he never interviewed? He is the best, that is, he is #1, out of all the living Blues musicians. His guitar playing is fantastic, he is able to compose songs which sound like they are from Charley Patton in 1928 but which contain all original lyrics, and his voice has an accent and snap to it that sounds like a real Country Bluesman from the '20s or '30s. In addition to Hart and Harris being shown covering important songs from the past, Samuel James and John Hammond should have been included in this documentary. John Hammond has done more to spread the word about real Blues than any other person alive, for the last half-century, and his brilliant father did the same thing during his long life. It's deeply insulting that John wasn't included. Furthermore, the artists who WERE shown performing classic Blues songs are simply Godawful. Beck's reading of Skip James' \\"I'm So Glad\\" is the most horrendous, disgusting, laughable thing I've ever seen in my life. Keb' Mo is a lightweight and not a Bluesman; he sounds more like James Taylor than he does like Big Joe Williams. Also, Skip James did not re-record all of his 1931 classics, as this stupid documentary would have you believe. This is just poor research on the part of the people who produced this monstrosity. Bonnie Raitt turned in a considerably good performance. Los Lobos and Susan Tedeschi had no business being part of the project, just as Susan didn't belong on Buddy Guy's newest album. I have seen her live; she is very good at playing Blues licks on her guitar and she's a good singer, but she is not Blues. Chuck D. makes an absolute ass of himself, along with his rapper friends, and Marshall Chess shows that he has no taste in music, and can't distinguish good Blues from crap. The footage of Skip James and the discussion of James' life and career by Dick Waterman is the highlight of this entire project and is wonderfully done. The J.B. Lenior business was ridiculous, as the private tapes of him performing show his limited talents on the guitar. The episode about the young man going to live with his uncle is utterly ridiculous because few blacks in the south at that time knew who Robert Johnson was, though the uncle supposedly touts him as one of the greatest of all-time, and even fewer blacks or people in general had any understanding of the greatness of the Blues as a serious musical form, like we think of Classical music, or Jazz, these days. So, why would the uncle have a shrine dedicated to Blues and be a Blues historian?!?. \\"Sleepy\\" John Estes is mistakenly called \\"Sleepy\\" Joe Estes. If Ken Burns' \\"Jazz\\" documentary were to call Thelonious Monk, \\"Thelonious Blunk\\", can you imagine the outrage on the part of the Jazz community? Bobby Rush is a joke and isn't a Blues artist. He should stay on the chitlin circuit, doing his dirty dances and poor James Brown imitations. I have no idea why he was included in this documentary. Also, although we all love and respect B.B. King, perhaps we didn't need to see him sitting on his tour bus, talking about his love for the Blues for an extended period of time, but this is one of the minor things wrong with this atrocious documentary.<br /> The British episode of this abomination is ridiculous, due to Lulu and Tom Jones' presence. Honestly, Mayall and Baldry are of very little importance to Blues and we didn't need to hear about and from them, over and over again. If there needed to be a British \\"Blues\\"-themed episode to this disgrace of a documentary, why not focus on the lives of Clapton, the early Fleetwood Mac, Jeff Beck, and, more importantly, their influences, and why they (the British guitar players) love the Blues. Clint Eastwood's work is very well-done, but the problem is that very few of the musicians have anything to do with the Blues. Where was Roosevelt Sykes? He, in my opinion, was the greatest Blues pianist/singer in history. Dave Brubeck is a Jazz musician, and he doesn't even perform good Jazz; he does what Jelly Roll Morton or Joe Bussard would consider to be something other than Jazz, to put it nicely. The Johnny Shines footage in one of the earlier parts of this documentary was fantastic, but why wasn't the great Johnny Shines honored for what he truly was; a musician every bit as good as Robert Johnson, with a stronger and more versatile voice than Johnson, and the ability to perform both acoustic Country Blues standards and originals, and electric Chicago-style Blues standards and originals with equal force and beauty? When, oh, when, will Johnny Shines be recognized? He was the last of the great Bluesmen. He belongs up there with Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, Blind Blake, Blind Willie McTell, Blind Willie Johnson, Skip James, and, perhaps, Alvin Youngblood Hart, who should have had a much more prominent role here. It would have been better to have a dry, historical reading of the story of the Blues, even if the directors and producers didn't know their stuff (which was obviously the case) than to have a mish-mash of different segments, done by different fools, with, and this is the really awful part, horrible performances by living, supposed \\"Blues\\" or Blues-influenced \\"artists\\". I am able to sing these old classic Blues songs better than any of these morons, minus the great Hart, Harris and Bonnie Raitt. I believe it was the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion that was the low-point of this entire documentary, though it's really hard to discern what the worst part of this walking disaster was. Lou Reed, Oscar Peterson, Dr. John; why are they a part of this documentary? There was plenty of great Son House footage here, but why wasn't Blind Willie McTell mentioned? What about the unique Henry \\"Ragtime Texas\\" Thomas, who sounds nothing like anyone in all of American music, and who was an important Songster who came before the Blues, along with the brilliant Luke Jordan and the heavenly Richard \\"Rabbit\\" Brown?<br />  I am not a huge fan of Eric Clapton, but the discussion of white teenagers' embracing the Blues during the 1960s and '70s is very important to the history of the Blues. With that being said, instead of having talentless artists who happen to be white covering Blues classics, it would have been better to sit down with Eric Clapton for one hour and just have him talk about the records he loved growing up, right off the top of his head. This would also help de-bunk the myth that \\"Clapton is God\\", and show young guitar-playing-Clapton-obsessed Blues-Rockers out there that Eric doesn't think he's the best; he feels he can never equal Muddy Waters' greatness, not to mention the beauty of Skip James or Robert Johnson. As Clapton has said in various interviews with various magazines, he is incapable of playing solo acoustic Country Blues because he is not a good enough player to play the complete guitar accompaniment to a song, which is what men like Blind Blake and Blind Lemon Jefferson did. This is why Clapton's album of Robert Johnson covers has other musicians on it. Finally, where the hell is the virtuoso of the Blues, Lonnie Johnson? This man was the inventor of Jazz guitar, performed marvelous guitar duets with Eddie Lang that still sound unbelievable almost 100 years laters, accompanied the brilliantly talented Texas Alexander by playing some of the most startling, dazzling, ominous guitar work in the history of mankind, pioneered Rhythm & Blues ten years later, and was able to play and croon Pop music standards with the best of them. I could probably go on and on about the inaccuracies and mistakes associated with this sad disappointment of a documentary, but I will have to stop here. Rent this thing from your local library. Do not buy it under any circumstances! If you want to know what Blues cds you should buy or which artists you should check out, just ask me, and I will tell you. I will save you a lot of money and aggravation, which is something that this documentary won't be able to do!e something other than Jazz, to put it nicely. The Johnny Shines footage in one of the earlier parts of this documentary was fantastic, but why wasn't the great Johnny Shines honored for what he truly was; a musician every bit as good as Robert Johnson, with a stronger and more versatile voice than Johnson, and the ability to perform both acoustic Country Blues standards and originals, and electric Chicago-style Blues standards and originals with equal force and beauty? When, oh, when, will Johnny Shines be recognized? He was the last of the great Bluesmen. He belongs up there with Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton, Robert Johnson, Blind Blake, Blind Willie McTell, Blind Willie Johnson, Skip James, and, perhaps, Alvin Youngblood Hart, who should have had a much more prominent role here. It would have been better to have a dry, historical reading of the story of the Blues, even if the directors and producers didn't know their stuff (which was obviously the case) than to have a mish-mash of different segments, done by different fools, with, and this is the really awful part, horrible performances by living, supposed \\"Blues\\" or Blues-influenced \\"artists\\". I am able to sing these old classic Blues songs better than any of these morons, minus the great Hart, Harris and Bonnie Raitt. I believe it was the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion that was the low-point of this entire documentary, though it's really hard to discern what the worst part of this walking disaster was. Lou Reed, Oscar Peterson, Dr. John; why are they a part of this documentary? There was plenty of great Son House footage here, but why wasn't Blind Willie McTell mentioned? What about the unique Henry \\"Ragtime Texas\\" Thomas, who sounds nothing like anyone in all of American music, and who was an important Songster who came before the Blues, along with the brilliant Luke Jordan and the heavenly Richard \\"Rabbit\\" Brown?<br />  I am not a huge fan of Eric Clapton, but the discussion of white teenagers' embracing the Blues during the 1960s and '70s is very important to the history of the Blues. With that being said, instead of having talentless artists who happen to be white covering Blues classics, it would have been better to sit down with Eric Clapton for one hour and just have him talk about the records he loved growing up, right off the top of his head. This would also help de-bunk the myth that \\"Clapton is God\\", and show young guitar-playing-Clapton-obsessed Blues-Rockers out there that Eric doesn't think he's the best; he feels he can never equal Muddy Waters' greatness, not to mention the beauty of Skip James or Robert Johnson. As Clapton has said in various interviews with various magazines, he is incapable of playing solo acoustic Country Blues because he is not a good enough player to play the complete guitar accompaniment to a song, which is what men like Blind Blake and Blind Lemon Jefferson did. This is why Clapton's album of Robert Johnson covers has other musicians on it. Finally, where the hell is the virtuoso of the Blues, Lonnie Johnson? This man was the inventor of Jazz guitar, performed marvelous guitar duets with Eddie Lang that still sound unbelievable almost 100 years laters, accompanied the brilliantly talented Texas Alexander by playing some of the most startling, dazzling, ominous guitar work in the history of mankind, pioneered Rhythm & Blues ten years later, and was able to play and croon Pop music standards with the best of them. I could probably go on and on about the inaccuracies and mistakes associated with this sad disappointment of a documentary, but I will have to stop here. Rent this thing from your local library.

031606792X|5.0|I have found over the course of reading the Stephenie Meyer books that she has become more and more adept at creating a story full of emotion, grit and most importantly, romance.  Breaking Dawn is no exception.  Although darker then her first three, I found it very enjoyable to read.      It is true that a reader may not always agree with what the final product is, but isn't that the true joy of reading?  To be surprised and entertained.  I truly enjoyed the surprises in this book, whether I agreed with them or not is beside the point.  The writer is the creator of a story, and Stephanie Meyers has created a wonderful piece of art.
B0013USZHG|5.0|The first reviewer has absolutely NO idea what he is talking about and obviously does not know anything about music!!! Please IGNORE HIM and forgive him for his ignorance. The Simon Bolivar Orquestra in Dudamel's hands is without doubt, one of the most impressive works done in the world of classical music. Dudamel is a genius of the size of Mozart and we have the privilege of having him is our times. This CD has an immense value, not only for the magnificent performance of he orquestra and the way they transmit the essence of latin America through their music, but also because of the success of a UNIQUE music education program that takes place in Venezuela and that gives birth to the best musicians of the world. Having this CD is a privilege that will delight your ears and an open window to the heart of Latin America.
B000096IBI|5.0|\\"Modern Times\\" is one of Charlie Chaplin's most memorable films. In this movie, the Tramp joins the ranks of the unemployed, and eventually teams up with a poor girl (Paulette Goddard) who's trying to make her way in the world. Like all Chaplin films, \\"Modern Times\\" features numerous slapstick routines that are just as funny today as they were 80 years ago when this film was made. This is one of the first Chaplin films that uses recorded sound effects and even some spoken dialogue in the form of a nonsense song, which was Chaplin's way of lashing out at talking motion pictures. Chaplin also composed the score to this movie, which includes \\"Smile,\\" one of Chaplin's most famous songs. This is a truly fantastic film that people will continue to enjoy for many years to come.
1419551795|3.0|This book is good for some extra questions, but it by no means contains the hardest questions.  Like numerous other reviewers of GMAT books have mentioned, the best prep is to use the official GMAT book.  For the toughest questions, I would recommend doing the two tests you can download for free from mba.com when you sign up.  Do those tests multiple times because while some questions remain the same, the majority change.  If you get better, you'll get to the harder questions.  The questions in the Kaplan GMAT 800 are of moderate difficulty.  They may be somewhat hard from a straight math point of view, but the questions on the actual GMAT are slightly different and trickier in nature.  As far as the strategies go, there were a couple useful ones, although they may seem obvious to some.  So, to summarize, this book is a decent supplement, but don't think you'll be getting an outstanding score just because you can answer the questions in this book.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I'll review the DVD set itself, not the short-lived series.  The show itself has been discussed plenty in other reviews of this DVD set and numerous other sources, such as the excellent website mscl.com .<br /><br />As far as this DVD set is concerned, there's not much more you could ask for.  All 19 episodes are here in their entirety, with excellent video and sound.  There are six DVD's, five contain the episodes and the sixth is cast interviews, background video, music and photos.  Little Danielle grew up!  About 1/3 of the episodes have voice overs from some case members, the series creator, and various writers, producers and directors.<br /><br />It is completely worth the money even if you just casually liked the show.  Hard to believe it's been 14 years.  This set will remind you what a great show it was and what a budding star they had in Clair Danes.<br /><br />It's hard to find something to not like about it.  Jared Leto is a no-show in the extra features and voice-overs, and I think he's the most interesting cast member.  During the voice-overs I find myself mumbling to myself \\"Say something already!\\".  They clearly haven't seen the episodes themselves in many years and they keep getting caught up in watching the show instead of talking about it.  And the interviews are a little heavy on introspection about how the show came about and what it meant and a little light on how the series was actually put together.  I love seeing audition segments and out-takes, and there are none here.<br /><br />Back to the good stuff:  There's an excellent paperback book with the set, giving background on each episode and talking about what would have happened in season 2, if there had been one.  The music in the series was super and I enjoyed hearing it again.<br /><br />In summary, it's about as good as it gets for a boxed set of a TV season.  I had a great time watching it this summer and remembering what a wonderful show it was.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Try samples of Reznor's NIN album and make believe that power of this awesome music can fly inside of the body and it's powerful. In my central european country Poland NIN is known as a masterpiece of industrial sound. That's why I recommend NIN's With_Teeth. This music drives me almost nine years. Go with it, U won't regret. It always smells fresh.
031606792X|3.0|I love all of the twilight books and I couldn't wait to get this book. I picked the release date as the delivery and it was horrible. I thought the book would at least come in the morning, but no it is after 5pm and I still have not received my shipment yet.
031606792X|2.0|This was a very disappointing last book.    I feel that there was certain things that were focused on that really did not have to do with Bella and the big picture. There was to much time spent focusing on \\"the honeymoon\\" and everything that goes along with it.    I really want to know.....what was Meyer thinking when she wrote this book??    I ADORED the other books in the series and was excited to read this book. When I finally finished I was like..\\"this is it??\\"!! There are so many things that were not cleared up still after about 800 something pages!
0517548232|1.0|Based on other people's reviews, I thought this would be a fairly straightforward book that a person with a graduate degree but no background in economics (such as myself) would find easy to understand. That was definitely not the case, for a number of reasons.    First, the writing is not at all impressive. I know economists are not reputed to be particularly good writers, but come on, get yourself a good editor! Some of the sentences were so wordy and poorly constructed that I had to read them several times to figure out how the writer would have written them if he knew how to write at all. And THEN I had to figure out what the sentence said in terms of expanding my knowledge of economics. It was tedious, to say the least.    Additionally, the organization of the text within the chapters needs a significant amount of work. The chapters meander; if you are the type of person who likes to organize a chapter's contents into a mental outline as you read, good luck. This author clearly didn't start with an outline, mental or otherwise. It's like he developed each chapter based on chats he had in his living room, which he asked someone to transcribe, then chunked up into paragraphs and called it done.    The author also doesn't do a good job of explaining what different terms mean. What's the difference between a tax, a tariff, and a duty? Darned if I know, and I read about two-thirds of this book before deciding it definitely wasn't worth my time.    I also found the content he describes in his chapters to be somewhat outdated. It's hard to get a grasp of economics when you're trying to relate what you know about how a particular system works in the present to the way he's discussing it as working in the past. As I mentioned, I have no background in economics, so I have no way of knowing whether the particular system he's discussing has undergone a massive overhaul at some point, such that the system he's describing no longer bears any resemblance to the system I know.If you can't figure out how to integrate what you're reading into your existing knowledge base, you can't expect to expand your knowledge base.    I also wish the author were more up-front about his political bent from the outset, as this would have helped me to interpret what he was saying in the context of my own political views.    Overall, I do not recommend this book at all. Maybe I'd have a different take if I had read it for a class I was taking, so that the instructor could fill in the blanks and help put certain things into context. But just reading it on my own, with no background in economics to draw on, was pointless.    I'm going to try naked economics next. Reviews seem to indicate that it's written by an economist who can actually write.
B0013URJTG|4.0|Thank you Steven Wilson and company for providing more Porcupine Tree music which I find I must have periodically to exist musically. Since Fear of A Blank Planet, I have been yearning for more and I'm sorry to say Nil Recurring did not do it for me. This recording is a very nice mellow album heavey on acoustic guitar which is a triumph from the English lads. Bravo! Lightbulb Sun gives us some really solid tunes in How Is Your Life Today (shades of the Beatles), Shesmovedon (a personal favorite), The Rest Will Flow, Russia On Ice (with its slow build up and epic length at 13:03)and the catchy \\"Hatesong\\". I highly recommend this album to any Porcupine Tree fans or folks tired of the same old radio BS being \\"manufactured\\" to sell cars and fast food. Ciao.
031606792X|2.0|I have to be honest, I was one of the hordes on hand Friday night for the midnight release of Breaking Dawn.  I'm quite a bit older than the target audience of the series, but I've always been a huge fan of teen fiction.  I devoured the first three books, taking only a day to read each of them.  I thought that no matter how the final book ended, nothing could make me love this series less.  I was wrong.    The thing I loved most about this series was that even though it involved vampires and werewolves, it seemed to me to be first and foremost a love story, with all that paranormal stuff secondary.  The reason I think it captivated so many people is that everyone wants to be loved the way that Edward loved Bella.  To me, that is exactly the problem with the last book.    I don't mind the pregnancy or the child (although I did find it creepy).  I can live with Jacob imprinting and the Volturi standoff.  My problem with the book was that the characters were so one-dimensional that all that emotional stuff was gone forever.  If someone were to pick up the last book without reading any of the others, do you think they would get that Bella and Edward loved each other so desperately?  I truly don't.  She acted as though she loved Jacob more.  I mean, when they thought they were going to die, Rosalie and Emmett share a kiss, and Edward and Bella do nothing?  That summed up the entire book for me.      I also read that SM had trouble getting the publisher to let her write four books.  There was so many more events in BD than in previous books.  Maybe if it had been broken into two books, the character development that I sorely miss could have been included.  Why couldn't the marriage and pregnancy be the beginning, with the birth and Volturi the finale?  Maybe that would have given SM the time she needed to make this book the quality that the first three were.      I don't know what I'm going to say to my kids (I\\"m a librarian).  I have been preaching about this series forso long, and I don't know what to say now.  Part of me just wants to tell them to read the first three and stop.  While I may reread the first three over and over again, I don't think I'll ever read BD again.  I feel so cheated and sad that such a great love story went out with a whimper, instead of a bang.
031606792X|1.0|***Feel Safe. No Plot Specific Spoliers!***<br />As a die hard Twilight fan I am dissappointed with Breaking Dawn. Chapters 1-4 are in typical Twilight mode and feels like a continuation of the series. Then slowly in chapter 5 the characters we know so well become diluted and we are expected to believe this wild ride we are taken on. I think there was so much focus on the plot and getting everything to the finish line that the essence of the characters were sacrificed. As I was reading I kept mourning the perfection of scences like the meadow or their first car ride together.<br />I think most readers need to be prepared that this book is very plot driven and is no way driven by the characters like in the past. By itself it is a fun, wild ride of a read but not as a part of the series.
031606792X|4.0|As a teenage girl I am surprised and pretty offended at the way people are talking about Breaking Dawn. Not about the bad reviews. Everyone is free to have their own opinion about books and the like. No, I'm talking about all the people who talk about teenage girls as if all of them are stupid enough to think that this is real life. Yes, in the book Edward Cullen is very appealing and (I'm not going to lie) fun to think about. However, I, along with all the other teenage girls I know who've read these books, know that he isn't real. We know that falling in love with an immortal and dangerous being would not be a good move. We also know that the \\"perfect\\" man (like Edward, mortal or immortal) just doesn't exist. Everyone has flaws.   Also, these people are talking about feminism and how there's more to life than just getting married and having babies. But isn't part of feminism the power for women to make choices?   Continuing on the subject of the way teenage girls will respond to this book. I know that there are girls out there who will react the way that people are afraid that we'll ALL react but if there are I think that these books are not the only thing to blame. We cannot blame four books for the way people see the world. If the only thing that's influencing these girls are these books then maybe the problem lies somewhere else.  Review-wise I found Breaking Dawn fun and satisfying (even though the first fifth was pretty mushy I still enjoyed it). I would like to remind everyone that this is a fairy tale and not a self-help book. For a fairy tale it was a ton of fun!
B000A88EV4|5.0|\\"What's it like being you?\\"- A classic line if ever there was one.<br /><br />You have probably never seen a movie quite like Naked.  It begins with a random rape scene and it ends..., well let's just say it doesn't so much end, as the movie finishes.<br /><br />Naked gives you a tour of the dark underbelly of London as seen through the eyes of Johnny, an anti-hero if there ever was one.  An intellectual who is on the run from.., life? the law? his own demons? You can't really say.<br /><br />The dialogue is fascinating, the scenes bleak as you view the desolation and wasteland of both London and the characters lives.<br /><br />It all takes place over the course of a day or two, and when I was finished watching it, I sat with my mouth agape for several minutes as my brain continued to process what I had just seen.<br /><br />Kudos to Mike Leigh for making a film where the characters truly dominate, and where you really, really, really need to pay attention to understand what appears to be going on.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B000RL61Y6|5.0|I recently bought this DVD set with audio DVD.....the audio disc of George, Bob, Tom, and Roy, recording the music of the Traveling Wilburys was truly amazing!  You wont regret spending the money for this set...not only is the music great, but seeing them recording was a special treat for a die hard Beatle freak!!!
031606792X|1.0|I think the biggest disappointment about the book for me was it was no longer Bella's story or Edward's story even, it became Nessie's story. The entire plot and all the characters' interactions revolved around her to the point where I was like \\"Ok, yes, but what else?<br /><br />I know Stephanie is a proud mother and perhaps wanted to convey the kind of power and love you feel as a mother, but for the majority of the audience (pretty young girls), its not something they can relate to, or find interesting. To be honest, I read the books for Edward and Bella, their love, their sacrifices and everything they do for that.<br /><br />I felt like the entire book was a cop out. It was all neatly wrapped up in a present, bow and all. No one died, practically no one suffered. Bella got everything she wanted and more, with little lost. She didn't lose Jacob, her family, Edward, anyone. She didnt even have to suffer being a newborn. I just wanted so much for this book to be about Bella's sacrifices in life to pursuing her love of Edward, and I feel really let down. :(
B0012BQ36G|1.0|I gave up on this book after drearily trudging through 3 chapters of a writing style that is hard to read. Tolle's Q&A format results in a choppy, disjointed lecture in which concepts are introduced without sufficient background or explanation. For examele, Tolle immediately lumps all thinking together. The reading would have been facilitated if Tolle had laid out early on a reasonable distinction between useful and useless thinking.    Other concepts are also poorly introduced (Being, One Life, Identification with Mind) and leave the reader wondering what Tolle is talking about.     Much of Tolle's obfuscational verbiage offers old ideas dressed up in new words. After 3 chapters, I stopped wondering what he was talking about and donated my copy to the Salvation Army.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i was really worried when i was reading some negative reviews. i loved the books so much they had to end great.  and i was not disappointed.  the people that hated this book are crazy.  it was a fitting end to a beautiful love story.
031606792X|1.0|I am a huge fan of the first three books in the series, just as many of you are. I was looking forward to wrapping up this sagga of these starcrossed lovers, but now I see I was wrong. After reading this book, I realize my imagination will have to work overtime to repair the unjust damage this book has inflicted upon the entire series. As far as I am concerned, Eclipse is the last book in this set and I will use my own mind to create an ending that is actually worthy of the characters and their choices.
031606792X|4.0|I will admit, before I started reading this the day after it came out, I was on here reading reviews.  I read the spoilers, along with the good reviews.  All I have to say is this, it is a good book.  Stephanie Meyer is a new writer who has indeed fallen into a few newbie traps.  The books (all of them) are a little over-adjectivized, and in this book in particular, she tried to cram so much in to tie up the loose ends, that it does drag a bit towards the end.  All of that said, I really really liked the book.  There are a few things that stretch her created world a little, but they are all done with finesse, and plausibility.  She is true to the characters, and to all of the detractors who complain that Bella changes, what really happens is that she grows up and matures.  Something most of us hope to do with grace.  The bottom line is that the story is good (not as good as the first three) and you can almost hear the characters breath as you read.  Anyone who liked the first three of these will enjoy this good read.
031606792X|5.0|I loved it! My second favorite (Twilight still my fav!) I totally do not understand why some did not care for it! I am baffled by it! I thought it had alot of unexpected plot twists and surprises (I LOVE SURPRISES!) I have decided to write out exactly what I loved about it! Be warned spoilers below.        1. I loved the wedding! I was annoyed in with her reluctance to marry him (Who wouldn't want to marry him???) but was very pleased when she saw him and was happy and not just going through the motions.    2. I loved the honeymoon! It seemd very real and true to the characters (also funny at parts) but didn't get raunchy or anything!    3. I loved the pregnancy surprise totally not what I was expecting?  I loved the suspense created by wondering what the heck was in there and what the child would be like?    4. Love the birth/vamp conversion scene! Whoa that was intense! Iloved the creativity of the syringe full of venom stabbed in her heart! Loved that it was Edward and Jacob who had to deliver the baby and then try to save Bella (would not have been as intense had it been Carlise)    5. Loved Bella as a Vampire! Enough said    6. In the 3 previous books its was all about everyone and their momma trying to save Bella and I loved that it was her in the end that saved everyone else! I always saw Bella as the true hero of the books only held back by her frail human state so I was thrilled by this angle!    7.Last but not least I loved the fairytale ending! I loved that they got their cake and were able to eat it too so to speak! It felt like that was exactly how it was meant to be all along.    I will agree that this book was very different from the other three! It felt far removed somehow like it took place several years down the road from Eclipse not several months. There were a few things that bothered me a bit like the imprinting and the child's name but other than that I really really enjoyed it!
0316143472|3.0|I'll confess that short story and essay collections take me forever to read, they're just too easy to put down.  Also, my affections for Sedaris run hot and cool; he's funny, there's no getting around it.  However, I find that I tend to tire of his \\"little\\" stories when taken in large doses and prefer listening to Sedaris read his own work.  His storytelling gifts are prodigious, as well as idiosyncratic; no one can read Sedaris better than Sedaris.<br /><br />So, what's my opinion of this new collection?  Mixed; there is certainly a redundancy of themes and characters.  However, if you're a fan (and I am), you'll find this exactly as you'd expect. I skipped around and back and forth.  My favorite pieces were the masterful \\"This Old House,\\" \\"That's Amore\\" (you'll never forget Helen), \\"Old Faithful\\" and the final, novella length, \\"The Smoking Section.\\"  On the whole the collection is too long and not as strong as the sum of its parts. However, what works is vintage, making it well worth reading.
031606792X|5.0|Just finished \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and loved the book. (NO SPOILERS in this review). I felt no sense of disappointment in the outcomes of the characters I have grown to know and love over the series. In fact, I was extremely pleased with the outcome, it is exactly what I wanted (and more).<br /><br />I have read reviews complaining about the writing, and I'm not sure what that's all about. I see no difference in the writing style or language or syntax in this book from the first three books. I found the author's writing to be genuine and amusing.<br /><br />There also seems to be a lot of disatisfaction about how the stories are resolved. The bottom line is, there is no way to please every rabid fan. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book... it's entertaining fiction, what it was intended to be all along. It's a suitable ending for the series as told from Bella's perspective.<br /><br />Don't let the mixed reviews scare you away. The final book stays true to the series with a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />A final note: I find it kind of suspicious that not only are there so many 1 star reviews, but that most of the negative reviews got the \\"most helpful\\" votes while positive reviews were given the most \\"not helpful\\" votes. I realize there are some strong feelings about this series on both sides, but I also know Stephanie Meyer said in an interview that she reads the 1 star reviews on Amazon. HMMM....
B00003CX5P|3.0|Here it is -- the most maligned and controversial movie of its time; the one to receive the most ridiculously overblown hype before its release, as well as the most severe backlash afterwards; the film supposedly responsible for millions of dashed hopes, \\"raped childhoods\\", and perhaps even a suicide or two, according to all the internet gossip.         Personally, I never thought much of either the prerelease hype or the hysterical fanboy backlash -- whatever its faults, this movie is not worth getting so upset over.  There was simply no way ANY film could have lived up to the overblown expectations heaped upon this one. And those people whose lives were \\"ruined\\" or \\"raped\\" by this movie probably already had serious personal issues to begin with...         Having said all that, the film does have its fair share of problems.  I did like it when I first saw it in the theater, and I was eagerly awaiting the next chapter when I walked out.  Looking back, I probably liked it more for what it COULD have been, rather than for what was actually up on the screen.  The Star Wars universe is always a fun place to visit, and I think -- contrary to all the conspiracy theories -- that George Lucas meant well, and really did what he thought was best for the series at that point.  There were some good IDEAS here that had potential, but Lucas unfortunately had trouble forging them into a compelling MOVIE.         Perhaps the biggest problems stemmed from the different circumstances under which this movie was made, versus the original films.  When the first Star Wars came out, Lucas had no idea whether any sequels would even be made; the film had to stand on its own merits.  By contrast, Ep.I was made with the full knowledge that there would be two more films to follow; this could have unintentionally led Lucas to take more time developing his story and characters than he should have.  He evidently became more concerned with foreshadowing and setting up future stories than showing a compelling one in THIS film.  This resulted in a film that, unlike the originals, didn't stand too well on its own, and that depended too much on being a small part of the larger SW series for its appeal; indeed, a common complaint was that Ep.I was little more than a feature-length trailer for the rest of the prequel trilogy.         Another problem seems to be the inverse of what plagues most movie trilogies -- many series starting out strong only to lose focus as they go on, as if their creators know how to begin their stories but not how to end them.  With the SW prequel trilogy, Lucas seems to have the opposite problem; he knew how he wanted it to END (Anakin becomes Darth Vader), but not how exactly to BEGIN it.  Thus this series became more focused as it progressed, but began as an unfocused mess, to this film's detriment.         Add to this the script, which had the feel of a first draft that needed much more work before filming began.  While all the other SW films dealt with large conflicts spanning the galaxy, much of Ep.I focused on small, localized events that felt more like an abstract, throwaway plot merely to introduce the characters.  While I understand showing much of the developing conflicts growing out of seemingly mundane events that become larger and larger while spiralling out of control, Ep.I tended to dwell on trivial matters while rushing through others that should have been expanded upon.  There was too much talking and TELLING the audience about what happened, rather than SHOWING them. Take, for instance, the invasion of Naboo; we are TOLD the Naboo people were \\"suffering and dying\\", the death toll was \\"catastrophic\\", etc., but never SHOWN this -- no raging battles, no burning buildings or civilian casualties, etc.  Ditto for Anakin's life as a slave -- Lucas should have SHOWN us the brutality of slavery, with perhaps some deaths as a result, to make us FEEL Anakin's desire to leave for a better life.         Unfortunately, it seemsLucas tried to compensate with juvenile kiddie humor.  I understand that the film was supposed to convey the feel of the Republic in more \\"innocent\\" times, before the rise of the evil Empire; however, much of the humor here seems to have been mere filler, to pad and stretch out the already thin plot.  Too often, Lucas went for \\"campy\\" or \\"silly\\", to the point where it practically defined the movie itself.  The most obvious was Jar Jar; while his character did serve an important purpose in the film, Lucas didn't bother to make him sympathetic in the least -- there was no reason to believe the Jedi would want anything to do with him, or take him across the galaxy when he hardly \\"pulled his own weight\\", and continuously caused problems.  This \\"campy\\" trend extended to other characters as well -- the rival racers in the podrace, for example, came across like cartoonish puppets, instead of menacing alien opponents like they should have. And the battle droids of the Trade Federation (the overt antagonists of the film) seemed not only weak but simply too silly-looking to make effective villains.  (The droidekas fared better in this regard; maybe a droid army composed of bipedal versions of these machines would have made a more convincing threat.)         Nonetheless, Ep.I DID have some good points, with flashes of that old \\"Star Wars magic\\", as it were.  There were some good set pieces, like the stately palaces on Naboo and the mythic grandeur of Coruscant, especially the Jedi Temple and Galactic Senate chambers.  Early on, the approach to the underwater city of the Gungans managed to evoke a sense of wonder similar to the Emerald City in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"; the attacks of the giant underwater monsters were impressive, also.          As for the heroes, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn was one of the film's saving graces.  I found him to be the most likeable character in the movie, and I truly felt for him at the end.  Ewan McGregor did a decent job as Obi-Wan, though he had little to do.  Pernilla August was also convincing in her small role as Anakin's mother.  As for the much-maligned Jake Lloyd, I could take him or leave him, though he did have a couple of good moments.  The scenes where Anakin parted with his mother on Tatooine, and where he was sitting alone in the spaceship with Padme, talking about how cold and lonely he was, were rather well done, capturing the mood of young Anakin as he was thrust into his strange new life.         As the villains, Darth Maul and Darth Sidious were an effectively menacing duo that drove most of the events of the movie through their actions.  The final battle between Maul and the Jedi Knights was a definite highlight.  Another for me was Darth Sidious, who provided a link to the old SW mythos as a grim foreshadowing of things to come.  Whenever the sinister figure of Sidious appeared on screen to deliver his orders for his evil plans via holographic transmission to the intimidated Trade Federation leaders, the sense of tension was palpable.         After all is said and done, while I can't bring myself to truly dislike any SW film, and can appreciate the good points of this movie and what Lucas was trying to do here, it still could have been so much more.  It's not a terrible film, as some say -- just a muddled, mediocre one that feels like a lost opportunity.  With a more carefully constructed plot that stood better on its own, and which engaged the audience and made them care more about the outcome, it could have been far better.  As it is, Ep.I will probably be remembered as the \\"red-headed stepchild\\" of the Star Wars saga, being only for series completists who will fast forward to the good parts.  Fortunately, although this film started the prequel trilogy off on a sour note for many people, Lucas was able to learn from most of his mistakes, and the next two installments would be HUGE improvements over this one.
031606792X|5.0|The biggest problem with this book was that Eclipse was an amazing story that had a cliffhanger...so of course everyone created our own scenarios-you haven't guessed the storyline.  Everyone who dislikes it forgets that Stephenie Meyer is telling an amazing story.  She's not telling what she feels fans want to hear.  This story has been in her head from the beginning and I am so amazed by how it ends up happening.  Clear your mind of everything you thought might or might not happening...and enjoy the ride!
031606792X|4.0|Stephanie Meyer's Breaking Dawn is obviously not at all what most people expected. Apparently it is filled with ideas that many fanfic authors had. Apparently it has the ability to incite anger and emotion in people over the morals involved, and it's impact on society. It is actually the negative reviews that have solidified my belief that this book is a masterpiece.    I'm not a huge Twilight fan. I love the series, but I am not fanatic about it, though I will recommend it to people I think would enjoy it. I am a fan, but not unreasonably so. So with no more gilding the lily, and with no more ado, this is what I thought of Breaking Dawn.    Breaking Dawn's title, just it's title, is enough to really explain the book. It breaks the night, it breaks the unknown, but more than anything, it breaks the mold of the previous three books. It is a deviation and a huge task that Stephanie undertook. She had a lot of ground to cover. She had to transform Bella from an unmarried human, eighteen year old young woman, to a married vampire mother. And she had to drag along all her characters to make it fit (and work).    Also from the title, the \\"Dawn\\" part, you pretty much could already guess how it would end. \\"The night's darkest right before the dawn.\\"    The book is very adult themed. I'm still trying to figure out how these books were relegated into Young Adult. Even Little, Brown doesn't deal with Young Adult books very often. Stephanie said that when she wrote this book, she wrote it from her 29 year old perspective. And wrote it for women who remembered what it was like to be 17. The fact that children, young adults, and adults all love her story and books is just happenstance. Stephanie also was only originally contracted for the first three books, for $750,000. Breaking Dawn was sold for $400,000. Obviously the publisher wanted the material, as they knew it would sell. It is a business for all those accusing her of cashing in on her readers.    But as for the book, yesit has adult themes. Sex, violence, blood, pregnancy. And I for one, believe that is what really made the book. It went beyond telling a cute love story. It forced morality questions. Is it appropriate for an eighteen year old married young woman to have sex with her husband and accidently produce a child? Is the fact that she had yet to have sex with Edward before marriage, and that to their knowledge they could no have children possibly be a way of letting younger children know \\"Yes it CAN happen to you.\\" and then adding \\"And if it does, I hope you fight for it?\\" And more importantly, if Edward had known what could have been produced, would he have consented before she was changed?    People have suggested that Edward's reaction of getting rid of \\"it\\" was supporting abortion. Let us remind ourselves, Bella wouldn't let that happen, and once Edward saw the love and felt the mind of the child, Jacob was the one who felt betrayed. What I took away from the whole sex and abortion thing was that Stephanie was saying, \\"Yes it can happen to you.\\" \\"It's worth keeping.\\" and most of all, \\"Fighting for your children rewards you in ways you never knew existed.\\"    The mere suggestion that this book is glorifying teen pregnancy and abortion is plain ignorance. Stephanie was raised Mormon. I doubt she is able to completely separate herself from that. And actually, in the Mormon culture, its not uncommon to be married at eighteen. Current societal trends have led people to believe eighteen is an inappropriate age to bear children. It's not. Especially with a family close by including a doctor, some of the best protection available, and a very concrete way of providing for the child. Not to mention it was an accident and almost killed her in the process.    The book is a masterpiece because it plays on a lot of human emotions. Terror, suspense, anger, frustration, happiness, joy, fear, and humor. The actions her characters take may or may not align with what you personally wantedas a reader, but the fact that the book was as well conceived and delivered as it was, makes me believe in the book. It must have been a masterpiece to be so well written than it can provide such a range of reactions.     The book is fantastic. It may not have been what I was hoping for or wanted, but it was a wonderful book. Well worth reading, and well worth thinking about.    4/5 (Just because in my opinion, she destroyed Jacob.)
031606792X|3.0|The whole Twilight series isn't one that I've ever taken that seriously. I enjoy the fluffy, angsty, romantic series for what it is: a literary cupcake with sparkly sprinkles. But the problem (for me) is that a majority of the first half of this book is nothing like that.     It gets heavy, and in a really, really disturbing way. I don't mean the book suddenly gets serious (although it does), because getting serious isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's the fact that Meyer decided to write what she did...to write something physically agonizing for a character and disgusting/uncomfortable the the reader for no apparent reason. Was it so that Bella would be near-death, forcing Edward to turn her? Just another example of characters lacking choices, which is a really unsettling theme in the whole saga. I also can't condone the behavior of a lot of the other characters. I'm not okay with a character willing to sacrifice another for selfish reasons. I'm not okay with other characters being okay with that. I'm not okay with a character wasting away while others \\"ooh\\" and \\"awe\\" at the cause of it. Also, the lack of continuity in the series (vampires can't make blood rush to their cheeks to blush, but if they're male, there's no problem making it rush to other regions. And, even though vampires can't cry and don't need to use the bathroom, they totally still have sperm) is ridiculous. I can accept that they sparkle. I can accept they have skin as hard as marble. But don't ask me accept that. What does Meyer take her readers for?    The good news is...after the first half is over, the book finally starts reading like the previous three. There's no more super heavy/disturbing/repulsive/all-together-really-freaking-weird behavior going on. Well, barring a really unsavory case of imprinting, but there is some good vampire vs. vampire drama in which the reader gets introduced to a lot of other really interesting characters. Why the whole book didn't cover this part of the plot, I don't understand. I was really engrossed in the last half, probably because I wasn't horrifed like I was during the first.     I guess it comes down to, if you can stomach the first part, you'll find yourself rewarded with the second. For the most part.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I bought this as a birthday gift (which was a great hit), and ended up having to find another for myself.  If you like Brad Paisley, this one is a must for your collection.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Most Floyd fans (but not this one) agree that the group did their best work from 1973 to 1979.  What to make of the later albums under the Pink Floyd name is a lot more difficult.  To some, Roger Waters was the heart and soul of the band; the Final Cut is a masterpiece, or close to it, and the less said about what came afterward the better.  To others, the Final Cut was a hideous misstep and the following work was an appropriate return to the \\"true Floyd style.\\"    I don't really have a dog in that argument - I prefer my Floyd of the late 60s, early 70s vintage.  Without getting into whether a \\"true Floyd style\\" really exists, this is a nice album that doesn't sound much like their previous work.  Despite some stylistic similarities; a lot of the cheesy, late 70s glitz and bombast of The Wall is stripped away.  What's left is largely a Waters solo album.  The contributions by Nick Mason are negligible; Dave Gilmour offers some classic guitar solos (\\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" are among his best) and a vocal on the awful \\"Not Now John\\".  And though the arrangements are very nice (including some wild loud-soft dynamics - be careful with that volume knob), with the exception of an occasional saxophone or guitar solo there are few significant instrumental interludes.    As far as Waters - he manages to avoid the over-the-top, high-concept pretentions of The Wall and The Pros & Cons of Hitch-hiking.  There's lots of truly moving music here - \\"The Hero's Return\\", \\"The Gunner's Dream\\", \\"Paranoid Eyes\\", \\"Southampton Dock\\", \\"The Final Cut\\".  \\"Two Suns of the Sunset\\" has some of the best lyrics he wrote under the Floyd moniker, mostly free of the excessive bitterness that often crept into his work.    If you go into this album without expecting it to be Dark Side or Wish You Were Here part 2, there's a pretty good chance you will appreciate it.
0743290119|1.0|I had high hopes for this novel and was thoroughly dissapointed. Like other reviewers mentioned, the characters are incredibly one-dimensional, over the top sterotyped, boring, and just all blend together. There is no feeling of any connection to any of them.    The storyline jumps around and there seems to be no climax, or if there was one, it was weak. I think this book is trying to cash in on the \\"sex and the city\\" formula but none of them are endearing or interesting.     The end was irritatingly contrived and too neatly put together, to the point that the reader feels pretty annoyed at how \\"perfectly\\" everything turned out, beyond reason.     This was just not the kind of book you would expect from the same author of the devil wears prada.
B0000026NC|2.0|Until they hit it big with Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd were very much a live band; \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\", \\"Careful with That Axe Eugene\\", \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" each got a dry run in the studio, but it was on stage that the magic really happened.  When the band became extremely popular, Floyd shows became increasingly scripted.  By the time the group recorded this album, in the late 80s, little of the energy and excitement of the group's early days was left.  This album may be \\"live\\" but it doesn't sound like it.    The Momentary Lapse stuff sounds decent; \\"On the Turning Away\\" improves on the original version, and \\"Dogs of War\\" sounds much better than the awful studio version.  It's the more popular 70s music that kills this recording.  The band's failure to credibly pull off this material is often blamed on Roger Waters's absence, but I don't buy that; it's just a general lethargy and going by the numbers which makes \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Us and Them\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" sound lackluster.  The beginning of \\"Another Brick\\" is offensively bad, a groan-worthy moment.  Only \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and a smoking version of \\"One of These Days\\" stand out.    Overall, this is one of the weakest things to be released under the Pink Floyd name.  At least the studio disc from Ummagumma had a soul.  If you want a document of the later Floyd in action, check out Pulse; but better yet, watch Live at Pompeii or try to get your hands on an \\"unofficial\\" recording from the early 70s, when the band was at its live peak.
031606792X|4.0|I can't believe how upset all of you are over Breaking Dawn. It was FANTASTIC!!!  We got what we wanted, didn't we? Edward and Bella are together, forever! I thought Stephanie took the series to the next level.  She was very creative in coming up with new plot lines (baby, imprinting etc.) It all felt like the natural evolution of the whole series. It all fit for me.  The characters matured. The store line matured. I don't think the baby thing was a cop out. It is a consequence of having sex.  Wake up girls - when you have sex you can get pregnate.  At least she was married, right? Yes, the whole baby thing came out of left field, but I kind of liked it. When you have a baby inside you, a natural maternal instinct kicks in. You become protective. Before the pregnancy, Bella was young, immature, whiney and desperate. Once she knew she was pregnate, the grew up, stopped whining and became the woman she was meant to be.  I applaud her for going through with the pregancy, even at great personal sacrifice.  I too, hoped that Edward would turn her once she gave birth. I loved the fact this was the way she became a vampire - on her death bed, like all of the other Cullens. I loved the fact that Bella finally began to believe in herself, developing self-confidence, thinking of herself as beautiful - she was coming into her own. It was like she was meant to be a vampire her whole life. She was meant to meet and fall in love with Edward. She was meant to have a child who was unique - one of a kind. And, she most definately was meant to be the one to save the vampires from the Volturi. She developed her special sheild gift to protect those she loved. This all seemed like the natural evolution to the plot. She grew up.  This was not an awful book.  You can tell SM took a lot of time to plan out the plot line, create new twists and take us places we NEVER thought the characters could go.  I'd like to say thank you to SM for making Breaking Dawn a little different from the rest.I am so thankful for the happy ending and the way Bella let Edward see her thoughts, even for a moment.  It was the closure I had been longing for and just what the series needed.  Grow up people!
B000002C1W|3.0|Much as The Final Cut was largely a Roger Waters solo album with other members contributing as session members, the same can be said for Momentary Lapse and David Gilmour.  Momentary Lapse does sound more like a 70s Floyd album than The Final Cut did, but this is at least partly because Gilmour and Bob Ezrin tried really hard to make it sound that way.  Waters referred to it as a \\"pretty fair forgery\\" and that is not a bad description.    That said, Waters's description includes \\"fair\\" as well as \\"forgery\\".  This is an enjoyable album and, aside from the abysmal \\"The Dogs of War\\", doesn't include any real duds.  Historical revisionism has tended to exaggerate Waters's importance in the band's music; through 1975, he was just one of four key contributors.  The two instrumentals are very good, and \\"Sorrow\\" comes pretty close to classic status.  Some might be disappointed that the album isn't all doom and gloom (\\"On the Turning Away\\", \\"One Slip\\"), but before 1973 Pink Floyd covered a much wider range of emotional ground.    I wouldn't recommend getting this until you have most of Floyd's other work.  It's a poor substitute for Dark Side or Wish You Were Here.  The Division Bell, made by the same crew 7 years later, is a superior effort.  But if you have those albums and really want something that sounds like 70s Pink Floyd under the Pink Floyd name, this album probably won't disappoint.
031606792X|5.0|And no I'm not going all fangirly & worship everything SM writes, but I think everyone is just hating it because it isn't how they wanted their precious story to end. Everything was completely different and unexpected. If it wasn't, then the book would have been boring. I liked the twists and turns. I just hope that after all this [...] that Steph just won't up and quit. I am looking forward to reading anything else she has up her sleeve.     The Host is still my favorite though. Can't wait for the sequal for that!

1595141715|4.0|Clay Jensen opens a package to discover several cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, a classmate that committed suicide two weeks earlier. The thirteen sides of the tapes describe the snowball effect of rumors and high school life that lead Hannah to kill herself--and one of the sides is addressed to Clay. The interweaving narratives of Hannah's recording and Clay's listening sometimes flows into a confusing muddle, but Thirteen Reasons Why has an ingenious premise which intrigues the reader--and even better, it contains perceptive, intelligent content. This is a captivating and surprisingly sensitive book, and I recommend it.<br /><br />Asher writes a good book: the premise is ingenious, the characters are realistic, and the narrative is compelling and skillful (if sometimes confusing). Clay doesn't know why Hannah killed herself or why she cites him as one of the causes of her death, so the book's very premise captures the reader and holds him in suspense until the end. (When they finally came, I found the answers to these questions a bit anticlimactic--but I still appreciate the journey to reach them.) Hannah and Clay, as well as the other teenagers that populate the book, are wonderfully realistic--sometimes this traps them in annoying teen behaviors, but it also makes them compelling and sympathetic. Asher interweaves Hannah's tapes with Clay's listening--it can be easy to miss the switch, and going back to reread a few paragraphs breaks up the flow of the book, but on the whole this is a wonderful narrative choice which keeps suspense high and explores the two characters and their relationship in great depth.<br /><br />Asher writes well, but perhaps even better than his writing is his content. Difficult subjects are old fair in young adult novels, but it is rare to see them handled so well as they are here. Asher does not include taboo subject on a whim or for shock value alone; rather, he is aware of their impact and treats them with respect. Rumors about promiscuity begin the snowball effect that leads to Hannah's suicide, and it is at once refreshing and terrifying to see the impact of sexual activity, social norms, and high school politics on these teens. But Hannah's thirteen reasons do not excuse her from responsibility for her death, and the impact of her suicide lingers in Clay and in the community. The book's message is that actions have consequences--and we all have some control over those consequences. It's a hopeful message but it's terrifying too, and Asher delivers it with aplomb.<br /><br />For whatever reason, Thirteen Reasons Why didn't blow me away, but I greatly enjoyed it nonetheless. Perhaps the teen voice was too accurate; certainly the constant switches in narration slowed down my reading. I also believe that the secrets--Hannah's final reasons and her connection to Clay--quite live up to all the suspense that proceeds them; I'd like to see more of an adult influence on the characters, and the ending is abrupt. But these quibbles are just that: though imperfections, they don't detract from the book as whole. This is a wonderful debut novel: strongly written, captivating, and intelligent, with unusually perceptive content. It captured and impressed me, and I'm glad to have read it. I highly recommend it--to readers of all ages, although I think it will mean most to high schoolers.gin the snowball effect that leads to Hannah's suicide, and it is at once refreshing and terrifying to see the impact of sexual activity, social norms, and high school politics on these teens.

031606792X|5.0|I finished the first three books feeling very concerned for Bella (who is sometimes annoying, but I love her anyway). I found Stephenie Meyer's conclusion to be lovingly loyal to Bella with benefits to others in the process. Many feel this book was a cop-out, but I am grateful for the opportunity to have had an indulgent glimpse into Bella's new journey and endeavors. Now I feel like she's in good hands and I can leave her and her extended friends and family. The Cullens are supposed to go on forever, but this series is not. I'm happy and satisfied with this stopping point. Thanks for delivering the goods, Stephenie.
031606792X|3.0|ok, i agree with almost everyone of you! this book is sooo different then everyone expected. its still a good book, but way different. :( i believe we dont really love it because in soooo many we can not relate to bella, nor edward anymore. and like 300 pages (SPOILERS BELOW) were nothign but bella pregnancy. so i got kinda bored. i am disapointed. it seems like stpehenie did not write this book herslef, kinda of like she got someone else to write it. come on stephnie you could have dont better. but she is human. and i mean it is a good book. just weird, and different...
031606792X|4.0|Poorly written and edited aside, I really didn't mind the plot at all. For one, I didn't mind that Bella was happy about being pregnant. They were all so sure it couldn't happen. I hated the name Renesme the entire time I was reading chapter 1-14 leak, but after it being drummed into my head for half the book, I will possibly name a cat that. Jacob imprinting was not that weird, and who cares if he had kissed her mom or not. That totally doesn't relate to the relationship between Jacob/Nessie. Which brings me to my next point, the whole Nessie thing. I enjoyed that Bella was so very disturbed, and very adamant about censoring its use. What can I say, its fiction! Deal with it. It wasn't horrible. Fans have just had too long to stew over the possible outcomes, and it didn't coincide at all with what people were hoping for. Personally, I think it was possibly a good thing that SMeyer popped out some bizzaro on us. I mean seriously, love it or hate it, who saw that coming???? Still, I would sack my editor...
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three books.. Stephenie meyers caught my attention when I randomly picked up twilight. At first I thought i wasnt going to like it but I fell in love with the characters!! So over the next two weeks i read new moon and eclipse and loved them all. I was very excited that the last book was coming out soon, so over the next few months of waiting for this book, I reread the first three to make sure I didnt miss a thing. I was very excited to see a good ending since I loved the authors work in the host.    I got the book and read it... and i was very dissapointed. I thought this book was written horribly.. it was good for the first few chapters but then it just went all over the place. The writing style was waaayy off! I thought this twilight saga was suppose to be in bella's point of view and not a mix between her n jacob. It threw the story all over the place for me and the plot was all over the place, there was no secure story line and it went all over the place.    I have to say that I was in love with the first three books, and I am going to qoute a fellow reviewer and say \\"that the series ended at eclipse for me\\". The story left me empty and not fulfiled at all -- i do not feel any closure with the characters and i am left very disappionted with stephenie meyers.    I really hope stephenie meyers reads the reviews and sees where she went wrong. She should have spent more time on this story instead of trying to shoot it out asap. I also really hope that she will see the holes and problems with the story and rewrites the whole book.    overall this book was a real let down -- it left me upset and depressed. I do not feel any closure
031606792X|5.0|Ok it was very very good.  Read it again.  It was crazy and not something I would have expected.  Isn't that something you should want in a book.
031606792X|1.0|I am so completely disappointed in this book. My four friends and I woke up the next day hoping the book was a sick dream. I honestly don't see what happened, this could have been the best book of the series but it was the worst. All of the characters were completely out of character, Bella's pregnancy made absolutely no sense, and Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee-whatever-her-name-is is incredibly disappointing.    I think the real question is: What happened to Stephenie's beloved series?
057506885X|5.0|An excellent Discworld side-story with many favorite characters (including, of course, the ever-present anthropomorphic personification of Death), and superb artwork.  Don't miss it.
031606792X|5.0|Okay, honestly i don't know what everyone is so disappointed about. Seriously, personally, to me, I thought this book was phenomenal, in a good way.    Spoiler alert:    Okay, everyone is going on about how Stephenie is giving out a really bad message, or reality isn't anything like this.    Reality check this : THIS IS A FANTASY BOOK. for pete's sake. THIS IS NOT REALITY. I know, I want it to be too, but GET OVER IT.     Also, didn't Stephenie say that the was a sucker for happy endings? Well, so am I. Jeez. This is a YOUNG ADULT book too. And there WERE problems. There was the whole angsty coming of age for jacob. And what's wrong with Jacob finding his imprint? That doesn't mean this is La la land. Notice he got his imprint AFTER he went through a HECK of a lot of pain (If you didn't get that, read book 2:jacob again, instead of skipping it)    Edward got his fair share of angst too. He had to go through, first the pain of hurting Bella that first time, then watch her take the pain of her pregnancy that was all his fault. what part of \\"That [Edward's face] was the face of a man burning at the stake\\" did you not get?    Even Bella got angsty too, first she had to deal with the newborne control, and although she's good at it, it doesn't mean it's easy! And besides, were you that surprised that she exceled at mental control? What with being prepared before hand and her before disgust with blood. It makes sense. Jeez, give her a break. And remember she DID go through a vampyric pregnancy.    And ALL of them dealt with the pressure and fear with the entire volturi coming after them.     And you all want it to be MORE angsty? News check: Any more angsty and this book would be down right depressing.     And, for crying out loud, stephenie IS a mother! And she DOES think bella as a daughter! Is it so wrong for a mother to want her daughter to feel the joys of motherhood too? And personally, I LOVE NESSIE. Jeez. Again, cut some slack.     ~As for people who haven't read it or don't know what to think of it yet, DON'T LISTEN TO THE CLOSE MINDED CRITICAL REVIEWS. Just enjoy the book, and for pete's sake, enjoy the HAPPILY EVER AFTER.~
031606792X|5.0|I loved the book, I seen it comeing when she was own her honeymoon getting pregnant, but suprised me that she had the baby so fast. It took me a while to see Jacob imprinting with Nessa that would be strange being in love with Bella and having fantsay's of her and then imprinting with her daughter,It grossed me out also I can aggree with a lot of the negative thoughts here but i still liked the book. The imprinting with a wolfe and a baby or child is more strange to me. Even though Bella is young and pregnant i can see her loving the baby because she is so in love with Edward but how fast things progesed should have really freak her out. I did fell sorry for Rosalie but this would also become her baby to love being in the family. Loved the book i have no problem with Edward and Bella and there happiness but Jacob was always my favorite.-
B0017MO10U|5.0|Yeah, I am a huge Stargate fan.  The franchise created by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright is the longest running sci-fi series in the US.  While longevity might not always indicate quality, Stargate lived 10 seasons on network TV because it presented long story arcs along with interesting characters and situations that you wanted to watch week after week.<br /><br />So, with that, this second movie produced after SG-1 was not renewed as a series on the Sci-Fi channel-- \\"Continuum\\" was definitely a treat. While the prior movie tied up lots of loose ends, Continuum is really a continuation of the franchise.  The use of an alternate time line provided an opportunity to give familiar characters different roles than they have played in the past.<br /><br />The story, without revealing any details is \\"simple\\".  Ba'al as a continuing bad guy has a fail safe to prevent his (un)predictable demise.  The Stargate time line is changed and the Stargate program is not developed as it had been on Earth.  It is up to SG-1 to set things right, stop the destruction of Earth and the Gou'ld take down of the galaxy.  For such a familiar story line you would think it would be getting OLD.  Guess not!<br /><br />Highlights?  Jack O'Neill makes an appearance.  Vala is wonderfully different in character, as is Teal'c -- both characters revealing a potential past.  The concept of time travel --especially getting to see how it is accomplished-- is always fun, along with the paradoxes time travel always seems to present. Oh, and as one of my friends always used to say to spoil things I had not seen yet.... \\"everyone dies\\".<br /><br />If you are a fan, Buy this movie.  You will enjoy it.  If you are not a fan, start with season 1 and work your way forward!  You only have 10 seasons of spectacular sci-fi to get through.<br /><br />I just hope that this is not the last thing we will be seeing of Stargate SG-1.  A tear forms in my eye thinking that might be the case....
031606792X|1.0|Let me first say that I was another excited fan girl waiting with trepidation at midnight to get my pre-ordered copy of Breaking Dawn. I avoided all spoilers because I wanted to experience the book the way Stephenie Meyer intended, without any idea of what was going to happen. I wish I did know so I could prevent wasting my time and money on Breaking Dawn, or as it should be more aptly titled, Breaking Down. This book had so much potential to wrap up the series in a satisfying and interesting way and instead, the more I read, the more I was horrified at the book that was masquerading as a part of my favorite series. This book completely sullied an otherwise enthralling (though at times shallow) series.    (Spoilers below, read at your own risk.)  I suppose I should start with the sheer idiocy that was Bella's pregnancy. I completely agree with the reviewer that said that even in a fantastical and supernatural world, the events still need to adhere to the canon and rules previously set up in the Twilight universe. That's what keeps things realistic and that's what makes a successful series-- think Harry Potter (perhaps Ms. Meyer needs to take a page from Rowling's book. Not literally, of course). The fact that that Breaking Dawn is THEMED around a concept that Meyer has previously stated impossible ruins whatever believability the series had. Twilight has now become an AU fanfiction, plain and simple. Meyer has said that vampires can't even produce their own saliva, let alone fertile sperm that apparently has the ability to conceive life. I'm still waiting for an explanation of this phenomenon that makes sense and follows the Twilight canon, because honestly, are we expected to believe that this happened because Edward and Bella are just so different? Please.    Everything that happened in the book was so convenient. That's not the mark of a good writer, that everything can be explained by some fantastic loophole so that everything can be tied up in a pretty box witha bow. I'm pretty sure the general consensus of fans is that they want something realistic, not mindlessly inane and perfect. It's pretty convenient that Bella is somehow able to completely skip the newborn vampire stage because she's unique. What, pray tell, Ms. Meyer, is so different and special about Bella that she is the only person in thousands of years to be able to do this? Because frankly, all I've seen of Bella is a whiny, dependent, immature girl that is unable to think or live for herself. And how convenient that Jacob gets his own \\"happy ending\\" by imprinting on Nessie (yes, Nessie), the daughter of the girl that he's in love with. Because, discarding the pure yuck factor of that situation, if he can't have Bella, he might as well have the next best thing! And again, sheer convenience that Nessie grows at twice the normal rate, so that Jacob doesn't have to suffer with being a pedo for too long!    The morals Ms. Meyer presents us with in this novel are astounding. She's conveying that it's okay to get married (I'll give her that one) and have children at 18 because, hey, it's for love. And don't worry if you're too selfish or irresponsible to actually have another being be dependent on you, because everything will just work out fine! Forget discovering your own independence, forget college, forget your family and friends, it's worth it to be a teenage mother to a demon half-child. Thanks for the message, Smeyer!! I've discarded the sexist undertones of the series before this, because I was really hoping Bella would gain some sort of independence and original thought in this book. I was waiting for her to grow up. Don't expect it to happen. Bella's existence still revolves around a man and the story opens with Bella despairing, still, that she's not pretty enough, smart enough, anything enough, for the perfection that is Edward. We GET it, Stephenie, she's insecure! Can you actually develop her personality a little now?    Bottom line, this book is justtrash. The writing is sloppy (how many times do we have to hear Edward described as \\"perfect\\", \\"smooth as marble\\", and \\"icy to the touch\\" or read cheesy prose like, \\"Our gazes locked for a moment; his golden eyes were so deep that I imagined I could see all the way into his soul. He had the most beautiful soul, more beautiful than his brilliant mind or his incomparable face or his glorious body\\"), the characters aren't quite right, and the entire series does a total 180.    This series has gone downhill since New Moon, but please, if you value your sanity, end it with Eclipse. I want to ask Stephenie Meyer what she was thinking, but moreso, I want to know how this mindless garble made it past the editor's desk.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Shoot 'em Up is EXACTLY what the title says- nothing but one unrealistic shooting segment after another.  I think some people need to realize what makes these kind of movies so addicting and fascinating:    - Most importantly, it's nothing BUT shooting, shooting, and more shooting.  It's supposed to be a shooter, and delivers huge.    - Many people tend to ignore how much creativity is involved making each scene loaded with tons of interesting ways to shoot the bad guys.  Seriously, watch carefully every single shooting segment in this movie, and try telling me it's not the most creative and interesting way to make a shooter.      Come on, the main character is practically bouncing off walls killing bad guys left, right up and down.  This kind of stuff rules, and it probably takes a lot of time for the writers to find new ways to make shooting someone look different from the shooting scenes in other movies.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband was thrilled with the gift of John Adams DVD set.  I watched it with him and we both learned a lot about that time period that we didn't know.  Terrific portrayal of history.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|This isn't the most captivating movie in the world, but it does have humor in it with a serious underlying message. It's a good movie to watch when you're tired, but not so good for real brain stimulation.
031606792X|1.0|I am in shock. Complete shock.  What did I just read? Surely that was not the ending my beloved series! But it WAS!  I counted down to the book. I held the book in my hands with butterflies in my stomach.   Everything about that book was wrong. The writing style, the characters, the name Renesmee. Ugh! I felt no connection to the baby. I felt no swooning for Edward, no relatability to Bella.   Somewhere, someone is laughing hysterically that I PAID MONEY to read that.   EPIC FAILURE.
031606792X|1.0|Minor spoilers...    I loved Twilight and thought Eclipse and New Moon were OK. I was desperately hoping Breaking Dawn would reflect back to the Twilight days and pull it all together in a good way. Not so.     Really, where is the editor? Page after page of eye rolling, grimacing, grinding teeth, gritting teeth--I'm surprised the characters don't all have TMJ. It's been the same through all the books but by the fourth...please get a thesaurus and find another way to show character emotion.      Also, could you cut out the whole Jacob's side of the story? BORING. Page after page of werewolf pack dialogue that did little to advance the story. I would have rather had Edward's view.    Overall, very disappointed with the direction the characters took and found the plot rambling and stupid--by the end I was bored with the whole thing. In the few moments I wasn't bored by the storyline, I was revolted. Truly, by the time I finished the book I didn't even care what happened to Edward and Bella and their demon spawn.     Save yourself the pain of reading this awful book and go reread Twilight. I wish I had.
031606792X|1.0|So tedious and nonsensical it was like reading the bible, if the bible were written by a 10 year old girl who thought jesus was hot stuff. Also there's not enough death.
031606792X|4.0|It has been difficult to read such negative reviews of Breaking Dawn because they are almost all being written by Twilight fans.  Fans who had expectations coming into this final installment.  Fans who had their own ideas about what would be best for Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  Fans with biases.  And some fans who were looking for something more than just a story.      I would like to begin by pointing out that the only person Stephenie Meyer needed to please was herself.    This series has always been about telling a story, her story.  Stephenie Meyer wasn't writing social commentary.  She wasn't writing myths to explain her personal view of a culture, society, or ethical code.  Rather, she was telling the story of a small group of people, vampires, and \\"shape-shifters.\\"  That's it.  Her only responsibility in writing this last book was to stay true to herself as a writer and true to her characters, which I believe she did.  She tied-up practically every plot line that she introduced.  Were there some minor gaps?  Yes (i.e. what did Bella end-up telling Reneé and Phil, did the two Quileute packs come back together, [and if so] who ended-up being the Alpha, did Leah finally imprint with someone, et cetera).  But none of those subplots was essential to the story, merely information that readers wanted to know (and information that I'm sure Stephenie Meyer will be all too happy to provide readers through the fan questions she will be answering on her tour, as well as on Twilight Lexicon and stepheniemeyer.com).     I would like to continue to address the fact that many are forgetting that these are Stephenie Meyer's characters.  Though readers may be emotionally invested in what happens to them and think that they know them intimately, she knows them better than any reader does because she made them.  Not only that, but these characters of hers also live in a world that is of her construct.  They do not live in the \\"real world, or the world that anyone else wants themto live in.  These particular characters and this particular world are entirely Meyer's.  As a reader, I know that it is easy to forget that.  Though this is not the ending I myself would have written for the series, I don't believe that anyone else could have written a better ending to this saga.  They would have been writing about characters and about a place that they did not truly know, that they had only seen glimpses of.  So many reviewers have been critical of the plot, and what I would like to ask them is to please, sit down in front of their own computers, typewriters, or notebooks and write something better, something that fits into the rules and constructs that Stephenie Meyer provided up until the end of Ecplipse, something that honestly stays true to the characters, and something that closes everything up as neatly (or even more neatly) than Meyer's Breaking Dawn.  I don't think that anyone else could.      Also, so many reviewers of the book have given it 1, or in some cases 0, stars and then written scathing reviews about how Stephenie Meyer has \\"sent messages encouraging/supporting racism, misogyny, teen pregnancy, turning one's back on higher education, rewards without sacrifice\\", et cetera.  For those reviewers, especially the adults, who believe these books are sending moral or ethical messages to the \\"youth of today,\\" I have to question whether or not they actually understand what these books are about.  These books are about story-telling.  Stephenie wrote these books as she got to know her characters.  I don't think that she has any social, political, religious, or other type of agenda.  She is basically relaying the stories of individuals whom she knows.  I am tempted to address each of the proposed issues individually, but this review is plenty long as is.    Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was enthralling, it was darker than I ever though she would go, she was faithful to the relationship between Bella and Edward, and I actually thought that her prose in this book was second only to Twilight.  I was glad that she didn't continue to harp on Bella's choice between Edward and Jacob.  She recognized the finality of Bella's decision at the end of Eclipse.  Breaking Dawn was a departure from the other three because those books focused more on choices being made, and this book was what happened after Bella made her choice.  It would naturally be different (in fact, it almost read like a 750 page epilogue).      I would encourage any fans of the Twilight series to read this last book, and read it with an open mind, free of expectations, allegiances, and biases.  And I also hope that readers will try to remember that this book is merely a story, a work of fiction.
031606792X|1.0|I enjoyed the first three Twilight books, borrowing them from friends, reading each in a single draught and quickly declaring them \\"guilty pleasures.\\" I thought the series' unlikely charm had won me over and I purchased the fourth book for myself.     The series is very shallow and in the Twilight universe, things seem to always work out. Though the characters endure hardships they always prevail and every challenge seems insignificant in comparison to the utter perfection of day to day life. This trend continues in the final book, intensified for good measure. These books are intrinsically unrealistic and it has never really bothered me, more insight and a better author would be required for an accurate depiction of real life. I found the more grusome plot points in this volume a little clunky and awkward as though the structure of the novel could not support them but less than troubling. What I find most bothersome about Twilight is the portrayal of the female main character.     I spent the entire first book waiting for Bella Swan to be more. I needed her to be stronger, more interesting and more self-sufficient. If I was going to accept her I needed her to be more inspiring. Inspiring she is not. She is weak and snivelling left perpetually as the most pathetic of teenage girls. As the series progresses, Bella acquires more protectors and more foolish mistakes. The second book made me very angry. To me, it is in no way okay for even a fictional character to become so attached to her boyfriend that her life ends when he leaves. Edward left Bella and she immediately was unable to function left a suicidal, broken-hearted mess for the months to come. I wonder if I was meant to feel her pain and to sympathise? I felt it was shameful and I was disappointed it came from the mind of a female writer. Young, impressionable minds have become very attached to this series and it worries me to think that they may now think such behaviour is acceptable. It upsets me to think that any woman would think its okay to sacrifice so much just to maintain needlessly intense devotion to a high school boyfriend.      Bella is the ultimate victim, falling dramatically into the arms of the nearest male. In the first three books the fact that she is constantly in mortal peril is explained lamely because she is clumsy. In the fourth book Bella becomes more physically capable but seemingly more immature with a series of ill-advised, old-fashioned decisions. There are other females in the book who do seem more capable and who are more interesting but they hardly compensate for Bella's inadequacy. Bella is meant to be the character that we relate to and the character that we truly understand. Ultimately, I find myself inspired to be nothing like Bella Swan.
031606792X|1.0|I have been such a Stephenie Meyer fan.  I have gone to book signings, stood in line for hours just to hear her speak for twenty minutes, and neglected my family for days to read her books.  Needless to say, Breaking Dawn is the biggest disapointment.    Where were the characters?  I felt like she was rushing this book, she had no plot development, character development.  Was Edward even is the book?  What about Jasper?  I can't remember!  I really wish I never would have read this.  I should have stopped at Eclipse, or in all reality, I should have stopped with Twilight.  I hope Stephenie Meyer knows that she really, really disapointed her true fans.  This book was terrible is all sense of the word.
031606792X|5.0|Oh my god... words cannot express the awesome-ness. I'm trying not to spoil anything but it was a great read I got it at midnight so I wouldnt learn anything too soon. I loved the beginning, the middle was hard for me because it was very emotionally charged Im so attached to the characters I always want everything to be perfect, the last half was wonderful it answered my...hopes about bella and edward. I hope this encourages readers of the others to continue.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|With Viva La Vida, Coldplay have finally realized the potential that A Rush of Blood to the Head promised and X&Y obscured in a haze of vapid soft rock. Chris Martin and Co. have always tried to be the next \\"important\\" rock band, and with a little push in the right direction courtesy of producer Brian Eno, they might have just hit the gold mine.<br /><br />The album starts out with an instrumental, \\"Life In Technicolor,\\" already a strange move for the usually verbose band. The song sounds curiously washed-out, but the guitars chime in all the right places and this minor opener, which almost seems like a throwaway at first glance, turns into something nearly epic. Martin's distinctive voice immediately comes in on following \\"Cemeteries of London,\\" and everything seems in order until roughly a minute in the drums erupt and the guitar ups the ante along with the distortion. And what do you know: it works.<br /><br />\\"Lost!\\" finds Martin in standard melancholic form, but the tribal beat underneath and squealing guitar halfway through announce that, finally, Coldplay has grown beyond the same old marching, piano-heavy mega-hits that \\"Speed of Sound\\" epitomized. Coldplay are trying out new things, and it has never sounded better.<br /><br />Martin seems to have grown up as well, reining in some of the more wailing tendencies of his voice and keeping it, for the most part, within a lower register than the falsetto that was previously beginning to grate. Ridiculously successful single \\"Vida La Vida\\" is a great example of the old merging with the new; at first glance, it is the most similar to previous Coldplay hits, anthemic and self-consciously majestic, but Martin sounds desperate and nostalgic, with lyrics that seemed to have come straight out of a medieval tale. The pulsating strings and orchestral timpani lend the track an appropriately grand flavor without mellowing into the bombastic balladry of old.<br /><br />\\"Violet Hill\\" is even better, making a case for best song on the record with a pounding drumbeat and a buzzing, angry guitar groaning to escape, but it's Martin's inspired, lovelorn vocals that make the track.<br /><br />From the arching Middle-Eastern strings on \\"Yes\\" to the gentle sitar-esque guitar line on \\"Strawberry String,\\" Coldplay have never sounded as adventurous as they do on Viva La Vida. If there's anything wrong with this record, it's the band's decision to squeeze disparate tracks together, like the My Bloody Valentine homage tagged onto the end of \\"Yes\\" that sounds nothing like anything before it. \\"Lovers in Japan - Reign of Love,\\" another two-parter, fails simply because neither section is strong enough to stand up on its own, the former lost in too many waves of sound and the latter a fairly mediocre piano torch song. Along with the completely unnecessary \\"hidden\\" track, \\"The Escapist,\\" which is essentially a retread of \\"Life In Technicolor\\" with vocals, it's one of only a few missteps on the album.<br /><br />From the triumphant, hand-clap-heavy climax of \\"42\\" to the jarring string work on \\"Yes\\" that stays with you long after the track is over, it's obvious that Coldplay have made something fresh and exciting. Viva La Vida is not perfect, and it's certainly not going to be the defining statement from the important rock band of the decade, but it makes a good case for maintaining Coldplay's relevance and proves that even Britain's most ordinary band can still throw a couple worthwhile curveballs.drumbeat and a buzzing, angry guitar groaning to escape, but it's Martin's inspired, lovelorn vocals that make the track.

031606792X|3.0|This isn't a one-star book. It could certainly have been better - the characters lacked depth compared to the other books, for instance - but save your one-star reviews for books that actually deserve them. Learn how to criticize a book objectively, rather than based on whether you like who got the girl.    For what it's worth, I didn't have a problem with Bella being pregnant, or with Jacob's imprinting. The pregnancy was a surprise that made things more interesting. I don't consider the imprinting to be \\"sick\\" like some others seem to. It is made clear in the series that it has little to do with sex while the target is still young, so what's the big deal? Grow up!    Is it really so unbelievable that it was fate - that Jacob loved Bella only as part of some grander design that would bring him his true soul mate? It's a fascinating idea.    I thought the \\"sex scenes\\" were the right level for this genre. So sorry that some of you wanted graphic porn in a book targeted to high school students. I mean, really?    I would have preferred more fighting at the climax of the story; it did seem that they got off too easily. At least a couple of important characters should have died. Like many have pointed out, that kind of sacrifice was what made Harry Potter 7 so powerful.    I would also like to have seen an epilogue, sometime in the future, telling us a little about Renesme as an adult and her relationship with Jacob.    One more thing: if you're going to write a review, keep your nasty personal comments about the author to yourself. This isn't the place. It is ironic that so many of the unkind reviews here have such poor grammar and confusing sentences... their authors hardly have the right to criticize someone else's writing skills!
031606792X|2.0|What the hell was SM thinking?  Did she even write this book?  I loved the first three parts of the series and prayed to the gods that this series would go out with a bang.  In actuality it went out more like a burp. A sour burp.  i felt the writing style was a bit off from the previous books and then having half the story told in Jake's POV was just dumb.  She made him sound like some dumb kid.  Okay, he is, but its painful to read that surfer-like dialog. It's like Dude, where's my motorcycle?  It felt really rushed and mish moshed, throwing everything together in a pot and seeing what comes out.  Not as bad as the last Harry Potter, but close.  it was unconvincing and well, utter crap.  The hybrid baby? kind of cute but the bond between her and Bella seems too rushed, Bella is too immature for parenthood. i missed Alice in this book. Charlie took it all way too well. Not enough Edward in this book, and when was there, I wanted to push him off a cliff.  And I wanted to smack the whole Cullen clan and the wolves. Everyone was way too whiny.  Also, how much crap and pain and grief can Bella hand to the Cullens?  She is always in a pickle and they always have to save her.  That was the running theme throughout the books: Pain, true love, sacrifice,and  honour; oh and saving Bella from EVERYTHING. It was ok at first then got really old by book 3.  She will always be a damsel in distress, even as a vampire.  Geesh.    I am usually more articulate than this but this book has broken me.      I worshiped SM before this, and now I will reread the other 3 and not pick this one up again to spoil everything she built up and then bulldozed.      I am giving it 2 stars as a tribute to the other books and what this SHOULD and COULD have been. I'll stick with Fan Fics thanks very much.

Did they not get the memo? WOMEN are the people who have babies.<br />So I boycotted it in theaters and then rented it becasue I was wanted to tear it apart.<br />Whoops! This movie blew me away! Great acting, very believable characters, cool cinematography and a nice mix of politics, love and dispair. Very good film, now one of my favorites!<br />Remember to check out the xtras and watch the special effects segment, way cool.
031606792X|1.0|While I have never been a fan of this series, I have read and somewhat enjoyed them all (if only for the terrible writing and the characters without personality), until Breaking Dawn.      My main problem with BD is that Bella does not sacrifice anything.  She gets everything she ever wanted and many things that she doesn't even know she wants until she gets them (like the baby).  She gets married without problems, she gets a completely weird vampire-human hybrid baby without problems (who makes Anne Rice's Claudia look normal), she even gets to be the best vampire ever (no worries about eating her friends and family, something that even Jasper still struggles with), and she gets to keep Jacob (he imprints on her daughter.  I was grossed out by Quil doing it and I'm grossed out that he's imprinting on Nessie as well).  In the end, she, Edward, and Nessie live in a cottage happy together.     Bella is Stephenie Meyer - it's proven if you look on her FAQ and Meyer's picture.  They physically resemble each other, making this series seem like the most popular self-insertion series ever.  Bella has no personality outside of her love for Edward, and neither does he.  The only characters that are interesting are Alice and Jacob.    I have seen many comparisons from this series to JK Rowling's Harry Potter, but the only similarity between these two is the amount of money they make.
031606792X|2.0|With the exception of a few chapters this entire book reads like a bad fanfiction.  Not only did Bella and Edward's child come out of no where, but she had next to no character development to make up for it.  Meyer was focused too much on making everything perfect for Bella and the result is disappointing. Breaking Dawn is by far her weakest work to date.
031606792X|2.0|Stephenie Meyer has lost her niche. The Twilight Saga has lost the magic it once held. Excluding Eclipse, maybe, after reading one of the other books for a second time; you start to see the little mistakes. Th sheen has warn off this new penny Stephenie Meyer has presented us with. This novel was not a novel. It was a straight cop out. A straight cop out that I bought at 12:30 A.M. I could've of read this trash on Fanfiction.net for free. I want a refund. No, as a dedicated twilight fan since I was 12, I deserve a refund.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Secondly what was she THINKING when she made Jacob IMPRINT on a child? A demonic child with an extremely white trash vampiric name mind you, but nonetheless a child. No matter how sick it seems, I suppose this was Meyer's way of saying: \\"Come on guys, see? It all works out in the end Bella and Edward are happily knocked up newlyweds and Bella's favorite werewolf is having a pedophile-like relationship with her kid.Alls well that ends well. Life can surprise you in very special ways, don't you think?\\" No. Not in this novel. I was surprised by how bad it was if that helps. But in a special way Stephenie. A very special way.<br /><br />Some other complaints I have include Bella as a vampire. In my opinion, as a human, she is probably  one of the most one dimensional characters in  English horror literature. As a vampire, she is even worse. Her conflicts and struggles don't come off as adding depth to her character. It makes her even more whiny than her usual human self. But this time around something made her a little easier to bear.Congratulations to the terrible plot.My special honor goes to you. The plot was as weak as Bella, but persistent. It just wouldn't stop coming back from the dead, reviving itself regardless of the pleas for it to just end it's life, and maybe that of the readers'.<br />I think the only thing that could've save this book,was if Renesmee, really turned out to be Edward Cullen Jr. as Bella had planned.It as if all Stephenie Meyer did was head over to Fanfiction.net and took a few ideas from some clueless 10 year old. If you're going to take horribly corny intimacy scenes and terrible dialogue, you might as well have taken that one. It would have added some comedy to this melodrama. Jacob imprinting on a little boy is comedy genius if you ask me.<br />Finally, my last complaint is Edward. What happened to everyone's vampire paramour with the body of granite? He turned into a wimp. In New Moon, when he decided kill himself after Bella jumped off a cliff, I thought he  couldn't get anymore pathetic, but I was wrong. Breaking Dawn clinched that. Quoting Jacob's new name for Edward, \\"The Burning Man\\" , is a spot on description of Edward's angsting. That's all he did for page upon page was angst. Sure he and Jacob became friends throughout he story, and the feeling of comradery was nice, but that didn't last. To sum it all up, this book was a failure.<br />When you see Breaking dawn on the shelves of your Barnes and Noble, run for the children's section and into the solace of a Harry Potter book.

031606792X|1.0|I love the twilight series and could not wait for this book to come out, the final part to the story.  All I can say is huge dissappointment.  I did not even want to finish reading, but continued reading because of how much I enjoyed the other books.  The plot line is horrible, and feels as if it was written by someone else lacking creativity.  After reading, felt like returning it.  All I can say is if you like the twilight series like I did (have read the first three books multiple times) do yourself a favor and do not read this.  It ruined the entire series for me.
031606792X|3.0|Do I hate it? No. Do I love it? No.<br /><br />Do I like it? Yes and no.<br /><br />I am still having mixed feeling about Breaking Dawn. Meyer did a good job with writing, but the story... I don't know how I can say it, because it was hard to tell how I like it. After I read three books a year ago, and I waited for Breaking Dawn for a year. I ran to the store, and got it. I was hella excited, because I refused to read the spoilers.<br /><br />After I finished reading Breaking Dawn at 5am in California, it left me shocked and confused.<br /><br />Some parts I really liked, and some parts I didn't like.<br /><br />*Warning Spolier!*<br />I just don't see many parts of Edward and Bella. Jacob's POV was okay, but I prefer all parts were only Bella's POV... Some characters made me feel they weren't the same.<br /><br />Some parts were just... blah. I just think all three series were much better. If some parts can move to Eclipse like the wedding, honeymoon (without a baby!), fights with other vampires, and bella change into a vampire, it would be much better than wasted over 600 pages in Breaking Dawn!<br /><br />I woke up in the morning the day after I read Breaking Dawn, I was in crappy mood.<br /><br />I believe Meyer tried to do her best to please us. I know she wanted us to be happy. I just know this book isn't working for me.<br /><br />Trust me, I will still love Twilight series forever, but not Breaking Dawn. I will go and watch Twilight movie for sure. I just don't want Breaking Dawn go into a movie, watching Robert rip the pillow apart with his mouth, and Kristen being pregnant! It would kill me for that.<br /><br />I have some questions for Meyer. If she answers my questions, and maybe I will feel better.<br /><br />Maybe I will read it again, and maybe I will grow out on it.<br /><br />Good luck for the people who haven't read it yet.
031606792X|2.0|I discovered The Twilight saga only weeks ago and devoured the first 3 books. I've since read each 3 times. I waited rather impatiently for Breaking Dawn. I just simply have to say that I am really disappointed in the book. I was hoping for some struggle on Bella's part to have to give up things in her human life. There was very little character development and some things that Bella did (like calling Rosalie for help) were just not in line with her usual behavior. Edward seemed almost nonexistent in the book. When he was in the book he was waging a war on guilt. Jake was redeemed and ended up happy, but it was all too neat. I was hoping for more than a neat little happily ever after delivered up with big bow. I also feel that the book sends a skewed message to the teen girl readers that life at 18 with a baby and marriage is going to be all happy in the cute cottage in the woods. I was just plain disappointed in the book.
031606792X|1.0|\\"Run while you still can,\\" I threatened.  \\"C'mon Bells! Nessie likes me, too,\\" he insisted.  I froze. My breathing stopped. Behind me I heard the lack of sound that was their anxious reaction.  \\"What...did you call her?\\"  Jacob took a step farther back, managing to look sheepish.  \\"Well,\\" he mumbled, \\"that name you came up with is kind of a mouthful and--\\"  \\"YOU NICKNAMED MY DAUGHTER AFTER THE LOCH NESS MONSTER?!\\" I screeched.    And then I lunged for his throat.    If you think this is good writing, you need help.
6305311463|5.0|Michael Bay's films are an odd addition to the Criterion collection, until you recall the Criterion Collection's mission statement reads \\"All we ask is that each film in the collection be an exemplary film of its kind.\\"<br /><br />Armageddon is ultimate distillation of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer's commercial action movie formula, a formula that they introduced in [[ASIN:B00004STUL Bad Boys (Special Edition)]], improved upon in [[ASIN:B000059TPN The Rock - Criterion Collection]]and finally, post-Armageddon, ran into the ground in Pearl Harbor.  Later Bay films like [[ASIN:B000BO0LH2 The Island]] and [[ASIN:B00005JPNO Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]are informed by this formula, but none of them come close to this masterpiece of 1990s action.<br /><br />As you almost certainly know, the plot of Armageddon involves a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with the Earth.  The only ones who can stop it are a rag-tag crew of oil drillers, who hitch a ride with some astronauts on a pair of fighter-jet space shuttles to blow the rock to bits with a well-placed nuke.  Sounds silly?  It is, and the film has a couple of winking acknowledgements of its own silliness.  Mostly though, the film believes in itself, and it is easy to become caught up in the (false) grandeur of the undertaking.<br /><br />Lots of people will bad-mouth this film, but those people are movie snobs.  Armageddon was one of the most popular movies of 1998, and it was a defining element of the popular culture of the time.  Ignoring it just because you dislike its style or story is to put on cultural blinders.<br /><br />Personally, I felt that Armageddon's most interesting cinematic characteristic is Bay's use of a kind of cinematic short-hand.  Much of Bruce Willis' character is defined by previous Bruce Willis movies, creating a kind of ready-made character who already feels familiar when he first appears.  Likewise, the sequences involving the military are largely understandable only because you know how the military acts in this sort of movie.<br /><br />But the best example of this shorthand is the character of Billy Bob Thorton.  At one point he mentions that he was formerly in the astronaut program, but dropped out.  There is a very short, perhaps less than 1 second, shot of a pair of leg braces.  With just this flash of visual information, Bay has established an entire history for the character.  Anyone who says that Bay is lacking in cinematic skills is ignoring his great gift at conveying information in a fast, visual way.  A great example of showing, not telling.<br /><br />This Criterion DVD has all the usual extra features you might expect, and they are as good as you might expect.  The DVD commentary is entertaining and informative, and Bay is quite open about his commercial and pragmatic sensibilities, such as the story he relates that a certain beauty shot of a car was included so that the car-maker would give him money to build a bizarre set that was not included in the budget.  Many of the cast members also contribute to the commentary; Ben Affleck is the highlight, obviously well trained from doing Kevin Smith commentary tracks.  Bruce Willis is as laconic as his reputation would suggest, but his few comments are sometimes hilarious.  This version of the movie is also slightly extended, with some scenes involving Willis' character's father, and a few slight extensions that add character beats to some of the minor scenes.  Nothing major.<br /><br />The second disc has lots of interesting features on the making of the movie, a collection of deleted scenes and a few bloopers.  Most of the deleted scenes are comedy bits with the actors riffing in character, and all of them are entertaining but it is easy to see why they were cut out.  The best blooper is an appearance by Michael Eisner (Disney's Touchstone division produced the film), who tells Willis that his casting isn't working out and the studio is replacing him with Kevin Costner.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic DVD of a highly entertaining movie. Don't let the movie snobs shame you into not getting it.  If you enjoyed this movie back in the late 90s, you'll find plenty to still enjoy here.  It has aged very well, and, from a film history standpoint, this DVD set is almost a time capsule of the bloated studio action pictures of the time.highly entertaining movie.

B000056BOR|1.0|I am sorry to say the quality of the DVD was poor.    We couldn't watch it as it stopped and started, or paused and started.    I am very disappointed.     Will You replace this DVD?
0060558121|2.0|Gaiman is a good, original writer, but this novel was a huge let down. Meandering,slow and fairly pointless as far as I'm concerned, with odd interludes that add nothing to the story. I suppose they are intended to add some kind of epic scope, but the main character is so frustratingly passive throughout that I had to really push myself to finish it, and then was sorry I'd wasted the effort.
031606792X|1.0|I was in love with the first three books and counted down until I could read the book, I hated the  book and at times had to put it down and just stop reading it because of my dislike for it. I was seriously excepting a lot more and am truly really really sad over the ending of this. Like many people have said it sounded more like a fan fiction book than one actually written by Stephanie Meyer. I just wish I could find the love for this book as I have for the other three. :'(. (Minor spoilers) I am so mad she had a baby I really didn't want that to happen and was agreeing with Jacob the whole time...until he imprinted. I really wish he hadn't he deserves someone better than that and I was mad that he forgave Bella. Hooray for the happy ending but things always aren't happy. The book was good until we found out Bella was pregnate for sure. Maybe later I will have a better review on it but for now I am soooo dissapointed and could cry.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was exactly what I hoped it would be!  I was happy, sad, nervous and everything in between.  It did NOT disappoint!  I loved that it was separated into 3 different \\"books\\". It had an unexpected twist in the \\"first book\\", that I didn't predict happening, the \\"second book\\" made me a bit nervous, but I was very happy for Jacob in the end! and the third book, well it was nail biting, made me cry in some parts and then ended with a big smile of great satisfaction!  I don't want to give anything away, but I can't believe people are rating this a 1, 2 or even 3 star book.  Their points, in my mind are ridiculous and if you are a true Twilight Fan, you have to be happy with the endings for all the characters that we have come to love in the series!
031606792X|1.0|Sorry, this book was BAD. I honestly can't see SM writing this. Please stop at Book 3
031606792X|5.0|I dont know why so many people think this book was horrible, I thought this book was amazing! Like a sticker said that i got from purchasing the book, \\"Breaking Dawn left me breathless\\". Everyone wins. Bella wins, Edward wins and even poor Jacob Black wins! I was so happy to see that Stephenie Meyer created a happy ending and gave all of us Twilight fans what we wanted (Bella and Edward forever!) Kudos Stephenie Meyers! You have recently won my vote on the best book series ever. It left me smiling and i thank you for not ruining such a beautiful story. Breaking Dawn is my favorite out of the rest of the Twilight Saga.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie Nicks is the greatest of all times and this album is a collection of some of her best work. I personally can listen to her album over and over again without being bored one moment. The album Crystal Visions is a must buy for any Stevie Nicks fan; you will not be disappointed. She is the best.
031606792X|5.0|I personally love a happy ending.  This is not a book about real people; there are no rules in a make believe world.  I feel that everything fits together as it should.  Why complain about people falling and staying in love and families remaining together and strong?  The book is different than I expected, better than I expected.  I was anticipating someone dead or at least brokenhearted at the end.  Upon reaching the end of the book, however, I just felt profound happiness.  SM clearly loves her characters and wants them to be happy, just as I do.  I loved it and i wouldn't have had it any other way.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I love firefly the series and I owned the DVD of Serenity, but this special edition rocks.
031606792X|1.0|Wow, just wow. Um, how can I put this politely so I don't insult anyone? I suppose I can't, so I won't bother try to. Breaking Dawn broke, alright. It tore whatever respect I had for Stephenie Meyer into millions of pieces. That being said, there WILL be some people who like this, I was just not one of them. If you have read the series so far and have enjoyed it, give it a try. Having doubts? Read on.<br /><br />So what did I personally have a problem with?<br />1) The cheap, fanfiction writing that a twelve-year old could write. It read like a made-up story on Fanfiction.net that barely stuck to canon. Stephenie Meyer just threw it all together as fast as she could, tried to make all of her characters happy for the sake of her fans, making it seem cheap and forced by occasionally breaking a couple of her own rules. Only once did I have to look up a word in a dictionary, and that was only because I forgot for a moment. Vocabulary = far too simple.<br /><br />2) Edward and Bella have sex. They are eighteen, don't use protection, but it's \\"okay\\" because they are married. (Complain all you want about this comment; I'm eighteen and I don't think it set a good example. Not for the eleven year olds reading this series.) Not to mention the ultimate birth control being Edward himself, which later proves false as well...  The story changed from a sweet, teenage romance, to a typical adult romance immediately. The plot lost all originality and now borrows aspects from the 1980s bodice-rippers. Bella \\"pleads\\" for sex (direct quote); she tries to seduce Edward with fancy underwear; when Edward agrees, he destroys pillows, takes chunks out of the headboard, not to mention finally getting her pregnant (something Stephenie swore couldn't happen with vampires) How is this story any different from any other romance novel? It was flat out laughable.<br /><br />3) This book gives off bad messages. Bella is NOT a good example of feminism. She never has been. But this book really forced me to draw a line. As long as you have your prince charming, everything will be alright. Satisfy your husband, make babies, stay home. Be dependent and subservient.<br /><br />4) Edward and Jacob's encounter. Disgusting. Edward asking Jacob to father a child with Bella? How could he do that to his own wife? And why on earth should it be Edward's duty to ask Jacob to do this?<br /><br />5) Jacob IMPRINTING on Nessie? What on earth is going on here? He just got done saying how he was imagining Bella pregnant with his own kid, and now he has to explain that to his future wife. It was so obvious that Stephenie Meyer just did this so Jacob would have a happy ending.<br /><br />6) Everything seemed too... convenient. Just as it seemed that the fast pregnancy shortened it all down from nine months to a week or so. Just as \\"Nessie\\" would grow quickly and stop at a youthful age AND so Jacob won`t have to wait long. It's just TOO perfect<br /><br />7) Love shield. That's all I'm going to say. And perhaps I may just sing \\"Love shield\\" in replace of \\"Love Shack\\" for the rest of my life. I was hoping for a lot more.<br /><br />So what happened to this book? What happened to the series?  I don't know.... I'm just glad it's over. Stephenie Meyer will probably lose a lot of fans because of this last book as well as have difficulty publishing in the future.as you have your prince charming, everything will be alright.

031606792X|4.0|I'm sorry but i loved this book.  I consider a book really good when i finish it in less then 24 hours.  Do I think it's the best in the series, no but i still enjoyed it.  Were some of the plot lines a little out there...yes.  I can understand why people didn't like it but i'm certainly not one of them.  And that's my opinion! I really think it's immature to make fun of people for liking or loving this book and vice versa.  But read it for yourself! Read the reviews and then come up with your own opinion.  I was disappointed with how everything was neatly tied up that's a definite.  I think the problem is everyone had their own expectations and you can't read a conclusion with those kind of thoughts you have to be open minded.  Bella did annoy me with the \\"classic martyr\\" thing as another reviewer pointed out and Edward's constant back and forth with the guilt and Jakes' stupidity lol.  *Spoiler*!!!!  I think the pregnancy was a little far fetched but I did like how it turned out.  One thing i did not really like was Jake imprinting on the baby because it was too much a happy ending. I actually would of liked to see him end up with Leah because they really started to understand each other and Jake would have moved on without Bella. But oh well Stephanie Meyer said she likes happy endings so that should be expected with her books! :-)  Things that i loved! *spoilers*!!  I loved Jake's point of view it really added substance to the book!  I found it humorous and refreshing!  Seth Leah and Jake added a lot to the book! :-)  I loved Bellas' new vampire experience in how she took in her surroundings for the first time!  That was wonderfully well written!    I loved their 2 (kind of) honeymoons! It was romantic although i would have loved to see the actual scene unfold.  The wedding was cool and Jake flipping out made it good and tense!  Emmett is great! Rosalie still annoys me...Alice i love and of course I love Carlisle! :-D  I'm sorry i'm in love with these characters!    Overall I loved it...and not because I feel sorry for Stephanie Meyer and i'm just a rabid fan because there were things i did not like but to me were minor so read the book and make your own assesment!
031606792X|4.0|See here's the thing. I enjoyed this book because I kind of went in with no expectations. Edward and Bella were rock solid to me, so SM could go anyway she wanted to. It was interesting seeing all these plot developments. Admittedly, the part where *SPOILER ALERT* Bella gets preggers *SPOILER ALERT OVER* was so like fanfiction, I nearly shuddered, but in the end, I still enjoyed reading it because the end result wasn't anything like fanfiction at all.     Although the plot got a bit convoluted at places, I think Stephenie's writing and humour (especially with Jacob's POV) made up for it. And being a huge Jacob fan, i'm VERY glad he ended up with his happily ever after.. even though it still kind of freaks me out..    And what's with people loving tragedies?  Everyone doesn't need to die for it to be a good book, guys.  But I am sorry there wasn't enough Edward in it for the Edward lovers..    SM gave some crazy surprises, but all in all, people with an open mind will still enjoy the book.
B0017HRCQU|4.0|the DVD is great and the bonus features are too. However the technology on the DVD made our blue-ray player outdated. We had a difficult time installing the updates, and the load time for the movie was like 5-10 minutes. Once it started, it went straight into the movie and you had to stop the movie to get to the disc menu. The menu is the most advanced i've ever seen, and I assume the cause of all the problems I had. Once we got it going- it was amazing. Just don't plan on popping popcorn an sitting down to watch a movie. This one requires a little more work to enjoy.
031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn was a big dissapointment. The reviews show as much. It isn't a good sign if a couple of hundred pages in you're finding yourself not enjoying the book. The fact that it's the last book is saddening because it's really a lousy way to end the series. Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse were not the best of the best when it came to fiction, but at least they were a good read and had a intresting plot. Breaking Dawn is just insane. My main criticism is that everything that happens is completely out of place, and has disregarded the other three books as well as butchering the characters in the process. Compare Bella, Edward, Jacob or any of them to the characters that were in Twilight. There's a big difference. Really so far the only characters i'd feel a liking to in the book would be Seth, Jasper and Jacob, and even the latter is completely messed with at the end.    *SPOILERS BELOW*    The main theme of the books is choice and sacrifice, dwelved even more deeply in Eclipse. Bella has the choice of been with Edward her soul mate, and as well as giving up her current life, also giving up her humanity. But she also has the choice of been with her werewolf friend Jacob, and having everything she stands to lose by becoming a vampire- children, family, growing old. In Eclipse she realises this all and it's consequences and makes he descision, she chooses Edward. That was what Eclipse was for, to show Bella she couldn't have it all. Well Breaking Dawn completely disregards all of this, even ignores it and pretends such an issue never exsisted. What was the point of even having the love triangle, the chapters about the harsh realities of been a vampire and newborn, and Rosalie's story, if it was just going to ignore it? Bella doesn't lose anything. In fact she get's everything. She has her godly looking husband, she has her own baby who is 'special' and who everyone loves, she's a beautiful vampire who's so powerful she can save all her vampire friends from the Volturi, the largest and most powerful coven of vampires, and believe it or not, she get's to have not only Jacob in her life but also her Dad Charlie who also 'knows' the truth. The point is that she becomes way too perfect to the point where you can't stand the character any longer. She's no longer likeable, you won't find yourself cheering for her, you'll find yourself shaking your head in disbelief instead because you can't believe one character could be so lucky and so liked by all the characters in the book. It's just insulting the direction this book went in and how much the character was changed. She's gone from been a smart, perceptive girl who stands up for herself, to nothing more than a sex crazed housewife! She didn't lose anything nor learn anything. I feel as if i'm not so much reading the finale to a romance as I am reading about a girls transition in becoming a housewife.     That's another thing. The pregnancy issuse, or as I like to call it 'The Mistake of Nessie the mutant demon spawn'. She should never have been created. I'm certain that Stephenie is going to use the excuse \\"I only said vampires couldn't impregnante other vampires, not a vampire and a human\\", she's probably going to say that since Edward was a virgin when he changed, and still a virgin when he met Bella, he still had junk in his trunk, meaning he could impregante her. I still think the whole thing makes no sense and is ridiculous. Vampire venom is strong enough to heal wounds and enchance the human body, as well as get rid of bodily functions such as tears, but it can't get rid of sperm?! Why would a vampire need it anyway? If a vampires 'dead' with no beating heart, and a female vampire wouldn't be able to get pregnant anyway why would they still need sperm? It's not like they'd need it for humans because to them humans are food. Another criticism if this turns out to be true. A male vampire can impregnate a human girl but a human male can't impregante a female vampire? Where's thefairness in that? Really I saw the whole 'Half human, Half vampire' only as an excuse for Jacob, Bella and Edward to all have happy ends, and for Jacob to still be part of Bella's life. It was a horrible over used plot, and the characters actions revolving around it were horrible. Edward asking Jacob to abort the baby and impregnate Bella without her even knowing? Does that sound right? So he's virtous enough to not want to have sex before marriage, is such a perfect man, but he's ok with taking a baby life, and open marriage? I feel bad for Edward, Breaking Dawn really messed around with him. The only characters who even appear to have any sense are Jasper or Jacob. Jacob because he can actually see how messed up everything is, and Jasper because he's actually annoyed at 'perfect Bella' when she manages to be the best newborn ever. If I was him I would have left with Alice and not returned. Get away from the madness before it's too late and they end up like Jacob.    I was expecting a happy ending. Not because I wanted it, but because fans kept mentioning how Stephenie \\"loved her characters\\" and \\"liked happy endings\\". I wouldn't have minded it. But I seriously can't handle endings which are so happy and sugar filled that even i'm sitting there not able to take it. It didn't have to be a total blood bath or depressing ending like Deathly Hallows or Sweeney Todd but would it have killed to have a realistic one? Maybe someone important dying, maybe Jacob going his own way to live his life somewhere else, Bella finally growing up and maturing? Instead we have a cute lovey dovey chapter at the end like a fairy tale, with the two in the cottage tucking their child into bed and having a romantic moment. We didn't even have a proper climax or fight with the Volturim who were defeated as quickly as they came and then even apologizing before leaving. That's like Voldemort suddenly turning round to Harry and accepting his offer to repent, it goes agaisnt the other books. NewMoon and Eclipse hyped the Volturi making them seem ruthless and powerful and instead they are made out more like a joke at the end who end up skulking away with their tails bewteen their legs. If you're going to have main villains then at least do them justice and develop them, give them more time then a couple of pages, and give them some glory. Really the book was a huge letdown for me. I feel Stephenie's liking for her characters effected the story too much, there was too much information to handle, and that the whole plot was just ridiculous.    I hope I haven't been too harsh...
B00005JPS8|2.0|This review is for theatrical release as the DVDs aren't out yet.  Besically this is your regular summer entertainment almost all the way. A superhero action movie done by-the-book. Main character (a weapons merchant/manufacturer) is caught and held hostage by generic bad guys, terrorists or just warmongers, it's not explained. What the viewer has to know is that they are bad to the bone. Their leader has plans for world domination. The hero secretly builds a powered suit of steel armor and escapes. In captivity he undergoes some sort of change of mind and doesn't want to make weapons anymore.    The conflicts in this movie are very simple and show opposing sides playing the game of escalation in which the former weapon merchant and genius inventor clearly wins.    Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) is expectedly very good, although I have a feeling he didn't have to strain himself very much playing the cartoonish Tony Stark/Ironman. He definitely makes the best from what he gets. Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love) is WASTED in a subplot which leads nowhere. At least her character (excuse my forgetting her name) gets lots of money from the Stark's company. Jeff Bridges (Big Lebowski) (another actor wasted) plays the company co-owner and, by the end of the movie, a giant evil robot, a villain whose motivation is money. There is also the general (another wasted actor, sorry for not remembering the name) who is only there to show that Stark has a friend and to prevent IM being shot down by american forces.    There was not a shred of good dialogue in the movie, except for several Stark one-liners included for laughs (some of them actually funny `tho). Special effects are cool and are the best part of the movie and prevent it from being a complete disaster. Ending is incredibly weak. The first 1/3 (or so) lets you expect something that doesn't come later. Stark escapes and from there the intelligence of the movie goes downhill.   All in all this is a good summer entertainment but nothing to ponder about after watching.
0446677450|5.0|This book was far better than expected.  Recommended to me by a close friend of my brother's, who has made a fortune for himself in investing at 30 years old.  He has a \\"passive income\\", what Robert Kiyosaki talks about in this book.  For anyone who isn't happy with working a 9-5 for the rest of their lives, constantly in search of more, this book offers great ideas in how to get started on investing and how you'll reap the rewards from it.
031606792X|2.0|I am so glad I wasn't the only one who thought this book was less than great. I really feel that this book was aimed for more of a \\"adult\\" audience that a teenage one.    Bella's character was not at all excited about anything, and hearing her describe the wedding kind of gave me a less than excited feeling. Then she gets pregnant....which is very obvious from what is described, the reader figures it out before Bella does. Then she becomes all maternal and responsible? Give me a break!Edward didn't really seem like the Edward in the previous books. The characters Bella, Jacob, and Edward all semmed so unbelievabley immature that it sort of ruined the book for me.     Also, I hope I'm not the only one found it weird that the author wouldn't describe the honeymoon scenes, but went all out ( and if I may say so, a bit overboard) with the description of Bella's pregnancy? I found some of the descriptions to be utterly digusting and most certainly not something I would advise a teen or pre-teen to read.    This was a disappointment.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer flawlessly delivered a live performance that rates to a studio version in fact better than a lot of musicians studio versions. This is no discredit to other musicians....the man is just that good. John offers pop, blues, and acoustics in his sets. What a well rounded musician not to mention he is an extremely talented songwriter as well! Must have performance.
0374280967|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  The only negative is that it's too short.  I wanted it never to end.  It was a treat.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|\\"The dvd arrived in a timely manner; it is in pristine condition consisting of two discs which include the movie and a supplemental disc which I had not realized was included.  Very good value for the price.
031606792X|1.0|Can I give this book NO stars??  I was in total love with the first three books!!  The conflicts, the complexity of the plot, the characters.  What was she thinking when she wrote this last book!?!  Did someone else write it for her??  Whas Stephenie Meyer distracted??  This book totally and completely sucks!!  It's 100% predictable the whole way through... which is quite boring to say the least.  And since I'm bored with the plot, then I begin to realize the character development sucks.  Not to mention she could have told the story in like 300 pages less.  She drug out the story way to long!  I'm so disappointed I want a refund for my book...  For those of you getting into the series, read the first three and finish the story in your head because I'm almost positive anyone could think of a better ending!  Better yet!  Don't waste your money on it... read it from the library and then give it on back...     BIG BIG BIG waste of time.  Can't believe I went and wasted my time at the midnight release of this book!  Augh...
031606792X|1.0|Ok, so first, I don't hate SM. I really liked the other three books. I read them in three days. Not one of them in three days, all of them. And I've read them multiple times since then.    That being said, I sadly have to agree with the rest of the people who did not like this book. I struggled just to finish it, and the only reason I did was I can't spend 20 of my hard earned dollars on something and not finish it. I didn't feel the characters stayed true to who we'd been led to believe they were for three books. From the second chapter they were ringing false. The plot dragged. The Volturi don't show up until so late in the book that it feels like an after thought. It's almost like SM went \\"oh... um, crap forgot them... here a little bit at the end, there you go...\\" or something.     You might try to say I was influenced by spoilers, but I wasn't. I didn't even know about them until I logged on here yesterday, and by then I had the book, so what was the point?     True stories, stories people love and come back to over and over, are stories where we feel we gained or have learned something. People love LOTR because we see and feel what Frodo had to sacrifice to save his world. (Spoilers) Bella didn't have to sacrifice anything, and she certainly didn't learn anything at all. She gained immortality, a family, a child, the happiness of her best friend (who should have left her long ago, the way she treated him), didn't go through a year long bloodlust phase and still managed to maintain her human family. It's out of character with everything we've been told about this world. The same goes for the whole Nessie sub plot. Even with the Succubus thing she tossed in there, it was a pretty weak explanation of what went on.     I realize that family is an important aspect of life, but I really don't feel that Bella learned anything from motherhood other than how special she was. The whole thing seemed to have two motives: 1) Bella is special, more so than anyone before orafter. 2) Edward is perfect, there's nothing to compare to him. (If we haven't figured this out in the last few books we haven't been paying attention. It was overkill. The pages spent describing him [again] and his flawlessness [again] is an insult to the reader's intelligence.)    If the underlying message of the whole series was the \\"only way to be happy is to find a man and have a baby, do it even if it kills you\\" then that's great. But there was such a possiblity for a stronger message to be sent to teenagers (and all people, really) about sacrifice, love and life not being perfect.     This book is perhaps the most depressing end to a good series I have ever read, and I hope to never see its likes again.
031606792X|1.0|I am profoundly, profoundly dissapointed. I'm dissapointed by the plot and its holes, I'm dissapointed by the characters acting totally out-of-character, I'm dissapointed that there was no sacrifice, that everyone got what they wanted. Most of all I'm dissapointed that I wasted so much of my time reading this book and that I was left feeling first slightly depressed, then disgruntled, and then just plain angry.    All I can say is if you are a Twilight fan, I know you will read this book, there is no way you wont, but when you do, get it from the library or keep the receipt.     Breaking Dawn = Total waste of time.
031606792X|5.0|I started reading this book not knowing what to expect. I had thoroughly enjoyed the last three books of Ms. Meyer's series, but I wasn't so sure about this particular novel. I was not dissapointed.    Throughout the book, I laughed so hard I had to stop reading five times, cried twice, and threw down the book in anger once. But almost the entire time, I was smiling. The story tugged at my heart in such a way that it was impossible not to smile. I have always been an hopeless romantic, and the idea of a love that could last forever is irresistable.    Yes, this book did tie up everything with a bow, but not a neat one. The twists and turns throughout the story made me gasp, hold my breath, and bite my nails down to a quick. Unlike some are saying, the message was not lost. In my opinion, the message Ms. Meyer was trying to convey was that love can overcome all obstacles.    I will not give away the ending, but I will tell you this. I did not put that book down unsatisfied, and I look forward to reading it again.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Awesome movie, a must see for any Gater! Was interesting to see all the old system lords united back once again- same actors/actresses to hold true to form. It was especially great to see Jack back and remain alive (no leaks here- see the movie to see what I mean!). Overall super- wife and I had one question- what happened to the Cameron that went back and how does he play the family genealogy?  Looking forward to more SG movies down the road!
031606792X|2.0|*****Spoilers*****        I don't know what to say after reading this book. I feel like a traitor by not liking Breaking Dawn, but there it is.  I loved the first three books, I've read them at least five times each, I went to the midnight release party and I was pumped for this book, and now I feel deflated.  Breaking Dawn seemed detached from the rest of the series, like SM didn't even write it.  I didn't mind so much that Bella became pregnant, but I was more than a little disturbed, disappointed and a little nauseated that Jacob would imprint Bella and Edwards baby. Get a life dude. He could have still been a good friend and helped them without that. What was the point of the mushy heart to heart with Leah if they weren't going to get together? I loved that idea. Renesmee?? Nessie?? Really?? And why didn't Carlise see that the baby needed blood before? I did.      I always love Emmett, Jasper and Rosalie. And Alice rocks. And I love meeting the eclectic group of vampires, that was great. Breaking Dawn wasn't good or bad, I wish I had stopped at Eclipse.  Overall poor ending to a fabulous series.
031606792X|3.0|Coming from somebody with a level head, this book was kind of...different.    I didn't completely obsess with the first 3 books, I just loved reading them, thought they were amazing. Had great ideas, great concepts.    But this book...seemed like it was from a different author of some sort. It isn't 'bad', it was nice to read, just not what I expected when I was so excited to get it and read it.     And in this book, I found myself like hyper aware of the fact that Edward and Bella always fight for the blame. They both self pitty too much, and Bella was just down right idiotic in this last book. I don't know...wasn't the biggest fan of the book but I wouldn't go as far to say it sucked. I like it, just not what I thought it would be.
031606792X|5.0|I just have to say that I am so pleased with this book, and I loved it as much as I did the first three. I actually think I loved it more in some ways! I stayed spoiler free, and it was worth the ride.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I think that I've seen just about every version made of this Jane Austen classic. This is such a great and endearing story that it is hard to mess it up (although the Bollywood bad-acid-trip \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" came very close!) But director, Joe Wright, showed that he was up to the task, doing a great job of retelling the foibles of the Bennet sisters. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is strong and reminscent of a contemporary feminist while remaining true to the mores of the period. Matthew Macfadyen isn't the best Mr. Darcy, but it's hard to come behind the magnificent Colin Firth who played the role in 1995 as if he lived across the road from Jane Austin. Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennet) shines as a mother on a well-planned mission to marry off FIVE daughters. Rosamund Pike (Jane) is the classic English rose while Talulah Riley's portrayal of Mary is not the usual ugly wallflower. Newcomers Jena Malone and Carey Mulligan (Lydia and Kitty) make the best clueless Victorian \\"hoochies\\" ever! But the real treat here is Donald Sutherland as the estrogen drowned Mr. Bennet. He has masterfully executed an unexpected role for him, exhibiting a refreshing tongue-in-cheek patience. Dame Judi Dench, always in top form, makes the best Lady Catherine De Bourgh to date. Unlike the previous adaptations, here the viewer is not bounced back and forth between London and the countryside locations and the costumes aren't overly fussy, giving the overall production an understated lushness. I would love to see what Joe Wright could do with \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Emma\\".
B000NDI3SK|4.0|As someone who watched it when it was first broadcast, and again recently, I still find it an enthralling documentary. It's a pity other reviewers have concentrated on the lack of both gee-whizz computer graphics and sound-effects, but they should realise that it was made in a not-so-distant time when people didn't collectively suffer from ADD, and had the ability to concentrate and think. Dr Bronowski's commentary is fascinating and riveting, and that's what it is about. TAOM is a brilliant educational tool which remains as relevant now as ever. And for those who have a problem with the title, well, to put it in your generation's vernacular - build a bridge and get over it. It's a study of the human race; not an exercise in gender appeasement.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|As expected, Denzel Washington is in excellent form. I cannot even imagine him being any better, considering the body of work he has amassed during his career. Washington was eerily on point in \\"Malcolm X\\", smoothly sensual in \\"Mo Better Blues\\", and so intense in \\"Training Day\\" that he made me want to marry a thug!<br /><br />In this flick, he exhibits everything that makes Denzel a master at his craft. His character is arrogant, thuggish, and intuitive. While I'm not a fan of director Spike Lee's choice of projects over the years, I find his crisp cinematography, inventive camera angles, intelligent editing, and moving jazzy soundtracks very impressive and a dominant thread in all of his films. The growth in these areas are evident here, exhibiting an inter-dependent and mutually beneficial relationship in this, Washington and Lee's fourth film together.<br /><br />As for the other characters, Jodie Foster's talents are wasted - she just coasted through the film, with overtones of Clarice in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". It seems as if she was included so that the movie trailer announcer could say \\"Academy Award Winner\\" twice! As for Clive Owen, this is the best that I have ever seen him, as charismatic and sympathetic as Hannibal Lechter. Chiwetel Ejiofor holds his own against the dominant Washington, giving the star the requisite amount of support and respect. The only person that I found totally out of place was that actress was who played Denzel's girlfriend. It took a lot more time than I usually allot to researching my reviews to find out who she was. I think her name is Cassandra Freeman. She had one film role before this and IT SHOWS! Her whole role could have been portrayed just as easily over the phone. In addition to Freeman's \\"school play\\" acting skills, her part was non-essential to the plot and far too young for the maturing Washington. She is a full THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER than Washington! What the ....?! For some reason, Hollywood seems to thrive on the older-man-way-too-much-younger-woman theme, instead of giving these female roles to \\"les femmes d'un certain âge\\". Look at whose dominating the box office and award shows: Helen Mirren (\\"The Queen\\"), Meryl Streep (\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\"), and Judi Dench (\\"Notes on a Scandal\\"), etc. I can see the director not wasting such a vapid role on a top actress but, either beef up the role to make it worthy of a Angela Bassett, or have the lines called in, \\"Charlie's Angels\\"-style.r-man-way-too-much-younger-woman theme, instead of giving these female roles to \\"les femmes d'un certain âge\\".

031606792X|5.0|I started reading the second I got home from the midnight release and didn't put it down until I finished the novel about 7AM.  I was blown away - really, I actually laughed and cried and woke up my hubby screaming \\"Yes!!!\\" at least once.  Stephenie Meyer has done it again - this is probably my favorite of the 4 in the series.  I have seen a few reviews complaining about the happy endings and Bella's not having to give up anything.  Frankly - this is FANTASY!  Does anyone out there really believe vampires exist?  No - but it didn't stop us from loving the series (and, of course a certain vampire and/or werewolf...).  Nope, things don't always work out in real life just perfectly - but then again, perfect vampire guys aren't out there either, right?  And really, I do not understand the tendency some have to look for some deep \\"message\\" to young girls out there - this is ENTERTAINMENT, not a life lesson.  And besides - look how Bella turns out.  Some complained before that she was a bad role model because she was always being rescued, etc. - when she could not possibly have been otherwise as a mortal surrounded by immortal beings with super powers thrown in.  Now, she handled her change better than any known vamp, has a fantastic super power of her own - one that, incidentally, probably saved the entire family and their friends during the final show down with the Volturi - and now she's a bad role model because everything turned out RIGHT for her??  Yeesh.  The important part for me was that the characters all stayed true to themselves and behaved as they would have to given their individual personalities.  Great story, lots of unexpected twists and turns, and after all Bella & Edward had going against them, I was THRILLED to see everything work out for them. The Jacob imprinting on Nessie thing took me completely by suprise, but after I stopped going, \\"What?  WHAT!?\\" I liked it - Bella gets to have Jacob as family, Edward and Jacob finally get along, and there is a lasting bond between the werewolves and vampires that brings an end to their long-standing hatred of one another.  Meyer wrapped up all the loose ends quite nicely.  Now I just have to wait for Midnight Sun.....and for my 3 daughters to finish so I can talk to them without ruining it with spoilers!
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I really tried hard not to like this movie, believing it to be for the kiddies, but it turned out to be a really pleasant surprise. Gene Wilder's \\"Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory\\" was tongue-in-cheek delightful in 1971 and, here, Tim Burton creates another masterful rendition - without LSD!!<br /><br />Young Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket is a refreshingly unpretentious child, with a wide-eyed innocence, a rarity among today's movie youth. I'm so sick of Haley Joel Osment (whose transformation from a child to a teen actor is as squeeky as his voice change) and Dakota Fanning (she's already developed the Hollywood Red Carpet fake-me-out \\"Opened Mouth Molar Exposing Smile\\" and \\"The Left Leg Crossed Over The Right From The Crotch\\" pose of her older contemporaries). The fabulous Helena Bonham Carter portrays a down-and-out mother with the same English grace and delicance as she does a noblewoman. But, it's under-rated actor Gordeep \\"Deep\\" Roy, cloned into a kazillion cavity-creating Oompa-Loompas, who really steals the show. He rocks more latex here than a Trojan factory!<br /><br />It's obvious that Johnny Depp puts a lot of thought into the roles that he chooses and he's not ashamed to just act a fool as evidenced by \\"Ed Wood\\" and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\". But, in the wake of the Michael Jackson scandals, Johnny Depp's domino-toothed Willie Wonka is a tad disturbing. I mean, holding a contest to lure young children \\"to tour your playland\\" doesn't really work for me right now.<br /><br />However, in the spirit of the 1964 book by British writer Roald Dahl, I decided not to be too literal in watching this. I just got out a pint of Haagen-Dazs ice cream, added a double-dose of hot fudge and a whole can of whipped cream, put on my bunny slippers, and enjoyed the ride.
031606792X|5.0|What's everyone's problem??.. I love all these books. Breaking Dawn now included. These books are not meant for 10 year old little girls..if your letting your young kids read them than that's your fault. She couldn;t make everyone happy.. as she said someone was bound to be upset with the way she decided to end it.     I think it ended well. I am finally able to have closure and I can sleep. I LOVED IT
B000286RKW|5.0|This is the best of the best films in the contemporary gangster/Mafioso genre. I have watched it so many times that I think the FBI has put hidden cameras in my house and wiretapped my phones. Henry Hill WISHES that he looked as good as the young Ray Liotta. It's hard to watch Lorraine Bracco as the serious, but slightly neurotic, Dr. Jennifer Melfi on \\"The Sopranos\\" after repeatedly watching her flush tens of thousands of coke down the toilet. But the real star in this film is the psychotic Joe Pesci. There was no way of predicting what would set him off. I'm not going to give the surprises away here but, no matter how many times I watch the movie, I still get sucked in!!
031606792X|2.0|I must say, considering how good Eclipse was in comparison to her previous works, I expected that Meyer would be able to come up with a satisfying ending to what started out as a good series. I was wrong.<br /><br />(SPOILERS)<br /><br /> To start off, I want to say that I'm really disappointed with how Bella turned out. She has none of her old wit or charm, in fact, shes incredibly dull. When she finds out shes pregnant, no intense emotions crop up from the fact that well...shes going to be a MOTHER. Considering the high rates of teen pregnancy in this country, I was expecting Meyer to have Bella reflect upon the gravity of her decision to have sex and, ultimately, a child. Bella does neither, and instead gives the reader no hint to her true emotions. Another thing that bothered me was the graphic nature of Bella's childbirth. Sure, the author can't describe the intimacy that Bella and Edward shared when they had sex, but she can sure as hell describe Bella's blood covered, withered self as shes giving birth. Also, Edward has become incredibly angsty in this book. He may be over 100 years old, but he still acts as though hes 18.<br /><br />I'm sorry to all you die hards out there. I loved this series as much as you did, but...the author should have taken a more grounded approach when writing this one. I wish I had only read Twilight and left the rest to my imagination.
6304884419|5.0|This is a film that I can watch a kazillion times and still not get enough. Chazz Palminteri is one of the scariest actors in gangster history. However, his insight into the world that he was born in was touching. Robert De Niro shines as a frustrated father trying to save his son from the streets.
031606792X|1.0|I'll be honest here: I was spoiled for this book before its release. Amazingly enough, however, I refused to believe the rumors, simply because I did not believe Meyer could come up with a plot that contrived.     Unfortunately, they were all true. Breaking Dawn is, without a doubt, the weakest book of the entire series. I'll do my best to not give away any plot details, but readers be warned: do NOT purchase this book. If you absolutely must know what happens, check out a copy from the library. Borrow it from a friend. This book is simply NOT worth the money.     Readers looking for any deeper meanings in the books will be HIGHLY disappointed in this concluding novel. Meyer manages to negate every piece of symbolism or metaphor used previously, while completely invalidating every relationship developed in the earlier books (including the relationship between Edward and Bella, no less!). As if that weren't accomplishment enough, Meyer crosses the line between \\"creative\\" and \\"laughably unbelievable\\" regarding plot events, and her writing style is what a kind person could call \\"unpolished\\" at best. I have no idea what her editors were thinking.     Simply put, spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.
B000M341QE|5.0|I just happened to see this movie the night before the Academy Awards. I'm not going to spoil the film for those of you who haven't seen it by revealing the ending but I was blown away by the end.  Totally unexpected and just the way a movie should be.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is superb here. His growth as an actor is amazing.  Jack Nicholson is, well, Jack Nicholson, often reminding me of his role in \\"The Shining\\".  And Matt Damon \\"mans up\\" in a way that will surprise all.  Everyone in this flick does a masterful job.  However, although the only signigicant female, Vera Farmiga, was out of her league here.  If the plan was for her role to be downplayed, it would have worked better if she wasn't even in the movie - no one would have missed her.  Again, another part that could just as easily been done as a \\"phone in\\".  And, while I love Anthony Anderson, he also seems like he just wandered onto the set so Martin Scorsese factored him in.<br /><br />This is one of the very best movies of all time.  I'm glad that Scorsese finally won an Oscar, but it's hard to say if this was his best, with \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Kings of New York\\", \\"The Aviator\\", and the magnificent \\"Raging Bull\\".  WOW!  Who needs an Oscar with a body of work like that?!  Don't worry about statuettes, Marty - keep getting your name on checks!!
031606792X|1.0|As I sit here and attempt to create a review about this \\"book\\" words seem to fail me as I ponder this disgusting excuse of literature. I WAITED 8 GOD-FORSAKEN HOURS ON A STAGNANT LINE, AND STAYED UP UNTIL 4:30AM TO FINISH THIS BOOK AND I WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED. A fan of the first three books, I used to uphold Ms. Meyer in a high position, regarding her as a wonderful new author. The first three books were engaging, innovative and gripping from the beginning. The fourth book However, bathed in immense amounts of publicity and HYPE, proved to be a complete and total disaster as Ms. Meyer took NO RISK WHATSOEVER IS HER SORRY EXCUSE OF WRITING, and stuck to old, worn out predictable outcomes. As the fourth and final book in the saga, BREAKING DAWN should have been chock full o' groundbreaking twists, death, self-realization and conclusions. HOW ABSOLUTELY IDIOTIC WAS IT TO END THE BOOK IN dispicable display of affection and happiness for all the main characters. HOW AFRAID COULD SHE HAVE POSSIBILY BEEN OF THE FANS THAT SHE WOULD TAKE ASOLUTELY NO RISK WHATSOEVER. If my opinion is to be asked i BEG ALL OF YOU NOT TO WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS ABSOLUTE PIECE OF GARBAGE. it 100% ruinedthe saga for me and it was a waste of my $20, and my 6 hours. THANK YOU STEPHANIE MEYER FOR TOTALLY RUINING YOUR ONCE STERLING SAGA, AND FOR WASTING ALL OF OUR TIME, EFFORT AND MONEY ON YOUR PIECE OF CRAP. Have a nice day!
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This was the most confusing crock that I have watched in a long time.  Already about an hour too long, I had to keep rewinding segments because I thought that I missed something.  But I didn't miss anything - the producers and director did - they missed what makes a really good movie.  The subject matter is confusing enough without trying to interweave a \\"Crash\\"-type scenario across continents and cultures.  I'm still trying to figure out how the Mexican nanny fits in and she was the most sympathetic character.  The Japanese segment could have been left out altogether - deaf students, weapons, detectives, discos - just too much to digest, with no sake to wash it down with.  Leave this one alone and watch \\"Happy Feet\\" - fast moving penguins make more sense with their flippers than this movie does!
B000099T3P|5.0|CRITTERS is my favorite movie of it's type. I like it even more than GREMLINS (which I love), and far more than any of the other \\"puppet-monster\\" movies that came out (Ghoulies, Hobgoblins, etc.). CRITTERS takes us to the tiny town of Grovers Mill, Kansas, the site of an alien invasion. It seems that a renegade bunch of crites ( little, furry, carnivorous space monsters) have escaped from intergalactic prison, and headed straight toward earth for a snack (us)! This leads to a night of horror and hilarity, when the rolly creatures arrive and begin eating any / all flesh in sight! Two extraterrestrial bounty hunters are dispatched to hunt down and destroy the crites before they can fully satisfy their insatiable appetites. The bounty hunters are hilarious, as they can make themselves look like anyone they encounter, which means that one of them looks like a then-current (1986) MTV-type rock star, while his cohort winds up being the sheriff's deputy, the town preacher, and a farm-hand! Now, THAT'S comedy! Most of the CRITTER action takes place at the Brown family farm, where the lovely, legendary Dee Wallace (The Hills Have Eyes, The Howling, Cujo, The Frighteners, etc.) plays Mrs. Brown, trying to survive the alien onslaught w/ her husband and kids. M. Emmet Walsh (Blood Simple) is the sheriff, and a young, pony-tailed (!!) Billy Zane (Dead Calm, Memory) is the ill-fated boyfriend of the Brown's teenage daughter. CRITTERS is a fun, semi-scary movie w/ cute lil' fur-balls that have huge mouths full of razor-sharp, flesh-ripping teeth! Enjoy...
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Our family had just been hit with another development in a devastating event which we had been trying to deal with for 10 years when \\"Clerks I\\" and \\"Clerks II\\" was delivered to our house. If you just want to decompress, chill out, and think about absolutely nothing \\"grown up\\", this is the movie for you. An hour and a half of sheer hilarity with some of the best deadpan acting since Charlie Chaplin. A rollicking good time. Part of the beauty of shoestring budget films is that every take must count. And whatever is deleted is just too funny for the world to handle. Thank you, Kevin Smith, for giving us a little while to just be silly.
031606792X|5.0|I understand what others are saying with there negative reviews, and I don't blame them for thinking that way. However I believe that they are taking a lot of things the wrong way. This review has spoilers to the book, please do not read any further if you have not yet read the book.<br />She is not saying that teen pregnancy is the way to go, Bella and Edward are married adults, legal in every way. They are also not normal, any normal teenager who decides to get married and have a child with no regard to schooling and money needs a wake up call. Vampires have the money, plus all the time in the world to study everything in the world.<br />I am a 24 year old mother, who did not want children. However, when I found out that I was pregnant, there was nothing that could make me choose not to have it, I fell in love instantly, the first kick was magic, proof that there was a little person in there. As far as Bella actually getting pregnant, so what? Who's to say that's not possible, I was very happy to read that she was. They are suck a strongly bonded family and a child just brings them more together. There is nothing wrong with Bella enjoying her honeymoon and wanting to stretch it out a little longer, that is human nature.<br />Jacob imprinting on the baby is a little weird, but it's not a sexual thing. After a little thinking about it it's fine. How much about these book are fantasy? Do you really understand vampires? shape-shifters? Are you in any place to judge them, that's like judging people by there religion.<br />I LOVED this book, I couldn't be happier. This is how she invisioned the book ending from the start, this is what was always going to happen. I couldn't stop reading, I read for 13 hours straight yesterday. I hope that many other like this book and that you give it a chance even with the negative reviews.
031606792X|1.0|I had a problem with the message of 'to be happy, a woman needs a baby,' in the first three books but I let it go.<br /><br />Then it continues, and of course, to lead a happy and fulfilling life BELLA needs a baby. How this works out, I can't comprehend, because sweat? No, vampires don't have it. Tears? Nope. Blood? Nuh-uh. Sperm? Absolutely. But ova? No way.<br /><br />But I'm not going to argue the logic of fantasy writing. That would go nowhere.<br /><br />Instead I'm going to point out the various bad messages and sexist subtexts that run unchecked through the pages of Breaking Dawn (and through some of the earlier books, too).<br /><br />The book starts out with Bella unsure of marrying Edward. Of course. She didn't want to marry him at all at first. But of course seeing him makes her change her mind. Because that's a good trait for young women to have. To be so malleable to the wills of their boyfriends that they're willing to abandon their inhibitions and values simply for the sake of someone else's happiness.<br /><br />And you know what? It's okay, girls, to be pregnant at the age of eighteen or nineteen. Don't freak out. Don't be scared. You're not too young. As long as you have a rich man to take care of you, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Not only did Bella not originally want to be married, and not only did she not have any desire for children, but the second she found out she was pregnant her heart swelled to twice its size.<br /><br />And you know what? You never have to develop any sense of independence. Ever. Bella sure didn't.<br /><br />Another thing? Everything works out all the time (the same thing seems to happen in The Host, another book of Meyer's). By the end of everything, Jacob had somebody, and that somebody was Edward and Bella's child.<br /><br />To be frank, this book was awful, and I can't imagine what Meyer is playing at with it.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Here is a nice young fella who is all archeology and adventure just like...uh... Indy. And he draws Indy into the plot to save his mother--Mary.  And the bit with the hat.... just too much of a set up.  Not as good as the originals but might help a new Indy style adventure series start up.  Young Indy did okay.  New younger...uh...guy.. might do okay too--has the right background for it--with his mother and all.  Don't think worth the DVD unless you are a die hard true Indy fan. Unless there really will be alternate ending options....

031606792X|4.0|I will admit at the start, the only thing that drew me to the other books were the plots. The characters just bugged me. Yes, even Edward! Actually mostly Edward...    Weirdly enough, seeing how most people hate this book, I think it is my favorite. At the beginning of course, when Bella was pregnant I was a little \\"Okay. This is taking it a bit too far...\\" but then Renesmee was just such a cute key little character. I think it was a good wrap-up to the series. I really preferred Bella as a vampire and even Edward was easier to like.    And I know for some it is really creepy that Jacob imprinted on a newborn - but this was explained in Eclipse. He isn't madly in love with her or anything, he just lives for her. That means he'll be anything she needs - a father, a brother, a mentor, and when she is older - probably a lover. He isn't lustful, she is just the key to his universe and it was by no choice of his own! I was relieved that Meyer resolved that issue. I was really hating Jacob and Bella at the end of Eclipse.    I really liked this book. I would have given it 5 Stars after I finished but then I got four hours of sleep and my brain was punishing me for about eight straight hours of reading. I liked the book at first, but not when I kept back-flashing to random excerpts in the book against my will.    I know...weird. But seriously - if you have read the three other books, this one (in my opinion) is the best. You actually like the characters. Bella isn't so whiny or annoying and for you Edward-obsessed, he is more lovable. And of course you get to see all the other cool little vampires!!!
031606792X|1.0|So bummed. Loved the first few chapters but then it turned into something I did not even recognize...or had any interest in. Very far-fetched and I felt like there was a LOT of unnecessary dialogue just to fill pages. My head is spinning. Cannot believe that such an unbelievable series (first three books) was ruined with an awful finale. It seems like this one was rushed or that ideas were put together in a way that just didn't fit. Had to fight to get through it. I just hated it.

B0000025T6|4.0|Twelve and a half years after the release of his debut, Greetings from Asbury Park N.J. and two years after The River was delivered, Bruce Springsteen gave us Nebraska. This 1982 record represented an abrupt change in direction for this most popular of American artists. Springsteen's new course was so surprising and dramatic that you would be hard-pressed to find adequate words to describe it to a fan who had not yet been exposed. Gone are the horns; gone are Springsteen's electric guitar solos; gone are the anthems. We are no longer cruising in Jersey. We have moved to the mid-west and we are running from murder. Rock music is replaced by folk music - not gentle folk music either, but, rather, sparse music that is roots-driven, edgy and minimalist. We have Springsteen, his acoustic guitar and his harmonica. There is no-one else. On his prior recordings Springsteen told many stories that were not exactly uplifting. He wrote of economic and romantic hardships. On Nebraska he addresses violent death, the narrator's longing for a time when life was better and suicidal depression brought on by plant closings. The bleakness is unrelenting. The narrator of each song is at one stage of despair or another. Some suggest that the final cut, Reason to Believe, offers some hope. I don't think so. These people may think that they have a reason to believe but in reality they are done like toast.<br /><br />If you love Born to Run or Born in the USA there is absolutely no guaranty that you'll appreciate Nebraska. By the same token, if you are turned off by Springsteen's \\"anthemic\\" rockers but enjoy, say, the moody cds released by Johnny Cash in his last years then this may be for you.. Nebraska doesn't represent \\"popular\\" music. These aren't background songs for a cocktail party! The record is not an easy listen. However, if you do play it you must listen. The power is in the lyrics.
031606792X|2.0|!!!SPOILER!!!    I finished the book and I don't know if I liked it or not yet, but here are some thoughts:     *Book One of Breaking Dawn: Perfect and lovely. This felt like the book I was waiting for, the book that fit in nicely with the series. I truly, truly enjoyed this section very much.     *Book Two: This section was absurd to me. I saw the pregnancy thing coming from a mile away and at first I was amused. But then she started dying, there was the Rosalie thing and the Edward self-loathing thing and it got to be a bit weird. Well, a lot weird. It didn't feel like Stephanie Meyer. It didn't feel like Bella and Edward. I am ALL for stories changing and characters evolving, but this was kind of crazy (to me, no offense to those that loved it). And she's just 18! It was just... not Twilight. But I guess that's the point. I hated that it was from Jacob's perspective at first, but I got over that. I even started to enjoy his POV.     *Book three: This section was ok. There were ridiculous parts but also great parts, so it averages out to ok. I really loved the description of Bella as a newborn vampire. I liked her powers and her new life. It was cool. I saw the imprinting thing coming as soon as Bella got pregnant, so that wasn't a surprise. The baby... just so weird. The character itself was cool (but what and awful name!) I dunno, it just didn't seem to fit the book. She has a neat power and seemed cute, but I couldn't get over it. I couldn't get over the whole vampire parent at 18 thing. It felt out of place. And all the vampires coming at once and almost no fighting at the end... it was just weird. Again, it didn't seem right. I'm glad Edward and Bella got their happily ever after - especially because it felt like we kind of lost Edward after section one. But it all wrapped up way too neatly. And no battle... alas...     Now, with all that said, Steph is the author, not me. She can take her book down any path she pleases. And I didn't HATE it. It's her series,her decision. And I still like her and I still love the first three books. Just can't shake the feeling of disappointment from this one. Oh well.
031606792X|5.0|I'm still deciding how much I like this book. But even if it is not the best book I have read, it is still without a doubt a five star.  I'm not sure if it is the best book in the series-I will need to let it set in to decide that- but it is a very entertaining book. Maybe a little anti-climatic, but certainly full of emotion.    Like others have said, I think it does suffer from trying to tie everything up with a bow. But Renesmee overshadows all shortcomings. Possibly the most adorable character ever created, in my book.
031606792X|1.0|I loved, loved, loved Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. Loved them. But Breaking Dawn was the biggest most disgusting disappointment I could have possibly imagined. Really. The characters were were not themselves, the story was disjointed, it needed some MAJOR editing and overall I feel so sad that the series had to end this way. I trusted that Stephenie Meyer, no matter how she ended this saga, would leave us all at peace - instead she left me with a mess! Don't read it. Jut let the series end with Eclipse in your mind - you'll be so much happier!
0060797509|5.0|My sons love this story.  When our old book was too torn-up to read I ordered this copy.  I didn't receive any discount off the list price through Amazon, but the fiddle charm necklace was a nice touch.  My 4 year-old was so excited about it.  He wore it until the chain broke!
031606792X|1.0|No, really. Zero stars. Maybe half a star if I want to be generous and credit her for taking the time to write this, but as it was 800 pages that ought to have been 200 at most, zero is more appropriate.    I was never a Twilight fan. As per my review of the first book, I found it laughable, juvenile, and sending out a horrible message. But I also acknowledged that Stephenie Meyer had potential to take this series above and beyond had she waited and developed her writing. Revised the drafts more often. Given herself several years between her dream and going to a publisher.    Because I'm a writer. I'm young, so not yet a published writer (I've not yet attempted), but I'm a writer. I know she loves her characters despite the fact that they all fall flat (with mild exceptions in Jacob, but even Jacob is an undesirable character when compared to protagonists in other YA novels). They fall so flat that you can't even see them as characters anymore. They're voids for your own 'pick and place' fantasies. You slide in as Bella. Your dream slides in as Edward. Or perhaps Jacob.    The point is that the main reason I know Meyer needed far more time to write this series is Breaking Dawn. Breaking Dawn, for all that I detest Twilight, made Twilight gleam and shine with potential. I write in my own original fantasy with, yes, my own concept of vampires (though they are not actually prevalent in what I do--just formed so in case they do appear, I know what I'm doing). The one thing I know a fantasy author should never do is contradict her own canon for the sake of getting what he or she wants out of the story. It proves to me that Twilight and its predecessors were nothing but wish-fulfillment. Meyer didn't honestly care that she had said vampires could not reproduce. She seemed to forget that Bella was phobic of blood. Within one book she had Bella going from disliking a young marriage to embracing it, and not only that, but embracing a child that was breaking her ribs and growing nine times faster than any other fetus. A fetus born (or rather, bitten from her mother's corpse by her own father) with a full set of teeth, mind you.    Wish-fulfillment. I honestly admit I wrote mostly wish-fulfillment when I started writing as a young girl. Who doesn't? So if you never grow out of that, Meyer's work seems like a masterpiece. Because, as I said, Meyer never had the chance to understand the finer points of creating fiction, her books read like any teenager's romance story.    Even fans will tell you that her characters, primarily Bella, are Mary Sues and Gary Stus. By Breaking Dawn, I think Meyer had fully given into the curse. Bella was not only the most controlled vampire (and a newborn one, at that!), she could outjump Edward, hurt Edward, run away from potential victims, and basically act like a hornier version of her human self. The Cullens and everyone else were surprised at her level of ability. And, of course, she had the protection shield up the entire time, even prior to becoming a vampire (and possibly the only consistent factor in all four books, so for that I applaud Meyer, even if this trait is just another Mary Sue quality).    Unfortunately, Meyer has never had to deal with a lot of criticism from major names and publishing houses. She was not rejected. She was paid a lot of money and given a book deal. The Host exemplifies the fact that Meyer sees herself as a serious author when in fact she still has a lot of growing up to do. I've been writing since I learned how and yet I still need plenty of more maturing before I'll dare approach a publisher. That Meyer is allowed to seemingly do whatever she pleases caused more than a small disaster in this fourth book.    First of all, she uses the word 'manfully'. I don't think I need to even expand.    The amount of 'unwritten' sex scenes in this book skyrockets. Just because they're married? Apparently. Personally, I'm all for actually writing the sex scene itself, especially if it'sbeen awaited for three books. Describing the emotions someone feels is as good as describing the actions, but all we get is the sign of a rape scene.    Oh, right. The morning after. Once again proving that she doesn't realize Bella sets feminism back a century, if not more, Meyer gives us the most horrifying first time you could ever imagine. Pillows torn up, headboard smashed, bruises all over Bella's body. Edward charmingly telling her he did all he could to stop himself tearing her up (which, again, I don't see as romantic or flattering--it's like dating a serial killer and hearing him joke that you could be his next victim if he ever loses control). And if that doesn't make you cringe, Edward angsts about what he did and Bella begs and cries for more sex when he refuses. Essentially raping him because he sure as hell isn't interested and it definitely isn't fair to test him. But has Bella ever shown any outright caring towards him and what he needs to do to keep himself sane? No.    Oh, and since I've just reminded myself, Bella's time as a vampire seems a lot less overdramatic than what Edward made it out to be. Constantly talking of how difficult it was. How they had to keep control. How it hurt to be turned. Bella seemed to experience none of it. There was only a chance in her self-esteem and a lot less whining (which was a nice break).    One of the reasons why a lot of people dislike the HP epilogue (to mention HP because everyone compares her, unfairly, to JKR) is that it tied everything up so neatly and predictably that for many people, it wasn't what they needed. The names of the children, for example, were a little too fluffy to swallow. But that epilogue, for all that people were dissatisfied by it, looks good when held up to the light Breaking Drawn gives off.    Breaking Dawn could have ended in about a half dozen different places. There were a lot of good points for conclusion. But, of course, Meyer pulled her usual '200 pages of plot' at the veryend, and unlike the other books, there was absolutely no plot within this plot. No real epic battle. Just a lot of staring and puffing chests. But, as I believed from book one, the 'mean nasty icky vampires' who always want to kill Bella or people around her are, of course, secondary to the focus of the book, which is solely Edward and Bella. I think the fact that Meyer threw just about every character under the bus, including Jacob, proves this. In fact, the first book should prove it. Meyer just needed to not pretend she was writing anything other than a romance novel. Cut out the convoluted plot and you can cut the books down to two and save people a lot of grief. Except that their romance is absolutely sickening and ill-conceived, so perhaps it wouldn't save grief at all.    Finally, let's touch on the Nessie + Jacob bit, as that has been a big bone of contention. Jacob the pedophile, is that what Stephenie Meyer wanted to portray? Listen, before anyone gets angry, I don't think Jacob is really a pedophile, nor do I think Meyer meant for him to come off that way, but, let's face it, a months' old (toddler-sized and mentally matured) child pats his knee and calls him her Jacob and she doesn't mean it platonically.    All-in-all, Breaking Dawn was exactly what I expected from her, but still deplorable. Moreso than the other three books, especially the first. I still wish Meyer had backed off and written them with more practice. I still wish Meyer would see the anti-feminist nature of Bella's relationship (which is bordering on the extremely abusive). I still wish Meyer would experience what all writers experience--a little bit of hardship to sweeten the pot. She just has the pot and she's taking advantage of it with books that are as far from good reads as possible.
0440234743|4.0|Grisham brings his page-turning style to a contested will.  Aged billionaire Troy Phelan commits suicide, leaving behind a questionable hand-written will and angry heirs (six kids and three ex-wives) who get nothing beyond their debts erased.  The beneficiary is Troy's previously unknown illegitimate daughter Rachel, who lives as a penniless missionary among the Indians somewhere in the vast wilderness of Brazil. Naturally, the greedy heirs and their unscrupulous lawyers contest the will (claiming Troy was insane), while the exector plucks an acoholic attorney (Nate) from rehab to seach for Rachel in Brazil.  Grisham provides adventurous reading as Nate braves storms, floods, snakes, mosquito-borne diseases and hostile natives while traveling up the Pantanal River in search of Rachel. At the same time, we see how low the Phelan heirs and their sleazy lawyers will sink to grab part of that $11 billion estate.  But lest you lose faith in human nature, some redemption is mixed in with the mounds of sleaze.     I like Grisham's page-turning style and legal adventurism, but felt finding Rachel was too easy, and he took too long to get to the tepid ending. Still, if this isn't the top Grisham effort, it still makes very good reading.
031606792X|5.0|I admit, I cheated. I looked at the reviews of the book before I actually read Breaking Dawn.  I was expecting a crash and burn. Not so. I just finished the book, and I absolutely LOVE it.   Sure, there's less romance and more dialogue in BD than in the other books, but you can't expect Bella and Edward to always have that much drama--Bella despairing over Edward, Edward's overbearing protectiveness, etc--in their relationship.  Meyer has portrayed Bella's journey to maturity wonderfully through the saga.   I especially loved Bella's transition from human to vampire. Although the turned Bella is physically perfect and graceful, she remains \\"so Bella\\". Charlie's discovery was also a huge relief.  In the end, even Jacob gets his happy ending. What's not to like?  Maybe Bella does get everything she wants, and it IS all too perfect. So? If I had to give any fictional couple a disgustingly happy ending, it would be Bella and Edward. They deserve it!

But for this one, I have to create my own:<br /><br />- Prose/writing style: 4<br />It's not the writing that makes this like watching a train wreck about to occur - it's the plot that zings along and you just know the worst is coming.  Solid, engaging writing.<br /><br />- Page-turning, Psychological Thriller/Plot and Pace: 4.5 stars<br />With psychological suspense which continues to build it's a \\"I can't put this down\\" type book.  It's been one of the few recently where foregoing sleep to keep going with it was the most enjoyable option.<br /><br />You'll know who did it half way in.  That doesn't stop you being caught in the action - or by having a couple of occassional curve balls occassionally thrown at you. And despite knowing where it was going, I was definitely surprised by how some things played out.<br /><br />- Characters: 3.o stars<br />Most of the characters are over-the-top in their assigned flawed role (but perhaps that's what makes it such a page-turner): evil mother, obtuse husband, mean high school bullies, depressed 40 year olds...<br /><br />The main character, Camille, raises the character bar though.  She is  a horribly flawed, yet creatively self-destructive woman that truly hates herself - and consistently makes stupid choices to prove it.  And still somehow - you root for her.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: 4.0<br />No matter the rating - this book grips you and won't let you  go- and that's hard to say about many paychological thrillers.
031606792X|5.0|It's true this book wraps up loose endings, but I can't imagine why so many people think that's a bad thing.  It's done over the course of the entire book, not in the last chapter.  I laughed, I cried with happiness.  I read things I'd predicted and many I hadn't.  And then, at the end, I sighed in contentment.<br /><br />The Twilight-reading world would be screaming if we hadn't had details of the wedding, honeymoon, transformation, and Jake's resolution.  We got to see the Denali clan, the Volturi make a nicely threating appearance, and everyone gets a happily ever after.  Is that so bad?<br /><br />As a society we are programmed from middle school to consider anything with a tragic ending \\"literature\\" and anything with a happy ending a trite fairy tale.  I LIKE reading books with happy endings.  Sometimes I'm in the mood to read Doctor Zhivago, but I also appreciate well-written books that don't end tragically.  That's Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />Reviewers are complaining that Stephenie Meyer is encouraging marriage at 18.  Hello?  She spent a great deal of time explaining that, to most people, early marriage is ewwww[...]  She also spent three books leading up to the circumstances that led to the marriage.  Bella and Edward are not typical.  Unlike most 18-year-olds, money is not an issue.  They intended for Bella to continue her education (even if it were going to be delayed) and there was no expectation of pregnancy.  I think it was a POSITIVE message, well argued on both sides.<br /><br />Also, why do people say it's anti-feminist for Bella to choose to keep her baby?  Feminism is about allowing choice and not judging the mother.  We were shown both sides -- Bella's unconditional love for her unborn baby, even at the risk of her own life -- and Edward's anguish and desperation at the thought of it killing her.  If anything, Bella is more assertive in this book than in any of the others.  Edward's always been possessive and protective.  Remember him not allowing her to do things, like seeing her friends at La Push or even just being alone?  He did it for love and because he was protecting her, but no one could say it was feminist.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It's meaty, satisfying, and well-written.her friends at La Push or even just being alone?  He did it for love and because he was protecting her, but no one could say it was feminist.

The black swan idea is quite refreshing but it is revealed completed in the first 20 pages.

B0018O4YSQ|4.0|OK, first things first.  The movie is awesome.  5 stars.  The thing that irritates me, is that the \\"digital copy\\" is Windows Media and works on WINDOWS ONLY.  That's not even the most irritating part about it.  The printed instructions that contain the \\"security key\\" has a picture of a MACBOOK!   Why show a MacBook when the contents in question will absolutely not work on a Mac unless it's running Windows?  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  I used virtualization to get to the files, and there were so many hoops to jump through, it's just retarded.  Upgrade WMP - upgrade security components, etc, etc.  And then the file is limited to your hardware.  If Windows gets fubar, which is not uncommon for Windows, I'm SOL, as I will have already used my ONE TIME ONLY AUTHENTICATION.  Draconian DRM schemes do not deter or prevent piracy.  They simply annoy legitimate customers like me.  Also, if they're going to allow digital copies like this, why Windows only?  How about offering an AppleTV alternative for us Mac users?    OK, bitching out of the way.  Movie rocks, transfer is great, extras are great, Director's cut is cool but it's a completely different movie.
031606792X|5.0|I couldn't be any happier with this book.  I loved everything about it.  I laughed and cried.  I still love the characters and Stephanie has renewed my love for reading.  I thought I would have to give it up after the Harry Potter series was over.  I will read anything she writes.  I am one of those people who love happy endings.  Nothing is more of a waste of my time reading something that has no ending, no closure or the unnecessary need to kill of good characters.  I read to escape and fantisize about something, to use my imagination.  If I want the harsh reality of life I will turn on the evening news.  I got my son into reading the series and he can't wait to start Breaking Dawn.  I highly recommend all the books in this series and can't praise them enough.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Stephanie!

031606792X|5.0|**Spoilers Inside**<br /><br />I highly anticipated this book (probably most people who have posted reviews did as well). The book brought on several emotions for me which I will break down in detail. I will not recount the entire plot of the novel, only key points to make comments on.<br /><br />1. The wedding - the wedding was beautiful and I was glad to see that Bella finally saw her human self as being beautiful. It was nice to see Jacob back, but he did ruin the mood once Bella mentioned the honeymoon and that angered me. The wedding and reception were shorter than I would have like it to be, but there were more important story lines to explore.<br /><br />2. The honeymoon (part 1)- I thought Meyer did a fabulous job of conveying Edward and Bella's intimacy without being smutty. She reinforced the sanctity of marriage before sex which I believe is a fabulous message to young readers.<br /><br />3. The honeymoon (part 2) - I was livid once I realized that Bella was pregnant; and, honestly, it was obvious that Meyer would go in that direction from all of the foreshadowing in Eclipse and in Bella's nightmares. I was horrified that a. Bella wanted to keep the baby and b. she ran to Rosalie for help. I could not refer to the baby as such, instead I deemed it vampire spawn. I felt that Edward was a blubbering idiot during this section and I wanted to smack both him and Bella and tell them to pull it together.<br /><br />4. Jacob's section - I was so extremely angry and frustrated with Bella that Jacob's voice was immediately refreshing. His quips between him and Rosalie kept the mood light when everything else was not. I love that he matured in this section and was not the egotistical idiot that I once deemed him to be. I rooted for him as he took charge and took what was rightfully his - his postion as Alpha. I do admit that the imprintation on Renesmee was a complete and utter shock to me. Given the circumstances it is strange, but it also made complete sense. By incorporating the imprinting on Renesmee into the storyline, it opened up the communication between the wolf packs, allowed for peace to finally come between Jacob and Edward, and created a solid alliance between the wolves and the vampires. As for those who believe that this imprintation promotes pedophilia, I believe that they are misunderstanding the delicate balance and nature of the situation. Yes, Renesmee is just a baby, but no, Jacob is not thinking of her in a romantic or sexual nature. Jacob is first and foremost a guardian and a soulmate. He is not rushing her to grow up, but encouraging her to enjoy her childhood. Jacob will remain a teenager until he decides to give up his shape-shifting ways. Renesmee will become a full grown adult in just seven years and then they can live their happily ever after. For now, he is more a body guard and friend than a lover.<br /><br />5. Bella- Not exactly the transformation she had in mind, but her tranformation took place because it needed to and not only because she wanted it. It was nice to Bella finally believe in herself and not rely on others. I really felt that Nessie and Bella's relationship was not as close of a bond as it should be. I also felt that Edward seemed somewhat detached from Nessie, and not very fatherly. I was relieved that she did not have to hide from Charlie and that he was somewhat in on their secret life, but I couldn't help but think - what about Renee? She is barely mentioned beyond the wedding. Poor Renee. I was, however, extremely excited to finally see Bella hold her own and become a stronger character once she transformed. I thought her power was amazing and for once she was the one who saved the day.<br /><br />6. Renesmee - What an awful name. I get that it's a combination of Renee and Esme, but it's still hideous. I hope that fans do not become inspired to name their daughters after her. I did not want Nessie (a name even worse than Renesmee) to be born. I thought she would be an evilspawn that would destroy the characters I have known and loved. Once she was introduced, I, like the characters in the book, melted. How could you not love her? Yes, the Jacob imprinting was weird, but it gave Jacob a purpose in life and created an improved alliance with the Cullens and a reconciliation with his own pack. She was the key to pulling together the vampire clans to prevent the destructions of the Cullens. I really would like to learn more about her character and to see her grow...a Meyer spin-off perhaps?<br /><br />7. Alice's role- I was aggravated that Alice did not have a voice throughout most of this book. I enjoy Alice's character and thought that she really did not have much purpose in this novel. I was extremely angry when she and Jasper left, but I had a feeling they would be back. Alice quickly redeemed herself in the final chapters, but I still hold a slight grudge.<br /><br />8. The vampire clans - It was extremely interesting to meet the characters that had been mentioned previously but not introduced. With their help, Bella was able to become the strongest weapon in the group - for the first time. I thought the scene with the Volturi would have turned more violent and found myself somewhat disappointed that it did not turn into a showdown, but I was happy with the end result.<br /><br />9. The happily ever after - Yes, this story had a happy ending. Did anyone remember that Stephenie Meyer's favorite author is Jane Austen? Austen was also a firm believer in her characters getting whatever they desired. Meyer's ending was no different. The characters had conflict in all the books, but it was resolved. Any conflict, no matter how large it may seem can be resolved. Yes, everything worked out conveniently well and there is no longer discord. The overwhelming theme was not that you do not have to make choices in life because everything will work out for the best, but rather, love does conquer all. It is a universal theme - with love anything can be and is possible - isn't that a lesson we can all agree on? Instead of a bloody war torn ending, there was a peaceful resolution - we can only dream of this happening more in real life. Yes, everything worked out for our beloved characters. What else was to be expected? This was a fantasy, no, I'm wrong - this was a FAIRY TALE! How could a reader not expect all the pieces of the puzzle to fit together when all along it seemed like a fairy tale - the knight in shining armor, the damsel in distress, the evil Volturi...(Meyer makes several allusions to literary fairy tales). Readers need to remember that this is not a work of nonfiction. It is not a work of realistic fiction. It is a fairy tale and everyone got their happily ever after.<br /><br />10.

0743298039|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but reading through the reviews I found some common threads among those who didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I. Here are those common threads and my thoughts on them, to help you decide if this book is for you.<br /><br />- Based upon some very good reviews, many expected this debut novel to be the next 'Jane Eyre' (or another one of their classic favorites - so nothing could compete)<br />- They wanted a fast-paced page-turner mystery (and this book, though engaging is not that).<br />- The saga of a dysfunctional family in a mansion was not what they expected (or wanted)<br />- It took too many words to say too little to many - and the beginning was slow.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1. The prose in this book is 5-star worthy.  Setterfield does know how to write!<br />2. The book reminded me throughout of some of my favorite childhood books  - [[ASIN:0689831412 The Secret Garden (Aladdin Classics)]] and [[ASIN:1416510885 Flowers in the Attic (Dollanganger)]] - but now written for adults.  Negative reviewers often said the same thing - they just didn't particularly like those books.<br />3. The pace of this book is slower - doled out over meetings between the two protagonists. It is not an \\"I can't put this down\\" type book.  It is, however, an \\"I'm looking forward to the next time I can pick it up\\" type book.<br />4. You can't help but not like, the main character, Lea and the biographer and the custodian of stories.She's a fellow book lover, as she says \\"As one tends the graves of the dead, so I tend books....Do they sense it these dead writers when their books are read? Is their soul touched ... by another mind reading theirs.  I do hope so.\\"<br />5. The story is engaging, the premise is different and while a long book --- it spans over 120 years of unique family history and several plots--- it's done well so each chapter is often a nice tale within itself, but with bigger questions still to be answered.<br />6. It does start out particularly slowly --- allow yourself the first 50 pages or so to ease into this book like you would a warm bath, before you write it off.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Is this book for you? If you're expecting a good read about interesting characters and liked V.C. Andrews as a child - then you'll probably enjoy this one.  If you're expecting a fast-paced page turning mystery instead of the interesting story of Vida Winter and how she came to be who she was and the relationships she had, then you'd best look elsewhere.so to ease into this book like you would a warm bath, before you write it off.

031606792X|5.0|This book in the beginning was what I expected. Then what I love was the twist. The twist gave Bella the feeling of not just first love, but first love for a unexpected permenant visitor.     I love how Jacob does this for Bella, Jacob must love her so much. Edward gives and caves so easy Hah!    Go team Switzerland. I love the name for all the covens.      Alice plans such a great............future.  Stephenie Meyer You could not have ended it a bit better!!!!  I still wonder what exactley does the cover mean?      GO STEPHENIE!!!!!
B000WGWQG8|1.0|The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as \\"fact\\" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old \\"You Are There\\" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the \\"small\\" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted \\"Fire\\" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!  Oh well, that's modern film-making for you -- where directors and writers confuse their own aspirations for social change and \\"influencing the masses\\" with authentic telling of history.  Advice: stick to authenticdocumentaries, and keep fresh batteries in your BS detector.
031606792X|3.0|This book is so different from the other three it's hard to believe they are part of the same series. As a stand alone novel, this one is interesting and entertaining. As a conclusion to the Twilight saga, it is sadly lacking. The character realism we have come to expect from Meyer is not there. In the other books there was never a moment when a character spoke and you thought \\"Yeah, right.\\" This book felt like nothing but those moments.  The structure of the novel was different as well, and while the idea of hearing from different \\"voices\\" in the same novel is cool, again it doesn't fit with the other books and there seems to be absolutely no reason for it.  I am 23 years old and I have a daughter who is eight months old. I got married at ninteen. I graduated from college and plan to go back for a PhD later in my life. I am an artist. I absolutely love my life and would not do anything differently. That said, I think that Meyer's version of Bella's \\"perfect\\" life is dangerously unrealistic for young people who don't know what part of this is emotionally believable (Bella and Edward's love) and what isn't (the entire rest of the book).   I can't help but think Meyer's religious preferences and personal limitations got in the way of Bella becoming a fully developed character.
031606792X|3.0|***SPOILERS***    \\"The girl was a classic martyr.\\"- Jacob Black    These words, spoken by the only person who seemed to have any sense whatsoever in \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" pretty much sum up this book for me. I could deal with Bella's whining in \\"Twilight\\" because it was such a good book. I gave her some slack in \\"New Moon\\" because she had just lost her first love. She began to annoy me in \\"Eclipse.\\" But \\"Breaking Dawn\\". . . . Bella reached a whole new level of whiny, pitiful female. Like Jacob says, Bella is \\"a classic martyr\\"; she would die for Edward, but it never seemed romantic. Her love just seemed like a sick obsession gone terribly wrong. It's really unfortunate that Jacob had to imprint on Nessie because he was the only person with any sense in this book. I enjoyed his narrative the most by far, & I found it beyond creepy for him to imprint on Bella's daughter, especially given the age difference at the time.     Bella's pregnancy was possibly the worst plot point Meyer could have come up with, & I agree with other reviewers who have said that this story ended just a little too happily ever after. Take a page from J. K. Rowling, & stick some reality in this book. Sure, it is sad for characters to die, but it is worse to wrap things up so neatly. However, the book is not without its strengths. In the last few chapters, Bella faces death & plots to save Renesmee & Jacob, which is touching. She seems to have grown somewhat.     More than ever, I see these books as sexist & promoting the idea that you must be in a relationship to be happy. If you are looking for a good YA story with a strong, young woman, I would recommend Libba Bray's trilogy that begins with \\"A Great & Terrible Beauty.\\" That series is miles above this one & deserves the attention & sales that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" has gotten.
031606792X|2.0|So, one day earlier this week, I came across a spoiler page, and I, like many others awaiting the arrival of this oh-so-lovely book, could simply not resist clicking on it.     After reading the promised spoiler (and breaking my pact with my friends to avoid such temptations), I realized I was wasting my time. I wasn't about to believe that Edward knocked Bella up with some supernatural vampire baby who, when introduced into the world after only a few weeks in mommy's tummy, becomes the girl who Jacob is destined to be with. Forever. (And forever and forever..right Edward?)     I remember thinking, next time when you are revealing 'spoilers', try not to sound so much like a bad fanfiction story. Stephenie Meyer would never do that to us.    Imagine my surprise when I found that she, indeed, did.    Now, don't get me wrong, there were good parts to Breaking Dawn, the best probably being the part in Jacob's point of view. His dark and sarcastic humor was a nice break from Bella's general dramatics and frequent praises of Edward's perfection.     But there were many, many more bad parts to the story.    To me, Nessie seemed like the easy way out. It provided a gasp-worthy (main) plot line for the highly anticipated fourth book in the Twlight Saga, and was a way to remove Jacob from the love triangle so everyone could get their happily ever after. And in a sick way, they did. Like some Disney fairytale. This, in my opinion, was the weakest part (so I guess that means most of the book is weak), and proved to be more disappointing than I expected.     And then there were the many muddled messages that this book contained, or lack thereof. Bella is pretty much portrayed as this helpless female who goes from being an average high school student to a young wife and then a teenage mother. What kind of message is this giving the many teenage girls that flock to this book? I was hoping Stephenie Meyer would let Bella be independent for once, but again, yet another disappointment.    And the greatest disappointment of all, where were the shared themes? They all seem to be shattered in this book, and it doesn't really seem like the saga is connected at all.     So my advice is, if you haven't read Breaking Dawn yet, don't. It pretty much destroys the epic-ness of the first three, and makes the entire saga seem like nothing more than just another romance
031606792X|5.0|This book was the best of the four. I'm not sure why it got such crappy reviews, cause I sure loved it!    The biggest complaint was that Meyer didn't send a good message to young girls. I don't know about everyone else, but I'm not taking advice from a fantasy novel. After reading this book, I didn't say, \\"Ok, I think I'm going to get married and have a kid. I mean come on, Bella and Edward did it at 18, so I guess I can do it at 13, right?\\"  Please! Who thinks like that?     Anyhoo, the book starts out with Bella and Edward's wedding only being a few days away. Bella is self-conscious about the new car that Edward is insisting she drive until she is changed to a vampire. It's supposed to be so safe that a tank could roll over it, and it wouldn't be damaged. Since Bella is accident-pron, this is a must.  The book then quickly jumps to Bella and Edward telling Bella's father about their engagement. He overreacts, thinking that Bella is pregnant. She isn't, yet. She does discovers she is on their honeymoon, after her period is five days late, and she's craving scrambled eggs by the carton.    There was a couple of gross parts in the book, like when Bella has to drink blood to keep the baby from killing her. I don't think I'll ever be able to drink anything red again.    Over all, I thought this book was the best I've ever read. I started reading this series about a month ago, and I was hooked. I've never liked vampires, but the ones in these books I love.    If you love the Twilight Saga, read this book!
0307388840|3.0|I normally have a 100 page limit on a book where if it doesn't pick up by then, I would put it down and consider it a lost cause. This book is really tedious in the beginning ... lots of flowery words and it just wasn't getting anywhere. Frankly, it was just boring. It finally picked up when Robbie, the accused, was marching home from a battle ... till the end. I have to admit, I never felt drawn to the characters at all in this book. I thought it was a superficial book, written in a way that you keep thinking it's a movie, peopled by people who just aren't real.     I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know how good that is. I figured out who was the antagonist early on. I figured out why Briony blamed Robbie for the crime and I figured out the ending long before it arrived. The saving grace of this novel is the World War II scenes and the nursing scenes that Briony described. I love history and that little bits of it really saved this book for me.     If you like books where people put on affected airs, you'll love this book. If you like writing that is long-winded and trying to be flowery and lyrical, this book is for you. Don't try to read this book when you're in a bad mood, because it will keep you grumpy (that is probably my problem). If you have the time to sit and read a book like this, I highly recommend it. If you're a busy mom like me, no, this book won't do. It just didn't move fast enough for me to savor.     8/3/08
B0016AJU2C|4.0|Alanis' new album shows that she's still capeable of writing great songs that you will return to many times. In fact, at least half of the album ranks with the very best she has recorded throughout her career. The strongest songs are those with sparse, almost fragile arrangements like the melancholy but beautiful \\"Not as We\\" and \\"Torch\\".<br /><br />The first single \\"Underneath\\" is classic catchy Alanis, and another favourite.<br /><br />\\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\" has an unusual arrangement for Alanis with oriental inspired strings but the songs works really well.<br /><br />Some songs though have been given too much techno sound and come out somewhat overproduced.<br /><br />The closing track \\"Incomplete\\" is a catchy waltzy tune, and fine end to an album that has its ups and downs - mostly ups.<br /><br />The bonus CD contains 5 songs and it's wonder to me why a fine song like \\"Orchid\\" was left out of the original album.  A quiet acoustic melodic song. Also the piano accompanied \\"Madness\\" is a solid addition.
031606792X|5.0|The book was better than what I thought it was going to be.  After seeing spoilers about the book I was upset but once I read it myself it pulled together nicely.  I do think Bella and Edward could have enjoyed their honeymoon longer.  The whole pregnancy thing came out of left field.  I would've preferred to see just the two of them for awhile.  But in the end I am pleased and satisfied with the series.  I have sense of closure.  Now maybe I won't be so obsessed and can read another series.    Thank you Stephanie for a very enjoyable saga!!    Twilight Moms Rock! As does Edward!
B000000ZGO|5.0|This is a classic cd. Years ago this was my first album by Mr. Hayes.  It is a pleasure to have it in CD format. The music has wonderful orchestration as well as the great brass section not to mention how he tells the stories in his remakes of other songs.  I highly recommend this cd.

031606792X|2.0|I have been a big fan of the first three books.  That made Breaking Dawn even more of a let down.    I will put no spoilers in this review.  If I could, it would be much harsher!  But here are my likes and dislikes.    LIKES:    1) I liked the section from Jacob's POV.  I can't say I like the plot in those chapters, but I did like his narration, and the voice there.    2) TEAM SETH.  He is by far the most redeeming character in this whole mess.  Possibly the only one.    3) Descriptions from Bella's point of view after a certain turn of events.  Meyer gives us a good look at things through her eyes at a pivotal turning point in the series.    4) Meyer brings a bunch of characters from the series all together for her climax, and the mix is interesting.    DISLIKES:    1) The first seven chapters not only feel rushed, but are also absolutely CHEESY!    2) The name of the new character - you KNOW who I'm talking about if you read it.  What?!    3) What Jacob does that wraps up his fate.  Is this supposed to be some consolation for Team Jacob?  It's more like torture...    4) There are graphic medical scenes, to put it lightly without spoiling it.  If you have a weak stomach, watch out.  I had to stop reading and put my head between my knees!    5) The overall plot.  Meyer ignores many of the very rules she has set for the world she has created, finding loopholes for her story.  It's almost as if she just thought, \\"What is the most random story line I can put together?\\" and then somehow tried to make that work with the existing series.    6)  This book just doesn't match with the first three at all!  All the characters act different.  Completely.  It's as if someone else wrote it, without reading the first 3 books.    7) Without spoiling, I will just say that some of the things highly anticipated by fans for this book are a let down.  Things that you assume happen in the book do, but the outcome is anti-climactic.    8) It was all too easy how things were worked out with Charlie.  All too perfect.    9) Just when you start to like Jacob, something happens that causes him to act stupid for the rest of the book.    10) I just hate the very plot point that causes all the action here.  What they fight over.  It seems silly and contradicts what the characters would have done in the other books.  Bella feels an attachment to this thing, but the reader doesn't.    11) The ending picks up right where it started - PURE CHEESEY.  I just can't say this enough!  Everything wraps up TOO perfectly.  It's the opposite of an author killing off characters just for drama's sake.  Meyer doesn't make her characters sarafice anything!    The whole point of a lot of this series is about choice.  The characters have to choose to give up certain things to gain others.  I think we all want a happy ending, but the way Meyer achives it is so cheesy and rediculous I think we all are left, not satisfied, but jipped.  Nothing is this easy.      It's too bad.  I think we all really wanted to like this book.  Maybe someone will write some great fanfic.
031606792X|3.0|I'm a huge Meyer fan - I tend to devour everything she writes so quickly for plot that I have to go back and read it again just for detail.  This book - the one I waited for with the most anticipation - didn't totally do it for me.  I just couldn't get totally excited by it.      **spoilers**    The Problems - I have a problem with the whole pregnancy thing.  There's suspending disbelief, and then there's just WHAT?? moments.  The pregnancy was of the latter variety.  That whole story line was weird.  And how are we really supposed to feel about Rosalie?  She sees Bella as a vessel, but then she's totally fine relinquishing the baby to her later?  And did it HAVE to be called Renesme?  I tripped over that every time I read it.  I wanted Jake to have a happy ending...I was even hoping maybe he would get his own book to resolve his issues...but it was too tidy for him to imprint on the baby.  In all the other books, I identified with the characters.  I FELT them.  I felt adrift in this one.      The Good Stuff - I loved the story up through the pregnancy.  The wedding, the honeymoon...all of it was great.  I loved some of the personal interaction between Bella and Edward at the cottage too.  That intensity was nice.  I even like the portion from Jake's point of view, but it did prevent you from identifying with Bella throughout the book.  I think Jake should have had his own story.    Meyer's writing can be moving.  In the Twilight series and in The Host she does a great job of emoting.  You feel the characters' angst, you struggle with the same decisions they struggle with, you feel their pain and their elation.  The books are like an emotional rollercoaster that drain you completely when you get off, but you run to get back in line for.  This one just didn't have that spark, that emotional draw.  It's too bad, but I'm sure it's an aberation.  I definitely won't stop reading her writing.
031606792X|5.0|Listen up! If you read Mrs Meyers other books and loved them, then you need to read this one before you listen to any other little kids on here that is saying that they hated it.     This book was amazing and I think that it ended PERFECTLY for Edward and Bella. People need to stop trying to find the \\"hidden messages\\" in this book. It DOES NOT teach kids to get pregnant young and it IS NOT a book about Pedophiles! For the people who said that line over and over, you obviously did not read the book or the other book's before this one very well.     I have read so many stupid reviews that are shooting this novel down and I am really angry that people are trying to ruin it. This is a great book and it is the perfect ending for the chracters in it, but I will warn you that if you don't like a happy ending, there are a lot of people on here that don't, then don't read it! Cause it is extremely happy! :D
B00007KWHG|4.0|Recently had the pleasure of seeing \\"Jersey Boys\\" on Broadway and left the theater remembering all of the songs of The Four Seasons which brought back so many memories of yesteryear and my coming of age.  This CD has most of the hits.  One of my favorites, \\"Silence is Golden\\" is not on here and very difficult to find but I enjoyed the songs which are featured.
031606792X|5.0|To all those readers that thought Breaking Dawn was terrible, I truly believe you would have said the same thing if Breaking Dawn had been twisted, complicated, and gut wrenching!  I personally thought Stephenie did a fabulous job ending the series in a way that those of us who truly love the characters can be satisfied with.  It was nothing that I expected, but everything I didn't know I wanted for Bella, Edward, and Jacob.  I know a lot of readers think it was terrible that everyone should be happy in the end and that no one really had to suffer a great deal of loss, but sometimes life really is good and things really do end up working out for the best for everyone.  I can sleep at night knowing that, somewhere in their fantasy world, Bella and Edward are happy and safe.  I thought it was just perfect.
031606792X|5.0|As it seems this is going to be an unpopular opinion, I will be more than happy to add my thoughts to the ending of the Twilight Saga.  I. Liked. It.    And I'm not even a squealing teenage fan girl.  Spoilers will follow herein, but if you didn't want to be spoiled, what are you doing online, right?    Many will criticize both the author and the characters for the whole marriage at 18 subplot.  However, I find it VERY interesting.  Both Edward and Bella are old souls.  The characters of Bella and Edward explain their points of view on the early marriage in Eclipse.  Edward, having been raised in a time where this was not only natural, but expected, explains his reasoning for early marriage.  As for Bella, her thoughts on marriage are, as she admits, based on her 17 years of being raised by her mom.  She had similar pre-concieved notions about Forks (again due to her mom's influence), that once she allowed herself to develop her own opinion, she found that she was very comfortable with marrying early.  If you believe in the depth of love they feel for each other, it's not hard to see why they would marry \\"young.\\"    As much as people will put Bella at being selfish, I *do* see her sacrifices.  Does she get something out of each of them?  Yes.  And perhaps more than a person would get realistically.  But many fans seem to have forgotten this is fantasy, a romantic fantasy.  And the fact that this book, while not a children's book, is classified as a Young Adult book.  So no, we aren't going to read more graphic scenes than what is written.    I will fully admit that the pregnancy subplot caught me a bit off guard, but again, I liked it.  The love of family is a VERY important theme in this book.    Most readers suspected that the Volturi would be involved, and that they would be coming back for the Cullens.  Edward admitted as much in Eclipse.  They weren't going to be satisfied with Bella's transformation.  But had that been all there was involved, there would not have been such a powerful book.  Disappointed readers would be typing their irate thoughts about the lack of depth.    May I suggest to that the fans that are disappointed, go back to the beginning and start at Twilight.  Feel the build up and see the clues that were there for us all along.  Remember, New Moon \\"sucked\\" in the beginning too, but brought around a powerful, bring-you-to-your-knees climax.
031606792X|5.0|I personally thought the book was really good. The story did take a whole new twist, but it was a good twist. I know that everything at the end seemed perfect, but why shouldn't it. This book was not written to give a lesson, but more for enjoyment.
B0017I1FP8|1.0|I have to disagree with all of the 5-star reviews out there.  This is not a fantastic score.  It cannot stand on its own outside of the movie.    It sets the mood, it sets the pace, but there is hardly anything listenable in it by itself.  Tones, beats, but hardly anything palletable without the onscreen action.    I loved the movie.  I loved the sound of the movie, but this score will fade after the basic theme of Batman is played.  It's boring and shapeless.    One star.
031606792X|4.0|I just finished reading Breaking dawn last night. I do not understand why everyone is getting so upset. This was SM book and she ended it they way she saw fit. Yes the hole baby thing got a little carried away, and I did not feel the same spark between Edward and Bella that I did it Twilight. But this is not Twilight and there will never be a book as good as Twilight. This just gives us a nice happy ending. I am sad to let the characters go, and I do hope she writes more books about the Cullen family. Now she needs to write The Soul and Midnight Sun. Give the book a chance guys, it is not so bad.
031606792X|1.0|I was anxious to read the fourth edition but much to my disappointment. The storyline seemed dragged out then as if she rushed to write the ending. She lost her touch to the series or maybe was just done with writing novels for teens. It was as if she was preoccupied with writing The Host.
031606792X|2.0|I just finished rereading the first 3 last week and I said to my husband \\"I forgot how good these books are!\\"    After just finishing reading Breaking Dawn I feel let down and disappointed. I had so many issues I can't even begin to address them.     My #1 issue is that if you want to have a happy ending that is completely fine go right ahead...BUT the happy endings aren't believable without some sacrifice. At least JK had some balls to kill of major characters to get us to Harry's happy ending.     Sorry - Stephenie, I feel bad writing this after loving your 1st three so much but this book was just so disjointed and left me feeling sad and confused.
031606792X|1.0|After reading the honeymoon, I was almost completly sure that this wasn't the actual book. Myself and my sister were in shock that we were reading this awful epic failure of an awful fan fiction. After reading further my eyes bulged out of my head and my mouth hung open and I just couldn't understand how the author could \\"assasinate\\" her own characters that way. Is \\"this\\" the Breaking Dawn that we were waiting for?!!? Or did some crazed fan sneak their awful fan fiction in a the printers?!?
031606792X|1.0|There is a scene in the movie \\"Wonder Boys\\" (yes, this is relevant) where Katie Holmes character accuses a writer of refusing to make any choices in his novel, which is bigger than a phone book. I feel that this is the problem with \\"Breaking Dawn\\".     I think Meyers, like a mother who wants to give her children the world, tried to give her fans everything they wanted plot-wise, and instead of choosing one or two major events she chose several that made the book seem overcrowded, overworked, and overwhelming.      The major flaw in this book is the character of Nessie. Her creation not only creates a rift in the mythology of the book but also creates a rift in Bella and Edward's perfect love scenario.     I would have been happy with the book ending after the first week of the honeymoon.      Also, to Ms. Meyers (if she reads her reviews): I am so sorry about writing this but it is my honest opinion.
031606792X|5.0|OMG OMG OMG is all i can say about the 4th and final book.  I got it at midnight release and read as soon as I go it.  I finished it in about a day and 1/2, i just couldn't put it down.  I think Stephanie Meyer is an AWESOME  writer, reading her books is like watching a movie inside your head while your reading.  I hated to see it end but I'm sure that I will read these books hundreds of times before I could ever get tired of them.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking dawn was nothing I had expected. I was awed and shocked through the first half. It was an amazing ride with unbelievable twists and turns. I cried at the end knowing it was the end of Bella's story. The book was awesome.
031606792X|1.0|It took me a while to convince myself that this really is the real Breaking Dawn. I wasn't expecting a brilliant work of literature, of course. Not when it came to Stephenie Meyer, anyway. But this book is so bad beyond words, even for her.    Though I must say, finally! I've been wishing for the day to arrive when those die-hard Twilight fans would realize how bad these books really are. With the fourth, and fortunately last, book  of the series out, my wish has come true. Even the most loyal worshippers of Stephenie Meyer can't deny the epic failure that is Breaking Dawn. The worst part was that I couldn't put the book down. Not because it was good, certainly not. The only logical reason I could come up with to explain my need to keep reading is that I must be some masochistic freak, because there is absolutely no redeeming quality for this terrible excuse for literature.
031606792X|1.0|My complaints have already been repeated ad nauseam, so I will say only this:    If I wake up after my wedding night and am covered in feathers and bruises, I am SO getting a divorce.
031606792X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I felt there was closure for Bella. I have read all the books several times and I can't wait to read more from SM!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I cannot understand what all these people are moaning about. The book is darker and more sophisticated than any of the prior books in the series...and moral ambiguities abound .At the same time, the story is compelling, exciting and romantic in the most satisfying and pure sense. How I wish this story would continue!
031606792X|1.0|I was so excited last night when I finally had this book in my hands.  I loved the first three books in the series so much and I couldn't wait to see how it would end.  But now that I have finished reading it, all I feel is HUGE disappointment!!!!  It was not at all what I would have expected it to be.  I didn't feel any of the magic I felt with the first three books.  I just want to go pretend that I never read this book now!
031606792X|5.0|I must admit that at first I was not thrilled with this book, but now I love it. Honestly I can't see why people are complaining.   *Spoilers*  Yes Bella gets pregnant, but she's married for crying out loud, how is that a bad message? And when she's willing to sacrifice herself for her child, what mother wouldn't do that? People complaining about that must be souless or something. What's wrong with everyone ending up happy? Not everyone is bitter like some people are. I thought the book is great and maybe people just lack sympathy or empathy or some other key factor to a good psycological make up. Bella's talent isn't dumb either. It's perfect for her, protecting the people she loves, how Bella is that?   Jacob's imprinting isn't bad either. Unexpected, completely, but if Bella and Edward are fine with it, everyone else should be too. Also I loved the chapter titles in Jake's book. They were hilarious.  All in all this was a great book and a better ending. Don't listen to the bitter reviewers.
031606792X|1.0|I've read the previous books and was excited to read this book as well. I guess when you find yourself engrossed in something you find a personally clear definition of how things should end, often drawing from the perimeters set by the author.     I am very disappointed with this book and a little sad that Stephenie Meyer decided to taint such a good series with a \\"And they lived happily ever after to the end of their days\\" instead of just them being together, sans fairytale ending. Twilight struck me as a very honest and endearing book and followed with two similarly written books. Breaking dawn seemed very forced, like she was trying too hard, to create something that fit the genre of young adult horror instead of just writing. I will probably only ever read this book once and recommend someone reading the series to read it. But with a warning label: Only read it for the sake of the series, not because you will enjoy how well it ends.
B0018SRV3W|4.0|This movie was great. there are a lot of interested scenes come out and the love between two couples, that was good. The movie computer graphic design was excellent. The movie view was fantastic. I interested this movie.
0743554450|5.0|Just like with \\"The Kite Runner\\", for me, this book was great to listen to.  I really like books on CD, so that I can listen to them in the car or while doing other things.  Having the author read the book is not always a good idea.  Just like having the writer of a screenplay playing the lead roll in a movie, it just doesn't always work out.  In this case, it works very well.  The author is able to say the names of people, cities, etc. correctly and that's very important with a book such as this.  I was so glad I had the book on CD and not in paper form, because having a lot of \\"unusual\\" names to read gets a little aggravating for me.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns did not disappoint.  Having read (listened to) The Kite Runner, I was very anxious for the release of A Thousand Splendid Suns.  Sometimes a follow-up can be a disappointment because the writing is simply not as good. . . or it's \\"over-hyped\\".. . . or your expectations are simply too high.  That's not the case here.<br /><br />With our men and women in uniform deployed to Afghanistan, I also feel that this book, along with The Kite Runner, is \\"required reading\\" for all Americans who want to have a better understanding of what Afghan's have gone through.  Your heart goes out to the people of Afghanistan, but especially the women of Afghanistan.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0743545230 The Kite Runner]]
031606792X|4.0|*Spoilers ahead*    I enjoyed this book as the end of a remarkable series, but can see how some fans were disappointed.  The first three books were incredibly romantic, and BD has a much more violent and dark tone.  As another reviewer mentioned, it was similar to Harry Potter 7 in this sense.  Those early books had a lot of magic and whimsy, and then the last couple of books have the young wizards and witches dealing with wars and death- they become much more serious.  BD is very similar.  *Please note that I am NOT trying to say that the \\"Twilight\\" series really compares to the \\"Harry Potter\\" series; Harry Potter was truly unique.    I kind of got the sense that SM was just pulling out all the stops and going out with a bang.  A lot goes on and there were definite moments when I did not know how it would all turn out for Edward and Bella- since the wedding took place early, I was afraid there was a dark end for one or both of them.    While I did not care for her using Jacob's point of view in part of this book (he is my least favorite character so perhaps I am prejudice) and I also did not care for the pregnancy element (I agree with another reviewer that I preferred thinking it was just going to be Bella and Edward for all eternity and that's all they needed), I guess she was just trying to come up with some \\"new\\" plot-lines.   Edward and Bella already had their happily ever after in \\"Twilight\\" in the sense that they are soul mates destined to always be together; there has already been the back and forth over whether or not Bella should become a vampire- there had to be some kind of \\"new\\" conflict.    I guess ultimately I would have to say that for all the romantics and \\"Team Edward\\" people out there, you will not be disappointed.  While I am not in love with this book, like I am with \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Eclipse\\", I was satisfied by the ending.
031606792X|5.0|Let me first say that I understand why so many are so critical of this book. I myself was frustrated by an entire book dedicated to Jacob (Book 2 within Breaking Dawn), but as it progressed I understood why it was necessary, and as the story progressed even further, I understood every piece of the story, and why it was necessary. I was absolutely satisfied. I loved that Jake imprinted on Renesmee, because in some ways he got what he always wanted, and it was almost like a forgiveness that spread through me for eclipse and new moon and how he annoyed me so when I loved Bells and Edward so much together because I finally understood why he was so intent on her. I know he loved her, but it was as if he was there to love her first to get to Renesmee. It was completely beautiful. I know Stephenie was a little worried about taking away Bells mortality, and I was begging her to. I was a little shaky about the whole hurting bells while being pregnant and her power that seemed, at first to be too insignificant for the character of Bella that Steph had created, but the ending reassured me that it was best, that Bells didnt need anything else, because she was a simple girl, the girl we came to know and love, she was Bella, and she was introduced as a completely ordinary girl, and of course we knew better that that, but through her eyes and who she was reflected her power greatly, perfectly, and when i think about it, the story was nearly perfect. No, it WAS PERFECT! Through this book, i now understand the reason behind the others, i can now read them in peace without getting upset when Bella says she loves Jake or something because I know how she feels about Edward and how he feels about her and how the story ends. I know that it was all for a reason, and that makes me happy. I actually found myself liking Jake through all of his blonde jokes. I understood his character more when he wasnt fawning over Bells, and let Edward and her have their space. It was great. Introducing thebaby was a little shaky i will definitely admit but she was so sweet, and she brought a sense of unity to the story between Rosalie and Bella, that was unbreakable, and very admirable.   Re-read the book if you think otherwise. I AM TEAM EDWARD ALL THE WAY, and now I like Jake too, which I thought was impossible after Eclipse in particular, and New Moon in partial. I absolutely LOVE THIS BOOK, AND HAVE DEEP ADMIRATION FOR STEPHENIE MEYER, WHEN I READ TWILIGHT I DECLARED IT WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER, now after reading the series and desperatley anticipating Midnight Sun, I can now call STEPHENIE MEYER, MY FAVORITE AUTHOR OF ALL TIME.    I'm not ready for this to end with Midnight sun, one more book to show how Edward and Bella's life progresses and how Jake and Renesmee do would be BLISS. I will take what I can get.
B0018D4SHY|4.0|Fifty-plus years after budding blues singer Richard Penniman transformed himself into the prototype wild man rock `n' roller Little Richard, these seminal sides on Specialty retain every bit of their invention and abandon. Recorded in New Orleans with the rock 'n' roll pillars of Earl Palmer's second-line drumming and Lee Allen's muscular, swinging saxophone, Little Richard's best singles are as good as any rock 'n' roll records ever recorded. His outlandishly raw and seductive vocals stretched the microphones to their limits, just as his hammering on the piano often threatened to shake his instrument apart.<br /><br />The hits are radioactive elements of the rock 'n' roll lexicon, their radiance undimmed by fifty years of tribute, imitation and repetition. Starting with 1955's \\"Tutti Frutti\\" Richard waxed a string of scorching sides that included \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly,\\" \\"Rip It Up,\\" and \\"Ready Teddy,\\" each invested with a level of vocal exuberance unmatched by his contemporaries. Even when he'd take a breath and drop the key below the top-edge of his range, as on the mid-tempo \\"Slipin' and Slidin' (Peepin' and Hidin'),\\" his voice remained edgy, and his instrumental battles with Lee Allen reaped brilliant rewards. Richard wrote or chose songs whose themes matched the newly acquired independence felt by mid-50s teens. Even with the lyrics tidied up here and there, the sexuality was hard to miss, and coupled with the brazenness of Richard's vocals (and Lee Allen's sax), it's easy to see how rock 'n' roll menaced 1950s Eisenhower America.<br /><br />Even with all this inventiveness, as early as 1956 some of Richard's singles began to sound repetitive. \\"Heeby Jeeby\\" and \\"She's Got It,\\" for example, borrowed liberally from their predecessors. Later in the year, Richard's label head, Art Rupe, maneuvered him into the title song of \\"The Girl Can't Help It,\\" written by Bobby Troup. The production retains the New Orleans phrasings and edgy vocals of Richard's earlier sides, but adds stagey background singers. Richard still had plenty of thrills in him, however, laying down \\"Lucille\\" and \\"Jenny Jenny\\" to fill out the year. In between he dropped the Lloyd Price styled ballad \\"Send Me Some Lovin,\\" penned by Price's brother, adding dynamics to accommodate a bluesier tune.<br /><br />The rock 'n' roll blast furnace was stoked again in 1957 with the raucous \\"Keep A-Knockin',\\" but shortly thereafter Richard quit the business to attend bible college. His vacillation between preaching and rocking (that is, the sacred and the profane) prompted Specialty to issue older sides as new singles in 1957, charting his last U.S. hits with 1955's \\"True Fine Mama\\" and 1956's \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly.\\" A pair of tin pan alley standards, \\"Baby Face\\" and \\"By the Light of the Silvery Moon,\\" hit the U.K. top-20 in 1959, but it wasn't until he returned to touring in 1962, and found fans in the Beatles, that he once again placed himself on the U.K. chart with 1964's \\"Bama Lama Lou.\\" Filling out the CD are surprisingly sedate covers of Leiber & Stoller's \\"Kansas City,\\" and one of Richard's original Specialty audition demos, the blues \\"Baby.\\" Closing the disc is a live medley from 1964 that gives listeners a sense of Richard's commanding performance, even as his band played more soulful than New Orleans raw.<br /><br />This set's extras are interesting, but don't compare to the visceral brilliance of the singles, all of which have been available on numerous vinyl and CD collections over the years. Specialty's 1991 release for example, \\"The Georgia Peach,\\" offers the same hits with a different selection of bonuses, and Great Voices of the Century's \\"Rip it Up: The Hits and More 1951-1957\\" offers a broader view that includes sides from RCA and Peacock alongside the requisite Specialty recordings.  This latest set comes in a tri-fold digipack featuring excellent full-panel photos and an insert booklet with more photos and liner notes by Billy Vera.This is a terrific one-disc shop for those who want a focused introduction to Little Richard's best-loved Specialty sides. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

031606792X|1.0|I discovered Meyer's Twilight Saga only two weeks before the release of \\"Breaking Dawn\\". Though books 1-3 aren't entirely flawless I still was very impressed with the rich characters she portrayed and truly could not wait to see the story continue onward. Oh happy day when I found out there would be a fourth installment and only a short time to wait.<br />Well the joke was on us. Who wrote this? Clearly it wasn't SM, I couldn't hear her voice in this book at all. What happened to the characters, lobotomies? I felt,(and I'm sure some will disagree)that Jacob was the only one to stay true to his nature, his character. (Yeah, even though it was the worst imprinting choice ever it still rang true to the way he would be, how he would interact with her.... okay you win, still gross.)<br />Why the rush SM? Pressure from the publishers to wrap up this story now when it clearly should have been spread out over a few more books? You did a disservice to us all.<br />As it has been stated here, not to mention often, it would be the best idea to never read this, let it end at \\"Eclipse\\", it's not like it's the first book to ever end with a question mark. I only say this because you can't unread \\"Breaking Dawn\\", you can't erase it from your mind. I say let this one go and save yourself some heartache.<br /><br />A note to Amazon:<br />You are going to lose out on Kindle book sales if you repeat what you did with this book.  Because you pushed the release back a day (maybe it was out of your hands), I had to make a mad dash to hell (Walmart) to buy the hardcover. I'm certain I wasn't the only one who was affected by this BS.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn surprised me a little too when I read of Bella's thirst for sex and the young pregnancy BUT come on people!! This is what everyone has been waiting for!! Presented with the most beautiful creature in existence that I was deeply in love with AND married to, I would lust for him above anything else too. People are mad at an 18 year old became pregnant as if the two were not married first. The age for marriage is 18 (in Washington) GET OVER IT PEOPLE. THERE ARE MATURE 18 YEAR OLDS WHO CAN MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN. Thats my next problem -- I am reading reviews that Meyer promotes teen pregnancy. Are you serious? Bella is 18 and married, go find another battle to fight, this was a legitimate and MUCH anticipated part of this book and I applaud Meyer for writing it so well. Jacob imprinting Renesmee was of course weird, but if you people READ CAREFULLY, they have no control of imprinting so let go of the creepiness factor that Renesmee is only a baby. It is known that at this point in time, he only wants her to be happy and in no way is there a creepiness factor in that kind of love. The name Renesmee is also getting bad reviews but I think it is beautiful and original and contrary to some dummies out there, not hard to pronounce. \\"Nessie\\" is annoying, but so are many nick names -- Do little trivial parts like this really make Breaking Dawn get this many negative reviews?? Its a shame.  I feel like people are finding the dumbest reasons for picking apart this book. I did nothing but read all weekend and still found the same elation and wide grins that I had when reading Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse. Never have I read a series so compelling or loved a fictional story so much. This book closed every loose end and made my reading all the previous books much worth while. I LOVE Breaking Dawn and you idiots who dont obviously were not as taken with the series as the hundreds of thousands of us were.  The only disappointment of mine was finishing the book and having to start all over again :)  LOVE IT.
031606792X|5.0|I know a lot of people are upset with Breaking Dawn. I am a dedicated Meyer fan myself and when I read all the negative reviews and comments people were posting I was shocked. Not because they were inappropriate, but because who are we to judge her book? How many times have I read in her bio that she writes these books first and foremost for herself. Yes, the book is unrealistic even for vampire standards. Yes, it does all come together in a rather neat little package. Maybe some of you think Bella should have had to  give up something, depending on if she chose Jacob or Edward. But think, if you had been writing about these characters for as long as she has, wouldn't you want them to all get their happy ending? I for one, only wanted a happy ending for these characters and I feel that I got it. So, maybe you think that it is bad and gives a biased picture of marriage and motherhood at 18, but it is a book, and a romance book at that. So if that is what Meyer wanted to do with this book, I say good for her.
031606792X|4.0|I understand that a lot of people have been increasingly disappointed by this book, but I ask \\"How would YOU end it?\\"   Personally I think Stephenie Meyer did the best she could.   Did Bella turn into a vampire? Check.  Did Bella and Jacob finally work out a way to have a relationship?  Check.  Do Bella and Edward live happily ever after? Check.    Personally I think these 3 topics have been the most controversial between the fans and Stephenie fulfulled them. As an author you can't please them all but you try to please the most. I loved the fact that Bella not only took on the maternal role with her baby \\"Nessie\\", but the fact that she grew up! This wasn't the same as the previous 3 where Bella was whiney, couldn't decide anything, and wanted it all. In the book, Yes she did get it all, but she was willing to make sacrifices. She wasn't whiney about it, she was mature and did what she thought would be best not for herself this time around, but others. There is still enough romance in the book between Edward and Bella to keep fans interested. but I feel this book was able to grow the characters to adults and to live together.   I feel really disappointed for everyone who is threatening to burn this book (for lack of better words). We all knew Stephenie Meyer loves happy endings, this was a happy ending. This was the book where people were able to live in peace, no more dying, killing, or revenge. We all have to get a long someday right?     Last, I am DISGUSTED with critics, fans, etc criticizing the book for the early marriage, the child, etc. This does NOT promote team pregnancy. Bella was married! Besides, unless you have yet to catch on now.. it's a fantasy novel (hint: vampires, powers, werewolves, etc). If you are seriously suggesting that your daughter wants to become pregnant now because of a vampire love story then you need to recheck your job as a parent and not blame in on a fictional book.
B0016NF06O|2.0|A little disappointing.   The music on this CD can be found on many other Willie Nelson CD's.  Nothing new.
031606792X|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I really liked this book. The baby was an unexpected twist, not one that I necessarily liked, but she made it work. I sort of would have liked a fight scene but in a sense I suppose its good that it didn't end in violence. I like that once Bella became a vampire, she was able to save and protect the others, no longer the weakest link. She took her power, practiced, and worked hard to learn how to control it. Alice leaving was definitely unexpected, but it all made sense. I'm glad none of the main characters died. And I LIKE that Bella got a complete happy ending with everything more or less perfect. I'm a sucker for happy endings and people being happy, so I enjoyed that. Yes, I said it, let the hating begin.    I understand complaints that Bella got everything in the end, but its a book. Girls reading it shouldn't take anyone in it as a complete role model, set off to become just like them. If authors cared what girls who were reading the book thought, then Hermione from Harry Potter, a strong intelligent girl, would not have ended up with Ron, someone who completely disrespected her person, her intelligence, and her passions. There's no problem learning something from characters and taking bits and pieces of them to shape into your own life, but anyone who can't distinguish fiction from real life, who expects everything to turn out perfect in the end, will be set up for a big disappointment. Books aren't meant to teach people how to act and be, that's the parents job. If kids are looking for role models in books, then its the parents who should be condemned, not a book.
031606792X|5.0|Though some seemed to disagree, I LOVED how everything worked out and there was a Happily Ever After for this series. There is still potential for problems down the road with the Volture and, hopefully, some more books. I'm very happy that she ended it on a positive note instead of something like the Potter ending that was so disapointing and, frankly, annoying. I'm glad that someone still believes in true love and happily ever after. :)
031606792X|4.0|Wow!  I just finished reading, and I am stunned by the reviews and reactions that I am seeing.  While BD isn't my favorite book in the series, I still loved it and thought that it was a satisfying end to the series.  I'm shocked at all the negative reviews.  I'm left wondering, what did you want to see happen in BD?
031606792X|1.0|I must give my heart felt thank you to Ms. Meyer's for this book.  Since about 9:00 pm EST I have been listening to my wife COMPLAIN NON STOP about this book.  I have read the first book only and that was enough for me.  My wife has read all of them now and also Host.  She has was floored by how bad this book is and wants her money back- NO END!  She was faithful to all the other books and bought them for her iPod to listen to at work.      She agrees with all other posters here who have ripped this book to shreds.  I will never read this tripe and am pleased about it.  The Charlene Harris Southern Vampire/Sookie Stackhouse books are MUCH better and Ms. Meyer's seems to have taken a lot from that series into this one... to a point.      When I say tripe I do read this type of material, (as said to the above Charlene Harris, Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series ***Which is MUCH better than J.K. Rowling's tripe***, Stephen King, Terry Brooks Sword of Shanara, and Garth Nix's books) and the first book had me laughing at the sub level plot and speed nature of a plot that was so predictable that I was wondering if I need to clean the fridge while reading the first one.    Back on topic now.  My wife is still complaining about this book as I type, about the subserviant nature of Bella, the STUPID name of the baby which I tried to read and couldn't understand it, and the switching of point of view was just too much.  If each book (Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse) was told by a different person would be fine, but not in a single book.    She just said that if she was going to re-write the story from Edward's point of view, NO THANKS! If it ends like this.    So thank you Meyer, for the hellish week I have ahead of me.    Thank You!    Who can I write to for my wife's money back?
031606792X|1.0|First I would like to say that about a month ago, I picked up Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse to scan them for my 11 year old cousin to see how appropriate they actually were.  I was surprised to find that I fell in love with the books and SM's quality of writing.  I quickly devoured all three books, returned to the bookstore and promptly bought and read The Host as well. All 4 books were read cover to cover within 2 days.  Since then I have read them all a few times over again.      So naturally I lined up for the new book and devoured it the night it came out.  I didn't dislike the book.  I know there are a lot of readers that disliked the \\"message\\" of the book and the story in general but I wasn't one of them.  I was entertained but the book lacked the haunting quality that the first 3 books have.  I felt disassociated from all of the characters that I previously had loved.     Add to that confusion in parts of this book due to lack of consistency in the story.  Rosalie is suddenly her best friend and the child's most avid protector because of her own selfishness yes... but why does Bella continue to shun Edward and welcome Rose around her?  The same rose to whom she is nothing but antagonistic towards in all 3 of the previous books.  I think this would have been alleviated if this portion of the book had been written from Bella's point of view, instead of Jacob's.      I actually really liked that she added some of the story from Jacob's point of view, I just wish it hadn't been this part of the story.  I feel like I lost the largest part of the story when SM switches perspective just as Bella learns she is pregnant and returns home.      I just felt something was missing.  In the end, I no longer related to Bella, Edward,Jacob and never with Nessie.  My overall review would be that the book was a good entertaining read but lacked that special haunting quality the first three parts of the story contained.      That being said, I can't wait for Midnight Sun, I hope SM sticks to the format of the first chapter she has available on her website for preview...
031606792X|5.0|I was honestly worried when I got my book. I'd heard the rumors. People on LiveJournal canceling orders, people freaking. (Ah, spoilers.) I didn't catch anything, and I was still assuming the only thing to happen would be what we all expected. Wedding, the transformation, happy ever after.    First thing- \\"OH CRUD SHE'S PREGNANT.\\" Okay. Got over that shock fairly well. She could get rid of it, right? She couldn't keep it- heavens no. It'd eat her alive. I'm highly pro-life...But no. We can't allow Bella to DIE like that.    Second thing- \\"OH CRUD SHE'S KEEPING IT?! DAMNIT, ROSALIE!\\" Rosalie's behavior disgusted me. Immensely. And she was keeping it. IT WAS EATING HER ALIVE AND SHE WAS KEEPING IT. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!    Third thing- \\"....Jacob...IMPRINTED ON THE CHILD?!?!?\\" Holy. Snap. Where did THAT come from.     But, through the pure INSANITY that all was...it was oddly captivating. I liked it. Maybe I'm broken in the mind, but it provided an AMAZING story.    All in all- Amazing. Jacob redeemed himself nicely in my eyes. (I honestly hated him deeply at the end of Eclipse.)  I loved seeing Daddy!Edward. It was rather cute.    Only objection: Why can't Bella name her child something BETTER? Geez.    Some of the stuff floating around is bothering me now. Such as \\"How could Bella not feel Edward giving her those bruises?!\\" I will say this about that one subject- When you're lost in some things, you flat out don't acknowledge things like bruises. And remember, kiddies. It was only bruises- It couldn't have hurt THAT bad. Not with the strength Edward has.    All that worry for nothing. Nice book. I rather adored it.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|No matter how many times you've seen Lonesome Dove, it's NEVER looked or sounded this good. The old DVD was fuzzy and soft, the sound muted, this new 2 disc set has crystal clear images and fabulous stereo sound. Friday night we started watching LD again, Part One on the old fuzzy DVD that's been around for years...I bought this new edition and WOW...it's stunning, the clarity, the landscapes, sunsets, it's well worth buying this again for this MAJOR upgrade in picture and sound.<br /><br />To clarify those who replied to my review, I did indeed view the new version . I bought it retail at a store which has a habit of putting releases on the shelves early. For the most part, releases are shipped to stores on a Thursday or Friday, and are held until the release date, Tuesdays. This retailer will often place new stock on the shelves early, so, yes, I bought it early.
B0019Y8G9I|5.0|This has to be an album of the year, just like the Robert Plant & Alison Krauss Album i would never have contemplated putting Nelson & Marsalis together...... But wow what a corker!!!! this is Hot Jazz style Blues that really swings its like stepping back to a more gracefull & elegant age & the recording by Blue Note is right up there with the very best. Cant fault it, thanks guys
031606792X|5.0|The first thing I have to say is that I loved every second of BD.<br />From the first page to the very last, this book captivated me. This<br />book was nothing like I had imagined, but again none of the other<br />books were either. I love how SM can create so many twists and turns<br />that you never even get a chance to catch your breath. I went into<br />this book with an open mind and with the idea of letting SM tell me<br />Bella and Edward's story. I tried to remember this is her story and<br />is like nothing I've ever read. I think this attitude saved me a lot<br />of disappointment and allowed me to truly enjoy the story for what it<br />was.<br /><br />SM's writing style is beyond anything I've ever read. She takes you<br />to places with her words like you're actually there. I felt every<br />fear, joy, and triumph of the characters throughout the book. I went<br />into this story wanting three main things - B/E to marry, B/E to get<br />it on &lt;wink, wink> and Jacob to imprint. I got everything I wanted<br />and so much more. I actually really enjoyed getting Jake's<br />perspective for part of the book. This made it more realistic for me.<br />Edward or Bella were not in place mentally (and/or physically) to<br />tell that part of the story. I think it was an integral part of the<br />story for us to hear from Jake's POV. I loved watching him grow and<br />mature into the character he was always meant to be.<br /><br />I also really loved watching Bella grow and change into what she was<br />always meant to be - a strong character both physically and mentally.<br />I felt the way SM combined the \\"new\\" Bella with the old was<br />brilliant. We all grow and change in our attitude and how we react as<br />we get older and gain experience; I felt it only appropriate for Bella<br />to grow and change as the story progressed. I've read other series<br />where the characters stagnate and stay locked into what the author<br />made them in to originally. This to me is unrealistic. Characters<br />should change throughout a series as the characters gains new<br />experiences. Despite the changes Bella goes through, I feel that she<br />maintains the true essence of the Bella we have all grown to know and<br />love - she is fearless, loyal beyond belief, brave, and very unaware<br />of how the world truly sees her.<br /><br />The action and intensity of this book was also something that was very<br />unexpected, but an aspect that truly left me breathless at times. I<br />cried, cringed, cried some more, smiled, laughed out loud, and felt<br />true compassion and more love for fictional characters then I thought<br />was possible. Again like I said in the beginning this book was like<br />nothing I expected, but I'm so grateful for that now. I could never<br />have imagined the gift that SM gave to her readers in BD. I know some<br />may have been caught off balance by this book, but I believe that it<br />is her best work yet in the Twilight series.changes Bella goes through, I feel that she  maintains the true essence of the Bella we have all grown to know and  love - she is fearless, loyal beyond belief, brave, and very unaware  of how the world truly sees her.

031606792X|5.0|. . . oh well, it's never stopped me before.  I liked this book.  I really REALLY liked this book!  It was not what I expected (but then again, I was disappointed in Eclipse so I learned to stop expecting some things).  But it was definitely worth sitting up all night to read.  Bella and Edward seemed stronger than ever by the end.  I even learned to appreciate Jacob.      After reading spoilers I just knew I'd be revolted by the idea that Jacob imprinted on Bella and Edward's baby (which I was . . . a little).  But when I read it, I didn't feel nearly as disturbed as I thought I would.  It actually explained some things from the previous books.  And now I must admit I'm curious to see how Nessie and Jacob's story will play out.  By the way, I do hate the name `Nessie'.  It seems that Bella did too so I guess I'm in good company.  LOL!      Oh, and to those actually reading these reviews for helpful info- Edward did not pimp Bella.  I read that in a review and was like \\"WHAT!!\\"  The scene in question is really quite short and is not what you think it is.  Edward comes close to losing his mind with worry over Bella; that scene is just one of the ways that fact is illustrated.  To be honest, I ended up feeling pretty horrible about how helpless Edward was at that point.  He was forced to watch and do nothing as the baby killed Bella from the inside(ack!).      Which leads me to my last point: Jacob's POV was interesting.  It helped us see a side of the two main characters (Edward in particular) that we rarely see.  Jacob's POV humanized Edward . . . made him appear more vulnerable . . . more helpless . . . than we've ever seen before from Bella's POV.  It was interesting because we got to see just how much of a struggle it is for Edward to keep his worries, fears, etc. away from Bella.  While Edward is being humanized from Jacob's perspective, Jacob begins to humanize the Cullen's' on his own.  It's cool to see his thoughts go from pure hate to grudging and then easyacceptance.  The resulting Edward and Jacob friendship is great to see.        Overall, I'm happy I didn't let the spoilers dissuade me.  I enjoyed this book.
031606792X|2.0|I agree with many of the other reviews, this book went in a totally different direction from the previous novels.  I think what made those other books so good was her characters, how we can identify with them and what they are going through.  But with this book that is gone before you reach the quarter mark.  Once you find out she's pregnant then BAM! off to a new style and angle.  It became all about the baby and that left me cold and feeling left out too (just like Edward).  If SM used a different style originially I wouldn't have been so annoyed by this but on the other hand thats thats why I love the books and have read them over and over again.  This won't turn me off to SM's work in the future.  I thought The Host was great, also very much character centered.  But she tried to change herself into an action writer in this one book and that just isn't her style.
031606792X|1.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book, but I didn't think coherency was completely out of the realm of possibilities. Obviously the 'Twilight' series isn't a piece of literary mastery, and I was completely fine with that for the first three. But something went wrong in this one. If you haven't read the series and want to, read the first one and pretend like it ended there. Otherwise, you might just want to let this one slide. Your friends and family may respect you more if you can say you weren't part of this whole debacle.
0061537934|5.0|I ordered and read this book because a blog I am on reads a book about dogs once a month and discusses the book.  I was hooked from the start to the end.  Enzo is a great personage and is more human than anything else.  I absolutely loved the hope and inspiration expressed throughout the book and especially the ending.  This book is a must read for all dog lovers.   Carol Yunker (The Mixed Mutt Dog House team on SparkPeople.com)
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|When I first followed music, there were cetain artists that you just could count on releasing great material.  Coldplay could join rock's list of consistently great artists - joining the Beatles, Who, Elvis Costello, REM,to name a few.  The current release, Viva La Vida, pleases your ears from the beginning track to the last.  VLV has the classic sound to it(congrats to the engineers)and has become my favorite Coldplay CD.  The title track brings goose bumps: a meeting of great melody, soulful singing, and reflective lyrics.  At first I wondered why such a gem would sit back at track 7, but it works.  The previous six songs build to it, the remaining songs cascade away.  This must be on your buy list.
B000WTNCQS|1.0|Really, does anyone noticed a real SOUND improvement over the early 90s edition of this cd?
031606792X|5.0|you knew that it wasn't going to be cut and dry or what you expected-- that's how the series has been. who could have imagined edward leaving for 2/3 of new moon??? or that bella might think she had feelings for jacob in eclipse??? i think that there are people who are going to be disappointed no matter what happens, because it is the end and there is really nowhere else for it to go. i give stephenie credit for thinking of things that i don't think ANYONE could have predicted. and THANK GOD bella ended up with edward! hahahaha.     one complaint IS that ithink a lot of people expected that bella was going to have to make more choices, give things up. scarifice some things to get others. and in real life, that is what happens. rarely, do you get everything. but in this book, it is all tied up in a little bow-- bella gets EVERYTHING she wants, and then some. jacob doesn't get hurt by her. etc etc. i love a happy ending, so i am not really complaining... i just think that it's obviously not what would happen in real life (not that vampires are real, but just the principle of the thing, about make choices and compromises).
1400049628|5.0|Should zombies ever rise, I know I will now be prepared!  Anyone with any question of that would do good to purchase this book.  It really has everything you could think of in case of a zombie uprising; shelter, food, weapons, transportation.  Even though this is fictional, it reads like an actual how-to, making it that much more interesting.  I'd highly recommend World War Z, too.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|If you're an experienced listener who enjoyed the sound of Moody Blues, the Strawbs, Barclay James Harvest, or the Pet Sounds version of the Beach Boys, you will love this album.  If you dig the beauty of the Shins or Iron and Wine, you will love this album.  It's amazing how music is reinvented to sound so fresh.  Congrats to Fleet Foxes on their first CD having the sound of seasoned minstrels.
630522577X|5.0|Years ago I saw the original Broadway stage version with Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews. This film version is more complex, with more in-depth characterization, and is impeccably filmed with many imaginative and original touches. Audrey Hepburn was an attractive Liza, but her singing was done by Marnie Nixon, and her cockney speech at the very beginning of the movie was needlessly incomprehensible. It was a classic Hollywood mistake not to use Julie Andrews in the screen version.<br /> Harrison is brilliant as Henry Higgins, and the supporting cast is first-rate. The musical numbers are well-structured with a flair and zest which shows George Cukor's taste and sensibilities. The movie deservedly won eight Oscars.<br /> The widescreen, letter-box version I found annoying as I usually do. The movie's sumptuous sets seemed to lose out by this process.<br /> The movie is enlightening about the British class system which persists to this day. Higgin's mansion is artfully rendered, and the scenes in which the servants sing are captivating.<br /> This film captures the spirit, the style, and the genius of the musical and provides us with an archival record of the show.
031606792X|1.0|If you plan to read the twilight saga, please STOP at the 3rd book, Eclipse. If you do read Breaking Dawn, prepare to control the very strong urge to return or burn the book. The plot is a ridiculous fan fiction gone awry and the characters are unbearable and lack depth.      This book could have been an incredible end to this incredible series, but the series now ends on a lackluster note and in turn undermines the entire series. The final book does not have a sense of completeness and only leaves you thinking: \\"I couldn't have thought of a worse way to end this series other than killing everyone.\\"
031606792X|5.0|I've read a lot of the reviews, and while I can see where people are coming from, and I do agree that this is an unusual plot. I actually think SM got it Right. Here's why:    1. She develops Edward and Bella into adults throughout the plot. While some think that characters were lost; I think their characters were strengthened to those of real life.    2. SM showed her teen audience the consequences of unprotected sex. Say what you may about the pregnancy being unrealistic, but SM never wrote that Edward didn't have any bodily fluids (if she did, please show me where.) But this novel makes a moral statement about sex, I think that this goes along with SM's themes throughout the book. Choices. Responsibility.    3. I loved how SM made Bella into a hero. She refuses to abort her baby, defying even Edward, something she's never done like this. I think Bella is a hero because she takes control of her destiny. She protects those that she love.    4. While many have noted the lack of sacrifice in the book, I beg to differ. Certainly Bella sacrifices a great deal. She mentions wanting to go to Dartmouth, wanting a little more time, but then that is robbed from her. She almost dies as the consequence of her actions. Almost all the vampires die, ALMOST. I know that many think that this is a cop-out, but I don't see it that way. Breaking Dawn is ladden with anguish and darkness. We all the characters that we love suffer tremendously, but after all this suffering there is a happy ending. Is that so wrong?    5. While many wanted Breaking Dawn to be like the first 3 books, we really wouldn't have been satisfied with that ending. Do you really think that Bella and Edward were going to continue on like they were? This may be fiction, but SM knows her characters well. Their substance in this book grew from a couple who loved to stare at each other, to a couple who shares joy, pain, and responsibility. Perhaps the reason that many fans didn't like the book was for the moral, traditional messages it instills.    Any thoughts? I'd love to hear them.
031606792X|5.0|Thank you, Stephenie Meyer, for tying up your incredible love story.  I couldn't imagine a more perfect ending.  I was engrossed from start to finish.  Beautiful.
031606792X|5.0|Ok.  Anyone reading this reviews is looking for spoilers so I won't bother holding back.<br /><br />First I loved the first part of the book, the wedding preparation, the wedding itself and Bellas beautiful words on the beach holding Edwards hand.  Very touching.  I would have loved more info on the actual physical side of the act but this is YA.<br /><br />The pregnancy would have been ok for me if it wasnt so SF/Twilight zone.  That said I was glad she did have Edwards child.  Hated the childs name, both the offical and nickname.  Wasn't wrapped in the whole Jacob story either and had to skip some parts where I thought they were going to force Bella to get rid of the baby.<br /><br />The child itself was charming and all the Cullens were great with her.  Jacob imprinting on her - not so cool.  But it guess it had to happen in order for the wolves to protect them for the book ending.<br /><br />I almost felt that as long as this book was and even with the fact I still enjoyed it, it should have been split into two books.  It would have given the author time to kick back the frantic pace and really indulge in the beautiful slow mesmerising pace of the first two books.  I also would have preferred it only from Bella's POV.<br /><br />Did enjoy the descriptions of Bella as a vampire and can't wait for Edwards book.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies and I'm introducing yet another cohort!
031606792X|5.0|This was definitely different than what I was expecting.  I think to whole Bella conceiving a child was a great twist.  How can anyone be so certain it is impossible?  Has an immortal ever loved a human so deeply and with such tenderness?  They make magic together, so anything is possible.  Bella may have been consider whiny, but it was always her natural instinct to try to protect those she loved, so it was not surprise she had was going to keep a \\"thing\\" conceived with Edward, no matter what it cost her.  Not as much action/violence as I expected. I little disturbed by Jacob imprinting on Bella and Edward's daughter.  But all in all, absolutely a happy ending for me...    Thank you SM for such a wonderful imagination......
031606792X|1.0|I am, or WAS, a huge fan of the Twilight series, but after reading Breaking Dawn I am SOOOOOO disappointed that I can't even begin to express it!!!     DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!!The plot read like a poorly written fan fiction, with things happening in it that were so unbelieveable and completely idiotic. Stephenie pretty much has taken the liberty of doing whatever she wants when it comes to vampires. It's not even like she's writing about vampires, just anorexic people with poor blood circulation giving them cold skin.     ***SPOILERS*** BELOW:  The basic plot involved Bella whining a lot, Bella and Edward having sex many times until miraculously she is about 5 months pregnant even though it's less than a week before her missed period, Jacob wants to kill everyone until the freak baby is born then he falls in love and imprints on her, and they live \\"happily ever after\\" in their frozen-as-teenagers state. Someone beat me over the head! IT'S GOD AWFUL!!!
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers an extremely well-researched and fascinating book about Lincoln and his leadership style. You don't have to be a history fan to truly enjoy this book as it is beautifully-crafted and highly readable. It is also filled with loads of interesting tales such as how unlikely it was that Lincoln was elected in the first place, and also how he was continually criticized by the press until the very end of his career. It also gives an excellent insight into the causes of the Civil War, personalities of the generals, and how Lincoln interacted with and motivated the troops.      This will be one of the most meaty and detailed books that you'll read, and this can cause it to drag slightly in places as the author invests just as much research into all of the other candidates that ultimately wind up in Lincoln's cabinet. This causes the book to be a bit slow in the beginning as the reader becomes familiar with all of the other characters, but it pays off in the end as it gives crucial background that foreshadows later events. Overall it is a wonderful book that fully showcases Lincoln's genius, and hopefully provides a model that could be followed by anyone in a leadership position.
B0017MO10U|5.0|The story of the movie is exactly what I expected (I was kind of sick about the invincible Ori, they had to resort to magic to destroy them in Ark of Truth).   A whole new adventure. It lacked the spaceships's fights with asgard technology I wanted, but it was cool anyways.  It tied a few loose ends. I hope it's not the last SG1 movie.  Nice work, the audio is incredible when hooked to HT. Video is amazing in a 52\\" 1080P LCD. It was worth the wait.  I'm looking forward for the next movie.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Definitely, one of he best science fiction series I have ever known of.  The cast is great, not to mention the special effects and the plots.  I strongly recommend Stargate as a must-have series.
031606792X|3.0|**SPOILERS**    This book had all the elements that I expected and at the same time took a very unexpected turn. On one hand, I expected Bella to become a vampire with unusual powers (I even anticipated her incredible self-control and ability to shield others like she was able to shield herself).  I also expected Jacob to imprint on someone since SM is a romantic and likes Jacob too much to not give him his happy ending.  Finally, the confrontation with the Volturi was expected, though very anti-climatic.        On the other hand, I did not expect Bella to get pregnant and I really didn't care for this twist (though it certainly opens the door for future books from Nessie's perspective).  I, too, have heard that SM has stated that vampires cannot have children since their bodies are frozen in the moment that they die.  After doing a little searching however, I found that she has also stated \\"Most human fluids are absent in my vampires\\" (Italics mine).  Since Bella was still human when she got pregnant and technically fluids are not completely absent in vampires, this does not rule out the possibility of a half-vampire/half-human child.      Since I did not anticipate the pregnancy, I also did not expect the changes in the characters involved.  I would agree that some of the characters did not feel consistent to me (especially Bella). I am however, trying to keep in mind that she becomes another person in this book so it is reasonable to expect her character to be different in Breaking Dawn.  When Bella is human, she sees herself as plain and un-extraordinary.  She cannot fathom why Edward wants to be with her.  When she becomes a vampire, Bella is no longer the weak human that Edward will always have to defend.  I think this allows her to finally feel worthy of him and gives her the self-confidence that is absent in the early books.  In addition to these changes, Bella also becomes a mother.  Though not a mother myself, I know that becoming a parent has the abilityto change a person in immeasurable ways and alter a person's priorities.  It is true that this book does not focus so much on the love between Edward and Bella, but that is because there is finally someone else in Bella's life that she loves as deeply as Edward.  I believe the reason Breaking Dawn does not focus so much on Edward and Bella's relationship is because SM is attempting to show the love that exists between a mother and her child - we already know how Bella feels about Edward and vice versa.      Was it how I would have imagine Bella and Edward's story to end?  No.  Did it feel rushed at times?  Yes, but being a 700+ page book, I don't know how much of this was SM's choice or simply practicality and editing.     Are the harsher reviews warranted?  Not in my opinion.      Though this was my least favorite book in the Twilight saga, it wasn't a bad story.   Overall, an okay ending to the series.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I am not the biggest of Talking Heads fans, but I do like much of their work.  Yet, this is the one Talking Heads video or album you must have.  The concert is really cool and I love when David Byrne(sp?) leaves the stage to the remaining members of his band to do a few as the Tom Tom Club.  If you need pyrotechnics and laser lighting to enjoy a show...this is not for you.  But, if you appreciate an artist and want to see his interpretation of his music.....here it is.  I have given this one as gifts to those that wouldn't buy it themselves.  They have always been glad to have it in their collection.
031606792X|5.0|This does NOT contain any spoilers.  I'll be honest, I'm technically too old to be a Twilight fan, but I'm not ashamed. I went to the midnight release party with girls more than half my age, and had a great time. I read all through the night, and much to my boss' chagrin, all day at work too.  First off, there were some editing issues in the story, typos mainly. This is something I find when the publishers rush the process, it happens, it's annoying, I got over it. The bottom line, it didn't ruin the overall feel of the book.  I loved Breaking Dawn. I hated Breaking Dawn. I loved it in the end, much like New Moon. Warning for parents - you may want to prepare younger readers (under 13) of some adult themes. This book is darker, and more sensual than the previous books in the Twilight Series. Much like the last books of Harry Potter.  One must definitely suspend their disbelief in Breaking Dawn more so than the other novels - it's a vampire novel after all. This is Stephenie Meyer's universe, she makes the rules and we are mere observers. The great lesson that I am taking away from Breaking Dawn is that the rules change, people change, that's the way that life is. Stephenie Meyer did a great job on this finale, she has taught me great life lessons, and I hope that the younger generation will embrace those lessons as well.  If you can sit back and enjoy the journey and follow the process through, it is definitely worth the emotional roller coaster.  Another success from Stephenie Meyer.
031606792X|5.0|I love a happy ending. I loved Breaking Dawn. Stephenie Meyer said she wrote the book that she wanted. It was exactly what I wanted, too. I read a spoiler ahead of time and thought it sounded cheesy, but reading the book start to finish, it all made sense. People may be weirded out by the Jacob imprinting thing, but it does make sense.    I loved the humor in the book. I loved the way Stephenie Meyer makes non-sex scenes sexy. I loved it all!
B00005YW4H|5.0|What a beautiful voice!  I could listen to her for hours and hours!  The music is palatable and soothing, kind of a folksy jazz.  If you like Anita Baker, Carole King, and Anne Wilson, you'll like Norah-just wonderful.  I'll copy this review on her two other most recent works, as it applies there as well.  She has established and proven herself, with a wide-enough body of work, so that she deserves all the recognition for a wonderful talent that she gets, and then some!
031606792X|4.0|The Twilight series has always been a major favorite of mine. They were all of a simple teen romance, altared by the fact that it was shared between a mortal, vampire, and werewolf. When I picked up this book, I knew it was going to be different than Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse. But we can't blame Stephenie Meyer for making an ending that may not satisfy you; how do you think you would cope with ending the Twilight series?    I think she put everyone's best interest in tying up the saga. It may have been strange and unusual, but endings can't always be happy. Honestly, she could not complete the series with another happy-go-lucky twist like she did in Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.    It was a different style of writing, more mature I think. It may not have been the epic romance battle that everyone was anticipating, but we all knew who Bella would end up with. Don't deny it.    For all you Jacob fans, I'm terribly sorry that you have to cope with the idea that the love of his life is a toddler. It was not what I expected, but then again, this book was completely unpredictable.    All of the facts that Meyer justicfied in Q&As were unjustified in the book. Pregnancies? That caught me by surprise, but I think she wanted to bring out the message to teens about unwanted pregnancies.    Everyone in the book got what they wanted, but the fans surely did not. After reading countless reviews, I can see that many fans were disappointed by this highly anticipated book. It was different, oh yeah. But not everything can be the froofy romance that we want it to be.     The book was not as great as the first three (which I completely adored), but not everyone can have what they want exactly. It was a great series, and I will honestly miss it. Even though people may dislike this book, no one can deny that Stephenie Meyer created one of the best romance and beautiful tales in the world.
031606792X|5.0|Meyer is absolutely brilliant as far as I'm concerned. I could'nt help from having a huge smile on my face throughout the book. Just perfect and a perfect ending!!!!
0810994739|4.0|My son (10) loved this book.  He is the middle child with an older brother and younger brother.  He wishes they had more for him to read- can't wait for the next one to come out.  He couldn't put the book down.  It was easy for me to get him to read over the summer!!
B00018D44U|5.0|What a beautiful voice!  I could listen to her for hours and hours!  The music is palatable and soothing, kind of a folksy jazz.  If you like Anita Baker, Carole King, and Anne Wilson, you'll like Norah-just wonderful.  I'll copy this review on her two other most recent works, as it applies there as well.  She has established and proven herself, with a wide-enough body of work, so that she deserves all the recognition, for a wonderful talent, that she gets, and then some!
B001BMKOZW|5.0|This is a great albut but the lyrics are simpe.  The music is top notch.  I've seen the vids on youtube and knew I was buying this album.  As a bonus for me, Franky Perez is the guitarist & backing vocals, I'm a huge fan of him and his album Poor Mans Son.
0689835604|4.0|We are on child #2 with this book and both of my kids have requested it over and over and over and over. My youngest, 19 months, is 'reading' it to us. I found my 5 yr old reading it to the youngest one last night.<br /><br />It is easy to understand, fun for the babies and easily read by my other kid. What could be better? Well, maybe a space age polymer that keeps the flaps on when an overzealous toddler continues to try and wrestle them off.
031606792X|5.0|I liked the book.  It was nothing like I expected, but it was still good.
B0015D3YQI|4.0|Dario Argento's 'Phenomena' is a a gem of a B-movie with enough engaging and entertaining characteristics to make this film well worth your time if you're into such genre novelties.  When you have a film that features a monkey sidekick, a crippled scientific genius, an all-girls boarding school in Europe, Jennifer Connelly in her teenage glory, insect swarms, rotting corpses and a few other surprises the question is - what doesn't this film have?  One of Argento's more entertaining films and a decent dvd to boot - lots of extras and an above average transfer.
B000007OTH|5.0|This 2-CD set of Bruch's 3 symphonies and five violin pieces is a compilation of downright beautiful music.  Bruch's romantic symphonies are exquisitely crafted- chock full of lush themes and wonderful orchestration.  If you're unfamiliar with them (as I was) at one moment you'll be thinking Schumann, then at another Brahms.  There are moments of Mahler-like bombast but fortunately they're few and brief.    The violin pieces are as good or even better- ranging from a virtuosic tour-de-force to haunting introspection.    Both the orchestral and solo violin playing are very well done- no negatives here.  And I disagree with a (much earlier) reviewer- I thought Philips did a nice job with the sound throughout, both in the miking and recording.    If you're a fan of Romantic music, and especially German Romantic music (is there any better?) you'll enjoy this modestly-priced CD set as an addition to your collection.
031606792X|2.0|*Minor Spoilers*  For the most part, I enjoyed reading the first three books in the twilight saga. Needless to say, I couldn't believe that Breaking Dawn was written by the same author who wrote the three books prior to it. It was a letdown and  an embarrassing work of fiction. All the ground rules and character development present in the other books were completely shattered for me in this one. Bella pregnant? Not only does Edward have two more chromosomal pairs than Bella, but she is also extremely frail, even for a human. How did she survive THAT? She is also a horrible role model for girls everywhere. She lacks any iota of independence and her main goal in life was to have a creepy vampire baby, or die trying (all the while ditching an education so she can start a family at age 18). Do I even have to mention the repulsiveness of Jacob imprinting on Bella's vampire hybrid daughter, while simultaneously coming to embrace Edward as a brother when a couple hundred pages earlier he wanted to kill him? This book had an entirely different tone. Darker. Less humor. Her forced happy ending seemed too superficial to be real, and undermined the importance of choice in the previous books. Stephenie Meyer has always said how much she loves her characters. And so she gives them a \\"happy\\" ending. However, in the process, she made me dislike them and the world she created. If you haven't read Breaking Dawn. Don't. Stop now. Save yourself the disappointment. Create a better picture for yourself than the bad fanfic-like novel that is Burning Dawn.
031606792X|3.0|Let me first say that I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a good read, interesting, and riveting up until the final chapter. It was the perfect book to read over the summer. However it was not a good Twilight book. While I did enjoy it, I will not be reading it again, nor really ever connecting it to the other 3 Stephanie Meyer books which I know and love. The first three books were so good that I had high expectations for this book, but it was a different more erratic style then the first three and lacked their depth.       My first problem came with the pregnancy. Ironically the night the book came out me and my cousin were debating whether or not Bella could become pregnant, and I said judging on Esme and Rosalie, if they both wanted children and were unable to have any, the men most certainly would not be able to produce any children either. Also Bella was in no shape to raise a child, and based on her actions in the previous three books, didn't want one either. However in this book she becomes ultimately protective and motherly towards her child, and that is somewhat kind of believable as she is maturing a bit in this book, however what really got me was not Bella's sudden change of heart on becoming a teenage-mother (I mean what the heck? She goes from never wanting to get married early, to thrilled to be pregnant at 18) , but the pregnancy itself. I don't like Meyer's stilted explanation for why the men vampires can reproduce with humans, but the girls can't. If it had been somewhat alluded to in the earlier books then it would make sense, but instead it felt really awkward, sort of like the baby's name (I think it should have been Carlie Renesemee Cullen instead).        Unlike a lot of fans, I didn't have a problem with Jacob imprinting on Nessa. Since we already knew about Quil and Claire, it made sense, and there was a prior example to prepare us. Also while I appreciated the Jacob angst, it was nice to see him get over Bella.        The Volturi epic battle was a bit of a problem for me. At first I thought it had a lot of potential. Here was a chance for the ultimate debate, is a government that keeps control of a dark force but suffers from corruption better than complete anarchy where the dark force runs rampant. Instead of answering or even really greatly addressing this question except in a short speech by revolutionary vampire Garrett, we get a temporary confrontation which answers nothing, and concludes nothing. With an exception of the vampire that turns the Cullens in there are no deaths. There is no epic battle. The Volturi still rule and may strike again at the Cullens. I thought Bella's power was awesome and its power explained because it had been so strong when she when she was human. The ending was just incomplete, and overly happy. It seems like Meyer came up with a great epic battle scene, Vlturi v. Werewolf-Vampire Alliance, and then just had everyone at the battlefield decide to procrastinate the inevitable confrontation which must occur and say thats alright. I think that more than anything really bugged me.         What made the 1st three books so good was the emotional angst each of the characters went through. The angst was adressed in this book, but not with nearly as much skill or prominense, and everything was resolved to quickly and way to happy-go-lucky that it didn't fit. I did want Bella and Edward to find there Happily-Ever After, but less haphazardly. Overall this was a good book to read on a lazy summers day, but it was like the epilogue in Harry Potter, it was nice knowing how everything turned out, but it just didn't measure up to the other three.
031606792X|1.0|As a proud badge carrying member of Team Jacob, I fully expected to hate Breaking Dawn.  My expectations were down, Stephanie Meyer has told us multiple times that Bella would be with Edward in the end (which, side note, wth book author, you don't spoil the plot of your love triangle romance book by TELLING people who she's going to end up with!?) but authors have lied to us before, I still had a glimmer of hope that Bella and Jacob could be together and have a wonderful life.  Well Meyer lied to us alright, just not about Jacob and Bella.    (SPOILERS BELOW)    Breaking Dawn was such a severe disappointment, even for a person who was EXPECTING disappointment, that I'd go right ahead and say this book is not worth buying.  Ignore it's existence!    Bella, who has always been an anti-feminist in her complete inability to rely on herself and how every decision in her life is based on what a boy wants, has gotten worse.  Now, even though she didn't want children, even though part of the reason that made her decision to chose Edward so difficult was the fact that she could never HAVE children, even though Meyer specifically told her readers that vampires couldn't have babies, she's pregnant.  Not only is she pregnant but the half vampire baby is killing her and both of her beloveds think it's a terrible idea to have the baby, but her life will never be complete without it.  In addition all those hardships she'd face because she became a vampire like incontrolable bloodlust and the fact that she'd never see her family again -- completely irrelevant.  Bella is the magical vampire lady who immediately can control the blood lust and she tells Charlie (well shows him) about her being a vamp and he's OK with it.      As for Bella and Jacob?  Well Jacob's still in love with her as we see from 200 glorious pages of his point of view (the only high point in the entire book, moderately well written, sarcastic, and down right funny) but Bella doesn't make one mention of that hardrealization she came to at the end of Eclipse.  That she loves Jacob, too.  That a part of her wants his warm arms around her and not Edward's cold ones.  Then, to make matters worse, after spending half of his point of view complaining about how much he hates imprinting (the werewolf quirk that has one werewolf find their \\"soul mate\\" in any random person, no matter how old they are) and how he would fight it and how he wants to choose who he falls in love with, Jacob imprints on Bella's DAUGHTER (named, laughably, Renesmee Carlie, that is Renee + Esme, Charlie + Carlisle, nicknamed by Jacob Nessie) and he's TOTALLY FINE WITH IT.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE FIRST SEES HER WHEN SHE'S ONLY SECONDS OLD.  And the readers are supposed to be happy that Jacob is in love and he gets to stay around Bella.  Who he thought about naked.  And wanted to marry and have babies with.  It's twisted and oedipal and it would be alright if Meyer admitted this but to her it's just one big happy family.      The rest of the Cullens, the vampires we've spent three books getting to know and understand (and in many people's cases, though not this reviewer's) love?  Well they're pushed to the side in favor of the baby plot and a whole bunch of other vampires (whom you can never remember the names of as there are about 30 of them) who show up and each get a page and a half of time.      The pack, that is the rest of the werewolves, are mostly ignored except for a moment with Quil so the reader may re-acquaint themselves with how SWEET and WONDERFUL and NOT AT ALL TOTALLY 100% CREEPY it is for a person to be in love with a 3 year old.  Seth Clearwater gets pagetime because he's the vampire's biggest fans (and therefore an acceptable pack member to talk about) and Leah who was originally feminist and awesome and had spark and spunk?  Well all she wants is a baby, apparently, because she's 20 years old and menopausal.      The humans who we've learned to deal with, like, or love, the students of Forks High School?  They barely get a mention.  Mike Newton, the happy, sweet classmate of Bella who's liked her since they met?  One sarcastic throwaway line (\\"Oh, Mike, how will I go on?\\" Bella says to Edward in response to a question about whether or not she'll miss her human friends, but of course she won't because why do they matter when she can hang out with AWSUM SPARKLY VAMPIRES WITH KEWL POWERZ) and one line about Edward purposefully flinging Bella's garter in his face at the wedding (in a sort of \\"haha I win!\\" statement).  Oh, brother.    All in all the book was a terrible waste of time and money.  If you liked the first three books and don't want to be disappointed, I'd suggest you find good fanfiction (or write good fanfiction) to fill the void Breaking Dawn will leave.
031606792X|1.0|I was physically sickened by the birth/pregnancy and Edward's insane discussion with Jacob. It was too much, and I had a difficult time getting through the rest of the book. All the characters took a backseat to this bizarre plot. I'm going back to my happy place (the meadow).
031606792X|5.0|This is not my husband writing this but, it is his account:    After finishing the book and reading the review I find that there are many readers who are very disappointed and let down. I AM NOT  First, let me say I LOVED IT- being a mother of 9 kids reading these           books have been a great escape from REALITY.  Second, The poor reviewers in my opinion were putting way to much into            it REMEMBER this was written for a teenager about a teenager.           Teenagers want the happy ending they do not expect alot.  Third, we can all be critical but, I believe Stepenie Meyers delivered            what everyone expected as to the finale to her charaters's lives.    Final thought: Why put to much into it . It was exciting and it made me  feel good at the end I got what I wanted sorry some of you didn't.    GREAT JOB STEPHENIE
031606792X|1.0|I struggled very hard to actually finish this book.     I love reading, and I consider myself an individual who can branch out and enjoy an array of different things, including books for younger readings. Even though I knew that the Twilight books were not literary works of art, I appreciated them deeply for being not only an addictive, easy read, but for being greatly enjoyable and having a good story that really touched my heart and made me care for the characters.      While many of my friends teased me for enjoying these books, I felt confident standing up for myself and defending the value of these stories.    Not anymore.    I feel nothing but ashamed, after having finished Breaking Dawn.    Not only do I feel embarrassed for having waited in line, screaming like a preteen and jumping up and down until I had the book in my hot little hands, but I'm starting to feel sick about appreciating a book which is advocating so many negative things.    *SPOILERS BELOW, BEWARE*    For one: This book is extremely sexist. I saw these themes in the earlier books, but never so strongly as in Breaking Dawn. Bella is completely dependent on other people, especially the men in her life. Also, Edward has complete control over her sexuality, at one point in the story this causes her to lie and beg in order to make love to her HUSBAND. She is financially dependent on Edward in every way, and she doesn't mind it one bit. Education is completely unimportant to Bella (something that is also reflected in other characters, which is upsetting.) I hate seeing these blatant stereotypes about women, especially when I saw how many young girls are completely addicted to these books.    Two: Racism.  I truly hope that I am not the only person who noticed that most of the non-white vampires were portrayed in a negative light, ESPECIALLY the Brazilian females. They were referred to as the \\"least civilized\\", as \\"wild women\\", and \\"scary\\" to be around. The Egyptian vampires were also cast as standoffish, rude, and willing to betray their friend Carlisle without batting an eye, in order to save their own lives.   Also, when we are inside Jacob's head, she does not make him think in a very intelligent manner. Although his diction and vocabulary made him seem very smart, or at least like he had an education, in the first three books, she seems to dumb him down a lot once we get inside his head. He also does not seem to think twice about dropping out of high school to be with the person he has imprinted on. What is she trying to say about Native Americans here?    As others have mentioned, this book presents a totally unrealistic picture of life to young women. While the books had originally been about choice and the sacrifices that Bella has to make to be with Edward, all of that is negated in this book. She gets EVERYTHING she wants, and doesn't have to lose ONE THING to have it all. A story that was supposed to be about the importance of choices ended up being a story about how in life, you don't have to give up one single thing in order for your dreams to come true.    I would not let my children read this book, and I am sorry that I wasted my time and money on it.
031606792X|5.0|I accidentally came across a couple of spoilers yesterday and decided that I could not wait for my library copy, so I bought the book yesterday and finished it about an hour ago.      I will say that it is not what I was expecting--but what could I possibly expect?  This series has always broken all the rules!      I loved the way each book revealed a more about the characters; Edward's humanity(!), Jacob's struggle, Bella's growth and evolution.  Probably the only thing that bothered me was the name: Reneesme.  Everything else works.  It does.  Bella commits to her husband, her family, her choice. And because of this (yes, because) she gains independance, strength, and the ability to protect her family.  Pretty powerful stuff.    I think a re-read is in order to let the characters settle into themselves a bit.  I was in such a hurry to see how it ended that I know I missed some subtelties but I still enjoyed it immensly.
0060531053|5.0|My wife bought this and a True Brew kit for my birthday (I know, you're thinking, \\"she rocks!\\"). Anyway, I've just started reading the book and I love it. There is a ton of GREAT information in the book and I would encourage anyone interested in brewing to buy this book.
031606792X|5.0|I've been a fan of the series for a while now, but \\"Breaking Dawn\\" tops them all! After sitting down to read the book carefully and cautiously, of course avoiding any online chatter and spoilers, I was able to form my own opinion about the novel.  This is by far the most adult of the 4 books, and as such, the average 15-year old \\"Twilight\\" fan would not begin to understand or see this novel for what it is.  This is a coming of age story, and a beautiful one at that.  To see the way Bella has truly grown since the series began is something to be proud of.  Her relationship with Edward no longer feels like something cooked up in the mind of a teenage girl, it feels tangible and for lack of a better word, real.      Stephenie Meyer has done an amazing job with Bella's story.  After all, this was Bella's story, and it is good to be reminded of that.  This was a fitting end to a girl that we've all come to know and love.  She's no longer a scared, clumsy teen but has instead grown into a thoughtful and, yes, graceful woman.  It's simply stunning!    It is in this reviewer's opinion that Ms. Meyer has done a fitting job closing one story, yet leaving several doors open and ready to be traveled.  I genuinely look forward to whatever Stephenie Meyer creates for us.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Jeepers Creepers starring Justin Long definitely scared the pants off of me. I wasn't expecting such a good horror flick, the acting and plotline was excellent. The ending still freaks me out, I love it. I highly recommend this under-rated gem, enjoy!
031606792X|3.0|I am wholly and completely satisfied with Breaking Dawn. I was surprised to see so many 1 star reviews for it. I believe people are going into this book with an expectation of what is going to happen and then being let down when is doesn't happen as they expect. I think everyone knew that we were going to get our happily ever after ending so I don't get the whole issue. So many people say that Stephenie Meyer sold out, or doesn't care about the characters, but she mentions time and time again that she knew exactly where this story was going and that she is the most important reader.     *SPOILERS*  *  *  *  People keep mentioning Bella getting pregnant so young and it giving the wrong message about teenage pregnancy, etc. Come on! She's a married woman! And Bella and Edward are two people who in no way are young souls. Also, with Jacob imprinting on Bella's child we see something SM has been trying to set up long before Breaking Dawn. The need for them to be close and strength of their friendship only foreshadowed what was to come. Ok it may seem freaky but it was established since the last book that it was possible to imprint on infants and the relationship isn't dominated by lust.  *  *  *  *    Overall, I think this was a highly satisfying book that was worth the read. I think if people got over the little details and focused on the overall picture, in addition to go into the book with an open mind, they will be completely satisfied
031606792X|5.0|I don't think this book deserves the negative reviews--why take what happens so seriously?  Though what happens is certainly unexpected, it didn't ruin the series for me.  I do think this book should be targeted towards those in their later teens--it is definitely the most \\"mature\\" book of the series.    *SPOILERS BELOW*    The biggest shocker of the book is that the unthinkable happens--Bella becomes pregnant with Edward's child.  How is this possible?  I don't know, but apparently SM thinks it is possible, and so it happens.  The vampires in SM's world are not so much blood drinking creatures of the undead, but genetically modified humans.  To me, this makes the idea of a human/vampire pregnancy slightly more plausible.  Vampire rules aren't set in stone.      I've seen several reviews that take this pregnancy as SM endorsing teen pregnancy.  First of all, Bella is married when she gets pregnant.  She and Edward didn't think a pregnancy was even remotely possible.  Of course Bella loves the child.  The fact that she's a teen doesn't make maternal love impossible or improbable.  The fact that she's pregnant with a semi-monster, however, is a bit disturbing initially.    I've also seen people comment about her giving up going to college--let's face it, she didn't really want to go to Dartmouth anyway.  Once she's immortal, she can go to school and get as many degrees as she wants.  Her situation is not a real life one and should not be judged accordingly.    Edward's portrayal in the book was a bit disappointing for me overall.  I think Jacob totally stole the show.  He has strength in times of crisis where Edward sinks into despair.  The whole Team Edward, Team Jacob debate of course becomes moot--especially once Jacob imprints on baby Renesmee (WHY the funky name?  I don't get why authors do this).  I think the people that call this pedophilia are reaching more than a bit.    Overall I think SM did a good job wrapping up the series.  The writing was as concise asever and had the same pull as the other books.  I can definitely see why she didn't want spoilers leaking out before the book's release.  If you're looking for more of the Team Jacob/Team Edward love saga, you're certainly not going to find it in this book.  If you're ready to see Bella come into her own, I think you'll like it.  It is, after all, fiction.  I wouldn't let the negative reviews scare you away--judge for yourself.
031606792X|2.0|What the hell?<br />I just finished the book and I have no idea whether I should reread it or to just put it away in a deep dark closet somewhere. I guess SMeyer's characters are no longer talking to her because if they did they would be aghast at what she did with them, all in the name dare I say to the almightly dollar?<br />Everything seemed slammed together, mashed up with a blender and then spewed out probably to the whole mass marketing of her supposed untapped talent. Bad grammar continues to follow from the other books and now, bad story-telling as well. The whole \\"give birth\\" to a blood sucking fiend has been done... alot, like as in \\"Lost Souls\\" by Poppy Z. Brite - Hello? 1980's anyone? Been too wrapped up in the filming of \\"Twilight\\" have we SMeyer?<br />Honestly, the characters become two-dimensional and all along Bella just needs to get a big ol' wooden cross for her birthday, so she can go nail herself to it like the martyr she is. The only time I felt something was the mother tug at my heart-strings, but McDonald's commericals do that too. I'm sure the Twimoms will worship SMeyer for this piece of drivel, yet the difference between the parents in the book and twimoms is the characters seem to take care of their children.<br /><br />Not impressed SMeyer, so not impressed. I think they are deal wrong when they started to herold you as the next J.K. Rowling. You won't ever be that good.
031606792X|5.0|Warning: there will be spoilers in this review    This book was a wonderful conclusion to the series.    It is certainly not a predictable story - extremely creative.  It's fantastical fiction - these are werewolves and vampires making life decisions, not humans - it's just fun.    Having both Jacob's and Bella's points-of-view was well done.  At first I was skeptical, but one I got a few pages into Jacob's POV, it was great.    There's a lot of complaining about Bella being too young to be a mother and being a pregnant teen.  I found this to be ridiculous.  When people refer to pregnant teens in a negative sense, it's generally because  they're unwed teens.  This is not the case with Bella.  And the fact that she feels an immediate bond to the fetus and then a mothering instinct makes perfect sense - especially considering her dreams.
031606792X|2.0|(Spoilers)<br /><br />Meyer created a wonderful world with her Twilight series.  Who couldn't love her characters?  Who didn't think that Edward was the best thing since sliced bread?  I wanted Edward and Bella to be together forever and for her to become a vampire. However, I never expected Meyer to change the rules of the universe the she created so dramatically.  What a deal breaker!<br /><br />Through the honeymoon it felt like the rest of the books that I had known and loved.  The characters were there and I was happy.  Then, the twist - Bella gets pregnant! A vampire/human baby?  Really?  According to Meyer, vampires could not have babies - what happened?  It was all downhill from there - what a disappointment.<br /><br />Even though it was 700+ pages, I felt like Meyer was blowing through the story.  The interactions between the characters seemed superficial and insignifigant.  I still wonder what the plot was - the wedding, the baby, Bella becoming a vampire, the Volturi?  It was as if Meyer tried to cram every possible story into one and none of them were very good.<br /><br />From day one, I wanted Edward to change Bella and then when it happened it was so anti-climatic.  It was empty - she was different but not really Bella and not really not.  And, Edward became less and less like the Edward we loved as the book progressed - such a let down.<br /><br />It felt like Meyer wanted to make everyone happy instead of writing the book that should have been written - the one we all expected.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|One of the most visually stunning movies I've seen in a long time -- it's kind of the antithesis to Inland Empire (Lynch) which is all about dark.  This is all about Light - Sunlight to be exact .. it's use and philosphizing about the effect of so much sun is quite amazing.    Yes -- a real mission would be a bit more military then scientific - and of course you don't deviate from the plan -- but, once you get past the bad leadership of the captain - you are along for such a beautifully concepted and shot movie you will be amazed.    We rented it yesterday and I am buying it today - and I'm not a collector (outside of nature docs & Surf films :-)
031606792X|5.0|If you are hoping to read any sort of spoilers in here, don't bother reading any further.<br /><br />I am not the \\"typical\\" reader for this book; why is that? I am over 45 years of age. I have totally enjoyed this Series of books.  It is not full of the \\"smut/slut\\" romance I have read in most romance or Vampiric sort of books; instead, it reminds me more of a pure romance. The type of books that Dame Barbara Cartland wrote.<br /><br />Who cares if Stephanie Meyer wrote or ended the book the way she did? Besides, Star Wars, was not well received by the critics either when it first came out! LOL And just look at the following now!<br /><br />As a matter of fact, after reading Breaking Dawn for a SECOND time, I am now more inspired to write more than ever before.....and turn it into the sort of book that is reminiscent of the romance I witnessed in my mind as I read and re-read and no doubt will read over and over several more times!
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, before reading it I was scared as to what was going to happen to my beloved characters, and I went on a wild ride full of surprises. I could not have enjoyed it more if I tried.
031606792X|5.0|Stephenie one-upped her fandom by the way she answered her questions - now they're pouting.  Bella grew up and became an adult/wife/mother/vampire in this book.  She's NOT the same as in the first three books - get over it.  This book is a compilation of love stories.  Husband, wife, father, mother, friend, lover, etc...any way you can address it, really.  If you've never experience the all-out power that TRUE love has (that it can make you do stupid, thoughless, OOC things) then you probably won't 'get' this book at all.  I loved it.
031606792X|1.0|while reading this book is WHAT THE HELL!? I was SO excited for this book and right now I'm half way through and don't even want to finish it. I've already read other reviews so I know it only gets worse and more disturbing.    What a horrible disappointment this is. It reads like a messed up fan-fiction. I can't believe Stephanie Meyer wanted to end her saga this way. How did she possibly think it was a good idea? How did her editor or publisher think it was a good ending??? It has left such a bad taste in my mouth, I'm just going to pretend the story ends with Eclipse. I SERIOUSLY hope they don't make this one into a movie. I certainly do NOT want to see a grotesque and freakishly pregnant Bella with her 360 personality change, nor an agonized, disturbed, and half-crazed Edward trying to deal with her irrational behavior.      I have two words to sum up Breaking Dawn: MESSED UP.
B001BKV9TE|1.0|Just an all around waste of time. I watched it two days ago and already can't even remember what it was about.
031606792X|5.0|I am going to begin my second read of this book immediately after posting this comment.  I raced through it the first time absorbing every amazing detail and twist and I loved every minute of it!  I was careful to avoid spoilers beforehand and was SHOCKED by some of the plot.  A great ending to a great series.  I will continue to recommend this series to others!!
0743289684|1.0|i have heard of worse stories happening in the west to non muslim women.<br />what people must understand is there is a difference between culture and religion. look back to when islam was introduced and what was happening to women and girls.  islam gave women rights that were strictly for men at that time. female circumcision is not allowed, forced marriages are not allowed, beating women and even forcing women to cover is NOT allowed. one must chose  islam as a religion by choice NOT force. please think twice before associating islam with cultural traditions that are so backwards.
031606792X|1.0|I actually cried when I finished reading Breaking Dawn.  All my anticipation and giddy excitement was for naught.    The aspects that made the first three books so appealing were forbidden love, will-they-or-won't-they tension, a good balance between danger and romance, and the dynamic of choice and sacrifice.  I saw virtually none of those here.    *spoiler alert*    Obviously, to have Bella and Edward marry so early in the book eliminates the forbidden love and the will-they-or-won't they tension.  The wedding scene was very happy and I actually enjoyed reading it.  That was about the last chapter I actually enjoyed.    I was deeply disappointed in the honeymoon chapters.  I understand married couples on their honeymoon are rarely PG, but these scenes seemed as if a nice, romantic, PG movie had been edited to show on TV at a G level.  Bella and Edward swim together and then, oh, she wakes up the next morning, having had the most wonderful night of her life.  Would it have been so terrible to describe just a little bit of kissing?    I almost laughed when it turned out that Bella becomes pregnant the first or possibly second time she has sex.  What is this, some sort of abstinence-only campaign hidden in a romance novel?  It reminded me of the scene from \\"Mean Girls\\": \\"Don't have sex.  If you have sex, you will get pregnant and die\\"    Bella, while very mature in many ways, is not the sort of character I would see with a child.  As Edward says in\\"Eclipse\\", Bella takes special looking-after.  Why introduce a baby into that mix when it is so incongruent with Bella's character?  The only reason I can see for including a baby in the story is that, once Bella becomes a vampire, there will be no more damsel-in-distress factor.  A new potential victim is required.    There was no good balance between danger and romance since there was no good romance, as far as I'm concerned.  However, the danger was also difficult to get into.  So the Volturi are coming, and we know frombook two that the Volturi are dangerous.  But the danger factor previously centered around the fact that Bella remained human.  That danger disappeared before the Volturi even think about coming. It seemed contrived to invent a new reason for them to be so dangerous within earlier chapters of the same book.  The danger always felt artificial.    And then when the danger does show up, the reader is lead to believe that a battle is inevitable, since the Volturi have created several layers of offense.  However, once Alice all-too-conveniently shows up with the other immortal, the danger dissipates almost instantaneously.  Where is the layer-upon-layer or offense?  Not to mention that the whole confrontation scene is a very slow and long read.  I was surprised every time I turned the page and the scene still dragged on.    There is no element of choice or sacrifice.  Bella marries Edward, but doesn't seem to feel too badly about it.  In Jacob's book, the reader can feel sorry for Jacob.  (The writing in Jacob's book was better than the rest of BD, but that doesn't say much.)  However, the fact that Jacob imprints on Bella's daughter seems entirely too convenient.  It felt like a cop-out.  Again, the only motive I can see for this plot line is that it gives a reason for the Jacob character to stay in the rest of the book.  With Bella married, there is no reason for him to have stayed in the story.    Another reason there is no sense of sacrifice is that Bella gets everything she ever wanted, no strings attached.  She even gets more than she wanted, with the birth of a child.  She never has to worry about the consequences of becoming a vampire, since she has this super-self-control from day one.  She is even able to maintain a relationship with Charlie.  The character of Charlie served the function of making the romance and the alternate world forbidden.  Now he effectively knows Bella's grand secret that she has been sworn to since book one.      There is nothing for Bella to worry about.  Whose life turns out that way?  The story becomes unrealistic and unbelievable.    The writing in general seemed to be different.  Scenes that should have been one-pagers drag on for several.  For example, Edward feels guilty about hurting Bella on their honeymoon.  Bella says she is fine and had a wonderful time.  That scene dragged out much longer than it should have.  By the end, I was upset at Edward for ruining the memory (that I didn't experience) as much as Bella was.  Additionally, there were few, if any, witty quips.  Previously, Ms. Meyer has included one-liners here and there that actually had me laugh out loud.  There seemed to be none of those here.  And finally, there seemed to be several, what I would call \\"false leads\\".  Jacob becomes friends with Leah.  Why was so much time spent on that and for what purpose?  I was thinking he was going to imprint on her once he saw her in human form.  But nothing seemed to come of that brief story line.  Leah is almost never mentioned again.  The J. Jenks story also seemed to be too complicated for what it turned out to be.      Overall, the book lacked the elements that made the first three books so compelling and spent too much time on non-essentials.  I think it was poorly written and I'm sorry I spent so much time and energy looking forward to it.
031606792X|4.0|Yes, there were things that I didn't like during this book.  But people, hold out for that last book from Bella.  I wasn't let down!
0307269191|5.0|I have placed this book atop my listmania group of literary running books.  Haruki Murakami's marvelously entertaining WHAT I TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT RUNNING is about his running, yes, but it also touches on other interesting ideas, including the author's affinities for music, literature, and baseball, Japanese and American:    \\"As if to lament the defeat of the Boston Red Sox in the playoffs (they lost every game in a Sox vs. Sox series with Chicago), for ten days afterward a cold rain fell on New England. A long autumn rain. Sometimes it rained hard, sometimes softly; sometimes, it would let up for a time like an afterthought, but not once did it clear up.\\"    \\"From beginning to end the sky was completely covered with the thick gray clouds particular to this region. Like a dawdling person, the rain lingered for a long time, then finally made up its mind to turn into a downpour. Towns from New Hampshire to Massachusetts suffered damage from the rain, and the main highway was cut off in places.\\"    Murakami says he took the title of his book from the title of the Raymond Carver short story collection, WHAT I TALK ABOUT WHEN I TALK ABOUT LOVE, and thanks Carver's widow for giving him permission. Murakami has translated many of Carver's works into Japanese, as well as other American fiction. He says:    \\"One other project I'm involved in now is translating Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY, and things are going well. I've finished the first draft and am revising the second. I'm taking my time, going over each line carefully, and as I do so the translation gets smoother and I'm better able to render Fitzgerald's prose into more natural Japanese.\\"    \\"It's a little strange, perhaps, to make this claim at such a late date, but GATSBY really is an outstanding novel. I never get tired of it, no matter how many times I read it. It's the kind of literature that nourishes you as you read, and every time I do I'm struck by something new, and experience a fresh reactionto it. I find it amazing how such a young writer, only twenty-one at the time, could grasp--so insightfully, so equitably, and so warmly--the realities of life. How was this possible? The more I think about it, and the more I read the novel, the more mysterious it all is.\\"    Music, baseball, literature, and running. My kind of writer.  Runners looking for a similar read might want to try Don Kardong's THIRTY PHONE BOOTHS TO BOSTON.  Readers new to Murakami who enjoyed this one might be inspired to try one of the author's many novels, and I highly recommend THE WIND-UP BIRD CHRONICLE.
031606792X|2.0|*****************************SPOILERS*SPOILERS****************************        My review is gonna be nice and simple haha.  If your looking for the story where the lead gets everything they want ya found it. Also, having Jacob imprint on Bella's daughter was a cop out. On that note I'm pretty positive Stephanie stated that werewolves couln't imprint on vampires and seeing how Jacob does imprint on \\"Nessie\\" makes no sense in my mind. She still half vampire and more so than human I would think since she's gonna live forever.  I like happy endings so I got everything I wanted except the twisted imprint thing and vampires having babys.  Honestly though Stephanie did a flop on this compared to her previous installments to the series...
B00005N6KG|5.0|I purchased these headphones at Wal-Mart about 7 years ago.  It took 7 years for them to short out.  Wal-Mart no longer sells these headphones, so I was so happy to find them on Amazon (especially after trying out 2 other pairs, both of which were in the $20-$50 range).  These headphones are great, especially for the price.
031606792X|4.0|Yes, this book wrapped this fairytale love story with a neat bow, but didn't we all want a happy ending?    I believe that this book was about fighting for what you believe in; family, a child that many don't want you to have, a way of life, to life itself (even if you had to die to have that life).     Like many, I'm sad to see the story end, but we can all use our imaginations to continue the saga in our own minds, knowing that Bella and Edward live happily ever after.
031606792X|5.0|This was a really great ending for a terrific series. I know that giving everyone one a happy ending is a a bit of a reach but honestly don't you think after everything these characters have gone through they deserve it? I mean would you really have wanted to read about jacob, edward or any of the cullens being killed, not a great way to end a series. Besides I don't know about the rest of the you but reading is an escape for me and it's nice to know that sometimes things do end in happily ever after.
031606792X|5.0|I love Breaking Dawn!  I love that it has a perfect ending.  From reading the reviews, I think that some people just can't be happy with a happy ending!  It is soo refreshing to be able to read a story that ends like a fairy tale!  I think it sucks people don't appreciate that fact!  Stephanie Meyer is a very creative and excellent writer.  She uses wonderful imagery that paints the scenery in your mind.  She keeps you guessing.  THE BOOK IS ABOUT LOVE.  Not getting pregnant young, or dropping out of school, or any of the other stupid things people have said.  I could totally relate to Bella:  I am a wife and mother and would do anything to keep my family healthy, safe, and happy.  I was touched to read something that so graphically described some of the raw emotions I have experienced being a mother.  Also, I love that in the end everyone makes the right choice.  I would hope that when reading this book, people would learn a lesson of love and humility.
031606792X|2.0|While I have been a fan of the first three books in Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight Saga\\", I have been a different sort of fan than the books were geared towards. They are \\"young adult\\" novels aimed towards teenage girls. I am a college graduate with a Professional Writing degree. I was able to let my inner romantic teenager squeal delightedly over the first three books and simultaneously able to let my professional eye critique word choices and plot devices. I found \\"Twilight\\" to be well written and very entertaining. \\"New Moon\\" took something away from the series for me--not because of Edward leaving, but because of the sudden introduction of a vampire society and Bella being whisked away to Italy. \\"Twilight\\" had been so grounded in the \\"real world\\" that the scenes in Volterra made me uncomfortable. Eclipse regained some of the solidity of \\"Twilight\\", and I'd hoped for \\"Breaking Dawn\\" to continue the unique feeling of combining an average girl in the real world and vampires.    DETAILED SPOILERS BELOW      Unfortunately, I was entirely disappointed. There was almost nothing of the \\"real world\\" in this book. The beginning of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" reminded me of one of the deleted scenes from \\"Twilight\\" where Rosalie and Alice help Bella get ready for prom. Meyer had removed that scene because it catered too strongly to her girlish desire to describe outfits and decorations. In this book, it seems she emphatically gave in to that impulse. Everything seems like wish fulfillment.   What happened to Bella's distaste of attention and presents seen in the first three books?   Gone.   Instead, she is lavished with gifts and visitors and she never seems to mind. Sometimes Meyer references Bella's dislike of those things, but she never actually shows Bella having that reaction. Bella does little more than roll her eyes, and sometimes not even that, as she accepts the fancy wedding, the honeymoon on a private island, the new cottage with its extensive wardrobe, the jeweled necklace from Aro, and so much more. It's as if Bella's own personality becomes a shadow, mentioned but never seen. I noticed that after Bella's transformation into a vampire, Bella states at what times she would be blushing, if she could. I found this a strange add-on, though perhaps it would have been endearing if this hadn't been the way Bella's personality was displayed throughout the entire book.    I have not participated in the \\"Twilight Saga\\" fandom; I have not read the fanfiction. I do, however, remember a certain term from my younger years where I read a few stories in other fandoms. That term is \\"Mary-Sue.\\"   For those who don't know, a \\"Mary-Sue\\" is a perfect character who has everything, who looks perfect, who all the other characters fall over themselves to adore, and who is completely generic in their perfection. \\"Mary-Sue\\" stories are typically written by teenage girls as wish fulfillment, where they can design a character who has everything that they want. Typically, those stories also contain bad plot devices to put the main character in certain favorable situations and are lackluster towards any details that don't contribute to the adoration of the main character.   \\"Breaking Dawn\\" has two such characters. The first is our beloved Bella. She was so wonderfully imperfect in the first three books. So charming, so average. This is what made the readers care for her. Now, she is extraordinary--but not in the sense that every person is unique and extraordinary in their own way. There is a difference between an ordinary character who becomes extraordinary and a character who is suddenly changed into perfection and given everything they could want. Her personality and her endearing flaws are gone. Instead, she is suddenly faultless. The only flaw we are given is when Bella is looking at her new, vampire self in the mirror and sees that her upper lip is slightly bigger than her lower lip. Other than that, the only descriptions we have of the new Bella are detailinghow gorgeous she is or how strong she is.   Personally, I would have liked to see the world's first clumsy vampire. Who can relate to a perfect character the same way many girls could relate to average Bella? No one read \\"Twilight\\" and decided that they could identify with Edward the most. (In regard to Edward in \\"Breaking Dawn\\", I feel like he was barely there. Merely a bland background character being pulled along the plotlines after Bella.)     The second \\"Mary-Sue\\" is Renesmee, Bella and Edward's daughter. Given great beauty and fantastical powers from the start, Renesmee is less a character than a cliché. Where are her flaws? Where are the things that make this child a three-dimensional character? (Or that even make her a child rather than a tiny, beautiful person?) Everyone loves her instantly, she'll be fully-grown in about seven years, and she has met her soulmate immediately after birth. Who is she except a device to miraculously give Bella a perfect child, Jacob a perfect soulmate, and the Volturi a perfect reason to show up again. Meyer has said time and again that these are character-driven books, but her characters faded in favor of plot for \\"Breaking Dawn\\".    Despite the idea that Bella is the main character of this book, several other characters outshine her. Jacob Black, for instance. I was incredibly shocked when I reached the \\"Book Two\\" section, only to discover that we were suddenly reading from Jacob's perspective. After an initial unpleasant reaction, I began to grow used to Jacob's thoughts and soon found his point-of-view preferable to Bella's. Here's a real, three-dimensional character. He was working, he was suffering, and he was also extremely hilarious. (His chapter titles were the best.) His reactions were all very genuine and since these books are expressed to be character-driven books, several plot points made sense for Jacob Black that may not have made sense otherwise. For example, he becomes an alpha of his own pack. It made sense.It worked because the character made it work. We were reminded that this was possible because he was destined to be an alpha anyway. His imprinting on Renesmee worked, in my mind, because we saw Jacob actively searching for someone that he could imprint on. We saw him give up on finding his soulmate, before his soulmate found him. The reader was also aware that the imprinting process would try to select the mate who could produce the best offspring. And on top of that, there was already another case of a werewolf imprinting on a child. These were all things that the reader knew could happen.   This makes the reader's positive or negative opinion on Jacob's imprinting merely that--opinion. Did you like that this happened, or didn't you? The reader does not question the logic this point (though they may question the wisdom) as thoroughly as they would the actual existence of Renesmee.    Another character that had their day was Leah. I was extremely impressed by Leah in this book. She was a minor character, but she was incredibly strong and also very real. Seth was also a genuine character, though perhaps Leah had a little more depth. Her pain and her choices--to join Jacob's pack to avoid Sam and her decision to take human form and yell at Bella--made her understandable and even likeable.   Alice also continued to impress me. Her plan and her sudden disappearance did not seem contrived, though it could have in the face of the other contrived plot points. It made perfect sense for Alice to keep her gift away from Aro, and to leave clues for Bella, the only person Aro couldn't read.   Though Alice and Jasper's reappearance at the end, having somehow magically managed to find another vampire-human hybrid child, was too convenient. It's another example of something, the vampire-human hybrid in this instance, being expressed to be unique, impossible, or forbidden--and yet somehow suddenly exists in spades.    The rules of Meyer's universe are bent for this book. Vampirescannot have children. She had made this point clear. In this book, Edward, a vampire, has a child with Bella while she is still human. How? This doesn't fit with Meyer's own descriptions of a vampire's biology and therefore doesn't make sense.   Why doesn't the baby have a nine-month gestation period? Vampires don't age, so it doesn't make sense that being a half-vampire would make the child age FASTER.   Bella experiences none of the typical symptoms of being a newborn and it's suggested that this is because of her thorough preparation as well as her \\"power\\" of self-control. This could be believable, except that her power is later shown to be shielding, and the idea of self-control is lost. In the final scenes, Bella's suddenly able to master her shielding power right at the crucial moment, when she had not been able to extend it ten feet before.   I did appreciate it that she could later turn her power off, with great effort, letting Edward into her mind.    Of the entire series, I would say that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is the weakest link. Not to say that this book isn't enjoyable. Wish fulfillment is an entertaining concept and can be very satisfying for a reader. All the good characters get everything they want, and all the bad characters get everything they deserve. However, this doesn't jive with the world Meyer has created, nor does it create any sort of substance.   This book will certainly appeal to some teenage girls, but the older readers will be lost.
031606792X|2.0|I stood in line at midnight and attended the release party...I am so horribly disappointed in the way Stephenie Meyer finished this series - - what a total injustice.
031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn finishes wish-fulfillment in a whole new, twisted way.  Not twisted in a -good- way, either.  Nothing is explained about Bella's accelerated pregnancy, the character Nessie comes off as a creepy (this is saying something) Alia from Dune (without being a prophesied genius or anything), and the whole book is hilarious all around (when it's meant to be taken seriously).  Bella comes off as creepy.  Edward, Jacob, and Rosalie all come off as creepy.  There are so many things that happen in this book that go so far off the deep-end of logic, \\"how people actually react,\\" or reality (even in a contrived, sparkly vampire universe), that it's hard to finish this 700+ page book.    Wish-fulfillment, anti-feminist messages, major abuse to the plot and characters (whatever promise they may have -had- was washed away in this book), and the sad part of it is, it's a best-seller.  There are so many other YA authors out there that write well who NEVER get the spotlight like Meyer does (did?).  Meyer lures her fans in because she captures the emotions that many people (women specifically) feel when in the throws of teenaged first love.  And, who wouldn't want their first love to be their one-and-only, true, super-human, beautiful, Byronic hero Edward?    Past that, the shoddy dialogue (\\"Forever and forever and forever\\"?  Come on.  This theme is a dead horse beat a thousand times over, especially with Bella's obsession with suicide--oh, I mean, undeath), horrible messages, Mary-Sue-ism, and the non-climax make this book hilariously undeserving of any praise it gets.

B000000WG4|1.0|Amazon, for some reason, has suggested to me that I might want to buy this.     Ah no.     If you are really desperate to hear tubular bells, can I suggest a good recording of Parsifal? It has the virtue of being, if only subjectively, shorter.
0385340567|1.0|Some of the Jack Reacher books were beauties, but more and more errors in plot and his knowledge of military, fighting, and criminal stuff spoiled a bit of some of the books.  Then Child began letting some fairly obvious New York City political views start intruding... and now this latest book is just bizarre.   I had to stop when the too obvious \\"underground deserter railroad\\" got mixed in with the too-drawn-out depleted-uranium \\"secret\\" and other weirdnesses.  Child needs to go back to entertainment novels and don't let the grip of his personal beliefs doom another pretty good fictional character, as seems to happen too often among fiction-writers.
B0017VG69U|1.0|Having already bought the DVD season sets as they came out (also having bought most of the original two-ep DVDs), and saving my favorite remastered eps on my DVR, I am waiting this time for Blu-ray.    Count me among those disturbed that CBS/Paramount isn't offering Blu-ray in this and the scheduled third season release -- it feels like gouging the fans, and I am not going along. You know they will release this in Blu-ray, it's just a question of when, and it will be sooner than later.      Although I like the new effects (as a die-hard fan since about '70) and have enjoyed the quality of the remastered live-action footage, it's not enough to make me buy another standard-def second season just for them.     My one-star rating is based on five stars for the series, minus four stars for not being on Blu-ray.
0143038583|5.0|Mr. Pollan's \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is easily one of the best books I've read this year. He approaches the subject of the food we eat, where it comes from and who grows it in a thoughtful and thought provoking manner. He follows the food chain backwards from the fast food joint, the grocery store and restaurant to our food sources. This a cautionary tale about what the American consumer eats and the industrialization of the US food industry. The book is full of interesting characters that inhabit different elements of the food chain. Mr. Pollan's writing is excellent. He has a point of view but rather than beating you over the head with it, he invites you on a journey to discovery. Be prepared to change the way you look at food. AN OUTSTANDING BOOK!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
031606792X|4.0|I would have to say that out of the 4 books, this is my least favorite, but I did enjoy it..devour it. But, maybe I'm coming from a different perspective here. I'm a writer with a world I've created. I dream of it making it to print one day. So, IMHO, with characters who are clearly Meyer's babies, she could only have played this story out the way it played out in her head. Fantasies can be far from rational...they do need rules, but you know what? This is her story...her characters....her fantasy...which she was lucky enough to get published. What I'm saying is...it's not anyone's story to rag on. She ended it the way she wanted to. Her fans don't own her story and, quite frankly, whether you thought the last book was \\"okay\\" or \\"horrendous\\" it's kind of sad to see her fans turn on her like that. I think she's a great writer who wrote her story \\"the way it happened.\\" After loving 3 books, it's rather awful to give vicious (rather than constructive) reviews of a writer you loved just because the 4th book fell short of your expectations.    However, that said...personally (and constructively!) I did get the feeling that this last book should have been split into at least two. I think that would have allowed the reader to take things in a little bit. Personally, I wouldn't have done a whole section from Jacob's point of view (although I LOVED the chapter titles! Hysterical!), but that's only because I'm still mad at him for kissing Bella. A Jacob fan might have loved this section.     As an adult, I should be horrified that Meyer allowed Bella to become a vampire...but, I actually found it refreshing that she let love conquer all and we didn't get a sermon over responsibility, mature decisions, etc.. I enjoyed having a fantasy end as just that...a fantasy. I read a lot of regular fiction and non-fiction. So when I want to read a fantasy...I want just that...a fantasy. I disagree with people who thought Bella was immature or whiny in this last book. Meyer has taken a girl who never thought much of herself, thrown her into hell on earth during the last three books, then made her giddy with happiness in this last book in the beginning and end. I think Bella and Edward's relationship is pinnacle. What teenager hasn't imagined the ultimate love connection? Meyer gives us an \\"on paper\\" example of that \\"what if\\" through Bella and Edward. Therefore, Bella was strong insisting on having Edward's baby....she had enough faith that she could do it. I mean, given their relationship with Edward, how could she allow a part of Edward to be destroyed? Not very realistic in our everyday world, no. But this is a fantasy. Likewise, fans have criticized Bella having a baby at 18. True, not a good thing...but, Bella wasn't living a typical life, here. Even if she never became a vampire, she was involved in a love affair few can attest to, with the opportunity to live her life within the protection, financial security, and care of a coven of (\\"moral\\") vampires. Different set of circumstances. She didn't exactly run off and get knocked up by Johnny Guitar down the street. I also enjoyed watching Edward watch Bella come into her own as a vampire. She showed a strength that came from inside her...in addition to that of her new abilities.    If this were my story, I would have had Bella have lose something. Perhaps Jacob, because, to me, he is a completely selfish character who anyone could stand to lose. It's true that everything did tie up a little too neat. But, I so badly wanted this series to end on a happy note, that I can deal with it. I think the birth scene was riveting. The fact that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee was creepy (and I couldn't get my inner voice around her name), but I got used to it. I got the feeling that she was asked to shove too much material into one book too fast. However, my imagination was satisfied with seeing Edward and Bella live happily ever after. If we could all be so loved!     Thank you Stephenie for introducing us tothe world you dreamed up. Thank you for letting us tag along...and thank you for ending the story the way you wanted to. All writers should be so lucky!
0786948523|1.0|I was terribly upset with the idea of online play. I always thought that Warcraft had that down. Why not leave it to the pros. I enjoy role playing with my friends; however, let's face it, the people that play this may not be the people I want to hang out with. That's just one of the many quarrels I have with this particular version of the game. Some of the other are too many of the rules that were good about 3.5 have changed. Over all, it's terrible; everything that was good about 3.0 has changed, and I believe that this big, steaming, heaping, nutty brown pile deserves to be flushed. I give it an overrated ONE out of FIVE. But bear in mind I can't give it a zero; unfortunately, Amazon won't let me.     .000001/5     P.S. I'm going to play Warcraft.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|This is my personal favorite ZZ Top album, thankfully remastered in it's original form (minus all of the synthetic crap added on the Six Pack remixes and not fixed until 2006). Everybody even vaguely familiar with ZZ Top probably already knows the merits of these songs on this disc. My main reason for writing this review was to warn about downloading the mp3 album (which I almost did because this item was out of stock). When you click on the Buy mp3 link, it directs to to the 1990 release, which is the one you DON'T want. Apparently Amazon doesn't have the 2006 Original Recording Remaster available for download.
031606792X|1.0|Don't waste your money. I won't get into details as to why, because I'm sure that previous and future posts will explain in detail. If you insist on reading it, do yourself a favor and borrow it from the library.
031606792X|1.0|I was seriously anticipating this release more than I cared for Graduation or Prom. Let me just say that the spoilers were real and I was shell-shocked.    The premise was interesting to say the least, but everyone was terrible out of character and Bella transformed into a Mary Sue vampire with no difficulties transforming to the vampire life. It was too easy. She had no slip-ups or furious rushes at the Cullens AND she acted as if not much had happened at all.    So upsetting, I cannot begin to explain.    Oh, and then we have Jacob imprinting on the vampire hybrid. How creepy is that? She's a newborn and there he goes. And then Edward calls him his 'son' towards the end of the novel. Yuck. Is Jake going to tell Renesmee (awful name) about how he was in love with Bella? So weird. And is he going to start aging because we all know now that Nessie won't.    Okay, okay, I realize I shouldn't be cutting Meyer off at the knees, but in my opinion, this was an complete, epic failure for a final novel to a series. There were a number of ways to end it that don't include this ridiculous circus of events akin to a poorly-written fanfiction.    I'm done now.    Actually, I lied. I have half a mind to find those fanfiction with very similar plots as Breaking Dawn and applaud them for being able to fail like SMeyer.    Another problem: Edward (a MAIN character) was absent for a majority of the book as was Alice. That's just no fun. It was all about Bella's martyr attitude and Jacob's creepy relationship with the former love of his life's infant daughter.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac-All Eyez On Me *****<br /><br />The statement that at least 90% of the time this, All Eyez On Me is the album blasting from the car next to you sounds like hype but the thing is...their right. Recording for this album started the day 2Pac was released from prison. After spending the last year in prison Pac had a head full of ideas; many of which were among his best and most creative of his career.<br /><br />All Eyez On Me is more than just another rap album, it might just be THE rap album. Two discs of solid work. Double albums are a rare art form, and even rarer are the good ones. This is among the best. Released during the death of the genre, it set the standard with it's release.  After 2Pac and Biggy died rap lost it's power. Everyone seemed to give in. Now it is very rare to find someone who says anything. The Game, Kanye, and Common are the few who actually say something with their music while still incorporating the club. That is why rap gets a bad rap these days. While 2Pac prophesied his own death, almost the way Nostradamus would have. He died soon after this album, as did raps golden age.<br /><br />'Ambitionz Az A Ridah' 'All Bout U' 'How Do U Want It' and 'California Love' among other tracks became some of the biggest hits and most legandary cuts in rap radio history. But it is tracks like 'life Goes On' 'Shorty Wanna Be A Thug' and 'Thug Passion' that make the album. They show the lyrical genius of Pac, the poetic brilliance of his mind.<br /><br />If it isn't the greatest album in rap history it is damn close. If Patti Smith was the poetic genius of Punk, 2Pac is her doppelganger of rap, and for that alone the mans work is worth a peak. All Eyez On Me is street brilliance. Highly Recommended.
B001BMKOZW|5.0|This album is almost like a mixture of really awesome Red hot Chili Peppers and SOAD. It is the only complete album that i have heard in awhile.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead-Hail To The Thief ****<br /><br />What strikes me about Hail To The Thief is that it is Radioheads boldest statement, and yet probably the bands all around weakest album. Where as every other album the band released would grow in a new direction, Hail just simply reverted back to Kid A and really only slowed it down. You find basically the same themes through here as you did there as well. So why is this so bold? Well we always expect Radiohead to go somewhere new and they deliberately didn't. But what is this albums greatest merritt is also it's downfall. There is nothing new here which feels like we have already heard this album before. Though at the same time, In Rainbows only took everything the band ever did and put it all on one album, and I personally feel that it is their strongest album to date, even surpassing the highly acclaimed Ok Computer. So what we have is a paradox.<br /><br />'2 + 2 = 5' with much thought put into this statement, just might be the very best song Radiohead has ever released. It's beautiful melancholy, in a fast angry gun shot to the face delivery with a soft silk screen silohuetted over it. I am aware that statement made no since, that was the point.  'Sail To The Moon' needs no mention as the track speaks for itself. 'We Suck Young Blood' and 'The Gloaming' scare the bright side out of you upon first listen.. 'A Wolf At The Door' might be the weakest track Radiohead has ever released making the end of this album perfect. Don't ask me how that works, I don't know. The fact is that everything this band does should suck, because it goes against everything that we are told to like, and maybe that is why we love them so much. In an alternate universe I believe the world hates Radiohead in the same way that we love them.<br /><br />So why not give Hail To The Thief a five star rating, I don't have a reason for that. I just feel that five is too many and anything less than four would be treason. Aside from a few hand claps thrown in nothing new is here as I said making this album feel like you have heard it before. So for that I can't give it a higher rating, and I can't give it a lower rating because all the groups other work is brilliant so it would be hypocritical to lower a rating for that lone reason. I highly recommend all Radioheads work!as I said making this album feel like you have heard it before. So for that I can't give it a higher rating, and I can't give it a lower rating because all the groups other work is brilliant so it would be hypocritical to lower a rating for that lone reason. I highly recommend all Radioheads work!
0393324818|5.0|So I'm a big fan of fantasy baseball.  And for those that are as well, you know that playing the fantasy game changes the way you look at everything.  Moneyball has the same effect.  It just revolutionizes your outlook on the game of baseball.  The \\"important\\" stats like RBIs and runs are replaced with really important ones, like OBP and pitches per at bat.  No name guys like Scott Hatteberg become cogs that make teams great.    Michael Lewis crafts a book that is engaging on several levels -- to the baseball fan, the economist, and the statistician.      Ever wonder why we give more credit statistically to a guy that bloops a single just out of a poor fielder's reach vs. the guy that smashes a homerun, but is robbed by an amazing leaping catch?  This book answers those sorts of questions.  And it does so through the amazingly in depth looks at the mind of Billy Beane, the genius that built the A's, renowned for their ability to find talent that other teams miss.      I would highly recommend this book to any fan of baseball on any level.  It's a truly great book, and one that will leave you feeling a bit like you stumbled upon a little known secret.  You'll suddenly rush and start analyzing the latest pickups of your favorite team.  You'll feel compelled to run out and follow the career of guys you'd never heard of before reading the book (and hint...they don't get on SportsCenter that often...).  No regrets after reading this, and I promise it will be staying on my shelf for a long time.
B0000640VO|5.0|I have always loved this movie. My husband and I recently went on our honeymoon and I wanted him to see it for the first time. Not one video store or library in the area carried it, however, and in lieu of joining some highly iffy online movie site, we decided to order it on Amazon. Well, we were not disppointed! The movie came in 2 days and it was an extremely high-quality item. It is packaged in a fold-out sort of case, which is a picture of Amelie sitting up in bed (cute!) and the picture is on both discs. The sound and image qualiy were great, and we are very happy to own this classic.
031606792X|4.0|It wasn't what I expected, but it wasn't all that bad. There were great scenes that really did complete the series well. It was all tied up happily, but isn't that what we wish for our favorite characters most of the time?  She wrote the Host in between Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, it makes sense that this book has a darker, slightly more adult tone to it.   As for being a bad role model, who encourages their young teens to be like fantasy characters? I mean really...
031606792X|5.0|I understand how so people may believe this book to be far fetched and unrealistic but thats why people love books so much-for their ability to take you away to places where the impossible occurs. And as many of the one star reviewers are devouted fans of the series they should have gotten comfortable with the strang occuring i.e. the plot twist of the werewolves running around Forks. So when such strange things such as Bella becoming pregnant, and Jake imprinting on Edward and Bella's daughter came as an unwanted shock I just went with it because that is why I read this books in the first place- to for a little bit be so wrapped up in the book that I'd belive in the impossible. And for those so opposed to Bella's to happy ending why? Because in a world where bad things happen everyday isn't it nice to believe for a little while that even when terrible things happen they can still turn out right in the end-even in a fictional world?
B000H7JCIW|5.0|It is an extraordinary  spectacle. Outstanding performance by Minelli, still in top form, singing, dancing.     Ensemble backing her is tops. So is music, lighting, choreography .     She was without a doubt  the outstanding \\"One Woman Show\\"  star in the world, from the seventies to the early nineties.    I also recommend buying 'LIZA WITH A Z\\", which was directed and choreographed by the great Bob Fosse.
031606792X|1.0|There was nothing I liked about this book. No, wait. I did enjoy Jacob's book - until towards the end. I feel like I just wasted money and my time reading this book. The characters were written out of character. I didn't feel like anything was right anymore. There are just so many problems with this book. Did we really need this as the closer to the \\"Twilight Saga\\"? Thanks, but no thanks. For me, the \\"saga\\" is made up of a trilogy.
031606792X|4.0|This is a much more adult oriented book than I expected after the first three. However, the characters have also progressed. Static characters are ultimately boring- no matter how beloved they are. I enjoyed the fact that Bella was ultimately the deciding factor in the Cullens' victory- without being the best fighter or other offensive powers. The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 was due to the fact that it did seem there were times when the relationship between Bella and Edward was too distant. All in all, a fun read. I'm looking forward to Midnight Sun.
031606792X|1.0|THERE ARE SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.    To be honest, I haven't even been able to bring myself to finish reading the book, though I do know what happens due to reading spoilers online. I'm just so horrified by what I've read so far that I need to take a break from it. It's corny and overly-contrived and has many \\"WTF\\" elements that make the novel seem like an elaborate fanfiction.    If you are young and idealistic, by all means, read this novel. It's clear that, generally speaking, only readers aged 12-14 could even hope to enjoy this novel - I should hope older readers would be mature enough to realize that the book is not good, and anyone younger shouldn't be reading it. I say \\"idealistic\\" because the novel very much goes in the \\"happy endings for all!\\" direction, which, based on the previous novels of the series, should have been impossible, thus making this novel the most extreme deux ex machina I've ever encountered.    I must warn away anyone that is even the least bit feminist. Throughout the series, Bella has always been a bit of a letdown for a lead female character: She allows Edward to control almost every aspect of her life, and is so dependent on him that it makes me ill. In this novel, the anti-feminism vibe is pushed even further, with Meyer not-so-subtly hinting that all a woman needs to be happy is a husband and babies.     Meyer also conveys an anti-human vibe - by the end of the novel, pretty much all the central characters are some sort of supernatural species, and they all seem thrilled about the fact. It's disturbing, to say the least.    The entire novel was just such a huge disappointment. It completely negated one of the major themes of the series: choice. In Eclipse, Bella faces the choice between Edward and Jacob and, knowing what she will give up (Charlie and Renee, Jacob, the possibility of children, college, etc.), she chooses Edward. That extreme sacrifice was, I felt, the most defining characteristic ofEdward and Bella's relationship. Breaking Dawn completely negates that sacrifice with the many deux ex machina plotlines Meyer introduces, which cheapens Edward and Bella's relationship, which, as we all know, was always the central aspect of the series.    I won't go into any more specifics, but I will say that there were just so many things in this novel that were completely outrageous. When I first read the spoilers, I didn't even believe them. Then when I started reading the novel, I was angry and upset. Now, I've joined the masses that are simply laughing at the novel - we laugh so we don't cry ;)    In conclusion: Read the book for laughs. Don't go in with any high expectations of any sort, because you will be severely disappointed.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I was unfortunate enough in not seeing this film in theaters and I regret it everyday.  I own the single wide screen version of the film on DVD, but if you have a 1080p tv go for the blu-ray version.  I honestly believed that Christian Bale was the wrong actor for the role and boy was i dead wrong.  I must say he is the best Batman hands down.  Now that would be a big statement coming from a huge fan of the comics.  I base my decision on Bale's incredible skills of performing real moves of martial arts.  for the first time i finally see batman actually use his elbows as well as his knees to take down some of his foes.  It's funny to see in the 1989 Version how Michael Keaton could just do a back hand punch on somebody and knock him out instantly.  I also find him to be a bad shooter as he literally aims at the joker with his arsenal on the bat wing and still misses.  I believe Christian Bale is the real deal and now that the \\"Dark Knight\\" is out, it's official that no one else is capable of beating him as Batman.  This movie makes you forget that there was ever a Batman film before it.  I recommend this film for hardcore Batman fans and those who are just introduced to the franchise.  I  suggest getting the dvd since it's cheaper but if you're spoiled with a HDTV then get the blu ray.
031606792X|1.0|Let me start by saying that I loved the book Twilight, and when I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I believed that the series had a lot of promise, and hoped that it would deliver. In Twilight, I was able to forgive Bella for her incessant annoyingness because I assumed, and hoped, that she would grow and develop. I also hoped that there was more to Edward than his unnatural good looks and his limited vocabulary - \\"I love you,\\" \\"You're my life now,\\" \\"I need you,\\" etc. New Moon didn't do any of these things; in fact, the only thing that kept me from throwing New Moon from across the room was the character of Jacob Black. After reading New Moon, I instantly became a member of TEAM JACOB. Jacob just seemed so much more real to me than Edward did. I loved how he had imperfections, quirks and passions that didn't revolve around Bella... which then brings me to Eclipse: I did not understand what Edward and Jacob saw in Bella: she had no hopes, dreams, or plans for her future, aside from turning into a vampire so that she can be with her beloved. She scoffs at the idea of going to an Ivy League University, and claims that she would rather die than be without Edward. I found myself feeling disgusted with the female protagonist that Stephenie Meyer had concocted. I cannot think of a more terrible message to send to preteen girls, the audience that the Twilight Series is aimed at. I also hated how Edward continues to walk on water, and how it appears that he has no flaws. In New Moon or Eclipse, I was hoping that more about his past would be revealed so that I could get more of an in depth look into him.     This finally brings me into my review for Breaking Dawn. I cannot imagine a worse way to end a series that started off strong, and then began to decline. Meyer really could've finished Breaking Dawn off with a bang, with some action and adventure, and hopefully, some more revelation into some of our characters, aside from, say, the human lives of the Cullen family. I wanted Tanya to make an appearance and stir up some trouble. I wanted Edward to stray off the straight and narrow for a while. He would've been more real to me if that were the case. I wanted Bella to be able to experience what the consequences were of choosing to become a vampire, and how she would miss out on many human aspects of life - one of them, having children. Bella becoming pregnant with Edward's child was extremely frustrating for me to read. Meyer completely contradicted herself and felt that it was okay for the rules she had already established for her Twilight world to be broken. I was repulsed with how she felt that Bella was an exception. When Bella changes, she does not seem to experience the consequences - she doesn't seem to go through any pain that the Cullen's went through during their transformation, and she appears completely unaffected by it. I hated that Bella didn't have to give up anything by making a complete lifestyle change. I also find that to be a horrible message to send: that you can get married and have a child at a young age and not have to give up anything. I think it's horrible that young girls are reading that when you make such a drastic lifestyle change, that there are no consequences. Granted, no preteen girl will ever have to make the decision between staying human or becoming a vampire, but they need to understand that the decisions you make always have consequences. Breaking Dawn seemed to completely skip over that issue.     Lastly, I am also very creeped out by Jacob imprinting on Nessie. I find it so disturbing that he is going to end up with the daughter of the woman he loves. Couldn't Jacob have imprinted on another girl, or something? That also brings me to the treaty: I was expecting a full on Vampire/Werewolf War either when Bella became a vampire, or when Bella stayed human. The werewolves would've been mad to see the Cullen's change a human, and the Volturi, I'm sure, would've been furious that Bella hadn't change. This, too, all seemed to be conveniently forgotten.     Meyer had so much potential to end the Twilight series strongly, and to deliver a great book, where there was character development and where she didn't contradict the rules she had established for the Twilight universe - although, I'm sure none of us expected that. I also hoped that this book would've sent a better message, such as, that the choices you make have consequences, and that at times, you have to sacrifice if you really want something. Instead, Breaking Dawn seems to tell young girls that there are no consequences, and that you don't have to give up anything when making a drastic life changing decision, and that in order to be truly happy, you have to marry young, and become a young mother.     This book failed to deliver in every aspect.
031606792X|2.0|Im so so sorry but this book didnt keep pace with the other three. It doesnt even read the same way.  This book DOES read like fanfic or sci fi.   I could not proudly recommend it to my friends like I do the other three.   I just cannot wrap my head around Renesmee. No matter how hard I try.  I cannot imagine Bella, who has shown zero maternal instincts (couldnt even keep her goldfish alive for goshsakes) fighting so hard to keep this child. Then Bella drinking blood from a cup with a straw? Are you SERIOUS? For some reason I cannot get past 2/3rds of the story. It was so far fetched. I also feel like it is a total cop out that Bella had very little struggle with her newborn self. She needed to loose control more to be believable.  Then Jacob; with Renesmee as soon as he lays eyes on her for the first time? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Jacob thought Renesmee had just killed Bella and now he's in love?  And Charlie is ok with the dont ask dont tell policy? He just swallows this? No.No. No. And where was Renee is all this? Sitting by the phone? If your child was so sick she was at the CDC you would not wait idly by the phone.  So many little things that added up and turned this book into just a silly story really.  There was some humor in the book, thankfully. The ending did give closure but almost in a too good to be true sort of way. This book, overall was a big disappointment to me.
B0019IB26I|5.0|John Mayer live audio version is wonderful...but is better appreciated after one views the DVD.
031606792X|3.0|*WARNING SPOILERS*    I am torn between loving and disliking this book. What really threw me off was how different this story was from the series. You can feel the connection between the first three books, but Breaking Dawn is completely separated. It's like you can (almost) read this book without reading the first three. At first this confused me, but I figured what it was that made this book so different from the series on which it's based: the maturity level. Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse are adolescent compared to Breaking Dawn. After getting used to the some-what \\"innocence\\" of the first three books I was expecting the same thing from the fourth book. How wrong I was. The fourth installment is considerably more mature and not for the faint-hearted. There is sex, blood, suffering, and violence. When Bella officially becomes a Cullen the story takes a very dark turn. Not that the first three books were dark, but once Bella said \\"I do,\\" to Edward she became completely involved in everything. We are used to the Cullens leaving her out because of her fragile humanity (therefore leaving us readers out of the loop too since we only see Bella's point of view) but this changes quickly near the beginning of the book. The reader is drawn away from the dark life of vampirism and the eroticism of abstinence to the suffering of neverending blood thirst and the hot passion that true love can create.     Oh, what also threw me off was that about 1/3 of the book was from Jacob's point of view. I found it very interesting, but I was more eager to see how Bella and the Cullens were handling the pregnancy from her perspective. Not that there is anything wrong with Jacob; however, this is Bella's story. Stephenie Meyer could have just cut all that out and she would have had more room for character development from our favorite vampire family.     We are also used to the majority of the story being Edward-and-Bella-fluff, however there is not that much in Breaking Dawn.     Overall, I still enjoyed the story. Meyer wrties beautifully (even when describing something bloody and painful), I still love ALL of the characters, and I enjoyed the happy ending. I recommend this book for people ages 15 and up.
