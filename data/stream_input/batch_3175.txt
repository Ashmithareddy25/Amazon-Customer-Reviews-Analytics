B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Excellent story about a fathers fear of being a failure with his family, and how he tried to hide it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble, what a great entertainer. I just love his tone that produces such a wonderful sound. His Christmas arrangements are fun. His band is always great. If you like music from crooners, get this. He's one of the best!
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This film will always be amongst the top 10 movies ever made.<br />On a personal note, I was visiting Austria and after all of these years, the town folk, where the wedding took place, are still living the moments when the movie was actually filmed and there is memorabilia everywhere.  It was like a time capsule and an enjoyable experience.<br />Academy Awards were given and deserved.<br />Based on a true story and one can appreciate the horrific times that the world suffered under Hitler's rule.<br />The songs are beautiful and will always be remembered as classics.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|mhm, yep, good game. I like stairs though butt elevators work 2.<br />OR DO THEY. THE ANSWER mabey. I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE DOMO A LOT, LIKE A LOT AND I MEAN A LOT. THANK YOU
B00CATSONE|5.0|Love the book. It fuelled my imagination, and brought fore the creativity that most of us forget once we grow up. Great man!!!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|A Christmas classic, love it anytime of the year.  This has become a favorite Christmas Eve tradition at our house.
B00005QBUK|3.0|Well, let me tell you.  I like the design and the sound quality, is why I keep ordering the same model.  But every one that I have had--I've been through probably five of them by now--the cord on the things is so flimsy, the outer covering begins to ravel and become exposed in not one but several places after only short use.  Even if the cord does not deteriorate quickly, one or both of the channels will go out.  If both channels are not working, then what's the use?  I realize that this particular unit is quite inexpensive, but why should the quality of a product be dependent on the price?  There was a time when manufacturers had a great sense of pride and made things to last, no matter what they charged for them.  Now it seems that everything is made with \\"planned obsolescence.\\"  My point is, even if you pay very little for an item, you still paid something for it.  If the product is so inferior that it falls apart from normal use, they shouldn't be charging anything for it.  Put a label on it that reads, \\"Caveat emptor.  As this item is a worthless piece of s***, there will be no charge to you.  Take it at your own risk.\\"  Then the notion that \\"you get what you pay for\\" wouldn't be such a bad thing.  I would be willing to purchase this model again if you would put in a word to the Sony people (if it really is Sony who makes them) to take better care in its construction, especially in the cords they use.  You asked for my opinion, so there it is.
B007712XAU|5.0|This interesting British series is really delightul for Americans (and anyone else) to watch. Although the story is fictional, it is based in the reality of British history, including English royalty. All of the characters, rich or poor, royal or servant, have a story to tell. Excellent acting, and writing shines through this set. Delightful and refressing story!
B007HJ9NBE|5.0|This film shows the courage of the young folks bucking the system and the unconventional rules that were applied upom them by a former tragedy.<br />Thoroughly entertaining, the dancing was terrific and the courage to show that rebellion is not a choice.<br />Very well done movie and is a do-over from years ago.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun.  Excellent for killing time but some levels require some strategic thought and planning.
B003L16FAE|1.0|The movie itself is great, however the codecs or region they used to encode this specific Blu-ray disc are bad. It wont play on my PC, PS3 or sony Blu-ray player.  If you want the movie find another Blu-ray version.
1594746036|4.0|This is like walking into another world, as it should be.  Very creative and engaging.  A fun story.  Recommend this to fiction readers.
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|Cute story, but not Disney's best work. The story was very similar to Cars, but the characters were not as memorable.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|LOTS OF LEVELS! I'VE ENJOYED PLAYING IT. I'M GLAD IT HAS A LIMITED NUMBER OF LIVES TO USE AT ONCE OR I'D NEVER STOP!
B00ET47USI|4.0|it is a challenging game with its multiple colums and moving figures. You must pay attention to make the right moves
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|Arrived safely and promptly for my grand children in USA.  I will not see it but my daughter is sure they will love it.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|So much missing, a book about words,but not enough of them.  Maybe I was expecting more because there is a movie coming out.  I will be interested to see it and how they are going to fill in the blanks.  This book might have too much hope in the advertising and should only be a three.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show covers everything from dirty politics to family issues. It is a show for the sophisticated adulr. The acting is outrageously good.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|A life transforming diet for PCOS sufferers. I can't believe how much better I feel & I can't thank him enough for making me feel normal again!
B0063M22QO|5.0|very good game with several playing features. Gives a variety of play options that keep you interested and is challenging
B003QS67F0|5.0|If you have not seen this film, you must see it. Make sure you have time to actually sit and watch it. Great flick! Christian Bale! Don't know that I'd let my young kids watch it with me. May be a bit much for them.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Fabulous book. I liked it better than the movie. Easy read that you don't want to put down. Very well written.

0515149489|5.0|This story really had me from the first page, Nora's writing style is unique in that she starts you off with a punch.
B002APU580|5.0|I finally purchased this DVD to add to my collection of favorite movies. I was torn between the full screen format or widescreen, and opted for the latter. I really detest the black screen above and below the video, however was concerned over images being cut off by the full screen format.  Anyhow, this is the background that led me to purchase this movie.<br /><br />I'm rather embarrassed to admit that I had never read Jane Austen's masterpiece, nor was aware of the story line. I happened to be flipping through the TV channels one evening and this movie was on. I watched and absolutely fell in love with the story and the characters, particularly that of Mr. Darcy played by Mathew McFayden. It was entertaining to see him transform from the condescending snob at the initial ball to a sexy romantic in the final scene; one of the best love stories I have ever witnessed. The movie had me and I viewed it several times on TV.<br /><br />Then, I happened to catch the BBC miniseries version one evening with Colin Firth. Luckily all episodes played simultaneously, so I spent 6 hours watching these new characters and altered story line of what I was accustomed. Admittedly, it was disheartening to watch these new actors initially . There could never be a better Mr. Darcy than Mathew McFayden, and Colin Firth did not quite fit the bill, IMO. However, by the 4th episode, my feelings gave way and I actually enjoyed the development of all the characters. Although the contrast of Keira Knightly and Jennifer Ehle as Lizzie Bennet is quite evident, I rather liked both. Additionally, it was quite enjoyable to watch a young Colin Firth (I knew him only from \\"The King's Speech\\"). I recorded these episodes to my DVR and have watched several times. Colin Firth's Darcy definitely comes off as more proud and conceited than the 2005 version, and the intimacy of that momentous kiss at the end lacked luster. However, the story line in whole still captures my heart and it is nice to go back andforth between the 2 versions.<br /><br />I happened to discover and watch a third version, another BBC miniseries made in the 80's. Since my evaluation of these movies are based upon my interpretation of Mr. Darcy's character, I must confess that David Rintoul's physical appearance was too thin and not sexy enough. I observed some differences in the 2 miniseries, from the more elaborate costumes, the enhanced vulgarity of Mrs Bennett and her younger daughters, and the more even- tempered attitude of Darcy.<br /><br />By now, I had become enamored with Pride and Prejudice. I discovered yet another version made in 1940 with Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy. I disliked him even more than David Rintoul's interpretation. I equally disliked the gaudy costumes, the limited scenes (although this would be expected in 1940), and the fact that Lady Catherine de Bourgh schemed with Darcy to influence Lizzy's decision to marry him. Although I hadn't read the book, I knew that the scene could not have been part of the original story  because it just didn't make sense.<br /><br />And so, I decided to read the book and see for myself which version was more accurate. It took all of 48 hours to complete and it is now one of my favorite novels. I must admit that the 2 miniseries most correspond to the novel, particularly the one that was made in the 1980's. Also, I now see that the 2005 version was a hurried and condensed adaptation of the book, however this is still my favorite and Mathew McFayden will forever be my Mr. Darcy :-)
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of the best animated flicks ever made, in my opinion. My kids love it. I love it. Adult humor, kid humor, Steve Carell. You can't go wrong!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The was surprised with this book. The book combined 2stories into 1. It was nice to read a heart warming story about life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game minion rush is good too but subway surfer is the first game i got for my kindle fire.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like it a lot and i didnt find any flaws. Not so many ads, and really fast a high quality downloads. Not bad at all :)
B003ELY7PG|4.0|Good book for entrepreneurs with lots of practical tips explained in short chapters. Interspersed with real life cases, makes it an interesting read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So far it works well and the activities are fun. It has not been freezing or glitching. My kids and I enjoy playing together.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|You know I really hate this app because you have to wait to unlock things. I was making a girl a purple do over and<br /><br />1I couldn't spray her hair purple because I hadn't unlocked it yet<br />2 I couldn't unlock a bow<br />3there were only 2 people

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Highly addictive game, and fun. Great graphics. And the voices sound spot on. Can't put down the game, and it looks freaking awesome on my Kindle Fire HD.  4 stars for this little gem. Recommended.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I played castleville on Facebook this is so much  better than that. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes this type of game. I
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I absolutely love Jake Brigance and his cast of colorful characters!  I hope we get to see more of him in the future.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|No spoilers here,.  Just enjoy the story!  I picked this book because I liked The Book Thief so much (by the same author). FYI: It is nothing like the Book Thief.  But it is written in an easy read style with humor throughout. I was never really sure where the story was headed, but it kept my interest all along the way. The ending was satisfying.  I would recommend this book to readers who are not afraid to accept some imagination in their reading.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is probably one of the best games I have ever played. It actually helps with your aim in real life. It's not just deer hunting you can hunt in Africa and lots of other places and animals. I highly recommend this game!!!!!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|cant find it on my kindle. kindle is not good as tablet. I received as gift, I would never buy one
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My roommate convinced me to download this game and so far I love it! It's a great way to pass time. Background music is soothing and graphics are impressive. I'll be continuing to play this game for quite some time.
B00F2362IE|5.0|The game is cool you get to run around and collect coins and other items you also get use whatever weapon the turtle you pick comes.with
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I'm hooked! I play every chance I get! The graffics are awesome! It's well worth the dollar! And I got my husband hooked now too. He bought it on Google play for his phone!
B00BATG18K|4.0|It was good but about the middle of the book it was too much detail but I still enjoyed the book. JQ
B002N8A14M|5.0|Walking and the gym.  My ipod comes with me and entertains me as I stay in shape.  This is a very durable product.  I use it everyday for years.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending. Most warned me to not read, others begged me to finish. Not a reader, but couldn't put the book down. Incredible turn of events, great description, relatable characters. Wonderful story.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game because it is really easy . I ordered the game because it is really amazing  and awesome to play the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can be a time vampire, Way addicting and lots of fun.The only thing that I do not like is that once you run out of &#34;lives&#34;, you have to wait up to 30 minutes before you can play again. If you don't wait, you have to purchase more lives and that could easily get real expensive. So play at your own risk. Risk of time and money. Otherwise lots of fun.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Kate Morton's books leave you with a sadness that they have ended... I want to return to the characters and The Forgotten Garden is no exception.  My favorite of her books was the House at Riverton, with The Forgotten Garden being second.  I recommend all four of her books if you love historical fiction with a touch of mystery.  I can't wait for her next book!
B00A287PG2|5.0|As someone who has not worked at McKinsey, I thought the book gets very close to what the firm is about. The tone is objective and honest. The discussions go beyond the firm itself and raise questions about the business of strategy consulting. I am very interested in hearing McKinsey insiders' comment about the book.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The acting is excellent. But how a society would put up with such a farce is unbelievable, and I love fiction, horror , sci fi, but this is a bit!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game, it is so much fun taking care of the horses and since I am a big fan of horses I would definitely recommend this game for horse lovers
B008PZ69T8|5.0|OH this soundtrack has some very deep and mellow music.  I have listen to it reading the books and its amazing how you want to well get into action during the song as Christian and Ana do.  Oh the red room of pain the songs he plays there are deep and very thoughful
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!  My grandfather was a child in 1927 and I kept picturing him living throughout these events while reading it.  I talked about this book non stop for weeks.  Although it is non-fisction, it reads as a character driven story.  Bryson jumps around which is difficult to get used to in the beginning, but the flow starts to make sense and keeps you wondering what was happening in the aforementioned areas.  The characters explored in this book are Babe Ruth, Charles Lindbergh, Sacco and Vanzetti, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Henry Ford, among many, many others!
B000GRUMPU|5.0|I love this movie more than the first one.  Love the people and the different story line.  Action packed and one you can watch over and over like I have.  High recommend it.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I tried some of the other drag games but they didn't have good graphics like this one. THE ONLY THINK I DON'T LIKE IS THE GAS
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|This movie is not going to win any awards, but it is entertaining.  The action is pretty awesome. And the performances aren't bad lol
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book reads so true I had to read twice that it is truly fictitious. When I started reading this book I had no idea what it was about, just bought it on the recommendation of Kindle.  As each new brilliant character was added, I became more enthralled and cut not put it down.  I found it to be an excellent read and will be recommending to my reader friends.  In the end when it says something about God taking his hands away from our eyes when we die ans says, \\" Now see.\\"  Will stick with me always.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I have waited 2 days to get on the application...  come on... I want to play the game ...hhmm...hhmm...I WANT TO PLAY MY OWN GAME
B0089LOG02|5.0|A great story of a part of the American experience.<br />This tells the story of the orphans who were sent west to be useful labor.<br />The author develops a novel setting and populates it with true-to-life accounts.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Oh mother of celestia... why does this have so much updates? It looks like a really fun game... but I can't play! When it was done updating for the original one (which took FOREVER) I had to update it again! I mean really now! It usually takes FOREVER to download updates on my kindle...so I cannot play! I can't play minion rush either cuz of updates! Plz plz make faster updates and I will give more stars.
6305428042|5.0|Every one loves this movie. You can't have been a child of the 90s and not be able to recite some of the dialog.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The best facebook I have used. Very user friendly and access to more features than other fb apps I have tried.
B00GINENG0|4.0|This is a very fun game, especially to pass the time. Tom is sooo cute! You can slap Tom to make him faint, feed him, and do so much more for him. The only thing I hate about the game is that after all of his needs are at 100 ./. You can't do anything with him, and you have to wait about 10 min. Overall, it is a good game!
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|One of the classic comedies of all time, filmed by one of the most creative directors of our age, starring a bunch of actors that I would watch read the phone book.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Superb game. Best multiplayer game ever . Can't get any better. Awesome graphics can play with you friends for hour .but irritating when cannot play when internet is needed.
0525478817|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a really long time. There is some definite sadness, but it's totally worth the tears. Awesome.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle. This game is the best game on the kindle fire.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|The music is very romantic, as Andrea's music always is, but the backdrop of Porto Fino adds so much to the overall effect. A wonderful set!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game won't let me update to london it is still in new orlens same with the picture on my home screen
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Somo of the history and the ABC of Mark C. in business. Nice book, specialy for less than $3. Light read,
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Fairly faithful adaption of a really good book. Wonderful cast and striking visuals. The Seekers are big fans if anything shiny. Love the soundtrack.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun and I don't know what you doing today and and the rest of the world you have your number and I don't know know what you you doing today today so
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This a complex and fast moving story. Reacher is his usual self, fast, smart, and trying to bring things to a just conclusion in a complex situation.
1451666179|5.0|You will love this book!  Having a &#34;helper&#34; dog and a &#34;simple&#34; dog of my own, I could totally relate!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and a great game for kids and adults. I love it and if I could play it all day I probably would!
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|Compelling story line of a father rescuing his daughter and country. Good action scenes.  Something's were a little far fetched in believability but good movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just possibly the best book I've ever read. Perfect in all ways, shapes, and forms. It really brings the characters alive, and makes you believe they're real people and just overall a really great book.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|Good movie.  Excellent acting and casting.  Mama Liberace could have been given more screen time and put more humor into her character.
B00ERIUO02|4.0|My husband loves it, but I am a bit bummed out that Prism lacks Katy's edgy, raw, often controversial, and witty lyrics that her first two albums have.  Otherwise, Prism is good pop and well-produced.  I just expected more &#34;edge&#34; from Katy.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is an awesome app I really do not see the difference in the other one but they are both great apps hope you consider purchasing either of them
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This was a great read. It was written in the manner of the 19th century authors and was full of insight about botany and Darwinian theory. It made you think about life, the origin of species, and what makes humans different.....or are they?
B0055SWM08|3.0|This is a fun and interesting game but I wish it had more levels. Finding the gems is a great added feature to the game.
B000T433CO|1.0|Thanks to this movie, he'll never watch another chick flick with me again and I'm stuck watching James Bond for the foreseeable future. It started out so good. I mean, Jude Law! Very appealing all the way through. And even Cameron Diaz was less annoying than usual. But Kate Winslet as Iris really got the short end of the stick with Jack Black as her leading man. Not that I don't like Jack Black, he can be adorable in his own way, but not in this movie. He's not that funny, not that talented, and they had zero chemistry to suddenly be an item just before the credits roll. Just skip it and watch Love Actually instead.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The characters are wonderful, and the plots are entertaining.  I can't get enough of &#34;The Good Wife.&#34;  On to Season 3!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Very different from the other two books. Enjoyable but I struggled to follow the change of character plots. I am tempted to read it again to see what extra detail I would get. Worth reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very fun, it's having more and more updates the only thing it needs is wolfs, leavers, and pressure plates. Other than that it's really fun. Me and my sibling play this game, honestly it's addictive. I would really recommend this game to everyone
B003UYUR0G|4.0|One of those movies that the critics hated for being exactly what it set out to be: a fun Summer popcorn flick.  Solid combat sequences, lovely Moroccan scenery and eye candy for both men and women: what's not to like?  If you missed it in the theatre I'm happy to recommend this Blu-ray: it has minimal extras (the 16 minute making of is moderately interesting and worth watching) but is a nice transfer with a decent menu.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This game is crazy awesome and if your a multitask person than you will rock at this game and you will want better yet need to buy the full version
B00BAXFDLM|3.0|The pages of &#34;Ancillary Justice&#34; are full of originality, imagination, and depth. So why am I giving it just 3 stars? Because the narrative drive of the novel is almost an afterthought to the development of the worlds of the Radch and belief systems of the characters. What we are left with, as a result, is an almost heartless novel--there is no warmth, and little compassion, until the novel nears its end. So while we are given a novel universe to explore, we almost don't want to for large chunks of the work.<br /><br />Initially the novel follows a familiar pattern of alternating between events in the past, and events in the present. Eventually the flashbacks end however, and for the last half of the novel or so we are left with a strait forward narrative track as the warship Breq (the titular ancillary) grapples with the consequences of her decisions, and how to proceed. (Apologies for the vagueness, but I am trying hard to be spoiler-free here).<br /><br />Amidst this, there is some pretty interesting stuff dealing with the moral dilemmas faced by Breq and the other military commanders of the Radch. This is good stuff, and powerfully explored, although perhaps weakened by the lack of a clear conclusion or authorial opinion on it all. Likewise the world (universe) building is beautifully imagined and accomplished.<br /><br />But it is all a little cold, a little difficult to relate to, and a little distant to really compel us. Until about 75% of the way through the book, I found I just didn't care that much about the fate of Breq. Only near the end did I start to feel that the author really found her voice and began to write with clarity and verve. In that sense, this is very much a debut novel, and bodes well for future efforts from Leckie if she can sustain the energy and passion of the writing in her next outing.<br /><br />So… worth reading, and probably more of a 3.5 stars than 3. But definitely not 4.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Because girls DO like to engineer their dreams with Legos, this pink packaging was more than perfect for a granddaughter!  She's gradually building quite an assortment of Lego pieces and packages.<br /><br />But the pink isn't the big thing -- that is the dreams that Legos can stimulate. For that, we have loved Lego bricks for generations. This package was a repeat of our enjoyment.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|great reading and first rate story telling by Mr Gresham again; can hardly wait for his next novel. high recommend this book for anyone who enjoys excellent writing.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this is a fun game so far. I do wish though that the prices for the buildings weren't as high and you don't have to pay to play a mini game but overall it is a fun game. ( p.s. why is twilight in her starswirl the bearded costume????)
1439152810|1.0|There was insufficient character development of the villan when the reader is first introduced to him.  The twist of identities was the hinge on which the novel developed.  I felt tht the character of the real &#34;Doll&#34; started out as innocent but then she suddenly evolves into a blackmailing, venal woman and this was not true to the character the author created in the beginning of her story.  I was dissapointed with such a long read and little character development, but the device of looking backward in time to solve the puzzle worked.  It seems to be a favorite story telling device for the author.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I can't wait for the next Pendergast book already!! It was great to have Corrie back again and I think Bowdree will also make for an excellent character in a future novel. One of the best books in the series by far.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|like it very much . great way to pass time. the weapons are great and the animals are realistic and make noises when you shoot them.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|After finding a couple videos of &#34;Pompeii&#34; and &#34;Flaws&#34; acoustic/acapella I wanted to download the album right away. The sounds are definitely quite different going from those live version to the electro pop sound you get sometimes in this album version. Dan Smith has a great voice and knows how to write catchy lyrics that you can't help but hum/sing along to. Overall it is a good album that I find myself listening to on repeat.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|One of the best stories I have ever seen on DVD. This story deserves a much wider audience than it has enjoyed.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|Love it! The whole family loves to play with it! I defiantly met our expectations and we may order more.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|If not, it's only a razor hair away. &#34;The Searchers&#34; has the wide open Western epic Man-on-a-mission theme, but it doesn't mine the depths of truth, lies and the future of the West like this film. The humor is cornball by today's standards, but the performances are by a who's who of character actors, with the Old Man (Ford) pushing Wayne, Steward and Lee Marvin a bit darker than what you  would expect.<br /><br />The last great film by John Ford, and he hits it out of the park with a film that will stand as great for as long as people are watching them. Bravo.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Jack Reacher's military background is helpful to know, particularly that which occurs to bring about his separation from the army and the reason he's hitch hiking around the country. Excellent plot and conclusion too. Jack is an interesting guy. The action was superb as usual.
B00GMONG90|5.0|Heard Pentatonix Little drummer boy on you tube.  Immediately bought PTX Vol1 and Vol2 as well as the Christmas album.  I have no regrets.  Would buy additional albums by this group.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I have been using this for almost a year now with Windows 8 with no issues. I am an editor and use Premiere Pro CC, After Effects CC, Sound Forge 10, Vegas 12, Adobe Bridge and it's also useful in a dozen other programs such as media players, file managers such as Opus 10 and Explorer and browsers.<br /><br />I wish it had a more tactile bottom surface and a dimple in the top for better finger control. I solved this by adding a small stick-on plastic dimple-circle to the top of it. This thing is built like a tank and has withstood all the abuse I could inadvertently give it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|So far I've read 14 Jack Reacher novels found them all to be worth reading I'm still hoping to see a sequel to the movie  what's nice each book is a stand alone you don't really have to read them in order
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|karl urban is very good actor,this is a  really good movie not to be taken seriously the plot is very good too
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Well acted and surprisingly deep and dark look at addiction and denial.  Acting very good although occasionally veers into melodrama.  The ending is sad and uplifting at the same time.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|This is so so I guess. Not everything they say they are. Talk about straining your eyes. Thank you but no thank you.
B00GLX0Z8C|1.0|Good idea for comedy, but poorly directed and written. Anniston is awful. Outside of first 10 minutes, writing is mostly schtick. Slapstick is predictable and childish. Had to force myself THREE TIMES to stay tuned till the end.
B001OBT3FM|5.0|Herbert Von Karajan Memorial Concert is now one of my best DVD. Okawa, the orchestra and Ann-Sophie were explendid !!!
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Simply, begins with very raw nudity.  Not fit beginning for children or teens to view.  Trying to sell the movie ?  How could this brilliant actor condescend to low taste filth.  Story line in mundane, lacking.  Try the Aviator
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I liked this game. It makes you think and think and think. One of the more enjoyable games ive played.
0060512806|5.0|My dad gave this best praise I can think of, &#34;This helped me remember how much I love reading; I cannot put this thing down.&#34;<br /><br />I picked this up at a local book store when picking up something similar, the guy there said i had to read it if i was interested in the other book i was picking up.  sure enough i burned through it and handed it off to Dad, who probably finished it last night.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Got hooked early in season 2 and have been a fan ever since.  Looking forward to the next season. Tops
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I tented to trust the good reviews but this charger is not good. The mouse does not work as well with it and lost sensitivity. Once you decide to take it off, the mouse does not work any more as the connection is often lost. I have to end up buying a new mouse. what a waste, I would say
B00902AKK4|4.0|This is one of the more challenging games that really make you think.  Not a simple ad it seems but not as hard either.  A mi d game.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Absolutely beautiful album from this very talented trio of young Italian artists.  Starts out with Ave Maria being sung by Gianluca Ginoble (the baritone of the group), next comes the three of them singing in perfect harmony, next comes Ignazio Boschetto (one of the tenors) and finally Piero Barone (the second tenor).  From the beginning to the end of this magnificent album, you will be blown away by their  voices, not only on the classical renditions but also on the popular Christmas songs sung in English.  The best Chrisstmas album I have ever heard!
B00785P2QC|5.0|very good would recommend to all. please highly with it b good young kid game. 6-12 yrs old<br />will play often. and look forward to new updates n add one
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show! Wish I listened to everyone else sooner. I love watching with no commercials on the roku device.
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|I rather enjoyed this game. Don't get me wrong for I was by no means good at it. None the less it was a challenge and exercised my brain. At his point and time in  my life ill take what in can get.  The price is also great. Thank you.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|To see the horror of war through the eyes of a young German girl, and narrated by Death, made for a compelling story. My only criticism is that the book was too long; it dragged a bit in the middle. But I wanted to see it through to the end, and I am glad I did. To see the horror of war through the eyes of a young German girl, and narrated by Death, made for a compelling story.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Waste of time, cheesy, poor acting, 100% predictable.  While I usually like movies with Will Smith and he has some very good ones over the years this one is nothing more than him attempting to get his son to break into the movie industry.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Not a movie just noise and did not flow well. This could have been a good movie, if it could have a begin and a ending
B00E7SFAAG|1.0|This was to silly.for me. Itsokay if your six years old I guess. Just disappointing to me. Thank you but no thank you.
B004KKX814|5.0|I was looking online for Beyblades.  This one is awesome.  WIns battles and is tough.  My son liked it alot.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Another waste of time even for a plane ride where you have to kill time.  If you need a refresh of the old Japanese Godzilla movies you will love it but if you thought those were cheesy you would think the same of this.
0060775858|5.0|A book every baby and young child should have. This a classic and been the favorite of children everywhere. LOVE tjis book
B009PMEEY2|1.0|This was a waste of time. Not my cup of tea.  Maybe suitable for others just not for me.thank you. Ut no thank you.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|I am such a fan of Rowan Atkinson, I love everything he does. Of course most sequels can't match up exactly to their counterpart but this had a different edge to it making it worth a look. I did miss Johnny English's right hand man and John Malkovich as a fancy french man. The writing took a little bit of a dive and used more crude humor than the first but if don't set your standards as high as the first you'll be in for a great movie night.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|More or the same, if you have already heard Live At The BBC #1. Some of the tracks are repeated, but that is OK. On BBC #1 we heard Honey Don't with John doing the lead, as he normally did. But on BBC #2 we get them doing it live with Ringo doing the lead. So apparently, this BBC recording was post Beatles For Sale. That is very cool. Incredible how great and tight they sounded performing these songs live. A must have for any Beatle fan.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|I was hooked on the first movie and hoped there would be a sequel. Couldn't wait to see it when I found out there was a number two but was unable to get to theater to see it. So I purchased this because it is the sequel and I would have spent more in theater. I just loved the action and rapport between actors, Great combination!
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|This game need more instructions. Somethings just not right.  Ut I'm not giving up yet. I think with a little time I can get this.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Good game...very addicting. Word of advice..don't use your crowns, hard to earn and needed for some special hero's. But overall, an excellent game.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|As an old Beatle fan (like who isn't?) ... over the many years since, I had always been reluctant to buy ex-Beatle albums. They just were not going to measure up.<br />But I have admired McCartney more and more over the years. I have never been to one of his concerts but have seen him on TV many times. No he can't sing like he used to, but he is out there just doing what he loves. That right there I gotta admire. He is out there recreating live, sounds that we first heard from the Beatles. Sounds that were created track by track in studio at the time. Really, that is incredible. He is a really talented guy. He can play piano like Elton John or Billy Joel, lead or rhythm guitar, is probably the greatest bass player ever, and can play drums, and the list undoubtedly does not end there.  Now here is this NEW album. I actually meant to only re-buy Live on the BBC, which I had, but lost. Now there is Live on the BBC #2. So I bought those two and, what the heck, I bought the New album...and I am glad I did. Here is 15 brand new Paul McCartney songs. The song Early Days is by far my favorite, and is just one of those that I can listen to over and over. And his singing is great, switching in and out of falsetto seamlessly. Queenie Eye keeps sounding better every time I listen to it. Save Us, Everybody Out There. and On My Way to Work are also very strong tracks, but the rest are pretty good, too. Also, every tune is unique as far as the overall sound, but there is also always unique melody in each song.  How does he do it? Thank you, Paul.
0399157573|3.0|It's jusy o.k.,it took me several day's to read this book! I was a fan from the beginning,this book is same all,same all,Kate and benson never seem to come to a place of peace,so is Lucy and Marino.I thing the show's like C S I's (wish I love)have saturated the theme.<br />I may still read future book's ,maybe.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|This was a cute and funny game. Mind you not great but cute and funny. Thank you but no thanks.
B002RI9M2U|4.0|I knew from the onset this was going to be a very difficult review to write. Before I share my thoughts on this book, I want to explain first my views on suicide. I have to do that in order for my review to make sense. But first, I have to say that what I find so utterly fantastic about this book is that every single person is going to interpret it differently – depending on their views about suicide.<br /><br />Here goes.<br /><br />Have I ever considered taking my own life? That’s a very personal question, but one I feel I should answer honestly because it affects how I felt about this book. And my honest answer is yes, I have. Once in a blue moon I still do. There are many reasons for this, which I’m not going to elaborate on. Nevertheless, there are those down times in my life when suicide fleetingly crosses my mind, and then there was that one time many years ago when I gave it serious consideration. But when things start looking up again for me and I no longer feel like life is continuously shoving lemons on a platter at me, I breathe a sigh of relief for not allowing those dark thoughts to cloud my judgment. However, having experienced times in my life when I’ve actually considered ending it all, but then finding enough reasons not to, I can safely say that I don’t judge people who commit suicide because I’ve had enough lows in my life to understand how clearly such a decision can make sense. I firmly believe that taking that final step in ending your life probably takes an enormous amount of courage. Still, there are times I feel it is a cowardly and selfish act and I just couldn’t find it in my heart to do that to the people I care about. In short: I’m not for it, but neither am I against it.<br /><br />Is considering suicide from a teen’s perspective different than that of an adult’s? I’d say, yes.<br /><br />If I could’ve read Thirteen Reasons Why while I was a teenager, I might’ve agreed with Hannah thinking she was justified in ending her life. But adult me simply doesn’t agree. Like Clay, I saw so many opportunities where Hannah could’ve reached out for help, especially with the last person on her tapes, had she sat down and listened when he called her back and tried to explain. I also felt all her reasons weren’t good enough, and although she blamed others for her eventual demise, some of it was all her own fault. I did feel sorry for Hannah for what she had to endure, but I know of kids who had survived worse things. Hannah’s boy troubles pale in comparison to some of the things you hear other kids suffer. Of course, teen me doesn’t agree with adult me, and keeps telling me that teenagers are emotional creatures who sometimes blow things out of proportion, or who doesn’t always know how to ask for help. It doesn’t change my opinion though. On the other hand, there has been a time in my life, many moons ago, when I have considered ending my own life for reasons others might consider petty. So who am I to judge her motivations, right? I love how this book is perfect for book clubs because so many discussions and debates can stem from this topic.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is a book I took my time to finish. I read it slowly, afraid I might miss something important. I honestly thought I was going to bawl my eyes out at some point during the story, or at the end of it. But, for me this was not a tearjerker. Nonetheless, I found it to be a deeply moving read and I feel it’s a book that should be read twice because there’s so much in there you’ll discover the second time around which you might’ve missed on the first read.<br /><br />***The below section contains a slight spoiler***<br /><br />The most important lesson I got from this novel (although it is something I already know), is how our actions can unknowingly have a snowball effect on other peoples’ lives. Sometimes it can be something as insignificant as a careless remark, an insult disguised as a joke, or a suggestion that plants the seed of doubt. One of the most important lessons I’ve learned in life – and which this novel reiterates – is that no matter how much we think we know somebody, we never really do. Case in point: in one of Hannah’s classes, Peer Communication, they decorated paper lunch bags to hang on a wire book rack in class in which fellow students can drop each other notes of encouragement or positive feedback throughout the year. One of the persons on Hannah’s tapes – in a childish act of pettiness – decides to steal all the notes dropped in Hannah’s lunch bag in this class. While Hannah’s going through the lowest points in her life, she becomes dependent on these notes of encouragement, but person x keep stealing them out of her bag before she gets a chance to read them, which in turn leads to her thinking nobody’s leaving her any positive notes.<br />How was that person to know Hannah’s life literally depended on these notes? That’s my point - and I believe it’s one of the points the author tries to make – that no matter what we think, we never REALLY know someone.<br /><br />***End of spoiler***<br /><br />Two of the things that bothered me, is that the author never elaborates on Hannah’s life at home, or her relationship with her family, other than saying the relationship with her parents is a little strained. Was there really no adult she could turn to; one that she trusts in whom she could confide? Wasn’t there an aunt, or a grandmother, or a cousin or anyone else she could’ve talked to? I just would’ve liked to know more about her family setup so as to answer this question. Secondly, with each tape and every revelation, I kept waiting for that ONE incident that turned out to be the straw that broke the camel’s back, but there wasn’t anything that made me think that if that happened to me, it would also make me consider suicide. If I’m correct, person number twelve is supposed to be that reason that finally pushed Hannah over the edge, but my argument here is that she allowed it to happen. She could’ve turned around and walked away, but she didn’t.<br /><br />We all have different strengths and weaknesses, and what might drive one person to call it a day, may be something another can move on from. I might not have found Hannah’s struggles reason enough to do something as drastic as what she did, but for someone else, that may be more than enough reason.<br /><br />My overall feeling at the end of this book was that by the time Hannah got to the last person on her list, she had already made her mind up about what she was planning to do, and I feel that no matter what the last person said, she was going to do it anyway. Suicide threats can be serious and shouldn’t be ignored; and I hate it when people say that person is only looking for attention. Chances are that person isn’t going to come to you and ask for help, so it’s good to know the signs. The author treats this topic with understanding and sensitivity, and I’d recommend this book to teens and adults alike. Apart from suicide, this book also touches on a lot of other hot topics kids have to deal with, and at the very least it gave me a lot to think about. Thirteen Reasons Why is a superb book which I’m glad I read, and one I’ll unquestionably read again sometime soon.r a suggestion that plants the seed of doubt.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. The graphics are awesome and the game is just very relaxing to play. Great game for horse lovers.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. I played the original game on Facebook and I find this iteration of the game just as nice. The graphics are nice. I like the quests and adventures to earn points and coins.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Hilarious. Classic Cheistmas movie. Chevy Chase at his best. Very funny. A lot of one liners to use throughout the year.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|She loved being able to get these movies on BluRay.  These were her second favorite next to the original Superman movies with Christopher Reeves.  These Indiana Jones movies are great (minus the last one).  I am glad that some people can find all their happiness in life in a movie series and miss the importance of human beings, all together.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun challenging and addictive my 5year old sister won't stop playing it!! I've made it to2034 coins!
0446310786|5.0|i need it for my class. it is small, very easy to carry with. and it is light. love it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have not read a king book in a while but he used to be my favorite author.  I turned to dean Koonze and loved all of his books.  I spent twenty minutes deciding between another Koonze or this new book.  I made the right choice.  This book was as enjoyable as any book I have read.  If you keep the pages no .ore than 6 hundred I am back!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps your attention. Can be a little challenging but fun.<br />Solving the games make you think and problem-solve.<br />Try it.
B0084B0656|5.0|G.K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy is probably THE great masterpiece of Christian apologetics.  To the uninitiated I might recommend first reading C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity.  Once you've digested that take a stab at Orthodoxy.  Orthodoxy was a book that profoundly influenced Lewis and led to his Christian conversion.  If you'd asked Lewis which book of Christian apologetics to read, it's likely he would've suggested Orthodoxy.<br /><br />One of the key insights Chesterton had was that before modern readers can objectively consider adopting the Christian dogma they need to understand their CURRENT dogma.  Most moderns don't even recognize they have such a dogma , but they do: it's scientific rationalism and it blinkers reason.  Most apologetic works ignore this most fundamental point.  Chesterton, refreshingly, grasps it completely and makes point that most moderns have never before considered.  If you're searching for answers, READ THIS BOOK.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|what filth. I could not finish it. I don't have thirteen more words for this raunchy book. it is sick!
0553801473|5.0|Loved it! Waiting for the next book in this series! Come on Mr Martin! Get writing! Please! 5 Stars! Must Read Series!
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|The best packing I've ever seen. A very complete array of versions of the movie... but not &#34;Director's Cut&#34;, sadly. Anyway, I still love it.
B00B4RP0OO|5.0|I have downloaded properly formatted movies to my Kindle Fire HD that could not be played using the video player that comes with the Kindle Fire HD.  This a app has had no problems playing any of my downloaded movies.  It presents the list of movies (or pictures as it allows for viewing either) using images instead of file names.  This makes it much easier to find what you are looking for.  This is an absolutely excellent video app and I highly recommend it!  5+ stars
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great book. Even better than the first. Cannot wait to read #3 in this mystifying and terrific series. Thank you Cassandra for a great getaway.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I do not always like Stephen King but in this one he has re-demonstrated his strength as a story-teller. Once I got into the book it was a page-turner.  I also enjoyed the extra material at the end - I got to see a short video on my Kindle that I can't imagine seeing in a traditional book (but technology can surprise me!)\.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun!!! I love it.. You should come out with more realistic horse games. Hope u all love this game it's really amazing...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really nice game!!! I enjoy! Very funny and addictive game. From 8 to 90 years... I will advice my friends to try it.
1439102449|1.0|What a disappointment.  I forced myself to finish this book, and it was a chore.  I didn't care about the plot or the characters.  I just wanted the book to end.  Don't waste your time.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|my grand-son. thinks this is so funny and enjoys this one so very much.  I am proud of the one that he choses.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|This will provide fun, and creativity, and expectation, all through the Advent season for a 4 year old granddaughter.  Way to go, Legos!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Variety of difficulties. Easy to understand. A bit too long if you are looking for a short game. Overall, it is good.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Both my daughter and I read it. It has a great message and it was awesome for discussion. I've read it with students in my class as well...amazing conversations.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Another fine one for my grand-son. I didn't think face book would be of interest to him until he chose to get it.
B0041CGP02|5.0|This is a Great collection.  I can't say I dislike any thing on the disc.  I would but this again.  Have fun listening to this one!!!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|This was one chosen for our book club. Just wasn't the type of book I enjoy. My pre-teen grandson would have probably liked it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My husband and daughter love this game, they both beat the first one and begged me to get the second one. I couldn't say no especially when I found out it was free.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|My daughter and grand-son are constantly fighting over this kindle fire since the video camera.  It is the best thing I could have bought for my grand-son if he could ever use it.  He love, love, love it.  Since the kindle fire, his grades has gone up and he has been in the news papers 3 times for his academics and is only 5 years old.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is a lot of fun but I wish it didn't take so long for the lives to rebuild. I sometimes hey tired of waiting
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!! Im making a roller coaster when 0.8.0 comes out till then I'm still building!
0804161380|5.0|This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.<br /><br />My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.<br /><br />I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|For Granny's little boy. This is the best thing that I could have done for my grand son. He's happy and so an I.
B008MM9630|4.0|Easy and relaxing. Fun. Good graphics and fun little quests to do. I like how your friends can help but not as extremely dependent on them like other farming games.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Simply the amazing story of an amazing life ... a human life! The book struck a good balance of accomplishments and Steve's character. After reading this I understand more about the products that I have become so intuitively connected with.  It is inspiring to read about about someone who wanted to put really cool stuff into the world and had the focus and ability to pick likeminded individuals to make it happen.
B00DMKFN34|4.0|I always have a hard time reviewing Blu-rays. It's hard to draw the line between reviewing a movie and reviewing the disc itself. Because the discs all work great, the case looks the same as every other Disney Blu-ray case (which is a good thing, they are always high quality), and the movie makes for great 3D reference material on my 3D TV and 3D projector.<br /><br />But when you analyze the movie itself, it is quite disappointing. It's hard to believe the non-Pixar-labeled Disney movies like Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph can turn out so good, but then this spinoff of Pixar's great Cars world turned out so poor. Simply put, the story is as generic and predictable as you can get, and the characters are poorly developed and highly forgettable. The humor is geared to children instead of to everyone, which is why I usually love Pixar movies. They really should have waited on this film until they good get the talent of the actual Pixar studio to be more involved. But since my wife and I are big Disney fans, we collect every Disney animated Blu-ray regardless of how good or bad the movie is.<br /><br />Great packaging, amazing video & 3D quality/presentation, disappointingly generic movie plot/story.
B00886XQO0|1.0|This headset is not worth your month if you care about chatting with friends. The game sound is great, don't get me wrong, but the chat quality is absolutely atrocious. The mic barely picks up my voice and the voices of others sound terrible too. I've only had this problem with a PS3. If you get the headset and don't experience this problem, good for you.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|There are several good reviews about different parts of the book, so to save from slipping spoilers I won't go into details.<br /><br />That said, Brandon Sanderson did a great job with completing this story and I don't think anyone besides RJ himself would have done better.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Riveting. True to the lone nature of the sport. It reminded me that I have to get back on the trails. I was an avid trail runner in California over beautiful ridge lines and forested watershed paths. Between relocating to a relatively flat area on the East coast and a busy work schedule , I left my trail running behind me. Now I am actively seeking challenges in my new domain.

B003K16P3M|1.0|This book is an insult to anyone who values chastity, marriage, children, and other people in general. Like someone has said before, it is a feminist book gone bad and it is shoving a twisted agenda down your throat. The author promotes pre-maritorial intimacy continuously through out the book. She presents this as okay saying that you have nothing to lose. Um, no it's not okay to go around and have relations with whoever.It's wrong! As for having nothing to lose, what about your dignity and chastity? But I guesse to the author this doesn't matter because according to her, you are allowed to do whatever you want whenever you want so chastity should not be valued as it is a restriction. As for dignity,well you only have that if you're good at hurting people because otherwise no one will respect you because respect is fear and allowing you to do whatever you want, according to the author. Marriage is not portrayed as a wholesome union between two people but, rather a cage from wich no one escapes. She portrays it as surpressive because, again, it does not allow you to do anything you want, namely sleeping around. As for children, why there just useless sniveling things that tie you down with cries of, &#34;Mama!&#34; How can the author just say that that small being to which you are the world is just some useless meaningless thing. Does she not see the value of children! Does she not see that happiness is not in taking but in giving! Rather than a good message being promoted the message of 'I should be allowed to do what I want because as a woman only my opinion matters' is being pushed continuously throughout the book. I don't understand it. It seems as if the author is using this book to tell people that she should be allowed to do what she wants and then portrays it as her being feminist. Like someone said before, feminist book gone bad.<br />What I find the most shocking is that this book is being force fed to teenagers. Teenagers who are the future. This world she has created will soon become ours unless someone tells these young people that to always do whatever you want is not right. It's wrong. You should be chaste. You should value other people. You don't need to always get your way.<br />For these reasons I give this book only one star and do not recomend it to anyone.<br /><br />I am not claiming to be perfect for we are all flawed beings in search of perfection. I am not forcing my views on anyone but merely showing the other side of the coin.

0812982622|2.0|A Pulitzer Prize does not a good book  make! I am half way finished and am uncertain that I can read the other half. It is tedious and BORING! If this wasn't \\"Black  Friday\\" I would go out and buy another book to read. This work of fiction is out right painful with no plot to make reading it somewhat interesting. I am sure that Adam Johnson is a gifted author, but I find his style monotonous, to say the least. I would be hard put to choose between a sleeping pill and this book. Both have the same affect.

I started the download the other day. And while it's downloading it uses up so much memory that it slows down my kindle. I would like to delete it but I have to wait till it stops downloading first. And every time it gets done downloading, I can't play it because it won't launch. Never attempting to download this again.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|An incredible story which kept me (and left me) breathless and sobbing from its insight into human nature and poignancy.  I know it's a clutch-to-my-heart book when as soon as I reach the last page I turn to the first page to start over because the thought of leaving the characters is just too unbearable.  The emotional qualities of the narrator of the book is sheer genius.  I read a lot of books - this one is exceptional.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great DVD.  Also if you haven't read the book I would advise that first.  Follows the true history of John Adams and how our country was started from his point of view.  Definitely a must see.

B007R11DKQ|5.0|Stardust is pure fun from beginning to end and I'm giving it a fifth star because of its delightful ending. The acting is above average, the characters are engaging and the story held my attention from beginning to end. The special effects are extremely well done, the plot is above average, as is the humor; which is too often lacking from such fantasy productions. Until I watched this movie I had no idea Robert De Niro had such a flair for comedy. To put it mildly, he's absolutely hilarious.  The other reason I love this movie is that it's absolutely clean. No graphic sex scenes, no offensive language and, above all, no gratuitous gore or violence.

0439023513|2.0|*spoilers to follow, including end of book spoilers. Though not on who the protagonist ends up with, I couldn't care less about that. Major spoilers come in point 3*<br /><br />It is impossible to talk about what is wrong with this book in detail without spoiling parts of it. But first, lets get into my expectations of what this book would be before I read it; to see if you are looking for the same type of novel as I was. As a fan of the first two movies, I had to jump into this book in order to read the final chapter of the trilogy. The films had me primed for an incredible action adventure, how will our strong heroine deal with a real war? How will she handle leading a full fledged rebellion? Will the Capitol be taken, or will the author have them triumph ala Oceania in 1984? After the dark and mature tone of the first two books, I didn't assume the answer to that last question.<br /><br />Instead, it seems I should have judged this book by its cover. Specifically, the part that reads &#34;young adults.&#34; It's an utter mess that failed to meet any expectation I had for it.<br /><br />1.Katniss acts like a spoiled American 12 year old (yes, I am aware she is 17). She is indecisive, ruled by her petty emotions, and has no interest in the main conflict of the book. The entire book is given from her POV and she spends most of it crying. Instead of leading the rebellion, she is put into uncontrollable panic attacks for the smallest of causes. For example, Gale might make a snark remark, and she is off weeping in a broom closet. I could have put up with this for the first few section of the book. I tried to accept it as part of a character arch, Katniss is broken and it will take some time for her to find herself and become the leader she was in the hunger games. But that never happens. While presumable thousands are dying, she is focusing on figuring out if she loves Peeta and Gale, or with playing games with her cat. The rebellion, logically, sidelines her into nothing but a figurehead. You must now follow Katniss as she goes on photoshoots for propaganda purposes for the majority of the book. And even at this, she barely succeeds, at several moments acting like a spoiled child in from of people she is suppose to inspire. The majority of the book centers around this question: can Katniss keep it together so she can make a nice propaganda film?<br /><br />Does this sound like the kind of book you expected? I have no clue what made the author think that readers would enjoy reading about this plot. My best guess is that she had no clue how to portray a war scenario, and so she simply refuses to...and you are stuck with a diary of an emotionally immature 17 year old who acts much younger than people her age. The same person who use to be strong,a killer and hero for millions.<br /><br />2. The Capitol just collapses with token resistance, and no major battles are described. As mentioned before, because Katniss's POV is your POV, and all she does is worry about the most inane of issues, you get no sense of the war because Katniss has nothing to do with the war. How does the book describe what happens? In briefings. You know the rebels win districts because Katniss is told districts fall, with no reasoning or descriptions of any battles that must have taken place.In one scene, Katniss appears at a briefing and is told that the rebels now hold all of the districts besides 2, just because Katniss made some propaganda video. That's it. The Capitol has gone from an oppressive government ruling almost the entire territory of the United States, to what is just the District of Columbia and a handful of states. In one sentence. With no tactics described, no details of battle. Its just &#34;oh we captured these places because we believed&#34;. The entire book is like this. Even towards the books climax, when Katniss leads a team into the Capitol without the consent of the rebel group, the war refuses to come into focus. Instead she dodges some patrols, outruns a pack of monsters that kill a few of her group (but none of the death scenes are memorable or, quite frankly, covered in the detail they should have been for the people who do die),Katniss then tries to figure out how to get into the President’s mansion but all of a sudden, before you can blink, the rebels have taken the entire city and are marching onto the mansion grounds. So there was no point to Katniss's mission. The rebellion can and did capture the city without her, beating Katniss herself to President Snow’s home. Meanwhile, for all the book portrays, Snow has done nothing to prepare. There is no grand plan, no counter attack, no masterful turning of the tables. I kept on waiting for something in the book (the entire book, not just these last few chapters) to show that the Capitol can seriously fight back. That Snow might win. That the rebels have any chance of losing the war. Instead, from beginning to end, the Capitol folds like a deck of cards. No big fights or strategy is relayed to the reader. It seems all that Panem had to do to win freedom is merely attempt to rebel and they would have succeeded. How in the world did the Capitol win the first war? What kept the Districts held down for so long? Going by just the book, it appears the Capitol never stood a chance in hell at suppressing a rebellion.And how interesting is it to read a story where the rebellion clearly has the upper hand for the entire war? This is a work of fiction, and the author chose that her evil empire should pose exactly 0 threat.<br /><br />3. The ending. A special point of criticism must be made for it. As mentioned before, the Capitol is taken with barely a fight. Katniss takes no part in it, she might as well be thousands of miles away.  The final act in the war is children being amassed in front of the President’s mansion to act as human shields. A bombers appears and drops bombs among them, and a major character dies. It does not make sense for either side to conduct these actions, President Snow has no reason to kill the only thing that might protect him from the rebels, and the rebels have the war won. It is in the interest of both sides to keep those children alive, and yet one side or the other slaughters them. This would be a minor gripe except for the fact that a major character dies in these unexplained and seemingly illogical events. Then the following happens:<br /><br />Katniss tries to figure out which side conducted the bombings, but is distracted because someone brings up one of her lovers and she again goes to cry in a closet. The investigation is never resumed, Katniss never makes up her mind what happened, and we never figure out who dropped the bombs or why. Katniss and the victors (of the hunger games) then vote to subject innocent children to participate in a new round of hunger games, simply because the children are the offspring of citizens of the capitol. The main character, who had spent large sections of the book arguing with other people in the rebellion that hardened Capital targets should not be bombed because people may die, now votes for recreating of the exact same institution that she originally rebelled against.  She is then given the opportunity to kill Snow in a public execution. Instead of doing this, she kills the President and leader of the rebellion who had just overthrown the capitol and returned America to its democratic institutions. For no reason.<br /><br />Instead of being executed, Katniss is let go and allowed to be free. There is no punishment for her crimes, and she lives in peace and harmony in a free world that she did little to help bring about; while the character who led the rebellion instead of Katniss rots in a grave.<br /><br />Did the last few paragraphs make no sense? That is exactly what you will feel as you read these final pages. Think I must be portraying the book wrong? Give it a read then, but you have been warned.<br /><br />Two stars because I did finish the book, even though I was highly disappointed. At the moment of this review I can't think of a bigger anti climax. The evil government in the movie Equilibrium went down with more of a fight, and that ending was at least coherent.<br /><br />I went into this book having enjoyed the past two films. After reading, I don’t even think I want to see the third.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Just finished Twin Moons in a few days. It was good, I did miss though the hidden objects portion of the  game but all in all it was fun and interesting.  A little &quot;pricey&quot; for me but wanted to continue game.
0316204366|4.0|The Kindle version of the book is so cheap, it is hard to argue this book isn't worthwhile.<br /><br />This book really has two main points.<br /><br />The first is David beats Goliaths far more than we presume. Goliaths are never as strong as they seem and Davids are never as weak as they seem. Everyone (in business every organization) has its strengths and weaknesses. If you can make your opponents to play to its weaknesses while avoiding its strengths, you can have a better than fair chance to win even if you are a vast underdog.<br /><br />The second is the remarkable data on the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) graduation rates across various universities. The graduation rate is the same across the board, regardless of the quality of the institution one attends. A computer science major in Harvard have just as much chance of graduating with a degree in CS as the same CS major in no-name state university. Just as importantly, a CS major in Harvard have just as much chance of dropping out (or changing to non-STEM major) as a CS major in no-name state university. This is despite the fact that a CS major at Harvard is probably far more talented and knowledgeable than even the best no-name state university CS major.<br /><br />So what the moral here? If you want your children to graduate with a STEM degree, then consider sending them to lesser schools where the competition isn't always top-notch. Not only it will increase their chances of graduating with a BS in STEM, but it will also increase their chance of attending a far more prestigious graduate school because of easier GPA.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Two main topics were very interesting to read and understand.<br />2)Variety of interesting facts and tidbits spread throughout the book.<br />3)Engaging read with good prose.<br /><br />Cons<br />1)The book definitely loses much of its luster in the 2nd half, which was filled with boring and routine prose as well as subject matter.<br />2) What is this book about? I am not sure. It was fun book to read but I can't say the book has a firm central focus.book about? I am not sure. It was fun book to read but I can't say the book has a firm central focus.
B00BV2LY1U|4.0|A family of four is brutally murdered in rural W. Virginia, and Federal Agent John Puller is assigned to the case. He is sent by himself to work with the local police agency, making him wonder why - why is this a Federal case, and why does not have any further backup? The novel, filled with subcontext and intrigue, becomes more and more mysterious. The 'routine' murder ends up linked to possible nuclear terrorism. Although the novel is over 500 pages, I couldn't put it down. Fast-paced and compelling, I was engaged until the very end. Baldacci does it again!

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I will never pay money for this. Game constantly pushes you to do so. The waiting for lives is one example, or they make levels so difficult that one will finally get so frustrated you will pay just to get off the level you have played 100 times.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Fun action, but the typical superhero inconsistencies that make it difficult to really enjoy. Without spoiling it for others, if one casual hit from Superman can blow out a multi-foot section of a spaceship, shouldn't it do the same to a portable spacesuit? If getting hit with a girder hurts, shouldn't crashing through a girder filled building hurt too? And, others (that would spoil the show).<br /><br />Acting is great. Plot is great. Elements of story require too much suspension of disbelief.

1434404374|5.0|Having read most of Agatha Christie's mystery novels as a girl, I thought when I read them again as an adult, would find them too simple and perhaps not as well-written as I remembered.  Quite the contrary.  Christie is an excellent writer as well as a captivating storyteller.  In this first mystery novel which Christie wrote in 1920, we meet her eccentric Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />Narrated by Colonel Hastings who recently met the dandy detective, and wishes he could be a detective, too, we find the victim of the murder has numerous possible suspects who would benefit by the death.  I love reading these Golden Age mysteries to go back in time to the 1920's to feel what it was like to live - or die - back then.<br /><br />For a first novel, this is extraordinarily skillful.  Christie's talent is evident at the beginning.  If you want to read a quintessential British mystery, and begin with Christie's first, this is an apt place to start.  You can sample the first pages by clicking on the book cover at the top to see if the story interests you.

This seems to be a Harry Potter knock-off: talented boy shows up at school, thinks he knows as much as the teachers know, makes enemies among the teaching staff and the students, but against all odds roams around fighting the bad guys and winning.  But Harry has Hermione and there are amazing women teaching at Hogwarts.  The only main female character in this book is a helpless waif who needs constant rescuing by our young hero.<br /><br />And in spite of all of that, I can't put it down.

They make this watch to compete with the lowest pricing in the world. The 7S26C movement isn't elegant, but has a solid reputation. No battery required, ever. In general, it can be expected to give ten years of service without any maintenance.<br /><br />My watch arrived quickly and in good order, although the strap had been installed with the buckle side down (at 6 instead of 12), but that was easy to fix. After setting, I've checked against a WWV adjusted clock. It runs -2 sec/day when worn 24 hours. If left flat on its back, it gains about 6-10 seconds overnight. After seeing this, I now take it off every few days and let it catch up. After 26 days of use, it is +1 second this morning. Note, this watch is &#34;non hacking&#34;, so when you pull the stem out to adjust, the second hand keeps moving. This is actually a benefit if you need to change time zones for a few days. To stop the second hand, you need to apply slight torque on the stem. Tricky, but you can get the second hand to stop, without moving the minute hand if careful.<br /><br />&#34;Chronograph&#34; certified Swiss watches are required to meet -2/+6 seconds per day, so my watch would meet that testing.<br /><br />I recall once waiting for a table outside a restaurant, a well dressed man asked me to give him the time. As he adjusted his expensive looking watch, he smirked and asked &#34;do you know how to tell the difference between a real Rolex and a fake?&#34; and the comeback was &#34;the fake is the one with the right time&#34;.<br /><br />The accuracy of even very expensive mechanical watches is not as good as a cheap plastic quartz movement, but this type of watch can perform quite well if you pay regular attention to how it runs and wear it daily. It's the only mechanical watch I own, but I am glad to  own this one. Google searches onthis model number will show you - it has a very well regarded mechanical movement, comparable in accuracy to just about any on the market. Not a piece of jewelry, but it is nevertheless stylish and good looking in a retro/classic way.<br /><br />The band is comfortable - woven to allow some softness. The thickness of the watch is actually 10.5 mm. The 37 mm case diameter is moderately sized, not as large as the chunky discs in current style. If you have thick wrists, you may want another model. There are larger variants with the same movement. There are a great variety of 18 mm &#34;NATO&#34; straps that can easily be exchanged.<br /><br />I typically don't rate anything a 5, but I'll do it here. I'm totally satisfied.
B0058VW36U|3.0|Fun but HARD!! Don't get me wrong it is fun ,but I sometimes think  of  bad  things to  say  because it is  SO  HARD!!!  Other than that  its a nice  game.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I have really enjoyed doing puzzles on my kindle fire. I like being able to pick my level of difficulty.
B00ESNE696|5.0|a very interesting plot.  I enjoyed the first four season.  a good idea to repeat it on prime in case I am not at home to watch it on Sunday nights
B00AREIAI8|5.0|. This app has amazing graphics. And horse lovers of any kind. This app is totally amassing. I would recommend this app to everyone.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The book was a bit rushed feeling at the ending. Although I did not like the ending one bit, it is understandable in the lessons it helps to teach.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Both my three year old enjoy playing this. We take turns and watch the other play. He loves all the locations he can visit and things the minion can do.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|This story is all about paternalistic societies. Societies ruled by men where women and children are mere pawns in the male ego aggrandizement game. I'm sure the brutal treatment on display is not at all unusual in the place and time depicted in the film. The cinematic aspects of the film are very impressive and compelling. The acting especially by the children is astounding. The film took 10 years to produce and over 5000 children were reviewed for participation. This is a drama that has much to say about human history and our common suffering.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is possibly the most enjoyable Science Fiction tv show since Battlestar Galactica. It is has a great mix of action, drama, and humor. Also unlike other recent SciFi shows set in post apocalyptic settings people are dirty, bloody, and clothing is torn and tattered instead of people looking like they just left the salon. That little bit of realism is just icing on the cake.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So far I am really loving everything about this app. I am impressed that I can sync. all of my notes between my devices, which makes everything so much easier and accessible!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I decided to do away with cable and just rely on downloading the shows that I want off the Internet.<br />As a result, for the cost of one month of cable, I can watch all shows that I'd  watch all year, and I can down load onto my TiVo, watch on my iPad or anywhere else I might be that I have a computer and Internet connection.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|You know, I don't recall ever hearing the words &#34;margin call&#34; in the whole movie. The characters failed to explain what the real problem was in all of the opportunities they had in the movie.The big boss asked about the problem, but they just kept mumbling an answer. I think I understand the movie, but I thought the ending was terrible. If the target was the people who understand margin calls and MBS, then it would be a small group of people.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great app. I can upload pictures , statuses as if I were on a computer works the same. There are a minor problem. The notifications doesn't pop up as quick as it would usually. Other then that it is a good app
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good story. Grisham has always satisfied his readers with story line and locations. The southern area  comes out in this book.
0345803507|5.0|I got the trilogy for my wife last year for Christmas... she devoured the book,  then gave it to her 85 year old mother who also devoured the book, and now I believe it's gone to another woman family member. Well I guess it's keeping so many people busy, it must be a good thing! Personally, I tried to read the first volume myself and it struck me as all little bit racier than a Harlequin romance... Not really my cup of tea. Well, it might  not be everybody's cup of tea, but 90 million women can't be wrong...

B0036S4B6M|5.0|If you seen the Netflix series, you might want to check this book out. Of course as a lot of series based on books are, this runs a little different than the TV series... If you read the book you'll see what I mean... Slightly different story, (and probably more realistic) and no less riveting... A really fast read.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I've seen season 1 - excellent, and I just finished watching season 2 - Outstanding!  The creators of this show is wow!  Creepy, scary and unpredictable.  The actors are fantastic and what I love most about the American Horror Story each season is different.  Great collection to have on my shelf.

B00D3ZJVJK|5.0|Tomorrowland 2013: Arising Of Life caught my attention due to my previous enjoyment of the 2012 series.  Additionally, I stumbled across the official Tomorrowland music channel that is on youtube. Their official youtube channel is a perfect place to visit if you would like to hear extended samples of the songs available on Tomorrowland 2013.  Tomorrowland 2013: The Arising of Life is a two disc (double cd set) that has 26 tracks on the first cd and 15 music sets on the second cd.  My personal favorite from this collection is Like Home by Nicky Romero & Nervo.  However, many more gifted musicians are featured on this collection such as Zedd, Martin Garrix, Alesso, Armin Van Buuren, Trevor Guthrie, Hardwell & Diro feat. Bright Lights, Yves V and more. A complete track listing is currently available on Amazon Germany.
B000050HTO|5.0|,Exactly what the title says – five stars... If you've ever wanted to own a Bob Dylan album and don't have one this is probably the one to get.
B00G3HSF7O|5.0|very good movie with a story line set in space/future but with absolute relevance to present day disparities.  although the district 9 guy was not as well utilized as he could have been.

B00FAVRFXE|5.0|The Day Of The Doctor features both Matt Smith and David Tennant who unexpectedly collide with each other in this episode/film.  There is also a serious meeting with their past incarnation from their homeworld (played by  John Hurt). They are important to dealing with shapeshifters who seem to want to invade the earth.  All three men do an illustrious job of collaborating together in their roles as time lords who must deal with both their home world of Gallifrey and the shapeshifters.  It was a good idea to have Bille Piper return. Billie Piper and Jenna Coleman also give strong performances in their roles as vital helpers to the Doctor’s personal evolution (Coleman in the companion role and Piper as a powerful interface of a superweapon).  Parts of the plot involve returning to the time era of Queen Elizabeth.  I must refrain from saying more out of consideration for those who have yet to see The Day Of The Doctor.  However, this is a thrilling science fiction movie that plays with the idea of what can happen if one is given the chance to see their future selves materialize before them.  The website of bbcamericadotcom contains further details on The Day Of The Doctor and the actors/actresses who are also part of the film.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Instead of watching the DVD. I watched this on cable and rather enjoyed it. One thing,it wasn't on the same level as the first three hobbit movies, but still this seems to me as a prequel to the first three movies. Well, take my comments for what it is and go from there.

B00FAT9W0A|5.0|The Best by Keane (2 Disc Deluxe Edition) is a double disc set featuring 20 songs on the first disc and 18 songs on the second disc. “Somewhere Only We Know”, “Is It Any Wonder”, “Higher Than The Sun”,“Everybody’s Changing”, and “BedShaped” are among the hits on this collection. The Best (2 Disc Deluxe Edition) by Keane is best for those while like alternative rock and/or indie rock.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm so pleased to be able to buy my favorite shows through the Internet, rather than having to pay $100 cable  bill every month just to watch them... I really found that this is the way to go: have an antenna, an Internet connection, a DVR and stream your video through Amazon. Pays for itself!<br />As to the American horror story series, it's one of the best written out there today. . Period!
B009NG1Q96|1.0|I easily read The Selection in one sitting and couldn't put it down.  However, when I was finished I truly evaluated what I had just read, it wasn't very special.  Nonetheless, I decided to read The Elite.  This, I certainly put down.  There were times when America's indecision and meekness made me furious.  She is not a good role model for young girls.  When she isn't completely wrapped up in her pointless romantic drama she makes impulsive and damaging decisions.<br />The two love interests also irked me.  They were nearly as indecisive as America and constantly leading her to ill choices.<br /><br />This dystopian novel needs more development.  Although it is well written, as a reader, I often felt like I wasn't informed of the true world the characters lived in.<br />While I did eventually finish The Elite, I will not read the next book.  There are better leading ladies out there.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Very enjoyable book.  I took the 4-book bundle on my kindle on an overseas trip and had something good to read the entire time.
B00EZFN3KK|5.0|I remember first hearing “Here With Me” by Dido in during the period of Autumn 2000.  Fast forward to 2002 when I met my husband and I noticed that he also listened to Dido.  Naturally, I have good memories of her music and decided to give her Greatest Hits collection a listen.  She includes many of the popular and unique songs  on this collection such as Thank You, White Flag, Here With Me,  Hunter, and Stan (feat. Eminem).  I also liked Sand In My Shoes.  It is a good song, but I would have to say that Stan is among the most tragic due to the track being about a music fan taking their admiration to dangerous extremes. Aside from this, Dido’s Greatest Hits is great for those who like music with blends of pop and indie rock music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting. But fun to see if you can beat your friends.  Just enough of a diversion to relax and play, then get back to the real world.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book. I am glad to see Grisham getting back to his more prosaic work. Wish I'd read Time to Kill more recently.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Damages is a keep you on the edge of your seat series! Glenn Close is an amazing actress and does a great job portraying her character!
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|“Frozen” is a colorful animated film involving two sisters named Anna and Elsa gifted with unique snow magic.  Elsa is aware of the talents that exist in both her and Elsa. However, Elsa has certain reasons for keeping them secret.  Meanwhile, they are both part of a prestigious and royal lineage.  This sets the stage for other people of noble birth who want to come and visit the sisters. Anna more than welcomes the visit, but Elsa is naturally nervous about ways to deal with this.  I also liked one of the hidden positive messages to the film where it is implied that it is possible that a person can often have more power within them than they realize.  “Frozen” is a lively holiday movie that is safe for all ages.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|How can you not believe that this movie is the ultimate holiday movie of all time?  You can't, and if you believe otherwise, you need reexamine your life choices.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|Hi I'm not responsible for the death of this game If is boring I want the updates I just don't want it
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Ditto to all those who say &#34;I don't understand this album&#34; and ditto to all those who say &#34;I can't get enough of this album&#34;. It's both. My first reaction to Yeezus was &#34;Wow, Kanye just decided to make an album that is un-listenable for the masses&#34;. It just doesn't really have a good radio single. Half the songs switch mid-song to a different beat or tune. Some songs have no hook. The industrial-sound is overwhelming. But for those who love music, this album is INCREDIBLE. Other than Watsky's Cardboard Castles, my fav of the year. Kanye just does his thing--you may hate his egotistical nature, but if it makes him think he can make this kind of music in everyone else's face, more power to him. Plus, I don't understand people who criticize him for his narcissism. Have you been listening to rap music for the last 20 years? You shouldn't be surprised. I don't see Ye as a role model for how to live or guide my choices by his lyrics--but no one can touch him right now (certainly not in hip-hop) in terms of musical creativity and chutzpah. Other than his rather bad compilation for GOOD music, everything he touches turns to gold. You are watching a master who has grown from Late Registration to MBDTF to this. Everytime you think he can't do better, he does. Don't miss this album!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Extremely disappointing. Google needs to give this product support before it is obsolete due to almost zero apps and almost zero compatibility with google products.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Great story line. Acting is excellent. Love the chemistry between Sherlock, Watson and Mrs. Hudson. Great contemporization of a classic story. No commercials for 90 minutes! Not as long as a typical movie, but longer and more satisfying than network TV.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|(Spoiler alert) As an educator and sponsor of a YA book club I really enjoyed the first two books in the series. Not only was this one disappointing, it was depressing and it seemed rushed. My students were so excited for this title to come out and l haven't talked to one who like the ending. Now maybe there is a new trend in the Joss Whedon or George Martin school of writing that encourages the killing off of main characters, but it did not seem authentic for this book. It actually felt very anti-feminist to have this strong heroine survive so much to be killed in the end, reminding me of the many other plots where the female can't handle or has to \\"give up\\" her power for the sake of the community. I have a prediction that this series ending will doom the planned movie franchise.
B00005MP58|5.0|I think this is a great movie for a great price. I love this long version of this movie. ITs one of my favorite movies.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A fantastic read.  Not just the story and characters, but the was the writing is constructed and the tale told.  And the latter points to the narrator.  Ingeniously original.

B00847VY92|4.0|As is often the case, this sequel was not quite as charming as the first book.  However, it did have one advantage over the original: no one has made it into a movie, so I didn’t know the story beforehand. Miss Porter chose to gloss over a number of years of Pollyanna's life, which is too bad, and the conclusion was pretty obvious.  However, this novel is not about plot, it's about the characters.  Overall, it’s a very satisfying, extremely old-fashioned read.  I liked it -- and you can't beat the price of this Kindle edition.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. The writing is wonderful and the plot is riveting.  Can't wait to read her other work.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|And I enjoyed everyword in it..... fiction wrapped around the non-fiction.  It was the type of book I could and did read and carry around in my head for a week.  I was 10 years old on 11/22/63, old enough to remember and too young to grasped the additional events prior the watershed moment.  Jake/George was a genuine, honest and warmhearted man that I was happy to travel back in time with.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Fantastic story rich with life messages and emotion.  Meaningful on so many different levels yet entertaining, too.  It was interesting to compare the film with the Broadway musical.  Although the emphasis differs between the two media, both are wonderful in their own right.

B00199B2Z8|1.0|After reading reviews that Bryson has similar humor to David Sedaris I thought I would give this book a try. It was not at all like Sedaris's dry, witty humor. instead It was like reading page after page of corny dad humor. Not funny at all. I had to stop after 50 or so pages, which I never do.  Skip this book unless that type of humor is your thing.
0811879542|3.0|I thought the description was a too aggressive and even though the book was entertaining it was not up to my expectations.

B008JFUO4U|2.0|OBLIVION, starring Tom Cruise, is a science fiction movie, taking place on the planet Earth in the year 2077.  Tom Cruise plays a low-level employee. His job is to scout the surface of the planet Earth, and detect residual alien invaders who hide out in various parts of the landscape on the planet earth, and kill them.  The alien invaders are called, \\"Scavengers.\\"  These Scavengers had destroyed the moon.  This effect was copied from TIME MACHINE, starring Guy Pierce.  Any person, having seen TIME MACHINE, will be startled by the shameless copying of the image of the broken-up moon, in the sky.  If you did a side-by-side comparison of the images of the broken-up moon, it would be apparent to you that this aspect of the  movie, OBLIVION, was copied from TIME MACHINE.  Also, the Scavengers had caused earthquakes and tsunamis, as part of their invasion of earth.  Tom Cruise, and co-workers, do their job from tetrahedral space stations that hover 3,000 feet above the ground.  These hovering tetrahedrons are inspiring to look at, and resemble the floating world in GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, starring Ted Danson.  The other characters working on the tetrahedral station (Tower 49) are Victoria \\"Vika\\" Olsen, who also is a love interest, and  a supervisor, named, \\"Sally.\\"  \\"Sally,\\" is seen only on a television screen.  Sally has an anonymous persona.  She utters ominous platitudes, such as, \\"Are you working together as an effective team?\\"  Sally's character is like that of BIG BROTHER in the story, 1984.  Sally's image on the television screen is distorted by static.  This effect was copied from the original STAR WARS movies, where the hologram of Princes Leah was intentionally distorted by electronic static.  In this way, OBLIVION is derivative of STAR WARS.<br /><br />When Tom Cruise encounters the Scavengers during the course of his routine hunting expeditions to kill the Scavengers, what is disclosed is that the Scavengers have voice-altering devices that cause their voices to have a non-human timbre.  This effect was also copied from STAR WARS.  During Tom Cruise's many trips to the surface of Earth, he frequently encountered half-buried, or substantially buried, artifacts from New York City.  These include buried versions of STATUE OF LIBERTY, EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  This was copied from the film, PLANET OF THE APES, written by Rod Serling.  In PLANET OF THE APES, we see a partially buried version of STATUE OF LIBERTY.<br /><br />The first 60 minutes of OBLIVION is extremely tedious.  Tom Cruise makes repeated trips to the bleak surface of Earth, hunting for Scavengers.  On occasion, he finds them.  Sometimes, they are elusive.  Tom Cruise repeatedly flies through canyons, an effect copied from the early STAR WARS movies.  Please recall the fight scenes where space vehicles speed through a canyon on the DEATH STAR.  This kind of scene is repeatedly shown on OBLIVION.  Apparently, the director, screenwriter, and producer of OBLIVION thought that Americans are too stupid to recognize all of the features from PLANET OF THE APES, TIME MACHINE (with Guy Pierce), and STAR WARS, that had been re-cycled to make OBLIVION.  Because of this, and because of the extreme tedium that is produced during the first hour of this film, I give the rating of two stars.  Eventually, it becomes apparent that OBLIVION does, in fact, contain some very clever features in its storyline, e.g., erasing memories and making replacement clones of various characters.  But these clever features cannot overcome the disappointment caused by the tedium of the first 60 minutes, and the disappointment caused by the extremely derivative nature of OBLIVION, that is, its being derivative from other sci-fi movies.<br /><br />I am sorry, Mr. Cruise, I truly loved your performance in WAR OF THE WORLDS.  And I loved your rapport with Dakota Fanning in that particular film.  The storyline, the character development, and the special effects, of WAR OF THE WORLDS makes that particular film one of my all-time-favorites.  However, I am sorry to report that, relatively speaking, OBVLIVION is a dud.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Well.. it's there. It was $35 (but I got 3 free months of Netflix, so it was pretty cheap) but I hardly ever use it. I am a gadget guy, and had to have this of course.. but I don't really see myself using it much. Maybe one day, but now it sits in the back of the tv.. and that's about it.
B0049VZ222|5.0|From the first episode on they keep you interested.  Things will happen that you do not see coming. Just a great show
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Makes you wonder just how safe you really are. Great stunt work, makes you feel like your right there. Good show.
0385537131|5.0|Another well written novel from Mr. Grisham. Couldn't put it down and hated to have it end. It would make a great movie!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|incredible new McCartney cd.  Definitely one of his best.  I've listened to it about 20 times so far and love it.  Not one bad song
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The first time i read this book, I wasn't impressed. I even stopped reading it about halfway into the book. Remembering thinking about how everyone said this book was life changing, I was a bit disappointed. Now here I am one year later, willing to give it another try.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />The second time I read it, I tried not to thinm about the expectations that Ive had for the book. But instead think about Charlieas a character, and a real person my age. I think it was great for me to visualize Charlie not as a made up perfectly fictionalized kid, but as someone who would go to my school. The author did  beautiful job portraying the life of a young, (fairly innocent) teenager figuring out what he thinks about life. Along the way, Charlie meets two seniors whose names are Patrick and Sam. They take Charlie under their wing so to speak. Letting Charlie hang out with their friends and evidently exposing him to th life he doesn't know about. In many parts of the book Charlie writes about his first experiences with drugs, sexual things, and &#34;participating&#34; in life. As the story goes on, Charlie gets more involved with drugs, while still maintaining that quality of innocence.<br /><br />As I read Charlie's entries, I really thought I knew him. Maybe I do. The more I dove into the book, the more I wondered if this was sort of like another person's life.Charlie seems so real. Its very easy to relate to him, even if you don't at first.<br /><br />Overall, great book. very real and relatable characters. I hope youwill give the book a chance like I did.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Another excellent Fire Maple Puzzle/Adventure game with a neat story.  Graphics are top notch and the Puzzles are very engaging with some that are hard to figure out.  Thankfully, they have a Pop-up Magnifying Glass that can give you HINTS when you select it.  If you want, it will also give you the SOLUTION if you are stuck.  The Adventure is very well played out and keeps you wanting more.  The Inventory and Notebook items are easy to access and help you to complete each task or puzzle.  Lots of Secretes to open doors make it more Fun.  Nice Map helps to keep track of where you are and where you need to go.  The Music is soothing and Sound effects are very cool.  That can be adjusted individually if you like.<br /><br />This is a very Enjoyable Adventure that works Flawlessly and looks awesome on my Tablet.  The Puzzles are unique and excellent.  The entire app is User Friendly with No Glitches, Ads, or Annoyances of any kind.  Even has No Permissions at all so it is SAFE also.  If you enjoy Mysteries and Puzzles, you should Love this one.  It's one of the best available in my opinion.  A rare TRULY 5 STAR APP for puzzle enthusiasts.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|For what it is it works great on my phone. I'm able to edit both MS Word and Excel documents on my Galaxy III.
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|Best movie ever! It might be the 6th but they are all great and I was so happy they are bringing back characters!
B000XR49VQ|5.0|Rich and strange.  Possibly the greatest baroque style Shakespeare production ever produced.  Gielgud great as usual.  Michael Nyman and Peter Greenaway's greatest and most complimentary collaboration.  A classic to see again and again.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife's ongoing characters and episode story lines are dependably interesting. The guest stars are unusual and fun but not bizarre. The writers give a nod to political correctness but do not worship at the altar. And while it's clear the writers are liberal democrats, they are not outrageously so.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|finally has come out and it's better than I ever imagined. this app is the funest game to play on.
B008469DGY|5.0|It is 99&cent; but this game is one of the best golf apps out there. If you like golf, you will love this.
B005NNVGNY|5.0|The seminal debut album from Pink Floyd does not disappoint.  As a long-time fan of PF, I've generally gravitated toward later works like Dark Side of the Moon, Mettle, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, The Division Bell, etc.  Going back to the start has added a glorious new dimension to my appreciation of PF from Barrett, Waters, Mason, and Wright through Gilmour's addition and post-Floyd works from GIlmour.  I highly recommend this remastered version of Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.
B003B96AOW|5.0|My nephew loves this action figure!  He has a lot of joints for range of motion, and compared to other action figures that I have bought him (all have been from the &#34;Diamond Select&#34; set which are FAR better than any other collection that I have seen in regards to detail & durability) because he comes with a bunch of guns & kitanas, etc.

B00B5HQLMI|1.0|This guy is a clodhopper compared to Moore, Connery, Lazenby, and the others who portrayed Bond. Woody Allen would have been better than this creep. No sophistication whatsoever. Goofy smile and a wooden personality does not  resemble James Bond.

B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games ever! When start out  you have nothing but a stone pickaxe, stone sword, and stone axe.

Really recommend it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns, but don't like endings that leave you hanging. Please write a sequel. for Gone Girl,

B0064X7FVE|2.0|I experienced it as slow and not any where near as updated and informative as weather bug. I deleted it.
0091939526|4.0|Overall I thought this was an interesting book. Of particular interest to me were the sections dedicated to mass gain and the Slo Carb eating plan. As a textbook &#34;hard gainer&#34; I have been at the exact same weight for the last 16 years despite having tried 5000 calorie a day diets, served in the infantry for 3 years, rowed for two years in college and tried just about every Men's Health food/exercise plan possible to increase muscle mass. I'd pretty much given up on the idea of being able to tip the scale over 160 (I'm 6' tall), but I read the chapters on gaining muscle mass and thought it sounded like a fun experiment. After setting my baselines in the gym and performing a Dexa Scan ($70 and about 30 minutes of time), I settled into a four week plan from the book. After 4 weeks and 8 x 20 minute workout sessions, here's the results;<br /><br />Before / After:<br />Body Fat: 20% / 18%<br />Weight: 158 lb / 172 lb<br />Strength Gain: +40 lbs per exercise (Front Pull-down, Shoulder Press, Incline Press, Leg Press, Yates Row)<br /><br />So the science that Tim cites may not all be 100% correct (what nutrition/exercise science is?), but looking purely at the results he seems to be onto something. Are you going to find a secret that will give you a super-model's body without any sacrifice to your eating habits or lifestyle? No. But there are some worthwhile tips on results oriented eating and exercise that seems to produce.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game takes me away  when I'm stressed out with life . I enjoy it to the highest amount of fun that is legal lol. But it's fun and challenging .

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book. Eventually I could not put it down. Had to see how it  ended. There were good character developments and story lines.
0765338211|4.0|Enjoy a good sf novel. Kept me interested all the way through. Not a fan of writing a book and then following up with books which set up the current novel later on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  So addictive.  Have to limit myself when playing (thank goodness you only get 5 lives).  Would recommend this game if you want to use strategy in playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can you in the next update add redstone<br />Because I love mining and I find redstone all the time also can you add some thing new

B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I've read five Harry Hole novels now and love them all.  I gave this four instead of five stars because it was my least favorite.  I liked the other novels better because Nesbo developed the characters in a richer way.

B00144VBBS|1.0|No because Ups launched it at my door and cracked my case and now the disk itself skips and can use it wow what a waste of 22 dollars for a CD
B006CHML4I|1.0|Does not work.  Stops.  Watch is good looking  but can't  keep time. Would not recommend this at all for purchase
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Game structured so you can only advance so far without buying game boosts. I like challenges but don't want to have to continually buy boosts in order to play.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I love this book and I have read it twice. It gave me a greater understanding of President Lincoln and reinforced what a treasure he was, and still is to our nation. Doris Kearns Goodwin is an amazing historian, if you love American history this will surely be one of the best books you have ever read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book, but I'm somewhat biased since Jennifer Lawrence who plays Katnis in the movie is my beloved niece<br />:-)
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting, but not well-supported with research.  Diet worked for me, but still not sure if it's because of the absence of wheat products.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|This is an excellent film. It reminds me of goonies but with an alien. We have watched this a few times and will continue to do so.

B003U4UNPK|5.0|Season three has its ups and downs. There are a few 'filler' episodes and characters (Nikki and Paulo, for example), but there's a lot of really good episodes, too. And whatever shortcomings the season might have are made up for by the great (if bittersweet) finale.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|GOOD MOVIE! We saw the movie in theater and got this for my son as a birthday gift. They fought over the little critter, but it was a great gift.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is super disgusting with all the smashing of the heads...lol... but I'm hooked and now I'm upset that I'm all caught up and have to wait weekly for the new shows. Sigh!

B009NF54ZE|4.0|Game is segmented into chapters to work one at a time three puzzles each.  Game is about mid level skill.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used it for three years. Changed phones several times during that time and SwiftKey has always been a must-have app
1465414444|5.0|This hardbound book is well written on high quality glossy stock paper with good font.  From the cover itself to the pages inside this book contains just fantastic artwork. The text in the book covers the history of the World of Warcraft that includes not just the MMORPG everyone is familiar with but also covers information on some of the earlier games. The history is not detailed but is written in such a way to give you a broad understanding of the complex universe that contains the world of Azaeroth. A full history would take a huge tome yet this touches on much lore and even gives you a brief glimpse of the convention but no real “behind the scene” information. It is a fast and enjoyable read. Other than that this is a book that belongs in the library of any fan of the World of Warcraft.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is amazing. The possibilities are endless. Even just the free version is really useful for keeping all sorts of information. The paid version is really where Evernote can shine-more features and integrations make this my favorite app, hands down.  I'm always trying to get people to use this app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. This is the best animal game ever.this is not a scam game were you have to pay for things well , only if you want to .best game ever

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Baldacci does not disappoint his readers.  King and Maxwell are complex characters, and provide the reader with an especially thrilling story line that rings true in the context of the world we live in.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Why this I a such a great game? Is because you get to have FUN with animals but, the scary part is when the zombie wolf charges at you and it eats you. I would get this game and the best part is that it is FREE! This is a heak of a great game so good luck downloading it because it took along time for me to down load it I mean my dad down loaded it. Anyway have fun and there is more other games like this because I have them like deer Hunter upload s. ;)<br />:) :-) hehe I love faces on devises! &lt;:)
B000AP04OM|5.0|Really, who can top Rogers and Hammerstein for music and that's just for openers? This should be required viewing to see what a real love story is all about. Robert Wise was a good pick to direct this musical. Decades ago the young Orson Welles was in need of an editor for Citizen Kane (1941), and Robert Wise helped put that movie on the map. Wise was asked to direct The Sound of Music (1965) after it had been abandoned by William Wyler on the condition that 20th Century Fox agree to finance The Sand Pebbles (1966). Wise, who also produced the musical, won his second Best Director Oscar and the Best Picture Oscar. William Wyler would have been my first choice for the Sound of Music, but not after I saw what Robert Wise did. We knew Robert Wise could do a great job with musicals after West Side Story. Julie Andrews was a great pick for Maria. By the way, what happened to that beautiful nose of hers? Why did she tamper with it? Anyhow get this disk.<br /><br />This blue-ray edition is fantastic in every way. A must see. Give your old DVD to someone else and get the blue-ray now.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Good plot with the usual twists and turns. BUT too short! Hard to imagine Rebus accepting a situation like this

B00G21YLF6|5.0|I give a 5 for the show but a 0 for the price hike from morning to afternoon.  DOubling the price was really wrong.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I, for one, really liked this book! I am not going to spoil anything for people, but I felt that Roth gave a good ending to the series. I respect what she did in the end and understand it... even if I did not want to believe it at first! The end of Insurgent was such a cliffhanger and I really enjoyed finding out more about this world in Allegiant. The switch off between Tris and Tobias was interesting and added to the story, instead of leaving everything one sided from only Tris' point of view. If you liked the first two books, don't quit before reading Allegiant! Read it for yourself and form your own opinion. I am still a fan of this series and am looking forward to seeing the movie(s)!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing device. Simple to use and, NO MORE CABLES. Clutter free has taken the next step in cable free technology.

B003F3FJQO|4.0|Much better than The Maze Runner, more action and story.  Guess I'll be reading the 3rd book now...  If you liked the Divergent series, Dilerium, Ugliest, Hunger Games, you'll like these books too.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I originally enjoyed this series when I was younger.  It now seems a bit hokey (especially when compared to all the spin-offs).  However, due to a Lightening Deal, I just couldn't not pick this up.  Watching from start to end will be an interesting experience.  The main thing I remember is that the folks wearing red shirts ALWAYS die in the episode.  I am sure I will remember more this go around.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love it! It allows me to watch what I want, when I want for about 10% of one month's cable bill.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Preston and Child have done it again. From beginning to end they kept me captive, not wanting to put the book down. And their Sherlock Holmes story would have made Doyle proud. Now I've got a long wait until the next Pendergast saga. Can't wait!

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The Circle is the ultimate realization of all social networks becoming one.  Author Eggers has done an interesting job juxtaposing youth oriented optimistic objectives about the benefits of social networks (and even more so, working in a company providing those services) with the underlying social isolation those same services may generate.<br /><br />The questions posed in a different, more engaging, and significantly more technology driven book Ramez's [[ASIN:B00EU7KXH4 Crux (Nexus)]] of \\"who should hold greater powers over humanity\\" moves the story in two basic directions; those who embrace the new tech and those that want nothing to do with it.  Mr. Eggers wisely leaves the reader to ponder those same questions.<br /><br />The hand of \\"The Circle\\" provides for some catchy working phrases that prove that transparency and openness are the only way for humanity to evolve past violence and unproductive motivations. The \\"founders\\" are all about making the world a better place and provide sufficient arguments and ideas that The Circle provides those things for all equally.  With those same ideas, brainwashed employees leading to brainwashed Americans is current food for thought.  Who would not want crime removed from their neighborhood with cameras planted on every street, every beach, and every home for the sake of their own safety?<br /><br />For this older reader, but with a social network presence (just in writing a review online!), the dystopian viewpoint came through load and clear.  No one should have this power, for even if you trust those in charge to do what they say they are doing (and no abuse is occurring), who will be in charge after those people are no longer around?<br /><br />Without providing too much storyline detail, the story focuses on the viewpoint of Mae, as a new and enthusiastic Circle employee.  Mae evolves over the course of the story and that same transition is a central tenant providing readers much to think about.<br /><br />The Circle provides many pauses for thought, even potential cringing at the concepts provided.  That same discomfort was contrasted with wondering if a different audience (loosely, and without any disrespect intended, \\"the current generation\\") would embrace the same concepts.  This compare and contrast may be the most rewarding part of reading The Circle.  The Circle is recommended for those that like their dystopian concepts crouched in the optimistic good of humanity.rovides many pauses for thought, even potential cringing at the concepts provided.

B0019TYQ38|5.0|If it is possible for one to improve upon Jane Austen, Emma Thompson has done just that. Not only does she star in this movie, but she also wrote the screenplay! She has updated the story for the modern audience, and has given it more humor and charm. Thompson actually added a younger sister to the Dashwood family for some comic relief, and it works wonderfully. The dialogue is perfect, sounding true to the period, yet understandable for the 21st century. The costumes, lighting, music are all beautiful. Directing by Ang Lee is superb. One of my top 10 favorite movies!
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Great movie, very funny and everyone loved it. I hold back a star because the ending was a little bit weak. I would definitely watch it again though.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The graphics were fantastic and beautiful. loved the entire experience from beginning to end! Especially love the addition of animal characters in-game, and the evil Sorceress is a lovely addition as well! This game will blow you away with it's intricate puzzles, detailed animations, and breathtaking scenery!
B000I5SY9Q|3.0|Great movie. Considered by some at the time to be far fetched. Now it seems to be an accurate prediction of the future.  Great Oscar winning performance by Peter Finch (posthumously awarded). One of the last significant roles of screen legend William Holden. Beatrice Strait received an undeserved best supporting actress oscar for 5 minutes of sobbing then went back into obscurity.  Only criticism of the movie  is that the obvious symbolism tended to be underscored by redundant preachiness. Perhaps this was necessary at the time it was made as the message was revolutionary. I would recommend it to fans of HBO's News Room or anyone interested in how media shapes our thoughts
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Whole family loved this movie. Out of all the animated films I actually liked this one. It wasn't a rehashed storyline that was totally predictable, the movie was original.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was absolutely amazing. I couldn't put it down. My favorite book, hands down. I definitely recommend this book. Thank you John Green!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|GREAT Game! Really addicting. just need cheaper costumes and easier ways to get gru coins. Overall great job makers.Awesome Game.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show, should of never been canceled. Like Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon pure adventure, with well fleshed out characters and stories. I never even knew the existance of this series when it first came out, it wasn't until I happened to see Serenity that I found it based on a series. Whats really disapointing is there were only 14 episodes made. Browncoats forever, long live Serenity.

B0006IEVFG|1.0|This watch is a solar rechargeable unit with a special battery. It arrived without a full charge, but placing it under a lamp for the number of hours specified by the instruction manual brought it to a full charge. After a time, it started to run down. At this point, putting it under a lamp would only bring it up to 2/3 charge (maximum), and now it needs re-charging more often than once a week just to keep it running.<br /><br />I contacted the Watchtronics, inquiring about an exchange for a replacement watch, and indicating that as an alternative to a new watch, I would accept a new special Casio solar rechargeable battery - IF they could direct me to a Casio authorized service center within a reasonable distance of my home(because the manual indicates that the special battery should be replaced by an authorized service center).<br /><br />The reply I received was nothing more than one sentence and a link: \\"You can contact Casio Warranty Repair here:[link]\\" No reference to the battery came with this information, and the link takes me to what appears to be a page for Casio dealers to use, not consumers. (I believe use of the page requires an existing account.)<br /><br />I contacted Amazon indicating my problem, they recontacted Watchtronics TWICE more,butI have not received any further reply from Watchtronics.<br /><br />As far as returning the watch, I am (unfortunately) out of luck because both the seller policy, and Amazon's \\"A-Z Guarantee\\" would require me to finalize any return within 30 days, and the problem did not become truly apparent within that time - but it is important for me to note that the seller does indeed have it within their power to help me; their Amazon seller profile indicates (at the very bottom) that they themselves are an authorized repair center, and therefore could have offered to switch the special battery for me.<br /><br />If I were Amazon, I would cut ties with this seller. Their lack of appropriate response is an indication that they do not uphold Amazon's excellent commitment to customer service.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|A great album full of hooks and awesome guitar work, screaming vocals and catchy choruses, one of their best albums yet. get it into you!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham has done it again.  A trial thriller that compelled you to turn the page to see what was next.
0425263908|5.0|Great books. Better than the Fifty shades trilogy. Can't wait for the forth book to be released! I would highly recommend these to everyone who has read Fifty Shades of Grey
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The concept of the game is great and so are the graphics.  It's just like temple run and angry gran run but better! I could probably play it all day.  I w would definitely recommend this game.  Hint: If you get bored with one place you can upgrade the location).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Double the fun-iPhone and kindle! Hard to get anything else done. Love this game. Super addictive  with challenging and easy challenges intertwined.
0446554995|5.0|Just love these characters...neverending action. Good to flesh out more of some of the parts of the prior books. Lots of twists and turns.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I am addicted to books written by Michael Connelly.  Great characters.  Current and clever plots.  Never a disappointment!  Won't stop until I've read them all.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Nailed it as usual,  just enough twists to leave you hanging.  Although I wonder why she didn't follow through with more details about the killers trial etc...
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A wonderful fairy tale, well written. I fell in love with the writing and the tone. Just absolutely well done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is fun me and my kids it keeps them quiet and me in peace.<br />You should download this game for your kids it keeps them very quiet.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Close-knit group stays loyal in midst of adversity.  I end up rooting for the bad guy ala Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  The hero outsmarts everyone and finds true love.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|This is a great book.  I've read about the physiological effects of wheat on the other organs of the body, but this was an interesting read about how it specifically effects the brain.  It's easy and quick to read.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|OMG!  This movie was hilarious!  I rarely watch a comedy but my sister (who never does either) said it was really funny and told me I HAD to see it....so I did!  I was under stress for the past  3 days and really needed something to cheer me up...and this crazy movie certainly did the trick.  It was laugh out loud, FOYA funny  and a comedy I'll never forget!  I thought that those who gave it a bad review, like for example criticizing Jennifer Aniston for being a poor choice for the stripper  role, should never have been watching a comedy like this to begin with.  Come on already, lighten up!  This isn't a drama or a movie one would take seriously...there's no message to be conveyed and no moral conflict to portray.  The only thing to take seriously here is that it's seriously funny!!!  Besides, I thought Jennifer did a damned good portrayal!  See it...it's a little comedic gem!
B00ER23UYA|4.0|If I read one more review slighting Diane's work with the purportedly bulletproof &#34;she's no Adele,&#34; I'm going to start flipping over tables and bottling heads. Diane is about songs, not showboating her vocal prowess, of which she has plenty. On Speak a Little Louder, Diane obliterates the sophomore jinx with this deeply melodic and brooding batch of songs that have little in common with Bible Belt, her patchy yet competent 70s singer/songwriter-inspired debut. The mix is still slick, but she's starting to harness her goth roots as well as her love for 80s pop.   A tinge of Siouxsie's influence can be detected in the title track &#34;Speak a Little Louder&#34; as well as bonus track &#34;Staring At You&#34; from the deluxe version. On &#34;Lighthouse,&#34; she gives a rhythmic nod to Kate Bush's &#34;Running Up That Hill.&#34; The real stand out is &#34;All The Love You Got,&#34; on which a crestfallen Diane berates her ex about his new squeeze asking him &#34;does she suffer with a smile?&#34; and &#34;drink the honey of your promises?&#34; It's also the sole track on the album featuring ?uestlove on drums. Other tracks such as &#34;Superstars,&#34; &#34;Tell Me Tomorrow,&#34; &#34;Pretty in Pain,&#34; and &#34;Love and War&#34; are catchy, yet somber, and evoke the more mystical pop approach of Stevie Nicks.   It's a wonderful comeback album that, so far, isn't getting nearly as much attention as it should. The only problem is that it didn't arrive sooner.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|I got this as an impulse buy  due to the Black Friday sale and in this case it was a great impulse.  This is very enjoyable. I especially like that it has some variety from perky pop, indie stomp  to  rocking rock.  It showcases good songwriting skills and great vocals.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  Love the humor- laughed the whole way thru!  I was super hyped when I head The English Beat as well!
B00AFEY354|5.0|I think this movie was very good. Acting was perfect. I have recommended it to my friends and family. Sad but well worth watching
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I had not expected this. Not at all. I've never been a Star Trek girl, but after reading this I was close to becoming one.<br /><br />Lets just say this:<br /><br />I started it --&#62; I wanted to read it for ever --&#62; I wanted to get to the end --&#62; I didn't want it to be The End.
B00FVZJYK6|4.0|My Son loved this movie. He watched it 3 times in a row..It is fun for the whole family. Get IT
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|I was hoping this would be a \\"book\\". Instead its the blog in printed form. I still don't feel like I know much about Allie Brosh, it's too much that is not being told about her. Of course, the stories told are wonderful and almost got me thrown of the buss for laughing too loud. Also, I hoped it would take a couple of days for me to finish, but it took me less then 10 hours.
B00F0N61AU|5.0|I've listened to this album a couple times so far, and I've concluded that 'Midnight Memories' is my favorite of One Direction's three albums! It's a more mature effort by the five young men. As you get more into the songs, you can hear a musical and lyrical difference. This time around, One Direction decided to try for a more rock and 80s sound. It begins with 1D's first single \\"Best Song Ever,\\" which I don't think reflects what 'Midnight Memories' has to offer. It sounds a bit too similar to their previous songs. However, their second single \\"Story of My Life\\" is much more unique and memorable, especially thanks to Harry Styles' and Zayn Malik's powerful, soulful vocals.<br /><br />Some of my other favorites include \\"Diana,\\" \\"You & I,\\" \\"Right Now,\\" and \\"Little White Lies.\\" \\"Diana\\" has been compared to The Police, and I think it's a fair assessment. It's been said that this song deals with the members of One Direction trying to help fans who have or thought about hurting themselves. It's a great message overall. \\"You & I\\" is a beautiful ballad, showcasing Zayn's voice, who hits the higher notes effortlessly. \\"Right Now\\" was co-written by some of the guys with OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder, which makes the song all the more brilliant. It's a bit too short though. And \\"Little White Lies\\" is a rock/pop anthem, reminiscent of Queen and Bon Jovi.<br /><br />'Midnight Memories' is a really impressive third album by One Direction. Admittedly, this may isolate some of their core audience, which includes younger girls, because of the harder sounds in their music. And some of the songs are a bit too short for my taste, but there are plenty of tracks to listen to nonetheless. Still, it's an amazing album, their best of their three in my view. Check it out!
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Great covers form the mob, Mike Portnoy is a frigin genius I truly don't know what will happend to the band with out him
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Tales Of Us,  I don't even know where begin. Really just get a copy for your self, and then after you have listened, give one to all your friends. you'll understand.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|If you like SOA star Charlie Hunnam you'll love this movie. It is sort of formula (plot wise) but the special effects are...well, special. Great monsters, mind melding, etc. Watch it, you'll like it.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Quick comment I got this the day of the Bru-Ray release. There were no defects. However throughout the disc as well as on the Epix vers. different lighting effects, photo tricks,(eg.: Instagram) were used. I think this confused some of the viewers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this so fun! my horse is so funny! I love being in competitions! I hope to get another horse and name her annabeth! I have a boy horse now named Percy!
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This young lady is truly talented. Her voice is wonderful, a real throwback, nobody else making music of this quality. She deserves all the accolades!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My favorite Disney movie. No problems with quality or delivery. The remastering is great. This is old school cartoon, not CGI (except for the famous ballroom scene)  Any complaints on the animation are probably because people are used to CGI and forgot what real cartoons look like.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Love it! Can't wait for the Minion movie to come out! Those little guys are awesome! One of my favorites!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This is a hard review for me to write. I had so many FEELS when I finished this book and I was sitting in bed sobbing when I finished. I usually don't like to discuss what happens in a book when I do my reviews because I don't want to spoil it for others so I try and talk more about how it made me feel and what I loved about the characters. Because this is a five book series, that may be a little harder in this one but I'm going to give it my best shot. There may be a few minor spoilers when it comes to the romance if you haven't read the previous books.<br /><br />This book starts up where Apollyon left off and SO many things have happened that have led them to this point. The world is in chaos and things are looking bleak for our gang, now calling themselves the &#34;Army of Awesome&#34; or AOA for short. Knowing what they are up against, I was definitely nervous for how this was all going to play out. As is pure JLA style, there were some serious &#34;WTF&#34;ery moments in this book that left me either skeptical, shocked, or breathless. There is no way that I could ever predict the twists and turns that the plot took and I loved that I was constantly left on my toes.<br /><br />Alex is still, well, Alex. She is strong, determined, feisty and a bit reckless at times. I think she has really grown since the beginning and her maturity really shined through in this book. She was thinking more strategically and a lot less impulsive. She has finally understood the impact of her actions and she would do anything to protect the ones she cares about. The evolution of Alex as a character is one of my favorite things from the series.<br /><br />“For him I’d do anything. Fight a horde of half-blood daimons? There. Tangle with ticked-off furies? Sign me up. Break a dozen or so rules for one forbidden kiss? Done.”<br /><br />I have loved Aiden from the moment I met him in Half-Blood and even though there were moments when I wanted to junk punch him, he has always been the guy for me. He is strong, smart, loyal and an impeccable warrior. He has ALWAYS loved Alex and every decision he has made, right or wrong, was to protect her and keep her best interests at heart. I really saw the man that Aiden is in Sentinel and I could never doubt his love or faithfulness to Alex. He is so sweet and tender with her and he makes her feel alive and whole when nothing else can after all she has been through.<br /><br />Seth, oh dear sweet, charming, cunning Seth. ALOT has happened with Seth over the course of this series and his motives and actions are always in question. No matter what happens, I can never fully trust him but I do believe he truly cares for Alex and the love he has for her is the one thing I never questioned. I don't want to say too much about Seth so as not to give anything away but I will say that he continually surprises me. I can't wait for his own series to come out! 2015? Really?<br /><br />Along with Seth, Aiden and Alex, we've got Marcus, Solos, Dean, Olivia, Deacon and Luke along for the ride and they are all fabulous side characters. I love the unwavering support and dedication that each of them has and they are really great friends. Deacon is Aiden's little brother and he is 100% the comic relief. He's always there to give a good laugh when it's needed; and there some an intense moments that need a little break with humor. I really liked the development of Alex's relationship with her uncle, Marcus, too. This has spanned the entire series and despite his demeanor (it's just the way he is), you can tell he truly cares for Alex and would do anything to ensure her happiness. I love how fatherly he is with her when it comes to her relationship with Aiden. Lastly, we can't forget Apollo. Gods, I love Apollo. He is always popping in at the most in opportune times (especially the bedroom, wink, wink) and he loves scaring the crap out of everyone. He is a God and like the rest, arrogant and shifty but he cares about Alex and hewants to help her and protect her. He's definitely one of the good ones.<br /><br />There was so much swooning in this book and I loved the moments between Alex and Aiden. They were sweet, tender and passionate. There was never a question for me on who Alex should be with. I never saw this as a love triangle because Alex truly, madly, deeply only loves ONE man. Does she love Seth? Of course, but Aiden holds her heart and he has from the moment he showed up in Half-Blood. Aiden and Alex have been through so much and their relationship has been through the ringer a time or two with obstacles to overcome on so many different levels. I adored every breathtaking moment between them in Sentinel.<br /><br />“Only Aiden could look so sexily sleep-ruffled.”<br /><br />Overall, I could not be happier with this book and the way the series ended. JLA spent 4 books building up to the final moments of Sentinel and it was played out perfectly. I loved the action, the romance, the storyline, and the plot. It help my attention from the beginning to the end and I really, truly wasn't ready to let go. This really impresses me because sometimes when a series goes for too long, it feels stretched out and I can lose interest. This never once happened in the Covenant series.<br /><br />I could not have asked for a more perfect ending. It was bittersweet to see the end because it was so perfect and beautiful but also sad to say goodbye to these characters. I spent the final 10% of this book with tears running down my face and when it was all over I felt this overwhelming sense of satisfaction. Whew, sorry for the long review but I had to gush over this book so I could say my own proper goodbye!<br /><br />Adios Alex, Aiden, Marcus, Luke, Olivia, Solos and Deacon! You will be missed. Seth & Apollo? We'll be seeing you again!wants to help her and protect her. He's definitely one of the good ones.<br /><br />There was so much swooning in this book and I loved the moments between Alex and Aiden. They were sweet, tender and passionate.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works well. Supplies the right amount of voltage and fits like a champ. I have had no issues with it, and it is not a distraction
0446310786|5.0|This is a classic novel that is justified in having won a Pulizter Prize.  Our book club chose it as a selection and had a great discussion.  Even though I have read it several times, I bought it take with me to read on a recent trip and enjoyed it all over again.
B001IQDAO8|5.0|Purchased this for a friend. He was very happy with the product, the price was good. Good quality and price. I would recommend this seller.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app I can make fake logos of nature and stuff like that. Also its great car ride fun
B00979CS50|5.0|Long time no hear an album so full of emotion. Neil Young keep on rocking, keep on feeling, his deep feeling music is the best.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Nothing fancy but a great set for the price.  I like the movies and I got them all for a great price.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|Wish I had not spent the money on this book.  So predictable and boring. Don't waste your time or money.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Starts off great with an interesting character. The writing was very creative but by the end I wish I hadn't read it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this series and can't get enough.  The work that was put into the production seems like a lot given the locations for filming and the sets.  I was sad to see how the first season ended, but this is set in a time of hard living and dying. I've watched season one twice now on my Kindle as well as season two.  I just can't wait for the release of season three.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Very funny if your humor runs to the dark side and you're not easily offended. Picked as a &#34;oh what the heck&#34; choice and was surprised at how good it turned out to be.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't expect the turn of events that came about after reading the first book, but it certainly made for an interesting read and keeps you wanting more.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Crude, but EXCELLENT message for young girls.  As a father, happy to watch this with my daughters and wife, who enjoyed it as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the story line and the characters. The book brings about a great closing of the tale for the kids from district 12.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|Okay, this is surely one of the best tablet racing games that I have ever played. Great graphics, Good music, Awesome sound effects and engine noises, but the only problem, for me on a kindle fire, is that the game chrashes to much. Otherwise an amazing game. Good job.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season two didn't miss a beat following season one.  The production of this series is great and keeps me longing for more. I've watched both season one and two twice now on my Kindle and I am looking forward to season three.  I love the characters and their paths they are all taking.  It is quite a mix of story lines and if you have not red the books like myself it keeps you wanting more to see where it will all end.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Microsoft solitaire had no annoying ads  to deal with.  Pretty doesn't mean s*** if you have to put up with adware. Tapping the screen sometimes puts the card where you don't want it.....I prefer sliding the card where it goes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A friend told me of this book and encouraged me to read it.  I am glad I did as it fits right into the worlds I like to find myself in when reading.  There are certain things that Suzanne Collins puts into the books that I feel only a true hunter would understand so it makes me think that she's either lived the life of an outdoors person or had references close to her that they could explain some of the little items that she added. Some of them made me laugh because I've experienced the same things in my time. A great read and thanks for the adventure.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A real page turner.  A very wealthy eccentric man, dying of cancer, writes a new will leaving most of his huge estate to his housekeeper and excluding his children and grandchildren. He then mails the will to a lawyer he has never met, then hangs himself.<br />What happens next is everyone hiring an attorney.  The blame game starts, and then the twists and turns begin.<br />I was a part of the jury watching all of this play out.<br />I love Grishams writing!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Before the latest upgrade you could dim out to a very low level that was still adequate in a dark room. After the upgrade, even at its lowest light level is a beacon of light on my nightstand that keeps me awake. I need to close the cover on my Kindle which defeats the purpose of having a clock by my bed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love playing the app. You can play different worlds and create new things. It's helpful because it entertains me when I'm bored.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Didn't work for my tablet and couldn't find it after downloading it. And would really like like to play. With family and friends.
0761172726|5.0|Love this Calendar - have been using this for 5 years now and with 5 in our family it is the perfect calendar for everyone.  Easy to read and the kids use it regularly now to record their activities.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I don't like it because it did not work for me and I can't find it to play and I like uno
B0052U59F4|5.0|This was an initial page turner...which prompted me to purchase the sequels.<br />Fifty Shades of Grey...Book of the year 2013!
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This book is typical Nicholas Sparks -- lonely (but deliciously handsome) man meets and rescues endangered (very beautiful) woman.  They fall in love and live happily ever after.  Sparks writes well, but he needs some new plot lines.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game helps me curb my appetite. When I feed others via this game and see how much they can eat I suddenly don't want to over indulge myself. Thanks Team Lava!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I pre-ordered this book and I must say, it's an absolute must read. It leaves the reader with a sense of closure to the story.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I just can't wait to get it!! I love it!!!!!! and the second part it's awesome too.... at least for me.
1572704497|4.0|This is a well done recording. I have read the book years ago, but listening to this CD felt like doing the story from the beginning again....
B008602KQI|5.0|I haven't receive it yet but I've seen this movie like 10 times.... I just love it!!!!! hope to get it soon!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome thing to play I can play all day long unroll I die that is how cool it is<br />A
B006FTCH2E|1.0|utterly disappointing, totally misleading title. If you're looking for some off-world exploration, space travel and Science Fiction of that kind , this is NOT for you. Even $2.99 rental fee is too much.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Lots of time consuming stuff to keep you occupied and you don't have to have a lot of &quot;friends&quot; to upgrade.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best game there is. Guns are pretty sweet there are shot guns and a lot more you can upgrade your weapons it is awesome oh and the controls are easy.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I liked it until the end. SPOILER ALERT: Tris died. This automatically makes it the worst book ever. Why kill her when she's the main character through 2 books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game and TNT but you can't explore hell and I can't get hellstone and I kill the gast I rate 5 stars
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Download this game right now I been waiting for it to come out of the android now it did so get it
B009G41CG2|4.0|This game is AWESOME, but it is really hard. It should give you some hints. But I love this game!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I so wish it had an update that would be awesome but I do have to say this is really great game but I do like survival craft a little more : )
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it. it is so addictive and I can't stop playing it! help me get away from this game
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great boxing game that is challenging and fun. Kept me entertained for a while.<br />The fact that you can get through the game without in app purchases is awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is super fun. But when is the update going to be put on the game? Always fun and exciting. AMAZON UPDATE IT!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVE PEETA AND AFTER I READ THIS BOOK I NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM. IN LOVE
1620402777|3.0|This book is amusing enough, but the error in the beginning of chapter 2 is annoying. I don't think you should write about these things if you can't get it right. I should get my money back.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|It's a really well written book. I first heard of Brandon Sanderson when I found out that he was finishing the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. After reading his books in that series and reading his other books, Brandon Sanderson has become one of my favorite authors. The story is really good, and the characters are well developed.
B003ELOQD4|4.0|Transfer not as HD as expected. Good, but not great... I've seen better BluRay concerts, such as Michael Jackson's This is it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great challenging puzzle game! I enjoyed playing, looking forward to more rooms! I spent hours playing today and I'm sure the new boards will be just as challenging.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Its been a while since I watched a scary movie that actually scared me. If you want to be scared out of your mind, you have to watch this movie :0
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love this show. Am a big fan. Those who can not get AMC should consider purchasing this season from Amazon, the price is right!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Excellent!! I absolutely love love love this show. Every season gets better and better. The characters are great and its brilliantly written
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I dont totally understand the story,  but this is one of the most clever and well designed puzzle games I have played.  Definitely a must try! Definitely in my top ten of all time.  The clues are a big help.  There is an eyepiece that lets you see hidden objects...it adds another layer to the game.  There wete sevetal points where I got stuck.  I needed a walkthru website and Youtube for one particularly hard puzzle.  More please!!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Hey, what's not to like! I even love the theme song that opens each episode. The characters are perfectly cast; I enjoy them all. The always evolving stories wrap around the daily adventures and love lives of some very socially clumsy yet very lovable best-friend nerds who work as scientists at the same university. They are grown-up genius super-nerds, but their other closest friends and love interests include some simple, equally lovable (and more in tune with reality) everyday folk, especially a cute waitress who supplies the show with a playful hint of eye-candy along with a very enjoyable personality. Science plays no real part in the show, but as an implied back story for most of the key characters it pops its way into the clever and fun dialogue just enough to gently tickle each viewer's intelligence.  Appreciating science is totally not necessary, but if you do you will find an occasional joke that is even funnier because of its playful tie to actual science. This is simply a very funny and terrific show. Production values are excellent.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Excellent product size. It took me a couple minutes to set up, but it wore good. I'm not sure if the volume transmitted to my headphones is an issue with the transmitter or my headphones tho. The quality of the sound is good tho, just a little bit low volume level from what I would like.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|A lot of the plot took me by surprise. I would think I knew what was come next and was wrong a good bit of the time. I like shows the keep me interested in and keep me rooting for the good guys. Absolutely love the show.
B00G32TD98|4.0|This movie was really scary! My hubby and I talked about seeing it in theaters, but were pretty much too scared to and rented it instead. Good move! We had to take a break part of the way through. The story line maybe isn't super original at this point (family moves to old house, dad goes to work, kids go to school, mom deals with scary stuff in the house alone), but it does a good job making you not expect the scares. If you liked Sinister, Paranormal Activity, and/or Insidious, you probably will like this movie.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|really obvious and bland social commentary on the increasingly high amount of sharing we do over the internet. hitting me over the head with the book would have been more subtle
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I wasn't sure what I was looking for when I downloaded this app, but I knew I wanted my kindle fire to run more smoothly. I was shocked at how much quicker my kindle's response was after cleaning it up with this app!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So far so good. Gets me up at the right time and I don 't see any changes on my Kindle Fire that would make me delete it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it more and more everyday. The cost, which is cheap, versus the hours I've used this already has more than paid for itself
B004G6009U|5.0|I have this movie memorized because my daughter watches it so much. That should illustrate how great of a movie this is. A must have if you are a Disney person.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I gave this game 5 stars because its a great hidden object game and more. It has multiple puzzles of different types which are all incorporated into a pirate. themes story. It will give you hints should you get stuck to keep the game moving. It has 2 modes, one timed and one not. The only negative is the timed version because it assigns penalties for clicking to much like you were randomly searching for items instead of looking. since a Kindle Fire requires touching to move the screen around you get penalties for moving the screen. Using it on an intoned mode doesn't do this. The game has excellent graphics and artwork. I purchased part one for free and part two for 99 cents. I consider both great prices. Together both games lasted about a week playing for a while every day. I think a weeks entertainment for 99 cents is a pretty good value. Some complained that the game wouldn't. pan out and in, some complained that everytime you turned it off you had to start over. I did not experience either of these problems at all. If you don't get through a puzzle and turn it off the program will bring you back to the start of that particular puzzle. The game functioned perfectly on my Kindle.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is  awesome game because you can get coins and can buy a new board like the beach awesome :)
6305428042|5.0|I was soo happy to see such a great price on this movie, its a GREAT CLASSIC!! Definetely should watch it and buy it!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I do agree with some of the reviewers.<br />I loved A thousand splendid sun and Kite Runner.<br />And the mountains Echoed took me awhile to finish up, just couldn't get in to it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I never checked this out when it first came one. I came across this at a VERY reasonable price and decided to buy it. One of the best series EVER!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game, just challenging enough..by  like must game apps I dislike that I have to wait for more lives, or beg my Facebook friends for them or buy them! I'm only writing this right now because I'm waiting  to level up...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a great read. I love that the narrator is Death. It warms the heart at times and sends chills throughout it at the same time.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great game like the achievements. Would recommend to all my friends and family. Love how j can change it up when I get stuck.
B002UQHYK6|4.0|Another excellent read. Just a bit difficult understanding the scientific explanations, a bit more technical than usual. Still a great storyline and enjoy the continuing story around the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Far greater than I ever expected. Collins writes an epic tale that captivates you from the very beginning and doesn't disappoint in the end.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Nice to catch up.  Usually miss a few episodes each year.  Love the characters.  Could do with fewer long story arcs.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It is amazing how all the Kindle Fire users give so many 1 star reviews because they don't understand how the apps work.  I always check Google Play reviews which are a lot more accurate.  People you don't need the font package and they don't charge for updates.  How many one star reviews are on amazon because am app requires a camera and you don't have one, that doesn't make the app bad it means you did not think out what you wanted in your original purchase of a tablet.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game i like it...nice levels....i love the graphics...and it doesnt make it to easy but wish it didnt take a long time to advance
B000007XUQ|5.0|Classic renditions of some of my very favorite classic Christmas carols.<br />Karen Carpenter had the mellowest and most beautiful voice.
B005LAII12|3.0|okay movie was not as good as i had hoped it came in as fast as rain but as i said not that good
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Before now I had not considered reading Dickens nor had the desire to do so.  As a person gets older, and you enjoy reading, you should challenge yourself to read the classics even if you had done so before.  You will have a new application that was not there the first time around.  Please read and enjoy this book with the light in your heart that is Christmas.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|i bought this BLUE RAY DVD yesterday at Safeway Supermarket for $10.99<br />So Amazon and it's buddies are ripping people off BIG TIME !!!!!!!!
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|This game reminds me of the Sierra adventure games from 20+ years ago. It has great visuals and artwork, but the difficulty results in a gave that didn't take me long to complete.<br />Regardless, for what it is, I enjoyed playing it and I the most of you will too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors - his courtroom dramas are the BEST!  I was not disappointed with Sycamore Row - next stop...... &#34;The Racketeer&#34;!!!!  Keep them coming :-)
B0081336FO|5.0|Perhaps the best written (Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss), most intelligent show ever broadcast. The acting by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is otherworldly in its brilliance and intensity. Episode three contains the most fiendishly clever cliffhanger ever conceived. If you haven't watched this series, I suggest you do so before season three begins in January.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|It’s a collection of short stories and in each story every now and then there are moments of sheer genius which might go unrecognized if one reads it too quickly.<br /><br />There were a few stories which I couldn’t understand and I put that down to my ignorance. The author is trying to tell me something but I had difficulty in understanding the underlying meaning.<br /><br />Erotica was tastefully embedded every now and then and the book is written in easy to read English. It’s highly futuristic so if that’s your genre then this book is a must read.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I found Zealot very interesting and well written. It gave a historic background to Jesus' life and conditions of that time.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Couldn't put this book down from page one. Topics are current. Love story, mystery, crime, art, all rolled into one captivating story.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|He covered all  bases, tied up all loose ends.  What more could you have asked for.  I could not put it down.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intelligent, engaging, great cast, excellent plot. The comments require a certain word count to post, and my first sentence says it all.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Excellent!  Very edgy, didn't want to put it down .  I love Scarpetta and as a nurse it is even more exciting. It takes you into the morgue, but it offers feelings of the doctors, how they are able to actually study the evidence of a beloved member of the family, or a close friend and be able to let you nurture the feelings of the doctor toward that person.  It would make one feel Dr. Scarpetta should be the one to perform an autopsy on me or my family.  Not creepy, but a wonderful suspenseful story! Amazon deserves appreciation for the ease of purchasing a book and giving me the opportunity of pre-ordering the books that appeal to you.
B00FY2RTMQ|5.0|LOVE this series and was really happy to be able to get an affordable box set to give as a gift.
B000URWYTS|4.0|It's been awhile since I read this but I thought it was well written and thorough and entertaining as well.
B003ELY7PG|2.0|Given the reviews by some great names, I was expecting a lot more.<br /><br />High: Immensely practical<br /><br />Low: It's just not that revolutionary as I expected it to be. Rather than a 'how to' for the rest of us, it should be pitched as a sharing of 'what worked' for them. Like someone else noted, more of a collection of blog posts... Suspect that would be a better format for this.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Challenging but not impossible, very fun and keeps your interest, hard to put down cant wait for part 2. Love all your games, keep them coming
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's  really good game really addictive and a great . Learning experience  for kids under 3  also teaches responsibility great
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|I love this story line and when it works, it is great. However, I question where some of the videos from Amazon really come from. This particular set is terrible. Maybe I can get through parts of it clearly, and then it pixelates or just stops. I try moving through a section, but I have missed most of several episodes as it becomes unwatchable. I am returning this one, have ordered another one and will wait and see what happens. I wonder whether these are pirated copies - I can't understand why there would be so many problems otherwise.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once started could not put it down. Powerful emotions! Well written. Excellent. Should be made into a movie. 10 stars!!
B00B19H2KU|5.0|Holy crap.  Need to pee...take a friend.  This one will have you looking over your shoulder a little bit.  If you like to be scared, you'll love it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I can't get enough of this game! It's tones of fun and my kids like it to. The only downfall is the &quot;vault&quot; to store things doesn't expand with it character u have to find special items to make it bigger and those items are always the hardest to find. Otherwise A plus!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game that is an awesome time killer. Get it and enjoy as we have. We love this game. Minions!
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|HEROINE/HEROIN... ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR-<br /><br /> &#34; Au Currente &#34;  Excellent,rendition of the NEW Groupie sound...sharp,sometimes painful.truth...Gothic satire. &#34;don't play by the rules&#34;
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book was beautifully written. I felt like an English major trapped in my dorm experiencing wanderlust. It's a mystery, a love story, a comedy, a horror story, but mostly it's a coming of age tale for one boy learning the multiple dimensions of humanity. Learning to see past the paper girl in paper towns.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Can't put it down. Challenging enough so it frustrates you sometimes, but that makes it last longer and all the better when you clear a particularly hard level. Good for kids and adults alike. Everyone should have this game on their device
1416914285|5.0|Great Book. Do not judge by Movie.  Book way better.  Movie left so much out easy read just a teasure. No  Unnecessary graphic sexual dialogue like some books I encourage my kids to read the complete series and Prequel.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Movies like Blackfish are meant to inspire  action; to make to viewer a participant rather than a spectator. The success of such an undertaking should be measured upon how much the viewer needs to be pushedin offer to participate. Unlike movies that do little to help the viewer know where to start (ie The Cove) Blackfish makes it very obvious. And unlike movies that seems to spell it out too much to make one feel juvenile (ie Food Inc), Blackfish's story is sufficient enough to guide the viewer.  Compelling, gripping, terrifying, and tragic,  Blackfish stands out to me as one of the greatest of its genre.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|The Matrix is a fabulous movie.  This movie is about the spiritual world vs. the physical world.  If you are a biblical person it's a must see.  If your not a biblical person you will STILL get the message and entertainment of the movie.  Gotta... go see it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have only used it thus far for Netflix and YouTube videos.  The quality is awesome.  super easy to set up. I was so happy with it I decided to buy 3 more for family members. Can't wait to get them Tuesday. excited for my family to experience them. A+ product.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is a classic movie!  I've watched it so many times... it says strength, determination, and love.  AWESOME... If you need  something to encourage you because you are burned out for a day.  Take a shower and have a glass of wine and chill.  And watch this movie -- it will pull you in and entertain you, as well as leave you feeling good about yourself.  A must see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is the BEST! Mojang is AWESOME! If I were you I would download this right away.You should also download minecraft PC,because it's evan BEATER!
B0019EXZY4|5.0|The Bank Job is a fabulous movie!  It's never a dull moment, suspense and drama worth watching.  A must see!
B003L77G6A|5.0|Very funny, as always!  Love the Big Bang Theory!  Such a great cast that works so well together.  Great season.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|We listen again and again. We also have the movie; we watch it -- I think you get the picture.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and great for the whole family! I would tell everyone to download for a fun time, you'll easily spend time trying to escape! Fun fun fun
B00000K3CR|5.0|After at least 5 times in cinema and 20 times on VHS, I still can't get enough of this movie.<br />This is one of the must-have's and is a perfect example of 1980's heartfelt comedy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Sooooooooo gooooodddd!!!! I love this series and am rereading in preparation for the movies! Can't wait to see mocking jay!
B008JFUUIA|1.0|This is a bad mix of Glee and all cheap college comedies you've seen.<br />Rebel Wilson is the only actress, who saves this boring movie. I have bought the movie just to see her playing in it, and she was worth it. Pity, that she doesn't play the lead.
B00FIUO8MI|4.0|The book is divided between Tris and Four, it is full of new challenges and it is very moving i loved it.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|I cannot but help loving the Red movies.  The actors are great, the action is just right, the script is just right, and the movie is just right.  One can only ask for more from each and everyone in and associated with these movies.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|gamelofts has out done them self's with this one besides my older brother LOVES IT I highly recomemd this app
B0065GC0PG|5.0|Cinder was brilliant, don't let the idea of a fairytale throw you off it is definitely worth the read.<br /><br />I was immersed with every word, the plot twist at the end was for some reason predictable but it still came to me as a shocker.This novel is amazing and extremely intense. at every turn there was something that was just, wow.<br /><br />Cinder was a strong protagonist and lead the book perfectly.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|It doesn't provoke a lot of deep thought so, it was easy to relax and not get confused with never ending plots.  I would watch a follow on movie if it ever comes about.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is fun and u can do a lot of fun things. They also change so they add more stages. Have fun!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Nice game, good graphics . Kinda hard to steer but you will get the hang of it in no time. Must try!
B00821PCJS|5.0|It is very intense and fast pace. It also has a great story line that is somewhat realistic. It is similar to War of the Worlds, but in a TV show. Plus it has a lot of emotion tied to it.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|Worth watching every few years for the superb acting, great story, fabulous staging, and lovely and intriguing script. I recommend without reservation.
0375842209|5.0|Many, if not all, people know the story of Anne Frank. A Jewish girl hiding in Nazi Germany during the time World War 2 and the Holocaust. I always wondered what it was like to be a German during that very same time period, the opposite end of the brutalities and horrors that came out of that era. In The Book Thief, Markus Zusak takes that very side, exploring the live of a young German girl and her childhood as she grows up in a small German town.<br /><br />We are in Nazi Germany on the verge of World War 2. It's a world not much different from the rest of the world, not yet completely tainted by the growth of the Nazi Party. A young girl named Liesel Meminger was dropped off at the home of the Hubermanns after her father left their family and her mother was forced to give up her brother and herself into adoption. Sadly, her brother died on the trip and Liesel enters this life alone. She is very timid and cautious of this new life in Molching, Germany, but in time, she grows and thrives within this new world.<br /><br />Now, the story isn't told from the view of Liesel, or her father, Hans Hubermann, or even any human being at all. Zusak decided to take the story of Liesel, the book thief, and tell it from the point of view of Death, a physical manifestation very much like the Grim Reaper (he even alludes to the scythe and the black-hooded robe at one point). What comes out of this choice widens the story to encompass more than just Liesel's story, even though he focuses on her specificly throughout most of the book.<br /><br />Having Death as the narrator also allowed Zusak to play around with the representation of death in the story: the physical manifestation of Death travels around, gently lifting out and &#34;saving&#34; the souls of the departed. I really like what Zusak did with this idea. I haven't seen an interpretation like this and it allows for more elaboration of each person's lives.<br /><br />From the beginning, you know that story will not end well for little Liesel. But knowing that does not take anything away from the impact. In actuality, it's just part of the slow buildup that climaxes at the very end. It will most likely make you cry, as I did, when you read the ending.<br /><br />As for the character's themselves, they are absolutely wonderful. Each one, especially Liesel and her friend Rudy, grow with each growing page and develop their own special voice.  Both start when they are very young, but by the end, they are maturing young adults as they began to stake out their place in the world.<br /><br />The Book Thief deserves a place among those such as The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank and The Boy in Striped Pajamas. It's a story of growing up as much as a story of the Holocaust. It takes unique stylistic approaches to achieving it's ideas and it will touch your heart both with sadness and with joy.for little Liesel.

B007A4SDCG|4.0|Not just for writers but anyone who is working &#34;creatively&#34; (aren't we all?) and procrastinates.. The R word. A great exposition of what it is that prevents us from completion of that poem, novel, learning an instrument, losing weight, reading the worlds best writers, being authentic and beyond.. I have read straight thru and intend reading a chapter a day, slowly, over the next month..
0439023521|5.0|I was introduced to The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, a few years ago by my friend before it  became a pop hit around the country. With the new release of Catching Fire in movie theaters, I have decided to come back and reread the book. Coming back to the world have Panem for a second time around still held up fairly well to my expectations. It's no wonder that The Hunger Games has become a huge hit .<br /><br />Natural disasters and human war has brought humanity into a precarious life. People live in what is now North America, albeit a different version, in the country of Panem. Within this country lies twelve districts, each one specializing in certain products and where the people live poverty-stricken lives in order to support the jewel of the nation, the Captiol. Years before, there were thirteen districts. After a failed rebellion, the thirteenth was destroyed and the rest were burdened with what is known as The Hunger Games, an event that pits two children, one male and one female, in a fight to the death.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is the story of Katniss, a sixteen-year old girl who supports her family on her own through illegal hunting since her father died in a mine accident. For the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss takes the place of her sister, Prim, as tribute for District Twelve and finds herself in a fight for her life and the life of her fellow tribute, Peter Mellark.<br /><br />Katniss definitely grows and changes throughout her experience in the Hunger Games. At the beginning, she is this young girl, focused on trying to keep those she loves alive. As time goes on, she begins to get a first look into the lives of those outside her district and begins to form her own opinions about society and life. I sometimes found it a bit tedious to listen to her ramble on in her head at some points, but I just passed it by. The rest of the characters have their own personalities, but most just seem to be there to pass along the story to and help set up events for Katniss.<br /><br />It's funny how such a brutal event, where kids are supposed to kill each other for entertainment, gives way to some sort of real/fake love story. The Hunger Games are described as gruesome bloodbaths, with tributes killing and maiming others in horrible ways. Yet, Collins almost downplays this key characteristic in order to focus on the romance that constantly switches between a fake show and true emotions. There were some very violent moments, but for the most part, the romance plays the largest role. I found that the constant switching became a bit annoying, as if Collins wanted to make sure the reader absolutely understood the problem.<br /><br />Within this story of romance and perseverance, Collins takes a stab at the growing split between the very rich and the very poor. She paints the rich, the people who live in the Capitol, as terrible people who find entertainment in watching children and teenagers fight and kill each other in cold blood. They feast upon delicacies and live in posh apartments while those who live in the districts live meager lives, barley scraping by every day. She builds the entire world upon the premise of the gap of wealth and wants to show that it will only get worse if it is allowed to linger around.<br /><br />I really enjoyed The Hunger Games both on my first read and in following ones. For some, it's a story of an individual trying to overcome all odds. For others, it's a romantic drama between two young people. The Hunger Games can take on different meanings, which is one of the reasons why it is such a good book and why it is one of the most popular series today.for Katniss.<br /><br />It's funny how such a brutal event, where kids are supposed to kill each other for entertainment, gives way to some sort of real/fake love story.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|This is a really cool and even more so when one realizes that most of the movie and people exist only on a computer. Everything seems so real.
0152465030|5.0|The best translation of The Little Prince.  This much overlooked book is a true classic and is full of life lessons.  Unfortunately, most people think of it as a children's book.  It is not!  It is a reminder for all of us adults who have forgotten the simple wisdom and innocence of childhood.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|This movie is amazing. It showed a quality that is not really seen in movies. Some of view points are really cool and some are nauseating (fear of heights).
B000JLQSW4|3.0|Still like the original tracks the most. The remastering is decent, but the added material does not add value. Nice for context, but not beyond listening to it once.
B00005JN0T|4.0|It is a really cool movie about the possibility of robots taking over to protect mankind. It reminds me of an episode of the original series of Star Trek.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|this movie was hilarious, jason, jennifer and cast worked really well together. family fun but not for the entire family
B00005JMAH|4.0|It is a really good movie for those who are fans of Harry Potter and his adventures. I highly recommend it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|As I am an &#34;older adult, I expected this story might be too sophomoric for me. Then, of course, the topic of a young man becoming a paraplegic is not exactly an &#34;up read&#34;.  I throughly enjoyed this book. The important characters were well developed, there was chemistry between the young couple and the important issues were presented in an authentic manner. The ending just added to this representing a heartbreaking reality
B00005JNX0|4.0|I think this is a really great movie. It is a fun for the whole family movie. I highly recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As with most Stephen King novels, writing is superb and fast paced and I did enjoy. However, SK may be mellowing and becoming more predictable. After reading Ice and Fire novels, and being throughly shocked with turn of events, I found Doctor Sleep to be much more reserved and it didn't keep me awake pondering just read events.
B0009UC7H0|3.0|It is a very good movie. I enjoyed watching it. I usually like the wide screen edition since it shows so much more.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Great gtaphics. Mini puzzles were mostly very challenging. But had to use hints every now and then. Couldn't put down!!
B00004XMTJ|4.0|I really enjoyed this musical and the dancing. There are a couple of songs and dances that really stand out. The last song is good but a little disappointing.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|enjoy playing this classic game! it is extremely additive. great way to pass the time or spend it with the family
B007REV4YI|5.0|Off the hook greatness. Action and drama that is worthy of the James Bond franchancise. The old astin martin was  flash back to Sean Connery as bond
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have the Google Chromecast in my kids’ playroom.  I like the fact that I can choose and play a Netflix movie from anywhere in the house, that it doesn’t tie my phone to the TV and that I can use almost any mobile device (Tablet, laptop, chromebook, ipod, smartphone, etc…) to choose a movie.  The only downfall is that if I forget to play a movie, the Chromecast home screen creates screen burning.  It already happened on my LED tv.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We would like a hint button. Lots of fun but we need more levels :) we did it with two people.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it :) very addicting and can play when not on line..<br />my husband and I are trying to beat our kids on how high we can get. lol.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Easily his best novel.  John Grisham is more mature in the grand parade of excellence.  Never miss a new title, but somehow I did miss this one or I did read it earlier and appreciated it more on this trip.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't normally go for puzzle games but this is an exception. Fun, but if you're not patient about replaying levels you will spend more than you intended.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|......on a fun story with one of the best story tellers!  It's a quick read that Grisham writes so easily.....or so it seems.  That's talent for you!
B0012GMUPO|5.0|Awesome album from the one and only Alice Cooper, original god of shock rock. CD arrived in excellent condition with art and book.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wonderful story. Far from a disaster. Leaves you wanting more. I couldn't put it down. This is told from Abby's pov. I also recommend Walking Disaster which is told from Travis's pov. Great books.
B00EEDNA4M|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas cause he loves breaking bad but when i got it in the mail the hard plastic wrapping around the barel was cracked. As I said its a Christmas present so I don't want to open it up, but I really hope that the breaking bad barel itself is okay!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this. Yes the storyline is a bit cliche but it's a fun read. I've read it twice now and will read it again.
0316098329|5.0|Fascinating and suspenseful book with hope built I wasn't sure which way the story would go. There's always a reason for hope!!
B003U51D58|4.0|Always filled with suspense and easily addicting!! It has been a crazy ride to get to the final season, but I can promise it has been worth it. I give this season 4/5 stars!
B00E0PT0FC|5.0|This is a great album and a bit of a departure from the last dave holland albums.  There is a definite rock feel on several of the tracks.<br /><br />Kevin Eubanks is an amazing guitarist and I loved the electric piano work.<br /><br />Of course, Dave holland is amazing on the bass too.
0821221841|3.0|Dated! It was interesting to read, but not what I expected. I'm already trying to resell the book online so I can get another photogrpahy related book.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|This game looks interesting but I cannot play it on my Toshiba Thrive. Entering text is almost impossible. After about 5 tries I named my character but could not name my world. Without a name you can't go any further.
B00942Y4IY|2.0|marginal plot and storyline. While the special effects were good the whole movie was rather a waste of time for both me and my grandson.
B000M4RG42|4.0|This was a great history story that need to be told to the younger genration as they don't teach this type of history in our schools..Richard
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|The plot line for season 4 had been pretty lame. I don't think the writers have anything left. I loved the first 3 seasons.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is a fun game and is addicting. like to check what levels other people I know are on. It helps me keep in contact with some of my friends
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|The music is up beat. I really appreciate how they use common experiences and produce valuable entertaining music that anyone can enjoy. They maintain sounds that are appealing at any age throughout the album. The variance is amazing.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I just wanted to give the book five stars but I have to fill out this comment thingy. Best book I've read in a while.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|This item is a piece of crap.  The resolution of the scanned slides is abominable.  Don't waste your time.  You won't be happy with the result.  I'd give it a zero if I could.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Fun to relive the always entertaining early days of science fiction programing. Interesting to look back and see how much has come to pass such as hand held computing and communication devices!
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|So, what’d you think?<br /><br />The overwhelming response to the 50th Anniversary special of Doctor Who, which aired this past Saturday (as the largest global simulcast in television history) is that Whovians were generally pleased.  They enjoyed the 180-degree turn the Whoniverse has taken away from the darkness of the past that we had gotten used to and toward what is potentially a more optimistic and hopeful future.<br /><br />This turn of events (Gallifrey being frozen in time somewhere in space and not, in fact, destroyed by the Doctor in the Time War) now sets the stage for some interesting story arcs, as well as for the plot holes and continuity errors that are just waiting to be discovered by devout Whovians.<br /><br />One thing the 50th did for sure was live up to its hype, particularly when it came to bringing back the beloved Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, and having him interact with the current and Eleventh Doctor, Matt Smith.  Simply put, the two went together like peas and carrots (or fish sticks and custard).<br /><br />Seeing Tennant again made us realize just how much we had missed him (even if they did make him inexplicably dafter here), and seeing Smith in his first new episode since the announcement of his departure in the upcoming Christmas special (set to air on December 25, 2013) made us love him even more and miss him like he’s already gone.<br /><br />John Hurt’s War Doctor teasing the both of them felt very “you kids should get off my lawn!”  Imagine finding out that you actually get less mature as you get older – you’d probably get irked at your selves, too!  We were all prepared to despise this man, and yet he was, in the end, just as lovable as every other Doctor.<br /><br />Thankfully, the writers had Billie Piper portray the Bad Wolf version of her character, as opposed to the Doctor’s former companion/lady love, Rose Tyler.  Rose would have distracted us too much from the main storyline.  Plus, we now can understand how the Ninth Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, found the Bad Wolf he was subconsciously (?) searching for, and that it may not have actually been pure happenstance.<br /><br />Surely many of us were still disappointed, though, that Piper and Tennant did not interact at all whatsoever during the 50th, so we’ll have to settle for how happy they must have been behind the scenes to see each other on set once again.<br /><br />Seeing Tom Baker was a warm and pleasant experience, even for those of us who were too young to have seen his performance as the Fourth Doctor when it originally aired, and the fact that Clara’s presence was kept to a minimum was a relief indeed and further proof that Clara is less of a companion and more of a plot device, something of which the 50th was certainly in no need.<br /><br />How epic was soon-to-be Thirteenth Doctor Peter Capaldi’s cameo?  The fact that they included him in the 50th when he’s not even the Doctor yet (as well as how they never leave Eccleston out, despite any bad blood that may exist between him and the crew) lends credence to the respectability of this show.<br /><br />Though, even knowing that Eccleston would never return, we were all still hoping he’d show up in that regeneration scene, just for a brief second.  At least he was there in CGI spirit and, for that, we can be appreciative.<br /><br />And now for the less impressive elements of the special.  First of all, the poor Zygons - they really served no other purpose than as a nostalgic throwback.  It seemed that the subplot (which, let’s face it, none of us were paying attention to anyway [and since when does Who have a subplot?]) was simply a way through which the writers could channel their nostalgic homages, like River Song’s shoes or Baker’s scarf.<br /><br />The fact that the War Doctor was likeable by the end of the episode is unsettling.  Simply put, for the War Doctor to be likeable, he has then risen to the same level on which we place all the other Doctors which, in turn, makes him the true Ninth Doctor.  At first, this may seem like it craps on Eccleston’s run, but all it really does is mess with the numbers (Nine is now Ten, Ten is now Eleven, and so on – and we all know that Tennant has to stay “Ten” – it’s in his name, after all!).<br /><br />However, thanks to the spoiler that was released today with regard to the upcoming Christmas special, apparently Matt Smith is the Thirteenth and Final Doctor.  What?!  So then they really have been following the numbers rule all along, even if Whovians were the last to know.  But now that Gallifrey has not, in fact, fallen, it’s more than possible that the Time Lords will grant the Doctor more regenerations, something that seemed less likely before – perhaps as a thank-you for saving the planet?<br /><br />Two things the creators of Doctor Who manage to do time and time again is to talk themselves out of corners that they had painted themselves into, and to move us to unmatched levels of emotion.  The 50th anniversary special certainly accomplished that, and much more, culminating with its final shot.<br /><br />Now, we can prepare ourselves to weep on Christmas as we say goodbye to Matt Smith.  But hey, we’re also saying hello to Peter Capaldi – a Doctor who may not be as dark now as we may have been initially led to believe.  Interesting things to come indeed.e other Doctors which, in turn, makes him the true Ninth Doctor.

B00DJ80VLS|3.0|If you're a Dream Theater fan you will like this album. If you're kinda on the edge with prog music you may not find the entire album to suit your tastes. Mancini's drums are different from Portnoy's melodic style. I have not found a sound system that complements the arrangements - ear buds and car speakers don't do it any justice. But as one would expect, great perfomances from LeBrie, Petrucci, and Rudess.
B0084670FU|2.0|I only watched about a quarter of it and because it jumped back and forth between 6 different families it wore me out, as I didn't like what it jumped to.  Maybe for a younger person it would be ok.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Been a Mark Tremonti fan for years - after picking up his solo album &#34;All I was&#34;, discovered his current band Alterbridge. Myles, Scoot, Brian and Mark got it done on this album. Great hard driving well composed songs. If you like this genre - its money well spent.
B00340LM8C|5.0|I watch old movies now because I just can't find suitable other movies to look at.  If you don't like the typical modern day movie of sex, violence, cars racing around, etc, then choose some of these oldies.  They are charming and have interesting stories.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Very dynamic and tasteful compositions. I knew of Billy Sheehan (Bass) and Mike Portnoy (Drums) - but who is this guy Kotzen? Well listen to this and you, like me, will be impressed. Looking forward to more from this trio in the future.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|Classic fairy tale with a bit of grown-up flair.  Bit of a twist on the actors roles as well (De Nero, etc.), Very entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For minion lovers alike, the perfect mindlessly fun game for anyone! The graphics are pretty good and it is great in general for a free app!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I saw someone define being a geek as being willing to unashamedly enthuse about what you love whether others think it is cool or not.  This book is entertaining yes, but more importantly it unashamedly enthuses about all kinds of things the author likes with just enough fiction thrown in to meet genre conventions ...
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Classic Bruce Willis in Die Hard series...Maybe the best in the franchise! Really enjoyed the action packed movie as I have come to expect from Bruce Willis.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|On the PC the editing is much more full featured.  I like the automatic indentation and numbering, but sometimes when you are editing something you have already done and try to add an extra item in between, the numbering and bulleting goes haywire.<br />  I am using it on my Kindle Fire and an ASUS android, and don't see all of the editing and formatting features that they had on the PC version.<br />  It is great for keeping notes synced across multiple devices and for sharing notebooks.  I mean GREAT!<br />  Also, the dictation feature is great, especially for my friend who is a 2-finger typist.<br />  It is also great for taking audio notes.
0545265355|4.0|The movies are great, but the books are better!  So much more character development and details that the movie just doesn't have time to get into.<br /><br />The books are an easy read and enjoyable.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|so i'm a huge fan of kanye west his music is so creative. he has giving me two of not oly his best albums in his career but two of the best albums in music history for any genre which of course is &#34;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&#34; and &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34;, but of course he has given us great projects like &#34;college dropout&#34;, &#34;graduation&#34;, and &#34;late registration (my favorite out of the three)&#34; he really has never given me a terrible project, but after the 2010 release of &#34;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&#34; (his best album to me anyway) he has not been on his best game with the 2011 release of &#34;watch the throne&#34; a collaboration album with jay-z I felt like at many times jay-z was beating kanye, and I've always felt that kanye was better than jay, but of course its still a good album and kanye isn't terrible. then in 2012 he released &#34;cruel summer&#34; which is a compilation of songs by artists in his &#34;g.o.o.d music&#34; record label (big sean, 2 chainz, pusha-t, kid cudi, john legend, ect.) which was also good I felt that all the artist were on their game, except for kanye though I felt that at many times he was not bad but not on kanye standards so with this release of &#34;yeezus&#34; his first solo album release since 2010, can he give me or should I say us with a worthy project of kanye's standards. well lets see.<br /><br />1.on sight 5/5<br /><br />pros: a great start to the album with a nice flow from kanye showing that he's back and ready to prove that he's still on his game. also we get a nice loud distorted beat from daft punk! great track<br /><br />cons: not very lyrical and kanye can be lyrical but its cool.<br /><br />2.black skinhead 5/5<br /><br />pros: another nice rock beat and a great flow from kanye that really pumps you up! great track!<br /><br />cons: once again not very lyrical.<br /><br />3.i am a god 4/5<br /><br />pros: great beat and i'm a Christian so I was skeptical of thetitle name but he does say he's a man of god & that he knows gods above him.<br /><br />cons: not the best flow from kanye and his lyrical content is once again weak.<br /><br />4.new slaves ft. frank ocean 3/5<br /><br />pros: in all honesty i'm not a fan of this track its probably my least favorite but I do like kanye's flow and we finally get some lyrical content from him, and I love the frank ocean segment at the end.<br /><br />cons: i'm just not a fan of the beat and even though I like kanye's flow it just doesn't work with the beat.<br /><br />5.hold my liquor ft. chief keef & Justin Vernon 5/5<br /><br />pros: the beat is great, I love Justin Vernon on this track, chief keef actually gives a good hook, kanye's flow is great, we actually get a little more lyricism from him, and its my favorite track.<br /><br />cons: I really don't have a problem with this track.<br /><br />6.i'm in it ft. travi$ scott 5/5<br /><br />pros: I love this track the production, kanye's flows is on point and I like the hook from scott and when the beat drops... wow!<br /><br />cons: not very lyrical.<br /><br />7.blood on the leaves 5/5<br /><br />pros: I forgot to mention that &#34;hold my liquor&#34; has a very &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; feel to it and so does this song its a very tortured love song and I love &#34;808's&#34; album I love ye's flow, the production, when the horns come in man is it good, and once again like I said with the tortured love song its a little more lyrical than most songs on this album I still like &#34;hold my liquor&#34; more though.<br /><br />cons: nothing.<br /><br />8.guilt trip ft.kid cudi 5/5<br /><br />pros: another &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; feel to it actually this song is not a sequel but leaves a reminiscent feel from the song &#34;welcome to heartbreak ft. kid cudi&#34; off of  &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; I love kanye on this track its not really like a rap song more of a harmonizing vibe track so he really doesn't have a distinctflow but I like it, I love the production, and I love kid cudi's bridge.<br /><br />cons: nothing<br /><br />9.guilt trip ft. king L 5/5<br /><br />pros: man the production on this track gives us one of the biggest bangers on the album with a decent verse from kanye he has a nice flow once again not a lyrical track but its cool he has an ok verse, but.....king L has the best feature on this album his verse was great he had an unapologetic flow that will strike the fear in the hearts of any new up and coming pop rapper... he is not playing around great track.<br /><br />cons: I still want more from kanye's verse.<br /><br />10.bound 2  5/5<br /><br />pros: great closer and where I said tracks like hold my liquor, blood on the leaves, and guilt trip have an  &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; feel this song has a &#34;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&#34; vibe and I mean like the happy vibe cause  &#34;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&#34; had a dark vibe to it, an &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; tortured love story to it, and this i'm on top of the world happy powerful vibe to it.. this song has the on top of the world vibe and its like nothing on the album this album has an industrial loud distorted sound to it, but this song he raps over a the classic sample &#34;bound&#34; by the  Ponderosa twins plus one, and its great a great vibe and a nice flow from kanye with a happy love story type thing and its great I love the song.<br /><br />cons: nothing<br /><br />final verdict: this album is great its in my opinion one of the top 5 releases of this year and it is disappointing that its not as lyrical as his last releases (not saying he's a lyrical beast, but he's had his moments in a lot of his albums) but i'll forgive it , because his flow for the most part of this album was on point even more than his &#34;graduation-watch the throne&#34; releases, and I always say this to my friends when we talk about this.. I would take sub-par lyrics but great flow over Kendrick Lamarlyrics but waka flocka flame flow. so I forgive the lyrics. this album is great he takes another leap in pushing the sound barriers like in &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; but its not his best album... I think its better than &#34;college dropout&#34; (not a bad album but he was getting used to his flow on that album) & &#34;graduation&#34; (another good album but after he got used to his flow he tried experimenting and I feel like wasn't ready to completely tackle that task he needed to grow first) but I think that &#34;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&#34;, &#34;late registration&#34;, and &#34;808's & heartbreaks&#34; were better albums but still this album is great and now i'm ready for kanye to come back to the &#34;graduation&#34; , &#34;dark fantasy&#34; type albums where its not far left in sound but still creative and focused on lyrics & flow. this album once again is great and I recommend it to rap fans for something interesting.. I understand if you don't like it but still try it great album final verdict is:  8.5/10 or 4.5/5!  if you have questions on my opinion or would like to show me why you disagree please contact me in the comment section and I will write back when I have time thank you.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is a informational book.<br />It tells you lots of word meanings.<br />Good. If your child needs to look up words use the Oxford dictionary or the Marriam-Webster.
1476747016|5.0|One of The best things i ever bought! Would totally buy again. Just and amazing book over all and great for all ages
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was most excited to read this book after seeing so many positive reviews and after not being able to put it down for a day and a half I must say I'm so happy I read this book.<br />This was honestly. Hands down. The best book I've read in a long time. It had substance as compared to the other YA books I've read recently, it actually gave me hope that there are still good books in this universe.<br />Green has captured the art form of entraping his readers emotions to the words and characters of his books and its amazing.<br />I absolutely loved loved this book and I could tell I will be reading it again. (Hopefully minus the waterworks next time)

B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I have always known about this game and people said it was awesome, so i finally got it. It was hard at first but im getting the hang of it. Its a pretty cool game! I would recommend it if you like to adventure :P
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A great kids game! I know a little guy who loves this game and plays it all the time. :)
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|No time was taken for plot or character development, it was two hours of watching invincible people smashing each other through buildings. Makes for cool action, but there are too many mindless mega action movies like this these days. If you like watching movies that seem like they were written by children playing with toys in a sandbox, then this movie is for you.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I loved this British series . It was interesting to watch the difference between the upper and lower class and how they interacted.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Great songwriting and vocals!<br />Since 2004 (Evanescence's last album) I have been SEVERELY disappointed with most mainstream/pop/rock/alternative music. It's like the skill and craft of songwriting has died as the human race has replaced all down-time in their lives with distractions like the internet (facebook), iphones, video games etc. I sound like an old man, but I'm 36 like Jason is.<br />Think about how good music was in the 1980s and before and on through the late 1990s.<br />All the good songwriters have disappeared and now we have all this crap music.<br />Fortunately we have a few decent songwriters and singers like Jason Mraz.<br />I like hard rock music especially, but Jason is so good that I L O V E his music. Yes, ALL of it.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Hilarious fun! As my 12 yr old boy said...&#34;yup. Stupid... Stupid funny!!!&#34; Liked that there was nothing that was so &#34;bad&#34; my kid could watch with me!

B0040NOWY8|2.0|finished burning the spindle through the advertised burner yesterday with the 5th coaster, wich is a 25% fail rate, unacceptable considering standard 25gb discs have no more than 5% fail rate and they are less than half of what these &#34;Tdk&#34;s cost. Thank God I did not need more than one
B00BPXAQQO|5.0|First of all, do NOT buy these on Amazon. This is double the price of the same pack found in stores. (One that rhymes with Fall Cart. *wink wink*)<br /><br />Second of all, these are wonderful, wonderful dolls! Lovely hair and facial features, poseable arms and legs, and each princess has a unique look that matches her animated character. Dressing them is fast, easy, and my 2 year-old daughter can do it herself. They are each about 4&#34; tall, and the dresses are hard plastic. You pinch the bottom and the top of the dress opens up so you can slide the princess in. Then she can stand up in it. All dresses are &#34;one size fits all&#34; and can be interchanged among all of the dolls. Such a wonderful concept and lots of fun for the kids! All princesses have a painted on swimsuit under their dresses, and their painted on shoes are &#34;wedge&#34; style so the heel does not interfere with putting the dress on.<br /><br />In short: a fantastic item that I wish had been around when I was a kid! Highly recommend.
0684847817|4.0|Froud's art is, as always, tremendously beautiful. There is a uniqueness to his work which makes it exceptionally poignant and unforgettable. He, along with Tony DiTerlizzi, is one of the only artists I know of that have such talent. The reason I'm only giving this four stars, though, is that I was expecting it to be more of a field guide of the Faery world. It's more a collection of Froud's art than anything else. The writing is rather light, and not very fleshed out. Some images don't have an explanation as to what they are representing, and when they do, it is often only a few lines that doesn't tell the reader much. If you're more interested in the art aspect than the lore of the Faery world, or a huge fan of Froud like myself, then buy this book!
1574216988|3.0|This book is just Ok. Maybe if it was my first Zentangle book I might have been more impressed. Also, I am more interested in the Official tangles. The thin little handout is packed with tangles but I don't find myself dwelling on any one page. I just keep picking it up and leafing through it hoping I will get something out of it. If I had picked it up in a store I would have leafed through it one time and put it back.If you know the Zentangle method, I would recommend Sandy's teeny tiny Alpha Tangle. If you are new, get One Zentangle A Day. My only complaint is no table of contents. Don't buy Yoga For The Brain. You can get plenty if ideas on Pinterest and everywhere on the web.

B0043RSK3K|5.0|Over the past years  I have devoted quite a lot of  effort to the task of clearing aside the vast system of self delusion , lies , and nonsense people construct in order to deal with the totally immoral history they have been part of and helped to create. Gradually,<br />, the real picture has become clearer. The singular accomplishment of The Untold History of the US is that it brings together a huge amount of the story of the empire in one place and in a way that is lucid. Furthermore, Stone and Kuznich accomplish this without either giving vent to great moral anger nor to soft-pedaling what is fundamentally a disgusting story. That creates a much stronger, more persuasive story.<br />  If I had been able to read this years ago it would have saved me a lot of work and clarified my world view much sooner.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really enjoyed this. You are quickly caught up in the problems of each individual. Addictive. Can't wait to see the next season.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive, but can squeeze in a game in a few minutes. Hard to put down. Only game I play.  Can be done without buying anything with persistence.
B005PK56TA|4.0|So far I'm enjoying the episodes and will definitely watch all the episodes. Not one of those series you can watch all at once. Too creepy, but in a delicious way.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My very first app was this app I love it I just love all the animals I also recommend 3d animal farm thing but it's picture is a red bird get the free one I say 4+
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Have been unable to get it to recognize my Linksys router. I may eventually get it but for now a no go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great, great game. There is many many fun activities to do on this game great to have for the kindle fire HD. Play for along and beat your friends from Facebook. Unlock the characters and other things. I give this app 5 stars. *****
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked it!!!!!!!  I heard what all the hype was good and bad.  I figured what the hell I'll try it. I'm so glad I did. Well worth it, this is my kind of genre of books.  I'm glad she has opened the door for other authors to be heard as well.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Played the original on facebook but enjoy this one 100% better graphics a few really good would definitely recommend this to my friends
B00F1J3G9C|5.0|Loaded my emails and calendar flawlessly, even my subfolders and old messages. A great app, highly reccomended! . . .
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game has amazing graphics. It is better than the older version. The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars was because s ok sometimes when I try to open it, it says that the game couldn't load. Other than that, the game is really fun.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is finally on kindle I've been waiting for at least six months and finally I got it I'm so happy
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this game I can't stop playing it!!! BUT, I would enjoy it more without all these ads, they drive me crazy
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Leaves you with enough desire to see the next season.  Its exhilarating.  You will not be disappointed.  Get the whole series.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|this is an awesome zombie series.<br />I definitely recommend this if you like the show. I will get the whole thing.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this film, the story, the acting, the music and the production. 1 2 3 4 5
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My son went wild when he opened this. I really recommend it. The detail is amazing, and it was quite challenging for my Lego-genius 9-year-old.
B00321MGPG|5.0|A fantastic series. Both the kids and my wife and I really enjoy this whole series! We use them on long trips to give the kids something to watch without melting their brains with typical kid show gibberish.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I am a huge Bond fan, but this movie tries very hard to reinvent Bond once again. It only partially succeeds. I've heard critics say it is the &#34;best Bond movie&#34; but it is FAR from it. The story gets more twisted and unbelievable as it moves ahead. Bond meets an omnipotent villain who, like Heath Ledger's Joker from &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; sees all things and plans for every eventuality. The villain, played by Javier Bardem, has the foresight to plan ahead. Bombs explode on schedule, lights to go out, computers get hacked, and secret are exposed, frustrating Her Majesty's Secret Service at every turn.<br />I have nothing against Daniel Craig, whose Bond is perhaps the dryest yet most physical of 007 portrayals, but Bond in this chapter could use a boost of charisma. After sustaining a gunshot wound and falling off a two hundred foot bridge (!?!?!) Bond is lost, self-destructive, and apathetic. He pines away his time on some unkown tropical paradise, drinking himself into a jaded stupor. When he learns that evil is once again afoot in the world, a result of his previous failed mission to protect the indentities of  double agents, he returns as the repenent son to surrogate mother figure &#34;M&#34; (Dame Judy Dench) to renlist in the Service of his country and protect her from an old grudge.<br />This time Bond's leave of absence has left its mark. Bond can't do anything right. He can't win a fist fight with a common thug, can't shoot straight, can't do chin ups, and can't seduce a woman (a former child sex slave, to boot, what the !?!??!$%#?!! were the screenwriters thinking?) without getting her killed. He gets an extremely lame &#34;gadget&#34; from a new and younger &#34;Q&#34;, and slugs it out in incredibly unsuspensful and unimaginative fight sequences. In one scene where Bond fights a poor man's &#34;Odd-Job,&#34; the audience can telescopically predict the demise of his opponent, resulting in one of the most poorly staged fights in Bond history. Onenever feels the suspense created By Sean Connery when his Bond fights Peter Franks in the elevator scene from &#34;Diamonds are Forever&#34; or the excitement of the Japanese wrestler confrontation from &#34;You Only Live Twice.&#34;  Along the way, more people die, with more collatoral damage in this Bond film than any previous.<br />There is an homage to Bond's Aston Martin that feels nothing more than gratuitous, and a contrived storyline that gives the audience (as well as Bond) an emotional victory, but a Pyrrhic one.<br />Skyfall entertains sufficiently, but ultimately strains hard to give Bond an identity rebirth, one that I am getting tired of. The biggest payoff is perhaps the resolution of Skyfall, as it hints that the next Bond entry may be more of a return to the &#34;Goldfinger&#34; formula that the producers once embraced. One can only hope.
B00448SE4S|4.0|This is a great movie - but you need to set your expectations before going into it. It's different in style than most other movies - definitely different than the rest of Michael Cera's comedies. And that's not a bad thing. It's like watching a comic book in some regards, with the over-exaggerated battle scenes, overlayed text when someone punches, etc, etc.<br /><br />But it works. It's not so over the top to be distracting, but it makes the movie silly fun - not silly stupid. There is plenty of laugh out loud moments, but it's more genuinely fun that a non-stop laugh fest. You'll smile more than belly laugh. There are times when the story drags a bit, but those move on quickly.<br /><br />This is a cute, fun, quirky movie that you'll enjoy.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|The acting is good, the special effects are fine.  The premise of the movie is so absurd I couldn't get past it.
0399255370|5.0|It's a great little book that my granddaughter loves. She loves the her grandfather's different voices for each crayon  Really fun.
006202406X|4.0|So many of the negative reviews on here are based on the belief that an author does (or should) write for his or her readers. At the end of the day, many of us reading the books want a story to be shaped to meet OUR desires and expectations. After all, isn't that why JK Rowling decided not to kill off Harry Potter, even though that's really where the story was heading?<br /><br />The problem with this mentality is that it's actually not our series to create or shape. A book or a series belongs to the characters and the author who created these characters. In my opinion, an author has every right to place his or her characters over the readers. So even though I cried at the end of this book, I still love it. In fact, I think it's almost tied with the first one for best in the series. I love that both Tris and Caleb truly come to understand the meaning of family, love, and sacrifice. I love that we spend almost the entire book \\"outside the fence.\\" And I love that there is a temporary rift between two of the main characters (it keeps things from becoming too sweet and over-the-top).<br /><br />It's a more emotionally painful book to read than the first two, but somehow it's also more rewarding. We see how hope, courage, and strength push through against all odds -- even after all that has happened and continues to happen. For all those readers who argue that this series leaves us with no hope, I say that they have completely missed one of the most important morals of the story: hope emerges even when life and reality want to rip it away from us. Hope is something we have to create ourselves, and can't expect to be given to us just because we want it. Hope is learning how to live with pain and sadness and not let them define us or overwhelm us.<br /><br />I do have to say, perhaps my least favorite part of the book was the insertion of Tobias' first-person POV. It changed the dynamics of the whole story, and it also felt like his perspective and personality were too similar to those of Tris at times when approached from this angle. It also made the \\"recap\\" moments, whenever the perspective switched back or forth, somewhat tedious and underwhelming...as if the writing wasn't adequate to avoid such moments. But that's really my only critique of the book, despite the fact that I was every bit as devastated by the ending as other fans.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer series is the best thing going and this does not dissapoint.  I have already pre ordered his next one.  I say this as a retired judge with 30 years on the bench.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|It was really quite a good show. It's one of those shows where the setting is almost a character in addition to all of the human characters.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Beautifully written and mesmerizing story of a young boy and his argument with his conscience. There were many factors in the story that influenced his character. I have recommended this book to many friends.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this for a trip overseas to Australia and it was amazing.  It fit my  17 inch laptop and a whole bunch of other things.  I had no trouble at the airport getting through security with this bag; it was easy to remove my laptop quickly and get through the line.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Back to what John Grisham does best. I liked this book very much. I have followed his work and loved the first few books, then he compromised his standards.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show can't want to watch season 4, amazon is the only online streaming outlet that has season 3 available
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think my horse is the most best game.you get to do all the things you do when you have a horse
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awsome this games is so fun when my brother was playing he lost and got mad and keep on going it was halarious and i love the new update with el machos lair it's just awsome i suggest that you get this game
B00BAXFECK|5.0|One of the best books I've read. I loved it. The author is an excellent writer though somewhat nihilistic (except for the power and hope that art and creativity can provoke) and she is verbose. As a visual artist, I loved her imagery of paintings using words. I highly recommend reading this book.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|If you have a kindle fire and you cant do the plane game, I think I might know how to. If you have a camera on your kindle, you have to blow into that. It's been working for me, but you have to blow hard and sometimes, as long as the plane part is. Overall I love the game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a story of.a girl in Nazi Germany who is part of hiding a Jew in the basement. It is a story of the love of her foster parents and the boy next door under the worst of circumstances. It is told in an unusual way with &#34;death&#34; being the narrator. It is compelling and emotional.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great action, especially the chase on roofs - even though it was used before in Tomorrow Never Dies.  Craig is an angrier Bond - closer to the Connery than the flippant Roger Moore, less humorous than Brosnon, and not as morose as Dalton.
1401937268|4.0|I love the cards they are beautiful, very accurate, I would of gave them  a 5 star but they are too big to shuffle
B00BRUPICM|5.0|A different twist on every page. An all together unusual style of story telling that  makes you want more and more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like the emotion in the characters.  The book has a reality feel to it very raw and open.  The characters do not hold back on facing the true reality of their situation it's deep and very personal.  The book seems  to explore various emotions which I love about it.  It really kept me reading to learn more and explore with the characters their deepest thoughts desires and boundaries.  I would recommend this to someone who likes to explore the darker sides of humanity vs the good sides and how they make up a person.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|My son loves this headset and uses it daily.  No complaints and the price was good.  I'll update if it doesn't last but so far, so good!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intelligent, smart, and very funny. It's hard to put my finger on exactly why this show is so enjoyable. I'm not a fan of courtroom drama shows or the non-episodic style, but they hit it just right with this show. The actors are perfect for the roles they play, the writing is sharp and never boring, and the style is refreshing. If you have been avoiding this because all of your friends like it and you don't believe it can be that good . . . try it. You might be surprised.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|Highly irreverent book treating God like a personal Santa Claus. This is for those seeking a personal handout from God. While he is a loving caring God he also puts rule in place, such as personal responsibility.
B000YADE04|1.0|a total  waste of time. not recommended. thank god for the fast forward feature. it was obvious from the beginning this would be a disaster and it was.
B0000084J7|5.0|It took me a LONG time to warm up to this album, but it's not the fault of the music. I simply wasn't ready for it yet. Mark Hollis is a genius and it's a shame that he is no longer making music. This is simply a magical release. This takes patience to appreciate, but well worth the time.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|All of the Scarpetta novels are worth reading.  The suspense keeps you wanting to read more to get to the conclusion of the book
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is one of the better games. I really love it. You have to use your brain &aacute;nd your vision. You don't have a chance to get bored.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game! Happy it's finally available for Kindle. I carry Kindle with me everywhere and this is an added bonus!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down! Some of it was predictable but the epilogue made it great. I will be reading more of her books.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book is an essential part of any sci-fi collection. The characters feel real and the places and things feel, appropriately, otherworldly.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Simply one of the best books on screenwriting ever done. Informative, easy, good samples and examples, and plenty of &#34;outlines&#34; and formats. Clear explanations and formulae.<br /><br /> I write books, but screen writing is good to know.<br /><br />Buy it!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved it ties up a lot. Great series and soon to be great movies. By far one of my favorite series
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Great 80's nostalgia.  Kicked up a lot of memories with D&D and spending Saturday afternoons in the arcade at the mall, where you would put your quarters on the rim of the machine to reserve your place in &#34;line.&#34;  Ernie Cline is always an entertaining story teller and this one didn't disappoint.  There were some twists here and there but you never doubted the end would be rosy, and for me that detracted from the tension a little bit.  Overall a good read and looking forward to the next one.
1595141979|5.0|Mason, who is gone, keeps reappearing to Rose.  Has she lost it, or is she completely losing.  According to her research about the Shadow Kiss (which her best friend, Lissa, did to her when saving her life a long time ago) it is very possible she is going crazy.<br /><br />She wants and need Demitiri all the more, but refuses to pull him into this tangled up idea of hers.  They have one duty and it is to Lissa, not to each other.<br /><br />When Demitiri finds a way to help her, finds a way to be together it opens up to a whole new world of possiblities.  On the night of uniting themselves, they are faced with fighting Strogi.<br /><br />When her mother and lover lead them into battle, what will happen is she loses one?  And how far gone are they?  Yes, you will have to continue to read to find out the whole story.<br /><br />This story was deeper than teenage drama, it was fulfilling as an action romance novel for me.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Smart writing, clever story line, and good scientific foundation with science.  Reminds me of reading Larry Niven and some of the masters.  My first introduction to Scalzi and will definitely read more.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Good story but predictable most of the time.  The last few chapters were laborious and frankly, I could have done without them.  It as the only section that made me want to abandon the book.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Sci Fi movies usually fall into the trap of relying on their special effects to overcome a stupid plot line.  That's where James Cameron, JJ Abrams, and a couple others earn their money.  Avatar rocked in the theater and the Blu Ray does the same at home.  My son usually pulls this out and we both end up sucked into watching it on a 70&#34; screen with surround sound.  It's absolutely a movie worth having in your home library.
B000063UR2|5.0|I came across the film after I appeared in a painting based on this movie. Although I may be biased I truly love this movie. It really is legendary
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For a story that started out as blog installments, this has become one of my favorite sci-fi novels of all time.  Great post-apocalyptic setting that builds into an epic story with a lot of early seeds planted for twists and turns later.  Download it and read it.  Hope Hugh keeps writing more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Even my wife the anti hunter found some fun in the hunts<br />It's not too graphic although there is some blood spatter on good shots.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG....it is like temple run, but...... so much better!!! if u don't like it just delete it. but I am sure that you will like this app.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was better than the movie it was a beautiful story That someone save her. She help the scarecrow,the wooden man,and the lion. It was so beautiful
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was great having Jake Brigance back.  Thought Grisham had lost his touch. Seems like he is back as well.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|the camera is fine but the video not so much:( it worked once when i first got the app, but now it does... not please fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Animation is so much better new location and minions are  so cute especially in the intro get this game seriously
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is nothing more awesome and useful as God's word. I love this app. The search filter is great, the daily reading plans are cool, and every now and then a little reminder mentioning how even 5 minutes in the Word can do a world of good. Two thumbs up and five stars for YouVersion's Bible app.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|This is a useful app. One bad thing is that it uses a default font different than the one in my .doc file but just converted to pdf and it worked great.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this app, but eventually got tired of my drawings not being sent. Something would go wrong and it would make me draw again. The words were sometimes repetitious, but all in all, I had a fun time drawing and guessing my friend's masterpieces.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Ran down my battery too fast. Was disappointed in how fast it used up my battery as I prefer this channel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Saw my very young nieces and nephews playing this game and it took everything I had not to take their game over, lol. Especially enjoy that the challenge increases in difficulty so you never get bored. Excellent game that can be shared with the entire household regardless of their ages.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Beat it in less than an hour. Wouldn't have paid for it. Got as free app of the day. Simple concept. Map and diary helpful. Just getting into the story and *BAM* its over. Wish it had been longer
B009UX2YAC|5.0|First Happy Thanksgiving &#60;3 Great Game For Kids AND Adults! :) So Yeah..Get It Beautiful ;) Omg..Weirdo..So..Weird. Ok So Have Finn!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This used to be fun unit that has changed to frustrating...can't complete rooms...friends can't help<br />They really want your money!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It keeps me on my toes!!!  I am constantly trying to better myself.  Could I be addicted?  Oh well, at least it's a safe and calorie free addiction!!!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this season. It was full of unexpected and exciting twists. Who knew?? (No spoilers here!)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this game! First tried it on my aunt's kindle but now I'm getting it on my kindle! It's taking awhile to download but i love it!!!!
B00FXES5WS|5.0|If only all singers would stick to the original melodies instead of adding their own unnecessary embellishments! This was just about perfect except for a few overblown instrumentals.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER AND I COULDNT ASK FOR MORE MONEY WELL SPNT FOR A GREAT APP LIKE THIS
B007REV4YI|5.0|By far the best Bond film in decades, even going back to Casino Royale...you can see how dated it feels in terms of cinematography, action and writing.  This Bond film brings a memorable villain that's interesting (unlike Casino Royale) and seems to fit perfectly with the topic of the changing world of espionage in the 21st century.
B003DWU98U|1.0|I could not complete watching this.  Perhaps because of the cultural difference.  It was not interesting in the least to me.  I understand it's a classic it's just not my cup of tea.
0553801473|2.0|Hopefully, this is not the end of the series. I was less than happy with the ending. The characters were left hanging with no real conclusion.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Oh, I love it because I love Denzel.  I commend his portrayel of a character who made my stomach cringe.  The character is so pathetic I could not feel sorry for him.  Bravo, Denzel, I believed it and didn't like you at all.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I am not sure what to make of this app. The instructions are less than helpful and I do not see what I qould use it for anyway. For me, it is a waste of time and money. Hopefully, I will eventually figure out what to do with it.
B008PZZFHA|5.0|Repeatedly watch this movie.  If you like South Park, you'll love it.  If you hate South Park or are offended by course language, stay away.  The songs will stay in your head, but unfortunately you can't sing them in polite company.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is the perfect option when you want to check your mail but do not want to go through the hassel and effort of dragging along a laptop wherever you go.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I can't believe the number of times I've referred to this book in talks I give.  I'm beginning to feel like I should be getting a kickback!  There's no deep secret or zen-like enlightenment hidden within, but it's a fun, almost Dilbert-esque story about what it's like to speak truth to power in an IT-centric business poised for big changes.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|First of all, it only works with 4 apps in NEXUS 7 and Chrome web browser is NOT supported.  You can only steam Netflix, hulu,etc.  Lack of support for mirroing anything is pretty shocking if you ask me for a technology that was just released.<br /><br />I also tried on laptop (it supports web browser in pc) but it kept disconnecting.  When it was working, there is a 2-3second delay and often freeze screen and skip.<br /><br />Next time, I am skipping android altogether and stick with appltv/ipad.<br /><br />As for streaming through Netflix/hulu apps I have not tried.
B007UXT6O6|4.0|This movie is obviously bold and very well acted.<br /><br />Certainly a serious a provocative subject; a raw and unflinching look at sexual addiction.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|I couldn't stop laughing GREAT movie!! Jason and Jennifer are awesome as well as the rest of the cast! Need to see movie!
B00114RKT8|5.0|Great movie - a good story about a man of true courage and strength. Very inspiring without garbage to sift through!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book had a lot of twists and turns that held my interest.  The story line never got boring but was delivered in such a way that all the characters played a key part in the story.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|One of the best mini-series ever made.  One of the best westerns ever made. On eof the best characters Robert Duval has ever played. the whole cast is very good, but Robvert Duval and Angelica Huston are outstanding.
B002EBDP9G|5.0|Paul Johnson is the \\"Anti-Zinn\\". The book is readable and well sourced. At times rather funny. If I had only one American History book, it would be this.
B0007939NO|4.0|I love the music and dancing in Brigadoon.  Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly are both excellent.  However, this movie shows one that Van Johnson is a pretty good hoofer too.  He and Gene do one number together with a group of Highlanders that is our favorite in the whole movie.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Enjoyed the story and the characters' development. First book I have read but definitely will read as many as are available at my library!
B004AGI2L4|3.0|It was entertaining enough to keep me hooked throughout the movie. I love history so I watched the for the historical aspect of it. The movies accurate in it's portrayal of brutal times of the Roman conquest and of its losses in that conquest.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Totally absorbing, good action, great settings & imagination.enjoyed it. Can not wait to see the 2nd part.love the acting .
B008D36INE|2.0|Didn't make it through the first 5 minutes. I like Rachel, but this was boring at first and i quickly lost interest.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Fantastic film that people love to hate. The strong premise delivers a supernatural mystery with unique characters and a horrifying world.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The slowmo shots are sweet along with the easy level ups. Graphics and scenery are extremely lifelike too. Over all a very addictive game
B009CGAZGW|5.0|One of my absolute favorite holiday movies!  The stars, the singing, the dancing... and a terrific story too!  This movie will always find a spot in my home!
1451666179|5.0|Funniest book I've read in a long time!  Pretty sure I'll get abs of steel laughing as I read the book.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app!  The building I work in has crummy radio reception (too much metal and machinery) - but with this sweet little app on my Kindle - I've got my favorite radio stations available!  A really big plus - it has tons of stations available from pretty much around the world!
B000YMHOUS|4.0|This is basically a social commentary, but the points were valid for today.  Even though this show is set in the past it really asks us to think about the future.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Adobe will not download on my kindle fire hd, I am extremely disappointed.  I have removed it and tried to re-install and nothing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Only down side is having to ask friends to get you into the next level or having to pay to go on...
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The plot and cast is amazing. Quentin Tarantion wrote the script but wasn't well know then so he didn't have the money to direct it.
1577314808|5.0|This book is one of the most positive self help guides I have ever read.  Its simply truth can be applied to any life situation which has created in me amazing changes in attitude.
B002XTBE8I|3.0|Would have have it a 5 if he didn't use the accents. The beats were dope and the lyrics were crazy. Was more of an underground Album. It was great but he kind of went a little overboard with the voice.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|it is a good game to play if you like finding objects and that is my most favorite kind to play
B0051GOB26|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made. John Goodman does an incredible job as Walter. I laughed so many times and still do to this day when I watch it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the most inspiring book I have ever read.  Emotional, riveting and makes you want to get up and go help those guys.  You will not be disappointed.
B0080QOLCE|5.0|This is the worst greatest horror movie I have ever seen. It's so bad it's good. If you go into the movie with no expectations you will love it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Lots of action and some transitions that were not expected while still upholding  the past nuances of &#34;Bond&#34; as we have all grown accustomed.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|This movie is a throwback. It's one of those it's so bad it's good movie. I mean all you have to do is look at the cover and see if it's for you.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and will keep you on the edge of your seat, it show the dark human side which if not put in check ,it will not only damage ourselves but others around us as well. Denzel Washington is a great actor. The only down side foe Amazon is I found this cheaper in Walmart  but Amazon is one of my top places to shop! Thank you
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|So I watched this video on YouTube of this guy doing a Chat Roulette re-enactment of the 'Wrecking Ball' music video. (I highly recommend checking it out, it's freaking hilarious!) Anyway, after watching the parody video a few times, I realized that I actually really liked the song. I came to the Amazon site and listened to the samples. I liked what I heard and decided to buy the album. Most of the tracks sound pretty good in my opinion. I wasn't disappointed in my purchase.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love all of these books and this one ranks right up there with Game of Thrones as far as the entire collection goes.  Excited to see where everything goes from here!
B00821OX98|4.0|Started watching show because we're into series sci fi shows and really like the stories and characters!  There are only a few stories that sometimes don't make sense....
B000FC130E|3.0|It was ok.  I'd say it's an easy read, but it didn't grab me like I expected it to.  I learned after the fact that it was an adaptation from a TV show, possibly that had something to do with it.<br /><br />My feelings: I wouldn't tell anyone not to read it, but I doubt I'll be recommending it to anyone either.
B00CO4CVN4|2.0|The book is about the notes etc. that are on the fretboard. The problem is that the the fretboard diagrams are to small and not dark enough to see where the notes are. I would like to return the book that was sent via the internet to my kindle and buy the Real book and have it shipped to my Redondo Beach address. Can you do that for me?
B007MAETA8|5.0|Well up to his standards. In this release he's addressing some of his Dixie-rock influences, with whiffs of ABB, MTB, the Band, Son Seals etc drifting through it. Melodically a bit simpler than some, but not simple minded at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush and waited so long for Kindle to have the app but now it won't go pass 440 and I'm in need of moving forward....Thanks in advance for the upgrade. I appreciate you Kindle people for working fast to make this possible....Happy Holidays! ;)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|GREAT STORY TOLD BY AN EXPERT STORY TELLER.<br />COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.<br />AS ALWAYS HE BRINGS THE SOUTH TO LIFE.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Why don't I get the booster wheel on my kindle fire hd? It's frustrating, my mom and son got the update but I don't. Other than that, no complaints about this game!
B005LAII0I|5.0|it was in perfection condition and the movie itself was great, i really enjoyed it was fun and kept me entertained
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! The way that it changes the themes like for instance since its Christmas it's got like a wintery London England them. This game Is perfect when or wherever! I love it and you will to!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is definitely a page turner. It has action, politics, and little bit of love too, just for good measure.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|People say that high this game is awesome till like next week but don't get it if it gonna do that. BUY THIS APP I love it u should 2.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I'm going to give this app a 1 star ranking if Amazon doesn't hurry up with the updates! This game is pretty good but I'm sick of waiting for the updates. Apple already has 0.8.0!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a great game for strategic game. It makes you think about if this happened in real life. That's what creeps me out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so fun if you don't<br />have this game ur missing out on a lot. for each season the creaters have the perfect theme its really comes in handy with road trips . so I'm trying  to presrade all the people without this game I personaly think u should get minion rush
B00C061HZY|5.0|Such an amazing album. I couldn't not get it on Vinyl. All of the inserts are interesting and you get a card that lets you digitally download the entire album. I'm no expert, but I believe the download included is higher than usual quality for digital files. So, you save on having to purchase mp3 files.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great detail and story line.  You don't want to put it down...I found myself reading every free minute I could find
B003G4W49C|5.0|This novel has a great plot that keeps control to the very End. The subplots add to rather than compete with the plot. There are very few static characters. Whether good or evil, nearly all develop in diverse directions. There are unfulfilled longings, shattered dreams and great achievements. I felt them with the characters as they happened. I loved, I hated, I wished harm toward and hoped good for the characters. Some of them were realized and some were not. I thought about the questions of justice, ends and means, personal sacrifice, war and manipulation in the story. No easy answers.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|iT'S GOT IT ALL.  PLOT, ACTING, CHARACTERS, PACE.  NEVER LETS YOU DOWN AND KEEPS YOU COMING BACK FOR MORE!  LOVE IT.
1594200823|3.0|The style and content was interesting, but many of the concerns raised were trivial or exaggerated. Read this book several years ago.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|One of the best Denzel performances, pace is really fast and action is pretty scary, glad i'm not flying anytime soon.<br />As for the rating, got a bit fed up with the central character and had to keep saying to myself, he's an alcohalic.  Anyway opinion is just that.  I liked the film but doubt I'd see it again.  Still, good entertainment.  Give it a try.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Best story ever! Can 't put down! Not 5 because story is a little bit contrived and the plot a bit complicated
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|To be honest, I only gave this show a shot because Nathon Fillion is in it, but it really is a good show. I'm looking forward to watching the other seasons now.
1475143389|1.0|As another reviewer said, I too am surprised at the five star ratings this poor book has received. I did not write this to toot my own horn but I want to present my credentials, namely that of a 71 year old certified trainer who bought his first set of Joe Weider weights around 1958, was into aerobics as an instructor by around 1970, an EMT, serious student of physiology and nutrition (grad school courses), and am now certified by NASM and a member of NSCA. As you might expect, I have a large collection of books on this topic, some of them older than most people reviewing this book, so I am going to disagree with the higher rankings.<br /><br />I'm short on time but wanted to say a few words, and hopefully expand this when I have time. First of all, if you are going to publish a book, hire professionals who know what they are doing. If they don't know what &#34;orphans and widows&#34; are in the publishing world, then they don't deserve a dollar, which is the case here. And no professional switches fonts every other paragraph. This is one of the most amateurish books I have ever seen. Where are the quality drawings or photos? The ONLY photograph in the book is a tiny one of the author. Ego unleashed.<br /><br />Then, the author shows amazing immaturity by stating that he is god's gift to muscle development but everyone else is the gym is stupid by comparison. No trainer in my large gym is stupid, or so self-centered, or so inclined to brag. Are any of us perfect? I think not, but we can probably match his knowledge, and have one thing that is an advantage: we know we will always have a lot to learn and won't make the mistake of insulting those who are equally sincere.<br /><br />I simply have not seen anything in this book to aid those of us who care about this effort that is not presented much better in many other books. I mentioned being short on time, which I am, so I hope to later talk about the books you want instead of this one. The only thing that comes to mind for which this author deserves any credit is his &#34;exposure&#34; of the muscle mags, but that's not news to most of us, and once again, before he rants and raves, he needs an editor who can rein him in and help him write like a true professional, not a brash brat.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the best fps you will find. The graphics are great, but the faces could look a little better. Not only does it have a campaign with added upgrades you can get but with the length and story makes it comparable with other console fps. Also has a difficult but really fun multi-player that is global and not like other games where the other players are in the same room as you. It also has ranks so when you hit rank 50 it offers you a new challenge where you go back to rank 1 with a new looking rank, you can do this I don't know how many times because I haven't even made it that far. This game is worth 15$.<br /><br />Pros: Multiplayer, Graphics, Campaign, Weapons.<br /><br />Cons: Multiplayer can get a little laggy when joining a game, The faces need some form of expressions.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|Great Movie, I love the story line, this movie I could watch several times it's so inspiring, I love the message in the movie and what it portrays. I would say a must see film.
B000ID37KO|5.0|I  would give a billion stars for the film The Birds.  The story, acting, and editing of the film<br />is so fantastic.  Words cannot even express it's greatness.  It is scary but in a bearable<br />way.<br />Thank you
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|arthur christmas is a fun dvd to have around to watch for the holiday season.  kids seem to enjoy it.  like the combo packs the best when purchasing movies.
B009NNMB70|5.0|This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. I want to see thus movie a lot more because I am a huge directioner. I love then soooooooo much
B006MW3V6U|5.0|can't say enough good things about this show. One of my favorites. If you like this, try out The Paradise, another PBS show.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|How did I go 30 years and never read this book. Saw all the movies of course, but I may have to start reading this every year.
0307010856|5.0|I bought this for my kiddo. She is only 10 months right now, so could care less at this point, but it was a favorite of mine growing up and I'm glad I found it for my kid.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|fabulous book!<br />fabulous writer<br />Can't wait to read more of her through the years!<br />I am telling all my friends!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|Totally unexpected. A good flick,watch it if you have the time. It fits with few lapses and delivers Me thinks you'll like it!
B001QERPDO|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.  I liked some of the songs also.  Good buy for this CD.
B00DURHYWC|2.0|Originally Pink Martini had distinctive world-class chasons and caberet music...now it's lapsing in to soft pop that bores rather than invigorates.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ugh. Boring. Repetitive garbage. Laughable. Where is a story line? Characters are not believable. I realize there are ignorant people but I don't have to waste time reading about it.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Detailed court preparation. Slow at times. Characters were well developed. Too much emphasis on grand finale at last minute to sway the jury.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The story is so good it is hard to put it down.  An easy read.  John Grisham always write about interesting cases.
B003B02O0A|4.0|John Grisham is always good.  This is his first book and the last one &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; now on the best seller is a follow up (and even better).
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time now! I'm not tired of it yet!  I hadn't heard of it until I caught the first 15 minutes of it at a friend's house, but it left me interested.  Eventually bought it to see the rest, and I was not disappointed!  I love the morals, my kids love the characters (ok, me too) and the jokes are great.
B000FA675C|4.0|A superb story I read years ago and then again recently.  Dan Brown's best book.  The following ones are not up to the same standard.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|Very funny movie recommended by some friends of mine at work. I was certainly not disappointed. My wife and I were both surprised we didn't hear more about such a funny movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book.  Very well written and a story which is difficult to forget.  It is very sad but also inspiring.  I don't understand the what the title means.  Seems to have nothing to do with the book.
0761158820|5.0|We found out about these when I had to take my kids into work with me for about 2 hours due to an unmissable meeting. My coworker kept this book in her desk for these types of scenarios. When my meeting was over I came back to my kids building these on the floor by my office. Months later my oldest still has the first one he built proudly displayed on his dresser.<br /><br />Pros: The kids (8 and 4) liked the creations, not cheap paper but thicker bonded creations, lots of different monsters to create.<br /><br />Cons: None so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun! I was worried about getting it because of all the hype but it truly is addictive and so much fun!!!
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|This show seems to be building too slowly and going down hill. I find myself being dragged along with a story and not eagerly in front of it. I suppose we get one surprise or exciting episode per season it seems. This show has stagnated in my opinion.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|The panda is really cute when you open the door.  Cool app and free. Don't dress up as a moose for hunting season.

B00845PT18|2.0|Was not as good as the first movie. Was harder to follow. Not as enjoyable. Could not fully climb on board this move. First movie was much better. Not very good.

0802473156|5.0|This book may have saved my marriage. This book was recommended to me by my marriage counselor. I bought a copy for my wife and one for me. I used it as a study guide and found myself high-lighting much of the information. I only wish This book was made available to me forty years ago.

B00C2FFJFM|4.0|I reviewed, Selena's previous album &#34;When The Sun Goes Down&#34; which came out in 2011. Also the album was released with her band, The Scene. In 2012, Selena decided to focus on her acting career. In 2013, She starred in 2 films. Spring Breakers & Getaway. In July she released, Stars Dance. It is her 4th album overall. It is her first solo album and maybe her last. The album was released, July 23, 2013. The album was released the day after Selena's 21st birthday.<br />1. Birthday - a catchy, upbeat, & edgy song. Great way to open the album! - 8/10<br />2. Slow Down - catchy, upbeat, fun to sing and dance to. - 10/10<br />3. Stars Dance - Slow & Catchy but not my favorite on the album. - 6/10<br />4. Like a Champion - a catchy dance song! - 8/10<br />5. Come & Get It - upbeat dance song! - 10/10<br />6. Forget Forever - upbeat & fun dance song - 9/10<br />7. Save The Day - upbeat and another dance song - 9/10<br />8. B.E.A.T - catchy but not my favorite - 5/10<br />9. Write Your Name - another catchy song, but takes a while to get into. - 7/10<br />10. Undercover - Another upbeat catchy song. Sing & Dance to it! - 8/10<br />11. Love Will Remember - Heartfelt, Beautiful Song! - 10/10<br /><br />Overall, I still give this album 4/5 Stars. My favorite Selena Gomez album has to be &#34;When The Sun Goes Down&#34; i guess because there was more songs I liked. On this album there was still great songs and I don't deny that.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed the characters in this book. The writing is very good and the plot, is thought provoking. I will most likely read more of Liane Moriarty's books.
B004ZN9R6G|2.0|I had listened to this LP back in the 70's and thought I might like to have a CD of it since I no longer have a turntable. The music was not as well received this time around. Of course this might have had something to my state of mind in the 70's<br />Still... the CD arrived as promised, and plays well.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Awesome. Only gripe is it takes FOREVER to download!!! BTW, does any one know if Tobuscus and/or Pewdie plays this??? Either way, I dunno.
B0009UC81A|5.0|Was a gift????
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I downloaded this game because I missed my Zoo Tycoon game. It is a fairly good comparison to it and I have enjoyed it thus far. However, I don't like the gas gauge in the wilderness search.
B00FATEJYE|3.0|I keep trying to play the game but it goes back to the homepage  and won't let me play it it gets annoying
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun, addicting, easy to play.<br /><br />Should allow the option to sell old guns, downgrade etc to buy new guns or modify to suit your hunting needs.
B003MC5N28|3.0|20  years ago.  I looked it up because I KNEW I had read this book in the long ago and far away.  Of course, once started I had to finish.  Very simplistic.  Not bad but not great either.  This is what our current politics will do for us.  We must all be the same.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|It's a great TV show you forget you are watching the small screen.  The acting seems to be done very well although I am no critic and the story line is inventive.
B000W0B09I|5.0|Bill Evans would score another blockbuster hit with this magnificent live album that<br />  was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1968, the same year it was released to<br />  rave reviews.  A Grammy Award winner for Best Jazz Instrumental for Group Or Solo<br />  Performance (for a second time), At The Montreux Jazz Festival would give the critics<br />  and listeners a wonderful and thrilling experience that you would come to expect from<br />  an ambitious live jazz album.  This masterpiece feature a different trio that consists of<br />  two rising young players: noted session bassist Eddie Gomez and drummer Jack De-<br />  Johnette, hardly the ideal man for the event, as the trio push the live performance into<br />  it’s most exhilarating form.  The superb track listing would not only include versions of<br />  standards, including A Sleeping Bee, Nardis, The Touch Of Your Lips and Quiet Now,<br />  but fresh compositions, like One For Helen, Mother Of Earl and Walkin’ Up, so thanks<br />  to the trio’s fresh originality and in part of DeJohnette--who was hardly their ideal man<br />  for the position, the trio pushes Evans into his caliber form.  As the critic Brian Priestly<br />  (who saw the trio in action) writes in the liner notes, the live album “provided historical<br />  perspective on Bill Evan’s stellar performances with these amazingly complementary”<br />  sidemen, which would describe the timeless merit and artistic beauty of this landmark<br />  masterpiece.  An intriguing facet of this set is the way he performs the ballad material<br />  alone so well on I Loves You, Porgy and Quiet Now, while the trio sway right through<br />  the live set.  Produced with class and honour by Helen Keane, At The Montreux Jazz<br />  Festival will always remain as timeless and spellbinding as ever.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have a kindefire hex, I have had the weather channel from my tv, to my first cell ,and now on my kindefire. I love it and have never had any other weather channel on any of my electronics. I was so happy to find the app for it, thank you!!
B000UBMWPU|5.0|While Bill Evans kept impressing audiences and jazz fans with his sophisticated         piano stylings and trio-backed excellence, he scored another great hit album on the         jazz charts when he welcomed several jazz masters to join him on this jam session         that turned out to be a rewarding labour of love to those who have participated in it.         Released in 1977, Quintessence delivers a fantastic jam session which feature Lee         Konitz, the connoisseur of cool and the avant-garde; Kenny Burrell, the great guitar         virtuoso; Ray Brown, a meastro on the bass; and Philly Joe Jones on the drums for         a time-honoured performance with The Bill Evans Trio.  Backed by a solid track set         containing a fresh round of original compositions, like Sweet Dulcina Blue, Martina,         and pop- jazz standards, like The Second Time Around, Kenny Burrell’s Bass Face         and A Child Is Born until ending sweetly on the final track take on Nobody Else But         Me, which make this modern classic a fascinating and exhilarating achievement as         he again mystifies the listeners with a breezy set of unexpected timbres and tones.         Quintessence have also provided some to answer as to what Bill Evans would had         done if he recorded with a larger band from his later years? The answer: He would         have made an amiable and not especially a interesting recording date, but instead,         he handled this with such unique excellence and success.  Thanks to the enduring         interplay from the five jazz masters and the and the elaborate homespun virtuosity         of this special masterwork, this is a timeless stroke of genius that is ranked as one         of Evans’ best and most important achievements.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|great remastering of a their work. This is a great package for sure. And those who complain about it , say it's too loud. It's not really. It's in their head probably as they are used to hearing many of these songs in mono. Because now you can really hear all the instruments on each song. That's quality not loudness. So if you love the beatles and I do , then this is a must have for you. As it's their major released tracks and that's a good thing. Live at the Hollywood bowl.  is missing. It's not a good thing but that has not been released anywhere so...  If  you like this band then  you should grab this boxset. It's clear and well done.
B000W06U20|5.0|Just as Bill Evans successfully entered the 1970’s, when The Jazz-Rock Movement<br />  had shook up the music, the great jazz pianist stunned listeners when he briefly added<br />  the electric piano to his music while mostly maintains his true piano-oriented virtuosity.<br />  When From Left To Right first came out in 1970, it gave the listeners a new sound that<br />  nobody had come to expect from Bill Evans: playing the Fender-Rhodes electric piano<br />  and the Steinway piano during the entire session where he skillfully switched from one<br />  instrument to another—and back again without losing his world class virtuosity.  While<br />  maintaining his highly sophisticated ‘jazz piano’ artistry and refusing to take part in the<br />  Jazz-Rock Movement of the 1970’s, Bill Evans impressed jazz fans and the critics with<br />  this dynamic keyboard performances, which is backed by an orchestra and a track list,<br />  including What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life, I’m All Smiles, Why Did I Chose<br />  You, Soiree as well as a couple superb original songs--One For Helene and Children’s<br />  Play Song.  But it’s a superb version on The Dolphin he presents both before and after<br />  two tracks, which the flutes, strings and percussion is innovatively overplayed where it<br />  epitomizes the singular entry in Evans’ celebrated discography. Though overlooked by<br />  some, we can all enjoy From Left To Right, which showcases his lyrical and refreshing<br />  musical experience filled with skillful empathy and sheer easy-listening vibe that make<br />  it so unforgettable.  With inventor Harold Rhodes’ paying a special tribute to Bill Evans<br />  on the album, From Left To Right is digitally-remastered in its expanded format as four<br />  quartet bonus tracks are included, which make it a timeless bonafide classic.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very hard to get into. I was half-way thru the book, and all the sub-plots were still not making sense. I couldn't even finish this book it was so bad. Her other book, The Cuckoo's Calling, is much better.
B0014ESMCY|5.0|As the 1960’s dawned, Bill Evans was already one of the biggest young stars on<br />  the jazz scene and hailed as one of the most highly influential jazz pianists in music<br />  history.  The time-honoured masterpiece Portrait In Jazz, released in 1960, present<br />  him with his with his permanent working trio which had consisted of Paul Motian on<br />  the drums and Scott La-Faro on the bass, when they would form a fluid artistry and<br />  interdependence, as they developed and forever change the face of the jazz piano.<br />  Introducing a new set of notions that consists of shading balances and poetic lyrical<br />  Virtuosity, performed with world class style.  This timeless versatile trio masterpiece<br />  showcases a set of bonafide versions of standards like Come Rain Or Come Shine,<br />  Witchcraft and even Someday My Prince Will Come—made famous by Miles Davis<br />  in 1961), as well as on fresh ‘new’ original compositions like the self-penned classic<br />  Peri’s Scope and the final track Blue In Green (in which he had co-wrote with Miles<br />  on the landmark album Kind Of Blue from 1959).  Plus you would get the mono and<br />  stereo versions of Autumn Leaves (Ahmad Jamal also gave a striking trio reindition<br />  of the song and Roger Williams also scored his breathtaking classical-oriented Top<br />  Ten hit on pop and classical charts in 1957), and the Miles/ Evans modal signature<br />  hit Blue In Green.  If there were any lingering doubts about his stature or remaining<br />  barriers of his recognition to Evans, then Portrait In Jazz (beautifully remastered in<br />  it’s complete CD format) should make it obviously clear that the early-1960’s would<br />  his time, which will always remain as fresh and vibrant as ever.
B00FXMGI0G|3.0|Good popcorn flick if that's what you're looking for. It's a reprise of the first film. It has some nice character touches, good acting and some good moments of humor. Extensive action scenes. What it lacks -- the story doesn't add anything to the first film, doesn't build on it or tell us anything we don't already know - it just continues the first film. I'm always suspicious with a film starts with an action hero living an &#34;ordinary&#34; life and feeling restless. The last time that worked was at the opening of Moby Dick. Worth a rental but maybe not a purchase.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this for my dad, who is a cat person. Its a hilarious book and I would totally recommend this for any cat person.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Great CD! Gaga's a really talented artist and she ventured out a little more with this album. Most songs are really great, while others take some time to appreciate. Nonetheless, give the album a try. It won't disappoint in the end!
B0068RQ85K|4.0|I know that this product is a good one but I haven't used it yet. My friend has one that I saw her use.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you use IPad and Amazon Instant Video, then don't buy it. This product supports very few Apps and has too much restrictions. I don't believe that Google has any technical difficulty to make this device more useful. I do believe that Google purposely prices it low to promote only a few Apps. Nothing wrong, but I don't like it.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|This is a fun game. It keeps me up and thinking about it all day. A must have game if like you like Tower Defense games.
B00EB9Z9Z2|5.0|I always find the answer to the question I am asking when I just get out of my own way. This book reinforces what I know is the answer to all the questions I have been asking since I first read The Secret. If I just stop and listen, let go, believe, then the answer is there. It is in how I view what may seem to be a obstacle and the way I react that helps me to be a better person. My goal or desire can be a large or small one, just has to be mine not someone else's.<br />This book brings such a confirmation of the answer to love and be grateful for all the things that you find on your path. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Must see for all Americans. Eye opening! Maybe we should take day trips to Cuba when we aren't feeling well.
B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|I can never find this darn app. When I want to use a calculator I look in the C's not the P's. The programmers must of had their reasons to use this name, but it is a no go for me.<br /><br />I might give it another rating if I ever use it enough to find out.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|It's been a month or so since I finished this book and I have been religiously following the workout plan up until last week were I switched from the 5 day a week workout to the 3 to 4 day a week alternative.<br />A no nonsense, no BS book on how to get you the body you want with no unrealistic promises or crazy workout routines. Whilst I have not noticed any physical changes yet, I do feel stronger already and have been increasing some weights, so trust the rest will follow.<br />Don't expect any miracles. You'll have to work your butt off and discipline yourself to eat correctly. The good thing is you'll know you won't be wasting your time on some bogus workout routine which promises results in just a few weeks. Stick to the plan and you will meet your goals. It may sound tough initially, but allow yourself a few weeks to get used to the workout routine and it will get significantly easier to follow.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|The high definition reproduction looks amazing on a wide screen TV.  This is a fantastic set to commemorate the movie and the commentaries are very interesting.
B009BJAZBA|3.0|This series is slightly entertaining. I'm not sure what I expected but it became clear that this was not it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Certainly not as scary as the first one but still was a great story. I love how he went back and gave a picture of Dan's life in the last thirty years, made his character believable and appealing. Great read!
B00EVW04PE|1.0|Very disappointing.  When it ended, my husband & I just looked at one another, wondering why we bothered renting this movie.  I wasn't sure if t was meant to be a drama, a comedy, or a little bit of both.  Everyone running in all directions, the White House totally falling in pieces & on fire behind them, being chased by who knows who, & still, the little wise ass comments meant to be humorous - or maybe not.  The end reminded me of some sort of fantacy, where through it all, everyone lives happily ever after.  A total disaster.  These actors must be desperate for work to do a movie like this.
0743270754|5.0|Best book on Lincoln I have read because Goodwin provides excellent context into the rival characters that surrounded Lincoln and how he played them like a piano to serve his ends and end slavery.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Very anticipated book. I was let down by the book. It was not as good as the rest, but I don't regret reading it.
B002WD4MLG|3.0|Good movie story on the realities of Hollywood. Cast is outstanding and likely delivered such great performances because the scenes were all at one time real-life events.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Good wireless headphones. It has a decent charge and good audio quality. Wireless connectivity is good most of the time, and range is good. Can walk to another room and still have a connection. Microphone is good quality.<br /><br />Steep price though, and the USB dock and its cable management system isn't exactly high quality. Dock doesn't really store the wires properly because the plastic extrusions don't extrude enough so that the gap between them is thinner than the wire itself. Occasional connectivity issue. Surround sound works well, but its just virtual headphone surround sound, and the sound quality dips a bit when switching to surround sound. Padding on the top could definitely be thicker, it gets squished into a pancake within a minute.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the way all the characters lives were intertwined and that it was in Australia. Great read that was hard to put down
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Very fun game but pretty ridiculous that you have a fixed number of lives and then once they are up, you have to wait a day to play. I'm not interested in going on facebook for friend help and I won't pay for extra stuff so I just hop to another game once my lives are over.  There is a challenge to pass (3 steps) for each level and once one is done you can't move to the next for a fixed amount of time.<br /><br />I'd prefer a game you can play whenever you want.
0316069884|5.0|Not to sound melodramatic, but reading this book really did change my life.  It's not all phony sounding and fake, the author sounds real.  Reading it is like listening to a friend telling a story.  And honestly at first, reading it didn't change anything.  I sat eating chicken for dinner while I read it.  It was after I was done when I really thought about it I became a vegetarian.  The book does not try to convince you to be one though, it is unbiased.  Foer's intention is just to enlighten us to the injustices of factory farming.
0345803485|5.0|I got this book for my wife. I didn't read one word of this book, but I reaped the benefits. She did say some of it was corny.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome game I love it!!! I spend many hours playing this game and so does my girlfriend it is very cool.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Great movie with a good plot.  I enjoyed seeing Danny Devito in a serious role.  There are great court scenes.
034580404X|5.0|Its a book I couldn't put down, have already read Book 1 and couldnt wait to get wait for the rest to get here..
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|it had good grapahics and the best campain it was awesome so cool. it was like call of duty black ops 2
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game.You can make a ugly princess a beautiful princess.I have it because I wanted to have a makeover  game.I recommend this game to girls 4 and up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Intensifying yet again, the third season of Downtown Abbey pushed new boundaries, had gritty and terrible plot turns, and continued to dimensionalize characters. I love this quality series.<br />Mk
B005VPRDAY|5.0|These are the small piece Legos. When I have work to do I pull these out for my rand daughter and they keep her busy for a couple hours. The tote is great for storage and will accommodate many many more Lego pieces from future purchases.
B00109T5WY|5.0|The blending of musical melodies engulf you as the music prigresses. It's AWESOME! I love this group and creative music. No vocals, just instrumentation.
0449227545|1.0|My least favorite of all the Ken Follett books I have read, and I have read most of them.  To begin with, the story is unbelievable and then it wanders around.  Disappointed in this one.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is my favorite TV program. While it is being rerun on local TV stations, I can watch any episode anytime I wish to do so. I have all six seasons.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This was an excellent read.  A young Duke was smoking behind a sofa blowing smoke out the window and behind drapes when a young woman came into the room.  He was quiet thinking she would soon leave.  When two men were heard about to come into the room, she scurried behind the sofa to hide.  The men were looking for her.  One indicated he was going to marry her and she would suit as she was like a rodent go be quiet and he could take her off the shelf when he wanted her and put her back when he didn't' t want go be bothered.  He figured he could have mistresses Nd she wouldn't' complain and if she did he could toss her out.  As she got up she saw the Duke just above her.  He had a good look down the front of her dress.<br /><br />She had a secret that could ruin her.  Her friendships did as well.  Minnie or Wilhelmina tried not to be seen and be that mouse or rodent but she was a very intelligent woman with s good sense of humor.  A Mr Stewart was trying to cause trouble and was checking her out a bit.  His attitude was nasty.  What would he find?  He was missing the secret but he was trying to hurt her reputation.  It was certainly a good book to read.  I have read the book about Lydia as well and it was excellent as well.  Enjoy!
0142418471|5.0|John Green is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers and Will Grayson, Will Grayson one of my favorite books.  Throughly enjoyed this book and rarely do I want a book to spring from the pages and come to life.  However, this book I couldn't help but long to not just read it but project it into musical form.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Since it is free it should be no problem to play.  Very fun can pay and not get bored. Challenging but not impossible.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|Here is a reason why, it is written in a tone that is a pleasure to read every word.<br /> That's it.
B004GYY714|2.0|This app is pretty good in terms of ease of use. However, (don't we all hate the howevers) the app had issues when I listened to a certain station for 30 minutes or so. The app would freeze and make me close it. After closing the app I would try again only to have it make me close the app again.<br /> Please fix these issues TuneIn. It was an enjoyable app until it got the bugs.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Tartt is a great story teller. She really pulls you into the characters and has you thinking about them,long after you've made yourself put it down for the night, wanting to read more.  I really enjoyed this book.
B00GTZJLAK|2.0|Does not live up to all the hype :( Cute but once is enough. Not very funny..Glad we just rented first before we bought...we will not be adding this movie to our collection.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this app is so much fun, i love it.<br />i played it in my computer but when i saw it in my Kindle i just had to download it
031262820X|5.0|This book was one of my favorite Madeleine Wickham books.  Very sweet and well done.  Enjoyable read!!  I just wish the audible CD was narrated by a &#34;better&#34; voice...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, GRISHAM keeps the flow of great story telling going from the first sentence to the final page.<br />A very fun read.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time now.  I have seen this movie in the theatre and just had to buy it.  It's my go-to movie when I have the house to myself, there's nothing good on TV (and I have a mountain of laundry to do!) or any number of other reasons why I would &#34;need&#34; to pop this movie into the machine.  The only downside to this movie is the Samantha storyline.  It was so sexed up it was pretty near porn, and just seemed a little desperate for attention.  Good thing with a DVD you can skip the stupid parts of movies.  However, I still LOVE this movie.  :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Just an excellent book! I loved it so much! It made me laugh,cry, get mad and happy. For anyone who hasn't read this you need to. Simply a great ending to one of the best series I have ever read. Can't wait for the movie in 2014!
1436121329|1.0|This book was so disappointing.  I love Charlotte Parry's narration voice but it was too &#34;Americanized&#34; here.  The book it itself needs more plot.  I could not even finish reading or listening to it.  Don't waste your money.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Watch did a great job with this album, even though some people say that Unstoppable Momentum reminds them to the first albums, like &#34;the extremist&#34; or &#34;flying in a blue dream&#34; I don't know if that's true. This is something completely different but in a good way.<br /><br />Personally I haven't enjoyed an album like this in a long time, in my opinion is not as good as &#34;flying in a blue dream&#34; but that's my favorite album ever so it is very hard for me to say it is that good, don't get me wrong this is an incredible experience that anyone who likes good music must hear.<br /><br />If you follow my advice and buy it you won't regret it
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Fantastic read - intelligently written and riveting story. Would be a thrilling movie. It was one of those books you never want to finish - definitely ready for a sequel!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Nice app, it is entertaining but just for a while, but I can't complain because I got it for free this black Friday
B009GEPPYC|5.0|I love this movie!!!The best thing about this movie are the songs.. I was young in the 80's, but the music is just awesome
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|This is a long-awaited new release for Sting. It has an overall blue-collar feel for shipworkers in Britain. The tunes are very nice and he includes other voices which really add to the listening enjoyment. I also like that there are so many songs (2 discs) which makes it a great value. I can listen to this for hours.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game it's a must for any kindle. Although it can become very addictive . I have run out of things to say but have to meet a word count
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This device did not work! Maybe I just got a bad device. The following features are absolutely broken in my device.<br />  - Casting youtube videos from iPad or iPhone<br />  - Casting Netflix videos from iPad<br />  - Casting Chrome tab from PC<br /><br />I hope all these scenarios are fixed in the next version of the device.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Cool little app!  I've outlived my kindle battery three times before having to put it down and just walk away...
B00F3NX4C0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bowie albums, but when it was originally released I was buying CDs, not vinyl. I've been rebuilding my LP collection in recent years, and when I heard Earthling was being reissued on vinyl, I had to buy a copy, and I'm glad I did. This pressing sounds excellent, and it's dead quiet. The vinyl is heavy, and the packaging is well done, with a gatefold cover and a full color inner sleeve for the album itself.<br /><br />One caution: I purchased the blue vinyl version and received the green version. I don't care, but if it matters to you, be aware that either the description is wrong or the folks in Amazon's shipping department aren't particularly careful (a sticker on the outer wrapper indicates the color of the vinyl, so it's not exactly a guessing game). I've read that the green version is rarer, so there are probably some people who will say I lucked out. Whatever the case, I highly recommend this album and this release in any color.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS WAS SO GREAT, I'M GLAD AMAZON LETS KINDLES GET IT. NOW JUST LET US GET POKEMON AND ILL LOVE AMAZON EVEN MORE.!&lt;3
B000002H1T|5.0|A lot of great songs in one album that isn't even a greatest hits album. &#34;Drive&#34; alone makes it all worthwhile. And then you get all the rest. Recommend it for sure.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I lived through this time.  Excellent story well told.  Ben Affleck -- great job job on content and acting.  Thanks
B002VECLVO|5.0|I wasn't even sure what the movie was about. Kept hearing great things about it. Yeah wow! Can't tell you how many times I've watched it already. Beautiful, so, so, heartbreaking. Hope I'm not giving anything away if you haven't seen it. Highly, highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed in the least!
B003XDZMFE|4.0|These are really cute and comfy, I plan on buying at least another pair in black. I like how the straps hold the shoes firmly on my foot.
B000002LK1|5.0|If you love Depeche you'll love every song on this album. Still one of first go to's when I want to put on some good music to listen to after all these years. The best
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good way to kill an hour or two.  Limited number of levels so you'll finish the game quickly.  Keep it around for a short trip.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a young(er) woman just starting out in my dream career, I found this book to be very inspiring and motivating! And though she didn't explicitly talk about race in the workplace, a lot of the advice seems to apply to me as a racial minority as well. It's a good book. Well worth the read!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time!  Its well written and the characters are well developed and the plot captivating.  I love that it is written with death as the narrator.  I'm sure the movie will ruin that.....
B009ME47H2|5.0|I've found that the recorder works fine when picking up voices at a distance and with some ambient noise. I used it to make a recording to write as a transcript and I was able to hear everything very clearly.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Well..... I saw some reviews made from the kindle fire, its free, and regular youtube is majorly messed up.  So I bought it. Aaaaand it wont install on my kindle fire. *Sigh* 'nuff said
B001P06GX4|5.0|We enjoy this game so much!! (with my five years old boy, and my wife)<br />We start to enjoy it since day one it arrived!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan my whole life and this was a perfect follow up for little Dan. I am so glad that Mr. King did this book I read the shinning and loved it and I have thought what ever came of Dan and Wendy. We all have thought that because Mr. King writes about characters we care about leaving us wanting more. I was a little bit put out by the price (9.99) but I paid the price and glad that I did, great book that has the dark, sick demented characters that we all love. Buy this one you will not be sorry, scared and sleeping with the lights on, but not sorry.  Beware the Hat!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics, realistic physics and weapons, and cool missions. Hands down one of the best games for Kindle. Highly recommended.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|couldn't hear the alarm once i set it. I had the volume all the way up but it was still incredibly quiet. Needs to be changed.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|The transfer to Blu ray looks great, plus this is one of my favorite movies!  one of the best ever!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is always interesting to find out what happened from someone who was there more than a historian who comes along later and sees it from another point of view.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game was only a dollar.... WoW! This game is totally worth your money. It's fun and adventurous. I'd say it's the best game on my kindle. IT'S FUN AND COOL AT THE SAME TIME IT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE A DOLLAR!!
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I enjoyed reading about this woman but I'm a lot older than her and seemed to have had my own struggles to get where I went in life and succeeded, would recommend it for the young and CEOs
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I loved the Bridget Jones books and was worried about revisiting them so many years later, but Helen Fielding has stayed true to her heroine while adding even more heart to her story. This book had me laughing out loud one minute, in tears the next. Hated for it to end!
0375869026|5.0|Soooo Good! I Would Recommend It For Mature 8 - 9 Year Olds & Any 10 - Infinity Year Olds! Its Gets A Little Emotional!
B009NRO5XE|5.0|I haven't listened to this yet, was saving for a gift, but decided to keep..I have heard tracks on utube, I'm sure I'll like it. I like the concept very much and the sincerity of the project
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Starts out well. Haven't played it enough yet to provide a thorough review. So far it seems to be fun and we will buy the unlocked version.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|The movie is very good - full of action! The only thing is it froze alot while watching because of the movie speed vs download speed.
098478280X|5.0|As far as interviews go, I would be totally lost without this book. With this book, I am still lost, but not nearly as much! The interview process is by all means very bizarre. This book covers everything, from what to wear to how companies decide whether to hire you or not.<br /><br />There are interesting and not so interesting questions, but that's more reflective of the interview material than anything else. Nevertheless, no matter the question the solutions given are very well written and explained in depth. It's a shame that they are written in Java mainly because I feel like Java makes things harder to understand by requiring so much fluff, thus making it much farther from pseudocode than something like Python, but Java is also a highly sought after language so there's that.<br /><br />While I think this book is much better for those who already have gained the knowledge of data structures and algorithms and just need some brushing up or practice, it could easily serve as a useful resource for those who want to cram the material. Not that I recommend that.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a must read for those who don't understand how the interview process works. It's especially useful because all companies want different things, and while that forces the book to be nonspecific, it makes it so that you have a very hard time figuring out what is going on if you are on your own.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book is awful; I just wish I could give it zero stars.  Veronica Roth must be a mean person to give us two awesome books and then write this.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Why does this free version have the NEW update but not the PAID version? ???????? How much since does that make?
1577312082|5.0|It is and was a very good product
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Overview:<br /><br />It's a fun movie for mecha buffs, and a decent action film overall. However you don't want to think about the plot too much, because it's very prone to nitpicking. It also needed to be less visually busy at spots, because it can make battles into a murky mess.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />The mecha look fantastic, and are animated well. I don't think any non-animated picture has as well done mecha, and it has some nice set pieces to show them off. As a form of &#34;real&#34; giant robot, they are well designed and would make excellent models.<br /><br />Nice battles between mecha and kaiju. They strike the right balance between lumbering and dynamic. The scale is nice, too; these critters are big, and they lay waste to cities when they fight.<br /><br />Lovely backgrounds, whether it's the construction site of a massive wall designed to keep the kaiju in, or Hong Kong, or a decimated Japan.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Many of the battles are too busy visually, and can be hard to make out. Both water and nighttime are often used to obscure things it feels like.<br /><br />The kaiju aren't as well done as the mecha, being too similar too each other. A lot of times you can't see them clearly either, and it takes away from their menace. More scenes like the one in Japan would have been awesome, because then you really get the dread you were looking for.<br /><br />The plot...well, it tries to pay homage to anime tropes without coherence. A lot of things just happen. I think some of them are subtle homages: the analog/digital thing with Gypsy Danger has to be a nod to Giant Robo: The Day the Earth Stood still, as Robo also faced an emp pulse that only he could survive because he was nuclear and not Shizuma drive equipped., and he was one of the older models in his line too. However, most scenes don't have enough explanation to avoid the dreaded &#34;C'mon, why did they do that?&#34;<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are fine, but you can't have semi-realistic low tech fighting on the one hand, and neural handshaking or robots surviving 50k feet drops on the other. It needed to either be more over the top, or more realistic. It combines the two, and when you add in the live-action focus, it seems a lot more incoherent plot-wise than it should.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I liked watching it, but it's just okay. It's probably the best live-action mecha film out there, but even still it's hampered by busy fights and some serious plot issues. Definitely worth a rental, a purchase not so much.t have semi-realistic low tech fighting on the one hand, and neural handshaking or robots surviving 50k feet drops on the other.

0143143492|5.0|It is and was a very good product
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|Great comedy and satire, especially considering when it was made.  One of my favorites movies of all time.  Great acting as well.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|A decent movie, entertaining and moves well. But you certainly have to suspend your belief to imagine these magicians being about to accomplish all this. We believed the Mission Impossible team (TV series) could pull off such stunts, as it was more realistic. But I was entertained, and that's what movies are supposed to do.
B000S9WLBY|5.0|This isn't a complex story, and of course the ending isn't much of a surprise. I'm in my sixties, and my generation grew up on war movies, so the idea that under the pressure of combat essential character appears is pretty familiar...but this kind of movie, with the focus on people, not the battle of ideas or a lone hero against everyone or lots of explosions, hasn't been made in a while. It's subtitled.
B000VLE3GA|3.0|It is just OK.  This re-master in my opinion has taken some of the &#34;punch&#34; out of the originals. My all time favorite song from Zep,:&#34;Kashmir&#34; seems to have less of a sonic presence.  Buy this is you are not really a Led Zeppelin fan but just want to have some zeppelin in your collection.
B002DQLGHU|4.0|The movie is a fun adventure that is great for all ages. Particularly fun for young kids, but you can definitely watch it as a family film. Can get tiring after the first few times, though.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I am not much of a reader and all I can say is that I could not stop reading this book, I recommend all Castle fans to buy this book.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|If you like the original &quot;Cut the Rope&quot;, you will love this game!  This game is amazing!  It is worth the money!
B009RR8BZI|5.0|I thought the first book was pretty good, this one was even better there were times where I was reading 3 chapters at once, can not wait to read the third one. As I said before if you are Castle fans you should buy this book as well
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|This game is the most challenging game I have plated by this company. The graphics are ok, but it's eerie! I have jumped several times and I'm not that far into it yet! I will definitely buy this game!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is so much fun and very addicting... at points it might seem impossible to pass the levels but it's worth it.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Visually stunning and an excellent Sci-Fi.  I thought it was far better than many critics said.  Engaging, with good twists, and an interesting study of ______.  I won't say, but the issue that becomes central to the story after the suprise reveal is thoughtfully explored in this movie.  I highly recommend.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's awesome!!! I just love it. It's so cool. I hope it gets more and more stuff. All my friends love it to.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|A beautiful movie with a decent story, but something was missing that kept it from being great.  I liked father and son working together.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|I enjoyed the music.  I like the way the story developed and the ending was kind of a surprise to me.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Excellent first installment in the trilogy, although the theatrical version is the best.  However, the included statue is one of the best I've seen and well worth the money to add to your collection.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The traumatic events of three women's lives are woven together in ways they could never imagine.  A very good book with an ending that is better than one would imagine.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|As a fan of The Wizard of Oz, I was skeptical on how well Disney could pull this off, but I was amazed.  it was wonderful.  Unique with some good twists for TWoZ fans, but it also paid excellent homage to the original in all the right ways.  2D or 3D are both good, but the 3D isn't absolutely necessary to the story.  I hope Disney makes more.  James Franco was good, but I thought Mila Kunis nailed her character.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of the best books in the world. It really highlights catnaps views on &#34;friends&#34;, the Capitol, and several other people, etc
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|An absolutely amazing and realistic study of what it would have been like to go through the tsunami.  Some complain that the focus of this movie is too narrow and does not tell us enough about the overall tragedy.  I believe this view completely missed the point.  The focus of the movie is narrow because that is what happens when you are in a disaster.  You only experience your small corner and do not know what is going on.  This movie communicates that narrow experience very well while also, in that very narrow experience, helps you to understand the wider tragedy.  Absolutely excellent.  Well written, well acted, with awesome cinematography.
0399255370|5.0|Personifying the crayons will meet a child's imagination. It charmed my adult mind.<br /><br />Each crayon is just a little different, has his or her own voice. The solution which Duncan, the crayons' owner, reaches is the best!
B00ECR7L0Y|4.0|A good version of Shakespeare's humorous play using modern settings, but the original language.  It mostly works and is worth the watch.  Good casting helps this one succeed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Wonderful way to keep in touch with the weather. Always accurate and reliable. Great to use especially during the hurricane season.
B00DMK6WN4|4.0|It's Pixar.  What else needs to be said.  Monsters University is a sequel, therefore it is somewhat repetitive, but the humor is good, the new characters charming, and the story flows nicely to a good conclusion.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|When I first got the app I was exited but when you try to do the hunting season it's basically impossible to win the moose hunting level when it is on fasterer so I highly recommend that you get this app if it was not free it would be a big waste of money or coins don't get the app if you have kindlefire.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Good visuals, good story, good princess, but the reason we are all hear, is the songs!  One of the modern Disney classics and it looks beautiful on blu-ray with a decent 3D rendering.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I love the app but when it comes to finding a mate that sucks because I'm only 10 and there are animals that I can not get them a mate because they need 150 or 400 acorns and the highest I can get is 50 . I think the creator should get that fixed.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|An interesting movie, but not a home run.  Anthony Hopkins does a better job by far of playing Hitchcock than any other actor that has tried and the story is told well.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno because it's a game 10 players can play. Sure it's a long game to finish but it's a fun game.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|An excellent film beautifully rendered.  A wonderful animated ode to Paris and fine dining.  Excellent characters, and an engaging story.
B004G8QHKO|2.0|I buy this one because of reviews and their hit &#34;Young Blood&#34;. Im a music lover and i write my own blog for a popular magazine here in Colombia, i normally review music.<br /><br />This disc isn't what i expected, just like 3 songs with some content and musicality
