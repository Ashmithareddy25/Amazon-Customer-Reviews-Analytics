0385608136|5|I'd heard wonderful things about this novel, including the sale of world rights and film rights, so was prepared for a good read, but even so it took me by surprise -- Q&A is a poignant, funny, rich, beautifully written novel with an utterly original and brilliant structure at its heart.   A rare joy.
B00005NZBN|5|An incredible CD that alternately alerts me then makes me pine for yesterday. The music in some songs drives to the core. Although you can clearly hear every word, would like to have had lyrics included.
B002WJI66C|5|Bought it for my son, a little smaller than I would have thought, the tongue stretches out pretty far, but you can also easily fold it and stick it in the mouth to make it look like a smaller tongue.  Appears to be excellent quality of plush (thicker than some other Super Mario Plushes).  Most of all my super mario-crazy son loves it, and that's all that matters.
B00IS87HYI|5|Love the game
B002RI9ZQ8|4|It was a good read, its a page turner. I love how this girl is so sharp and the way she uses technology and everything
B00PSID6ZK|1|Gets pretty tedious
B00079FUI6|5|This TV series is so funny! So entertaining! So serious. So dramatic. I bet you'll find that you know someone that's just like one of the characters in this show.
B000GBEWHA|5|If you played Grease against High School Music there would be no contest.  Danny Zucko and the gang got it beat over HSM.  This has always been a favorite of mine.  Great movie.
B008XBCJ34|5|Wow!  This works so well on my 3d TV!  I lost my 2d copy of Avatar and when I saw this on Amazon Prime for less than $20 in 3D, I couldn't resist.  The 3D effect is absolutely stunning!  Can't wait for Avatar 2 to hit the market!
B001GCUO5M|5|Left me in suspense. I love Leonardo Dicaprrio, he is such a brilliant actor, and his movies are very good!
B000QRIGLC|5|By far the best book I have read, in a long time. The boys of that ill fated seal team, deserve the warm respect and gratitude, from a beyond gracious nation.<br /><br />I wanted to read the book, prior to seeing the famous movie. I am so glad. I was right there with them, as he was telling the story that took place in the Hindu Kush. I felt the pain, and sweat and blood. Maybe not physically, but more so emotionally.<br /><br />God Bless these HEROES.
B00CWY76CC|5|Enjoyed it. Looking forward to new rooms!

0316789720|2|Had higher expectation after getting the Funprint Drawing Book by Ed Emberley. It is kinda boring and obvious how to draw a lot of the objects.  It did have some unique objects and people you wouldn't typically see to draw which could come in handy.
068987474X|5|With all due respect to the authors, here are the positive and negatives:<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />The title says it all - sometimes we try to force men into what we wish they felt.  You can't force someone to like you or find you attractive.  Too many women waste years of their lives waiting for a spark from a guy that never comes.  When a guy really likes you, there is no question about it - no mistaking it - he lets you know in no uncertain terms.  To settle for anything less degrades a woman's confidence in herself.  Most women need more confidence, not less.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that most guys let a woman know this loud and clear - that he isn't really \\"that interested.\\" But sometimes we only hear what we wish were true - or hope will be true in the future.<br /><br />Time is precious - don't waste it on a guy who really is \\"just not that into you.\\"<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />While I completely agree with the concept of the book, I can't recommend this book personally because it states that if a man is not sleeping with you, then he is not interested in you. This does a disservice to the many people who believe in waiting for marriage or who don't believe in jumping in the sack with someone they have not known a long time.<br /><br />Assumptions that sex is expected with every dating relationship can have a huge influence on young readers who WILL read this book and be permanently influenced by it.<br /><br />I also read in the book that by the time you are a few weeks or months into a relationship, you should be discussing whether or not to have #### sex. Perhaps they meant this as humorous in part, but only in part. This comment in the book was graceless at best, and believe me, it's not what you want your teen daughter taking home.  Take a look and see for yourself. You'll be more than stunned.<br /><br />So many times I have learned that you can't judge a book by its title. You have to read it before you assume that it's as great as it seems on the surface.
0061928356|5|This was such a good book  that I read I wanted to give a copy to my best friend. She enjoyed it too.  Best always, Sandra
B00E9ZATJO|4|****1/2<br /><br />Monsters University is where creatures go when they want to be instructed on the fine art of scaring the bejesus out of unsuspecting tykes lying all snug in their beds at night. Yet, while many aspire to such a career, few are called. And no one wants to learn to be a first-class scarer more than little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a short, green, one-eyed, retainer-wearing, utterly nondescript blob-with-limbs who frankly couldn't scare a bed sheet on Halloween. And it doesn't help that his greatest competition in the school's annual scare-off is a hulking furry brute by the name of  Sulley (John Goodman) who comes from a long line of scarers. But in the great opposites-attract tradition, Mike and Sulley soon learn that they can achieve more by working together than working apart. This is particularly the case after they join a fraternity made up of other wanna-be scarers who are determined to win the contest against a half-a-dozen other teams of more reliably frightening monsters.<br /><br />\\"Monsters University\\" may not be as emotionally resonant or cerebral as some previous PIXAR productions, but this prequel to the 2001 mega-hit \\"Monsters, Inc.,\\" is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever to come out of that studio - and that is saying a great deal indeed. It has terrific fun parodying the rituals of college life - fraternities, cliques, the high-pressured stress of exams - yet still manages to relate to the younger set's concerns with the need to be accepted by the \\"in\\" crowd while at the same time finding the inner strength to remain an individual and to stand up for oneself and all the other misfits in society (think of this as a monster-sized riff on \\"Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer\\").<br /><br />As this is a PIXAR release, it's practically superfluous to praise the wit and ingenuity of the script (by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and director Dan Scanlon), the beauty of the animation with its gorgeous collegiate-gothic backgrounds, and the spot-on voiceover work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output. The all-star cast includes, in addition to Crystal and Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Sean Hayes, Helen Mirren, Aubrey Plaza, John Kraskinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />So sit back, relax and enjoy the delicious treat that is \\"Monsters University.\\" But don't forget to pull the covers up at night.and the spot-on voiceover work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output.

B004S5FW1U|4|Really enjoyed it. Grown ups version of Catcher in the Rye.<br />Funny and quirky.<br />Movie was good too though as always book was better
B0015DYIH2|5|I was put off reading this series because of the vampire theme due to the bloody nature of most vampire movies/books. This series however is a love story between a human teenager and a forever 17 year old vampire. These books are more interesting than the movies since movies depend on sight and books depend on descriptive detail to set the scene. Plus screen writers use parts of the action out of sequence and sometimes scenes not included when compared to the books. Would I recommend the books, certainly. The first book, Twlight, was simplisticly written for a younger reader and almost put me off reading the rest of the series. Don't let this happen. Go on reading, the books are better written as the story unfolds.  This last book is WOW.
B00005JLKB|5|i had a little problem when the set arrived.2 discs out of 6 didn't play well. in 2 days i had a replacement set.thats service!!!plays great .
B00QROI70S|4|The movie was hilarious!
B000002UAU|3|Although somewhat disappointed that a few of the original songs seem to be recorded differently than on the original album, the clarity of the music and lyrics are as clear and fun as ever.  I keep it in my car permanently and listen to it whenever I need to \\"let loose\\"!
B006MW3V6U|1|I love the show, but am very unhappy that I can no longer watch on my android tablet.  I guess I will have to go to netflix.  What's next?  Is amazon going to take away my android kindle app?<br />MG
B007J4T2G8|2|After hearing all the flap over this novel, I decided to read it.<br />It is embarrassingly juvenile.  If all you want from a book is to be sexually stimulated, it may fulfill your needs.  If you want a book with intelligence and suspense, this isn't it.
B0001AVZA8|2|That's it.  No more.  After this, I refuse to watch another movie based on the absolutely ludicrous proposition that Jack Nicholson is sexy or even charming.  In this one, he is, at best, a leering repulsive old roue and no amount of cute dialogue can obscure it.<br />At one point, the actress playing Keaton's twenty-something daughter gushes about how attracted she was by Nicholson's personality.  That scene underlines the utter dishonesty of this movie because it is obvious to any discerning female that all he has to offer is money and clout.  I wondered how the mother in this movie would have reacted to the notion that her daughter was doing a little quid pro quo with a powerful old guy in order to upgrade her wardrobe or whatever.  It might have made things more interesting and believable.  But, unfortunately, we are supposed to like the characters in this movie.    <br />Without Nicholson it might have worked.  As it was, the intimate scenes between him and both actresses playing mother and daughter were redolent with all sorts of unpleasant and yucky speculations.  <br />I've read that some women used to find Nicholson attractive.  I believe it.  I don't understand it, but I believe it.  I just don't believe that any self respecting woman of any age would still do so.  (As for any woman choosing him over Keneau Reeves, I think others here have already expressed the appropriate amount of incredulity.)<br />Hollywood honchos must identify with the Nicholson brand of crass powerful-old-guy horniness.  (He is their fantasy of themselves still suavely pulling the chicks despite the fact that he and they retain not a shred of personal attractiveness.)  That must be why he still gets these leading man parts.  Well, it must stop.  <br />There are mature actors out there who can play believable leading men if the script calls for autumnal romance; that elegant collection of still beautiful bones, Paul Newman, for one, Warren Beatty for another (just imagine Beatty andKeaton together).  And then there is James Garner, no longer beautiful but still sexy as hell with his laid back charm.   <br />So, Hollywood, hear my plea, no more shots of Jack Nicholson's aging dimpled butt.  Please.  I would like to think that there is a limit to how low western civilization can sink.<br />One more thing, why do protagonists in movies like this have to be world famous?  When did that start?  Keaton's a world famous playwright.   Nicholson's a world famous producer.  Jeeze Marie!  <br />Tell you what, skip this movie and watch one with the same theme where the protagonists are a skirt-chasing middle-aged dentist and his dowdy receptionist.  I am speaking of the wonderful \\"Cactus Flower\\" with Walter Matthau, Ingrid Bergman, and...sigh...Goldie Hawn in her first magical incarnation.  <br />Take my advice.  It will make you so happy.

B001ESYAJY|4|While the latest Bond film was full of promise but disappointing in the end, one of the aspects of the film that wasn't was David Arnold's score. In fact Arnold follows up his excellent score to Casino Royale with a score that, while not as original as Casino's, is up to the task. The result is an enjoyable score and an enjoyable album.<br /><br />After creating one of the most original scores of the series in Casino Royale, Arnold adheres a little more closely to the traditional Bond score for the film and this album. After making the James Bond Theme non-existent in Casino Royale, Arnold allows it to slip in without it being intrusive. In fact Arnold with one moment in particular perfectly captures the feel of the earlier John Barry scores with the scene of Bond and Fields (Field Trip on this album). While most of the album is terrific, unfortunately the main title theme Another Way To Die is amongst the series worst with some odd lyrics and an odd performance (the duet was a good idea if only the song had been better).<br /><br />Arnold uses Quantum of Solace to show off his ability to make a good Bond score. While it might not be up there with the scores to Casino Royale or On Her Majesty's Secret Service, there is plenty to like about the score to Quantum of Solace is a fine piece of film. Unlike the film, it isn't disappointing in the end.
B00BD99JMW|5|This books was one of my favorite of all three books, yes the ending was a little hard to take, but what do you expect a cheesy ending made to make the reader happy and feeling it had to have a Cinderella ending. This was fantasy, but the reality of it is - and I don't want to spool the ending for anyone but Caleb was week and a coward. I really could not see him pulling off what needed to be done.  Actually I could not see anyone with the determination and skill set and mind set of pulling thru with mission that needed to happen, besides Tris or Tobias. To make it happen with any other person would have been more un-believable.  I would have like to have seen more of Tris and Tobias and have a happy ever after ending for them, but the world they lived in was not happy and it would take many generations to change that, so we would not see the truly happy ending, but the legacy that was made for Tris and the Thoughts and believes that were relayed were dead on.  I loved the ending and even cried some tears for Tobias and way to go Christine who really shown thru as a true friend. This is the life and legacy I would only wish would I could leave.<br /><br />I loved the authors message in all three books.
B00DR0PDNE|4|google chrome, what else can I say
B00IK67OQO|4|Good
B009UWYFFK|4|My daughter is 10. This movie is right up her alley. It has wit, charm, and quite a bit of predictability and a few eye-rolling moments for the adults, but you can definitely tell this movie was aimed at the younger crowd. The voice actors were well chosen and the animation was well done.
B007THA4FI|1|I was very disappointed with JK Rowlings new book.  I was excited to buy it but after just a few pages, I realized that I could not read this book.  It is full of very vulgar and offensive language.  I actually returned it to Amazon for a refund.
B00HETFP2S|5|been a who fan since the 70's.  seen all the new ones many times.<br />so yes, it was good.
B00AFQC4QC|5|Enjoyed learning about our history as told thru the eyes of several different religions and views.  A new perspective of what happened not so many years ago.
B001ANSSDC|5|It is a wacky story, but the truth comes thrugh about how we all can grow and change. It has a lot of family dynamics that are common for us all, as well. It's funny and heartwarming.  It gives you a good feeling about embracing the ever changing journey of life and your heart.
6305878323|5|Can Never go wrong with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. I loved this movie when I was a teen. Now I enjoy it even more with my grandchildren.
B009KS4XRO|5|The app is free but I can't continue to play if it tells me I'm out of credits every hour and need to buy more.  That's not free.

B00008BXJJ|5|This was the first AC/DC album i brought and if you dont like this album ,get your head checked!<br />This is the ultimate AC/DC live album. Usually your bad reviews come from those fans that wont accept Brian took over from Bon and dont like Brian for it. Or they say it lacks the feel of a live show because a few songs fade out (its only crowed noise)<br />This is the best Live album ive ever heard! not a single song on here that dosent sound great! Make sure you get the 2 disc edition and not the one disc! Its not quite the greatest hits played live, but everyone of them is a great hit! <br />This is a great album , and if you dont have it, BUY IT (...)<br />A commen question that comes up about this album is \\"is the single disc edition, and the double disc edition diffrent tracks? or are they they same? The anser is; There the same! The double edition just comes with more songs, but there all the same songs as the single edition! Theres a rumour that Highway To Hell is diffrent, but its not!<br />My only problem with this re-issue is that they didnt include a track that came with the Japanese edition of this album \\"Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be\\" but its still the best live album out there next to to \\"If you want blood\\"
B0006399FS|4|Though the music is entertaining (see other 1300+ reviews) I am disappointed in that the disc did not contain instructions for dismantling an atomic device. That kept me from rating it 5 stars. I apologize that this is a brief review, but I have the pressing issue of an atomic bomb ticking away in my basement and need to act fast. In retrospect I should not have paid for expedited shipping.
B0052UZIFA|5|Has me up at 1 in the morning playing it. Consider yourself warned! What else do I need to say?
0765350386|1|I couldn't get through the first chapter. A BIG disappointment!!!! The story was trite and the magic was forced and gimmicky!
B0018CWESK|5|Great movie! Both discs played without a problem and the extra features were great! This is a must buy for any fans.
B000002KHY|5|This CD includes all the songs JT is best known for from the 70's.  The songs are expertly performed as only the singer/songwriter (of most the songs! ) could do.  This CD will most certainly transport the listener back  to a simpler time.  Just hearing the start of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;  still gives me chills.
B0007GAERG|5|\\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" exceeded ALL of my expectations. I never would have figured that she could have come back so strong. Her voice is just as magical as it was before. It's comforting to know that Mariah still has what it takes to be the vocal diva that she was in the 90's. When I first heard \\"It's Like That\\" I knew Mariah was back in true form. Then she has blown me away even more with the stunning and dynamic \\"We Belong Together.\\" But this isn't where it ends. It's just the beginning. She goes on to close the album with the breathtaking Gospel \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\" Mariah has reinvented herself for the better and it sounds like she had a great time doing it.
B009NFHF0Q|4|This is a nice read, but feels like a short story. The characters are well developed, the story is interesting with plenty of surprises, and like all his other books its a little quirky. I really enjoyed it, but I cold have used a couple of hundred more pages.  When I finished I wanted more.
B008CP6RWU|5|Just had my best play through with another white robe - it was perfection. Our ending together brought tears to my eyes. Zanarkhan, if you happen to read this - thank you. &#60;3<br /><br />Thank you to all the companions I've met and shared this incredible experience with.
B000W9399S|3|So this was my first Pratchett novel.  Although he is a gifted writer, I don't see what the hubbub is all about.  The irreverence and nonsensical nature of the plot is just not suited for my taste. Might have to read one more just to be sure...
1616550414|5|perfect with no bent corners.
B007IXWKUK|3|More of the same....starting to get a little closer to the reason behind Mr. Grey's sexual appetite.  I think I get an A+ for finishing this series.
B000ALZHUC|5|good cd and cme in the mail on time. this is a good cd for people who like thrah metal.
B00003CXD5|5|Quite simply the best performance of a true legend. I am stunned that this is not out on DVD. Rated in the Top 100 by the AFI, this classic is way overdue for recognition.
B00GEEB9YC|5|I never thought I would find myself laughing out loud on a book about the science and philosophy of consciousness, but here I am, having to pause to collect myself before I keep reading, because of the bolts of humor that are woven into this masterful tapestry of intellectual inquiry.  It is not that this book is one belly laugh after another, but Mr. Harris often finds the humor in self-discovery and is extremely efficient at shining a light on it in the midst of an otherwise serious probing on the subject of the self.  It is as about as smart as a book can be on this topic without meandering into tedium.    I am also glad Mr Harris did not take the advice of the Buddhist fable he references about the man with an arrow in his chest and the penchant people have over-thinking a situation in which the remedy requires action and not more tangential detail.  I am very happy he went into the detail here because it was absolutely fascinating and I am better for it.  He has processed a massive amount of science and blended it with the relatively insoluble notion of consciousness and produced something that is not only meaningful but thrilling in its own way to read. He is very adept at balancing the transfer of information and insight while maintaining interest.  Basically, he never lost me because I was too excited to read what came next.
B00881VLCE|4|fun! just wish we had more of a variety to choose from&hellip;or fhe option to upload pics from our gallery.

B004ZRV3AU|3|You need skilled hands for this one. When done right, it'll score the bottle. It was a hassle overall.
B00005JKJA|5|This movie was exellent.  I warn viewers though, only watch this if you're in the mood to think, because you'll be doing plenty of that by the time the movie is over.<br />At first I doubted this movie, but after a while it occurred to me that if David Lynch (writer and director), even though I have no idea who he is, put his name on the cover, then he must be proud of something in the movie.  And, being as I work at a video store and get to watch videos for free, I watched it.<br />The movie does a very good job at avoiding stereotypical scenes (i.e. cat jumps up and scares someone scene or the \\"phew that was close\\" then something bad happens scene).<br />One of the outstanding aspects of this movie is the sound.  Music always matches what is going on.  Also, maybe this is a personal preference, but I love the use of dead silence to make things scarrier.  There were many wonderful moments in the movie where the only thing you can hear is the DVD player running.<br />Acting: C -=- 76 out of 100 points<BR>Story: B+ -=- 87 out of 100 points<BR>Sound: A+ -=- 100 out of 100 points<BR>(BONUS) Avoiding Stereotypical Scenes   +10 points<BR>(BONUS) Lesbianism   +10 points<BR>(BONUS) Smart-alleck Nerdy Character   +10 points<BR>-------------<BR>Overall 97.6% (293 out of 300 points)

B000AP04L0|5|NOTHING beats this movie. It has Jennifer Anniston ....do you really need any other reason to buy this movie? this movie is too funny. I love how he just stops caring (not on purpose) and does what he feels like doing whenever he wants, including treating his boss how some of us want to treat ours,

I recommend all Enigma CDs to every New Age music fan and not only.<BR>Excellent and wonderful music and even if it is not 100% what I would like it to sound, but it is one of the best so far on the market.

B00IJJUIMY|4|It's always such a treat to see a new Michael Connelly book out - and reason for me to sit down and enjoy reading right away!  The Burning Room didn't disappoint - and of course neither did Harry Bosch. Several reviews mentioned, and I agree - this book has less of Harry's angst due to trying to find a romantic relationship for himself, and less concern over parenting issues with his teen-aged daughter. This time we're seeing Harry as he partners with a new young hotshot in the &#34;Open Unsolved Unit&#34;; I liked reading Harry's thoughts and words as he tries to find the right balance between being too hands-on and giving his junior partner some rope.  The plot was just fine - twists and turns all fit.  What I'd so love is for Harry to stop telling us about what ROUTE he takes through the horrible Los Angeles traffic - another reviewer commented on this.  I will never understand LA - maybe this is great reading for those readers who know the area - or enjoy the area?? If he'd stop with that, he'd be PERFECT.  I find it fascinating to read about how new technologies make it possible to solve cases once unsolvable.  As Harry nears retirement - I wonder  - is this the last Harry Bosch book - I hope NOT!!!!
1435122968|5|I received \\"H.P. Lovecraft: The Complete Fiction\\" as a gift from my son; it is truly one of those gifts that keeps on giving.<br /><br />My previous exposure to Lovecraft was limited to a short story here or there in a horror anthology, so obviously I am not a hardcore Lovecraft (or horror fiction) aficianado. Whether or not this is truly the 'complete' fiction of Lovecraft (this seems to be a matter of disagreement by fans) I am likewise in no position to judge. However there are some truly stellar aspects of this collection that I would like to share.<br /><br />The brief introduction at the beginning of each piece by editor S.T. Joshi was a nice addition. Generally a short paragraph giving a bit of background on the piece, it helps place the work in the continuum of Lovecraft's writing career. I did not feel that they contained any major 'spoilers', but rather discussions of stylistic forms, date of first publication, and notes of interest such as rejection by a certain publisher. As a novice Lovecraft reader I found them helpful.<br /><br />The book takes you more or less chronologically through Lovecraft's work, rather than grouping the stories by style or subject. I enjoyed being able to see how the author evolved over the course of his apprenticeship into the craftsman he was to become.  You can see how other authors influenced him, and how he truly learned by doing, integrating ideas from his previous works into what became the Cthulu mythos.<br /><br />This is a heavy book, in subject as well as mass, so it's not one to read nonstop in the course of a few days. This has held the place of honor on my nightstand for months, to be tasted in discreet and enjoyable morsels, mulled over and digested, then tasted again. It has certainly brought some interesting color to my dreams.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended!

B00BRUQ7ZY|5|Despite all the notoriety of the interview of the author by a Fox News interviewer, Reza Aslan may be a Muslim but he is openly fascinated with Jesus and his historical times.  He is a religious professor who has the research background to bring to life the times of Palestine under Roman rule and what was common or uncommon with the native peoples.  He does not reflect an anti-Christian bias nor an anti-Jewish bias but a determination to bring to life the times of Jesus and who he may have been or why he was considered a threat.  I'm sure those who believe that the Bible is 100% accurate and totally the word of God will not be happy but history is factual rather than spiritual.
B005IQZB14|5|Such an amazing book and it kept me engaged the whole time. I couldn't stop reading. It was very inspirational and I would highly recommend it. I can't wait to see the movie that comes out next month!
B00BD99JMW|3|These are good books.  Divergent got me into the groove and I thought Insurgent was the better of the two, so I was a little disappointed with Allegiant.  All in all, these were all a good read but not as good as the Hunger Games trilogy.

B005CRQ2XA|5|I purchased this book for my grandson and he loved it.  He has read every Diary of a Wimpy Kid book and always looks forward to the new ones when they come out.

B00138F4OK|4|thought this would help me more then it really didi the music is uplifting and the tracks are  ones that would sweep you into workout madness if you left them. Some of the music is really moving emotionally and I guess that is why the rocky films were so big
B005DF2QMC|2|I returned the item because it put out a mono, not a stereo signal, so was useless for converting my stereo cassette tapes. This was a hardware, not a software problem. I don't know whether all the units are mono only, or whether this was a problem just with my unit. As others have said, the hardware is rather flimsy, but it was the mono only that was the deal breaker for me.
B0087EVHTE|5|I've been using computers for nearly 30 years and have built about 100. I'm sorry guys, I mean, I don't think I'm a big shot, but I've never purchased an i5 before, until recently I've always used the top or close to it, Intel processor, Xeon's or i7's these days. But a few weeks back I assembled an i3 NUC and for normal computer work it's just fine. The other two computers I'm on a lot are an upgraded Dell i7 4770 and a custom built dual Xeon workstation.<br /><br />I do a lot of computer upgrades so I'm looking at new power supplies and RAM and video cards from upgrades all around my garage and none of it being used. So I figure if I've got to store them somewhere....So inspired by the NUC I get a Rosewill mini tower and a card reader with USB 3 ports, an Asus board, an Intel SSD and some accessories. Digging through my leftovers I found 16 GB of 1600 MHz ram and a 460 watt p/s and a GTX 650 card and with the i5 I've got a system worthy of today's standards.<br /><br />It's no surprise that this little system is capable, after using the i3 NUC. After 25 years of building and lot's of hot rodding I think overclocking is in my past. Drives were always the problem and SSD's are the fix, so building a new 18 month old computer is a fine way to store old parts and with USB 3 externals I don't even need a second drive, although I should put one in, it is storage after all, I'll put in two. This processor will do some serious work quickly, unlike the i3, I can hardly notice the difference from the i7 4770. Researching the matter, the performance of this 3.4 GHz i5 didn't change much from the 2nd, 3rd to 4th generation, the new Haswell isn't 10% faster. With Windows power options set to High Performance it runs at 3.6 and boosts to almost 3.9GHz. But what's important is that the processor is only one of many things that make a computer fast and your information can't be processed any faster than your drive can read or write it and more RAM won't help if your program doesn't use it and accesses the drive, so use a SSD. With the stock cooler I've yet to see over 38 degrees, so try it before spending money on an upgrade.<br /><br />This system isn't as small as the NUC (what is?)  but it's small and I've kept it quiet by turning down the speed of its 2 case fans and it's another hard working machine for $550. Those considering Shuttle's for HTPC or mini servers should take a look. So what was I missing? At least $150 on every other processor I purchased.'t use it and accesses the drive, so use a SSD.

0451196716|3|The Long Walk is a good Stephen King novel.  It is not as polished refined or focused as other efforts, but as with almost all of his work it is spirited reading.  The work introduces us to the parallel King universe of Richard Bachman, where it is indicated that the view is more dark and cynical.<br /> As many of Stephen King's novels, the novel itself is an examination of the human experience as depicted and revealed through exceptional circumstances.  Although not as poetic, I liken the Long Walk to Cool Hand Luke.  Both the book and the movie concentrate on flawed savior figures, in which we can easily identify ourselves, placed in constrained circumstances.<br /> The Long Walk centers around Ray Garrity who has elected to participate in the Long Walk, which is an endurance walking contest for young men.  In this surreal parallel universe, the familiar geography of our United States is controlled by an unnamed marshal force.  The controlling government challenges the fortitude of its young men, suggesting participation in a suicide contest.  The rules are simple: the boys must continue walking at a pace of 4.0 mph or better.  If a contestant fails, after three (3) warnings, to maintain this speed; he is shot and killed on the spot.  There is only one winner, the last boy walking, and to him goes the satisfaction of any wish and whim he desires.  <br /> While the horror or imminent and random death is the backdrop for the story, the substance lies in the examination of the individual participants and their individual reasons for participating.  Garrity commiserates with those in his like lot. Engaging in discussions about the meanings of their lives, the boys examine their individual reasons for their participation, and form personal alliances for survival which seemingly go against the individual's chance for ultimate success.  The main character, Garrity, is forced to examine himself and the reason for his participation.  The circumstances are complicated whena stoic participant turns out to be the Major's (the symbol of Marshal law and host of the contest) son.  Garrity is required to contemplate whether the ultimate reward is worthy of his participation.<br />In many senses, the Long Walk is an extended and perhaps stretched allegory of life itself.  The vagaries of life and death and the people and acquaintances we meet along the way.  The Long Walk is definitely an enjoyable book that is filled with the texture that King lovers have come to appreciate.  However, it is not as broad, accomplished or refined as other works, such as It, The Shining, The Body or Shawshank Redemption; or as horrifically well executed as Pet Sematary or Salem's Lot.
6302256615|5|&quot;Little Hand Says it's time to rock and roll&quot; just one of the quotes from this movie that make it a non stop action with a very good plot and everything an action bank robbery movie could need. could have used a  little better work on the ending and i would have made it ALOT longer but i  guess it's an action movie so it can't be that long... to some this movie  up it is a non stop action thiller with great robbery scenes and a very  weird ending
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book tells you a realistic life journey of two teenagers that find love within they're problematic lives. I love this book because it creates a new perspective on life and makes you grateful everyday. Enjoy reading this book and be prepared to laugh, cry, smile and well- love it.
0517543052|5|In the 70s I remember sitting on my living room floor sharing with my roommates the very colorful Remember, Be Here Now. We were all reading it together. I was puzzled and so were they. We had no context to understand the simplicity of the spirit of the book. It was only as I experienced life and got older that I understood the joy of being in the moment -- of being conscious of real communication and compassion. I would like to think that that was the beginning of my personal path toward becoming a more aware human being and a family therapist.  Although the book is from a very different era the messages and philosophies that Ram Dass brought to western society - after his long studies in India - are now so widely accepted and prevalent that they are now even quoted on Oprah!<br /><br />Recently I had the privilege and pleasure to travel to Haiwaii and meet Ram Dass in person and it made me realize that this book is perhaps more relevant today than it when it was written (or maybe that's just wisdom through age!).
B00005B36H|5|I may sound inconsiderate for saying something negative about this incredible album after a wait of five years, but it does indeed fall the slightest bit short of Aenima. I have composed a list of improvements and bad points as compared to Aenima.<br />Improvements:<BR>Aenima may have more good songs, but Lateralus's good songs are better.<BR>The lyrics are much more thoughtful, with a lot less vulgarity (the only swear is in Ticks and Leeches)<BR>The range of Maynard's vocals is more thoroughly expressed. He can do everything you're used to and then some (screaming for instance)<BR>The good songs are longer and provide more action and flat-out greatness. <br />Unprovements (bad points as compared to Aenima):<BR>Less good songs<BR>Many of the tracks aren't even songs, just a series of noises or eerie rift.<BR>These songs are more for a seroius mood (not that its a bad thing) but some of Aenima's songs may better fit a fun mood. (Hooker with a Penis, for example)<br />This album is anything but bad, in fact its one of my favorite albums of all time. But if you are finally deciding to dig into the best band of all time, i suggest you pick up Aenima first because its the best album of all-time.
B000001GQB|5|Karl Bohm was truly a master interpreter of Mozart, and he had the best orchestra in Europe to complement his interpretive talents.  The 40th and the 41st &quot;Jupiter&quot; are easily the best recordings available, but  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of power in the 38th,  &quot;Prague&quot; (I prefer Leonard Bernstein's recording with the Vienna  Philharmonic for the 38th).  In general, I think Bohm's penchant for  playing Mozart symphonies at a slightly faster tempo than most conductors  is highly successful, and it is especially evident in the recording of the  40th.  First rate work.
B0050PYNO4|5|This movie has to be watched several times its so good. If you are a Star Wars and Star Trek fan there are lots of lines and scenes cleverly in there to find. Its funny!
B003OWVHVC|3|got a chance recently to listen to his album all the way through and it had some cool moments. vocally he reminds of Anthony Hamilton from the Bill Withers school of Harmony and tone. Miss fortune is a cool cut and I need a Dollar is very direct and on time.  dug the arrangements and Production here.  this is a cool album and versatile.
076781214X|4|peggy sue is a great movie it came right away and was brand new just like it said I didn't pay that much for it either which it the great thing about it
0385338724|3|This is a very light, fun book that does not require a lot of thought or analyzing.  It won't change your life or make you look at things differently.  But sometimes that is what you need!  It's a very quick and entertaining read that makes you laugh out loud.  Sometimes I think because the plot is so airy and light one overlooks the quality of the writing.  The writing is actually quite good-the author manages to keep your interest and speeds the story right along.  Recommended as a good beach or airplane read, or when you just need to relax and forget about life for a couple of hours.
B00G5G7K7O|5|It's a great movie for the whole family. It had great animation, with a good plot and development with all the makings of a good story.
B00CCMKPO0|5|top rated DVD at it best, love the story and the lessons learned and the love and respect he had for Both men
B005544V6A|5|I really enjoyed that first season a lot<br />Characters are great, diverse, human, with humor<br />Really worth it.... As well as the following seasons
B001JNNE64|5|Complete set of everything needed to fully enjoy the movie. Neat and compact, the set takes little space but gives much enjoyment.
B00000I1OY|2|Ah, the Sixties... America's longtime history of art intertwining with psychedelia starts here. Listening to the musical artists of the time -- Laura Nyro, Joe Cocker, old Heart records -- one wonders if the rampant search for inner meaning in an increasingly meaningless society ever made it's way to the silver screen. Well, wonder no more, gentle movieviewer! The Swimmer is proof positive that directors, too, were coked to the gills. Set amidst a disgustingly suburban upper-middle class vista, Burt Lancaster (a man who's entire physique immediately brings the name \\"Stretch Armstrong\\" to mind) decides to mark his return home by 'swimming' across town. No, it's not Venice; he accomplishes his task by taking a dip in every pool in the borough. Along the way, we discover that Lancaster has shafted pretty much everyone in the film, literally or otherwise, and the cinematography takes decidedly bizarre turns during his descent from jet-setting, womanizing capitalist to pathetic, obsessive-compulsive freak. The dialogue is downright absurd at times -- \\"What happened to the sun? There's no more warmth in it!\\" -- and the cameramen seem to be completely stoned, especially during Janet Langard's soliloquey about her childhood crush on Lancaster, spoken from behind Lancaster's head, behind foliage. As the strichnine poisoning slowly begins to take this acidtrip film down horrible paths, we're not surprised, or even moved, when a thoroughly defeated Lancaster receives what he sorely deserves: a swift boot in the rear.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Good book!  Interesting twists and turns...keeps the readers attention.  Great job building characters.  As always it is a John Grisham story...one of his best!
B000FTWB7G|4|Earlier this year, I discovered Evanescence's previous albums. One of them, Origin, I believe it wasn't released under a label, is one of my favorite albums ever. So, during the Summer, when I heard that Evanescence was coming out with a new album, I was stoked. But it turns out that the album wasn't what I expected. It's a lot more defiant rage than sweet sadness. The songs on their previous albums were haunting. Amy Lee lamenting a lost love, succumbing to darkness and then being reborn again... it's a lot more heartbreaking than what she's wrote here. I admit, I miss Ben Moody's writing, though they tend to be quite suicidal at times. Despite this, though, The Open Door is a fun ride. I guess it is enjoyable to see Amy Lee overcome her trials.  <br /> <br />I guess what she's trying to tell us in this album is, I used to be sad and suicidal but here I am alive and kicking. As she sings in, \\"Weight of the World\\"- \\"I won't be held down by who I used to be.\\" <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Evanescence, you should buy it, for Amy Lee's voice alone. But if you're just getting into the band, I suggest that you start with Fallen or Origin. This album is a lot more experimental than the other two. <br /> <br />The best two songs on this album, in my opinion, are \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Lithium.\\" The rest are pretty good, but it all starts to get pretty repetitive. <br /> <br />And on a side note... I know that a lot of people dislike \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" but I've actually begun to like it. It has to grow on you, people. Give it time.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Very satisfied.
B00E8B1358|2|Very weak story if you even want to call it that.  The acting was very weak as well.  The kids enjoyed it, but that's not you expect from this movie.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I love this game so much that I have this game on every device that I own<br />Greatest game ever

B0081L391C|4|Convenient download, decent price
B009AMAJVO|4|Great movie with some wonderful twists. You get action, emotional involvement, complete character development. All of this with an excellent storyline. Cue it up and crank the volume, Farrell's brogue can be a low growl and difficult to understand at times.
B00BVYNSLC|5|One of the best written, best acted, and best produced shows on television in any genre. A must-see!
B000050FEN|2|After checking out a myriad of &quot;must haves&quot; in DVD, I bought the recommended, and after having enjoyed the theatrical release, and credits, watched terrible dialogue and sloppy moments throughout.  After the terrific credits the film is just flim-flam despite photography and actors.  Just style !!!...a remake of regurgitated ideas from &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; /the detective side.  Stick with &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; on any night.  Loved the credits!!!<br />Considering it was in New York, when can you simply travel to the desert in 1/2 hour..........? Or give a dinner party, and then explain to the guest AFTER dinner that your apartment is over a subway?
B00LXLM05I|5|This game is cool I like it and you might like it to. No problems in this app so far my favorite character is the warrior
B000929AJQ|4|Trent Reznor is back, with a new drug-free lifestyle, a fresh outlook on life, and one pissed off record which gives no indication of the first two points. With Teeth is the latest NIN outing since The Fragile's two disc epic release, and ultimately a tighter album in overall structure from The Downward Spiral and The Fragile, both records which interspersed tracks of pure static, electric insanity among the more structured songs. Not so with Reznor's latest audio monster, upon which almost every song is presented in catchy, pop-like structures which almost defy the angst-ridden lyrics and abrasive music which is contained in them. With Teeth is a record meant to present the mentality of being unsure of oneself, and the lyrics do the usual depression-laden justice so such a gloomy theme, almost all of the songs using the experience of love gone wrong to lead us through Trent's tormented and angry mind. The cohesiveness of the record harkens us NIN fans back to the days of Pretty Hate Machine's pop qualities, being not nearly as sprawling or ambitious as The Fragile, and the change, in my opinion, is a positive one. <br /> <br />The most notable difference between this one and other Reznor releases is that NIN now sounds more like a live band than a one-man synthesizer assault, Dave Grohl's unique drum style contributing highly to dragging Reznor away from his drum machines and keyboards, although the electronic ambience can still be found lurking in the background of every track. It now seems that the sonic keyboard effects which made Reznor famous have taken a backseat to an acoustic piano, and the playing presents Reznor's classical piano playing in a form that is rarely exposed through his music, the instruments light, soothing touch providing a small sense of comfort and a contradictory sense of beauty behind the madness. <br /> <br />Don't worry though, if one thing is true it's that NIN definitely isn't going soft. Aside from the tear-jerking album closer of Right Where It Belongs, which immediately brings to mind images of Hurt, every track on With Teeth drives forward with the fury of a man possessed, You Know What You Are? and Only tearing out of the speakers with a metal fury which is unparralleled. Trent might be 40 years old now, but he certainly doesn't show any signs of aging. Those worried that the Pretty Hate Machine-esque synth rock is gone from the classic NIN sound will also find comfort in The Hand That Feeds and Beside You In Time. To sum it all up, everyone complaining about how much this record sucks and how Trent has sold out really needs to grow up. Though it is somewhat of a departure from the bands former sound, With Teeth still stays close enough to Reznor's classic touch to be comfortable for any fan, and though the whole album might take a few listens to appreciate as a whole, anyone saying that the songs aren't damn catchy is only lying to themself.
B00JJXTP64|4|No spoilers in this review.<br /><br />Lots of fun to read. Doesn't really progress the \\"war\\" plot much, but instead covers the healing and clean up after the big battle in the last book.<br /><br />Which brings up an issue, if you haven't read the earlier books in the series, you will be completely lost at some of the character and plot references in this book.<br /><br />As always, impatiently waiting for the next installment.
B00ABKGG0C|5|I liked Ryan's style of writing, great details, and amazing character building focus. The story was well written and  plot was nicely revealed.
B001ANSS5K|4|A wonderful, lyrical read. This is the third John Green book I've read and he seems to tie together very universal themes of friendship, the need to belong and the need to be independent; shallowness and depth that coexist all around us, often in the same place or person; our friends that get us and the parts of us they never touch; how we are both windows and mirrors into ourselves and for others.<br /><br />The author's style and pace make the book an easy and enjoyable read.
B00B2JSRAS|5|Although I have read few books about the same topic, I like the way the author expresses her insight and the fact of giving the experiments makes this book unique. Enjoy it!
B00KY7PEAA|1|Cheap game.

B000000Y87|5|Anyone interested in the evolution of the jazz piano trio should purchase this album for it captures the great Bill Evans at the peak of his powers along with the late legendary bassist Scott LaFaro. Recorded in September of 1961 at the Village Vanguard, the trio's interplay is indeed telepathic but unfortunately several days later, Scott LaFaro would be tragically killed in an auto accident. Before I forget, let's not forget the contributions of drummer Paul Motian to this trio. At a time when many drummers would state the beat, Motian would imply it in his own way as Elvin Jones would in the famous Coltrane quartet. But this trio set the mode for other future trios to come since the bass also now had a voice rather than customarily maintaining a pulse. LaFaro's influence would spread to other heavyweights bassists such as Richard Davis, Gary Peacock, Eddie Gomez, Dave Holland and Miroslav Vituous, several of which who also played in Miles Davis' bands. This album along with the trios of Bud Powell on Blue Note & Verve should be added to any essential jazz lists of important trios.
B001FB4W0W|5|does any know when the season 1 of the true blood series is expected to be released on dvd?
B009JBWOU0|1|What a waste of money. Neither of the so called 'DVDs' work on anything. Not on an Xbox 360, PC or on an actual DVD player! I want a complete refund.
B000000YG5|5|Yes, what you have been reading about this album is all true. It IS that incredible. Just one note on the 2nd track  \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" - I didn't know a ballad can be played with this much attitude and even anger. You can virtually smell Sonny's sweat. The ultimate opposite of Stan Getz-style lyricism. 100 stars.
B001EYU1VO|3|Doesn't properly fit the hand of a left handed user properly but it is accurate. Not really configurable to a left handed user.
B00BD99JMW|4|Heroine has unfulfilled ending but not sure how it could have ended better.  She was such a unique character would have liked to read more of her exploits.
B003R0LBVW|4|I loved \\"The Corrections,\\" like many reviewers here, and found this one hard to read.  I could feel the writer striving to out-do himself, and it effected the overall believability of the characters.  Franzen is very gifted, but perhaps there was too much pressure on him, since \\"The Corrections\\" garnered so much praise and was embraced so deeply by his fans.  That's a lot to live up to.  Still, there was enough here to recommend.
B008Y7IUBM|5|Funny and clever
B00KWVZ750|5|I love the game it's  very fun unlike most other games very very very very very very very very very fun
B00B4VXQC8|5|I am listen to it every day, it is on right now. Every cd is better than the last one I don't think he could ever make a bad recording,<br />I love the band. Hope he comes to Philly soon
B00CL68QVQ|4|a quirky film that I would recommend to all my friends. Was surprised with how much I enjoyed. Check it out!
B00BUCXVPI|5|Awesome!!!! Loved it!!!!
B005LLSZNM|4|Outstanding action series about a \\"bike club\\", in Charming Calif.  A show that makes you cheer for the bad guys. I wouldn't let my child watch it.
B004J4WLB4|4|The idea behind this book was catchy, but the characters did not seem fully developed. Flowers have been used forever as a way to communicate, and the use of them as indicators of emotions was Victorian as well as modern. I felt the ending was rushed, characters were left hanging and threads of themes were left untied.
B006M4RN3U|5|This s a very enjoyable CD with a bit of nonordinary music. I look forward to future releaces from FUN.
B0089LOG02|4|Never know about the trains that carried young orphan children from the east to the mid west and tried to place them in homes.  Interesting and griping story.
B000KQGP2G|5|This album is experimental, as usual, and does not fail to hit the mark in every way. POS will never sit still and repeat past successes - So you must listen with an open mind and not compare to prior albums. I sense that the poor reviews are a result of folks jusy not \\"getting it\\". For example, Disco Queen is NOT a disco song - It is Daniel pushing the envelope again, and with great success. It is songs like this, as well as the others, that merit an easy 5 star rating for Scarsick.

B009XIXVU6|4|Beautiful story of family and the ties that bind.  A reminder that the world is smaller than we think.  I don't generally care for books that jump around rather than working chronologically, but in this case I don't know how else it could have been written.
B003I87O2I|5|VERY strong disc within their catalog. It's unfortunate most of the original band isn't here anymore, but Kelly Hansen does a great job stepping up to Lou Gramm's mic and delivering, and the songs themselves are catchy & memorable. Foreigner's sound is dynamic enough it's fairly pointless to answer the question, &#34;but, does it sound like Foreigner,&#34; but all the ingredients are there, including more consistently memorable songs than the last couple of discs..
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It is just like flappy bird. I like it! Actually I love it!!! I highly recommend this game to flappy bird lovers!
B000068W6E|5|This is a great re-issue of a classic Ten Years After album. It has been released to look like a vinyl sleeve record cover, only smaller to house the cd. The CD is covered in a plastic cover, just like the vinyl version. Beware though - as this album comes with only 4 bonus tracks, not 6 as this webpage advertises. But hey, who cares, they sound great. Well worth the purchase. The tracks are very good and clear.
B0044KJIIC|5|Best series of Smallville.
B00ABGEFWC|5|this is a game for any age I am 19 and I love it I just need friends that's all so
B00AEBBAEK|5|Good movie
B000000WA2|5|I just recently bought this album, the second blur album i've gotten,(Parklife is the other) and am totally impressed by i'ts cleverness, both lyrical and musical.  Any professed rock music fan who listens to this album and says that it is no good is completely off base. Every song has tags that will stick in the memory. Brilliant music. I will be checking out some more blur!
B003Y5H59W|4|I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations for the Captain America movie. They're tried to adapt it twice before and... well, it was ridiculous. And I'm not just talking about the costume.<br /><br />So it came as a pleasant surprise that this latest comic book movie is not only better than the previous adaptations of Captain America's story, but is a robust, action-packed thriller in its own right. \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" has an earnest, idealistic tone mingled sometimes poignant realism -- exactly what it needs to have.<br /><br />The time: World War II. Scrawny asthmatic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) desperately wants to defend his country, but he's too puny to enter the army. Dr. Abraham Erskine sees the goodness and courage in Steve's heart, and enlists him in a top-secret experiment to create a super-soldier. Within minutes, Steve has superhuman strength, speed and big shiny muscles. HOORAY!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the army seems more interested in using the superpowered Captain America as a mascot than a fighter. Are you really surprised? This is the GOVERNMENT we're talking about.<br /><br />When Steve learns that his best buddy has been captured by the Nazis, he singlehandedly invades an enemy base and rescues dozens of soldiers. But this brings him to the attention of the Nazi super-science division Hydra, and its malevolent leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) -- who is the only other man as strong as Captain America.<br /><br />This summer has had a lot of comic book movies -- some were horribly disappointing (\\"Green Lantern,\\" \\"Priest\\") and some were wonderful (\\"Thor\\"). I wasn't entirely sure which kind of movie \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" would be, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well-written and solidly-plotted it was.<br /><br />There's also a lot of gritty, smoky action with flying bullets (and shields), fiery explosions, and speeding trains carrying machine-gun robots. But the writers don't neglect the human side of Captain America's story, whether it's his friendship with a fellow soldier or his budding romance with an icy sharpshooter.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is the MacGuffinness of the subplot MacGuffin, which really doesn't do anything except also be an unnecessary deus ex machina. Really, was there ANY reason for the Odin cube to be in this?<br /><br />As for the cast, they're uniformly solid. Chris Evans plays Steve as earnest, sweet and loyal, but with iron-clad determination and plenty of courage, and he's backed by excellent performances by Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and a steely-nerved sharpshooting Hayley Atwell. And Hugo Weaving is AWESOME -- this guy can play a Nazi in a red latex mask, and still come across as insanely scary.<br /><br />\\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is a lot like Captain America himself -- robust, action-packed, with a good earnest heart at its core. Thoroughly enjoyable.dship with a fellow soldier or his budding romance with an icy sharpshooter.

B0060D123K|5|This is a wonderful Muppet take on Dickens' perennial classic &#34;A Christmas Carol.&#34;  It has everything you'd expect from a Muppet outing: lots of humor (some aimed over the kids' heads at moms & dads), great songs & music, lots of Muppets, and lots of heart.  It also manages to stay faithful enough to the source material to actually feel respectable.  Michael Caine makes a great Scrooge, though he plays it a bit less curmudgeonly than you normally find.  That's entirely appropriate since this is a family flick, and one of the great things about this movie is that it is suitable for all ages.  The ghost of Jacob Marley becomes the ghosts of Jacob & Robert Marley (played by Muppets Statler & Waldorf), and they are more funny than frightening along with the rest of the characters.  Despite its humor, the movie still has a sweet nostalgic streak that runs deep and it really is a great re-telling of a great story.  If you're looking to introduce the little ones to Dickens' classic story, if you like the Muppets, or if you just like great family holiday movies, this one is a winner.

B00CKJ2KK2|5|Its like team fortress 2 on kindle
B00007LTIB|5|This is a masterpiece.  I encourage the young to venture into the amazing musical poetry of \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\"  There is a history of rock music and this is a must.  Keep enjoying the new stuff that's out there, but dig into the past.  It may become your future....
B00284BMBM|5|This is the second Daughtry album I have purchased-and he never fails to disappoint!  I bought the first one upon hearing the first single on the radio and was blown away!  I bought this album because the store i work in always played September and boy am I glad i bought the whole CD!  I play this CD at work-it stays on repeat! lol  I will be purchasing his latest CD and I am pretty sure I won't be disappointed!  Daughtry ROCKS!!!
B0094BB4TW|5|This is the best way to stay in touch with friends and family and to find long lost friends from your childhood.
B006GLLREU|5|What a great show.
B000FA57N0|5|This is one of my favorite movies and I already owned the DVD, but I could not resist getting the HD-DVD to view on my 106 inch diagonal projection screen.  At first, it did not look much better than the DVD version, but when I switched back and forth, the difference was obvious.  The DVD looks blurry-like I'm watching without my glasses (or after too much Scotch).  Differences in dark scenes are not as noticeable as bright scenes, but the HD version is still better.  If you have not seen this movie-get it now!  If you already own the DVD-get the HD-DVD ASAP!
B00VFTA70I|5|A gripping, fabulous movie.  Superb acting. Cumberbatch absolutely should've won the Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of Alan Turing who invented the computer. Most importantly it's a story virtually everyone should know from a historical perspective.
1449433251|5|I bought this book for my daughter's 10th birthday. As she finished each volume, I read behind her. A thinking person's adventure.
B00IRISI42|5|I have read most of Baldacci's books and enjoyed all of them.  I think this is one of his best, maybe the best, which is saying a lot.  I found the plot riveting, the character development believable and interesting.  It is the perfect book to take on vacation.  I am sure we will be reading more of John Puller in the future.
B000HEWEJO|5|Huge Jimmy fan and I absolutely love this movie, so I was very excited to see it on sale.  I don't think of it as only a Christmas movie, but a feel good movie that I can now watch (uninterrupted) whenever I need a pick-me-up or start to lose faith in humanity.<br />Came exactly as advertised.
B00P77ZAN8|5|Love it!  Been waiting for this to hit my Kindle Fire HD, and couldn't be happier.  Giving it -1 start for taking so long, but giving back +1 star due to simple awesome-ness :)
B007Z8ZKS2|5|Excellent book. John Green masterfully describes a very delicate topic, the text is interesting, deep and can be a great collection of quotes.
B009NG1Q96|5|Great! I loved this series so much. It is romantic, funny, and a little mysterious at times. BEST BOOK EVER!!!!

B00QTCOJPU|5|Fun
B003G4W49C|5|I really enjoyed this book and I could see how one day, in the far future something of this nature could actually happen. The world is a vast mystery.
B00003CXAE|4|Grase is a pure classic I remember going to see it the day after it opened and it was packed I waited for 3 hours for tickets but it was worth it ANYWAYS <BR>  Grease is about a High School boy who meets this girl (Sandy) on the beach during the summer but when they supriseingly run into each other at school, the movie really has a little to much singing after watching it a few times you will relize that the movie is mostly just singing and the plot of the movie just kinda drifts with all of the singing.
B008KYOCA2|5|Easy to enter dates and love the monthly view.  Icons are not only fun but helpful.  I am so pleased with the app.
B007SYWFRM|5|My daughter and I play this together and love it. It is very user friendly and I've seen a wide range of ages playing it.
B007N85POS|5|This is so fun to play it's addicting but so many different levels to play .so try it it's worth playing
B00TPEMK3M|1|This was the worst musical, worst story line and we had to force ourselves to watch most of it, but finally gave up and stopped.  Every song sounded exactly the same from the lyrics to the music up to and including the overdone repetitive ending to each.  Obviously, made for those Hollywood types that celebrate &#34;weird&#34; as art.
B000PEX1IE|5|Loved it in my 30's when it first came out. and love it, as well as GB2,  in my 60's. The theme song is iconic & far better than the one in GB2  Very creative, humorous, a fun watch.  Was quite a different role for Sigourney Weaver  after her break out performance in Alien...another outstanding & classic movie of that era.
B005IQ39AY|4|okay
B00127RAJY|5|Just because this workout is short, doesn't mean it is easy!  I can hardly make it down the stairs afterwards!  I really like this dvd.  I can tell that the workout becomes easier each day, which is incentive it keep going!
0062290797|5|Great story, unhappy ending.
B0063GORYU|2|I downloaded this app because I like the game.  The game is the game, what can I say.  What I don't like is the fact that every time I launch the game a commercial pops up and I have to get out of it before I can play the game.  I am going to delete this app today!!
B0081KTI0E|5|I thought it was very good.
B00009Z574|5|If you already purchased the YES Original masters that were issued in the early 90's...the only thing you're gaining here are the bonus tracks...and you might want to talk to somebody who already scored these new remasters...to see if the liner notes are the same as the originals....as they tend to cut, add or mutilate the original package in an attempt to update.<br /><br />I have every one of the original masters from the 90's and dont intend on parting with them...or investing in a complete new library...considering the sound on my existing cd's is excellent.<br /><br />In the case of THIS cd...they included the album that was supposed to follow this album...as bonus tracks...a bit on the weak side..as far as performance....but the TORMATO album was probably the weakest of all the regular YES albums....so at least it could have been served up as a double album...(In my opinion...DRAMA is the weakest of all YES's album catalogue..I dont consider DRAMA to be a true YES album...as you cant have YES without Jons signature vocals....He and Chris have been YES's trademark vocals since the beginning.)
B00AQM8H9I|3|It's cute but it got too repetitive.  I had fun playing it for a while but got bored with it pretty quickly
B0028K31CE|5|What a Maxwell come back. I love his sexy,smooth silky voice and lyrics.  Grab this one !
B002ZG99A4|5|EXCELLENT--NO PROBLEMS--THANKS
0321714113|4|Nice and touches upon the new things in C++ '11. Not for beginners since descriptions are short and sweet,<br />but good for intermediate programmers and beyond.

0790729628|5|I'll stand in line to be the millionth to review Blade Runner. I love both the first release with the voiceovers & also the Director's Cut - there were two ways to skin the cat (Blade Runner test image). Blade Runner is a brain wave opera that walks the tightrope on love & anger,good & evil,male & female,beauty & grotesque. The cast was all wonderful - especially Sean Young as Rachael, who walks the tightrope on human & perfection.  The Vangelis soundtrack including the beautiful \\"Blade Runner Blues\\" is now available through Amazon.
0671027573|5|I originally owned a hard copy of this novel but when I got a Kindle I immediately bought the digital edition  as well so that I could reread at whim.<br /><br />Mr. Perfect by Linda Howard is the perfect blend of humor, suspense and romance. This story gives us the quintessential overprotective, alpha cop hero balanced with a quirky, smart, and independent heroine. True perfection!
B007J4T2G8|5|This for me was a page burner. I truly could not put it down. I read a lot of books and am suprised at some of the low ratings. The context may not have been your thing but the story flowed and the characters grew with the story. Hands down the best triology to read.
B000002KFJ|5|Absolute master piece!!!!!! I truely believe one of sabbaths best.  If true hard and heavy sabbath is what you crave, well my friends you've found it!
0399143904|2|Don`t read this book, it isn`t worth the time and money! No real characters in this book, just killing machines on both sides of the law trying to look at least a little human, but failing. Lots of stereotype  impressions. The only good thing is the tension during the  counter-terrorist attacks but everything is over soon and you have to wait  for the next terrorist happening because the story between the action is so  boring.
B004JN1CW4|5|It was the best out of the whole series. 5 stars...more like 100 stars. Take your time reading, helps. WICKED is good is to remember
0790749815|4|&quot;North by Northwest&quot; has been hailed as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces. In terms of script, acting and intrigue, that is absolutely true. &quot;North by Northwest&quot; can be enjoyed for the same reasons as virtually ever other Hitchcock film, particularly because they keep the viewer guessing until the very end.<br />However, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; adds another dimension for your viewing interest. It is perhaps the worst-edited movie of its quality that I've ever seen. There are hanging boom mikes, reflections in mirrors, and visible scenery curtains. Two things to particularly look for: the missing roof on Cary Grant's cab near the beginning of the film, and a little boy with his hands on his ears BEFORE Eva Marie Saint even produces her pistol in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria. The missing roof might not be visible in some prints, especially those which have been modified for TV screens, but the boy is evident in every version and is always a howl for those who know he's there.<br />Even with the errors, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; is a wonderful movie, and is something worth owning -- particularly on widescreen DVD, so you can freeze, and even magnify, the mistakes!
0316225932|5|Love all books by Michael Connelly. This is Bosch at his best.
B00005J6SZ|4|First half of Like a Virgin is Madonna's best ever album side she ever cut! Second half of record is absolutely horrible! For Madonna what gives? It's as if she is on autopilot and doesn't know exactly where to go! Stay is alright but doesn't hold up while Dress You Up is rightly disowned as a crime she didn't commit while Shoo-bee-doo and Pretender are awful! So how does Like a Virgin hold up? The First side is much, much better! The two big hits Material Girl and the #1 hit title cut are iconic with her voice slowly but surely getting better while Lola paean Angel and underrated gem<br />Over and over are brilliant songs! Moreover on Intro ballad Love Don't Live Here Anymore, Madonna Cries for the very first time about her mother's death - for Madonna was just getting started about crying her heart out. It would not be the last time she would do this. In the end, Like a Virgin made her a star but like she sang later in life Nobody's Perfect but Madonna will forever be brilliant. Madonna forever in her brilliance!!
0060763280|5|The book is powerful,that is why I purchased it.  It is simple and direct. This is my first purchase of this author, but I know I will buy more.
B00IMYZOBQ|4|Worth a watch for special effects.  Story is okay but a little surprised it was up for an Oscar.  .
B00DR0PDNE|5|I would order a different product if I wanted to &#34;cast&#34; from my computer.
B00B0LPWU6|5|I have seen it before, but loved watching it again. Denzel Washington is great - the storyline was powerful. I give it 5 stars.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Interesting game. I will enjoy seeing what happens when you move to the next levels. The first few levels are well thought out.
1451696205|5|This book has depth, substance and charm. You may not have similar personal experience to draw from but you will be able to identify with the emotions conveyed. Great read and helps you put life back into perspective.
B002EXGQO0|5|Historical accuracy is key as well as incredible costumes, set, drama, and action. Writing is filled with wit, but also incredibly poignant. Excellent film.
B0013D8LCW|5|This touching coming-of-age story feels utterly real and contemporary. The characters have the SoCal surf culture lingo down pat, and the interaction between the 2 leads feels genuine and totally believable. This is good enough to stand against anything on network TV. The production values were quite good, and it lacks the low-budget feel and poor acting found in many gay films. This movie will appeal to anyone seeking a realistic portrayal of today's youth experience. The story is also universal enough to appeal to non-gay viewers as the gay aspect is only one element in a touching drama.
B004FGMDOQ|5|Intriguing book you can not put down.<br />It was one of the best books that I have ever read! It was so good
B009FZHYKU|5|I am not a reader of the Graphic novel so the plot is fantastic and original to me since I do not know what is coming.
0898705525|5|To know the writings of G.K. Chesterson causes one to wonder how Orthodox he could really be! To be orthodox requires a certain seriousness, a constant respect for serious matters.  Yet Chesterson is known to be a boisterous writer, remarking with self-depreciating humor that mystery novels (his own Father Brown sereis belonging to this genre) were the least interesting and formulaic of all novels.  Orthodoxy, however, represents an odd challenge, which Chesterson doesn't seem to be bothered by at all: approaching the serious matters of true religion with wit, the greatest of the Aristotilian virtues. The result is a profoundly intelligent, and remarkably sensible in the Thomistic tradition, work of apologetics and, indeed, philosophy.
B00AF6B2BK|5|I am not an audiophile and not so picky about sound that I have to use equipment to measure and compare decibel ratings in order to enjoy the music I like.<br />I first listened to this album on cassette for years. I wanted this album on new vinyl, I  did not think or care about if there was any compromise in sound on a picture disc.<br /> This is actually the first picture disc I ever bought and when I first looked at it and could hardly see the grooves, I wondered if it was even playable.  Possibly even too smooth and attractive to play?  Display only?<br />I played the picture disc for the first time and the quality of the sound was great to my not so snobbish ears.  I don't hear any unwanted noise, snaps, crackles or pops. There was not one skip throughout the whole album.  I have bought new black vinyl records that actually sounded worse.<br />In comparision to the cassette tape I listened to over and over back in the 80s,  this picture disc sounds awesome and once again will enjoy what I consider the best album by the the great Iron Maiden.
B000IOM0YM|3|I'll support what another reviewer wrote:  the sound is a big disappointment.  Maybe I was expecting too much, maybe I was spoiled by the Led Zeppeelin DVD that actually has great sound.  The sound on this DVD is not a step up from the bootlegs I have heard before.  The video looks better, some of the extras are very nice but if you are getting this just for a bump up in audio, keep watching your old bootlegs, this DVD is no improvement.
B00D5O7BPU|5|really cool game and I hope for new guns to come for the app like the mg42 German machine gun
B00EEDJHXA|5|I have been playing this game off and on every free moment I have. I found it felt more fun than challenging at first, then it became more challenging as I advanced. Great game!
B00IS87HYI|5|love it !!
B0071XO8RA|5|There is not much I can add to the numerous glowing reviews that the Wool collection already has. My main point in reviewing is in hopes of furthering recognition for an indie author who deserves it.<br />Characterization was wonderful, plot truly riveting (lost some sleep with this one, I couldn't stand to put it down,) and execution was flawless. All facets of the book were excellently done. This is a skilled author with a bright future. I've already purchased #6, the prequel, and certainly will not hesitate to buy any other title by this author.<br />Bravo, and keep them coming!
B00HWWUR1Q|4|Much more action, enjoyable adventure even if a bit too long. Less exposition then last hobbit movie, thank you Mr. Jackson. But now to watch action with the Dragon will have to wait till next movie.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Really enjoyed this 2 installment and cannot wait for Book 3.  So much yet to understand and love the little references to other worlds in the cosmere....
B0016JBCJW|3|Has the Wes Anderson style but I found it hard to sympathize with the characters.  It lacked the level of quirky charm of some of Wes Anderson's other films.  My least favorite of his movies.  I did like the train dream sequence with the tiger and Natalie Portman's super short scene.  The acting was good and the scenery was wonderful.
B00B2V66VS|5|I love temple run 2. It has good graphics + it's really fun. I recommend this game to everyone<br />.
B000QRIGJY|4|Great mystery writing. It's a thriller.  Good, fast reading and very enjoyable.  A good plot, typical of his mystery stories.
0451232852|5|As always good reading and lots of history,Fall of Giants not as hard to put down as some but a great read.Looking forward to Winter of The World!
B004GJDQT8|5|Love Amazon
B006MW3V6U|5|Acting is teriffic. Period clothing, history of time frame captured perfectly. The program exhibits the pressure for change while safe guarding the way of life in England on film for all to see,understand and analize.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I am spending a lot of time playing this. enjoy the game and the extra puzzles! it is a good distraction.
B005K17RU0|4|Really great app! and pretty accurate.
B007H1HQW0|5|I received this in the mail today. I've already cut about 10 wine/liquor bottles. This is by far the best 20 bucks I ever spent! Almost perfect cuts. I watched a youtube video (greenscience.com)on how to do this flawlessly and it's very much working for me. You only need to score the bottle ONCE. After that I used boiling hot water. I just gently poured it on the score line and immediately afterwards placed it under cold running tap water and back again to the boiling water. As soon as I did that it broke apart perfectly every single time. I did have one bad break. I was using a vodka bottle. Other than that this product is actually pretty amazing and I would highly recommend it. I used a sandpaper cloth to smooth out the edges and it took me all of 30 seconds.<br />I don't understand the negative reviews. For me it worked exactly the way I wanted and needed it to work. All I can suggest is not over scoring. It may seem like the product isn't doing anything, but it is. I read the manual and it states that while scoring you will hear only a slight sound or no sound at all.<br />You will see the scoring line but it's very faint. I only wish I could upload some photos and show you all, but I'm unsure how to do that.
B002WCLG48|5|Best movie I've seen since, well, ANY movie! It brings out different sides of stories and reveals more coverage of the Halo universe than what you already know! 5 stars is a good rating.
B00BXUGRS0|5|AWESOME!!!!!
B000EWBKM6|3|I was not a consistent \\"Will & Grace\\" viewer over the years, although I did tune in occasionally. I thought the premise of the show was great when it first came out, but Debra Messing and Sean Hayes both kind of annoyed me. Of course, all four of the main characters on the show are supposed to be annoying in their own right, and Grace and Jack eventually grew on me after a while. I think the show was at its peak during the third, fourth, and fifth seasons, which is when I watched it the most. Then the character of Will started getting on my nerves around season six and I think the show began to lose some of its momentum, so I watched it much less regularly. I did tune in for the series finale, though, and overall I thought it was pretty good. (Warning: don't keep reading if you want to avoid spoilers!)<br /><br />Will and Grace both had a lot of romantic ups and downs over the years. Leo and Vince were my favorite love interests for them, so I was very happy that those two couples ended up together. However, it kind of sucked that Will and Grace drifted apart for so long. I was hoping that they'd reconcile after their two-year fight and then live happily ever after, but it didn't quite work out that way. Even though Will and Grace did make amends, their lives and families took them in two different directions and they didn't see each other at all for the next 16 years. When Will's son and Grace's daughter bumped into each other at college, they didn't even know each other! I thought that was kind of depressing. Still, it was kind of cool that Will and Grace ended up living vicariously through their children as Ben and Lila basically relived the way their parents met. Like Will and Grace, Ben and Lila hit it off instantly. They ended up getting married, and in that way, Will and Grace were eventually bonded by marriage, which was pretty cool.<br /><br />It was nice to see Karen and Jack living together after so many years. The duet that they sang was actually quite touching...they're both very talented vocalists. (I also love that Karen didn't age at all! Megan Mullally was always my favorite part of the show. Karen Walker rocks.) The quick appearance by Kevin Bacon was a nice touch, especially since one of the best things about \\"Will & Grace\\" is that it featured so many fantastic guest stars over the years. (I wish the writers could have figured out a way to bring back Michael Douglas for the finale...the episode with him is one of my favorite \\"Will & Grace\\" shows ever!) I also liked the final scene that showed the gang doing shots in the bar, just like old times.<br /><br />One random thing that bugged me...did anyone notice that Lila's hair was almost black when she was shown as a two-year-old, but then it magically turned the same shade of red as her mother's by the time she headed off to college? Similarly, Ben looked like an African American child as a two-year-old, but he was the splitting image of Eric McCormack when he was 18 years old. What was up with that?! Is there that much of a child's actor shortage in Hollywood? I doubt it.<br /><br />Again, I think it kind of sucked that Will and Grace spent almost 20 years apart, but maybe the point of that was to illustrate that the bond between them was so strong that they never would have been able to go off on their own and form lasting relationships with other people if they'd remained as close as they always had been. Regardless, Will and Grace ended up together at the end, and that's all that really matters. I don't think the series finale of \\"Will & Grace\\" will go down as being one of the best finales in television sitcom history, but it certainly wasn't the worst, either. (Remember how they butchered \\"Seinfeld?\\" Yikes!)re both very talented vocalists. (I also love that Karen didn't age at all! Megan Mullally was always my favorite part of the show. Karen Walker rocks.) The quick appearance by Kevin Bacon was a nice touch, especially since one of the best things about \\"Will & Grace\\" is that it featured so many fantastic guest stars over the years. (I wish the writers could have figured out a way to bring back Michael Douglas for the finale...the episode with him is one of my favorite \\"Will & Grace\\" shows ever!) I also liked the final scene that showed the gang doing shots in the bar, just like old times.     One random thing that bugged me...did anyone notice that Lila's hair was almost black when she was shown as a two-year-old, but then it magically turned the same shade of red as her mother's by the time she headed off to college?

B004EBT5CU|5|Great album, unfortunately it got stuck in my cars rapid changer and I'm unable to use it,Adele is amazing. Doh,lol...
B008JJM88Q|4|It is a fun game! My entire family enjoyed trying to stump it. I gave it 4 stars, not 5 (my original impression playing it by myself), because when I was trying to impress my family with it, the pictures didn't show up with the answers. More importantly, Akinator wasn't very smart asking the same questions we had already answered. It took many more guesses for him to come up with an answer. I had done a couple customizations and they didn't show up properly as well. I wanted to show off to my daughter and husband that Akinator would guess their names with their pictures. However, each time I played by myself (before and after trying to impress), no problems. Annoying to say the least.<br /><br />As far as the multiple claims it's dangerous to install... I've scanned my entire device with 2 different anti-virus programs and they both show this app is safe and my system is secure. Not true with all FAOTDs. One recent app (Fruit ninja) had trojans in it. Sadly, I uninstalled that.
0385343175|5|Just discovered Ms. Steel late in life.  How wonderful she is blessed with such a writing gift.  Only problem is I stay up too late reading since I can't put her books down.  No exception for Hotel Vendome (I live in NYC).  You can study writing technique all you want -- without a natural talent, you can't do what Danielle Steel does.  Book was in a great condition.  Bravo to all.
B007SGM084|5|Love it. I have read it twice & each time I love it more! I recommend this with no questions asked.
B0051OZ564|4|Great special effects, wonderful story line with a great steampunk feel. Nothing quite like chicks with guns heels and knee high boots.
B002VECM4K|5|I rate it five because it is a deep movie this happens in real life and people have to learn to have patient and believe their children when they said that someone is abusing children or grown adults I recommend this movie
B00AB0Z88S|3|Nice movie, but a bit over the top. Visuals (3D) are very good, but not impressive. Also, it really gets predictable and boring at times.
B000001F3C|3|The studio version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" really pales in comparison with the live version. The \\"S.B.S\\" mix on \\"War\\" is just really odd and lacking in clarity and punch. It sounds like it was recorded in mono with everyone in the same room going through the same mic. And it almost sounds like an acoustic version of the song. I've always found the arrangement of \\"S.B.S\\" awkward anyway and thought it lacked momentum. I mean, it's basically a march. \\"Seconds\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" are good. \\"Like A Song\\" has a lot of raw energy, but isn't a terribly memorable song. \\"Drowning Man\\" is one of the few real ballads U2 has recorded and is a pretty unique track in the U2 catalog in terms of arrangement and song-writing. But Bono's surprisingly trite lyrics for the song drag the quality down.     The second half/B-side of the album is basically all filler, with the exception of \\"40,\\" which has some pretty melodies and a great sonic aura which kind of points in the direction they would head into with their next album. I doubt U2's ever performed \\"The Refugee\\" or \\"Red Light\\" in concert. I remember reading an interview with Edge a long time ago in which he said he didn't care much for \\"Surrender\\" because the lyrics didn't really mean anything.     I guess \\"War\\" is widely considered to be one of U2's definitive albums, but while it features some great moments, overall I've always found it to be pretty inconsistent.
B000ICZD4I|5|All actresses and actors very funny. The small town feel was shown in the caf&eacute; scenes. Kathy Bates, who was in Misery, was acting like a comedian. There is some adult and suggestive subjects, so best for adults to screen first before showing to youngsters.
B008QTVNUI|5|This is a suspenseful and action packed series. I am looking forward to Season 2 (and beyond). The final episodes in this season were just so fantastic, had me on the edge of my seat. The actors are all fantastic and in my opinion cast perfectly. I don't want to go into any detail since it may spoil this thought provoking series before you watch it.
B008Y6UNT0|5|Touching story.  How could one not believe in the happenings of World War II.
0805047905|5|...and she loves this book!! Started reading this to her at around 2, and she still likes it. ^5 to the editor for making the illustration changes so that all children could relate to it! This had a huge impact on me as I would have passed on it. Thanks again, it's a classic. :)

B006VFLIYK|4|Just Finished reading my first David Baldacci Book. I was not sure what to think at first, the opening scenes were not overly written, instead they showed a calm and interesting character doing extraordinary things. I did like the intrigue and the characters introduced, I also like that the character is flawed and doesn't always make the best decisions. In this book the main character is a government sanctioned hitman that finds himself questioning a hit. This starts off a chain events that pairs him with a smart but scared teenager in a desperate situation. The story gives a plausible reason why these two are paired and the design is really quite smart. The only thing I did not really like is the foreshadowing that basically told me why this was going on, instead of letting me figure this out. The overall book was good look forward to reading more from this author.
B00004SZWD|5|This is an awesome album! It spawns two Top 20 hits,SIR DUKE,a tribute to the late jazz great Duke Ellington and ISN'T SHE LOVELY?,a great jazz piece. I love the sound of that harmonica he plays.
B001UTW7QU|1|I missed most of these episodes when they were on tv. I really enjoy getting to know all the characters and the stories. I like being able to rewind back through the episode so I don't miss an important word or phrase. I hope Prime includes them for a long time
B00FQMZ5M0|5|Never realized that dane cook was in the film, but not that it mattered, it was a good movie and I really enjoyed it just as much as my son did
B00APUYN0I|4|If you like music and women and college and funny movies than you will love this movie.
B0006GANN2|1|This had to be the most boring cop movie I've ever seen. Not only was it boring, but I found myself hoping the bad guys got away.  The movie was basically about a racist, sadistic cop who spent the whole movie either beating innocent African Americans or chasing a drug dealing ring.  No intersting dialogue at all.  The only halfway good part was the car chase scene, but when Doyle almost hit a woman crossing the street, I lost interest in the dynamics because it was so thoughtless.  Then, if you weren't sleep by then, you get to watch the police tear up a drug dealer's car for probably 15 minutes.  What was really stupid was that they completely ripped the car up, upholstery and all; however, when the owner picked the car up, it was in tip-top shape.  I don't know what other movies this one was up against for the Acadamey Awards, but surely one of them was better.
B0054TKAZW|4|fun playful quality
B005ILWOZA|5|this is a great 2nd cd...it had to grow on me at first but once i started listening more i became addicted to it!
B008A1B5Z0|5|This is a simple app that helps reduce the number of apps running at one time - it does a great job!
B00008PW3Q|3|This record reunites the rumors crew, with the exception of christine mckie. While the band assured us during the promotional run for the album that her absence didn't hinder the sound of the band...the fact is that christine is the woman who wrote some of the most undeniable classics of the bands career..including everywhere, little lies, hold me, etc.  To deny her influence in the bands success would be unfair...however say you will still has many moments of magic to it. At times it feels overly long and experimental in a tiresome way...with several songs being strong but overstaying their welcome....and others simply taking up space...and would have been perfectly suited as a b side and not an album track. The album almost bears a structure similar to tusk...in which it drags on and on, gently berating you with pop songs in a variety of moods and styles...but the band hits its stride when it revisits its summery california pop vibe. the title track is probably the best thing on here, though it does layer on the sap for the finale of the song, which features a crowd of children singing. Destiny rules is simply as good as it sounds...with rich, longing lyrics and the crispness of stevie voice....it's rich. bleed to love her has a warm, sweeping melody. Nothing on here approaches dreams, and nothing ever will.
B009CPJHY4|4|My husband is from India and I have always admired Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench. The young Indian entrepreneur is the one who played in the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionair. This British group of retirees travel as a group to India and of course, at first are quite overwhelmed by the drastic differences and some adapt better than others. One never does, divorces her husband and goes back to India while her husband relishes visiting all the old beautiful temples. The princely hotel is also not quite cut out to be what they had been told in England but the enthusiasm of trying to make a go of it of this young entrepreneur is quite charming and there are some cute mix-ups. Just enjoyable to watch.
B006TF6WAM|3|Sadly characters seem to have wasted their lives. Nice tale however I found it difficult to really like or be interested in main characters.
1442474440|5|The illustrations are those I remember pouring over in my own childhood copy of the classic story, and I have ordered duplicates to give to my own grandchildren.  If you haven't re-read &#34;Treasure Island&#34; lately, I highly recommend it -- the story is still fresh and exciting, and this particular version is of high quality in the print, paper and binding in addition to the excellent Wyeth illustrations.
B00E9ZATJO|5|Item exactly as described. Thanks for your honesty!
B00E13ZRFA|5|Great song, love the fast tempo. Great lyrics. Makes me glad to be a ellie goulding fan. Hope I can get more ellie goulding songs soon.
B00957T6X6|4|Unfinished business doth not bode well! I will eagerly await the next unravelling of this long and twisted tale! All dissonance demands a resolution - write on!
B00AIUUXHC|5|Fun and awesome to play really good characters
B001FEA9QU|4|First let me talk about the quality. It's not THAT bad. I know some of these audiophiles, the ones that can still hear echos of the Big Bang with their naked ears, don't like it, I get it, but for the average person, I don't think it sounds bad. I thought St. Anger was way worse sound quality, but then the music was also alot worse. I'm also not some kind of musician or professional reviewer, I just know what I like, and I like this new album. Do not let these audiophiles scare you away from downloading it. Here's a thought, download one track and check it out. I recommend Suicide and Redemption. It's a long instrumental, and it's really good. Judas Kiss is also good. I've only listened to the album twice so far, and those are the two tracks that have jumped out at me initially.     One more thing about quality, this is not just a Metallic thing, or a metal \\"loudness\\" thing, it's an MP3 thing. It's massively compressed music, it's not perfect. If you hook up a decent turntable, AKA a record player (plays those big black round things your parents have ;p), you will notice a difference. Play some old classic LPs and compare them to the old classic MP3s, there's just an amazing difference. I know, not news to the audiophiles.     Bottom line, Metallica is BACK with this release, and hopefully they have a few more in them. Enjoy!
B00A2AHU2E|5|great movie
B008F5Y7UQ|3|The basic plot of the movie is a little trite and predictable. But it is entertaining enough and, if nothing else, I could listen to those accents all day long.
B00005JLWN|4|In a world where feelings have been outlawed, the underground recruits the ultimate insider to bring back our humanity. <br /> <br />No one can miss the intense action, or the kickin moves that our beloved new Batman shows off for the audience.  A man with who lost a wife, a son and daughter who take care of their father with immense devotion....  You hear it a lot, but this is a true 'must see'. <br /> <br />
B00BESM14U|5|This is a beautifully acted film and the director unfolds the plot in a beautiful way as well.  Though the main characters are in high school, it's a story that people of any age can relate to.  As testament to that, I'm a grandmother who could still identify with the characters in this movie who so beautifully illustrate the wounds - and capacity for compassion that we all carry within us.
B0055SWM08|5|fun to play and a challenging . fun to kill time with<br />didn't mess up my phone or lock up . get it you will love it
B00JCW0BCY|5|A must read for people with elderly relatives. A must read for all who will be elderly, which is all of us!
B004T4KKSA|5|This was a well researched and well written book of the history of oils rise to dominance as today's energy linchpin.a thoroughly informative And enjoyable read!
B00GMV8LIO|2|Amy Adams is pretty hot and the best part of a fluff story about con artists...Jennifer Lawrence is horrible, she can't hold her bad Brooklyn accent to save her life. I do not like Bale but at least he maintains character...Cooper is nothing special. The movie is useless. I bought it on my PS4.
0671722905|3|I purchased this book for an English assignment.  Used edition.  It was in good shape when I received, and was perfectly fine content-wise.  However, the book was so old that the binding gave out/pages eventually all fell out and the cover cracked and fell apart.  It is now cobbled together with clear packing tape.  The assignment is done, so now it is just a throwaway, instead of a keeper.
B00B0LPYXG|4|More than it first appears.  Fine acting.  Integral and involved plot.  Good ending.  Don't have a lot more to say, but I liked it.
B003O86FMW|5|While I love this series I have to admit this was my least favorite book of the trilogy. That being said catching fire is still excellent and continues Katniss' s great story.
B001P5M7QE|5|Got this as the tonic for having watched the ponderous, highly biased &#34;Copperhead&#34;.  Love this movie and it made us laugh which is exactly what we wanted.
B006IGZX0C|5|Love this movie. What a great movie to offer on Prime !
B002ZG97RY|2|The movie was good, but has anyone else received blu-ray discs from amazon that appear to be used, and re-packaged as new?  The disc arrived in flimsy shrinkwrap without the bar code sticker at the top of the case.
B0001NBMEE|5|A nostalgic trip for all those who have read  the Harold Foster books. The film is reasonably true to the beginning of the Prince Valiant series .  A young Robert Wagner is suitable in the lead role as the exiled Viking prince ably supported by the georgeous Janet Leigh and James Mason who portrays the Villainous Black Knight, Sir Brack.  But it is Sterling Hayden as Sir Gawain  , looking terribly uncomfortable in a wig that doesn't quite fit, who  steals the show.  A classic film that portrays the pageantry  and beauty of  mystical Camelot in Cinemascope but refreshingly does not focus on King Arthur. Instead it follows the adventures of Prince Valiant as he seeks to slay the Viking traitor  Slygon and reclaim his father's throne.  With an excellent musical score,  this action packed movie is good value viewing for the whole family.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like it now.  It could become boring if there aren't more changes kn the upper levels.  Will have to see...
B0002NRQTS|5|I have always read or heard this album, along with 'Roll the Bones', popularly referred to as Rush's \\"worst\\" albums. Don't believe the hype. They are both very good. They are also, in my opinion, Rush's darkest and least accessible records.   The best I can describe this album is dark. This album is not for the casual or new Rush fan. It took many years for me to warm up to and appreciate the musical quality of this album. If you like a more engaging and emotional kind Rush, this is a highly recommended record.
B001UTW7QU|5|Good show
B00I29VGMC|5|I'm at somewhat of a loss for words to write my review, which doesn't happen often. This was such a unique and beautiful story. Two damaged people helping to free one another and finally finding a way to love each other freely. Archer, a man without a speaking voice, but with a voice so loud it was impossible not to hear him, not to love him. Bree, the one person who could actually see him, who wanted to see him, helping him to unlock that place inside of him that, even though he didn't know it, was aching to come out.<br /><br />I love the beauty in the simplicity, the smallest things in life can make the longest lasting impression. This book has an overabundance of beauty and it has certainly made an impression on me. One I will not soon forget.
B001NLKXK2|5|Excellent!
B005HWUBZ0|5|I am elated and over the moon!  I have been trying to get Mayer Hawthorne music in my town and it has to be special ordered.  But, it costs twice as much for the store to special order it as I was charged on Amazon!
B0042VJ1PI|4|Good book to spend time with.  Helps you relax yet keeps you guessing. good series<br /><br />A good way to read and relax.  Characters are interesting  and plot fun.  Fits right in with the series.<br /><br />od series.
B00C69EP1S|5|Very well written, erudite, sometimes funny, the real Hillary comes through victorious. A smart politician and diplomat, relentless in her efforts to place the USA strongly in the world scenario and work for peace all over the world. Her struggle for the rights of women and minorities is a doubtless MUST for her, still a battle to be wan. I like the book because it takes you into her private thoughts and doubts, certainties and hopes. Although, in the end you get the feeling that she has had to struggle against and despite an old, stale and defunct political system, with a Congress that listens only to their selfish interests according to what party is in power. Nevertheless, a good read for those who want to  know  Hillary R. Clinton better and admire her stamina, intelligence, political and diplomatic service and work. She will be an excellent presidential candidate for 2016! Let us hope she will run! :)
B000000W5L|5|Each song on this record pours out like its the last of a long and exhausting, pitch-perfect set no one expected.  \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" is a sort of key-note infused in all the rest of this sublime thing.  \\"Exile\\" is the top of the mountain for a strange and mighty band, and it feels like a fantastic accident all the way through.  Start to finish its a transcendent rush of music and is probably the most flesh and pulse three chords can bear. Taken together, and for its purity, it succeeds as art. That's what the fuss is all about.
B003XF1XOQ|4|After Catching fire I think the Mockingjay is a bit long and boring but still a good book, it was a good ride
B00TYB95I4|5|Great movie. Shows spirt and drive that most don't understand.
B009UX2YAC|5|You should totes get this game.I would get it again if I could.AND ITS ABOUT TIME THEY HAD AN UPDATE.

B00IHMEAYK|5|I really enjoyed this book. very thought and emotionally provoking. the ending really gets to you you feel tsukuru he same pain he felt in his heart....you imagine what might have happened and makeup your own scenario.
B0016NF06O|5|These two great talents have come together and made one of the best cd's I own. The music is awesome !!
B0055EAJ7A|5|I was never a Thor fan; the only superhero comics I read growing up were Superman ones.  But I was curious about and wanted to see the movie when it came out.  I loved this movie!  I saw it 3 times:  once by myself, once with my 24 yr. old daughter, and then with my husband, who finally decided to give it a try and loved it, too!  Chris Hemsworth was the perfect actor to play the lead.  Besides being very good-looking, he is talented and easily portrayed the different emotions needed:  arrogance, strength, fierceness, humility.  I'm so glad to hear there's going to be a sequel!  In the meantime, I'll enjoy the character of Thor in the upcoming Avengers movie.
B00JOM7SKA|5|I love Harry Bosch He moves with the timed and are using a laptop now!
B0000AQS0F|5|Could have been the American &#34;Dr. Who&#34; if these space cowboys had been permitted to continue the series. Characters are well developed and consistent. Always rough enough around the edges to titillate, and never takes itself too seriously. Really worth watching several times.
B0043GAZYS|5|One of my favorite movies. Looks awesome on Blu ray. You won't be bored watching this one.
B0058EBNAO|1|CONNECTS WITH GPS, BUT GIVES ERROR MESSAGE SO NOTHING IS UPDATED. WORST PART IS YOU HAVE NO WAY OF UNINSTALLING IT. VERY CONFUSING INTERFACE, TOO. VERY BUSY. AS SOON AS I CAN FIND OUT HOW TO UNINSTALL IT, IT'S GONE.
B00IMYZOBQ|1|If you are into special effects then this movie is for you.  If you have any technical abilities then you have to question why Hollywood would think we are so naive to fall for this story.<br /><br />I mean the story line is............ First, let's wipe out the US Space Shuttle and kill everyone but the commander and some no tech skilled scientist (Ms. Sandy Bullock).  But, thank goodness the International Space Station is there to save them however, after she gets there, let's wipe out the International Space Station too.  Then, thank God the Chinese have abandoned their space station and it's close by, and finally, let's wipe that out too ................ Oh, btw, she has no flight training but manages to take control of the Chinese capsule, by reading the Pilot's manual in flight, and survives the descent to Earth.  Really?<br /><br />Ultimately, let's have our heroine, after all this, land in the middle of a lake, almost sink and die (again) only to miraculously swim ashore and walk back to some civilization located down a dusty road, wherever that may be.  They should have had a band playing on the shore line to welcome her back.  At least, the music might be good.
B009UX2YAC|5|I just love playing this, its so addictive that I play it every day 24/7. Even though I only have one friend who plays this. :( me sad
B005HXGE9G|4|I have to say I am bias in this review.  I saw the 3d concert/movie in the theater when it was out.  The experience there was awesome.  The experience from the CD good.  The disappoint aspect was mental in part and musical in another.<br /><br />The mental part was that I was really moved in the theater.  I felt like I was one of the audience or maybe even something better.  I felt the songs.  The CD was a faithful presentation of the concert, but without the visual it just wasn't the same.<br /><br />The musical part of this was not all the songs were there.  You should obviously know that if you look at the playlist, but I really would have wanted \\"Book of Love\\" to be one of the songs put on the CD rather than left out.<br /><br />Just so I don't leave you with a bad taste.  The CD is good.  And the 2nd bonus CD without Peter's singing is great as background music when you want to have something planying and not find yourself sing along :-)
B0053VKP8S|2|My new JVC LCD/LED TV has only a digital coaxial audio output. I bought this converter hoping to convert this digital audio signal to analog to connect to my surround sound system. All I got through my speakers was a click click click sound. I called JVC and they said to buy an adapter cable with a mini stereo headphone connector on one end and RCA type left and right audio connectors on the other end.  This JVC TV has a headphone receptacle. THE ADAPTER CABLE DID THE JOB. Great sound with no conversion needed. Apparently the type of digital audio coming out of this TV is not compatible with this FiiO converter.
B002VPE1B6|5|Saw it in 3-D theater. One of the best movies ever made in my opinion, and bought a Blue-Ray player in anticipation of it's release. Granted, there will be a Special edition later as some people mention, but the way marketing is I'm betting not until near the holidays. Great idea for your Christmas list though ;)
B004GBIE3Y|5|Perfect
B001XV3LSS|4|It was a very interesting movie!  We liked it!  We are not big on space movies, but this one was very interesting and kept our interest.
B00ISYLBHG|5|I love the album!!! The ballad is pretty bad though, Joakim just doesn't have the voice for it. Highly recommend!
B001EJIMUG|3|It's difficult for a film to be completely faithful to the novel due to time constraints.  Having the novel fresh in my mind, this film does a pretty good job of including the key parts, at the same time it is found a little wanting. Certainly not the best Austen adaptation I've seen.  Characters are truly depicted. However, surely Anne Elliot could have had some facial expression other than deer-in headlights.  If you're a Jane Austen fan and home sick for the afternoon, it's entertaining enough. But I wouldn't watch it multiple times as I would something like BBC Pride and Prejudice.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|A GREAT series! It ended with quite a cliff hanger! Just disappointed I have to wait until Jan.2014 for season 4.
B000FC1MCS|4|I this is a great book for an insight into the minds of children normally over looked in our society.
B002MCYWHG|5|Took me a while to install the bracket on my Raleigh Mini Velo 7. I really like the resting pad for my 2 year old daughter to rest her arms when we go for long rides. It also acts as a guard to prevent her from playing with the handle bar.<br /><br />The seat is just nice for her and it isn't too wide so I don't have to open my legs to an awkward position when paddling. Removing of the seat is quite easy when you want to go for solo rides. But you will still have the bracket on the bike.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good worthy purchase.
B00FKF0F3C|3|Ok, but not as great as it ought to be. The story often gets lost in his overall theme -- that crisis to crisis the modern is getting to be a better place. The stories of the various families are neat. But I read it all and enjoyed it.
B00CKOZ8QA|5|Love it, out of this world good.
B004TI5N38|5|I really enjoyed the  story.  it moved quickly and had was full of action and suspense. the chacter development provides just the right amou t of detail
B000EMGAOY|5|Need one say more?? This IS the Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you don't own a RHCP's album then you can safely start here. The RHCP's traditional funk/punk/metal/pop fusion is at it's best. Every song is as good as the one before and disk 2 (\\"Mars\\") may possibly be the stronger of the two. Every instrument is great, Anthony's singing, Flea's bass, John's guitar and Chad's drumming are the best i've ever heard. I'm blown away.
0684847248|2|While some of his words rang true, Peck's overall upity attitude, his pretense of extravagent knowledge, and his downright maddening assuptions make me want to throw the book across the room. Unfourtunatly, I must read it for school. THe first sections were bearable, even interesting, though redundant sometimes too cynicle, and frequently too obviously praising of himself. THe second section was unbearable, the piece on science and religion and the part on grace were obviously written by anoverzealous christian who is convinced that the rest of the world, like him, must believe in God. He assumed that religion is more open minded than relgion, gave an extremely in scientific view of entropy and evolution, and presented absurd claims about how we are supposed to become god, all good things are proff of God, and that laziness is the original sin. If you must, read the first part, but while your ahead, I advise you to put the rest in the recycle bin.
B00GEEB730|4|Although a bit predictable, I enjoyed this book. I became emotionally invested in the characters.
B007IXWKUK|5|This is my 2nd time reading this series and it feels like the 1st, this is the most romantic, sexy story and I'm also glad I bought the series so I can read it anytime I want to smile.
B00AREIAI8|5|its so cool how you can take care of the horse and compete I loved this app its turely amazing and great picture. its a really cool app
B0000025H0|5|Good album. Not as good as Inner Secrets, Zebob, or the original three, but very good.
B003VANOFY|5|At first it took me some getting used to for some reason. They didn't seem to have as much bass as I was wanting. And it took some time tweaking with the EQ settings in the Logitech control panel to get the sound right. Then I started getting hooked on the convenience of being wireless and now I just love them. Use them for music, movies, and gaming when I don't want to disturb the family. Especially for gaming they are nice. Not exactly true true 7.1, but it has a good feel.
B000002KCC|5|This LP has been called an Irish Wake and in many ways it is. Recorded by Young and the remainder of Crazy Horse after the death of guitarist Danny Whitten (heard here on &quot;C'mon Baby Let's Go Downtown&quot;)this is one of the saddest, confused and cathartic records ever released (to me, it's up there with &quot;There's A Riot Goin' On&quot;) and I feel cleansed after listening to it. Never before has an artist faced death, addiction and self loathing in such a direct, brutal manner, at times almost to the point of embarrassment (notice Neil's voice cracking and the way he slurs most of the words here) but I find it endlessly fascinating! This release and the recent issuance of &quot;On The Beach&quot; on CD are essential additions to any classic rock library.
B004JN1D2I|5|I can't put in words the way I fell about these books because no words are stong enough to described how I loved it.
B00EEL0LGY|5|This is alot of fun. At first you will be faster than the other racers but this game reminds me of hydro thunder :)
B00E9PMMX0|1|redone and badly
B00IINPXLW|1|Every one of these cut the rope games freezes after a few levels and has to be force closed to get back into it. Many times, when this happens, progress is partially lost.
B0089LOG02|3|It is a good story line but the writing is average.  If the writing is good, embellishing isn't necessary.  Just average.
B00MWD7XR6|5|Just a quarter of the way through the book but it is amazing as usual. He again intertwines all characters,  families, perfectly. I would recommend this trilogy to anyone. Especially someone who loves history.
B00821OX98|5|I didn't know I would really like this series, but I did. Cannot wait to watch more!!
B002GYI9C4|5|excellent, will read the next one soon
B000NQRE1E|5|AWESOME MOVIE, EVEN BETTER ON BLU RAY
1476734941|5|not so much
B001G9LVGG|4|I have enjoyed her music for years, and this CD doesn't loose any of the special nuances of her vocal range.  Could not wait until Christms to listen to it, and then again it will also be enjoyed when Christmas is here again.
B004UXUX4Q|5|I had seen this movie in the local theater when it first came out and enjoyed it very much.  It's just fun to watch it occasionally.
1423141997|5|Rick Riordan is a genius. I fell in love with the Percy Jackson series and the Heroes of Olympus one doesn't disappoint at all. I decided to purchase Son of Neptune with Mark of Athena and House of Hades (I've already preordered Blood of Olympus) because I knew once I finished this one the cliffhanger would kill me. Thanks god I bought them together! They arrived in a cool box to my house and I was just way too excited to have them here. It even arrived much sooner than what amazon said which was totally ok with me. I loved having Persassy back in this book, because I missed him so much The Last Hero and all the new characters are so easy to fall in love with, just in the way Uncle Rick writes. Awesome.
B00006JSS8|5|Who can keep this one on the shelf... I just keep playing it over and over again.
B007J4T2G8|1|At the risk of sounding like a broken record, it is poorly written (extremely repetitive, and is just rough sounding) and exhaustingly un-sexy.
B006LSZECO|3|The ending through me off. But the first half of the book i was ADDICTED.
B000Q6GUW0|5|Dexter is an edgy show in that blood is everywhere and the protagonist is a sociopathic serial killer, and yet this show is familiar in the comic book, superhero sense.<br /><br />In Season One we are introduced to Dexter, a blood spatter expert in the Forensics Department of the Miami Police Department.  He is a sociopathic serial killer who lives by &#34;Harry's Code&#34; of only killing those who deserve it.  To sum it up, he is like a super hero.  By day he is a mild mannered police clerk and by night he is an avenging loner, patrolling the dark streets of Miami and taking care of the serious criminals.<br /><br />In Season One we are introduced to Dexter, his sister, his girlfriend, and his father as well as other characters.  His father, Harry Morgan, adopted Dexter under unusual circumstances as a child and Harry recognized that Dexter was a sociopath with an urge to kill.  Harry channelized Dexter's urges into only killing the truly deserving.<br /><br />All of the characters are highly authentic, this reviewer especially liked Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter).  She plays a perfect, modern &#34;lost&#34; professional woman.  She seems to be a woman who really wants to find Mr. Right and be a mother, but she is lost in the heartless, sterile world of modern sexual mores and 'you go grrrl' corporate/institutional nonsense.  As a result, she is a charming, beautiful woman who curses like a sailor in her masculine, hard edged work-place.  It is a very accurate, very excellent portrayal of women in masculine workplaces such as the police and military.<br /><br />There are several plot tensions in the series.  There is Dexter's love affair with Rita and complications with her ex-husband, there is the office politics facing Lieutenant LaGuerta, there is the normal &#34;monster of the week&#34; dispatched by Dexter, and there is Dexter's inner superhero angst, but the most important thing is The Ice Truck Killer.<br /><br />The Ice Truck Killer is introduced by his work of killing hookers, chilling or freezing their bodies and draining the blood.  The Ice Truck Killer is very interested in Dexter and the two play a cat and mouse game not unlike Batman and Joker, Superman and Lex Luthor, etc.<br /><br />There is a plot twist which shows why The Ice Truck Killer and why Dexter are connected and that twist turns Debra Morgan into a damsel in distress after having her heart broken.  The critical philosophical concept debated between Dexter and The Ice Truck Killer is that of free will the existentialist sense-no real rules, no God, no morality, ultimate freedom with full responsibility, vs. a moral code based on a series of moral absolutes.  The Ice Truck Killer is on one side, and Dexter stands with a moral code.  All of it is excellent TV and excellent entertainment.ir bodies and draining the blood.

B0063GORYU|1|Not very challenging.  Eric Sniders is more creative.  I would not play this on a regular basis.  I would delete this.
B00LTI52XW|5|Five*****
B000VM9Z8K|4|Lots of fun to read.  Happy writing can be refreshing after all the angst of most novel that have a point to make instead of a story to tell.  Remember Me? doesn't take itself too seriously. I have recommend this book to anyone needing a refreshing read.
B00F038CMK|5|The arousal level of this album is off the charts! Wow! Wow! Wow!
B004V5A7K8|4|its cool just like the clasic one i used to play but sometimes it dosent open or for shut down when you in play but it only happen a little
B00DJ4PIBK|1|My daughter was very dissapointed with this product.  She is an avid lego builder.  There were quite a few days when the daily item was nothing to build, but rather hair bows or accessories for the figures.
B002U3CCF6|4|Couldn't read it fast enough, the pages whizzed as I read and reread chapters through to the startling conclusion. You will enjoy the twists and turns on this story.
0780622650|4|I saw this on cable and it was far better than I expected. the casting is very good and it's a lot of fun. I loved the show as a kid and enjoyed the movie now at 4O.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|I liked very much,waiting for  his next book.
B006FO3ERQ|4|I never would have read it but for my book club. I am glad I read it. The book is about a 15 year old boy (He's the narrator.) who has to get along on his own. He wishes he could go to school but never really makes it because of circumstances beyond his control. I liked the way he telegraphed what was going to happen. I liked the goose hunting scenes. It's really two books: a part in Great Falls, Montana, and a part near Medicine Hat, Alberta. Members of the book club complaiined that everything wasn't explained to their satisfaction. My take on that matter was &#34;he explained what he knew about.&#34;
B002GY9F9K|5|this is a good show, used to be on netflix....not any more :( fast shipping)
0385738765|5|I'Am so happy I kept on reading the series, it's a great book had a hard time putting it down.
B0006A9FKA|5|Classic.
B000G759LW|4|I'll begin by saying that this is a good cd. Will you like every song? Highly unlikely, but you will yourself randomly humming some songs, and just finding pure enjoyment in others. I love Christina as an R&B singer, I think it suits her well, some of her best R&B showings are \\"Understand\\", \\"On our Way\\", and \\"Without You\\".  You will be surprised at the level of restrain she shows on some of these songs.  This is not to say she doesn't oversing, because she has her fair share of oversinging, but I'm not mad at her for it.  The instrumentation and sound of the first disc is seamless and cohesive, but if you're a big fan of the first disc, you may have some problems with the second disc.  The sound is completely different with the exception of a few songs. It tends to go back and forth with no common ground.  <br /> <br />\\"Candyman\\" is incredibly catchy with complex barbershop harmonies and although I didn't like \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" at first, I found myself going through my house singing \\"You've been a bad, bad boy...\\" I like it now- both these songs have an older vibe, not quite the time period she was aiming for, but close enough.  \\"Hurt\\" is one of her typical, beautiful Christina ballads, and she does it proud. The reason I take away a star is because of her oversinging on the songs \\"Mercy on Me\\" and \\"Right for Me\\".  It is entirely way too much for me to listen to, but the subject matter is important to her, and she could have tried to get her point across in a different manner- preferrably not as loud.  The best reason for the existence of the 2nd disc for me is the showstopper \\"Save Me From Myself\\", this song is like feeling a piece of Christina's soul. This song is perfect, it is just her...exposed and vulnerable, and absolutely stunning.   <br /> <br />Some people have qualms over her singing about her husband, but I would not expect any less of her.  Artists should talk about what matters to them, and this man changed her life.  Did I get sick of it? Yes, but Iunderstand that she has dealt with her other issues which we became well versed in from \\"Stripped\\" and she has taken a different approach to life because of the way this man has given her perspective.  I am proud of her, I have always been her fan, and it has been a joy to see her grow, and I cannot wait for the next step in her life. <br /> <br />My Highlights <br /> <br />Makes Me Wanna Pray <br />Ain't No Other Man <br />Understand <br />On Our Way  <br />Without You <br />Save Me From Myself <br />Hurt
B000092Q4U|5|Not quite as good as New American Gospel, but nonetheless a great album. If you are looking for music to enable you to beat the hell out of anyone, this CD is it. Randy Blythe's vocals are absolutely his own, no one else on earth sounds like this guy. He's definately possessed by some kind of evil force. The music is amazing once again also. This is some incredible metal right here. In a few words: BUY IT!
B0001UL7RY|1|Avril Lavigne is so trashy, so sleazy.  It looks like she doesn't bathe.  She's so oily and greasy that she'd probably slide right through your hands if you tried to pick her up.  Unbelievable filth completely covers every bit of her, and if she ever does decide to take a bath, she'll lose about 5 pounds!  Why do you people like her?  Why does everybody call her \\"talented\\"?  Since when does bathing only once a decade make you \\"talented\\"?  I think I know when the last time Avril bathed must have been.  I bet it was 1993.  There was a huge oil spill in that year.  Everybody thinks the oil was spilled from a ship, but I wouldn't be suprised at all if it was just Avril Lavigne taking her once a decade bath! <br /> <br />Avril Lavigne is the slipperiest, oiliest, greasiest dirtball I've ever seen.  She's made it cool to be dirty.  That's so disgusting.
B008673ZAQ|5|I am enthralled with these characters. I now have to patiently wait for the next book. This book had me guessing until the end. I loved it
B000002JS6|5|well, not exactly their last, because the followup to BACK IN BLACK, FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, is also a marvellous album.<br />As for BACK IN BLACK, nothing more can be said. It's rock at its best ever.<br />The trouble is that Brian Johnson simply could not keep singing using that scratchy tone of his forever and, in a few years, his voice was completely wasted, and you would never hear him singing again with that crispness, raw power and energy of BACK IN BLACK, and FOR THOSE ABOT TO ROCK. Of coouse, when playing live, the vibe of the concert will amke you forget abou that. But jsut lsiten to BALLBREAKER and STIFF UPPER LIP to see what I mean...
B00JVZ0DQG|1|Cannot contact their tech support. Was level 26 and got put to level 9. Lost all key purchases, upgrades and cat. So in my opinion that is stealing and they will be reported since they cannot be reached.<br />Fun game but be aware.
B00005NWM3|5|This is a great CD i have not heard i cd this good since i bought saliva every six seconds.  With songs like \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Hangnail\\" and then there big hit \\"How youremind me\\" and the song \\"Good Times Gone\\" probaly my favorite song.  This CD is awesom i recomend it highly.  If you like rock music at all you should love this!!
B00DJFIMW6|4|I love this game, but I have been waiting for the Anti-Villian League update for close to 2 months now. I still have the football theme so... I usually play everyday against my niece and she is like why hasn't yours updated... I don't know why it is taking so long on update on the kindle. I don't play it much anymore because if it. Overall it's a good run game.
B0060QM0AG|5|A fabulous collection of characters and tales that you won't be be able to part with, even after the final page.
B00H71PHS0|5|Started watching Season 1 with my English girlfriend and got addicted.
B00881VLCE|4|Lots of fun!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5|A few things about me:<br /><br />1.  I never review stuff on amazon.com.<br />2.  I am old enough to have seen Jimi Hendrix live before he died.<br />3.  I have heard a LOT of music.<br /><br />That out of the way, this is one of the best records I have heard in a long, long time.  With few exceptions, most of the stuff being released these days  is dreck.  The Rides are the real thing on the other hand.  I just wish it was longer.  Buy without fear and enjoy.
B00KA7JIII|5|Visually, mentally, and audibly appleasing. I've never seen anything like it before. It changes my opinion on games for smartphones. I don't usually buy apps but this was awesome. I don't usually leave review either but this deserves it.
0553801473|5|Let's get the main criticism out of the way - yes, yes, \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" in many respects is far too long and far too slow.  This book is not nearly as taut as George R. R. Martin's magnificent \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" but instead is eerily reminiscent of the half-baked-yet-1200-pages-long draft that Michael Douglas is working on at the beginning of \\"Wonder Boys.\\"  I often felt like his insightful student who reluctantly tells Douglas, \\"Sure, it's beautifully written, but it's like you didn't have the courage to make any choices.\\"<br /><br />But here's the thing.  Now that he's into the fifth book of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" Martin has realized that he's created a unique, fully realized world that has a dizzying cast of characters.  Unlike Tolkien (the inevitable comparison once again rears its ugly head), Martin has decided to put everything into this series - he's not going to finish these seven books and then unleash a Silmarillion-like collection of back stories and supporting myths.  He's created this world, by gum, and he's going to let us wallow in its glorious, bloody miseries and triumphs.<br /><br />And wallow we do.  The first two thirds of the book bring back some favorite characters who were frustratingly absent from Book 4, \\"A Feast For Crows.\\"  Tyrion Lannister flees to the East after murdering his father at the end of Book 3, \\"A Storm of Swords.\\"  Ever the plotter, Tyrion aims to join forces with Daenerys Targaryen, the dragon queen whose dreams of reconquering Westeros are thwarted by the troubles she's made for herself in Meereen after freeing the slaves.  Daenerys must also confront the harsh fact that her beloved three dragons are not responding well to city life.  Daenerys faces innumerable political challenges in a world where political issues are often solved with blood or poison.  Jon Snow still commands the Watch at the Wall, but faces his own mess of devil's choices.  Bran Stark continues his journey toward becoming a mystical seer.  Theon Greyjoy endures the harshest of tortures at the hands of Ramsay Bolton but at Winterfell must maintain an obvious lie for political purposes.  Arya Stark stays on the path to assassinhood in Braavos . . . and on and on.  The last third of the novel reconnects with the action in the South as we get brief glimpes through the eyes of Jaime, Cersei, and Kevan Lannister and a few others.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is teed up for some mighty clashes and high-stakes political wheeling and dealing.  Could Martin have written a much shorter book to get to the same point?  Of course he could have.  But the point is, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is an epic story, perhaps the most epic in the history of high fantasy.  He is not writing books that can be easily enjoyed on an airplane flight and then discarded.  These are books that are meant to be savoured and devoured.  My perfect \\"ASOIAF\\" reading experience would most likely involve a quiet room with massive maps on my walls and a character compendium at my side so I could refresh my recollection as to just who the heck the Martells are, or the role of the Sand Snakes, and why the Boltons and Tullys matter.  I haven't forgotten these details because these folks aren't interesting - it's just they've been off-stage for too long.  For me, that's a strength of Martin's books, not a weakness.<br /><br />Eventually, this epic will be so vast that anyone who can keep it all straight should receive an honorary PhD.  We need more series like this, but I fear that Martin's creation is a once-in-a-generation affair.
B0040HO01Y|5|Great series! Reminds me of DA. Great story line and family show that all can wTch. The characters are also believable!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game and it wasn't on Amazon for a while now it's finally here soooo exited must get
B00005JOFQ|5|A beautiful love story.  It is not the story of two men in love, or two women in love, or a man and a woman in love.  It is the story of two PEOPLE in love.  I saw the movie 3 times, before I could get on the DVD 'wait' list.  By, the way, I am a straight woman.
B006PHD0RW|5|This game is sooo addicting! I love it:) The levels are easy, but completing the ribbons and earning all the stars is what makes it challenging but fun!
B00JB3MVCW|2|Bizarre best describes this movie
B00MU9R5OI|5|I didn't order it, but I quiet sure the 5 year old enjoyed it.

0792151712|5|Titanic. The ultimate movie. Winner of a lot of Academy Awards and who knows what else. I'm one of those people who thinks that the movie, the cast, and the crew got deserved all that it got. <br /> Everyone knows the plot, so I'm going to skip that. The acting is astounding. All of the performances are worthy, and are given with heart. Kate Winslet could not have, in any way, played her character any better. She was astounding, and so is her beauty. Leonardo DiCaprio was also good, but some of his dialogue seemed dull. But that didn't slow down any of the movie, nor did it really damage his performance. Billy Zane did well as the over-possessive poor excuse for a man. You really hated this man from the first shot of him in the movie. Gloria Stuart was awesome, and gave a little bit of humor to the movie. The rest of the supporting cast were wonderful, and I can't go without mentioning Kathy Bates. Her character, Molly, was the most lovable woman ever to grace the big screen, but that's just my opinion on that. <br /> Since I really don't know much about the directing elements of a film, I can't really comment on it, but I do know that scenes were well organized and the moods were set just right. The characters were introduced very approachingly, and never really focused on one character while the introductions were occurring. We were set up perfectly to know who we were going to be watching. When the sinking began, the movie took a faster pace, and did it well. All the while, focusing on Rose and Jack's love for each other.<br /> Titanic has gone down as classic, and certainly does live up to that standard.
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Suspenseful and a great movie night film.
B0044KU7KU|5|was a gift for a teenager & they loved it
B002ZG999U|2|like van Damme said it was all about the money, i am so glad the actors like chuck Norris and van Damme did not take any apart of this sell out movie, what can i say about Sylvester Stallone. like he said it was all about the money. that shows people van damme is not that bad. He did not want any part of this movie like he said the plot was weak and it was not about the money to him.
B00HZ3C4N6|5|A pretty good action/spy movie
B0060MYM3S|5|Loved!
B00CO8D3G4|5|This is a book that reads more like a series of blog posts rather than a sequential book hammering home a singular point. But, in fact, it does have a point: how you can be less dependent on those around you and develop enough self-reliance to achieve your desired goals. Unfortunately, after reading this book, your goals may somewhat change and you may find yourself on a different life-path than the one you imagined for yourself when you sat down to read.<br /><br />Written in an irreverent, breezy style, there is nothing really new or novel in this book, but that is so true of almost every other book that deals with reality and commonsense.<br /><br />Personally, the value derives from revisiting a number of issues that should be reviewed on a regular basis. Both as  attitude adjustments and suggestions for further growth. At the current price point, this may be the cheapest and most effective self-help book currently being offered. If only one thing in the book resonates or urged you to greater performance, it will have paid for itself many times over.<br /><br />That is not to say that you won't find gross stupidity in some of the material. 3-D printing of humans as a metaphor for holographic video conferencing comes to mind.<br /><br />For me, the chapter titled, \\"Don't Have Opinions\\" was representative of the books style, tone, and content. Commonsense advice that resonates -- and, unfortunately, is too quickly forgotten over time as we turn our attention to the vagaries of daily living.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, part of the book sounds like it was written by the master-mind gurus who sell information products and write amazingly productive sales copy. But it is probably Altucher's entrepreneurial bent that brings it all home.<br /><br />Full disclosure: James Altucher was well-known and admired by me prior of the publication of this book, as I have read many of his writings and heard him speak on a number of occasions.<br /><br />Now go buy the book andstart to transform your pathetic life or supercharge your productive capabilities.
B00005NWLO|5|I had this on LP in 1977 it was great then. It's even better now!
B000004166|5|Grumiaux's Mozart is clean and clear.  I believe his implementation follows the closest to that intended by Mozart and accurately reflects the style of the Classical period.  Unlike some other renditions, Grumiaux does not indulge in overblown vibratos, exaggerated trills, or drawn-out endings.  Instead, his tempo is crisp, his tone is clear, and he stays within the boundary of classical interpretation.  One can imagine that this is how Mozart was played back in the courts and concert halls of Europe in the 18th century.  Highly recommended and a bargain with the double CDs.  If you want to stay true to how Mozart intended his design, then get Grumiaux's rendition, you won't be disappointed.
B00IRISI42|5|a vast improvement over some of his books...........
B000RH0C8G|5|I'll preface this by saying I HATE sports, all sports, but I love this book.  The true basis of this book is a story of sticking it to the \\"good old boys\\" club by using pure hard facts, science, and statistics.  It is really hard to believe these people were so dumb set in their ways to try to stop the introduction of fact into the sport of baseball.  There's plenty of solid back story and scientific information to keep any non-sports fan interested especially since they approach baseball from an analytical perspective and not a sport perspective.
B009TGODOK|3|A bit too Woody Allen type dialog, no one commits to any real statement, the whole movie rides the middle road... got boring.. As with Woody Allen dialog, no one knows what they want and just flow with status quo.<br />The 'FITS' thrown by one actress as a high-strung artist shows one over exaggerated fit after another.  Plays with the unexplored side of ourselves... not too comfortable to watch through.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I think only one coin for a answer is to low.Some are challenging and some are easy.It is fun and interesting.Most of my friends are playing it too.It is a great thing to do when you are board.If it was more than one coin for a right answer I would definitely rate it five stars.I would definitely recommend this app.
0890090572|5|Being a long time fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' Sherlock Holmes books, I was thrilled to borrow this book from a dear friend. Wonderful illustration's of this<br />character and enjoyed every momemt of reading again, I had to have my own copy!
B008JFUO72|4|I am an Iron Man fan, loved the first two movies. I think that Robert Downey Junior nails the part perfectly. He did a great job on this one. But, the writing, script etc was a bit confusing. Not to mention that I remember from the comic books a guy named Mandarin who was an actual guy who wanted world domination etc. This story deviated from that whole scenario quite a bit. ***Spoiler Alert the whole Mandarin as a actor/fool just took something away from the Iron Man storyline, and to be honest I found it confusing. Why not let Mandarin be Mandarin. Why did they need another person who hid behind his persona? There was no need for that unless they were looking for filler. There is a great but unrealistic connection with a little boy whose' garage Tony Stark ends up in. And, how is it he had to drag the iron man costume around. I remember the costume used to fold up into a briefcase. There were way too many conflicting pieces to this Iron Man. Conflicting in the sense that they conflicted with the comic book version that I remembered. When Iron Man landed on the ground in the ice and snow, his suit began to fail. Ok, he got out. Then the suit should have folded up into a neat compact suit that could be carried. Perhaps because this was an experimental suit, maybe I could buy that. Then there was the scene where he saves something like 17 people who are blown out of an airplane, very unrealistic, but hey it's a comic book movie, I'll accept it. That is, until the train shatters his suit and we find out. . . HE WASN'T IN IN IT!!!!!  Talk about confusing and misleading. There were many other plot holes. What does picking up that little tiny piece at the end really symbolize, certainly not what I think it was supposed to. (Have to watch the movie to find out that spoiler).  **** End Spoiler Alert.  All in all I will buy this one when it comes out, only because I want to see it again. That and I own every Marvel Movie that has been put out, so why not this one too? Should you buy it, I think there is enough fun in this one that justifies buying it when it comes down to about $5 or maybe as part of a multi-pack unless you have the others already like I do.<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher
B003BKF696|3|Some people never listen to lyrics. I am not one of them. And since I listen I must report that the lyrics on this album are laughable, silly, adolescent. Sure, the guitars are fine, but you really need to be a fan of barely-awake-tongue-dosed-with-Novacaine singing to like this stuff.    Here are a few examples of lyrics. If you like them, you'll like this album. If you don't--well then, there may be hope for you yet.    -Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water    -You say you stayed home alone with the flu / Find out from friends that wasn't true    -I defend my family with my orange umbrella    -You and your sister live in a Lemonworld; I want to sit in and die    -I was afraid I'd eat your brains / 'Cause I'm evil    And the worst part is: the singer repeats these insufferable lyrics over and over and over.
014242417X|5|A great story, even for adults, as we've all been teenagers.
B001ANSSDC|2|I found the book to be rather slow. I found myself just waiting for the story to get better unfortanetly it didn't.
0316078913|2|For the record:  I love, love, love David Sedaris.  But this collection not only fell short...it completely missed its mark.  The book begins with a humorous, self-deprecating story about his experience as a Macy's Christmas elf.  It was the warm and familiar style I so enjoy about this author.  The anecdotes that followed were dark, cold, and insensitive.  Not all were autobiographical, which is unfortunate since Sedaris' personal stories have always been part of the charm.  Maybe he was experimenting with a new genre; perhaps he was just finding his personal style.  His other work is so good that he can be forgiven.
0151003084|5|This is probably the strangest little book i have ever read. So simple, yet naughty. I found myself giggling every time I read it. I even read it out loud when I'm alone. A must see for anyone with an odd sense of humor. I have read Mr. Gorey was NOT a fan of children and it certainly comes out here. I highly recommend it!
B0064TVQ5E|5|I'm a Mahjonger for life, I love this game. Have been playing<br />for some time now. So if your thinking about trying the game, dive in. ENJOY!!!!!
B00I8H6MGS|5|Sad but a very good movie with excellant acting by Matthew and Jared !!  Puts a light on Drug Companies and Insurance that no one in Washington seems want to address !!
B004MC8CA2|5|My husband and I travel often, I make sure I read the Bible daily. I have this Bible on my iPad and my galaxy 4. I have God's Words with me always. Thank you!
B000SEJHRA|5|Just about the most self-deprecatingly hilarious novel. He can simultaneously fit into and make fun of most- all stereotypes anyone has run across, and makes the most endearing 'loser' you have never met. This is the first David Sedaris book I've ever read but I will be reading more from him!
0765325950|5|My collection is finally complete! This was the perfect ending to a long-loved series. The package arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
B00IS87HYI|5|Love it just don't like when you can't get pass  leave and ha e to keep playing the same leave until you pass it but other then that it is a good game
B00TYBD6VQ|2|One of the reasons I think I didn't care for this movie is because I'm not a music buff;<br />I don't like jazz.  It is an okay film.  I don't know why I wasn't crazy about it.
B000002UTY|5|Yes, it's great but it's also half-wasted.  &quot;Where do You Love&quot; and &quot;Calvary&quot; don't appeal to me and the song Happy Trails is just silly.<br />  The Five Stars come from &quot;Mona&quot; &quot;Maiden of  Cancer Moon,&quot; and the &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; Suite (minus the  Elmore part), and it's just not late '60's experimentalistjamming.  These  guys use their guitar to sew the web -- you're caught not by the beat but  by the quick yet mournful riffs -- an odd combination that rock doesn't  often produce.
1594489505|5|Sad but heartwarming.
B006MVJ2L4|5|This album is amazing and all songs are breathtaking, especially Trespassing, Cuckoo, Pop that Lock, Underneath and Runnin.<br />It's so hard to choose because there isn't a single bad song on the entire album.<br />Probably my very favourite is Runnin, because I love the deepness of Adam voice when he sings the low notes, it's like having soft dark silk caressing the ears...<br />Wonderful music, incredible vocals, magic atmosphere. The best album ever, you need to buy it and it will immediately become a drug. Adam deserves every single drop of success he's having, but I'm sorry to say he would deserve a lot more: for the talent, charisma, personality and voice he has he should sell millions and millions of albums worldwide. Hope it will happen.
B00BLCHZC2|4|I think it's good entertainment with not to much really graphic violence. I think the setting for the series is new and fresh unlike most of the other programs that are on tv today.
B000062YAZ|5|I would like start off by saying this is the best band out! No band even comes close to what Slayer has done and it's manly on this cd that they do it. Now also I don't know why you punks out there think that metallica has any cd better then anything Slayer has put out. I mean come on Metallica is all washed up now. Sure back in 80's they rocked, but just not as hard Slayer though. There has so meny bands out there now that got alot of inspration from Slayer aka any death or black metal band and bunch of new bands that just came out. With out Slayer you wouldn't have about half the bands we do today. Sure Black Sabbath path the way for everyone, but Slayer is crazy! Anyone who doesn't like Slayer needs to just die! Because theres no band out there like Slayer so quit bashing on this cd and anything else they have put out because it's all good as long as it's Slayer.
B005TQAI6G|5|I was lucky enough to see the Femme Fatale Tour live and I LOVED IT! With a setlist to die for, even Britney haters will be caught tapping their foot to these killer beats. That being said, the show itself does not film well. Maybe it's the way it was edited, the audio, the camera angles, who knows, but the Epix DVD version pales in comparison to the live concert experience. For better concert DVDs look up Live from Las Vegas (the Dream Within a Dream Tour) and Live from Miami (the Onyx Hotel Tour). While those are better DVDs, Femme Fatale was overall her best tour, combining remixed old songs with addictive new ones from her 2011 album of the same name.
B00351ZUHY|5|Classic, love it
B00H71PBQ8|5|Awesome
B004EPZ07K|3|Should people who don't usually like a genre review movies in that genre? I don't know, but when you've got an eight-year-old boy, you've got to watch some comic book superhero movies. Maybe this will help you decide whether you want to take your kid yourself or have some other adult take your kid and give them a nice glass of wine or a cold beer when they bring your kid home--or decide whether it's suitable for your child at all.     Just to give you an idea of my taste, not because I love to talk about myself but so you'll know whether it's worth your time to keep reading what I have to say, I don't read superhero comics and I usually don't like movies made out of superhero comics. I did, however, enjoy Tim Burton's first \\"Batman\\" and Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Maybe I just have a soft spot for \\"Batman\\" having grown up on the high-camp Adam West/Burt Ward TV show. Given a choice between a superhero comic movie and a romantic comedy, I'll take the superhero comic movie unless the rom-com has Cary Grant, George Clooney or Owen Wilson or is directed by Woody Allen or the Coen Brothers. I had never read a \\"Green Lantern\\" comic and knew nothing about the character except that the original DC Comics artist supposedly based the character's look on Paul Newman.    So, \\"The Green Lantern.\\" Ryan Reynolds stars as playboy test pilot Hal Jordan who is haunted by having, as a child of perhaps 10, watched his father die in a fiery test pilot crash before his eyes. This is shown in a graphic flashback that some kids may find disturbing. Ryan does not look like Paul Newman but he does look pretty good in his green superhero suit and has a certain charm about him. Blake Lively plays his love interest, Carol Ferris. Superhero girlfriend parts are hard to play, but she seems extra-dull. Peter Sarsgaard steals every scene he's in as a nerdy scientist who is infected by fear (more on that below) and becomes the embodiment of evil on earth. I hadn't heard of the rest of theactors except Tim Robbins who plays a corrupt politician. Other than the charming Reynolds and the morbidly fascinating Sarsgaard, most of the actors' performances are of the conventional, ham-fisted comic-book type.     Forgive me if I don't get the all details exactly right, but \\"The Green Lantern\\" involves a threat of destruction of the universe. Guardians are a circle of elders who are in charge of 3600 peacekeepers of the universe called Green Lanterns. The Green Lanterns keep the peace by the power of \\"will.\\" The universe is under threat of destruction from a fallen Guardian called Parallax whose power is \\"fear.\\"  Green Lanterns are mortal and when one dies, his special Green Lantern ring chooses a successor who must be fearless.  A dying Green Lantern crashes his spaceship and his ring chooses our hero Hal Jordan as his successor and the first-ever human Green Lantern. Will Hal live up to the honor and responsibility bestowed upon him by the ring and save the universe by destroying Parallax?    We find out through a great many very intense, very loud battle sequences and a few quieter scenes where Carol tells Hal he needs to live up to his responsibilities. The visual imagination on display in the Green Lantern is impressive. The special effects are well done. The pacing is quick enough. However, this is a very violent and frightening movie. My kid found some of the material too intense and at one point said he wanted to go home. (I always make him wait it out because I figure if he sees the resolution, that will cause fewer nightmares than if he walks out when he's most frightened.) Even I was feeling some anxiety at points,  and after the thousands of movies I've watched, I'm pretty immune. As we walked out of the theater, my son said he thought \\"The Green Lantern\\" was \\"really cool.\\" I kind of wish I had not taken him though.     There were no surprises, a lot of cliches, and an obvious set-up for a sequel, but overall I enjoyed the \\"The Green Lantern\\" more than I thought I would.
0553418025|5|Few books move me emotionally the way this one did. Chills crawled my arm when they discovered him alive. Watney's humor made me laugh out loud often. And the end - I cried. It's been a long time since a book caught me so close to the heart and made me cry. I cannot recommend this story enough and can guarantee that I will babble incessantly about it to whomever has the misfortune of mentioning this story around me.
B000001FMX|5|i just think that in all my years as a human...i need them now...and i need a jet black dusty wig to put on and shake, <br />and i need to start performing on a stage somewhere...now. <br /> <br />i can play these songs and only listen to this mad voice. and i can play these songs and listen to a screaming guitar made from my left rib.  <br /> <br />i can't win....i am forever lost to the new york dolls....y'all. <br /> <br />if you don't want to be lost don't buy this album.
B009O5CLZY|5|I love this game. I've been playing it in spurts for three years or so and, although it is definitely repetitive, I can never stop playing without having to consciously tear myself away from it. Once you get a feel for the action and controls it becomes second nature, and the gameplay takes on a zen quality that will have you racking up your highest scores when you're distracted and not devoting your full attention to the game.<br /><br />It's fairly slow going at the start, especially since you can see a lot of goodies in the shop that you're anxious to get your mittens on but can't afford. You'll be sorely tempted to shell out some cash for it (and may feel a bit cheated if the item doesn't turn out to be the gamechanger you were hoping) but if you can perservere without doing so, eventually you will reach a sweet spot where everything sort of falls into place and you move up the goodie ladder at a fairly even, comfortable pace. However, it probably wont be long after that that you'll feel the sting of the limited slope selection and start looking for a phone number so you can contact the makers directly and demand that they deliver the promised prehistoric add-on before you eat their babies or something.<br /><br />One thing that will help new players, who may wonder what the point is in having different avatars you can ski the slopes with, is to remember that each avatar comes with its own set of challenges. So if you are having trouble, say, flying eagles through caves (yes, really lol), you can get around it by selecting a different skier. However, other items, such as the scarves, seem to be merely fashion statements and dont affect the physics or the gameplay at all (at least, I never noticed any such changes if they do).<br /><br />I would advise shelling out for the coin doubler. You may grumble doing it, but just consider it part of the real price for the game and move on. Do I consider Ski Safari to be worth this higher price? Personally, given the number of hours I've spent playing it vs. the number of hours spent playing other games I've paid as much for, there's no question: yes.<br /><br />Anyway, blah blah blah. This is one of my favorite games ever, and hands-down my favorite solo &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; game. Nine stars--five stars put through said doubler, minus one for the missing prehistoric slope that seems like it has been &amp;#34;in development&amp;#34; since just about that time period.r of hours I've spent playing it vs. the number of hours spent playing other games I've paid as much for, there's no question: yes.<br /><br />Anyway, blah blah blah.

B009NH6AOQ|5|I love The Walking Dead. It's my favorite show and in my opinion it's the best show on television. GREAT SHOW!
B000OZ0NXA|5|I like linear stories. This book is just that. Fast paced and on target at every turn. This is my first Reacher book, won't be my last.
1491524081|1|I thought I was buying the book . Very unsatisfied that I received the cd instead. That was not made clear when ordering .
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this game. It's fun but sometimes disturbing  the animals are very creative (in a way)
B00KWVZ750|5|I've been playing it 3 hours strait
0385484518|5|I found the book easy to read.  It shows us that life is too short and we must live life and enjoy it.  I am glad to finally read a book which shows how a person facing death looks at life and his own death.  Anyone who  thinks that life is only work and making money should take time out and  read this book.  They will soon find that their is more to life and it is  meant to be lived.  It has helped me deal with and to understand death but  better than that it helps me look at life differently.
0790742381|5|As far as memorable action movies come, I have extremely hard time forgetting Curt Russell's Soldier.  The premise of Soldier is great.  It is about a ice-human killing machine who wants to feel.  But unlike other people Todd (Russell) grew up under millitary control that brainwashed him to be nothing more but a killer.  It is hard journey for Todd, he has to become human and in the process he will kick some serious butt.
B007IXWL2C|5|Ready for the next one.......
B00005B36H|5|Lateralus just happens to be one of the most rewarding experiences in rock, along with all of the other Tool albums.  DO NOT DISMISS THIS BAND BECAUSE OF THEIR METAL IMAGE.  Many people have fallen into that pit, but I guarantee that if anyone with an open mind sits down and listens to this cd, they will eventually fall in love with it. That is the magic that Tool is capable of.
B005PK57IK|5|Really great series. Would highly recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5|One never knows how a follow up season will be, but there is no question.  This series is around to stay.
B000N6U0E2|5|This is the BEST movie! SO INSPIRING!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!  Just goes to show that YOU are in control of your destiny, you just have to be willing to WORK for it!!
B00MXEPCUY|2|Will  not let me play no matter what I do<br /> I look forward to playing the game every day the same thing happened to king aurthur.<br />Lorenewhite<br /><br />Unfortunately
B003UBTX6S|4|To no avail Beautiful Darkness was just as good as Beautiful Creatures! I can't wait to read 3&4. Lena and Ethan will find out hoe mortals and casters can live together but I'm afraid there I  going to be some roads they are not going to be able  to cross. What is Ridley doing???? Link is who she should be worried about!
B0058EBNAO|1|Turned on my gps never found my location and wouldn't stop trying to use gps burning through power quickly... Uninstalled. HTC TB
B007IXWKUK|1|Should have stopped with Fifty Shades of Grey. Loved the relationship with Ana and Christian in the first book I bought the sequel. Boy was I disappointed. This had to be one of the most boring books I have ever read . Found myself trudging through. Did not enjoy this one at all.
B001PK3M1S|5|The international version of the album includes 3 new extra songs, which are very nice. Course they may not be hit single material, as it usually is with bonuses, but they are good quality. It is worth the extra money, especially as lonely planet managed to import an inexpensive version - what I got was a Malaysian printing - top quality both booklet and CD, booklet in English not Malay. The version of \\"Love Story\\" is exacly the same as on the American edition - some rumors have surfaced that the international one is different, but they aren't true.
B00A6PD9I4|3|Good to watch once. Not the best film Pixar has made but not to bad. The three boys are my favorite.
0688158234|5|What admiration I have for Waris.  What strength, determination, self-confidence and worth to endure so much, to be so alone, and to continue strieving for the better live.  How dreams do come true.  I say,  as I have for many years, the importance of educating our 5th &amp; 6th  graders, by allowing them at such a young age to travel to third world  countries and see how others live.  Only then, will our children appreciate  the free opportunities that the United States and other countries offer.   Children, need to know, that it only requires a little work, patience and  determination to see their goal.  I personally am ready to volunteer and do  whatever it takes, to educate the women of so many countries, that female  gential circumcision is self-rewarding to men, and deadly to women; whether  through death, health problems or self estreem. Waris, keep up the good  work.
B00H58VGIA|4|Well written, compelling story about a time in our nation's history that caused pain in every possible way.  Gives insight into how slaves were able to cope with their hopeless lives and keep going.
B00005JMEW|1|Hey everyone! Lets jump onto the bandwagon and call that Quentin guy in a jogging suit God for making this unbelievable classic. Guys and gals this movie sucks, or blows ...whichever you prefer. Pulp Fiction is on the list of my top 5 best movies, but this?! What the hell is this? Manga story with cheese overflowing on all sides from the unbeliveably CORNY dialogue? Quentin has completely gone into his pre-teens and decided to play toy soldiers with actors after having watched something like Akira.  Ptew ptew KA-Pow!! Tratatatatat!.... Slash, bam... Why wouldn't he? He's got the \\"buzz\\" and money. Plus whatever he puts out since Pulp is masterpiece, right? I had more fun with Jackie Brown.
B000FBJF3M|5|I enjoyed this book very much.  It has an interesting plot, and also has a great deal of information on Roman aqueducts.
B00C8S9W0G|5|One of the best books in the series!
0804161380|5|Bought it thinking it was overpriced, well it wasn't. Totally worth my 100 bucks, the books are all amazing, the box has a better quality than i thought, the metal is amazing, super high quality, recommend to ANY zelda fan, even if you already have one of the books, the rest makes up for it!
B0027WGWQ0|2|The film quality or the way they filmed it was poorly done. Jumped around too much. Acting was not that good.
B004DI7HZ6|5|I really enjoyed this story. I am so glad I downloaded this book. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B000002C1W|4|...that not only do most of the anti-Gilmore folks exhibit some serious spelling issues, they also claim that The Final Cut was one of Pink Floyd's best. Now, I love Waters-era Floyd with a passion, but even I have to admit The Final Cut was pretty trashy in comparison to masterpieces like Meddle, Animals, WYWH, DSOTM and The Wall.  <br /> <br />A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the best of Floyd's post-Waters releases. Learning to Fly, Sorrow, and On the Turning Away are all great songs, One Slip is catchy, and A New Machine is excitingly strange (not really a \\"song,\\" but still good). The only track I didn't enjoy was The Dogs of War, which for some reason struck me as being a little cheesy. Waters-type subject matter, but without Waters to do the lyric writing. All told, AMLOR isn't Dark Side of the Moon, but it's worth a listen, and it's certainly better than most of the stuff being recorded nowadays.
B00IXF85CY|5|I thought, given the hype, that this movie would be okay. We even started it late Saturday evening, saying to ourselves that we didn't have to finish it in one evening. Once we got started, however, we couldn't stop. We did notice, however, that the book thief's most common expression was no expression at all. Her young friend was fantastic. The beautiful young singers with the terrible lyrics to their songs stand out in my memory. The narration was perfect. Who was that, anyway? I would highly recommend this movie.
B00CUWWLWG|5|A very good game worth the data space. Fun for young ones to pass time. It should be bought as it is still free.
B003VANOFY|2|Google G930 disconnect, interference or cuts out. There are an overwhelming amount of people that have issues with G930's 2.4Ghz interference issue. If you live anywhere near other devices that use a 2.4Ghz frequency (your wireless router, neighbors wireless router, etc) then you're in for a treat. My headset, like many others, loses connection all the time. Some gaming sessions I'll have connectivity issues where it'll drop every 5 minutes, some sessions I'll go hours before it drops. But inevitably, it will drop causing you to miss out on what your friends are saying and cutting you off mid sentence. When it disconnects, it takes about 10 - 15 seconds for it to reconnect again. You'd be surprised how much you miss in 10 seconds.<br /><br />Sound quality is great and comfort is great also. But the frequent disconnects makes it simply unusable for me when I'm gaming. I'm buying a new headset and giving these to my wife who doesn't use it as often as I do. If you live isolated from 2.4Ghz frequencies then give these a go because they're truly great headsets for a great price. Other than that, stay away from this headset.
B008B11R2A|5|Beautiful.
014241493X|5|Love how fast it came. Read it in just 4 hours. I loved it, but the ending could've been better. I love the characters and I could relate to them so much. His friends are really cool. Can't wait for the movie. I think Nat Wolff & Cara Delevinge are casted perfectly. Let's hope his friends are cast by some great guys.
B003F1WM2K|5|Loved this heartfelt memoir that brings a textured view if bohemian life in New York from late 69s thru late 80s to life. Prose us sometimes stilted but genuine.
B007FTZDN8|5|TED talks are inspiring, draw-dropping, and relevant. I would recommend everyone to download this app (it's free) especially if you've never listened to a TED talk before.
B00BESFWBY|4|We struggle to find a movie that is appropriate to watch with the whole family. This was a wonderfully refreshing movie in that regard. The surfing scenes were amazing and the story is one that will stay with you long after the credits are over.
B00G958Z4I|1|No Audio with Kindle version.<br />Why you guys are lying about?<br />What is going on?<br />Did I forget something or should I download something else?
B004LWZW4W|5|Got this movies for us. It arrived the day it came out which was great and the movie was good. Great deal for it being blu-ray and having 2 discs. Would definitely buy again!
B003G8Y4QO|5|This is the most incredible show on the planet! You will grow to love Matt Smith as The Doctor. Geronimo!
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I have been playing for a while and have almost gotten grounded from playing so much. If you are looking for a fun game to play... here it is.
B00005UW7V|4|I thought AI described a world where everything good that existed was no longer 'real'. His mother (not just the 'aliens') was a robot at the end, too. He was just fooling himself, or couldn't tell reality, because he wasn't real himself. Had he become a real boy, I don't think so. Just satisfied after searching, but he was probably programmed to know better.<br />People thought A.I. had a stupid, happy ending, I think it was sad. You see his mother never changed in life she was cold and cruel to the very end (before the underwater ship). She did not come back to reunite with him, another robot did, which is why she could not remember. A completely bitter misanthropic ending, yet in an ignorant way he is satisfied. It's technology making our dreams come 'true', only they can never really be 'true' - Look at 'Gigolo Joe' for instance, he has no point, other than to remind people of that. AI DOES NOT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING, MY FRIENDS! Just because it looked like her doesn't mean it's her. It's like Kafka's Metamorphesis book, a man wakes up one day and just is a giant cockroach, no reason, he just is. His sister takes care of him, but she soon becomes tired of caring for her brother, the monster. She throws him out. Many people thought the metamorphesis was about the man who turns into a giant cockroach, but it was actually about his sister, who changes from a loving character into a cold one, towards the same person for nothing of his doing. It's bitter, despite the soundtrack, the smiles, etc. and no one has realized it.<BR> <BR>all the human are stereotyped as being 'bad'. From the brother he has, to his mother, to the people at the 'flesh fair', to the guy at the beginning who feels a need to 'test' the sex robots, etc. Then compare with 'Gigolo Joe' and 'David', good people, who aren't really people, because good people don't exist anymore in the world. Gigolo Joe only exists in the film to show this. It's a film noir nightmare parable. Maybe the robots realized this, and decided to kill them off. <br /> I love all of Kubrick's work and I love some of Spielberg's, though Kubrick was gone, you can still see his influence.
B0054JZC6E|5|fun so far. looking forward to unlocking lots of new game's. my husband keeps trying to take it over so that must mean its fun for everybody!
0060930187|5|This book will drive you crazy if you're not careful!
B007XKEY6Q|1|Everytime I try to open it it will force close and I keep trying and it just does the same thing. I hope you fix this.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Just is AWESOME and the sound quality of your life is AWESOME but the lyrics are going to bed so you can come over and we will have the opportunity...
B007SYWFRM|3|Fun game but could use more features that don't require money or a social network to unlock.  I don't want my kids to be able to really buy items thru my account.
1609611543|5|Very authoritative and solid information never before published and made known to the general public. Startling facts, figures and analysis. The material in the book is not based on supposition nor does it promote yet another dietary fad.<br /><br />The U.S. food producers must be having councils of war with their attorneys about how to combat this anti-wheat bomb that has landed in their (bloated) laps, and one wonders why their own dieticians and nutritionists haven't done their homework to the same degree as the author has done, or have they . . .<br /><br />Read the book, and bread and all other wheat-based products will never look the same to you again.
B00PTB7B34|4|Very fun game
B0083SBMBM|5|The acting and story line flowed very well.  Great adventure.  Liked it very much.
B00IKZX1ZI|3|I love this game but my kindle broke, and I had to get a new one. When I downloaded game again it freezes and won't let me move on.  I lost all of my snowballs,ice picks,and all the other things. I'm not sure what happened but I'm very disappointed.
B008AIGWVA|5|This is so fun. My Granddaughter loves it.

They need humans to live - they need our belief and prayer, but modernity is taking over the piety of humanity - nowadays the human race worship at the altars of technology and marketing.<br /><br />Mr. Wednesday, along with his faithful side-kick, intends to round up the Gods of yesteryear - every divinity from Egypt to Russia. Wednesday is gathering them in preparation for a storm that's brewing - a day of days. And Shadow is intricate to Wednesday's grand plan, even if he doesn't know it yet. . .<br /><br />`American Gods' was released in 2001. It won Neil Gaiman a Hugo and Nebula award, and remains a staple of the modern fantasy genre. The book is once again in the spotlight, with Gaiman recently announcing on his website that a Tom Hanks-produced HBO series is in the works. And to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of this beloved novel, a new edition has been released, complete with an introduction by Gaiman (in which he says that he'd love to revisit Shadow!).<br /><br />I have always meant to read `American Gods'. It's inevitable when you love fantasy/sci-fi as much as I do, that Gaiman's name and this novel will be recommended. So I was thrilled to receive the special tenth anniversary edition in the mail - I needed no more encouragement to happily delve into this twisted fantastical mythological tale.<br /><br />`American Gods' is a cross-genre extravaganza. Gaiman explores Biblical, mythological and fantasy worlds all within the framework of modern, desolate America. The novel is complex, less for the ideas Gaiman is exploring and more for the way he presents his narrative. The book consists of many mini-plots as Mr. Wednesday and Shadow go off on their quest to discover deities and idols of the past. I initially struggled with the veering storyline, wishing instead to concentrate solely on Shadow's quest. But it quickly becomes apparent that Gaiman's twisted tale is as much about the little-big God characters as it is about the wandering protagonist of Shadow. In the end I loved the side stories as much as Shadow's over-arching journey . . .<br /><br />Gaiman's narrative may be initially difficult to follow, but his explorations are clear as day, as `American Gods' asks the big questions in a fantastical way. Gaiman observes the shifting of humanity from God-fearing worshippers to technological consumers. He asks what happens to Gods and idols when there's no one left to believe in them, and does our society still need worship? These sound like big, scary concepts - but Gaiman is exploring them with infinite wit, fancy and beauty. That was one of the things I loved best about `American Gods' - that there's a quotable-quote on practically every page.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's epic mythology-fantasy novel is like Jack Kerouac meets Homer. Gaiman takes readers on a sweeping, rollicking journey across America - from Chicago to Rhode Island and many a dusty town in between. Every sort of idolized God is along for the ride - from those of Norse mythology to Egyptian deities. Armageddon is coming and Mr. Wednesday and Shadow need to get to the real American heartland for the coming battle.<br /><br />Incredibly epic, `American Gods' is truly a must-read novel.desolate America.

B000001ABD|4|I disagree with those who only enjoy the earlier works of Stevie Wonders. This is a great listening, highly enjoyable, and diversely arranged compilation! It has your &quot;get your blood pumping, heart-soaring, soul-searching, and booty-shakin&quot; tunes. If that isn't enough to satiate your taste for music, the univeral language, than you don't like Stevie Wonder. Because, this is very much a great part of his work. I don't feel you'll be disappointed, unless you didn't bother to look at the soundtracks and didn't see the connection between you and the the music. Enjoy!
B00COGY2P2|4|As an actor, Tom Cruise is one of my favorites. This movie kept me involved even though it is a little slower than most of the movies he stars in.
B0007GAEGC|4|This was an awesome CD, beautifully done and melodies that really carry you away.  Enjoy!
B00001OH7U|5|Mere words cannot describe this musical masterpiece which never sounds dated despite being recorded in 1976.<br />  Bowie experiments with a combination of Plastic Soul, disco, dance pop, art/prog rock, and what would be termed \\"New Wave\\" in a few years, and all these facets and formats of music combine into one tasty mix for the ears.<br />  The title tune opens with the sounds of a train, and then a haunting, chilling yet mesmerising futuristic-sounding instrumental piece, and first, one may think that the whole song is an instrumental -- and then, suddenly, Mr. David Bowie's angelic voice, as pure and clear as fine crystal, plaintively sings of the Thin White Duke returning to throw darts at sweethearts and of mystical images (references to the Kabbalah) until, against a hard-driving, danceable instrumental background, he compares love to a drug high and notes that love has given his face that special romantic glow.<br />  The Gentleman's performance is no less glowing on such classic tunes as the peppy, poppy Golden Years, the lushly romantic \\"Wild Is The Wind (definitely music to make love by), the catchy TVC-15, whose lyrics may seem like nonsense to the uninitiated but is really the story of an hallucination Bowie's bestie (Iggy Pop) had of his sweetheart disappearing into a television set, and the gorgeous, hypnotic \\"Stay,\\" which wouldn';t have been out of place at your local disco, regular or roller, back in the 70s.<br />  Definitely a classic and highly recommended. Five stars, my eyelash! I'd give it TEN stars if I could!
1608871827|5|Literally consumed every page of the book. Great insight to a really enjoyable movie.<br />You'll watch Pacific Rim in a new light after understanding the passion for the film. :)
B00HDMMISA|5|I love her books, the only problem is that I'm not sure which character represents me, I think that I am a little of all of them. Excellent read, well written
B00FAPF5U0|5|Highly addictive game, even for people who are not gamers.  Why can't I quit?  What is this obsession with Candy Crush?  Why must I drive my family insane with the &#34;delicious&#34; and &#34;sweet&#34;?  These are questions that can't be answered.  You just have to try it for yourself.

1236705122|3|I did not like the pamphlet style format.  I found it hard to read and had to fold back one side or the other.  Also, the text was small and hard to read.  When I ordered the book I was not aware it was this unusual size.
B00PTB7B34|5|Very fun to play should try
B00BAXFDLM|2|I wanted to like this book. It is on every SF list for suggested reading, so I gave it an honest try. There is some terrific creativity and imagery, and I was interested in the story, but preventing me from forming a solid mental image of the characters because of gender omission (or unless I read it wrong, gender perspectives changing) was something I couldn't get past. This is a personal issue, I'm sure I missed out on some great storytelling by not sticking with it, but as I am a person who casts most of the characters in my mind, I just couldn't do that here. Preventing me from forming a solid mental image of the characters prevented me from anchoring into the story, then I lost interest about halfway through.
B002HJ9PTO|5|It is an excellent product at low cost
B00IIXDW0G|5|this show is hilarious! the different personalities are awesome! everyone needs some extra laughter in their lives!!! start at the beginning with season 1
B002ZHKZEM|5|Very awesome!!!!! lol Been looking forward to buying this for a long time. Love the cover of both the cover and the case. Simply awesome.
B005COO1X6|5|Another great Stephen King story.  He never disappoints me.  Scary but not as scary as he can be which is great for a chicken like me.
B000FCKC4C|2|Spoiler Alert:<br />The Secret of Everything that you're Looking for, is in your Own Backyard, or Possibly under The Kitchen Sink, Next to The Paper Towels.
B00992CF6W|5|You should buy it so fun you can live in the villages or build a house please buy worth the price trust me :D
B007SGLZP8|5|I liked the book for its outstanding plot.  Halfway through, I couldn't put the book down as it had me totally enthralled.
B000002MK8|4|I've never been a Rod Stewart fan, having hated his mid-period 'If you think I'm sexy' stuff and then just gave up on him until I heard this. A superb unplugged session from the early 1990's.<br /><br />Starting with a fiery version of 'Hot Legs', you know immediately this is Rod Stewart going back to his early 70's rock 'n' roll best. Track three is 'Handbags and Gladrags', now very familiar in the UK as the theme to 'The Office' that it came as quite a shock to here somebody sing it. I haven't heard the original version but this must push it close.<br /><br />Its not a perfect album though. Rod should have left Tom Waits 'Tom Traubert's blues (walting matilda)' well alone. Once you've heard Tom Waits original version nothing else is worth listening to. If you don't know Tom Waits, he has a voice that makes Rod Stewarts sound like an operatic soprano!<br /><br />Fortunately Rod saves the best until last and 'Mandolin Wind', 'Highgate Shuffle' and 'Stay with Me' are all rock 'n' roll Rod from the early 70's - absolutely superb. Sadly the DVD of this isn't available, but it was filmed, and hopefully it will be released one day.
0143038419|5|I truly Love the way the author describes every journey and every path in her life in the book, I felt as if i was the one traveling as well it was such a vivid experience...it grab my attention the moment i opened the book could not stop reading it and finished reading it in less than a week. What can I say is such a wonderful great book.
B007J4T2G8|5|I was hesitant about reading this book because it strays from my normal selections (thrillers).  I really enjoyed 50 shades, it's well written and quite educational!
0385484518|5|I laughed, I cried, then I cried some more and most of all I was touched.  I don't mean that this book simply hit a raw nerve - it truly touched my soul and made me look at my life anew.  Trust me, I  made a few changes.   That is what kind of book Tuesday's With Morrie is.<br />Pick this book up and  treasure it - give it to your loved ones.  Tuesday's With Morrie is a true  story written by Mitch Albom, one of the top sports writers in the country  (he writes for the Detroit Free Press and has a radio show).  Morrie was a  professor and Mitch one of his students and friends.  Over the years they  lost touch but when Mitch heard that Morrie was terminally ill with Lou  Gerhig's disease he rushed to reconnect with his mentor.<br />This book is the  result of the Tuesday afternoons that they spent together before Morrie  passed away.  Within these pages, the reader gets to know Morrie and to  love him.  The reader learns what a person really looks back on at the end  of their life and what is really important - love, laughter, family and  friendships. <br />Mitch speaks in a very clear and comfortable voice.  He is  never afraid to really open up, admit his weaknesses and his faults.  It is  this openness and honesty that really draws the reader in - without this  the book would not have been the smash hit that it is.   <br />This book  should be required reading for the course of Life 101.   I have never been  so moved by a book and never has one made such an impact on my life.
B001TDJYWC|4|I haven't watched Critters yet. I think it will be funny and scary. I really like the title, Critters, but the poster is too scary. I have a hunch this is going to be pretty good and I'm gonna watch it tomorrow night after hebrew school. Would watch it tonight but my brother is using the dvd player to watch 'The Croods'.
B005GFPZYK|5|After I saw the movie \\"American Sniper\\", I had to read the book to hear Chris's story in his own words.  I wasn't disappointed...this book is like sitting at home listening to a friend.  It's full of real life emotion as well as adventure and heartbreak.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in getting a behind the scenes look into war and the men and women who sacrifice for us daily.
B008JGSM6G|4|I really enjoy this simple puzzle game. Great when you have a few minutes to kill. Difficulty ramps up nicely and I like the dripping water sound the game makes. Galaxy NEXUS.
B00HHYEOV8|5|Beck has a chameleon quality that seems to frustrate fans and critics alike. It's hard to predict where he's going. But this album of acoustic melodic tunes is amazing, harking back to the days of early Pink Floyd (the 'Meddle' period) and Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Why Beck wanted to go there, I can't say. I'm glad he did.<br /><br />Every song is a keeper, and the collection is riveting. 'Unforgiven' has my vote as one of the year's best tracks: it's moody, dark, and hypnotic. (The return to E-minor throughout is a neat hook, and the change to A-minor before the verse sends a chill).<br /><br />I listen to the album on vinyl and I think it was mixed for vinyl perfectly. Every note jumps out on a sweeping sound stage. From an audio and musical perspective, high quality indeed.
B004SBS8LA|3|But, I quickly reached the limit of what I found interesting and fun. When it became impossible, I let it go.
B00005V9IK|3|Before superpowered crimefighting men in tights dominated the summer movie landscape, there were asteroids (Armageddon, Deep Impact), tornadoes (Twister), and giant lizards (Godzilla) destroying national landmarks that caused people to flock to their air-conditioned movie theaters in the summer months. But the film that seemingly started it all was 1996's Independence Day.     Directed by Roland Emmerich and produced by Emmerich and his partner (or in most cases, co-offender) Dean Devlin, the \\"masterminds\\" behind the so-so sci-fi film Stargate. While on the press junket for Stargate, they were questioned about their belief in aliens, which they responded that one day we may wake up to find alien spaceships in the sky. At that moment, the concept for their next film was born.    Some call Independence Day \\"the Star Wars of the 90's\\", but Independence Day lacks the religious mysticism and homages to Westerns and samurai films. What it does have is a love for old sci-fi B-movies like The Day the Earth Stood Still, movies made to be more fun than based in heady subtext or scientific fact.    The story takes place over the span of three days: July 2nd, July 3rd, and July 4th. The film begins on July 2nd with the ominous shadows of the invaders' massive spaceships slowly enveloping everything they pass, and we're introduced to a number of characters and their own storylines, so many that I might not be able to list them all here. You have President Whitmore (Bill \\"I'm Not Bill Paxton\\" Pullman), a former Gulf War fighter pilot whom the opinion polls are turning against for his seemingly ineffectiveness and lack of resolve. You have M.I.T. grad turned cable guy David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) whom is still coping with his divorce and uncovers the aliens' secret plan. You have Air Force pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith), who applies to be an astronaut but is rejected because of his relationship with his girlfriend, a stripper and single mom named Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox). Oh, and then there's Randy Quaid's Russell Casse, a Vietnam War veteran who spends his days in a drunken stupor, supporting his three children as a crop duster and recalling his own alien abduction. All of their destinies somehow intersect throughout the film as the extraterrestrials launch their attack,     The aliens attack on July 2nd, blasting blue-green rays of energy down on major cities around the world, causing tidal waves of fire that kill millions and leave the cities in flaming ruins. The Earth forces mount an aerial counterattack on July 3rd, but are vastly outnumbered and quickly overwhelmed by the swarm of technologically-advanced aliens, whom then take out most Army bases. Frustrations mount as it becomes more and more apparent that the aliens seem unstoppable. The remaining American forces retreat to the modern-day mythical Area 51, where they organize one final strike at the aliens on July 4th.    Many of the characters are stock and cliche, like the science whiz no one wants to listen to but who is always right, or the trigger-happy government suit whose only response to a problem seems to involve firing all available weaponry at the enemy despite the repeated failure of said weaponry. (Emmerich and Devlin are known for falling back on these very cliches in their other movies, as evidenced by their Independence Day follow-up Godzilla), and several of the plot points seem highly contrived and unlikely. A simple computer virus being compatible with advanced alien technology seems ridiculous, so the possibility that said computer virus being capable of taking down technologically-advanced alien force fields is even more ridiculous, and that's saying a lot when you're talking about a movie about an alien invasion. But the special effects are the real stars here (though some shots do look noticibly green-screened if you look closely), and the underdog story of outgunned and outmatched Earth forces taking on a seemingly invincible alien threat is a crowd pleaser. And you can't help but cheer a little bit when poor Russell Casse gets his revenge. This is probably the best film by Emmerich and Devlin to date, something that doesn't look to be changing anytime soon.
B00006BTCA|1|Interpol, like many other bands riding the Post Punk/80's rock scene wave lack clarity and vision. And while their influences are interesting, essentially their music goes no further than the sounds of those earlier ground breaking bands. Joy Division ceased to exist over 20 years ago and unfortunately the only facet Interpol has chosen to resurrect from JD and alike bands is the melodrama; which does not alone make for good music. If you are going to spend your hard earned cash, invest it in music that strives toward originality and innovation regardless of when it was created, be it 1979 or 2003
B00MIA0KGY|3|Not her best effort.....  If I had heard it first, I would not have bought it..
1451648537|5|A fiction fanatic, this is the first biography I have ever read and I was up until 3am for about a week every night reading it.  If this is what all biographies are like then I obviously haven't lived yet.  I never really knew much about Steve Jobs except that he was CEO of Apple, that he and Bill Gates began the computer industry together and diverged somewhere along the way, that he maybe wasn't the nicest person on earth.  My main thought regarding him though and I remember it clearly when my Ipod hit the sickbed in 2002 was \\"what kind of raging narcissist calls his help desk the 'Genius Bar'??  Well, turns out most of those preconceived notions were pretty accurate.  Yes, he was a raging narcissist but he actually hated the name \\"Genius Bar\\" and had to be talked into it by his Apple crew.<br /><br />After reading this book, you will most likely have complex feelings for whether you like or dislike this man and I think that's what makes this \\"authorized biography\\" so different.  It's long but you will breeze through it.  My only qualm is that the author reiterates certain points so many times that I would have instead liked to hear a few more personal stories.  For instance, yes Jobs lived at Technology and Arts intersection and that convergence of interests defined his career but the author beats this horse to death.  Similarly, countless times Jobs is \\"brutal\\" to people, ripping them to shreds in front of others and the author reiterates this point over and over.  But why he does this and how this behavior affected his personal/work relationships is never discussed in detail.  Those are my only, very minor gripes about the book.<br /><br />As I was wrapping up reading this book, I ran into Target the other night to get something and as soon as I walked inside I immediately noticed the design of the store, the layout, positioning of items and cash registers and how they could have done it better and I thought, \\"OMG I've been Jobified.\\"  I really couldn't be moredifferent than Jobs in that I am oblivious to my surroundings most of the time.  After reading this biography, I hope to become a little more in tune with my surroundings (not nearly as much as his neurotic self was) and to question the quality of things I am accepting.  One thing this man did not lack was passion.  It's amazing how many days we wake up and just sleepwalk through our routine thinking that our path is pre-defined and there is little we can do to change it.  Steve Jobs never accepted that and demanded better of products and people.  His extreme passion (as well as eating disorders) may have even contributed to his demise.  But the fact that I want to be a little more passionate in life is a tribute to this book.<br /><br />But just because certain aspects of Jobs inspired me doesn't mean the author sugarcoats his difficult personality.  He was notoriously horrible in his personal relationships and the author definitely does not ignore this.  One thing I was left thinking after this book was that maybe you can't be it all.  Maybe you can't be a wonderful person, great parent, and change the world.  Jobs couldn't be all three and he chose to change the world.  Bill Gates handed over his company years ago to focus on his family and philanthropic issues.  But look at what suffered:  innovation.  Yes I'm glad I have never been on the receiving end of Jobs' humiliation but I'm glad he existed to demand better for us.  And God how I love my Iphone.

B000RZOR2U|5|Attractive box -- more colorful than image makes it appear.  Two thick booklets that give overview of Bach's work and performance conditions, and a brief synopsis and review of each and every cantata (but no lyrics).  Generally slower pace on many cantatas than most and boy sopranos throughout -- both can take a bit of getting used to if you are used to faster tempos and larger forces -- but I have grown to really enjoy this style.  My usual gripe is that I wish they arranged the cantatas by week rather than number, but week info is provided in the booklets (although no week by week index).  Glad I bought this.
0807014273|4|What can a person expect of life in a concentration camp? Is there a chance you can find meaning in living that torture? This is a truly inspirational book that reminds you that not everything is lost, that you can find light in the most terrible conditions. It's not new age, it's a story of survival and hope.  The second part of the book is about logotherapy. Victor Frankl was the creator of this discipline and it basically addresses the question of meaning in people's lives.
B009OYSFDM|5|We love this show and were introduced to it, got all caught up through Amazon.  Now we watch it on Wednesday nights.
B0006L16N8|5|Coldplay's new album is fabulous. It is a success from start to finish. This new CD is clearly better than their others. Every song is a potential classic. Not only have they given Rock a new flavor, but an interesting outlook. The grand sweeping melodies are triumphant. You become a legend when you record something that's memorable, that's unique, that's near perfect. And Coldplay is really making a name for themselves with their new record. They're no ordinary Rock band. The title of legend just might be in their future if \\"X&Y\\" is any indication. When I hear Chris Martin's voice soar over the piano on \\"What If,\\" I say, \\"Wow. These guys are really good.\\" Coldplay is no fluke. There is no flaw in this genius. \\"Twisted Logic\\" has to be one of the most interesting vocal and musical performances on the album. What's most amazing is how well Coldplay is able to manipulate their sound and still sound like Coldplay. They can vary something ever so slightly like \\"Clocks\\" vs. \\"Speed of Sound\\" and derive a completely different song, one that's better. Their sound is so flexible that it can take on almost any form and occupy any space. It can be almost anything to anyone. It's very interpretive. A CD I would definitely recommend.
B00IRMTTPU|4|Slavery is wrong and it created many problems for this country.  My redneck brother-in-law came from a racist family and some of the stuff he said made me cringe.  I wish he would watch this movie and try to understand how wrong slavery is.
1936608898|5|I have spent the last 10+ years searching for a food and healthy-eating guide that I could understand, enjoy and actually incorporate into my everyday life... and I have finally found it in Melissa & Dallas Hartwig's, \\"It Starts with Food.\\" Their writing is simple, clear, funny(!), and full of those forehead-smacking moments of truth where you think to yourself \\"how the heck did I not know this/notice this/recognize this sooner?!\\" Luckily, these 2 authors have found a way to tell a story about what we eat, how we eat it, WHY we eat it, and how we can modify our eating choices for better health in an incredibly approachable way, while still weaving in real, well-articulated research (they call it the \\"science-y stuff\\") that made me confident that I was getting information that was as reputable as it was interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />When I finished reading \\"It Starts with Food,\\" I felt like I had direction and information that I could immediately apply to my life, and that I also had a road map to help me walk down a new path of eating for the long term that will take me in an entirely new and entirely more healthy direction. With \\"It Starts with Food\\" as my guidebook, source of reference, and Bible for Good Food choices, I also feel well-armed and equally well-informed to spread the word to friends, family and co-workers about their message! But finally - and probably most important (to me) - is that I feel like I have cheerleaders and champions in my new \\"friends\\" Melissa and Dallas. While reading their book I felt that they were truly, genuinely, hugely rooting for me to succeed in this journey toward better health.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough - if you buy one for yourself I can pretty much guarantee that you'll be back on Amazon purchasing additional copies for those people in your life who you want to join the Good Food movement with you!

Flynn writes with her own unique style, a consistent clarity, you'll see if you've read Gone Girl and her other first books. but, boy, are these stories stark and dark.

B001UV4XJ2|1|This movie is a fantastic show, and was a great finish to the Harry Potter series.  However, I cannot, and will not support or purchase any movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy.  I purchased Green Lantern and was surprised that I got a worthless streaming digital copy.  I live in an area where I don't even have 3g coverage, so I cannot stream my movie at all.  Then I got locked out of my copy by Ultraviolet and despite emailing both Ultraviolet and Flikster, I still cannot access my digital copy.  I WILL NOT be purchasing another movie that comes with an Ultraviolet digital copy.  The movie execs are driving my business away.  Now I am looking at buying an Apple TV and just buying digital copies from ITunes.  The minute this is fixed, I will continue my purchasing of Blu-Rays that come with an actual digital copy.

B00FEMJF6O|5|This game keeps me entertained and busy. I like being able to purchase items from other players or making what you need.
B005CRQ4XI|5|I lost my mom 3 years ago and when I heard the description of this book I couldn't help but read it (even though I will admit, I did so with sarcasm, never expecting it to resonate - never expecting to be changed.) I was wrong.  Cheryl's words reached a place in me that I didn't know existed.  If you have ever lost someone close to you you know that you spend most of your mental energy trying not to think about it.  Trying not to let it effect you.  Cheryl opens you in a way that makes it easier to access that part of you. Before you realize it, you're opened up, vulnerable and exposed. And then she makes you feel the deepest parts of you that you struggle to keep covered.  I would recommend this book to all my fellow cynics with a hole in their hearts dug by loss.  This book is not a cure, but it is a roadmap to the lonely and hard road we must travel to discover our hurts, how they manifest in everyday life and how we overcome grief to become Queen of the PCT!  Two thumbs up!
0142402753|5|I purchased this book for my 3 yr old son and we both enjoy reading this book.  The pictures are colorful and fun and the underlying theme of sharing with others and being happy with who you are, not how you look, are great lessons for any child.  I highly recommend!!!

B004856SQ8|5|It turned out to be good. Loads of fun, action and good actors' set. This movie is what 'the A-team'really should be like. It was a pleasure watching it. I'm hoping they would continue with the 'A- team' and bring something else in another year to come.

B00A6PD9I4|4|My husband and I rented Brave via Amazon instant video (which was awesome!) and we really enjoyed the movie but thought it was much too scary for our 5 and 3 year old boys. There was a lot of scary and intense bear parts, and people hunting bears. There was humor spread throughout, my husband and I laughed out loud quite a few times, but overall not very kid friendly. We will be waiting quite a while before watching it with our boys.
0738735027|4|the mini version is soooo cute I love it. I think this is best cat's tarot deck. the theme design is very well done based on RW. i only wished if the booklet contained more about cat's nature and not only card meaning. Im thinking to have the bigger version of this deck.
0142410705|5|Great read!
B0040ZN9WM|5|I was nervous to get these shoes because there werent a lot if reviews on them. We had tried crocs before with not a ton of success. We tried the regular Mary Jane's, but they caused a lot of painful rubbing on the tops of my daughter's feet. The regular crocs were kind of hard for her to walk in when she was little (2) and she fell a few times and they fell off a lot too. Now that they are 4 yrs & 2 yrs, I bought these at the beginning of summer for going to the pool, playing on sandy beaches, etc. They turned out to be practically ALL they wore all summer! Easy for both girls to put on themselves, they stay on and can be used for anything. They climbed, ran, etc in them. Perfect!!! We got tons of compliments too. I absolutely plan to get these again next year!  A couple items to note:  - Although, it doesn't seem like all crocs run true to size (they seem to usually run big), but these DID seem to run true to size for us! Very happy about that.  - I got purple and light pink colors. Purple held up well, but light pink scuffed up a lot and dirt seemed to sort of 'seep' in and stain them (not able to wash completely off). So, I'd recommend darker colors so the dirt doesnt show too much.  Highly recommend, hope they work well for you too!!
B004LWZWGA|5|Another amazing episode in the conclusion of the Dark Knight saga. The Nolans and Goyer do an exceptional job weaving in the characters and backstory of a very (some would say over-) elaborate plot, not to mention usher in cameo appearances of many of the faces from the previous films.<br /><br />Just be sure to prepare to settle down for nearly three-hours as Bale, Hathaway, Gordon-Levitt, Hardy, and really the entire cast make you feel as if you too were a part of Gotham. While Nolan may have us say good-bye to Gotham City... it's a really satisfying farewell.

B007XH6BPG|4|I think we've all been looking for more from Chris Squire, in a number of ways, but he has found what I think is the best current vehicle for his prodigious talents. Yes has been too limiting as well as too permissive a context for him. Steve Hackett brings out the primal prog best in Chris, and in turn, Chris pulls out what \\"pop\\" or mainstream song arrangements that Steve can muster to inspire. What results is some of the best mainstream prog of recent months. There is an authenticity and simplicity to the lyrics and the fusion of Yes-like harmonies and Genesis-like melodic progressions and lyric patterns. If you ever wondered 'what if' Yes and Genesis played together; here it is. The truth is, Steve Hackett helps to reign in some of Chris' more extravagant pop tendencies and keep him more honest than I've heard him since Going for the One. Steve should move Squackett even further into the realm of Beyond the Shrouded Horizon, his excellent recent solo work, as Chris's resonant bass would elevate that often dreamy space and magnetize it further. Squire and Hackett's voices come together nicely and the band's sound has more traction than recent Yes, Asia, and Icon releases combined. Nicely done. Looking forward to more Squackett on my prog toast please.

B00BSB2AE4|5|This book has it all. It has laughs, it has cries-although those are from laughing so hard you start to cry. I've been a fan of Allie Brosh's since ~2010, back when her blog posts included actual pictures, along with her cartoons. I remember when the \\"Dinosaur\\" was in her home. She has a way of making you feel like you're her friend. That you are both in this crazy thing called life together. Exploits with Simple Dog and Helper Dog make you feel the pain of having an animal that doesn't quite reach expectations-and you adore them no matter what. This book is a must read for anyone who likes to laugh, who likes dogs, and who can appreciate a woman whose journey is far more crazy and interesting than our own.

0064471837|5|Sabriel by Garth Nix is the first of three books dedicated to a fantastical realm that you need to enter.<br /><br />The story begins in the Old Kingdom, a kind of medieval place, where a man is fighting against an evil. Within those first few pages you see there is magic and lore and miracles happening, including the birth of a baby, brought back to life from death apparently.<br /><br />As the chapters progress, you see that there is an Abhorsen, a magic user whom channels the ancient powers to control the dead spirits, sometimes of dead people, sometimes of beings that never walked the earth. If you thought the 2013 movie, The Conjuring was a nice dip into the occult and that other world that is all around us, then you would appreciate the job of the Abhorsen, the chosen family that sheriffs those that are on the other side and protects the rest of us from them.<br /><br />Sabriel, the title character, is a young woman that grew up on the other side of this world, in Ancelstierre, where technology and the modern world is. A wall separates the two sides. Sabriel is the daughter of the current Abhorsen, and when he sends a book and bells to Sabriel, she knows something's happened to her father, and she needs to go home, and possibly be the next in the long line of Abhorsens.<br /><br />The Abhorsens regulate the dead spirits and other spirits through the ringing of bells. As necromancer tools, the bells channel magical powers to call and send spirits to wherever the bell ringers choose, but they can be dangerous, because your own spirit can be sent into the underworld if you aren't careful. Beyond that there are other more nefarious necromancers that are working for those evils spirits that want to breach into the living world, working against our protagonist.<br /><br />The first book starts the journey into this world. Two more books help us dive deeper into this world. Soon Garth Nix will present us with yet more full novels in the world of the Old Kingdom. I personally look forward to it.<br /><br />If you love movies about spirits and hauntings, if you like books about magic and modern technology seamlessly woven together, if you want a good story to encapsulate your life for the next few weeks, start off with Sabriel by Garth Nix. You will not go wrong.rsonally look forward to it.<br /><br />If you love movies about spirits and hauntings, if you like books about magic and modern technology seamlessly woven together, if you want a good story to encapsulate your life for the next few weeks, start off with Sabriel by Garth Nix.

B005FNPIG8|4|For a movie plagued with pre production problems such as this one,where Van Damme`s proposed co-star Steven Seagal dropped out and the story`s premise was re-written,it is a wonder the film came out as well as it did.Starring along with Van Damme is Scott Rudin(X men Origins:Wolverine) and Van Damme`s two siblings,son Kristopher as one of the two corrupt Interpol agents and his daughter Bianca who plays Rudin`s bed ridden wife Anna Flint.Again Van Damme and company have picked a good solid group of actors and behind-the-camera crew so that the results are quite good.<br />The plot involves the head of Interpol,under investigation for selling and profiting through illegal arms sales.There is an open end he wants closed,in the form of an assassin for hire named Roland Flint.Flint took the proceeds from a sale gone bad and went into hiding after his wife was brutally raped(and left in a coma)and Flint himself almost killed,by a local Romanian thug by the name of Polo.Simultaneously we have another assassin for hire in the picture and his name is Vincent Brazil(Van Damme).Brazil`s oft used contact for jobs gives him the assignment of coincidentally killing Polo.At the same time Flint is also given the job by an old Interpol contact,but does not know who his target is or that there is another involved.Flint`s job is in actuality a ruse by the head of Interpol and two agents in on his corruption scheme,to snuff out Flint so they can get rid of their loose end once and for all.<br />The moment of truth arrives as Polo is set up above and across of the assassination location.Out walks Polo,Flint lines his shot and fires but hits the roof of a small truck as it rounds the corner and into his line of fire.The driver is none other than Brazil who,distracted by Flint`s shot,misses and kills Polo`s only brother instead,speeding off.Frustrated Polo comes downstairs,gun in hand and walks towards the startled crowd.As he lifts his weapon to fire the two Interpol agents in a car near the scene,fire knocking the gun out of his hand.This creates enough of a diversion to enable Flint to escape.Polo is of course bent on revenge and finding out who killed his brother,Flint is more enraged than ever because his target is his old nemesis and he missed,Brazil is mad because of the interloper who cost him a kill and Interpol STILL wants Flint silenced.<br />Brazil catches up to Flint and they briefly have a Mexican stand off in a warehouse.They hash out their differences and decide to work together to bring Polo down.However Polo is not standing still and has his men searching for any clues to Brazil and his whereabouts and distributing pictures of him all over town.Eventually it is a disgruntled neighbour of Brazil`s that discloses his whereabouts.Also Brazil`s jobs contact has offered him a substantial remuneration if he turns his new `partner`(Flint) in.All he has to do is get him to a location and the rest will be done by the ``employer``.Brazil at this point has no idea of the Interpol connection(the ``employer``in this case),Polo`s involvement with them or with Flint`s history with either.Polo`s appearance is the ruse to again lure Flint out and Flint is captured with little struggle as Brazil looks coldly on,another job done.<br />Flint is taken to a remote warehouse and tortured for info on the whereabouts of the money he took from them long ago.Brazil has had time to think and approaches his jobs man once again and asks for the location of the warehouse.Brazil has now absorbed enough information to determine the connections and that he was set up and in turn set up his ``partner`` and does not like it.He rescues Flint and they kill the interrogating Interpol agents.Next on the list is Polo himself,but he is seemingly one step ahead and he has found Flint`s home and is with his comatose wife,threatening to kill her altogether this time.This brings Flint and Brazil back to Flint`s home and together unarmed,they are forced to walk into Polo`s clutches.Polo is delighted at the thought of being able to take care of two birds with one stone but he hasn`t counted on the resourcefulness of the pair.Flint had previously installed a high powered remote controlled rifle outside his home and with the touch of a remote laying on the table(which Polo thought was nothing but a phone),it gives them the distraction they both need to get the upper hand and bring control to their situation.Polo is the last alive,defiant to the end and Brazil leaves him with Flint as he steps outside for air.When Flint rejoins Brazil,Brazil says there is one more thing left to do;actually one thing each.Flint takes down the head of Interpol and Brazil takes out the disgruntled neighbour who squealed to Polo about where he lived.The film ends as we see Flint talking to a medical specialist about an important operation for his wife and as Brazil lights a candle in a church for a dead friend and leaves.<br />Both Brazil and Flint are characters that are fleshed out very nicely,and as a result two people we can easily identify with.Flint`s life as a hired gun,was totally shattered since the day he,and especially his wife was attacked and she was put into a permanent bed ridden state;and his face and mannerisms show it.He lives day to day in a protective mode;a loving husband dutifully looking after his partner.Brazil on the other hand is a hired gun like Flint,but the years of killing and torment show in his well worn face.He is a methodical man as we see when he first comes home and straightens little items up in his apartment as he goes through it.He has no personal life and is very much the loner.With these characters fleshed out as they are and expanded on wonderfully by Van Damme and Rudin,there is no where to go but up.The two,though similar are very different,but they blend together well when the rubber hits the road.Polo,played with great menace and panache by Ivan Kaye,is also a welcome protagonist for the two along with the Interpol chief.To give the movie an even better dynamic the entire movie was filmed in a filtered or sepia-like colour tone.Nice.<br />Technically speaking the movie looks clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include the trailer,previews and some deleted scenes.<br />Another nice vehicle for Van Damme who has Scott Rudin along for the ride this time, and who comes up to the challenge with extra to spare.The entire cast is as solid as the writing/plot.Recommended.lighted at the thought of

Everything is controlled and decided for you, to make your life the best for you and everyone else in your community.. but, is it really the best?    This was so interesting and emotional for me, I will definetly be reading the next two!
B000001ESF|5|Rush has for nearly four decades comprised great albums with solid sound, great lyrics, and enough to keep their many fans always anticipating their next album. With this said, I can still easily say that this is their best work...a progressive masterpiece. Though many agrue if this is indeed a concept album, I'd have to say yes. True the entire album doesn't fit one story, but I think the 20+ minute title track does enough to consider it a concept album. Regaurdless on whether or not it's a concept album, the album is just flat out unbelievable and is played on my cd player nearly more than any other album. If you don't own this or have not even heard it (God help you), go get this album right away. You won't be disappointed.

0446572993|1|Though an entertaining read, it was preposterous. It would help if there was one iota of plausability, believability or remote reality to the plot. There is a cottage industry of books/movies focusing on  the lone hero against an omniscient, all powerful and corrupt renegade element of the American intelligence community. Obviously it sells. Reading any fact-based books about the CIA, FBI -like those written by Tim Weiner-show the truth. Usually the spooks are the gang that couldn't shoot straight.<br /><br />Though a fun read, I was usually going, \\"yeah right\\".
B0006B2A42|4|This is a 5 star for a 1968 movie and a 4 star our present time and technology.<br /><br />I was 13 years old when I saw ICE STATION ZEBRA in a movie theatre back in 1968. At that time and like any other kid I expected a submarine war action movie; in return it was a half submarine picture and a half spy story which, at that time, I hardly understood; yet I was fascinated by it.<br /><br />I watched this movie again and I am not surprised that this movie fascinated me years back.<br /><br />The submarine footage on and below the surface is excellent; the dialogue and the plot including the acting and the visual effects are way better that any other 35 year old movie I have seen.<br /><br />In general this is a great movie to watch or own. Well recommended.
B00B2166BS|5|Charges quickly, attaches and detaches easily from Nexus.  Sturdy materials.  Have used it for over a month with no problems.
B00005JMFO|5|I have never written a review on Amazon... or anywhere else for that matter, but this film compelled me to do just that.<br />Whilst I can appreciate that it will not be everyone in the world's favourite film, I can, with my hand on my heart, say it is definitely mine. There was so much emotion involved, I came out a weak, pathetic excuse for a man!<br />The all-too-widely-banded about term 'Romantic Comedy' fits this film very well, but the term itself is too over-used with lesser deserved films to warrent labelling Love Actually with it too. Unfortunately, 'Romantic Comedy' is all too often a synonym for 'wishy-washy' and 'time-filling'.<br />This film is so much more. This film had me crying with laughter at the funny bits, crying with sadness when relationships weren't working out and crying with happiness with they did.<br />In 21 years of my life, I have never cried watching a film (give or take the odd Disney movie ;-)<br />This film, for me,was perfect. Something that angers me slightly is the number of people on this site critisizing the film for having too many plots and too many characters. Come on, if you're going to see a film like that, you should be an adult - everyone I went with had the brain capacity to watch it, completely understand it and thoroughly enjoy it for being an intelligent film. The number of plots was fantastically easy to understand (more so than a majority of films I've seen in the last few years) which is testament to the ability of Richard Curtis.<br />I also think that Americans are at a slight disadvantage when watching this film - there are so many hidden, inside, English jokes in this film it is unreal. Another reason is because so many of the actors on the film aren't really known to American people (unless they've watched The Office or Teachers etc.). English people between 19 to 35 would find this an incredibly funny, intelligent and heart-warming film - and a refreshing change to the habitual 'Romantic Comedies' out there.<br />Highlights for me where Martine McCucheon meeting Hugh Grant for the first time and swearing - by accident; the acting ability of the step-son; and the simple 'Ant or Dec' line, which literally had me on the floor laughing.<br />It makes you want to grab the person you're with when you leave the cinema - or better still - find the one you fancy, and tell them how much you like them. Because, after all, Christmas is a time for telling the truth...

0446528056|5|This novel continues Sparks' undoubted ability to pull at the reader's heart-strings.

B00CHIMG6Y|4|Supposedly a true story -- and anything was possible under those horrific circumstances -- but it's really stretches one's credulity.  But it was very well-told, excellent acting, especially by the oldest son and definitely worth watching.
B000SZK41M|5|Still holds up. &#34;Now I have a machine gun. HO-HO-HO.&#34; Never gets old. FAR superior to the last two &#34;films&#34; in the series.
B00009P1O2|5|The newest (2003) release of this show on DVD is extremely well done. The picture quality is a bit pixelated and grainy. Considering it came from an analog tape source that is nearly 20 years old it is still quite good. The sound quality is excellent even by today's standards. They have done a superb job remastering the sound. If you were going to see them in a large arena today this is probably how they would really sound.  <br /> <br />They advertise this is the complete concert, though I was not anywhere near London in 1986 to go to the show so I can't verify that. Most rock bands I have seen perform a bit over two hours so it sounds about right.  <br /> <br />The bonus disc is really neat. It shows footage of the other concert done the night before they taped the main one on the first disc, in pouring rain. Also very good interviews with still living band members and multi-angle goodies.  <br /> <br />The performance of \\"Under Pressure\\" is stellar, as are \\"Tear It Up\\" and \\"In the Lap of the Gods\\" which Brian May remarks on disc two as being their favorite tune to play live. Freddy's vocals on \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" are so pure it just gives you chills to listen to it. Other reviews say his voice is not quite up to par in this show but I have to disagree, Freddy is clearly having no vocal issues that I can see.  <br /> <br />I became a Queen fan watching all of my other rock idols perform their songs at the 1992 Freddy Mercury Tribute Concert, which I am sad to say I am old enough to remember watching aired live on MTV, back when they actually played music all the time. Also worth checking out on DVD. I saw Def Leppard cover \\"Now I'm Here\\" and that was it, I was addicted to Queen and started getting their albums.  <br /> <br />Overall this DVD is a rare gem that's well worth the price, I highly recommend to any fan.  <br />
B00B52F278|5|Along with the Walking Dead, this was my favorite series. As much as I loved Andy Whitfield (God bless him and his family), I must say Liam McIntyre was equally outstanding and perhaps even more. It is a bit like comparing your favorite James Bond -- Sean Connery or Roger Moore. All are outstanding and render their own interpretations. I am a PhD in European Military History and approve of this series in the way that they rendered history. We all could have small quibbles about this and that, that the Romans always threw pila (special spears) before closing, that Onamaeus was really a Gaul, not a black man...but what a character he was anyway. The cause of liberty should embrace all human kind and the scriptwriters were courageous and inclusive in making this point. Crixus and Gannicus did exist, the former as a Gaul and the latter as a Celt. Since nothing more is known about them, the scriptwriters were open to their interpretations. Of the three primary accounts about Spartacus, two say he died on the battlefield, and one says the body was never found. This series took the latter interpretation and thereby provided a beautiful ending. The final season seemed a bit compressed compared to the season right before it, but the producers had decided to wind the series down. Another two seasons clearly could have been done. I personally found the acting, the characters (without exception) and the scriptwriters to be outstanding. Some reviewers have commented about the gay characters and scenes. I am a definitely \\"straight\\" Independent Conservative and did not like the first series scenes between Barca and Pietro mostly because I did not like them as men. Agron and Nasir were different because I liked them as men. As an ex-military officer, I would have been proud to stand beside them in battle and share their table. Agron's farewell to Spartacus was particularly moving and apt. The final episode was sensationally moving. I am proud to say that it moved me to tears several times and caused me to scream into the picture and pray to God to be able to help them. Who among us does not understand that there is good and evil and that the cause of brotherhood and liberty are worth dying for?
B002BSHXJA|5|Despite having always loved The Beatles, I have waited till now to purchase the complete Beatles catelog. And I am glad I have waited. This is a great collection (although I had to purchase the 3 Stereo albums seperately).  2 of the albums include both the Mono & '65/'66 Stereo versions which is great for comparison.  Excellent quality of reproduced album covers and booklet which gives some detail on the recordings.
B00IYOACQ6|5|I liked this game
B00ATDOVNK|4|I had a good time with this game.  The graphics were good and it took some thought and concentration to get where you needed to go.  The map feature helped a lot!
B00IUBXPEY|1|Sorry I spent money on it. The first movie was incredible.. I struggled through &#34;Catching Fire&#34; and threw it in the garbage when it was done. Major disappointment.
B000XUBFE2|5|I was skeptical at the first chapter of this book. I thought it would be an odd stream of consciousness work but I was wrong. What follows that first chapter is the engrossing tale of a young girl trapped in a world at war. It showcases true love and sacrifice. The book will challenge you to consider your own moral limitations and champion the human spirit. The narrative is lengthy and if you are looking for a feel good novel, keep searching. However, for a book that is true to its time period and resonates with you after you have read it, this book is deserving of your time.
B0050DIWFC|5|This is a really good book.  It gives the reader an excellent idea of what parents will do for their children.  It  was spellbinding and the end was a real surprise,
B004D2A04M|5|this is a great flashlight belt clip, I have a large Fenix flashlight and it fits great in this belt clip. It is built strong, I am sure that it will last a long time of daily use.
B00992CF6W|5|I just cant stop playing
B000002KET|5|Bought this cd to continue my replacing of the old vinyl catalog.  Still sounds great after nearly 40 years.<br /><br />Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  !!!!
B00000DHRZ|5|offspring is the best cd I ever had.IT'S not like any other bands.3-5 are my favorite songs.If you like punk this is the cd for you.<br />                            ps,offspring rocks
B00000J7J4|4|Reading all of the various reviews I get the feeling that most people feel that while this is certainly a good album, it is definitely not his best. Carlos Santana's best work is certainly behind him. Abraxsas is the album  that should have won him all of the Grammy's; however, it is only now that  society will allow black or hispanic artists to recieve the credit they  desereve. Nonetheless, Supernatural gives audiences of today something to  remember this great artist by.
B00G4BYEQA|5|The Lego Friends kits are fun projects to do with my 6-year-old daughter.  She loves the Lego Friends series on Netflix and these toys are almost an exact match for the sets in the movies.  The instruction books are very clear.  They show, in pictures, how many of each part you need and where they go (although sometimes the color of the part is a little vague).  They only have you add a few parts in each step.  I mostly built the first couple of sets, but have gradually been having her do more and more of the work.  We just completed the Rehearsal Stage and she put almost all the parts together herself while I helped her interpret the directions.  She has made a lot of progress developing the dexterity to align the Legos and snap them together tightly.  These kits stay together amazingly well.
630587493X|5|I have had this movie for some time.. Something for the whole family to watch. Some of Robin's best work I think.
B001QWBM62|4|Pretty solid sound quality for the price.  The built in mics are very useful, and the variety of input and recording options are great.  Sound has a slight tin-quality, but probably only noticeable to audiophiles and pros.  The only real downside at this price point is the menu system - it's not entirely intuitive, however, once you are familiar with it, the options for in device use are pretty robust.
B00F91SCXC|4|It was an edge of your seat movie. I don't remember having any problems with it.  Would recommend it to others.
B007XAYKX8|5|The skills of these riders is simply amazing.  I watched this with a friend who was ambivalent about motorcycle racing.  He is now a fan.  Valentino Rossi, Jorge Lorenzo et al are very intelligent and describe their viewpoints very well considering English is not their first language (I hope).  The camera angles from various places on the bikes themselves makes for great fun.  If you like any kind of motorsports, you will enjoy this movie.  I own and have previously owned many sport bikes.  I thought that I was doing fairly well with them.  I now realize that I ride like a 90 year old in Florida compared to these athletes.
B000X2H8G4|5|This little amplifier is a godsend. Wellmade and sturdy and considering how small it is amazing. Guess it's true that good things do come in small sizes. I put it next to my tv speaker and had the sound almost turned off and it picked it up with no problem and no distortion. My only complaint is the headphone that comes with it only has a 3 foot cord which was too short to reach my bed. I have another set of earphones that are longer and the problem was solved as the headphone jack for this unit is universal. Can't beat it for the price! I love shopping thru Amazon! They have everything at prices that are hard to beat. Great job!
B0058VW36U|5|This has been one of my all time favorite games for a mobile device. Do yourself a favor and get this well-made game.
B001TKD4ZI|5|The storyline grabs you right from the start and takes you on a whirlwind ride right to the end. I hope there's more to come!
B00BJ9VBLI|5|lots of fun. starts out easy and gets tougher as you progress. Have stayed up late many a night to play &quot;one more level&quot;.
B000HWXO4U|3|I have long given up that pop stars will include all their videos in one set. As the case here, See You and The Meaning Of Love never appeared in any Depeche Mode collection. So I'll have to thank YouTube for filling the void!  Depeche Mode is fond of using plants and flowers on their covers for Exciter and Violator. However, the content here is far from the pure white rose pictured. Many videos have disturbing and/or adult themes, so you might want to keep it from minors.  The general themes of construction, cars, isolation in big places, temptresses and whorehouses are pretty consistent throughout.   Personal Jesus shows the group visiting a whorehouse in the middle of a big lonely desert. In I Feel You, a temptress saunters in and poses seductively next to a statue of a religious figure to juxtapose sin and religion. Rather distubing like their song Blasphemous Rumours. Barrel Of  A Gun sees Dave Gahan doing a spot of automatic writing while possessed. Suffer Well has him walking pass a place with the signage HELL SUFFER WELL and then coming to a shop with Martin Gore dressed as a bride. It's all so subtle.  When you watch the videos in succession, it is easy to see the change in directors. Everything Counts, People Are People and Master And Servant by Clive Richardson are kind of similar, using machinery and construction to match the music. Then videos seven to 17 are helmed by Anton Corbijn, who's fond of using grainy shots of the vast desert. There are also two versions of Enjoy The Silence.  So yes, The Best Of Volume 1 is incomplete but on the whole it is still a decent set with enough rock and roll themes to freak out conservatives. Just don't air this during family gatherings.
B00006ZXSK|5|my fav movie of all times.  just beat out oz
B0015ABRE2|5|I highly recommend this series, this is the 3rd season, MUST WATCH THE FIRST TWO. Not for kids or individuals that find adult themed shows offensive.
B009LK6JS2|5|I like this app, it is a great game to play when I am on my break time at work. I fortunately got the app when it was a featured free from the amazon store, but would have gladly paid $2 for it. It takes some time to learn, and I would strongly suggest doing the tutorials and free flight modes first so that you can get the hang of it, but even after that there will be times where you end up as a fireball at the end of the runway. Don't let that discourage you though, you will feel rewarded when you make that landing. My advice is to be patient, since fuel is not an issue, if you pass the runway you can just turn aruond and try again. () I Love the game, it is the most used app I have on my tablet, and I hope there are more games like this one in the future.<br /><br />Update: I just traded my little tablet in for a new one and re-downloaded this game. Now it's even better because now included is an A-6, and the option to buy the AV-8 (bummer you have to buy it). Also included is a mid-air refuel mission, and it is challanging as heck. I would like to see the inclusion of a sea hawk helicopter and an osprey in the future.<br /><br />This issue has also been resolved in the latest edition (Thank you for listening):<br />My only problem with the game is the F-14 Tomcat, the wings switch is right next to the landing gear switch, so when you are playing on something smaller then a 7\\" tablet, such as a smart phone, 4.3\\" tablet, Ipod, etc. you will have a hard time getting your gear down or bringing in your wings unless you use a stylus, this could be easily fixed in an update by putting the wings switch in another location.
B0019IB0II|5|An excellent book about how our brain works. Besides, Her experience is nothing short of an amazing example of Will Power!
B00PJ5AUCO|5|Hey Scott, I love your FNAF games. This one is way better than the first one. I just have one question...when is the 3rd game coming out?
B00EV4EUT8|5|I thought the actors were outstanding. They played their roles as if they had lived the experience.  It appeared to be an historical fiction. Much  like today, the young people take a different slant on what is the best route to take in defending their right to be free from their parent's generation.
B00992CF6W|5|The best game I have ever played. It is so much fun. I always play with my sister. We have a great time.
6301963911|1|Annie Hall is Allen's attempt to be Groucho Marx.  If you need a witt fix watch A Night At The Opera or Duck Soup!!  This is the single worst movie I have ever purchased.
B000O8OTNC|5|I bought this after hearing it was a small, quick sharpener w/ the advantage of the diamond flip out for serrated blades-this option works well.  On plain edge knives I've found it sharpens them quickly using the carbide and ceramic sections, though not quite razor sharp. The diamond edge used as is on a plain blade, or the removable carbide and ceramic, could of course be used to obtain a much sharper edge if needed
0307454541|5|Great book to read.  You can't put it down until you find out what happens to the characters.  The story is addicting and throws you through so many loops which keeps you guessing until the end.
B00LZXOI5E|3|Good game, but after playing for an hour I became bored.
B00T3DNKIE|3|Interesting story but no page-turner and too much flashback to the original Mockingbird.
B0020BUWX2|5|I enjoyed the ways in which life, death, and that in between is presented in this novel. I enjoyed the style in which the book was presented and the every-other-chapter flashbacks were appreciated. The book began in the present setting and a family drive, moves to the he struggle of a young woman in a coma experiencing an out of body experience, and delivers back story through cleverly placed flashbacks that are presented thematically rather than in order. This book was a very though provoking read and very emotional. Be prepared to have a box of tissue.
141694737X|5|I received this book.<br /><br />My granddaughter likes to lift the flaps and see the animals/<br /><br />Thank You!
B0012RCMH4|3|this typical album is heavy and ok--but,dont waste yor money on this 2 cd set!!!the songs are not very melodical,and nothing is special--only true fans of hellhammer should buy!
B0000B1OFL|3|Decent without ever losing its stride and becoming good or better. The plot was good, but underwritten to many things happened that left questions. The first being... they didn't steal that much money to enable the thief to survive for so long and still have money to spare when they stole it back. What was it? Like fifteen million or so? Alot, but a far cry from the money heisted in Oceans Eleven or Heist.<br /><br />This is basically just an entertaining film,  you don't have to think about the plot, just sit there and let the movie while<br /><br />away the hours. If you like decent cars and ok acting than this is a movie for you, otherwise....
B00IJJUIMY|5|Connelly continues to be at the top of his game, and so is Harry Bosch. The addition of Harry's new, young partner is a very smart move at this point in Bosch's career. O.K., the crossing plots are a bit of a stretch but we'll accept this because of Connelly's adept storytelling. The very end was a bit of a surprise but after thinking about it, everything seems more comfortable than not and again we ask what's next for Harry Bosch.
B00HVJB4VM|2|Interesting perspective but some what unbalanced.
B009U9S6FI|4|I found Viktor's story of his time in concentration camps to be equal parts fascinating and gruesome. His insights into the meaning of one's life should be required reading for all human beings.
B00QWTPCII|5|Killer instinct is all killer, no filler. Every tune rocks.
B007ZGO7EM|5|love this app. amazing how much I have used this since I started working on my kindle. I'm a service professional and this calculator is used every day on my kindle.
B0032UYFA6|5|Great, Great, and more Great!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5|Love to read well-written work, and Mr. King provides that for me- and you! Only drawback is it makes most other writers pale by comparison.
B00IRISI42|5|Was not disappointed with book and enjoyed reading during my travels.
B007V2UGPE|1|crashes and loses everything.  tired of losing everything.  died on kindle fire repeatedly.  why wont they fix it or refund money
B00C7DGQ9C|4|Fabulously beautiful women. Hero and heroine kickin' bloody arse left and right. Scarey witches. Romance. And an adoptable troll! Perfection! I was sick over the weekend and watched this perfection 6 times. Gemma can throw a punch!
B00CW6DAKC|4|This app is really fun, but after a while, it erased everything on my game. I was only on level 15! Now I have to start all over again! :(
0345803485|5|Love This Book.....
B00E8KLWB4|4|Really addictive love it!
B000002LR3|4|Screamadelica is the album that set the pace for quality blends of hardcore rock and basement dance in the years to come.  It hasn't dated at all, in fact, it sounds more relevant now than it did upon release.  A  drug-influenced album (obviously) that rarely falters and is surprisingly  coherent in its madness, taking chances with a variety of styles. Best  Tracks: &quot;Loaded,&quot; &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Movin' On  Up,&quot; &quot;Slip Inside This House&quot; Rating: 8/10
B003UBTX6S|4|Loving this series. This 2nd book reads a tad slower and its hard to see Lela going down a dark and depressing path...I'm not finished with this book but with good versus evil theme...I'm rooting for a happier ending
B00HZX0IM0|5|Excellent collaboration between a couple of rock 'n' roll veterans who sound both fresh and comfortably familiar, at the same time.
B001O03NCW|5|you're serious? you are looking at reviews?
B00005QGAV|5|This is a great CD. Love all the songs on it.  Wish I could find a CD with his song Butterflies besides Invinceable.
B007EW9ISM|4|This is the &#34;pen&#34; for making sure that your marks are noticed.  Not only that, but it also shows that you are appreciated for having the knowledge to have such a versatile tool before it was absolutely needed.
B000CCD0HQ|5|For those who (like myself) were disappointed/outraged by the remixing that was done to this fine album when the box set was released some years ago, all is now well. This is the original mix in all it's basic and straight-on splendor. This is the album that \\"made\\" ZZ Top, and rightfully so. With classics like \\"Waiting For The Bus\\", \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\", \\"Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers\\", \\"La Grange\\" - hell, the entire album, if you buy only one ZZ TOp album, this is the one to get. If you only know the MTV-era ZZ Top, then this will show you what they were really about before they descended into self-parody. This is raw and real.
B000V1Z8KK|5|this is one of the best movies ive ever seen.  keeps you guessing throughout the entire movie. great action, good acting, always guessing what is going to happen next. highly recommeded.
B00ECU34ZM|4|Cool visuals but story line a bit hard to follow..
B004FRX0MY|5|Great way to have and listen to your favorite playlist
B000H6FHLY|5|Adorable....great seller also.  This product by Schleich is always high quality.
0307455920|5|As seen on The Bookish Owl (http://www.thebookishowl.net/?p=7015)<br /><br />It was a long time before I mustered up the courage to pick up Americanah as I was still reeling from the sheer beauty and power of Purple Hibiscus, the first Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie book that I read. When I finally finished devouring Americanah last night, I was struck by how speechless and awestruck it left me. It wasn’t merely up to par with Purple Hibiscus – it exceeded it, going far and beyond. The last book that made me feel this way – this abstract feeling which I can never ever verbalize – was Markus Zusak’s The Book Thief.<br /><br />The magic of Americanah stems from its various themes, all equally provocative and colorful. To ask, “what exactly is Americanah about?” is to do the book injustice for it encompasses so many things. It is about race, racial identity, cultural identity, a country’s identity, and yes, love, among others. To be honest, I couldn’t relate with some of these ideas: specifically, those that pertain to being black, whether being “black” refers to being African-American or a Non-American Black. This theme was lost on me, obviously because of my race, inexperience, and isolation from the issue. Nevertheless, I thought that this theme and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s execution of it resonates and continues to apply to the issues that we face today. Or, to be more accurate, the issues that I hear and read about on the news.<br /><br />Concepts that I did appreciate, however, were those that spoke of Westernization, national and cultural identity and how these two relate to our own sense of self. The two principal characters of Americanah, Ifemelu and Obinze, both move abroad from Nigeria to work and in Ifemelu’s case, to study. She moves to America and he to England, two different people in two vastly different countries but with roughly the same experiences. Poverty, exploitation, homesickness, and their status as illegal aliens hanging over their heads. It wasn’t hard to imagine that these too were felt by the thousands of Filipinos working overseas.<br /><br />Then there was the matter of cultural identity; the clash between Nigerian culture and Western culture, most profoundly felt by Ifemelu herself. This conflict was reminiscent of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart (mentioned in Americanah, by the way) which tackles the same thing albeit under different circumstances and in a whole other century. Ifemelu’s struggles to remain true to her roots despite the pressures and the need to be Westernized as well as her difficulties in reverting and adapting on her return home was excellently written and translated on the page. Ifemelu wasn’t just a character – she felt like a real, breathing, existing person and it was easy to empathize with her.<br /><br />Obinze’s chapters in the present as well as Ifemelu’s perspective on her return home from the USA gave a glimpse on how Westernized their country had become. Thanks to Ifemelu, the “old” Nigeria and the “new” Nigeria were blatantly juxtaposed. It was interesting to see this contrast but to see Ifemelu struggle to adapt in the new Nigeria and to witness the change in her friends, all who were introduced early on, was even more fascinating.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me about Americanah, however, was the ending. It felt too abrupt and too rushed. Nonetheless, I felt it an apt and fitting conclusion to Ifemelu and Obinze’s story.<br /><br />In A Nutshell:<br /><br />There’s a lot more that I want to say about Americanah but I’m struggling to find the right words to express my thoughts. One thing’s for sure; Americanah was sublime. It’s one of the best books that I’ve ever read and along with The Book Thief, one of the only books that I will enthusiastically, ceaselessly, and highly recommend to everyone.over their heads.

B005RUUUAI|3|I think Season 2 wasn't quite as good as Season 1 was. I don't think it was as action packed as Season 1 and one episode in particular seemed to have a repeating scene in it, which I found a little odd. Hopefully Season 3 will bring back more of the action!
B003Q6D2B4|5|Happy birthday dad! You love this movie.
B009JZSC9S|4|Still very good. But, the plots are getting a little too convoluted for my taste.
0385504225|5|Received the book in expected, good condition and quickly. Will buy from seller again. As far as the book goes, it's the Dan Brown formula where the end of each chapter is a cliffhanger. I stay up later than Ishould because I can't put it down.
B00NFQSW1U|5|Kids go crazy for CA
B005V20JKI|1|the movement speed is WAY to fast. appllication locked up on install and had to force close again when trying to exit
B000002MTR|5|The majority of Chili's fans tend to overlook OHM, choosing to focus on the two big albums before and after it. However OHM can't be compared to those two because the Chili's are experimenting with a new direction, led by Navaro, and the result is an absolutely incredible album, full of strong music. The album isn't as commericial as the new one, therefore it didn't achieve the same success, but it is a masterpiece in it's own right, full of songs that are a lot more skillfull and thoughtful than the tracks on Californication. Only a shallow fool could possibly think this album wasn't as good as the others, I have no doubt that this alternative style (which is unique to this album) is actually the best sound the Chili's ever produced. They never should have let Navaro leave.
B00DQR26EC|5|This game is amazing. I love the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously, if you like humor you will love this game.
B000065V42|5|This movie has a cartoon proceeding it.  Actually, the part of the film that is not suitable for children happens to be the cartoon (Roger Rabbit).<br /><br />This was an excellent science fiction story.  It was thrilling, and well written.  There was one scene early in the movie that was forgotten, until a later scene, and then it sent chills down my spine knowing what was next.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie.
B00HGJ18C2|4|The game itself is great, but the ads get progressively larger until they are full page.
B00EL8I8IS|5|👍
B00DR0PDNE|5|perfect
B0089LOG02|5|I enjoyed reading this book. I was not aware of the history of the orphan trains. This brought it to life.
B00B99KJR0|4|Interesting and well thought out.  Challenging and a a good time waster.  It has a different take on the usual match-3 games with its story line and implementation. If you like these kinds of games, give this one a try. Graphics are okay.  There could be more animations. Overall, very good and I recommend it.
B00EXTQV70|2|Oh my, this book enticed me to keep reading in the hope of something meaningful might happen. It just never did. The end was flatter than a pancake.
B00N57VBRG|5|A fun family game with hints of Mario thrown in. Simple, yet challenging at times.  Highly recommended.
B00GQQ77IU|5|this is a awesome movie. i had no idea what this movie was about but when i saw the preview i said i want to see that. and i was not disapointed. i did not know it was based on a book. now after seenig the movie i want to read the book. the acting was great, the story was great and the special effects were good. this is a good movie can't wait to see insurgent. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00A9ET4MC|5|This was the best book I have read in years; reading it made me eager for tomorrow, eager to turn the next page. I found the characters to have so much depth, when I finished the book, I felt bereft, like I had left good friends. I hope the film adaptation does them justice.    Some reviewers have called the text \\"narcissistic,\\" but I found the author's voice to be humorous, perceptive, and insightful. Seeing America and, perhaps more importantly, seeing Black America from the eyes of an outsider made me rethink my overly used words and phrases like \\"great!\\" and \\"rich culture.\\"  I am still gathering my thoughts to write my goodreads review of the text, from which I have read passages to my students. Ifemelu's conversations and blogs about race were provocative, compelling, and real. They were actual conversations that I, as a Black American, have had with friends, colleagues, and family members, conversations had in the sacred walls of my liberal arts college, internal monologues I've silently thought as the sole Black American in my private graduate program.    Americanah inspires introspection as we continue to face our tomorrows.

B004SDSSFY|5|This is a great product, however using on an Asus without the assistance of a mouse, I found it quite awkward and time consuming. I'm used to the full blown MS Professional on a PC so there is a learning curve. Some of the excel features weren't available and I rely HEAVILY on excel functionality. For basic run of the mill excel use I'm sure it will suit your needs. I gave up on the Asus as well as the excel docs to go

0440237688|4|This book was great for a few reasons...<br /><br />Theme - a utopian society will always be relevant and always be thought provoking. Especially when its well written like The Giver is. I find the theme to be incredibly interesting, especially since I have only ever read one other similar novel which was 1984.<br /><br />Size and syle - It was short, very easy to read and follow. The thing I liked about it is that even though its technically a young adult novel, it can be read by all ages.<br /><br />The characters were interesting. The plot was fast paced and engaging.<br /><br />Overall, its a must read for all ages.
B00BAXFECK|4|I LOVED this book till about 2/3 done with it.  The author is very descriptive but in a good way.  Puts you right there.  The boy fascinated me due to the loss of his dear mother.  It all of a sudden got too weird with his Russian friend and I did not enjoy that part.
B006E4QCXU|5|Daughter and I love to play it when we're bored.

0751532711|1|I agree with another reviewer who said his favorite part of the book was the first two chapters. Sums it up for me. The rest of the book repeats the mantra - don't indulge in buying material goods - furniture, cars, etc. (guns/butter theory) Save your money. Invest in things that will pay you. Make money work for you; don't work for money.<br /><br />Certainly a lot of wisdom there, however, it's pretty basic.<br /><br />I was troubled by the author's attitude towards the average worker. Somewhat condescending. The author's dad [poor dad] was a college professor. The *second dad* [rich dad] was a neighbor who had invested in real estate and businesses and took young Robert under his wing. Rich dad pointed out different folks in his employ and told Robert \\"you don't want to be like them.\\"<br /><br />And why is that? Because they didn't have the vision to invest? Because they weren't rich? Because they were working in service work? Wow. Kind of harsh.<br /><br />One gets the impression the investor dad [rich dad] worked constantly. A real workaholic. Is that the model we should aspire to? This book uses money as the measure of success. I have a problem with that.<br /><br />College professor dad [poor dad] and others like him who work 9-5 jobs and struggle to support their families were regarded as parents of a lesser ability or lesser vision.<br /><br />The counter-argument might be, well, Robert retired at 47 years of age. I don't know about Robert, but I *do* know about my own life's experience. I am 47, and one of the worst decisions of my life was investing in real estate when I was 22-years-old. My little girls spent too much of their spare time, working alongside mommy and daddy in a crummy apartment building, scrubbing the toilets, cleaning the floors and trying to coerce money from the hands of deadbeat tenants, so we could forward it to the mortgage companies. And then we lost all our money in the late 1980s when Tax Reform of 1986 hit the investment real estate market. However, we did get out of those apartments and lived a blissfully ordinary life for many years. Listening to the children laugh and giggle in the backyard is one of the great memories of my life and had *nothing* to do with making money.<br /><br />Whilst reading this book, the mercenary side of my self rose up again and I found myself getting swept away with the dream of being wildly rich. I had to stop and ask myself \\"What are my goals in life? Where do I want to spend my time? Invest my energies?\\"<br /><br />I remember something my dear father-in-law told me years ago. He worked two and three jobs the whole time his kids were growing up, so he could invest and live comfortably at retirement. He said \\"If I had it to do over, I'd have enjoyed the kids more and worried about the money less.\\"e apartments and lived a blissfully ordinary life for many years.

B00WP9HSJU|5|Anyone who has planned a trip to Prince Edward Island hoping to meet Anne (with an e), or taken their child into the tube station looking for half a platform knows a reader's wistful longing to meet a much loved character.  Or at least stand where they once stood. Finding Fraser is a tribute both to Diana Gabaldon's creation.. but to that secret desire of every reader to find themselves, someday, between the covers with their favorite character.
B00005JMK0|5|Well... Like a friend of mine said once: I'm speachless... I set myself on a search to buy this film on DVD, it's one of the best movies I saw in my teen years: brings back all the memories I have on some of my favourite things, romance, love, hope.... Well, I could go on and on... <br />Please, release it on DVD!...

B0000DCGT5|3|One of the things the producers behind 'American Pie 2' were proud of was that most of the cast (and all of the major players) of the first movie returned. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Oz (Chris Klein), which was an integral part of the group in the first two movies, isn't even mentioned in 'American Wedding'. An actor's absemce (whether it's due to his unwillingness to rejoin the franchise or any other reason) is understandable. And since Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) had so little to do, Oz's absence was a blessing in a way. But a mention of him and his whereabouts would have made much more sense than completely erasing him from the American Pie 'mythology', hoping we (the viewers) won't notice.<br />While Finch &amp; Kevin fade into the background, Stifler (Seann William Scott) gets a much bigger part than ever before. He's still an obnoxious girl chaser, who didn't seem to outgrow his highschool juvenile - jock personna, up until the end of the movie.<br />Besides the big change in the group dynamics, this movie (unlike 'Pie 2') takes a big turn story wise. Jim, Michelle, and their wedding are now the center of the movie, instead of the group's friendship &amp; dynamics. We don't get to see the 'stories' of Kevin or Finch, for instance, develop any further, or hear a word about their current relationships (besides the inevitable encounter with Stifler's Mom).<br />The laughs, though, are still there. They still are, or course, immature and pretty coarse, but by now, this is wat is expected of the 'American Pie' series.
B005OT2YVA|4|I have watched all of the transformers movies thus far and I think the special effects are awesome.  Great movie for a lazy day.
B00008EY63|3|This was a thin concept that never made enough use of its star - Ron Pereleman.  An indestructible demon brought to Earth by Nazis during WWII (which overlapped with the \\"Occult Wars\\"), Hellboy was found by American soldiers and raised by a kindly professor (John Hurt) to fight evil.  Though he can clear tall buildings in a single bound and utter no more than \\"oh, crap\\", Perelman brings out a decidedly human side to the character.  HB has been working for our side - specifically the kind of super-secret organization that exists only in comic books or movie adaptations of them.  We first meet HB through the eyes of John Meyers - a young transfer from the FBI, who finds that his new job involves following HB around and making sure to have plenty of candy bars around for the right moment.  Though HB seems to have things under control, two problems nag him.  The first is his unrequited love for Liz (Selma Blair) an emotionally scarred fire-starter (she doesn't like the word \\"pyrokinetic\\").  His larger problems involve plans to complete the world-destroying plot that began with HB's arrival on Earth.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, mostly because Perlman brings surprising earnestness to his role of demon who likes kittens and can't get the girl.  The best thing about comic books is that they work as great ensemble pieces (a team of heroes, or a solitary hero working against a great villain).  Unfortunately, the script gives HB little support.  Rupert Evans as Myers can do little more than follow HB around, and keep him supplied with mounds of pancakes and gallons of chili, and there aren't enough scenes between Perlman and Blair or with his Hurt.  There's a scene midway in which Jeffrey Tambor, HB's reluctant boss, reminds him that theirs is a team effort - yet much of their back-up is anonymous.  Even the villain is generic - the kind of old-world sounding occult dude we had enough of in \\"Underworld\\".  The basic plot riffs on Lovecraft, but so did \\"Ghostbusters\\" 20 years ago.  In the end, HB becomes little more than Perlman v. CGI, a match that underrates the talents of both Perlman and his character.  HB is still nothing if not satisfying, though you never get past the sense it could have been so much more.tbusters\\" 20 years ago.  In the end, HB becomes little more than Perlman v.

B00003CXDD|4|I originally saw this movie when I was in 9th. grade. It is still one of my favorite movies of all time. I even read the sequel novels by George Lucas and Chris Claremont and it just brought back so many memories of when  I saw it in the theater. I just hope it comes out in VHS soon, because I  don't have a DVD player.
B00IJJUIMY|5|sad that its over already ... Need to wait for the next one!<br /><br />Hopefully there will be another one coming soon ...

B004LOMB2Q|5|I used to carry multiple composition books around for all different things but this allows me to keep all my journals in one place. It is universal for Mac, PC, and Android. You can look up your stuff anywhere.
B00GH738GS|2|Good action, but the scenario does not hold together. Why would Elysium shoot down illegal shuttles trying to reach it at the beginning but no longer in the middle of the movie?
B00007JMCX|4|A thin, pale, androgynous David Bowie is THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH -- Special Edition (Anchor Bay), a two-disc set of Nicolas Roeg's film.<br />Previously available on DVD, this widescreen (enhanced for 16x9 TVs) edition looks sharper, the clean DTS surround sound is THX approved and there's a new, interesting 24 minute featurette, &quot;Watching the Alien.&quot;<br />Slow moving and beautifully photographed, this movie adaptation is faithful in theme to Walter Tevis's novel. An alien being, disguised as a human, comes to earth to seek a way to save his home planet from turning into an arid wasteland.  He funds this project by designing inventions worth gazillions and becomes bigger than Bill Gates. Unfortunately, he also becomes contaminated by our earthly ways and sinks into a mystical malaise of depression and alcohol. A sweet and chirpy Candy Clark lures him into an affair that, strangely, doesn't help.<br />This hypnotic and provocative film long ago achieved cult status.  More than anything, it's a visual meditation about an outsider, stymied by material success, who is on a journey back to a home that cannot in fact be reached.  (Hey, who can't relate to that?)<br />Fully restored and uncensored (there's full frontal nudity), this new digital transfer is from original materials. Recommended.
B007GCY8FS|4|I have read all the Reacher books but 1 presently and this particularly book seemed to have a lot of controversy.  Some readers think that Lee Child was slipping when he wrote this. I personally liked this story a lot.  I agree that there is not a lot of action packed pages until the end and not a single head butt in the whole book.  The plot is very good and I like to think that Reacher is a complex man with many sides to him, not just a grunt that smashes heads and kills bad guys.
B005ETANC2|4|I remember when I was a kid watching this now classic  movie.  Great special effects for the times. I liked it.
B000001ESP|5|Bought this for my 7-year old grandson. He's an amazing drummer and Rush is his favorite band. He asked for this CD for his birthday.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|I haven't leveled up that much yet but so far it has taken no time at all to level up. I like that this game has different ways to get keys which are an item you really do need at some points and this game starts you off with plenty.
B00B99KJR0|5|I was lucky enough to snag this as a free app and I'm so glad I did. I've been hooked ever since! Great game, storyline, graphics, etc! Definitely give this game a go you won't regret it!
1594200440|4|Perhaps I'm just nuts, but to me this wonderful little tale is not about family relations or sex among the elderly. No...this is a modern day interpretation of the mythological Greek goddess Demeter, who ruled the harvest and taught man to reap and store grain. Demeter is, of course, Ludmilla, the now deceased mother who causes everything to grow and be fruitful. She even goes to Hades (a punishment in a wartime work camp) with her daughter just as Demeter rescued her daughter Prosephene from the Underworld. Our Demeter is married to technology, an uneasy union, that. Her husband goes berzerk if he is not being guided and controlled. There's a fake Demeter, Valentina, who looks sexy and fertile but nurtures nothing. She doesn't want a union with real technology either. She wants a stove of the right color and a trendy vacuum cleaner that can't be used. Not to mention the useless cars she picks. Inserted throughout are pieces of the history of the tractor, the perfect marriage of agriculture and technology, that parallel or illuminate what's happening in our little modern-day family. The author, in fact, even winks at the reader by giving an off-stage character the name of Prosephene.The moral of the story can be left to the readers of this clever parable. I thought it was quite wonderful.
B00FF8OKJE|3|Bored. This game is good for in between games.
B001BKTEZA|5|75 years later, this book should still be required reading for all.  Unlike a dry history text, the compelling narrative tells the story of the Joad family, but it also tells the story of a very painful chapter of US history.  For me, it also resonated with many recent events here in the US.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This was a great series and I read the whole series in a week. Very enjoyable and different from my previous reads.
B00DRPVE3M|5|I love it but hate running out of playing tokens only if they gave you some for winning uno games
B00CE3IC74|4|I have been using these for a few months now.  They are sturdy with a strong-enough adhesive to stay where you put them.  Do NOT put them on metal though.<br />I would give them a 5 except I've had to reprogram a couple after one-month's use.  No biggee, but it cost them a star.  They work very nicely with our Samsung Galaxy S4s.<br />I recommend these to all who need inexpensive NFC tags.
B00B7FXYJG|5|gritty and well written
B00IG2DOKM|5|I love playing this game. It's great that it is always updating and adding new stuff.
B00JNQMKT6|5|Really good ---especially since the movie was made , it's easy to imagine Ben Afleck as the lead character.
B008F5YDRI|4|Somewhat light but enjoyable movie. Good characters that you like, so you get involved in the story. I recommend it as entertaining.
B0085Z8F4A|4|(SPOILERS Ahead) \\"Prometheus\\" is quite an entertaining movie with stunning visuals but has a plot that will leave you stumped if you are not paying attention or do not think things through. The acting is quite entertaining. The movie, while not specifically a prequel of the \\"Alien\\" movie, definitely has elements that clearly tie it in to that movie. If you go into \\"Prometheus\\" expecting to have everything laid out for you, you will be sorely disappointed; this is not \\"Transformers\\" - expect to have to take the information given and cogitate. For example, one character, after arriving at the planet and exploring the \\"mound\\", becomes quite drunk and morose. Well, you have to realize that his dream of actually meeting one of the aliens had been dashed - what was to be his greatest achievement of his life had just been utterly destroyed. How would you respond if your dreams were dashed to pieces? Another example is David's poisoning of the aforementioned drunk. You have to listen to the conversation that occurred between them: \\"What would you do to realize your dream?\\" \\"Anything and everything\\" \\"Exactly\\" (or sentiments to that effect). Couple that with David's objectives and it becomes quite clear why he did what he did.<br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, turn to \\"Transformers\\" and other movies of that ilk. This is not one of those movies. Both \\"Transformers\\" and \\"Prometheus\\" are good movies, but for very, very different reasons. If you are looking for a movie that will make you think, and has stunning visuals to boot, this quite easily could be a movie up your alley.
B007SYWFRM|1|My 9yr old racked up $130 bill playing Ice Age.  Not very clear that the \\"acorns\\" cost real money.  Not fair.  I'm sick now.
B00HCOSF3G|5|Plain and simple the best song of the year!  If this song doesn't make you feel good then you must be dead!  Everytime I hear this song it just makes me want to dance and sing!
0793563836|5|This book has only one flaw, but other than that, it is perfect.  It starts you off learning how to sight-read from the very beginning, so that if you have any discipline at all, you can finish book 3 an accomplished bass player capable of creating your own bass line and reading sheet music and chord charts, and not another guitar center hang-out hack who looks up popular song tabs and can only play those 5 songs.  The progression is very nice, you are given enough exercises for each idea that you can integrate it before moving to the next step, although repeating the previous couple chapters every day you before you go to the next is good. I sometimes go back to book one and play the whole thing through, then book 2, focusing on improving my timing and sound on even the simplest tracks. It's never ending.  The flaw I mention is the lack of ear training. This book will take you to the intermediate level for sight reading and you'll learn most of the fretboard and even some theory and how to create bass lines towards the end, but you'll have to look elsewhere to learn about interval recognition and 'playing by ear'.    If anyone knows a good ear-training book please let me know btw.
B00NM7K7NI|3|Interesting story but the lighting sucked and was hard to see
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Really love the show.  I enjoy watching it.  Especially watching granny.  Wonderful actors, love the characters.  I look forward to watching more of this series.
B003M6EAXM|5|Started the latest and realized I had never seen the series.  Decided to watch all to catch up.  I was spellbound.  Really enjoy them!

B00555X8OA|4|A little boring at times with the experiments detailed similarly in each chapter, this book plainly will help you understand your thinking and decision-making better. If you've read Nudge, you simply must read this book as it explains the nuts and bolts.

B00JOT3HQ2|5|Fun and very addictive and its FREE!!! The three best things in one game!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4|I resisted this game for a long time as something too frivolous to be worthwhile. Then a friend convinced me to try it, and after downloading, I couldn't quit, especially when my friend said she always tries to score three stars. After a few weeks of near compulsive play, I finally quit cold turkey. I will probably start playing after I retire in about a month.
B002IR3PQ4|5|I love this band! Freddie Mercury is amazing! He had an amazing voice! I just love all of their songs on this album. My favorite song is Somebody to Love. Queen still plays on the radio, and I just love their music! Freddie Mercury will always in our hearts forever.
0374532281|5|Both the book and movie are absolutely great!  I think the movie is a but more fun and happy, but that does not take anything away from the novel!
B00CW6DAKC|5|I get up and go to bed playing this game. I like to see what surprise I get everyday. so I try not to miss a day.  but how do you gain the green dollars faster.
B005KJJ4F8|5|This book is amazing and that is my opinion!<br />It will give you an idea of the surprise in the end!
B000W7JWUA|5|This game is awesome! Recommended by two co-workers independently. Game lives up to the recommendation. Complex enough to be fun for adults, not too complicated for my 9 year old. He was able to completely grasp the concepts and game play after one practice game. Nice online resources, best new game I have played in a decade.
B002FVRA5U|4|Great read
B00406UK5A|4|This was actually a pretty good movie. I wanted to rent it first but all the copies were out so I took a chance and just bought it. I kind of expected that I'd regret spending the money on it but within the first fifteen minutes I was convinced I'd made the right decision. It's too bad I didn't see this movie in the theaters, although I don't recall it ever even going to the theaters. If it was a direct to dvd release then that's truly a shame it would have looked very cool on the big screen.
B001H4NXCK|5|I bought this on DVD.  I already had it on VHS.  It was hilarious.  My favorite scene was the stage coach ride.  Mel Gibson was a laugh a minute.  There were a lot of great actors.  Mel Gibson, Jody Foster, James Garner ect, ect.. You need to buy this.  No bad language and anyone can watch this.
B002NT3B52|4|Fun read
B0000AZJXQ|5|the drum beats that you hear throughout the album keep you wanting more and more.  I bought this cd wondering if i would hear a song better than weak and powerless, and i think there are 3-4 songs better......BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!
B00CWY76CC|5|Enjoyed the levels that were there.  Nice graphics and play.  Good job.  Difficulty level is nice and makes for challenging yet fun game play.
B005ZUR724|5|this is an amazing game pretty much the second best mmorpg (in my opinion) it is just like world of warcraft except smaller and conveniently on a portable device its worth the money especially since WoW is 60$ plus monthly payment.... this is 7$ andno monthly payment. thank you for this game
0345803485|5|awesome book, very cheap got it in a timley fashion didn't have to wait long would recommend buying books from hehrefor those that like to read
B00A6CCF0K|5|So fulfilling that Danny finds peace....Master at work! Absolutely loved this story. Stephen King is the best at character development.
B008PZ69T8|5|I had already purchased a few of the songs on iTunes but had to have this album because I was so intrigued and entranced by the music. It was not a disappointment at all.
B00CW6DAKC|5|I love to play this when I'm waiting for Farmville 2 Country Escape crops to finish. Adorable graphics and just as fun to play! Also love that it's on the water. Add me please FBQABXT I need neighbor's badly.
B009SJ3H8Q|5|Great story lines if you like like twisted, scary horror scenarios. What else would you expect from the producers of Nip/Tuck?
B00AHXDECG|5|I absolutely LOVE Bruno Mars voice! This album is full of fun and sexy songs. Many different types of songs too.

The future of life on earth looks bleak unless we change our ways!
B001M5UDGS|1|Despite the fact that I love Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion and the direction of Joss Whedon, this is the lamest, most boring movie I've ever seen.  What were they thinking?  Certainly, in my opinion, NOT worth the money.
B002MQYOFW|5|Enjoyed the book.  Kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.  I would recommend it to the teenage set and older.
B00NH13W2W|5|Working great!
B0042X9L6A|5|Now I know why I could never take beautiful portrait pictures before, even with my beloved Nikon D3100 DSLR camera.  I was using the pop up flash and even if the exposure was correct, the pictures just never looked &#34;real&#34;--there was always something flat about them.  I bought a better camera, I bought a 50 mm portrait lens, I took photography classes, but I didn't have an external flash.  With this speedlight flash, bouncing light off a white ceiling, I took pictures that give the faces depth and they look &#34;real&#34;.  No more washed out, flat portraits, gosh even I look good in these photos.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out how to get the best pictures (some of mine were a bit overexposed but I'm hoping to fix that in the editing phase), but some of my pictures actually look like a professional took them.  This flash is what I have been missing all my picture-taking life and it was well worth the expense.
B00MRHANNI|5|loved it
B00CH3DBNQ|5|A wonderful and inspiring story This book and Malala's story are are truly inspiring and reminds me to be thankful for the education I've received.
B005GVA2L0|1|Yep, Evanescence went mainstream with this one. It's a shame since their original sound was beautiful and unique in a world of auto tune.<br />Maybe it's just the synthesizer that is never turned off throughout the entire disc that is to blame. Without the synthesizer perhaps some of the beauty of the singing, lyrics, and guitar/drums would be able to make it's way through.<br />I was very disapointed because the previews of the tracks sounded wonderful, but now I can tell that they were timed to cut off right before the dreaded synthesizer kicked in. Wonderfully deceptive of whoever did that, because you sure rickrolled me.
B00280LYIC|5|When I started reading this, I wasn't sure what to think of it, but by the time I was half way through, I loved it!  The second I was finished, it became my favorite book, and I had to read the rest of the books in the series!
B000TGJ8CQ|4|What would you do if you could see into your immediate future?<br /><br />This is a concept movie that actually works very well on a number of levels. Admittedly, the ending can be feel like a cop out to many viewers, but it actually is very much in keeping with the general theme of the movie. Accept it for what it is and it's really not that bad an ending.<br /><br />Cage is, as always, very laid back in his portrayal, but that works very well for him. His magician persona works best when he gives no tell of what he is planning or what he has seen in the future.<br /><br />To put this in proper context, this movie is inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick, who wrote the stories that spawned \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", \\"Paycheck\\" and \\"Minority Report\\".
B00CL68QVQ|4|This is a movie that I had no idea what it was about, but I kept hearing about it. My sister and her husband took a rare night out to see it. A good friend shared his appreciation of Jennifer Lawrence. So yeah, I rented it on Amazon, with pretty much zero idea of the plot. So a Philadelphia guy has his mental problems, and gets out of the looney bin after almost killing his wife's lover, and moves back in with Mom & Dad. Dad is a relapsed bookie played by Robert de Niro. Dad becomes needy as he wants Pat (Bradley Cooper) around to watch the Eagles games with him; he believes Pat gives him good luck. Mutual friends introduce Pat to Tiffany (Lawrence), another nutcase. There is immediate attraction, but Pat is still obsessed with his wife. Tiffany persuades Pat to enter a dance concert with her. Love is sublimated, until the end. You can guess. Yep, tears in spite of yourself. Well done.

B000B7BRMM|5|Diana Krall sings the classics, she does not try like others to write a new classic Christmas song and it's fine like that. She delivers great versions of all the songs and gives us one of the best Christmas albums in the recent years by a major artist.<br /><br />She gives all the songs freshness although they are half a century old or maybe more and she sings them the way they are supposed to be sung with the jazz mood.<br /><br />Christmas is a special time of the year and it's great when a fine artist like Diana Krall brings all the songs back to their original form. It sounds fresh and new although we know all of them by heart.
B000WQ9UA8|5|Right out of the gate this album is on FIRE!  This is cutting edge pop, there is no doubt about it.  If Britney needed something to get back on track, this is IT.  The negative publicity that Britney has received for some time now will have to contend with this monster of an album.  I have a feeling that as long as she stays out of trouble, this strong album will do the talking and be loved by the massive wealth of pop fans on the planet.  Britney, it's time for your comeback!
B00KRHWZ22|4|Some fine insights, good organization of history, a pretty methodical look, but the book itself is pretty short, and half the ebook is essentially others' postings to Bob Cringely’s blog. Most of the book seems to be taken from his blog, which isn’t surprising but will yield a lot of repetition for regular readers. If you aren't a regular follower of Bob Cringely, this book is a real eye opener.

B00AW28HF6|4|The first few words - 'Etched sidewinder snake tracks ...' painted a vivid desert scene, drawing me into the story. An espionage thriller, it's full of spies, secret agents and their conflicting agendas. The plot criss-crossed the globe, but at the start of each chapter it is defined where and when the action is taking place. Warning: Adults only - Contains explicit sexual content. A lot of information is imparted (reminded me of Tom Clancy). Massive potential for this story to be made into an action-packed movie. In my mind I casted Angela Jolie/ Scarlet Johanson as Kefira and Colin Farrell as Zak. The story ended with a satisfying teaser for the next installment. This book was gifted to me by the author for an honest review and the opinions expressed here are my own.
B000005JA8|1|I feel ripped off like I did with the Beyonce album.  thought that this albumn isn't very good.you'd be better off not buying.he has a too high pitched voice that will drive you insane after a while.<br />THIS ALBUMIS GARBAGE<br />I DIDNT LIKE IT ONE BITE<br />I THOUGHT IT HORRIBLE<br />I Can't Understand How People Can Listen To This [...]. He Can't Rap And His Beats Stink. If You Want To Hear Some Good Rapping And Beats Get Any Of The Lil Jon And The EastSide Boys Cd's There are many many more artists who actually work harder and sing better then artists such as Captain Beefheart and get nothing. He basically uses his looks to sell records.<br />Why has this album taken the world by storm? It's nothing but safe hip-hop that doesn't address any issues or offer any depth. I'm not saying that every song has to mean something, but come on, this is just shallow and stupid.There are tons of things that an artist like Beefheart could put out there. How about a song that encourages young people to vote and take an interest in the world around them? How about a song about how life is still difficult for a successful white male artist?<br /><br />WOMEN fall for Beefhearts tricks, but anyone with eyes and ears should know that Beefheart is faking it!  can't believe people like this crap. Beefheart is the most annoying, money hungry [...] of the century. All of his songs sound almost identical, and his voice is so whinny and irritating. I would never waste my precious dollars on his memoriobilia, or his albums for that matter. Beefheart, someday you will be forgotten just like those other losers before you, so enjoy what you have now because it can only last so long.<br />what has the music industry wroght on themselves???? They only have themselves to blame....way too much R & B, Hip Hop crap on the airwaves...way too much. I await its fade into the sunset like the Diso era, Folk era, and Techno pop era. I await the return of great lyrics by master song writers, songs that use good grammer,poetry, and proper English! The more The Powers That Be annoit as \\"genious\\" midiocre talent, the more I stay away from CD purchasing and radio listening.<br />this guy for some reason which i cant understand<br />is a influence on the younger generation<br />as far as music goes...feeling,lyrics,sound<br />are to words which are too deep for him.<br />he his not in tune with just the basics<br /><br />very very bad album<br /><br />This album is just horrendous.If i had 2 choose listening 2 this album again or taking a shot of acid,id take the shot of acid.This album would make a midget wanna commit suicide,...absolutely horrible. Overall, if you likeBeefheat, you should either be below the age of 12 or you just don't know anything about music. If you want proper avant garde music look at Gary Barlow, or Gary Glitter<br /><br />You are not Gary Barlow and you never will be. I hate Beefhearrt as well, and I wish he would stop polluting the charts with his tuneless crap. His singing sucks, the beats are overused and annoying. Just to emphasize once again Beefheart you are jealous of all the attention Gary Balow gets. You are not as hot as he is, Captain Beefheart cant write songs,cant sing, cant dance etc. He cant do ANYTHING! untalented wannabe<br />Bad songs, bad album. Don't waste your time and money on this.

B008AK8FHM|5|I loved the book!  After reading several accounts of NDE, Dr. Eben's account of his experience confirmed my thoughts on the issue.  I have read all of the Elizabeth Kubler- Ross books on 'Death & Dying' yet 'Proof of Heaven' gave much more incite on the real experience.  I feel that at some point I may re-read Proof of Heaven because the first read was so engrossing, that I read it very fast  .A second read will possibly give me a deeper incite.  If Dr. Eben's account is true, it serves to take away some fear of the unknown after death.
B000FCKC4C|5|This book was recommended by my 20 year old grandson. The book was well written for a first book by a writer. It was deep and made me think and question some things. I really enjoyed this book and will probably reread it at sometime.

0307702103|1|I have read and loved every John Grisham book (prior to now). This is my first Grisham audiobook.  And although I listen to a multitude of audiobooks, I could  not finish this one.  I got through 3 of the stories but could not do another one.  I can't understand how so many of the reviewers gave him higher rankings.  (Most of the non-amazon reviews on the internet all average 1 star.)  Mr. Grisham's reads this book like he is at a first grade reading level with the limited inflections all in the wrong places. He makes it difficult to realize whether he is at the end of a sentence or not because he reads as if there is a period after every word.  I cannot believe the publishers let him proceed with reading this work himself.  Please, Mr. Grisham, stick to writing (which you are great at) and let someone else do the vocals... Thanks
B000058983|5|Of all of the L.A. bands of the mid to late 60's, Love was the one band that most perfectly blended the hazy hippie rock with the darker underbelly of L.A.; nowhere is this dichotomy more brutally apparent than on the band's 3rd lp, &quot;Forever Changes.&quot;<br />Jim Morrison said on more than one occasion that Love was the band he wanted the Doors to be. While this notion was admirable, Morrison et al never even remotely approached what Love was- the perfect mix of the late Bryan MacLean's moving long songs (the gorgeously lush &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; and his look at not only love, but respect between elders and youth in the tearjearker &quot;Old Man&quot;) with the harrowing look of life through the eyes of Arthur Lee.<br />From the opening chords of MacLean's &quot;Alone Again Or,&quot; the album is special. As he always did, MacLean is able to convey the whimsy of the hippie era through his lyrics. The wonderful use of spanish style guitar adds to the beauty of the song. MacLean was the master of love songs, and he scores a bulls eye here.<br />From here,(save the haunting &quot;Old Man&quot;) founder and leader Arthur Lee's incresasingly disoriented (yet also amazingly perceptive and eerily prophetic) world view takes front and center. &quot;A House is Not a Motel&quot; takes on people's lust for violence, while the horrifying &quot;Red Telephone&quot; takes on paranoia, and is easily the most disturbing song in Love's canon. &quot;Andmoreagain&quot; can be seen as an updated version of the Beatles &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; in all honesty. The sentiments are more or less the same. The Hendrix based &quot;Bummer in the Summer&quot; is also a harrowing piece of amazing work.<br />The brilliance of Lee and MacLean come front and center on this essential re-issue from Rhino records, who continue to bring on the goods from the 60's. No collection can be complete without it; It is the last great moment of late 60's L.A. rock. Amazing.
B000P6PVLC|4|Seen it in the theatre ..and loved it ...as part of a non serial of movies by Latino directors ...<br />That are friends of course...and it seems that they are in competition with each other<br />The audience is the winner....period!
B00QW8TYWO|4|This is a highly-addictive and yet a challenging game app on the Kindle Fire HD.  Very similar in concept to the Frogger but I think this has more traps to make the player fail.  Simple yet good graphics and it responds fairly well to user inputs.  Satisfied with it.
B005ELZKWS|4|Instead of hitting the dreaded sophomore slump, Chickenfoot decided to go ahead and name their 2nd album III.  As with the first album Chickenfoot III is exactly what you would expect from a band that features Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Chad Smith and Mike Anthony.  No holds barred classic party rock with the occasional more serious lyric thrown in for good measure.  Hagar's voice is still amazing at his advanced age and Satriani can still shred with the best of them.  Mike Anthony's background vocals along with Satriani's pyrotechnics make many of these tracks sound very similar to Hagar era Van Halen.  Overall I think the songwriting on this one is quite a bit better than their debut.  Highlights include, \\"Up Next\\", \\"Three And A Half Letters\\", \\"Big Foot\\", and \\"Dubai Blues\\".  Some of Sammy's lyrics are actually rather cleaver, and thought a bit beyond his his usual good time Hagar party songs.  If you liked the first album I would think you would like this one.  If you did not like the first one, you might want to give this a chance as it is a rather significant improvement.

0446677450|5|I don't care how much money you have now -- rich or poor, you need to read this book.<br /><br />There's a commercial on TV right now with a guy telling us all about the wonderful things he has -- a beautiful car, a beautiful home, a country club membership, etc. -- and at the end he says, \\"How do I do it? I'm in debt up to my eyeballs!\\" Then he begs for someone to help him.<br /><br />I see it everywhere -- people just like that guy. I know, I was one of them too. Trying to 'blow-the-doors-off the Joneses' is no way to live. Robert does a great job of making that clear for us.<br /><br />We can get rid of all that stress in life, and still live enriching, wonderful -- even affluent -- lifestyles, but so long as we are responsible and so long as we follow the advice of Robert Kiyosaki.<br /><br />RDPD is a classic. Take my word for it. You will enjoy it. But more so, you will get out of it far more than what you pay for it.

Never once did I find the film to be  confusing, dumb, or overreaching.  The only people who don't understand  films like these are the people with short attention spans and whose  favorite film is Independence Day...This film is very well crafted and  made, especially in the last few moments.  If you follow it, you won't be  disappointed in the end.

B005ZUR724|4|this game is like WOW but a heck of a lot cheeper. it responds great on the kindle and looks great to! if u like action and rpg's or mmorpg's then get this game. Update \\"1/1/12\\" allot of people who bought the game for the past week could not play it. But they could not play it because they needed and update but game loft did not put one out right away. but this is an mmo on a phone it is not a pc so it is not instantaneous, they have to put the update on then amazon has to approve it. So the game works fine people just need to calm down and relax. Works wonderful now, just chill out. Also the updated went up during Christmas when game loft was most likely closed. So give them a break lol.
1402545355|5|All of Mr. McCall Smith's books that I have listened to work well in the audio format.  Actually, they are BETTER this way than reading the books. I understand that is a strong statement. And having listened to many of them, I can attest to this. Here is why:<br /><br />Narrator--Lisette Lescat is nothing less than superb. In an unabridged format, you get every word the author wrote, delivered in a melodious voice that conveys many shades of meaning that the words have.<br /><br />Format: listening really helps you get the dialogue down better. And dialogue is one of the key strengths of these books.  Storytelling verbally is the oldest form of communication. These books will make you smile, laugh, and think, as you listen.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to hear the author at a recent book signing. He told us that he does have input into  who reads the books for audio, and with one exception, has enjoyed the books very much when spoken.

B008Y6U5AM|2|It was strange and often made no sense.
B00HVNZHZW|3|After seeing the trailer, cast list, and critic reviews for American Hustle, I forked out the money to see it on the big screen. This film may be worthy of a nominee for the acting, costumes, or the like, but as a whole, the film was a disappointment. The storyline was nothing that fully drew me in nor connected me to the characters. Certainly a movie worth watching as a rental simply to enjoy the superb acting, but not worth buying.
B00B0LPWU6|3|The first 7 mins are exciting, but the rest of the movie is a depressing alcoholic struggle- no action or suspense.

B0041KKYCY|2|Only two movies ever made me feel like taking a shower after watching them because they were so raunchy. The first one was \\"Watchmen\\" the second one is this POS.<br /><br />Although I never have seen the original of I spit on your grave I think that makes it better because I can freely judge this movie. For the most part the first half of the movie just plays out like some late night porno. A girl walks around wearing a skimpy outfit gets hit on (what else is new?). She goes to a cabin alone to do what I don't know play with her laptop while drinking wine I guess. Apparently she's supposed to be a writer? Yeah I buy that. So writer girl prances around half dressed and sometimes in her underwear. She gets the attention of some locals and the obvious rape happens. I guess that's why I didn't like the film so much.<br /><br />Since this focuses on the rape so much it seems \\"FORCED\\" to say the least. I don't get the sense that the girl is being raped. I don't get to feel her trauma or her pain. I have no connection to her character. It's as though it's thrown in there to get it out the way. \\"Last House on the Left\\" had a better rape story. You got to know the victim and you felt a connection seeing her pain as she got raped. You wanted to see revenge for what they did to her. If your movie is going to be about a woman getting revenge at least build her character up so that we care about the revenge part. This was just like a dark porno (if they even make those) and a so so one at that. You actually feel that she did worse to the rapist than they did to her. Just because they developed her character so poorly.<br /><br />All I know is that the girl is from the city,dresses like a slut, smokes marijuana, and drinks A LOT of wine. That's all you get to learn about your character. How am I supposed to even care what happens to her? She might as well as be an extra in the background.<br /><br />Long story short this movie seriously lacks a decent plot. Pick this up if you like watching a girl get revenge on men in a way that would make Jigsaw smile.<br /><br />2Stars best part is the T&A from the main character that saved this from being a Lone star rating.on men in a way that would make Jigsaw smile.    2Stars best part is the T&A from the main character that saved this from being a Lone star rating.
B000089RVX|4|the best thing to come out the average movie daredevil was the stunning soundtrack...but most of all the track  &quot;Bring me to life&quot; and the introduction to the group Evanescence. &quot; Bring me to life&quot; is a haunting song.

B00005CDNJ|5|One of ABBA's best loved orginal albums, \\"Super Trouper\\" entered the UK album charts at #1 and spawned three major hit singles.<br /><br />There's not much I can say about this album that ABBA fans don't already know. All the songs offered are exquisite supertunes sung masterfully by Agnetha and Frida and there really is not one bad song in the bunch. Bjorn's lyrics have matured and some of these songs are lyrically very poetic and beautiful. Frida impresses with \\"Our Last Summer\\", \\"Andante Andante\\" and the title track and Agnetha shows the world that she is more than just eye-candy. Her vocals are superb on \\"Happy New Year\\", \\"Lay All Your Love on Me\\" and my favorite ABBA song, \\"The Winner Takes It All.\\" Their voices are strong, unique and very dramatic and the vocal harmonies are perfection. Just listen to the chorus of \\"Super Trouper\\", \\"Our Last Summer\\", and \\"The Piper\\" (another favorite) as examples. Other album highlight are \\"The Way Old Friend's Do\\" which was recorded live at Wembley, the latin-esque \\"Put on your White Sombrero\\" (bonus track) where Frida takes the lead (and the song really comes alive at the third verse, when Agnetha and Frida sing, full out, in harmony) and the very mysterious \\"Elaine\\" (another bonus track) which has interesting lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Super Trouper\\" (the album) was an international best seller. As mentioned previously, the album debuted at number 1 in the UK and became ABBA's sixth consecutive Top Ten album in Canada where it peaked at #4 and it reached the US Top 20. The biggest single to emerge from the album was \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" which became the group's 8th #1 in the UK. In North America, the single reached the top ten in Canada and the US. The single also became ABBA's second US #1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Charts (\\"Fernando\\" was their first). Another UK #1 was \\"Super Trouper\\" which was a minor US hit (#45) but it should be noted that that single along with \\"On and On and On\\" (US #90) became ABBA's 17th and 18th single to reach the Billboard Hot 100 in 7 years.<br /><br />What amazes me about many of ABBA's albums is how they managed to create so many great songs. I guess there is a reason why the group is still popular 23 years after their break-up and why they continue to sell several million records every year. This album is a testament to their talents as recording artists. In my opinion, they are the greatest pop group ever and extremely under-rated and credits must be given to the 2 female lead singers, Frida and Agnetha, whose gorgeous vocals contributed to the intoxicating sound on these records.18th single to reach the Billboard Hot 100 in 7 years.<br /><br />What amazes me about many of ABBA's albums is how they managed to create so many great songs.

B00003CXB7|5|Robert Altman's \\"M*A*S*H\\" is certainly an anti-war film in that it's set in an army hospital near the frontlines of Korea, and features battered bodies and at least once, a geyser of blood from a severed artery.  Its main characters, Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John McIntyre (Elliott Gould), find themselves patching together the battered remains of what were once young soldiers.<BR><br />But in between marathon sessions in the OR, Hawkeye and Trapper John wage their own witty war against incompetence, confomity, hypocrisy and overbearing authority.  They carouse, drink and mercilessly bully anyone who gets in their way.  Their first target is Maj. Frank Burns (a memorable performance by Robert Duvall), an overly religious and self-righteous man given to blaming others for his mistakes.  Hawk and Trap set their sights on him and never let up, and, like its protagonists, \\"M*A*S*H\\" proceeds to take no prisoners.<BR><br />There's no plot in the classic sense.  Things happen, the wounded come in waves, and our doctor heroes proceed to mock anything and everything that comes their way.  Sutherland and Gould are an amazingly funny team, quoting old movies and dropping into strange characterizations to meet every new challenge, be it recalcitrant regular Army nurse \\"Hot Lips\\" O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), befuddled CO Col. Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), or a football-crazy general (G. Bowen).<BR><br />Among their schemes:  faking a suicide to give a friend back his self-confidence, blackmailing an officer to save a sick child, and bringing in a ringer to win the football game that makes up the movie's uproarious climax.  In between, we get to meet such memorable characters as \\"Radar\\" O'Reilly (Gary Burgoff), the almost-psychic corporal, \\"Painless Pole,\\" (John Schuck) the \\"best equipped dentist in the Army,\\" and Lt. \\"Dish\\" (Jo Ann Pflug).  Plus Swamp-mate Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt) and the ineffectual but well-meaning Father Mulchahy (Rene Auberjonois).<BR><br />Altman packs the movie with dense, overlapping dialogue.  The result is chaotic, frenzied and hilarious.  Hollywood would never dare make a movie like this today, in which traditional values are so thoroughly and hilariously trounced; \\"M*A*S*H\\" is a truly dangerous and subversive film.  Its doctors (and \\"M*A*SH\\" itself, by extension) love only honesty, intelligence, freedom... and very dry mar-tin-eyes.  With olives!  Plus, the occasional nurse.<br /><br />Finally, this classic has the treatment it deserves.  This \\"Five Star Collection\\" release (on two disks) contains a gorgeous widescreen version of the movie, Altman's commentary, the \\"Backstory\\" documentary, two other docus, and a restoration demo.  A brilliant film in an excellent package.
B00HUCF420|5|Epic. Dark. Amazing. Disturbing. So very satisfying. Couldn't stop once we started! Both Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson do a fantastic job and they are absolutely mesmerizing to watch. The story builds and builds over the 8-episode season, ending in an epic way that left us breathless. It is a psychological drama, a mystery, a buddy show - all kinds of things in one. Definitely not for the faint of heart (very dark and creepy) but it was so gripping that I could set that aside to see how it was all going to play out. HIGHLY recommended!
B00B2TUKI0|3|I expected a unique take on old favorites from Madeleine Peyroux, but I have to say this CD simply doesn't measure up to her earlier ones.  The musical arrangements on several of the selections felt awkward.  I can applaud the &#34;blues&#34; concept ... but the final product is not, I think, a good reflection of her creativity and one-of-a-kind voice.  I will continue to enjoy her earlier CDs and look forward to the next &#34;new&#34; one.
B008G8SFGO|2|Less groove songs, not as much swagger.  Expected a heavier record.  Simpler pop songs, with a retro 70's feel to it.  I am long time fan, but I confess to not understanding this one too much.  But hey, I could be wrong.
B00AB7HESI|4|The thing that's great is being able to do anything and really able to explore your imagination
B0035O66BU|4|A good film for when you're not in the mood for war, murder, or deep drama.  It has just the right balance of pathos and humor.  It is not a musical, but reminded me of &#34;The Music Man&#34;.

B00HGJ18C2|5|This app is just what it says, Solitaire, plain and simple - just like the real card game.  Easy to use.  No FX, no distractions, just you, your brain and the cards - exactly how I like it.  If you enjoy playing Solitaire, then this app is for you!
B0056XME46|5|This was the authentic Apple product. It does what it supposed to do, and it is what it claims to be.
B000ELJBAA|4|Released in 1984 at a controversial time for Pink Floyd and produced by Bob Ezrin, this is David Gilmour's 2nd solo album. The guitar work is brilliant as always and David's voice and lyrics are quite in good shape too. While I wouldn't rate it as high as 'David Gilmour' or 'On An Island' it still manages to capture my interest and I do revisit it from time to time.  This remastered edition does improve upon the previous one, the music sounds stronger and the instruments are clearer for sure. The booklet provides all lyrics and there are quite a few pics of David during this time. I'm glad to have replaced the version I had for this one.
0810993139|4|My eleven year old son handed me this book. I hugged him afterward. With few modifications I think this book could have been about MY youth. Several times I had to stop reading so I could  laugh out loud.
B004GYY714|5|All you need is a wi-fi connection and this app... music from everywhere is instantly in your advice. Highly recommended.
B004YRSBTW|4|Events unfold completely out of order.  However, there are enough evidence left to connect all the parts together.  Great movie
031606792X|5|I absolutely loved Breaking Dawn and thought it was a beautiful end to Bella and Edward's story.  I can't wait until the release of Midnight Sun...it will be incredibly interesting and gratifying to read Edward's side of the story.  I hope Stephenie ignores all the negative reviews of Breaking Dawn and continues with the Twilight saga...either with Nessie and Jacob's story or some of the other characters.  Of course, I wouldn't mind another Bella and Edward series, either!
B000HKW7E0|5|One of the funniest holiday movies ever!  Enjoy it again and again.
B005K0HDGE|5|I am not usually a King fan but I found this book to be a fun ride and hard to put down. It makes we aware of how my everyday actions affect all around me.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Absolutely loved all her books, her characters are endearing that I've grown attached . I watched the Outlander series and had to read all the books.<br /><br />So sad I've finished her last book.
B00006F83Y|1|I tried and tried and tried. No matter how many times i listened to this I thought it sounded like a drunk singing!! the songs were boring, not catchy and down right droll!! Only good song is the one m-tv is beating to death. There is way better new bands out there than this, if yea like light new rock, try the Donnas!
B00005JKGZ|5|St. Louis at the turn of the century---the one before the last one---with all the childhood traditions from that era just add to the mix of a rich movie musical especially befitting Christmas holiday viewing.  Judy Garland's rendition of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" starts the tears flowing.
B00BSBR9N6|4|I enjoyed reading the plot written through the eyes of an Aspergers young professor.<br />Somewhat similar to the book &#34;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&#34;<br />by Mark Haddon.
B00KNOXB7M|5|Great movie!  The winter soldier was dark, but misunderstood just like a vilan should be. Black widow was a total bad ass and Chris Evans as Captain America was very charming.  The introduction of the falcon was a nice addition too. It made captain America seem less robotic with the falcon around.
B008Y7N7JW|5|Great Movie  with eye-opening concept, fast moving and not just for teens. Acting was great and visually pleasing. Better than I thought it would be.
0446547573|5|but there was really no ending&#62; That was unfortunate and the only problem I had really. Must be a reason
B000JQU4TW|5|I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised.  I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it.  It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.<br /><br />It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty.  He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\".  Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter.  Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal.  Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.<br /><br />People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.<br /><br />In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)
B00B1RB942|5|Well,<br /><br />I am kinda impressed by this movie. Lovely characters, animation, story, and one of the best animes I ever seen. It is a mix of action (in both, the real and virtual worlds), comedy and social criticism.<br /><br />Imagine a world, where the Internet evolved. At first it was a platform for chatting, then it grew into many other directions, so right now the Internet is your second home. Every device is connected online, GPS navigation systems, the entire infrastructure, everything. You can't even use a phone without connect to this platform and register account / login to existing one. Everything is connected and works only if connected. What if something happens inside this system? This is also the main point here.<br /><br />Well, however you may have a feeling of deja vu, if you ever have seen the movie called &#34;Digimon - The Movie&#34;. But I seriously like &#34;Summer Wars&#34; more.
159420411X|5|This is brilliant - it's a challenging read - we humans want to think that every cause and effect has a linear operation when the reality is that almost everything is much more complex. Most commentators trust in linearity to make their projections which is why most are wrong and some just get lucky. I have handed out six copies to clients and peers with the suggestion that this book will change your views for ever - he explains how Chaos Theory came about and just that example shows that what we want to see as explainable is far from simple or fully explainable. It does require time to read, I read about 10 to 20 pages at a time as I had to reread these many times to get the accurate insight. You will never be the same again - if you do not see your transition in how you process facts then you need to read it again.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Guys watched  the video play it love it good hate it bad I love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it PLAY THE GAME
B0060ZJ74O|4|\\"Moneyball\\" might just be the smartest sports movie ever made.  It takes the very complicated subject of using statistics to evaluate players and makes it simple enough that anyone, baseball fan or not, can follow along.  Brad Pitt is excellent as Billy Beane, a guy obsessed with winning in small-market Oakland.  He's working with a low payroll in an era when teams like the Yankees, Red Sox and Rangers are spending huge sums of money.  After a chance meeting with Jonah Hill in Cleveland, Pitt brings Hill out to Oakland and, together, they develop a new way of looking at baseball players.  They develop a formula that puts the A's in the playoffs (though not to the World Series).  As I said in the title, \\"Moneyball\\" isn't so much about baseball as it is about thinking differently.  Pitt and Hill have to deal with a lot of doubters, many of whom are in their own organization.  Yet they persevere and show that it works.  Granted, there are challenges to their formula along the way (one of whom is named \\"Jeremy Giambi\\"), but they gradually gain more acceptance from those within and outside of the organization.  Being able to see the evolution of acceptance of this idea and to also see the results is especially gratifying, as it really makes you realize how outside-the-box thinking can make a huge difference.  There really is a lot in this movie for baseball die-hards as well.  The scouting meetings and especially the way trades are completed are fascinating to watch.  These are also where Pitt shines as a wheeler/dealer and Hill plays the naive baseball newbie perfectly.  Pitt also does an outstanding job showcasing how competitive Beane is and just how much he hates losing.  The wordless way he expresses himself when he actually sets foot into the stands during a game emotes an almost childlike wonderment at what is going on around him, almost like \\"wait, we built this?\\".  The movie does have a few slow points.  I thought the scenes with Pitt and his daughter were nice,but didn't really add anything.  And the movie does bog down occassionally in scenes where they sit in the film room and analyze tape.  A lot of the drama of the A's season is also lost, mostly since everyone knows how it ended.  But it would have been nice if they'd spent just a little more time on that part of the year.  Overall, though, this is an outstanding film.  It goes completely against type for a sports movie and makes it into almost more of a life lesson about the success you can have when you think different.
B00BD99JMW|5|couldn't put it down. it feels like what is happening in our world. we need to all wake up and try to make this a better world.
B00QLVY7J2|5|Great game, helps time fly bye.
B00TKNQQHO|4|I love this, but You're So Beautiful wasn't up there. That was my favorite song.
B00J7UL6V6|5|Haunting pink floydish first song and delivers throughout the rest, you've heard some on the radio.
B00ABA1OP4|5|Okay, obviously one has to be kind of a fanatic to buy any musical group's &#34;videos&#34;... most videos are monotonous, slapdash, and not terribly &#34;narrative&#34;. Rammstein from video one knew visual was important and used their varying physical appearances, incorporating personas to match. Some of the early vids you can see the grain, but it was the late 90s and things have progressed technically. Sound quality (on Blu-Ray) is fantastic. And I honestly did not want to open the wrapper, as the packaging for this collection is handsome as well as clever ( the &#34;we're all one&#34; credo plainly evident right up front). Anyone with impressionable kids might want to keep &#34;Pussy&#34; away from them, as it's graphic as can be without actual money shots. It's also hilarious for those of us who've watched a bad porno or several. The Jonas Aukerland stuff is funny, a bit shocking even now, and he obviously loves working with Rammstein. For those of us who have a favorite member of the band, it is especially great to see some of the hair dos and don'ts, the fashion catastrophes, and physical changes. &#34;Keine Lust&#34; addresses the eventual &#34;old rock star&#34; thing... but it was also  when Till Lindemann's health was not good, and the lyrics to the song aren't funny at all. Finally : if you are a Rammstein fan, or know someone who is, this is a sure bet. Ich liebe Rammstein. Fur immer !
B00AHG3UYA|5|Great read, quick read! I look forward to the movie to see if they do the book justice. :^)) Enjoy
B00E5I2MEK|5|This product was great and it was on time It was exactly what I expected for the price given period.
6300271439|5|For anyone who likes Madonna, this movie is the best. She is great as Niki Finn and my favorite part is when she shoots her gun in the car and yells, &quot;I am Niki Finn, I will not be denied!!!&quot; Buy this movie if you  enjoy light and clever comedy
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Such a good book.
B00003CXDZ|5|The movie Moulin Rouge was a fantastic movie starring a good-looking man, Ewan McGregor, with a voice that just made my heart melt, and Nicole Kidman, also beautiful with a great voice.  They had a chemistry that really made them seem like lovers and that showed that they are both extremely talented actors.  I highly recommend this movie for music lovers, and anyone that loves or will ever love.
B00B0LPWU6|4|Flight is a very good movie. Denzel Washington gives a great performance. His portrayal of the pilot was very true and real.
B007SGM084|4|I gave it 4 stars because I liked the story. It was entertaining, and would still have without a sexapade every other page. That was my only complaint about the story.
B0063IH60K|5|My first downloaded game.  Great for killing time in an airport.  Love the way it deals the cards.  It's fun and enjoyable.
B00B4FU6KE|5|Just loved this novel. It really made me think about the nature of what it means to be human versus animal, in fact I found myself thinking about the book for days after I finished it. It's well-written but easy to read, a great story for both serious readers and casual bibliophiles alike.
B000069HK2|5|1. Maybe Memories: 2/5-my least favorite song on the cd.  It does not seem to go at all with the rest of the cd, and more ironically it's the first track.  Ususally a skip for me.  <br />2. The Taste Of Ink: 5/5-A great choice for a first single.  Awesome beat, and memorable lyrics make this a song that you will keep on singing in your head.   <br />3. Bulimic: 5/5-Without a doubt, one of my favorite songs on the album.  Catchy chorus, original guitar part, overall great song.   <br />4. Say Days Ago: 4/5-I'm not in to the whole screaming thing from them, and that's what this song starts out like, but it gets better, but it's still not the best one on the album. <br />5. Poetic Tragedy: 5/5-Sounds a little different from everything else, but in this case it's a good thing.  The song is like a poem in itself, awesome song. <br />6. Buried Myself Alive: 4/5-Again, good choice for a single, great lyrics, but it may get a little boring if you keep listening to it over and over again.   <br />7. A Box Full Of Sharp Objects: 5/5-Fast paced, it grabs you and doesnt let go, and it sounds amazing. <br />8. Blue And Yellow: 5/5-Here's where the cd goes from fast to slow.  This is the slowest song on the cd, and one of the best by far.  Beautiful lyrics, and song, and it shows off Burt's vocal ability like no other song on the cd.  <br />9. Greener With The Scenery: 5/5-I don't know what it is about this song that I like so much, but I just love every minute of it.   <br />10. Noise And Kisses: 5/5-I gave this song a 5 because at the time of buying the cd, I could really relate it to my life, and what was going on at that point, great song. <br />11. On My Own: 4/5-Another slower song, not as good as \\"Blue and Yellow\\", but still a pretty good song, but it may get a bit boring. <br />12. Pieces Mended: 5/5-Good wrap up to a great cd.  <br />

B00CWVGBEO|3|I wanted to see how Arnold was doing now days.  Lots of action and he played off the fact that he is getting older.
B008AK8FHM|5|Dr  Eben's NDE is extremely well narrated and it is interesting to see how an academic man with such a scientific view of the world realizes that there is something bigger, greater and beyond our knowledge that is full of inconditional love. His story is pure and not biased towards any religion. Excellent page turning reading..!
B00LCT494Q|4|Sounds like a coked up engineer/producer from the ’80’s recorded it. some really good songs, but I don’t understand that tinny cocaine influenced sound at all. Not his best.
B00U6AXPOM|5|Although this is a departure from their trademark (copied by many) acoustic folk sound, overall I think this is a very impressive album. Maybe a disappointment for fans who wanted M&S to once more hit the repeat button, I think this is a much welcome and smart evolution into what can be considered mainstream rock with a much more edgy sound while still maintaining a folksy flavor. All in all one of my favorite albums of the year.
B00E8B1P9M|2|The director tried to maintain a high level of intensity, but the result is a flat movie.  The casting problems were evident and the participation of Bruce Willis feels like a cliché.
B007549W62|5|DRAMA, SUSPENSE, ACTION, ..an AMAZING Story-Line with Amazing Actors and a Director who did an Amazing Job!! Amazing attention to detail and Character evolution!! Best movie I've seen in 2-years!!  Brief Plot (because too much to cover to give a thorough Plot description): WHAT IF.... Nuclear Bomb Blasts hit NYC... leaving it like Hiroshima/Chernobyl??  ...WHAT IF... the \\"Lucky Ones\\" died in the blast, and you were trapped in basement of your apartment building, with radiation slowly seeping in?? This movie (was already at the Theater, ..now coming to DVD) is so AMAZING and PROFOUND with all AMAZING Actors doing top-notch performances (including a few \\"big-names\\")!!!
B00957T6X6|1|I have no issue with the content of George R.R. Martin's books, but the file is way too big to function on my Kindle. Every time I open the book, my kindle freezes and I need to restart it. I won't be buying box sets in the future.
B001ED7C58|3|I went to see the film with my daughter, having never read the book. Film was kind of fun. Read the book, loved it. Bought the soundtrack. Went to see the film again to see better how it compared to the book (and to really get to watch the film without someone giggling behind me), and to my amazement found that the Robert Pattinson song was clear and crisp in the film, but mumbled so badly on the soundtrack CD that I had to look up the words online to find out the lyrics. If I am not mistaken, I think I also heard Pattinson sing another song in the film (that would make two total) that is not on this CD. I could be wrong on that, but I don't think so.     Some of the songs are pretty good, but I think the CD is poorly produced in and of itself. Too bad one cannot buy a clearer version.
B00CLILB66|5|Wonderful concept and fine performances by Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins.
0385504225|3|I wasn't too surprised to find that Brown wrote yet another book in the same style as before. This book had the typical Langdon quest to track something down while solving a puzzle after a stream of brilliant deductions that he was able to come up with quickly and while under pressure. It had the usual good guys and bad guys and people who might have been one or the other but one couldn't really be sure. And in the end, something or somebody isn't what it had appeared to be.<br /><br />Despite that, Brown managed to make things work in the past by having good story lines and far fetched circumstances that one could have accepted as possible given the situation. This time, things were such a stretch that I still cannot imagine the most insane person ending up in the role of this novel's villain.<br /><br />A real person can be brilliant, yet sometimes miss things. When it's not a real person, an author must figure out what the main character could conceivably overlook that would be accepted by the readership. In Angels and Demons, I thought it was a stretch that Langdon did not find it obvious that a symbol he was looking at was a mirror image.  In this book, we are expected to believe that Langdon's unmatched talents for decoding symbols could leave him drawing a blank because he could not tell that something was upside down.<br /><br />In this novel, the CIA has a top person looking into things for some unknown reason. This person is supposed to be such a super spy that she knows everything that anybody anywhere is doing. It's never made clear in the book why it would be a legitimate CIA affair, unless you accept that they can run amok for their own benefit. But more importantly, we find out that much of the knowledge that this character has comes from a pre-existing wiretap of somebody's cell phone. Yet after a day of monitoring things, a text message gets sent from that phone that would have presented the opportunity for the CIA to end the entire problem almost instantly while averting another disaster.<br /><br />If there had been some explanation why they had missed it, perhaps I would have understood. But it never came up. Even if that character could have overlooked something so obvious, could her entire staff of top level CIA operatives have monitored phone calls and voice mail for the phone but missed a text message? I don't think so. This same person was aware of a different text message that nobody could have possibly known about. Go figure.<br /><br />If Langdon initially got fooled into something by never confirming the legitimacy of a phone message, is it credible that other highly intelligent leading characters would also act based on an unconfirmed phone call, or accept a text message at face value or fail to look at one from a phone that is being monitored? How many times can people make the same mistake?<br /><br />Several times in the story, Brown wanted to mislead readers into thinking something else. So he did it by saying that something else happened. Then later he says that that wasn't what really happened.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />We are supposed to believe that a son who is not willing to follow in his father's footsteps but is willing to take untold millions of dollars in inheritance is not smart enough to get out of a jam on his own. His father could have taken the dishonest path by bribing somebody, but the son is too stupid to figure out on his own that he could have bribed someone. Just when you think the son should be able to figure that out, You are told that something else happens. It would have required the son to be stupid and to have shot off his mouth to an impossible extent for what followed. It would have made no sense for a jail guard never to have asked for a bribe or for him to go along with a tenuous plan involving a third party that would have been simple had the son been involved instead.<br /><br />We are then expected to believe that a father's honesty which would haveleft his son in jail for another day or so for something the son did wrong would be considered such an outrage that the son would be willing to dedicate the rest of his life to revenge, killing off his whole family, trying to destroy the entire nation, even though doing so would involve learning everything he eschewed in the first place, but to a much further level, and would be accompanied by so much other learning, preparation, and untold endeavors. He would have to study arcane aspects of religion, culture, and philosophy to get away with it. He would also have to miss the entire message of everything he learned along the way and never have the thought that any pain his father might have caused was insignificant compared to the literal pain he brought upon himself afterward. By literal, I mean literal.<br /><br />The biggest reason for any outrage over the father's actions was supposedly that it lead to the death of his son. But his son could not have gotten outraged for that reason since he never died and was never in danger of dying. And had he died, he would not have been outraged since he would have been dead. Had the reader believed he had died, then the reader would have needed to believe that the person outraged by the death was the person who did the killing. Such a person would have been more likely to have been grateful for the opportunity, given the wealth he obtained by doing so.<br /><br />In the end Brown wants you to think the thing you ruled out in the beginning, accepting that a family was never asked to identify a body and that law enforcement was fine with that, and that Brown's explicit statements were supposed to have been interpreted as \\"it seemed as if...\\" are all a mistake on your part. I'm sure I'm not the only person who read through those paragraphs a second time before continuing with the book just to be sure things weren't happening in the obvious way. But in the end, we find out that at least that part really did happen in the obvious way.<br /><br />As to the big mystery of life that the quest was supposed to reveal, Brown would have been better off ending the book earlier with the message that the secrets were once again safe where they belonged. That would have been fine with Langdon who never cared about such secrets in the first place. Instead, Langdon persists until his once again super sharp cryptographic skills allow him to unlock a secret that was not really a secret to the people who were keeping it a secret, and nothing more than something that is already a common viewpoint among many.<br /><br />A final point is that if you kill of Langdon too early in the book, readers will know it didn't make any sense. Just because you said he was dead didn't mean he was dead. It meant you wanted us to think so, and later you want us to say \\"I guess I was wrong. I never saw it coming that he might be alive somehow.\\" Things like that took all the suspense out of it. And since Langdon was left alive, we are all left waiting for that next sequel.d wrong would be considered such an outrage that the son would be willing to dedicate the rest of his life to revenge, killing off his whole family, trying to destroy the entire nation, even though doing so would involve learning everything he eschewed in the first place, but to a much further level, and would be accompanied by so much other learning, preparation, and untold endeavors.

006202406X|5|good book
B002APU580|5|A condensed p&p, slightly adapted, still done very well. Nice cinematography.  Will watch again! Was missing the Hursts, not sure why?
0385504209|3|The book unfolds in fairly typical thriller fashion: the protagonist, mistakenly accused of murder, finds himself in possession of something for which the real murderer will kill again.  Therefore he must run from the police and the bad guys alike, while seeking to solve the murder mystery.  The bad guys appear to be part of a larger conspiracy - are they trying to obtain, reveal, or destroy an ages-old secret?  As he works to solve the mystery, biblical scholar Robert Langdon draws on - and explains endlessly - his research regarding secret religious societies and alternate interpretations of key Christian symbols.  I found the history to be interesting if not always accurate.<br />The historical material is grafted onto the basic thriller format without being integral to it, and that is my key criticism of this book.  Unlike, say, Eco at his best, Brown did not make me feel the weight of the esoteric topic under investigation.  Without giving away all the details, I will say that I became increasingly skeptical that the secrets in question would be so earth-shattering if revealed; rather they would be as open to interpretation as the more traditional Biblical canon.  Still, Brown kept me turning the pages even as I felt increasingly frustrated with the clunky predictability of the plot.

B00BHHIWQO|3|The game is okay. But why did my battery die after playing for 15 minutes with the screen fully dimmed? I do like that it forces you to break (unless you want to pay real money for more lives) or you can get more lives by connecting on facebook. no thanks.

B006LSZECO|5|The only thing I did not like about this book was the ending; and not because it wasn't good, but because it wasn't how I wanted it to end. But, such is life. Just because Gillian Flynn doesn't outright say it doesn't mean that the bad guy doesn't suffer in the end...very creatively done...
B008220D5K|2|I was turning 40 so I thought it could be a good idea. Big mistake, depressing with a few good moments.
1904994679|5|First saw this book at Barnes and Noble for nearly thirty dollars. I knew my son would love it, but didn't want to pay the cover price. I was thrilled to find it here at such a bargain!   It is a beautiful book! ... Colorful photos and fun facts  galore ... from cover to cover!  My 9 year old son is enjoying it and so is the rest of the family!
B009NQKXYK|1|what a let down. Showed such promise in the trailers. I should have believed the reviews I read. Very disappointed.
B00HTJOGM8|5|sometimes--rarely, a book comes along that you hate to have end.  This is proving to be one of them.  I am not yet finished but very wrapped up in the life and times of this young man.  I think it is on every book club list even tho' it is an investment in time due to the length of the book.  A great read !
B007TXN4TK|5|I can't complain about anything that is free. It is easy to use and fun, so I'm happy with it.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I must say, being an adult, I was expecting this book to be extremely juvenile. However, after several coworkers and friends kept encouraging me, I broke down and bought the kindle version. I'll be the first to admit how I so wrongly misjudged this masterpiece. I finished it in roughly two days. Brilliant work, and such a truly inspiring story, especially for someone who works very closely with sick kids/teenagers.
B00011D1OA|5|thanks
B000V6BE6C|5|With the exception of Nightmare, this is by far Avenged Sevenfold's best album.  From the Rev's haunting vocals on Critical Acclaim and A Little Piece of Heaven, to the speed guitar and almost prophetic lyrics on Afterlife and Almost Easy, to the usual A7X clever lyrics on Unbound, this CD is great from start to finish.  If you are an A7X fan, chances are you already have this cd, and if not, then this CD might just have the power to make you one, a must buy for all!

B003ZSJ212|4|This brief review is coming from a casual Star Wars fan, far from some of the fanatics who hate anything but the original versions.   Movies:    These are the same great Star Wars movies everyone knows.  I personally like all 6 as the story really pulls you in, although many purists simply hate the new ones.  This is understandable, but the casual fan will like them all.  Yes there were some changes added to the Blu-ray editions, but I don't think they are as bad as most have made them out to be.  This is especially the case if you're younger and may have never seen the original versions to begin with.  Overall, some of the greatest movies you'll ever see, especially if you have any interest in Sci-fi.  Video Quality:    The video quality of these 1080p Blu-ray's is very good for the most part.  Episode 3 is excellent and this is expected given it is the most recent.  All of the original 3 Episodes have very good quality which is really saying something considering their age.  Episode 2 is all pretty decent with episode 1 having the worst quality of the 6.  This is due to much of it being filmed with with early versions of digital cameras.  Overall I would give the picture quality a 4/5 for the entire series, taking into account the age of the films.  Audio Quality:  This is where all of these films really excel.  The sound is great on a simple 2 channel system, but watch these on a full surround sound home theater and prepare to be amazed!  There are very few other movies I have seen where the sound is on this level.  The light sabers hum around you, rumbling of spaceships and the dialogue are all top notch.  All of the Star Wars episodes definitely provide reference level sound, which I give a 5/5.  Extras:  I've never been one to watch extras, but this saga contains tons of extras to keep you busy for a long time.  If you want to see documentaries, behind the scenes and deleted scenes from Star Wars, then this Blu-Ray saga is for you!  Overall Impressions:  Overall, the Star Wars Blu-ray saga is a great addition for any Star Wars enthusiast or one who demands the best home theater experience available.  If you already have the DVD's, upgrading would be necessary only if you want to hear and see the absolute best.  I personally felt it was worth the upgrade for the audio quality alone and the great picture quality is the icing. I give the Blu-ray saga a 4.5/5 overall with perfect scores for the movies and audio.  While the picture quality is great, I feel they messed around with Episodes 1 and 2 a bit too much by adding too much edge enhancement, dropping my overall score a tad.
B0086700CM|5|the game is a lot of fun. Im addicted to it! I love it. challenging too. I recommend it. You will play it everyday.
B007TKT2SK|5|One very helpful App... Love it
B00COGY2P2|3|The HD version constantly stopped running and needed to download in the best parts of the movie.  The Movie would have been great if it wasn't being interrupted constantly.
1559408855|2|If you've seen Saw, you've seen worse than this.  I love Pasolini's Medea, so, when you add in the legendary status this film boasts, I was really looking forward to something amazing.  Of course, what was shocking in the pre-Saw, Hostel, etc., etc. world doesn't shock as much anymore.  The flat performances do little to help this extremely dated seeming film.  While the shot composition was obviously a point of lavish attention, often the tableaux are textbook exercises with no real joy in them - and are even repetitive and predictable.  To me the film comes off simply pretentious, flat, poorly acted, and vaguely nauseating in a way that annoys without shocking.  Caligula is a much better and even more transgressive film, even without the scat play which figures so prominently in this film.  If you're wanting something that titillates, yet is more effective as a tragedy, I would recommend that film instead.
B006LSZECO|5|I have never read a book that held my interest as much as this did. I just could not put it down!

B004SJ3BCI|1|OMG....are you kidding me? You wiped out my angry birds space scores now you wipe out my angry birds scores? WTF? Can you not come up with any new levels so you make us start over? Unbelievable....so over angry birds and the BS. I enjoyed them until they decided that it is all about money and merchandise
B003XF1XOQ|5|Best. Book. Ever.
B00S4YGWD8|1|WTF!  After hearing such good things about this movie, I kept saying the line &#34;If it's in a word or it's in a look you can't get rid of the Babadook.&#34; until I received the movie in my hands and gave it a watch. Now after watching this disappointment I honestly feel like getting rid of this piece of s*it show as soon as possible. The sound level was horrible, the child needed to be shot and this movie did not scare me once. The show had a good sense of buildup right throughout but it just never materialized into anything. A fitting ending would be to kill the little boy because for all of his antics at the start of the show he deserved to die at the hands of the mother. (preferrably if she could choke him to death or cover his face with a pillow). The mother should have taken her life also similarly to how the Babadook story book intended her die. This movie is not really worth the time and I would definitely suggest a rental before purchasing.  If this movie did not have such a cool slipcover it would have probably ended up in the trash.

B00H71PBQ8|5|Addicting...amazing series...award worthy!
0545615402|5|All I have to say is wow. I love J.K Rollings work. She really knows how to use her talent. These three books are great. I love them and I cant wait to show them off to my Harry Potter fan friends. I got the hard cover which are made strong. The books were very well made. Theses books look like they really belong in the HP world. I got my books right on time,  so a week all in all. It is well worth the money, also not a bad price. If your a Harry Potter fan I would say get these books.
B007P3Q95K|5|Richard II<br />Five Stars (and then some)<br /><br />This adaptation was very well acted, filmed, and staged. In fact, Ben Whishaw is now my new favourite actor -- I'd seen him before in Bright Star and Brideshead Revisited and he was good; seeing him in Shakespeare, however, is nothing short of a treat.<br />The cuts in this production were few and made with much more skill than in the other plays. Every actor delivered his lines with feeling and understanding, and the physical acting was well-suited to the words. At times the acting went a bit overboard, but only when Shakespeare's language or the story being told goes overboard (the surrendering scene, with the looking-glass and the crown, featured a deposed Richard rolling around on the floor).<br />The filming, costumes and sets were gorgeous, which only made the great acting and Shakespeare's beautiful writing shine all the more.<br />Parallels with Christ and St. Sebastian were perhaps belaboured a bit much visually, but this is the only flaw, and a small one at that. Belabouring the parallel is in itself all right, but it did start to get old.<br />Many small cuts were made, but these were skilfully done and nothing was cut that would change the story.<br />There was one small change to the plot. They replaced Exton at the end of the play with Aumerle. Surprisingly, it worked.<br />Also, Henry Percy was left out entirely; this was somewhat disappointing, but since he figures largely in 1 Henry IV and these productions imply that many years pass between the two plays, it would be very difficult to rectify the time if Percy was not cut.<br /><br />Henry IV (both parts)<br />Four Stars<br /><br />These two were good. They suffered from some cuts (The King's whining about not being able to go to the Holy Land was neatly snipped out, for example) but were well acted, well filmed and overall a good pair of movies.<br />I wasn't very impressed, but then I'm not very impressed with these two plays on paper; I don'tthink I'll ever come to like Falstaff and Pistol no matter who plays them. I like Shakespeare for the beautiful writing and the in-depth character studies and the complex political intrigue and the elaborate punning insults. I'm not much a fan of fat jokes and pee jokes and plots which revolve around a bunch of thugs getting drunk and robbing each other;, but this is what a good portion of Henry IV is comprised of.<br />Despite this, however, this was a good version of these plays. It had some superb acting, especially Jeremy Irons as The King and Joe Armstrong as Henry Percy.<br /><br />Henry V<br />Four Stars<br /><br />Overall, it was good, but it was lacking in some ways. Tom Hiddleston as Henry is good, though I have seen better.<br />A few of the cuts (uncut Shakespeare is too much to expect from any film adaptation) made a good deal of sense (\\"no king of England if not king of France\\" was divorced from its rhyming couplet, making it actually more meaningful [especially considering that Hiddleston sort of gnawed on and pronounced as ditties the rhyming couplets elsewhere in the play]), a few were disappointing simply because I wanted to see something which they cut out (the whole scene with the traitors, the French bragging about their armour and horses), and some just made no sense (boys and luggage).<br /><br />Most of the comic relief was lopped out of the play; this works, but it changes the overall tone to something more sombre. Gower, Macmorris and, Jamy were entirely omitted, and Fluellen's part was reduced to \\"Captain with Welsh accent\\"; no lengthy rambles about Romans, and no lines beginning with things like \\"do you think that therefore it is meet\\" and no \\"Alexander the Pig\\", and no amusing lists of synonyms.<br />No leek-whacking scene, either -- like the Branagh adaptation, Pistol breaks down part way though the battle, so we also miss the \\"fir and ferret and firk\\" scene.<br /><br />And they cut out the whole thing with the boys and the luggage butleft in the order to kill the French prisoners. It's cause and effect, if you want to cut the cause, you have to either cut the effect or substitute a different cause.<br />Hiddleston gets a KHAAAAN moment and shouts up at the sky \\"I was not angry since I came to France until this instant!\\" for seemingly no reason at all. Actually, this is the only cut that really made no sense; the rest were only a bit disappointing.<br /><br />Also, Henry's tendency to attribute everything to God was neatly pared down, presumably to make it more palatable to a non-religious audience. It wasn't entirely omitted, though, which, as someone capable of seeing a play the way the original audience saw it, I appreciate.<br /><br />Hiddleston's Henry is mostly a personable and affable king; the St. Crispin's Day and \\"Once more unto the breach\\" speeches were believable and the wooing of Katharine was sufficiently awkward (though it was heavily trimmed, notably the \\"have my babies\\" bit). Unlike Branagh (who conveys an exuberant braggadocio tempered by a cold unfeeling) and Olivier (who spends the entire movie posing and being a grand and exalted king), Hiddleston gives the character a full range of human emotion, the subdued fire of the tennis balls scene was quite good.<br />Occasionally he's too obviously reading lines of a play (rhyming couplets, hello), but mostly what we have is a good actor doing a convincing job of being King Harry the Fift.
B00BAXFECK|2|The first part of the book was exquisitely sad and poignant but the last three quarters have been plodding to be kind.  I REALLY don't need every single point of dialog communicated.  I was waiting for it on the library wait list but was so impatient due to the great reviews that against my better judgement I went ahead and purchased it for kindle.  Wish I had my time and money back :(  I really wanted to love it!
0385341679|5|This is most likely the best fantasy paranormal series I will ever read, certainlly the best I've read so far.  I'm sure I would have slowly gone insane waiting for Shadowfever to be published after the mysterious (not really) cliffhanger in Dreamfever.  Thank the gods I did not discover the series until after all the books had been published.  Needless to say the ending book to the series - Shadowfever - turned out to be far beyond my expectations.  Ms. Moning is a master storyteller who thoroughly researches the factual parts of her stories and brings her characters fully to life. The stories themselves are woven from some mystical place only she knows. May she continue to weave these tales until I am no longer around to read.
B004SBX112|3|The pigs are at it again. If you have played any angry birds game you have played this. That is not a bad thing, however. With levels based on holidays it is a nice addition.
B0000TB01Y|5|This is an excellent recording of the musical. There is also a very minimum of dialogue included, what you have here is pretty much just the songs, which I took as a positive. Some of them, however, are really short sleepers that you pay little attention to in the play.    The great ones, however, are magnificently performed and sound wonderful.    All in all, a good purchase.    Side note, album art is beautiful, liner notes non-existent.
141971189X|5|Very good book and one of the best of it's series
B00AREIAI8|3|it seems like a REAL HORSE!!<br />I wish the horses weren't so much money or of gems.<br />I like the competion.
B00BXKOMT6|3|This book was... fine. I don't normally do reviews, but the love this book is getting seems strange to me, so I'm writing this in the hopes that others don't get their hopes up as I did. I certainly don't see the 'this-is-as-good-as' comparisons people are making to established authors like Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson. The storyline was middling, some of the prose felt awkward and though there were some decent scenes in the story, I never felt as if it was particularly compelling - not a book I couldn't put down at any point. The main character never really clicked with me, either.<br /><br />Having said all that, if you lower your expectations (think perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road self-published fantasy, as opposed to a modern classic), it's a decent enough time-waster if you've already read all the bigger fantasy authors out there.
B000005IU2|5|I could and almost did start this review by stating the obvious.  This is   what rock and roll should sound like.  We have 4 marginally talented  musicians (@ that time anyway) playing with tremendous heart and creative  desire.  This along with the debut was the prototype for every punk record  ever.  Hell, some punk bands made whole careers just rewriting one of these  songs over and over again.  This is what separates Iggy from punk.  Iggy  wanted to make rock and roll records and it came out Iggy.  Punk bands wanted to make Iggy records and they came out punk.
0743506650|5|Though far from the definitive writer's guideline, this book shines a  unique perspective on the craft. Stephen King lays down the law and then  teaches it. He shares his techniques, his pet peeves, and his own personal  horrific experiences - both as child and adult - and he does it all within  the cerebral classroom of the printed page. He wraps a juicy filling of  personal tragedy, growth and experience within a tight covering of his  famous story telling style. <br />   As a human, I was touched by his  childhood anecdotes and often laughed with him about his insecurities. I am  still in awe at what he has recently had to overcome physically. I mean,  damn.<br />   As a writer, I am grateful for a brief glimpse into his  vocational world. I gained confidence from learning about things I have  been doing right and have changed many bad habits (may the adverb rest in  peace). I've read several tomes on the subject and believe his reigns as  the most complete.<br />   I've been a fan of King's since the seventh grade  when I was given The Dead Zone and Cujo as an Easter present. A year later  I had read every book he'd published (with the exception of the dreaded  Limited Editions of which I could opine negatively for hours - suffice it  to say that writing should be for everyone to read, not just the rich).  I've read or listened to all his books since. I can honestly say, that this  is my favorite.<br />   Sometimes the coldest hands to wrap around your neck  are the true ones.<br />   The only bad thing I can say about this book is  that it's too short, something one rarely has the opportunity to state  regarding the beloved author.<br />   A huge thank you to Mr. King for a brief  indulgence into the life of a genius.
B0089LOG02|5|Excellent book, very fast read and I thoroughly enjoyed the parallels of the women's lives in the storyline.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game us awsome I thought it was kind of boring but then my friend downloaded the game and  I played it I was surprised by how cool and also.e it was so I downloaded it best thing I ever did
B007M45PMU|5|For at least the first two weeks, I had to listen to the album over and over, every day (not usually one for continual repeat).  Even with some more rest in-between now, there is something to love every time I go back.  Different songs grew on me for different rounds, but always something to appreciate.  If the samples catch you, it only gets better!
B000J103YI|5|Being a big fan of \\"Dreamgirls\\" over the years, I've eagerly awaited the release of the film version for more than a year.  Fortunately, the soundtrack lived up to the movie's hype!    While Jamie Foxx's take on \\"When I First Saw You\\" was nothing terribly special, the rest of the cast shines throughout the soundtrack.  Jennifer Hudson's voice is amazing in the role of Effie.  Beyonce, Rose, & Murphy are also terrific.      Though a couple of the songs from the stage version have been dropped, all of the primary songs remain intact - with a couple of terrific songs added as well.     Best Tracks include:    Move  Steppin' To The Bad Side  Love You I Do  Dreamgirls  And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going  Patience  I Am Changing  One Night Only (both versions)  Hard To Say Goodbye    Can't you just smell the Oscar nominations coming?

B0087ZG7UW|5|After seeing this movie at the theater, I was so nervous when I took a shower while traveling. It's one of those DVD's that you will not go wrong in owning.
B003VBVQKS|5|To me, this is a perfect album from beginning to end. An album never given the respect it deserves among purist. Perhaps it is an prototype of what later became Whitesnake (who I love). This line up of Deep Purple was and is devastating in nature. The vocal harmonies of DC and Glenn Hughes.....the roots of Purple Jon Lord and Ian Paice and most of all...the legendary Tommy Bolin. He was truly one of a kind and gone too soon. &#34;Come taste the Band&#34; stands tall along side every other great Purple album and should be a part of every rock music collection.
B003ZSJ212|1|I am old enough to remember watching the original releases of all the Star Wars movies prior the \\"Special Editions\\"    Whilst not perfect, they still hold a special place in my memory for having the most astounding special effects of it's day. These are the films that should be lovingly preserved in their original form and cleaned up for re-release on Blu-ray so that the current generation can astound at what beauty can be generated from models and stop animation prior to the coming of the CGI juggernaught.     George Lucas has destroyed the time consuming artistry of the original special effects crew by cheapening the original films with horrible stop-gap measures to try and make the original trilogy more visually similar with Episodes I-III.     There are an overwhelming majority of 1 star reviews on this sight already so I shan't go into the extensive details and changes which are already painstakingly noted by fans.    I just want to add another 1 star review to vent my frustration at how that idiot Lucas succeeded in making a legendary mythology into a steaming pile of trash.
B005K17RU0|5|My biggest gripe with this kindle is the horrible low quality apps. That said, this app is actually a high quality weather app. I also have it on my Verizon galaxy s4 and love their widget too.
B00IRISI42|1|Very slow read
B00EL8I8IS|1|Boring
B000ZM1FXO|3|The plot relies on genre convention and the understanding that Cesar's go mad with power.  That's basically it.  For the sheer amount of nudity and death in this film, there are virtually zero sexually enticing scenes, or closeups of blood being drawn.  There is no intercourse even close to being depicted in this film.  It's so bizarre.  Lots of gaudy unrealistic sets though.<br /><br />You might think I didn't like the film, but it was actually thought provoking.  Trying to figure out the mind of Caligula (acted by A Clockwork Orange's Malcolm McDowell) was fun.  He made this movie interesting for me.  Seeing a young Helen Mirren was actually kind of terrifying... sorry Helen.
B000002KKD|5|Their 1979 absolute must-have (or least borrow it first) eponymous debut effort. A new wave classic. I, personally remember when this lp first hit the stores. Something like six months later, ALREADY vinyl bootlegs were obtainable. Let's face it, at THAT time the music scene was in need of several changes. Totally dug about every track on this CD reissue, such as \\"52 Girls\\", the awesome \\"Dance This Mess Around\\", their smash hit \\"Rock Lobster\\" (ironically, my LEAST favorite cut on this disc), \\"Lava\\", \\"Hero Worship\\" and their version of \\"Downtown\\". Highly recommended.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Greatest game ever, so addictive and many characters to play with in all of the different modes. Like trigger but ten times better
B004XDYJRU|3|it's ok
B00HV8TN7K|3|Good. Reminded me of castaway.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is very fun but don't waste your money and energy.....you will need it!!!! I do recommend this game.
B00HQIZBE4|4|this is an extremely detailed set which I really enjoyed making.<br />I love the details of each floor, starting from the kitchen at first floor, the bedroom on the 2nd floor and the 3rd floor.
B00W6XM002|3|Have not played enough but so far it seems quite entertaining.
B005NFW0U0|3|I'm not sure that I'll be watching the next season.  The series is too much like a vampire soap opera.
B008NAFU9A|4|Words were clear, easy to download, the book kept you captivated and wondering what was gonna happen next. Brought all ranges of emotion.
B00EVCD9HY|5|This album was awesome. I had no clue JM was so amazingly talented. BUY THIS ALBUM it will bring joy to your ears :)
B00BAXFACO|5|I have read every one of Michael Connelly's books.  I think he is one of the best authors I have ever read!  Lots of twists and turns plenty of suspense and character development.  The most important part for me is that the story reads a true.  I know this author spend a good deal of time with police and in the criminal justice system (as a newspaper man) and it shows.  If you like crime drama then you will like this book!
B003K7BQZI|5|So my husband and I stumbled across Dr. Who on instant play and were curious about it. We had heard great things about it, but never watched it. Now, my husband and I are not huge nerds, but we still loved Dr. Who. I couldn't tell you who played the Dr. in the 1970's version, or name the actors of the previous 8 Dr's, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the new Dr. Who. Chris Eccleston was the first Dr. and he did a phenomenal job. He was quirky and strange, and made me somewhat uncomfortable, but I loved him anyway. The 2nd (or 10th) doctor was David Tennant. He also played Barty Crouch Jr. in Harry Potter 4. I've got to say, that he is by far my favorite out of the 3. He was deep, but funny and you can't help but fall in love with his character. Matt Smith was the 3rd (or 11th) Dr. I hated him at first. He annoyed me so much! But honestly he kind of grew on me. He is still my least favorite, but makes for a very interesting change of character. If you like sci fi or just plain adventure, you have got to watch this series. I think it was a series made for passionate fanatics and non nerds alike. We all can appreciate the experience offered to us by Dr. Who!
0143036556|5|The only unfortunate aspect of Diamond's comparative history is that it too often gets confused with the work of James Kunstler because both wrote books that appeal to readers interested in climate change.  The difference is that Diamond is an actual geographer while Kunstler is just a lunatic.  Collapse uses an anthropological framework to analyze extinct societies in terms of their relationship to the environment, including an extensive discussion of modern societies in varying degrees of social collapse due to an unsustainable relationship with survival resources.
B00AEFY6ZQ|5|not John Wayne type movie but got say he did a super job in it and it really a movie  you can watch over and still enjoy .full of fun and just easy to watch & enjoy. love see more of this type movie as so relaxing.
B00FJRRVII|4|good but missing most commonly drivers support
B006VREHRS|5|Steve Buscemi is such a good actor
B0070YDOT8|5|Good games
B0070NSPCU|5|I was pleasantly surprised at how good this novel was.  I was apprehensive at first because of the self published nature of the kindle book, but I purchased it based on the overwhelming number of positive reviews.<br /><br />I have been searching for something that I could really sink my teeth into.  I only recently discovered Brandon Sanderson, and I quickly consumed everything he has written, leaving me with more free time.  I have read many epic series, from George R.R. Martin (May the fat liberal slob rot for writing so slowly and being on the verge of ruining a very promising story) who went the wayside like Robert Jordan, who inevitably bloated their excellent stories beyond recognition.  Same with Terry Goodkind who tried and almost succeeded in blowing up the Sword of truth series.  I can always go back and re-read the greats from Guy Gavriel Kay, Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Fiest Brooks, Morcock, Anthony, Howard and others.<br /><br />But I wanted something new, and this was a refreshing story from a \\"nobody\\" (yet).  I love his secret to e-publishing success \\"Write a good book.\\"<br /><br />I think you underestimate yourself Mr. Ryan.  In your case the key to self publishing was \\"Write a great book.\\"
B00I6JOBTI|5|Awesome movie
6305718954|5|I'm sorry to say, the critics bashed this movie to the ground. In fact, they did it so blatently hard that Stigmata did horrible in the box office.  Many people go by what the critics say and Stigmata is living proof that you shouldn't, this is a very entertaining film so don't listen to everyone. And as you can see, the Amazon readers \\"for the most part\\" seem to enjoy the movie more than the big guys do. I've heard comments that \\"people enjoyed the movie when it came to DVD moreso than they did when they watched it on the big screen. Why is this? I'm not really sure. Maybe it seems more like a made for \\"TV Movie\\" but I don't feel that is the case. It doesn't seem to be a \\"cheaply\\" made movie by any means and the actors are known. Nonetheless... <br /> <br />It's no Exoricst or Gone with The Wind, but Stigmata is fun and anyone that enjoys a tale about religion/horror movie in general, should give it a chance. Gabriel Burne (Father Andrew Kiernan) plays the role of the slash scientist/priest quite well. I always thought he was a wonderful actor. He also played Satan in End of Days and played a big role in \\"Point of No Return\\" with Bridgette Fonda. His wonderful acting skills are very well done. This great popcorn movie puts a stab into religion in general and some might be offended, but remember, it's just a movie!!! Once again, the Catholics are attacked, but it's all believeable and fun at the same time. Patrica Arquette does a substantial job as her role as a self admitting atheist who gets inflicted with the Stygmata. A simple hairdresser brought into the madness.  <br /> <br />She kind of looks bored through some her scenes and she needs to show a little more emotion and spunk in my opinion, but \\"Gabriel\\" saves most of the scenes when they are both together. The movie takes a lot of it's general ideas from the Exorcist, same idea, just a different time and infliction only now with a twist.  I felt the movie is very suspenseful, clever, dramatic and the acting is very well done. This movie won't bring you any closer to God, that's not what it's trying to do, it's just trying to do something different and fun, and I think Stigmata succeeds! Buy it now if you haven't seen it. Good stuff.
098641400X|5|Enjoyed the plot twists and development of the characters.  Not your average twist writing.  Many authors use gratuitous violence or sex to somehow make the plot move, and Weston manages to write a fairly fast paced novel and he lets his plot and characters drive the book without resorting to those two tactics.  Mr. Weston manages to create characters that have depth and yet his characters come with flaws that each have to work around and with to &#34;save the day.&#34; Waiting to see what comes next from Mr. Weston!
0312380852|4|This is a very nice book to work from.  Has several nice tutorials.  I made a couple bracelets from it and one of them sold within an hour of it being on the table.
