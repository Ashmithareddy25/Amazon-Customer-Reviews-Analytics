B000AURPGM|5|it was more than what i expected. ...very good product and pleased with prices! !
B009FPLH8A|4|Cool decal I moved the kill markers around to make it my own.
B00C0W9AJS|5|For what it is, this product was great a small budget lift that really only gives additional ground clearance, it was simple and relatively easy to install. Came with good instructions and everything packaged well.
B0041RPGQ6|3|It worked well but I found within a month the cord had pulled out causing the unit to blow the fuse.
B00HB9KCCE|5|Perfect fit and easy installation.
B008BLKI2U|1|Did not even get my sticker junk very cheap
B00UHD4HJA|2|I'm kind of disappointed. Out of the 50 stickers I only got maybe 10 that I actually liked.
B000F18Z6U|1|Had a very cheep look and feel.  Not what I was expecting.
B00514BAR2|5|This compliments the Kury grips better than the add on that just wraps around the grips. It is adjustable. Gives the hand a chance to let go and get some stress release without using or needing a throttle lock. If you are OCD, you can buy one extra for the opposite side so they match, but the left one would be non-functional and only for appearance.
B00Q4O1I0M|5|I'm usually a L/XL, 14/16 and after purchasing the size 16, I found them to be a bit baggy. GoGo Gear exchanged them for a smaller size and they fit great! The look is flattering and they're well designed. I wouldn't wear these for highway riding but they're great for my city commutes and I feel like they'd provide decent skin protection in a low speed crash. The Kevlar against your skin gets a bit itchy in hot weather but that's the nature of the beast. It's really nice to see a company make a wide variety of  women's sizes!
B001F0KO6O|5|Instructions were complete, ports clearly marked. I hope it keeps water out of the fuel. You will need to get barbed fuel fittings, 5/16&#34; threaded and hose clamps.
B00H7LVV3A|5|Works great on the Harley
B004QEJ6UQ|4|Should work fine for our use, occasional  use while camping.
B004GCGYAI|1|Excellent. my mirror was replaced, rendering my vehicle complete, and beautiful once more.
B0043E39I4|3|I love the idea of these clamps.  Unfortunately you must have at least 2&#34; to 2 1/4&#34; of straight pipe on each side of the joint  (total of 4&#34; to 4 1/2&#34;).  These clamps will not conform to a bend in the pipe and will then leak.  On a positive note: I used an air impact wrench to tighten one and it held up beautifully.  I ended up just using my MIG welder to weld the joints because no clamp would have worked.
B0094MLZ4A|1|I have a 2001 e46 330ci. It no come close of fitting. The main base was better the OEM part. The holes to screw in did not line up with the car. Dont waste ur money
B0009X9F6I|5|Just installed this a few days ago and it was a direct bolt on for the problem prone Chevy Suburban round factory hitch. I have seen too many pictures of torn hitch welds and didnt want to take a chance with towing a potential new rv. I would rather have an over engineered hitch than one that was too week.
B003NOFGUO|2|Instructions were not clear
B000E2AO1E|4|Worked perfectly
B00FJW61AW|5|As advertised.
B000CFDHVC|5|works great
B00G3YYTP4|5|Switch installed easily and is working perfectly.
B0063RHGFG|4|These would have been awesome, but the fault was mine ... I needed a set for a v-6, and these are for a four cylinder engine. Shipping was insanely fast.
B001CEG90I|5|This was purchased for my 2010 Lexus RX350. These are a fraction of the price of those available elsewhere, specifically the dealer. They are also not that difficult to replace via the glove box.<br /><br />I can't speak to the performance since I don't have a suitable means of a deep analysis. It looks of similar quality to the original. Seriously though this is a very basic filter whose performance will depend more on how long it's been used.  Mine fills with all kinds of debris so frequent replacement is far more important. These are inexpensive enough to but 4 at a time and to replace often.
B00FRHOI86|5|These are the first &#34;beam&#34; style blades I've ever purchased and I wasn't sure how they would work, but given that the traditional style blades fade so quickly in our regional sun, I figured it couldn't hurt to try them.  As I would expect, they came with every attachment I needed to install them and I had no problems getting them installed.  They've been great so far, even application across the windshield and the Rain-X effect is definitely there (of course we also typically apply Rain-X when we wash our car so I can't say how much comes from the blades).  We've only had them for nearly a season so far so I can't speak to longevity so far, but they've made it through one summer at least so far.  Aug 27, 2016: These have survived at least one Texas summer and are continuing to work well. We've been so pleased we picked up another set for our other vehicle which needed new blades. We'd definitely recommend these blades.
B00O83NSY0|1|Got the lights yesterday and installed. Lights do not work. Emailed seller about lights and have not heard back yet.
B00NJXQLXA|5|love it
B000CLQCLS|5|was a good deal
B00R8EW50E|5|Great Product!
B0002L6A9W|5|This seems really durable and heavy, unlike those cheap models that look like bubble wrap enclosed in thin foil that start falling apart after a year. It fit the window well. The test of its effectiveness: when I take it out of the window at the end of the day, the side facing the outside is hot enough to burn my hands (obviously not cause medical burns but really hurt if I touch it for just a couple seconds), but the inside is cool to the touch. So while it is admittedly too expensive, it does seem to be worth it.
B00296IF6E|5|Made my motor look fantastic, right down to the bare block
B00OUBZE0G|5|I'm a ups driver. And this is absolutely perfect
B008F8Q7QU|5|Fit was easy and look really good
B000BUU5YU|5|Just what the camper ordered.  High quality.  Durable.
B00BJNSXEM|5|Worked like a charm.  Good price too.
B0009YDQEE|4|Great quality, near perfect fit for a '96 Lexus SC300. Color of heel pad different from picture and was not black, but beige which seems nicer than if it were black. 4 Stars only because item not exactly as described.
B006QLN9F0|5|Just installed it on my 07 Ford f-150 lariat crew cab truck. It brought back my truck to awesome again. Buy it you will not be disappointed.
B002309KGK|5|Works well easy to install
B009YFEMP6|4|Performed as expected, only skinned one knuckle
B00MQA58BS|5|Great plate frames, they are thick metal with an accurate emblem and crisp printing. They look fantastic on my new Buick.
B00JXYGF3U|1|We only had it two weeks and it's broken already
B00C7XVDYK|3|Correct size and all of the mounting holes are in the right places, but very thin and flimsy compared to the OEM part it replaced, which was more rigid.  But it's also half the price of the OEM part, so I guess you get what you pay for.  I suppose time will tell about its long-term durability.
B00CAUG7E6|5|Nice sticker, saved me money because I don't have to buy a new recycle bin.
B00A65OHEO|1|Junk don't waste your money. JUNK! Will absolutely break within days
B000CSSR96|4|Effectively covered my car for a year while I lived abroad and kept it clean and protected from the elements here in MN.
B00BMU9CEM|5|Work just like it said it did!
B000BKJDKM|4|Good quality cord and connectors on each end. Not cheap like some.
B002PUTC0M|5|I just received it so I can't yet speak to it's longevity.  But it appears very well built and solid.  About the battery scows of which there are many complaints:  The screws are #2 Phillips.  There are not holes in the back to access them but slots in the rubber.  #2 seems like it would be overkill for such a small device and small slots but the slot stretches and it will fit in the screw head snugly.  If you use a smaller screw driver it is likely they will strip.  Just the face lifts out once the screws are removed which you need to separate from the rubber body.  Mine came with two batteries so I have a spare.  Not sure if that was intentional but it is nice.  Like another commenter noted, adding  the &#34;Coilhose Pneumatics CH15 Closed Lock-On Chuck&#34; makes for a nice upgrade.  Time will tell if it holds up in the long run but it seems solid and well built.
B000BZG92W|5|Worked great
B0068EV0M4|1|after a failed old version Hi4 module, i bought the newer Hi4N thinking it was a better version.  less than 1000 miles it is malfunctioning after it gets warm. the front signal wire looses power intermittently & the rear signal wire gets slightly weak. when the unit is cool it works perfect. The problem was verified after testing the coil & using a brand new accel super coil. no shorts in the wires either. after some research i found this is a common problem with the HI-4N, the newer version does not have short circuit protection, (the old hi4 does have this feature). the new processor microchip & coil drivers are sub-par. basically a generic $200 part.<br /><br />i will be replacing this with a Twin Tec module (which are proven reliable)... i really wish i would have known this before purchasing.
B008OAECW0|5|The kit was simple and easy to use.
B00FMUYYT6|5|Ordered a set for my 2015 Chevy 2500 HD with factory spray in bed liner. Easy installation without tools, fits nicely and the ring is big enough to accommodate 2 ratcheting straps. Have already used them twice, they are very sturdy.
B00J88J9DO|5|Very nice.fit to size.my favorite boots for motorcycling.
B00GD9R2A8|5|Perfect, couldn't be more pleased
B0073MFJ40|4|The radiator fit was very good....so far everything looks good &  no leaks!
B00029XD62|5|I love this stuff great to cover up trim that is worn and just ugly. Make sure to spray some water when applying to get rid of the air bubbles.
B00DV7FLGW|4|Happy with it , fit ni e and pretty easy to install .
B004EIAADG|5|I charged it and used it three day st the beach all day. One thing I didn't like was the blow up figure worthless.
B00W0S23R8|4|Nothing spectacular, but for the price it's ok
B004QEQIN4|5|Excellent replacement, perfect fit, great price.
B00K150VAI|5|Fast shipping, produced arrived factory fresh, and product works great. Can't ask for anything more. Very very happy
B0041TQS5M|4|Didn't fit quite like original, but is OK.
B00FJ5LBOA|5|WOW....surprisingly powerful.  Great product and great service.  Thank you
B002MW6HRO|5|I used this with a new pioneer head unit.  I took out my cigarette lighter and replaces it with this on my 2000 Audi TT.  Works great!
B00495V8LC|5|Finally used these at 70 K to replace the OEM ones on my frontier also replace the rotors. My Original rotors and pads still had life,  I just noticed stopping distance was increasing.
B000HACYNY|3|Broke
B007P748UO|5|Good quality. Fast shipping. Thanks
B008NO5QDQ|3|I installed this on my 2001 5.3L silverdo in conjunction with the Volant cool air intake. This product performs well when used with a cool air intake. Installation was a real pain. The spacers provided for the throttle cables were plastic and didn't even have cheap metal threads inside. Be careful tightening them up. Easy to strip out. The directions tell you to remove throttle body and then mount spacers for the throttle cables and then put the cables back on. It was easier to mount them after you mounted the throttle body spacer and throttle body. Also, the bolts provided to mount the throttle body spacer are just a bit bigger than the factory studs you will be replacing. It was not an easy fit. I was able to get 2 out of the 3 installed. The third one got stripped out. It is holding up fine with just the 2 mounting bolts holding it.
B00EFDJB8A|5|Really Wish These Came In Purple But Either Way I Still Love It. Its Exactly What I Wanted!
B00U8ETKO0|5|Great sticker
B00D42AFS8|3|THERE WAS NO APPLE CORD FOR USE IN CHARGING APPLE DEVICES. THE ONE I SAW THAT HAD THE SAME NUMBER DEVICE AS THE ONE I BOUGHT HAD A CORD FOR CHARGING APPLE DEVICES.
B00BC3726O|5|My Husband loves it!!!
B004IU7LZK|4|The rack is great. Made terrible wind noise @ 58 mph and up. I made a wind deflector. Mounted aluminum plate on the front of rack 1 inch of clearance above the roof. Plate is 12 x 45 drilled holes and fastened with nuts and bolts. No more noise, couldn't even tell it was on the car.
B00192NCSU|4|Highly recommend that you verify the part number for your vechile on Dorman's website. It took me three tries to get the right part, Amazon had a glitch in their database I guess. Once I had the right part installation was fairly simple and it worked as expected.
B000C7S0W6|5|Fits very well, have been using it for about three months. No problems. I hope it will stay this way.
B001GG2FKK|5|Nice little decal.  They fit the bill for what I wanted.
B00FJG0LU4|2|Does what it says it does, been using a white pad with it on speed setting 3 on my TORQfx buffer, no matter how small the area i buff, it seems to leave a thick trail behind that's nearly impossible to wipe off unless I spray detailed on it. Any idea why it's doing this?  The only polish it happens with
B009EPP7U0|5|Perfect fit.  Adjustable..  Can't complain
B00BCRMAAS|4|Some straps broke right of, the fit was too small for ford fusion 2012, the hooks are not turned in enough so the strings keep sliding off. Its comfortable to sit on after I finally put it on
B00J5SP6NE|5|Very good ....
B00029WVIS|5|I drive an '04 Toyota Sienna and I love these in the 2-1/2&#34; x 3-3/4&#34; size.<br /><br />Blind spot mirrors are less intuitive than the side mirrors they're stuck onto - you must actually focus your eyes into them in order for them to do you any good. Side mirrors will show you things with a simple thoughtless glance, but you bought a blind spot mirror in order to see more, in a tinier spot, and that is going to require an intentional refocus of vision. The good news is once you adjust your driving habits to include spotting two mirrors before changing lanes instead of just one, it becomes second nature. The bad news? If you don't train yourself to look at them they can't help you.<br /><br />Here's how I use mine: I apply to the inner lower corner of a side mirror. The &#34;blind spot mirror&#34; now becomes the primary mirror I use to answer the question: &#34;Are there THINGS anywhere nearby on that side? Whether it be people, cars, animals, whatever, I'll see it. I'll see it if it's right next to the van door, or if it's two lanes over. The rest of my side mirror is used to verify and confirm what &#34;things&#34; is, is doing, and how par away precisely. The rest of my side mirror is still nice for its clarity of items close to it.<br /><br />Before obtaining the blind spot mirror, entire cars would be lost in my blind spot. I tested it. Now? Nothing does. Nothing can.<br /><br />I have a spinal issue that can become aggravated with head checks. Thanks to these blind spot mirrors, head checks have become a thing of the past.<br /><br />Prior to this I drove a full size Chevy G20 van that had round blind spot mirrors that were much smaller. I used them, but couldn't trust them. These ones are large enough and clear enough that I'm confident staking my life on the information they display to me. And if that's not worthy of a 5 star rating I don't know what is.<br /><br />Only con is some people might think they feel/look cheap. I though so from the package, but on my XLE Sienna they blend right in so it doesn't bother me. Only one per package.<br /><br />I did a lot of comparison shopping before settling on this one and am glad I did! If my review was helpful to you please let me know, it makes my day! :)but on my XLE Sienna they blend right in so it doesn't bother me. Only one per package.<br /><br />I did a lot of comparison shopping before settling on this one and am glad I did! If my review was helpful to you please let me know, it makes my day! :)
B002E387KG|5|very strong
B000C5DRVW|1|Worked
B005T46060|4|The color matched but the pen part didn't work well.
B005J6JRMM|5|Fits great!
B0031GXXDG|3|It works ok, but the 3m carbon filters are better.
B00BZ0S67S|5|Used this pair of rotors on a 2003 Infiniti G35 6MT with Brembo brakes.  This is a direct fit and had no problems with installation.  Used Infiniti pads and breaking performance was unchanged.  The only difference is that Infiniti rotors cost $1K for the pair from the dealer and these were 1/3 the cost.
B00ACDP6YU|5|I purchased this for the RPM monitoring on my Honda HRX lawn mower. I adjusted the governor spring to the manual's specs and wow it cuts way better now. I didn't realize how much of a difference it would make.
B009AGER68|5|Shipped faster than expected. Love the quality. The only thing is that, it should be clear red with no white mixture on the design. It would look better if the red background of the flag remains original pure red.
B00BNIOH84|5|Smaller than first pass holder. Does great job.
B009IFIETM|3|Did not come with symbol for heated glass as described.....will return!!!
B00I548S2K|4|Perfect fit!<br />Looks great.
B00DBERFCI|1|Does not fit 2000-2004 tundra light (housing), like they said it would.... DO NOT BUY!
B00P60E276|5|Great roof rack. Sturdy, bulletproof.
B003L04MAA|5|These are excellent use them with SCCA racing a Spec Race Ford which has an open cockpit. I prefer the Thick tear offs as they protect the visor better and are easier to handle being thicker and stronger. Wish they came in a larger pack as you can easily go through 10 in a few long weekends at the track.
B0048FOLYO|5|Perfect fit would order again!
B0067UA9AS|2|NOT REALLY OEM (original equipment manufacturer)!!!  If you look the pictures closely, the square hole on the unit is about 1/3 the size as the gasket hole.  The gasket is the correct size on the engine side but the unit's hole doesn't match up. I'm certain I'll be returning this sub quality unit.  Even for the price, it's not really worth it if you have to replace again in the very NEAR future.  My original ERG lasted me 268k on my 2001 Honda Odyssey.  Using top tier gas may have helped too!  However the advertising is very misleading advertising as an OEM part.  BUYER BEWARE!!!
B0101AUG6Q|5|Go trump
B001MODCHQ|1|The hard wear sucks could use better instructions I said it was for my light bar but didn't work
B00BITJ0I0|5|Just what the doctor ordered
B0000CBJE7|5|This is my second one of these clocks. They work well and last a long time.
B00CHDFNY6|5|Good job
B002X6VXL4|5|Nice
B008UY06TS|5|This gril replacement on my 2005 Ford F 150 SuperCrew looks very clean and definitely meet my expectations... I'm definitely one to go over reviews multiple times and find them very helpful I always keep my options open and review different products before I buy any product I'm very picky and try to only choose nothing but the best this gril is a great buy for the cost and we'll meet anybody's expectations who chooses to get this product there's a little bit of work involved including cutting the old honeycomb or stock honeycomb grill out of the shell itself and fastening the new one  into place... I'm a welder so I used a grinder and a cut off wheel they suggest to use a sawzall but whatever floats your boat other than that the new grill installs very quickly and I would recommend this great product to anybody who's interested free clean looking and easy to install custom look
B002OQVDEA|5|Looks the same as the passenger side KIA factory headlight
B0002SQYUA|5|Excellent product with many automotive uses. Rugged aluminum body will ensure it holds up to shop use.
B001ARWZJG|5|very nice, haven't decided where they will go yet
B003FFP2X2|5|i needed to get the SRS light turned off on my 2000 M roadster. Searched my problem on the forums and found this product overwhelmingly the top choice. Glad I bought it. Easy to use and a well built product. (Figure I can resell it if I ever get rid of the car). Bottom line: you cannot turn off the light without fixing the problem, this tool pointed me to the problem and reset the light.
B007RVTBV4|5|Bought installed 2 sets, good
B00OJOC0O2|2|was told it would fit a honda rebel, sent it back after i realized the luggage rack mounts blocking the brake light
B00JOB793W|5|Quick shipping. A nice little inconspicuous meter to monitor the state oc charge on my old Suzuki 2Smoker. Thanks!
B00KFWZP8K|5|Very easy and fast to install and has a great low smooth sound and 10 times lighter then factory muffler and well worth the money
B0067BPC68|5|works
B00BJNNNQU|4|works OK, made the lenses a little clearer but may need new ones anyway. had a few spots where it looks like the protection is completely off.
B00FTAZ8C6|4|They are good quality with the right fit and they worked great
B00B7SJIC0|5|Perfect! Genuine Nissan Part. Just what I needed. In case you aren't sure or inclined in the automotive department, the handles are made of mostly plastic and tend to break over time with extensive use. easy fix though total of 6 screws. Need a 10mm socket and if you have a convertible like mine you will need a torx set too. Takes about 30 minutes if you are good with tools.
B00BAZBXTG|5|looks good
B0073WEZU4|5|For the fast service but hated the antenna look like poop on my truck :( I am returning .
B000C822QU|3|While the cap was delivered quickly and does fit it is not a direct replacement. The outside diameter is larger than the OEM cap on my Acura making the tether unusable.
B008FCE948|5|They worked like I expected. It worked great
B008NYL80G|5|Extremely pleased with this little antenna!!! A few weeks ago, someone stole the original antenna that came with my clubman. Thought I was gonna have to &#34;pony it up&#34; and purchase a new one straight from the local dealership. OUCH!!! This little guy showed up in great packaging that included 2 different screw sizes to ensure that it would fit properly on my vehicle. Away I go...<br />By the way, my radio reception is excellent and the price I paid for this OEM from the MINI dealership in San Francisco was outstanding!!! Thank you for making stock available on Amazon.
B00FBKWBIS|5|Super bright,  got the 12000k purple hid's abs live them. Will definitely recommend this product.
B000K03TGM|5|It took care of the problem.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Worked as expected and brought back two dead battery's my other charger would not.
B000C5UF8A|5|Great fit right on thks
B00QNUO7FK|5|Very nice towels. Good quality.
B00A8NTOZQ|4|Works great!!! Only problem it's aluminum not hard enough to survive if someone hits you.
B00T6YAJKW|3|Color is red, picture shows orange. Doesn't look good with with blue LEDs. Metal feels like good quality but turning the light on feels cheap and the button gets stuck easily when turning the light on.
B000BG1X54|5|Best siphon I ever had. I use it to change the water in my aquarium. It takes less than 5 minutes to drain. 30+ gallons. Saves me a half hour each time.
B00E2D1BQS|5|Got here really fast !!! Plug right inworks great!!!!😀
B0051BKZLW|4|They fit the bolt hole was out to far out wouldn't bolt up without have my rims are U2 35 22's by 9.5
B00CLSWFAM|4|Works as expected.  As long as the electric jack does its job this shouldn't be needed.  But it gives peace of mind for the unexpected.
B008BG60XG|5|Delivery was quick and the liner is durable.  A perfect fit!
B007JOVP90|5|Perfect design, fast shipping.<br />Thank you so much !!! ❤
B00UW1T31Y|5|Excellent value. 80% less than most local auto stores. Fit perfectly on my 1998 carry. Great value!
B002J8379C|3|they are disposable after 3 or 4 uses
B00H007TWA|4|Came here fast. I loved that. Great product for the price. Love the colors and designs.. Gave my car a much better look.
B00BLN48NK|2|First of all the product itself is great.  Heavy duty for sure.  Now for the description on what exactly it fits was veague. Does not work with all e-trak systems. Only you don't find this out till its too late.  In order to get a refund you loose $60 because of the weight to ship it and restalking fee.
B007WR25GG|5|Very sturdy and waterproof car top carrier. Just tried it out for a trip from Virginia to Maine. Traveled great, took about 10-15 minutes to secure to the rails (my husbands' words), and packs up very compact in a drawstring bag after use.  It held 3 medium & 1 large LL Bean duffle bags and 2 smaller sized duffle bags with plenty more room to spare. I only used the LL Bean Duffle Bag reference for the bag sizing if you want to look them up.  No complaints.
B0050LU2GQ|5|These are a great idea.  Keeps the laminated cardboard placard from getting all wonky.
B00EDFM7DQ|5|I installed these in my camper.  These led bulbs are slightly brighter than the OEM bulbs.  The led bulbs are substantially cooler than the OEM bulbs.  So, you won't have to replace the clear domes and you don't have to listen to a noisy converter.
B00N48RB70|5|bright as my buddies rigid.. okay not quite but its as bright as a 40&#34; opt7 bar.
B00EN6U2A0|1|This Harken 2-Point Hoist requires  you to mount a bracket to the wall, that extends a distance which is at least as long as the lift. So if you have a 12' kayak, and lift it 10' to the ceiling, you need to extend the wall bracket 10'. That means you need 10' + 12' of distance, or 22'. Disappointed, I returned the Harkin Hoist. Instead I purchase a RAD kayak hoist, which is far less expensive. It works so well, that I purchased a second RAD kayak hoist.
B00KRT779G|5|Nice tool set I just  bought this same set at sears and it was only $150 there
B009PDBPTS|5|It was easy to program and I didn't have to pay $80 at a dealership.. I mean it isn't new. But for $5 I am not complaining
B0054T9W0G|5|This is what I was looking for.
B00NEU440K|5|Great  small buffing kit I really like it. Good selection of agressevness
B00DENSJZS|5|Good back up lights they are very bright
B000C9S4RU|5|Looks different than original,  but fits and works good
B004ZO3VN0|3|Meh what can I say.  Its ok i guess.  Running 91 octane vs running a blend that should have been around 103-105 octane I didnt notice any difference on my turbo 1.4 cruze.  No mileage increase no power increase I could tell.
B006K8VTAQ|5|Perfect
B004A8Q5UC|1|AC Delco dropped the ball in my opinion on these.  These are cheap AND they are cheap. Should have known but was relying on the name to be a quality item.  Boy was I wrong. They should send the entire lot back and take their name off of junk like this and rebrand them as Tempfix, cause that's what it will be... a temp fix. The Terminals on battery ends are open to the air and not sealed. Ask any mechanic in the northeast or near the shore how well that will work in a year.  Maybe they will be fine in the desert. They, should be molded to the cable like the OEM is.  Why do you think the OEM's have the rubber also sealing to the side battery? That's right to keep the air and moisture out!  These terminal covers work like an umbrella at best.  The Switch end is nothing more than stripped wire stuck into a cheap round tube and crushed flat with a hole drilled thru it.  Can you get any cheaper guys?  The factory is soldered first and then crimped with a REAL terminal that's also equipped with an anti-rotational finger. These are right up there with crap you buy from the local guys that have &#34;pro-rated&#34; the 4 &#34;lifetime warranty&#34; alternators you had to replace in 2 years.  Come on garbage is garbage.  I sent it back after seeing it.  Can you tell I was disappointed?<br />Found new old stock to replace. Folks if you buy junk they will only make and sell junk. Stop buying junk.
B001PNHB9O|5|Very strong build switch and nice thick wire ..
B00J036R3M|1|Don't waste your money. Cheap chinese bulb, one lasted ~2 months and the other dies shortly after.
B00HYHXEEG|5|Fit perfect.  No slip.  Trunk tray especially handy.  I prefer this over my other car's weather tech!

B000C33LR4|1|Does not fit 2001 VW Cabrio - claims it does, but it doesnt.  Now I can't return it either.  Ripped off
B00BYNJ7OW|5|Great product
B0024E6V30|5|It was the right one
B000Q9CQW0|1|I bought four of these and ONE of them &#34;inflated&#34; fully - the way it should.  The other three degraded to varying degrees from there, down to only 1/4 or 1/5 full.  Incredibly disappointed in the quality control concerning this product.  I bought mine at Academy for under $4.00 - three will be going back to the store.  I haven't actually tried the one that soaked in the water yet, but I'm guessing it's fine from what the other reviewers have to say.<br /><br />Not sure if this matters at all, but I bought the camo (the worst), the white with black detail (the best) and two of the blue with white detail (both landed in between).
B0083TYGSW|3|returned  -didn't fit as snugly as I had expected. Nice feel and well made - just wasn't' what I was looking for.
B0033DMGP8|5|Actual gates kit that has the good belt. 05 OB XT limited 2.5T.
B004WEHC3I|5|This vital protection cream, along with the Leather Masters Cleaner, works fantastic on my old leather couches!  They almost look new!
B01264D2DY|5|It not only works on atvs but I love it on my out door grill what I like best was the price and quality.  By johlibb
B001OBB1CA|1|I ordered this part because it was offered by a supposedly &#34;reputable&#34; brake manufacturer and because I needed an OEM caliper with the same materials and design so I would only have to replace the one caliper where the parking brake mechanism was no longer working which would prevent the vehicle from passing my state inspection.<br /><br />This product is NOT prepared properly and could lead to serious injury or death when installed. The brake lines on many VWs (including the 2003 Passat for which I ordered this) DO NOT have removable crush washers. They are an integrated part of the hose (which costs over $65 at a dealer.) Although the unit ships with new copper washers, they can't be used in this application. The mfr SHOULD know this. These copper washers are softer than the VW specified mild steel washers and there's a good reason for this. The &#34;banjo&#34; bolt connection where the brake hose meets the caliper is sealed purely by torquing to bolt to the proper value (35 N-m or 28 ft-lbs), however because Raybestos PAINTED THE VALVE SEAT leaving it non-uniform and rough, a proper seal can't be achieved. This results in a slowly leaking connection which could eventually fail and have dire consequences. Even if the copper washers could be used, they might only allow the integrity of this seal to be maintained for some short period of time.<br /><br />I've included photos of what this BAD valve seat looks like as well as what it SHOULD look like from the original caliper I removed from the car.
B00AMPJ3D8|5|Easy to install. Requires a small flat head screw driver to remove clip(s).
B00AV8HKCM|5|Works good picks up my 84 cr250 easy
B00THR39SC|2|The box it came in was trashed on arrival. The flares themselves included the attaching plastic fasteners. The finish was a flat black smooth finish, ready to be prepped for paint or just installed, if you decide not to paint be warned you can clearly see different color tones in the plastic from the original molding. The flares themselves fit just &#34;OK&#34;. Don't fool yourself, these are not GM flares and do not fit like GM flares, but are way way cheaper than GM flares..so you get what you pay for.
B008PYZ210|5|Ordered these not that long ago and they arrived sooner than expected, they came in indivual small plastic bags tied at the top and inside this yellow envelop with bubble wrap for protection :) They are cute Lol and all like new, definitely recommend buying this package, since right now its on a special price it's a deal and even more worth it. Also No broken pieces and no missing pieces.
B0057GWP6Y|5|Awesome! Not exactly as shown in the picture. It says Jack where the red swirl is but it still looks great.
B0043DL8NS|5|I’m swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and needed to replace the exhaust from the engine to the muffler… the rest was replaced not too long ago. I was hoping that it would be an easy 3” ID into a 3” OD and I was wrong. The Walker 15034 converter I was installing had a 3” ID on both ends which was fine for the exhaust pipe from the manifold but that left me with my Dynomax 42606 connector pipe slipping into the converter rather than the other way around… the connector pipe was needed to make up the difference with the shorter length of the converter to what was there previously. I tried SmartParts 300300 3&#34; lap joint on the Walker exhaust side but the pipe was thick and it wouldn’t work get a tight fit so I cut a 5-inch length of pipe to slip in as a nipple; added some Permatex 80335 Sealer; butted the pipes together; and then installed the clamp again and all is good. I had to cut four slits into the converter and use a compression clamp on the engine side. I used the SmartParts 320300 3&#34; lap joint but on the extension pipe to the muffler and that was easy. My first time using this type of clamp and it was a mistake not trying them earlier. I couldn’t get the old converter off the Walker 44461 Extension Pipe so I ended up have to cut it and it was buggered that I ended up replacing it because I couldn’t get a new pipe far enough into it to prevent it from leaking… the old clamp had made an indentation on the top that prevented the pipe from going all the way. Good news is if I ever need to pull it apart connectors that don’t distort the pipes will make it easy. Since this was all one pain in the butt project the review is for everything I used. Everything was a quality product I have to go with 5-stars for them all. However, not all clamps fit 3” ID pipe like that on my converter, especially those from SmartParts, but the Dynomax 35794 3” clamps were a perfect fit. I cut slits in the pipe to get a better compression but a little torque would have worked but might have made the pipe bend and be difficult to impossible to get off if ever needed. Welding just wasn’t an option for me.ve worked but might have made the pipe bend and be difficult to impossible to get off if ever needed. Welding just wasn’t an option for me.
B009DJU978|5|works great! great price!
B000CFQ30O|5|Fits great works like it should
B001F0IE7A|4|As advertised and rec'd quickly as well.
B00B2AG380|5|I love it just need the rest of the system to complete
B008LUXS3M|5|I installed these in my 2011 F150 XLT Ecoboost. I ran a wire from the battery then behind the tail light of the passenger side, through the little hole inside the bed and installed a aircraft rocker switch so it wont get damaged on the inside. These lights really made my workable at night. I always get comments when I have them on in the parking lot while loading stuff. Battle Tested, 5 Stars
B00OPMIR2M|5|Get this! Once i used this, i refuse to buy a different gauge.
B0071I3218|4|it's good according to the price and wish if they had my car's color
B005I4DNZ2|1|Was recommended by the website, and I didn't need it. So I spent extra money for nothing.
B00RDMBTNA|5|Wish I've been using these years ago. Never again will I use rags or brushes. This is the only way to go.
B00Z11351O|4|Smaller than expected. Looks good
B007EA6R0Q|5|Bought this to replace a Graber trunk bike rack witch worked very well.  Anyway this bike rack is built very tough and operates very easy. The only thing I think you would need to know is with this rack and ones like it you need to have the top cross bar to put the bikes on this on it.  Also it has the narrowing tubes for the rack so lets say more than 3 adult bikes I would recommend a different rack with straight bike hanging tubes.  Other than that the bike holders work good and don't leave any marks or anything and are fairly easy to use.
B00KTAUK3S|5|Excellent !!! customer service also
B0068G18E2|1|delivery was great as always at amazon product was not up to standards have been trying to resolve with manufacturer spring not heavy enough for my ultra with my wife and I riding ,I weigh 230 my wife 125 ,bottoms out they say should be fine ,tried several adjustments,do have experience with shocks,not getting it done, dave  r
B00GCBPI9E|5|Got here quickly, high quality product and it looks great on my hitch.  Thanks!
B00BABAOVI|5|Came quickly and looks great! Very happy with it.
B004A6JA2O|5|I received in good condition. The filter is well constructed and fit perfectly. I have not noticed any of the charcoal odors others mentioned and will purchase another for next year's maintenance.
B008VO5Z7K|5|They came at a good price and I'm very pleased with them.
B004JHBKLS|5|delivered as promised
B001JDE6ZW|5|great optics, built well
B00I3KCEO4|4|No problems with it, the holes were just a tiny bit off for my car but no enough that they wouldn't work.
B00630NZAS|5|Arrived on time and the keyless remote is brand new and works great.
B00FZOFDGC|4|Mounted easily, however we needed to buy the screws to attach the actual license plate, and it seemed a bit over-priced.
B0002JM69W|1|Not that good. Doesn't hold up well. Starts falling apart with regular use.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|These car mats are good quality. Thicker than my michelin mat.<br /><br />Few reviews mentioned the smell, I was little worried when I order, but the price is too good to beat, so I gave it a try. The mats I received just has regular car mat smell, it is not strong, I can smell it when I was cutting it out of the package, cause my nose is right next to it. Once installed in car, I cant smell it any more.<br /><br />The mats was purchased for my husband's VW Jatte, and it fits nicely, I have to trim the the gas paddle side a little bit, but that is with every mat I brought, so not an issue. I steal the back seat mat for my Honda Odessy, it fits nicely as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend these mats.
B00GM4WKJM|5|Can't beat for the price.  I recommend for anyone needing to drive a dog to and from the dog park.  You're pup can have all the fun of getting incredibly dirty and not have to worry about keeping your SUV clean. It is easy to remove and clean, which also keeps your SUV clean.
B002INQ434|1|I wasn't indicated that's an antifreeze and water wetter combined
B000VWK4UI|4|works
B00BFDJCPA|5|Replaced the original on my 2003 Honda Civic EX.  The original didn't seal due to shrinkage and hardening of the rubber stopper.  This fit perfectly, and makes me feel better about having a dirt and moisture free transmission!
B00BA54QH2|5|Matched paint exactly and the fit was perfect for my new 2015 Prius. They do not send enough adhesive promoter so I purchased 1 package from NAPA Auto Parts, part# 06396 for $2.70 plus tax.  I measured and applied blue painters tape per the instructions.  Then I measured down 1 1/4&#34; and applied another length of blue painters tape so I would know exactly where to put the adhesive promoter, masking in the pointed ends so I would not get any beyond where the molding would go.  Then after applying the promoter, I took off the bottom tape.  Took off the red at the pointed end along with about 6&#34; at that end, took off 12&#34; at the blunt end. Started at blunt end per instructions and just kept pulling red tape and gently pressing molding on making sure I was lined up with bottom of tape. This was SO EASY and quick to install.  Toyota wanted $209 for these moldings.  I saved over 57%.
B003AOI77Q|5|Worked just as described, If you have converted your 4.2L to aluminum valve cover, this is the best gasket to use for it.
B0016ISET4|5|The AC compressor work beautiful thank you sir
B00K35ZRMI|1|it dose not work leaks around the nut in the back on the bottom that looks like it has two little holes in it
B00FY7XJV6|5|Perfect swapout.  Well worth the price.
B00E1SLWTA|5|Great product and arrived quickly.
B0006FKFMC|3|Ordered this to see if I can pull the little ding on the side of my car .The device look sturdy however the glue that came with the device is not strong enough to adhere to the puller. The glue sticks pretty good on the car but If you can find a stronger glue this should work. It didn't work for me.
B00JXC98EA|5|Good product well built working good just plug and play no wire stripping
B000WMO0ZC|5|Motul....Ester based...what more do you need to know?  Running in my Super Duke with excellent results.
B00LDNH3EE|5|God products come with everything you need to upgrade you lights solid built
B00SNQ57TC|4|Fit is good for the Juke except for the back head rests. Way to big in that department. Having to cut the fabric to allow for the seat belts is definitely not an optimal situation aesthetically.
B0009IQXXG|5|Good
B009G5IXVS|3|Great wheel covers but did not fit my year honda.
B00684TIVE|4|Good product did what it supposed to do and easy instructions to follow
B007P05FBW|5|Fit great. Worked finw
B009FU6T7E|5|I added the Bilstein shocks to the front of my truck (2010 GMC 1500 4x4) at the 70k mile mark.  My truck would bounce while going over any bump since I had it.  I wish I would had replaced the OEM shocks as soon as I got my truck.  The ride is perfect now, no bouncing, and less body roll. I would recommend getting a shock nut tool to help tighten down the nut when the strut is reassembled.
B002UC4P2U|1|One of the 2 bulbs was dead within 24 hours. Will never buy this brand again.
B00D9C2CDO|3|Used it for one 2000 mile trip. Had a few summer showers and the luggage got a little wet. The material is pretty thin but the price isn't out of line for what you get. The zippers and tie downs worked well. At the end of trip I noticed a few holes that had been worn into the bag from vibration. I used it in a basket, not on luggage rack bars. Cheap but you pay for what you get.
B004GCKY9A|5|Fit just right. The plastic rod holders are not very good, so save your old ones. Make sure you have the handle in the &#34;unlocked position&#34; when you install the handle or it won't install correctly.
B001SG8ZC0|5|This item worked great.  I used this to bleed a step bore master cylinder for an 1988 Chevy pickup.  The threads were different on the two holes so I was able to use two different adapters from the one kit.  I did use teflon pipe thread tape to make sure I had a good seal.  I am not sure why everyone thinks you need clear tubing.  If you follow the directions on the kit it is pretty obvious when you have purged all the air from the system.  This made the job super easy and it only took minutes.  In fact, I probably took twice as long as I needed just to make sure.  Remember not to pump too fast or you may aerate the brake fluid.  I pumped once every 30 seconds for 10 minutes and was getting nothing but fluid after 5.  You WILL see the difference between when there is air in the system and when there is not.
B0090Q35CU|5|Love it
B00SUNH7GY|4|Fast delivery. Easy to install
B00RDODSF0|4|Easy installation, great design and look good once installed.
B0002SA40Q|5|easy fit
B007KTINZ8|5|Great value!
B00E9HTM0Y|5|I wish I ordered more of them!
B000IOHHEA|4|The hint of chrome looks good with the all black f6b.
B00NPRMW1A|5|perfect!  gave a few as gifts!  better to be safe than sorry!
B001DX9UM2|5|This part fixed my temp gauge problem and was easy to install
B002NAS052|5|Thank you can't believe it came in that fast. And it fit perfect on my car. Thank you again.
B00M1WDCR8|4|Doesn't fit fatter steering wheels very well
B010W2NDWC|5|Perfect fit, great price thank you, I will do business with you again. .
B002UD0GFE|5|This stuff is great for the windshields of touring motorcycles. Just finished a 3 wee tour of Colorado, Wyoming and Montana and it cleans the bugs and road grime right off no problem. Don't leave home without it!
B0009V1WS4|4|Seems to work great so far.
B000CO9IC0|5|Good
B00J00X3NW|5|Great price..good oil..also got extend oil filter.
B00QYPY92K|1|It didn't work
B000S0H2A8|1|Warning:<br /><br />These are $18 Glasspacks, which are NOT MUFFLERS, and NOT STREET LEGAL.<br /><br />BE WARNED!!!<br /><br />They are Flow-though muffler wannabes. They are NOT DESIGNED to Muffle Sound.<br />Not Worth the Money, to get a big 'ol fat ticket from a Trigger-happy Cop.
B006VN3GHY|5|Installed easily in about 15 minutes on my 2012 Nissan Xterra. Everything went together as it should and it works fine.
B005IV1BTA|3|Not bad..but not bright enough
B000EPWDU6|1|Bought for a 1994 Geo Tracker. It has larger wire connectors than oem connection. Did not work.
B001AIZ5HY|3|ok for price
B008JYXYNY|5|Great product!
B00J09FKN4|5|Excellent quality ...
B000V4YJ3Y|5|Fit my 1992 Civic LX perfectly. Now they might not be uber-performance brake shoes, but then again, it's a Civic... and it's drum brakes. Neither of those things scream high performance. They work, better than the ones that were there before, and since they're rear drums, they're liable to last forever.
B00VHQF0TC|1|Received ripped
B004GA1LE4|4|If you don't want to buy an $80 VW original then Dorman is your next best choice.
B00H9S71LW|5|Very nice
B00P8YHRPO|3|Ok
B007WIDKV4|5|Perfect fit
B0020MVNJS|4|They are up and growing fast. Thank you.
B00CBY013O|5|There great with my EVS netted riding shorts, when standing up the air is there keeping the jewels cool.<br />Like riding nakid but with protection.<br />Note I use strap on knee pads and add on hip pads not included<br />I have the dacar pants also they are better below 80 deg. F, I wear these for 80 deg. F and up
B00FDBQZCS|5|Very bright very nice kit
B00K889FCI|3|It helps, but its not the miracle magic potion they claim it is. I have a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee which has fairly faded/cloudy lenses. After following the directions TO A TEE and darn near dislocating my elbows from all the wet-sanding, the lenses look improved from before but nowhere near clean and clear. Is it worth the ten bucks? Sure, I suppose. Just don't expect like-new headlights as the advertising would have you believe. I still think they look like crap, even if slightly less crappy than before.
B003940OO6|4|NICE NOZZEL SET BUT HAVING TROUBLE SHETHING THE WATER SO NO SPOTS OCCUR.
B00P2D3VZG|3|Works like a light bulb, but cost too much. Where does the manufacture come up with a price point for these and all of the Philips led bulbs? They do the same thing as any other bulb, Philips led bulbs are over rated. I would rather buy a incandescent bulb for .99 cents and keep replacing it when it goes out. So you save 50 cents on electricity but the house bulbs are $20+ dollars upfront. But it will last a lifetime they say, and It's just not for me.
B00EYVJUAW|3|It appears to be a good strong quality. The only problem I have is that the snap on Pin is a little too heavy or strong. it takes a bit of effort to get it it in the  bolt
B0041Q0Z7M|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B00RZZA6ZW|5|Great..
B00379ABX2|5|We actually have it on film where a person (ex con, on probation) came to the door, spotted the sign and dropped his head and quickly left.
B00X9LQ6F0|3|Very cheaply made.
B005XZQHA4|2|Thought I had peace of mind when using this with my helmet, but after it being in a well lit parking lot at a Red Robin for only an hour I came back to the lock being cut in half and my helmet gone. The nylon isn't hard to cut through, and clearly the cable isnt that hard either.
B00XBLGGOE|5|Great steps.
B002IWZSPU|5|I don't have to shove my power cord into the rv anymore. I just unplug it from the rv.
B001W0A5AC|5|No complaints. Brakes work and these seem to be near Oem quality. I recently inspected them  seem that there was no issues. I install EBC green stuff pads with them on a 2006 Ford Focus zx3.
B00EZ9Y33W|5|Very easy to install, the exposed part of the cable to elements is protected by a black hose, the other part is supposed to be placed inside the vehicle, Switch works ok, maybe you will prefer a higher quality one. I used it in my nissan xtrail to connect two led fog lights, cable is largely enough
B000WK4CS4|5|Quick shipment, quality product. I have used Yuasa batteries before and find them to be the best choice.
B00I551I1W|5|Very satisfied with the delivery timing and the product itself.
B000W952DE|5|Works great  exact part that came with the truck no more  check engine light. Did not even have to jack truck up  electrical connector on outside of frame  The sensor on the other side used a 7/8 wrench pop right off  use anti-seize compound I knew part
B000BWGLRS|3|The strap broke within 3 days
B000C2UE02|5|Works great.
B002EOVDII|2|THis wouldn't work with the phone that had an otterbox, so I never used it.  And that made it....useless.
B00SG9D57W|5|Everything worked as it should....
B002N5W8Q4|1|I just threw this fan into the garbage where it belongs. The idea is great and when the fan worked it definitely made our refrigerator more efficient. The problem is in the design of this fan.  First and foremost the battery compartment is way too small. I had to practically pound the batteries into it to be able to put the bottom cover back on. Then when it became necessary to replace the batteries, pry them out with a screwdriver. I millimeter or two bigger would have made it so much easier.  After the first month or so the fan developed a wobble such that when it was in contact with anything in the refrigerator it made an annoying buzzing sound. The final straw was just now when I went to replace the batteries and it refused to work. Even using a tester to insure battery contact I was unable to get the fan to turn. Evidently the motor decided it had reached the end it's lifespan in just a few months. Bottom line: the idea behind the fan is good but I'll be looking for something that is built better. Don't waste your money on this product.
B00FRHOMNM|3|Amazon says it fits my ML350 2013 model - it did not - i had to use a knife and take a notch out of the plastic to make it work.
B0002KR88A|5|Works as advertised...
B000KIMHRQ|5|This is a great quality multimeter. I succeeded in diagnosing the errant starter by checking the voltage and cranking voltage of the battery, then measuring the drain on the battery (only 3 milliamps, which is fine), which led to the starter. I got it replaced today and car starts up great!.
B00PLFX2UY|1|Zipper broke on first use.
B00OUZCWAW|5|Works great to help silence my garage door. Nice long spray stem to reach the places high up that need application. For chain-drive opener owners, you shouldn't spray this on the chain directly--there's a special grease you should use for that.
B0092R7O8I|1|Stupid reusable cup idea shoots good other then that. Can't find a regular use 20 ounce cup
B008M1WB7E|4|They fit pretty good. Been using them for the past few months only complaint is when you get inside the back floor storage boxes the liner stabs you.
B008G3KG2U|4|great for the price.
B0040IV0Y8|1|I bought two hubcaps in the last month or so & ended up losing both of them within a day each. I won't by another until I figure out if either it is the hubcap failure or maybe the lug bolts that are causing the loss.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|I have a 2014 F150 and this shade fits to the windshield and also easy to carry at side of door.
B000BQRQSM|5|Fits our 2004 Highlander perfectly. We bought it as we just canceled our garbage pick-up and will be using this vehicle to transport the garbage. We haven't had any spills yet, but we have no reason to believe the liner won't work to keep spills off of the carpet.
B000E3CYBQ|5|great
B000JJOGHK|5|Fit just as expected. the sticky things were difficult to get on, but now my dash dont rattle so I'm happy!
B0002MG9T2|5|Easy to install and fits any drink....actually installed it on a tool box on my truck.
B000ARPVOI|5|i don't know how this greasy goo works but it does. And my mpg proves this goo's price breaks even with improved mpg even if gas drop to 2.99 /gallon
B00UCXOJG6|5|Good belt good price fast and free shipping
B00JIEX722|5|Extremely happy with these. Had bought cheap LEDs in the past and got cheap LEDs that burnt out in a week. These are super bright and very good quality. Will buy again.
B00FQ0Q8U0|4|the window washer fluid does not spray out like the oem more of a straight line down instead of fanning out.  Otherwise it does its job
B00NIHI5Y0|5|Working perfectly fine. Great buy.
B000VLF9NQ|5|Works and fits perfectly on my 2002 Wrangler softtop
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Works good on a 2012 BMW X5 reverse light no errors.
B009DK1X7M|5|I do like it is perfect place to order staf
B001C3XC86|5|Great product. Exactly what the listing said.  Was in great shape upon arrival. Product fit perfectly. Would buy this item again.
B0009NZL34|4|Working well so far. We have it on the back of our class a motorhome and the bikes do not bounce at all.
B00V7AVUBA|5|I've been tinkering with my rides since the good old swap meet days. I've never purchased an add on/accessory for any of my vehicles that fit so well, had all the parts, or instructions worth a hoot.<br /><br />The instructions were great. Everything which needed to be labeled was labeled very clearly. They topology very little time to put on and they look great! I will recommend these to everyone.
B00651CIGM|4|Works at least 90% as good as stock antenna on 2011 Jeep JK
B00CYU9DF2|5|working good
B00063Y1F6|1|Worked great for two 5/32&#34; aluminum rivets while redoing the decking on my kayak.  After that it would collapse the rivet as normal but snap it 1/2&#34; from the end leaving the tool stuck to the rivet (& kayak).  I was able to break the rivet free and then put the nozzle in a vise to gently tap the remaining stem out.  No amount of adjusting or cleaning ever got it to work right again.  Made in Taiwan.
B0039ZOONW|5|good experience
B00JJYP9AO|4|Fast shipping , very easy to install , looks good and is functional
B006N97JCY|4|The bushings in the skit or not read their black. They look like they're your thing. They say made in the USA on them. It was cheaper than buying one from the dealer
B00FDQPCR2|5|We bought this for our shed. It works great and the light is super bright. Gonna buy a second one for our house.
B00029XHZ4|5|Great product, sounds so good!
B00407V4JU|2|Was not a &#34;perfect match&#34; for my VW GTI 2006 2.0L vehicle with &#34;Reflex Silver&#34; paint.  eventually just got my car repainted professionally.
B00Y4NQ4T0|3|Brake light looks cool but the light for the bed isn't bright at all
B003YF2EWK|5|easy to use. great maintenance tool to check wear with.
B00T47KYZ6|1|It is not cooling, just fan and it is smaller than the picture.
B001IV1KRC|1|I looked at all the reviews, because it's critical that I have a reliable bilge pump switch. My boat stays anchored in 10 feet of fresh clean water in the summertime while I am away from it for weeks at a time. I have a battery tender to always maintain proper battery voltage. I researched as many bilge pump switches which I could find based on reliability, and chose this one. I really do miss the old foolproof mercury switches, but that is another story for another day. I haven't had this switch for one year yet, and it already failed and sunk my boat. I recovered my boat and have made all of the necessary repairs to the engine, electrical system and other things. I took the bilge pump switch out and then took it apart. Inside I discovered a very rudimentary, crude and less than reliable microswitch at the heart of the electrical matter. This is a microswitch which would be suitable for a limiting switch for an automobile sunroof or electric seat, but certainly not anything more than one amp of electrical current at 12 volts. This is from a guy who has been an ASE/L1 master technician for more than 40 years and has been working on 12 V electrical systems professionally almost every day in that time. I know quality electrical components and I know junk. This is junk.
B009RP9K78|5|I bought these to replace a &#34;Roached Out&#34; pair of 1997 AS Mick Doohan replica boots. After donating them to the local landfill for low income RAT Habitat, I decided to purchase these. I went with the Euro Size Chart & they were &#34;Dead On&#34; for size! Kudos to AS for making them in a 10.5! The comfort level is superb as well as the style! I went with the Black & White pair because they resemble a real swell set of Bowling Shoes! I put them on & headed down to the local Lanes to roll a few frames. Not only did I save $5.00 on shoe rental, I wasn't even questioned about them by bowling alley officials. Many proficient league players (Capable of rolling a 280+ game on ANY given night) remarked about the &#34;Toe Sliders&#34; and asked what they were for? I told them they were on there to keep the Laser Foul beam sensor from being scuffed should I botch up the &#34;Flying Eagle&#34; trick shot. The fact that they go very well with my &#34;Joe Rocket&#34; Leathers with white accents is just an added bonus feature. I have no doubt that these will last as long as my last pair of alpine stars boots did given the fact of more modern day materials used today vs. 1997. Put them on and wear them anywhere.
B000YC5ID8|5|aok
B0076PKGC4|5|Perfect! Pretty easy to install.
B00D42AFS8|2|It did not hold a charge above 20 - 40% beyond 1 or 2 weeks. It was reputed to hold 60% or better for up to 6-months! It is a nicely consolidated unit with multiple charging possibilities. I would have been impressed had everything worked as advertised.
B000E300OE|5|Perfect fit!
B00PV9B4FU|5|Nice cute work out well
B0007WJRF0|4|Time will tell how durable it is.  Looks like it will do the job for the time being.  A little wide on the rear of a Tacoma box, but that is to be expected with most covers.  Easy installation.
B000778LCU|5|These are working very well, I bought two of these in case I destroy one somehow for a backup, for the price what can go wrong?
B00Y9Z9846|2|Although the lights are nice and bright the operation function is not well thought out. These lights have a chip controlled algorithm that is too crazy. The lights flash and do spiral designs on one of the input legs. You'd think that might be for the brake light leg but you can't tell what's going on when you have the turn signal on... is it the signal or the light flashing? Add to that the other leg, which does just come on solidly, is much brighter so using the algorithm leg for brake lights doesn't work as the algorithm is drowned out by the brighter solid leg. But using the algorithm lef for marker/tail lights is just a crazy display... worse than driving with your flashers on. I guess if you want people to notice you as you drive down the road (and likely piss them off at night) this would be the light for you.
B0052FRPLK|5|A+++++
B00F9EDP90|5|Bike started up immediately after install. I hope 3 or 4 years down the road I happy then too. So far so good. Engine turns over fast when starting.
B002R12HZG|1|Was not the right part for a YJ.
B00CD2RBZ0|5|Look good and fit good. Thanks
B000GZI24K|5|Looks fantastic, fits great, would purchase again
B0089Q9GOS|4|Great shield. Does NOT fit seven zero seven backlash though. Had to return.
B000BZEH3A|5|These sensor worked great on my c5 corvette and I've had them on for 2 years now still going strong
B001EOV492|5|No problems identified.  Seems fine.
B00DLMGH0Q|3|Work well but the extension for them suck really bad they both aren't fully functional one burned out and the other turns on when it warm enough
B00278MDFS|5|Filters air like it's supposed to. Perfect fit
B004VNJZVW|2|To big didn't use
B000VKRQ7O|5|For my 2013 Accent, I've found this filter to be much better AND CHEAPER than the dealer's.
B008IMGWMM|4|Sounds great and not just for the price.  IMO you have to turn off MDS with a tuner for optimal sound.  I also had to put a 2 in rubber mount between the x pipe and frame because of vibration.  I just need to find tips that will fit this system.<br /><br />Btw it's very difficult to remove the old exhaust with the fake oem exhaust tips. I took mine off and it came out easy. Looks better with out the oem but like u said I need to find tips now. And because this setup is about 5 inches short at the rear.
B00UUSMPJG|1|To expensive for 1 light
B000WJ87PY|5|Cute but didn't fit my 2015 Toyota Corolla, therefore gave it to my mom instead (2006 Toyota Sienna). Can't go wrong with Hello Kitty. It's super comfortable and the grip is great! The colors haven't worn out either.
B000BRCKTG|4|Fits
B000FKBQFS|4|Tight fit with the blower and a 3 core radiator.  The biggest problem is the overflow bottle fit.  The factory bottle does not have enoughroom because the lower radiator hose, and rubs the factory hood.
B005U9JH6O|5|Perfect!
B00WAORZM0|5|nice product! Pricing was great and fast shipping!
B0055AZ42Y|5|SERIOUSLY good quality for the money was my initial impression!
B00ACMF53S|5|Tits man
B00ENJIWIG|5|Looks great. Delivered fast in a factory Subaru bag with correct part number. Fits 02-07 WRX factory 2.5&#34; midpipe.
B00BTGDR9A|5|Just what I wanted and ontime
B00LOZCBU2|2|Colors dull / not vibrant / disappointing
B0023VKVV2|5|It was perfect. My husband was really happy with it.
B002SQXK60|2|take the problem to your local shop, this helped a little but still difficult
B002P8SO26|5|Excellent and fast shipping
B003UT090Y|4|A little bit goes a long way and it work real good.
B000C10E1W|1|If at all possible, avoid buying this boot.  It is not a quick boot by any means.  The time that it will take to properly install this thing is longer than removing the axle and installing a new axle.  But if you are a glutton for punishment, and decide to buy this thing, here are some tips that may help you.  First and foremost keep in mind that it is a \\"universal\\" boot so it fits hundreds of different cars.  With that in mind, some minor trimming and such will probably be in order.  Remove the boot from the box and test fit it on your axle.  This way you will know if any trimming is necessary.  Once you are done with that, thoroughly clean it with brake cleaner in case you got any grease on it.  Then glue 1 side and let it sit for 24 hours.  After 24 hours the glue will be set and then some.  Take boot and install on your cars axle.  Now glue the other side and let sit for 24 hours.  By doing this way you avoid getting any grease or other contaminants on the boot and preventing the glue from bonding.  Now  you can pack the bearing with the supplied grease.  Position the boot in the correct location and install the clamps.  The clamps that come with the boot are inadequate, if you have room install hose clamps or nylon zip ties to keep the boot in place. If you take your time, keep everything clean and let the glue set up you will have a successful installation.  Good luck
B000Z0HVHA|5|Just what I expected.
B00LM56CFY|5|I use these in my home and car.  Love them and many friends have expressed their like for them also.
B005VUPH5C|5|great, fit well was new thanks
B00XULVDHK|5|Great
B005KDOAGC|5|great
B00C69EQFS|5|Great<br />Perfect fit<br />Felt the difference right away.  Cleaning the thottle body at the same time will kill two birds and increase full millage as well.
B00CZC83ZA|1|Does not fit the 1156 sockets...
B00BTGSGFK|5|Great to clean car with. Great for inside on leather or small areas.
B00QHA3356|5|This is an excellent replacement for the price, however, after buying this third one I decided to be more technical with my installation. Because the adhesive tape only lasts for only so many car washes, weather changes, etc., the other two fell of after a few months.<br /><br />This time I decided to take the factory mirror apart and lifted the old cracked mirror out with a screw driver (piece by piece). I then laid this one down in its place with the adhesives, put the casing back together, and reinstalled it. Now it looks and works just like factory.<br /><br />As far as the wiring goes, I only lost the heat wiring because it was attached to the old mirror. However the signal and rotation work fine as they were not in the way of anything. No issues... I use an ice scraper in the winter time anyway.
B00CB6QJEC|5|Funny how people can see the same thing and not really see the same thing...  &#34;Miss Spell&#34; is the joke of the pencil to Misspell words....
B00CP6MBTA|5|Both of my rubicons handles went, these handles work well as a replacement. A pain to install however a well built product.
B004AGEWPE|5|I will definitely buy these Brake rotors in the future , as needed . Very well made it doesn't rust much .
B001UE9CJA|5|Nice quality product. Fit perfectly and easy to install.
B00JAHFWM0|4|Was what was described. Arrived quickly.
B002MRFD60|5|Awesome mats fit as good as weather tech an a lot cheaper made from same material an weather tech
B00266Z8JY|1|Duh, shoulda read the reviews 1st. Definitely can't confuse these bulbs with headlights!!! My LED brake lights are brighter!!!
B00G3N1FVQ|4|Works as described but, wire descriptions were backwards had to swap power and tail light wire to make function. Also had to buy a flasher from auto parts store for another $10. Just need an electronic flasher available readily at auto shop. Easy install but be prepared to strip and add some of your own connectors. Plastic &#34;plug and play&#34; doesn't match any connectors I have on 11' ruckus or any auto zone connectors but a simple cut and crimp with other connectors worked just fine.
B0052FRXPS|5|Worked perfectly. Color was as advertised.
B00KLSZ632|5|These are awesome. Bright crystal white while driving and then flip to amber when turning. So cool.
B0071XQ4V8|5|Great item
B001HNKJ4G|5|This paint is a perfect match for Whirlpool SS products with stainless-look plastic parts such as handles and console surrounds that are not made of actual stainless steel. For reference, I used it on the plastic control console surround on a Whirlpool stove, model GS563LXSS and it was a perfect match.
B0037VZKT0|5|Very comfortable, durable and the liner comes out in a minute. I prefer the high viz but this coat comes in a  variety of colors. Joe Rocket products are tough to beat for the money. Sizing was right on when comparing to my other jackets. I'm 5-11 and 190 and a Large was perfect.
B00F4TLDWG|4|They look really nice, but they are a lot smaller than you think they are
B000FW61SI|3|not worth the money
B001FJIQVU|5|It met my expectations
B00NO00JM2|5|Go with the tall it really helps.
B0009IQZFM|5|What a joy to wash the vehicles and have them dried with a shine
B0024NSJWW|5|Fits just like they were supposed to and looks great
B009XU99IW|5|Fit perfect looks great too
B00I6SOZ04|4|Love the sticker, it's perfect now that I cut off the Dodge Ram part since I drive a tundra lol
B00G0P0GHQ|5|Easy install looks great and cant beat the price
B00FBKJ2BW|5|My wife broke the plastic ring out of the OEM remote.  I purchased these and it was just as other reviews said.  They fit well and it was very easy to change out.  Don't hesitate to do this yourself.  I think they are sturdier then the factory ones and I'm very satisfied with these replacement remote housings!
B00TL2V36S|5|Looks great worth is dont pass this offer
B00F8LEB9W|5|Works perfectly! The range is as good if not better than the original. Programming instructions were spot on. Great product.
B00CXTCGBM|4|bolts were smaller than stock.
B008FYXTF6|2|Item damaged
B004A67BT8|5|I've had my 68 Mustang for 18 years with manual steering. This conversion was most instant relief that I've ever purchased. So much easier to handle the car now.
B003Z9WMUO|5|Awesome product with fast shipping. Love it!
B00HMZEZ9S|1|Does not come with 8mm tank plastic bolts, the main bolts that come out
B00FEXCPX8|1|I believe I received a defected one, It did not fit my car at all as the product stated it would. It came quick in the mail, it ALSO had instructions, but sadly also had a warp part in it, I had put in the sun as the instructions said to so it would warp back but that did not do it at all. So after having this product so long it just sits in my garage now collecting dust.
B007OFNE3O|5|Fast shipping.  Decal is exactly as described and looks great on the back window of my pickup.  It took me no more than five minutes to apply.  For those of you complaining about the installation, please read the instructions included with the decal.  This decal is intended to be installed on the outside of your window.  if you want a decal for the inside, look elsewhere.  Installation is very easy:  (1) Clean the area where the decal is to be installed. (2) Carefully peel away the white protective backing - this is NOT the white decal. The decal remains affixed to a clear top layer. (3) Carefully apply the decal to the window all in one piece; I do not recommend trying to re-position the decal once it is applied.  (4) Use a credit card to smooth out the decal and any trapped air bubbles.  (5) Wait a few hours before carefully removing the clear top layer.  More detailed instructions are included with the decal.  EASY!!! and looks great!
B00PD2Q93W|5|A balance of form and function, this premium Mehr key chain combines leather, and what appears to be chrome, creating an attractive-- yet not too fancy-- durable piece. A good value. Note, it's been about a month and so far.
B0097JQ2MA|5|Fits nice. Love it.
B0084874OK|3|Just installed chain for the first time. The package lacked some specifications I could have used.
B00FXLJ8U4|5|seems like a very durable sturdy product and well made with quality materials.  Fast shipping.
B0014YG8AC|5|They work! Used it for 2004 Saturn Vue Base
B00PXFGKVA|5|Just perfect, exactly like the original.
B002XM5G70|3|Wish it had a little more flow but works good and is quiet.
B008FCD1QA|3|Nice chrome finish but it is crooked when it is in there.
B00OZT18AS|4|Fits good and seems to be made well.
B000IOKU12|5|Wonderful. Love it
B00LQHR9GE|5|Very good for the money. Went through a high powered car wash with no water inside. You have a 50/50 chance of getting a good sealed light bar. The light bar puts off plenty of light. No complaints
B006P888VY|5|High quality patch
B005BHX9W8|4|Very nice... I think it has to grow on me before I totally love it. Only two things bother me: the color of the graphic is white and teal blue, not grey. I have a green Jeep and the colors don't go well together. Also, I wish it came with some zip ties or something to help secure it on because I'm worried someone will just slip it off.
B002XL2HVO|3|Plastic white divider tray.  Simple, divides drawer / space as shown.  However, beware that structural integrity might not be as great as you'd like: my tray arrived with a small crack along right side.  To me, it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the effort to return, as the right side still is attached, but it's something to consider.  You can pay a few bucks more for https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00114ZTBO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12 (which I also got in the same order), and that arrived in fine shape.  But, for an add-on, it isn't horrible.
B009P7QZ8A|4|these work really well for everyday to sporty driving and they live up to their name of posi-quiet.  They are good on not dusting much too.
B00F3SZYMS|5|Bosch OEM
9539751047|5|Heavy duty vinyl sticker.  High quality.  Great buy.
B01015EEFK|4|They look good Installation instructions would be nice I haven't been able to install them
B00LML7GJY|5|Very nicely designed product.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what the electric savings are with this. But it is really nice to know I'm charging devices with a small, slender solar product which is simply sitting near a window.<br /><br />Simple to use, with a large button.<br /><br />Built on stand that lies flat, when not in use.<br /><br />Sweet tool!
B0009IQZFM|5|Recommended. I like all Meguiar's products.
B000C2E9YE|5|Can't go wrong with felpro is the only brand i use for all my repairs
B00P6V8PSW|5|OEM replacement, easy to install.
B0007LZXE0|1|Worst hitch ball we have ever used.  Can't get it off without using tools, and even then it is very hard to remove.
B00MQA9ESG|5|Brought this frame to replace the dealer's frame. No free advertisement on my car. This frame looks great on my black Honda. It gives it that extra something. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00G620ZVU|5|👍 just look good  on my truck
B001Y8NEX2|4|Covered several holes and it held up very well! Great product.
B001C9JAKY|5|Works great.....fixed my overheating problem...
B00ST2H3B0|5|Switches operate smoothly and the lights are quite bright. The covers open and close with a positive snap. I am very happy and a great price.
B000GARNEA|4|Appears to be a good product. Haven't had them long enough to determine how the wear vs the outdoor elements
B00KP35ZHA|5|pleased with my selection. prompt delivery
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great Deal

B001AM8CRA|5|Made my truck ride like new. Thanks Rich
B0024NSMBU|5|Great item
B000CQI162|5|First off, let me say that this thing is heavy duty.  The bumper is solid and heavy and looks good on the back of my 2003 TJ Rubicon.  Here are a few things that I would recommend that are not necessarily spelled out in the directions (keep in mind this is for the TJ Wranglers):<br /><br />-  Read the directions thoroughly before you start work.<br />-  Buy good cobalt drill bits to drill through the cross member and frame sections.<br />-  Mark the assorted bolts before you start.  The 8 bolts that mount the bumper to the cross member are different sizes.  4 are 1 1/2&#34; and 4 are 1 3/4&#34;.  They could be easily confused at a glance.<br />-  Drop the gas tank/skid plate about 3-4 inches before you even attempt to hang the bumpers.  You will only need to disconnect the electrical harness on the drivers side and take the torx bits out of the gas cap on the side and the plastic trim around the gas tank filler throat.  This will make accessing the bolt holes exponentially easier for wrenching and torquing.  I would suggest a regular car jack, a 4'x4' post section and a 3/4&#34; plywood scrap that is as wide as the skid plate.<br />-  Tape the 1/4&#34; spacers on the inside of the bumper over the bolt holes.  This will help in the tight space of the cross member.<br />-  If you have a vise, use that to press in the wheel lugs to the tire adapter.  You can cinch them down with a tire iron, but it takes forever.<br />-  This is also easier if you have two people.  Unless you are a meathead, you probably won't be able to hold the bumper and thread the 8 bolts.<br />-  I did not use the brackets for the license plate.  I just took a dremel tool and cut out the OEM license plate holder to fit around the latch for the tire swing.<br />-  For the rubber bump stops that are stock to the TJ tailgate, you only use the driver's side.  More than likely you will have to shim it with something.  My friend and I took one of the other rubber bump stops and cut it with a hot knife (a wood burning iron with an exacto knife attachment) to shim the remaining one.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the bumper and tire swing.  It's a beast and looks great on the Jeep.  Can't wait until payday to get the front Rock Crawler bumper.
B003YNBZI6|5|I received this item within two days of ordering from Redline Moto. It was a &#34;used, very good&#34; item for $26.  It was a great deal and whatever cosmetic flaws there were I didn't even notice and all bolts etc. were included. The hitch itself is solid and well made (as expected) and was a &#34;no drill&#34; installation on our 2008 Ford E-250 extended body conversion/camper van. I was worried I might have to remove the spare, but it fit perfectly and installation was super easy. Very very pleased!
B000WZ9F2W|5|Is coming with 4 bars or 5
B00B5I1EQA|5|Super easy to install with a wet application. I'd recommend this to any camaro owner!
B000V5UKQI|4|Excellent cold air intake replacement for your VW GTI 2006 2.0L engine!  Easy to install, clean, and up-keep.  Waxed-acrylic tubing.  However, the metal casing loses a star rating because it is too open to the engine.  As air is pulled into the engine, and if it is raining, your entire engine gets wet, causing rust at high temperatures.  I fixed this by adding a silicone-filmed nylon tooling fabric (the kind in craft stores for making dresses) to the actual air inlet for the cold air intake system.  This minimally obstructed incoming cold air, and solved the water problem on my car.  This product should come with something like that for the VW specific models.
B000PGVZ30|4|These cord ends are great. The handle is super handy. I made a 100' 30 amp rv extension cord (with the 30 amp cord ends) for my 5th wheel. Now I'm gonna make a 50 amp extension cord with these ends. The only thing I don't like is that the cover on the receptacle box won't close because of the handle on the male plug, closes part way. But, we wintered with it that way and had no problem.
B0002FU44K|5|Excellent brake cleaner - also has high-pressure force behind spray for easy application and cleaning, as indicated.  I was able to use this for my whole car, full rotar and break replacement.
B0046IC24O|5|Fast shipping and right product
B0076MBL0S|5|Solenoid Worked
B007HRGTJA|5|Good price. Good product.
B001CQYLJ2|5|Excellent
B0002JMIEK|5|great polish
B0046R3X7A|1|The Ad on Amszon says &#34;car wash safe&#34;. The &#34;important safety information&#34; that comes with the product says, &#34;Do not use automatic 'brush-style' car washes.&#34; I have yet to see a car wash that doesn't use brushes. I'm sending it back.
B000VHXEJ6|5|This is what a toolbox liner should be like. It's not tacky to the touch and leaves no residue, but it really grips items. The liner stays in place in the drawer and lays flat. The material is reinforced and not stretchy so better measure twice and cut once (with a new, sharp razor knife - this stuff is tough) as the old saying goes. The 24&#34; width allowed me to optimize my cuts with very little waste for my toolboxes. The material measures between 0.040&#34; - 0.045&#34; inches thick, but is surprisingly cushiony. It also reduced the noise of opening and closing my drawers (sound deadening). I use one toolbox for electronic tools and parts. Even round plastic items and cardboard backed packages don't slide around. I am really impressed with the &#34;grip&#34; of this material. This large roll provides way more material than I needed for my toolboxes, but I can see other areas where this can be used around the house and auto. Great product!
B00C3J2XMY|3|Be aware that this a a 200V 50hz unit that comes with a European style plug.  If you're handy you can cobble together a converter cable that you can plug into an American 220V (dryer style outlet).  Running the unit at 60hz instead of 50hz is not an issue.
B009V0JXD0|5|It was a great gift for my Gunner who retired in Feb 15.<br />Semper Fi!<br />DDD
B0089MEDM2|5|Just like the more over priced car covers you can get.  I was very happy so I bought another a couple weeks later.  I waited a month to buy two more for the rest of my cars and was sad to see they went from $121 to $180 so, I passed.  Like they say, all good things don't last for ever but, if you're willing to pay the higher price its a great cover and still not a bad deal, just not the great deal it first was
B001O039US|5|It's an AcDelco &#34;above the line&#34; part for those who are wondering.
B004PXAUGC|1|Stepper motor worked initially but after you shut down does not go back to the home position. Does not work like it is suppose to. Just got ripped off.
B0049MGBZI|5|it works fine
B007HOG8R6|4|This lock provides excellent protection for my bike. The 4' chain is good for one bike but not long enough for two. If you live in an area where theft is a concern this is a great choice.
B000NPS086|5|Easy installation works as expected.
B000EDQQD8|4|Quick delivery with no problems.  Just exactly what we wanted.  If I ever needed this product again I would buy it for sure.
B00HQ3BSNW|5|Product was as it was described and installed easily. No issues and arrived as promised.
B00NUSUXWO|3|This jacket is pretty freakin cool. Lots of compliments on it. I am 5'10&#34; 135 lbs. Skinny and underweight. I'm swimming in the shallow end of the jacket. If you're a skinny guy and you don't plan on getting it tailored.. I wouldn't recommend buy it.
B003UG7SK6|1|Fast delivery. But it is a piece of craps. Threw the bottom part away and using top.
B00092893E|5|My Land Rover Discovery II had an inaccurate dash fuel gauge for a few months where it would only register at 3/4 full on the gauge even though the tank was full of gas. Out of curiosity, I emailed the dealership about the issue since my normal, trusted (non dealership mechanic) was on vacation and the &#34;stealer-ship&#34; stated that I needed a new fuel sender which with parts and labor would have cost over $650. My trusted mechanic (non-dealership) texted me about my issue while he was on vacation and he suggested to add a 20 oz bottle of this to my tank then fill up with premium. He stated this cleans the sulfur deposits on the fuel sender which could alleviate the issue with the inaccurate dash fuel gauge... Well holy heck after adding the 20 oz bottle, filling up then driving for a week, I filled up my tank again and voila... my dash fuel gauge was working again. This $8 bottle saved me almost $650 from the stealership.
B00FER61HK|2|TO SMALL FOR A 31X10.5 SPARE.
B0119XYO3K|5|HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!! SO SIMPLE AND SO VERY COOL RESULTS&#62;...Honestly it's probably safer as well, increases visibility
B00IXR4W60|5|Please be aware that these lights are NOT only daytime running lights, but ALSO include the parking lights AND fog lights.  You can run the fog lights with either the parking lights on or the head lights on.  For some sort of reason the seller does NOT mention that these also include FOG lights!<br /><br />These lights do not interfere with the function of the rear fog lights, if included on your MINI.<br /><br />I've had these lights for 9 months and had the local MINI dealer install them.  I've had no problem with them.<br /><br />Make sure after installing to let your car insurance company know for your DRL discount.
B0009IK5XA|4|Works as expected
B006L78P76|5|I should have read more carefully. Had I known it was just a sticker placed on the frame I wouldn't have ordered it. But it came quickly and was inexpensive so no complaints.
B001O0ZX5C|2|I have not yet installed these, I will say however that there are no notes on this product whatsoever that tells that this is for 1 WHEEL ONLY...This sucks...
B0009IQZFM|5|Need more than one for drying a car .
B0025UGOVW|5|worked well nice little grease gun
B008FOGE3U|5|Works just great and a good price.  Attach carefully -- it will be there to stay.
B009ESAZHW|5|I beat these up so bad riding through the woods on my utv and nothing stops them. Extremely bright and durable would absolutely purchase again
B00N2HENWE|1|Ordered this product and received one that was different from picture. The mounting plate was different. Luckily the bolt spacing on the coils themselves are the same so I just switched them to the mounting plate I needed. Works fine just a little extra work that wasn't necessary.
B009DJMLGA|5|Just installed this morning, works great.  Must say the orig motor assy had nuts to hold in place, this unit had threaded holes.  No big deal, a trip to the hardware store for M6X16 bolt.  Just be aware of this.<br /><br />Good price and it seems like a quality replacement part.  If you keep a car long enough you'll be changing all these out.
B00WOT3YM6|1|The design was fairly nice, easy to read.  It worked fine on the first tire.  It was took a little coaxing of turning it on and off to get it to work on the second tire.  It hasn't worked since....
B000AMW0J2|5|Real deal
B001LL9UQ2|5|PERFECT
B00QMTAZ1W|5|Great little fuse box
B007SZ8RK0|5|awesome BOV will recommend to anyone with a WRX/STI
B000630IBC|5|Great item
B005J1UK2I|5|Install was a little difficult but well worth the effort. These make the original equipment stabilizers look like erector set toys.
B000F74DM4|5|I really love this items and they all arrived undamaged.
B001JT76C6|5|What can I say, it's wire as described.
B00F0DNJ0U|2|color is fading
B000ENOBVW|5|I now own two of these.  I used it on my 2005 Ford Freestar Van when I used it as a camper.  Then I bought a small Teardrop Trekker Travel Trailer.  It has a back hatch on it as well in which the kitchen is located.  To my delight I am able to use my Cabana on it as well!!  It gives me weather protection and shade when I &#34;in the kitchen.&#34;
B00IMVK08G|5|Does what it's made for , blocks the sun and lightens the snowy and foggy nights. Very effective by the way
B000E28CSG|5|Works and fits for Suzuki ltz 400
B00QQYXI1C|5|Solid door locks,,, I had to use the old screws that were longer to mount the back plate to the front plate,,,other than that no issues...<br />And the 2 locks are keyed the same....AWESOME!!!!
B00P5YPH18|5|Good replacements. A little loose fit. Wrapped the circumstance with tape and they fit snugly
B000C5CEKC|5|Fit my Toyota FJ Cruiser and has no faults.  It's been a month now and hasn't bothered at all,  at first I was scared the engine check light would turn on because of leakage but resulted to have a perfect fit and perfect seal! Great product.
B00FBPQK7Q|5|Good quality. Works great so far.
B00C0NXK2K|5|Perfect fit! Keeps my car cool in the sun.
B007BKFFZM|4|Worked good.
B00BYAMOFO|5|Bolted right up, like it was made for it! Haha. Nice to have peace of mind that there is support at transfer case now. After I went through the whole &#34;cracked extension housing&#34; ordeal.
B009AFFYR0|5|Very sturdy crossbars. I was able to easily install them on my 2012 GMC Acadia with no issues. Each locked firmly and securely into place with just a few turns of the hex wrench which comes with the package. Crossbars held over an 80 lb container filled with camping gear during our family's annual camping trip to the Northern California redwood forest.  Definitely worth the price paid.
B003HB5WPW|5|I love my plastic rims :)
B003GD4FP4|5|Great quality sticker and show of support!
B00X69U9B2|5|Nice knurled edge, easy to grip, but not as secure as the OEM bolt.<br /><br />Otherwise it is excellent.
B010FZMJY4|5|Look and feel very good. Don't know what will happened with time. But I think it's good for the price.
B00MIZTAK6|5|I brought this for my sister as a gift for her first car and she loved it! It is so cute and the color is very nice. Although the material is plastic, the ears are very sharp.  The keychain goes well with her keys and now she has safety,
B00TTM3ET4|5|This exhaust sounds AWESOME!!! Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for our 2015 Mustang GT Convertible. Would highly recommend this exhaust to anyone looking for that additional &#34;growl&#34;!!!
B004RBWV5K|3|Makes a weird noise when starting engine, it's not the small either not shore why the put mini
B0012TZ1WK|5|excellent oil for the small motors
B00T45RGM2|5|I have been looking for an affordable and functional ignition switch key set for my 50 cc scooter for some time until I stumbled upon this product and I have to say that it has fully satisfied all of my needs. It came perfectly packaged and in short time. Even though I am not so good with machines and tools I was able to easily install this key set as it fit perfectly my scooter. It has been pretty reliable ever since as I had no problems with it and I have been using it for some time now. Overall, I am very happy that GOOFIT manufactured this key set and made it so easily available. I really recommend buying this product as it will save you a lot of time and money. Not to mention that easy installation boosted my confidence for fixing stuff so I have been looking into making similar improvements on some of my other vehicles.
B003CH577Y|5|Fit perfectly on my Porter Cable Da polisher and works awesome with hook and loop pads
B00H9S71LW|2|It connected the first time with the vehicle then never connected again.  After doing research it seems to be a common Android problem.  There is no manual to be found other than the startup guide that comes in the package.  I tried the work around I found on the forums:<br />1. Unplug the OBDLink LX,<br />2. Un-pair with the LX on the phone,<br />3. Plug the OBDLink LX back into the vehicle,<br />4. Re-pair with it.<br />5. Reset it to factory defaults by holding down the button until the power light flashes rapidly, which should take about 20 sec.<br />6.Then finally manually un-pair on the phone and re-pair once this is done.<br />But it's not working for me.  I have to return it.
B0088A4IUM|4|Rad system, but works better with a helmet with removable tabs in the front mouth section, which my helmet does not. And I did not feel like drilling my helmet out, for the tube to fit through. It would also be better if the mouth piece did not ride up on the face, thus creating a irritating sensation while riding. But overall a neat handsfree option for your hydro pack.
B00IIE87G4|5|Comfortable for extended wear. Retractable sun shade a plus. Quick delivery. Would buy this product from this vendor again.
B00A14JXFS|5|Easy installation, look great on my truck. From opening the box to having them installed on my truck about 30 minutes.
B003TODXQW|4|I used this to insert a bunch of nutzerts into a Jeep.  For my limited use it worked great!  It's obviously a cheaper tool and not meant to be used a lot and probably not great with the larger nutzerts but for smaller or midsized and light use applications you can't really complain about this tool.  It has held up well for me and set the nuts perfectly.
B00BGSFJUG|5|This fluid is totally needed for my 1948 Pontiac and 1969 Chevy convertible.
B0048IZX6Q|5|great parts
B00OPMIR2M|1|Bough this tire pressure gauge 5 months ago because of all the positive reviews. It worked fine when I received it however it no longer gives a reading. It lights up but shows a digital 0.0 for all the various pressure readings. I took it apart and tested the batteries and they were all OK.
B00C5SO4GQ|5|Exact replacement part.
B000E4NRKC|5|Overall everything is good.
B0094JZSR8|2|Worked great for awhile then broke pretty easily. Very accurate, but isn't durable at all. I would not recommend buying this junk, you will be buying another very soon.
B00H2TD5IQ|4|Excellent service and quality of parts. Thanks
B009AA9WVY|5|Watch how to rep.ace on youtube
B0006N5RYK|4|works as advertised.
B005ZFBB6W|5|Shockingly perfect.  Probably saved me easily over $100.  So easy to replace my mirror I can't believe auto shops charge so much more.  You'd never know now that my mirror was ever damaged.
B000MTLXZA|1|I bought this key chain in December 2013 as a Christmas gift for my son at the price of $6.71 and the hinge broke a couple months ago. I see there has been quite a price increase! He likes it a lot but it didn't last very long.
B00SVEQPRE|5|Item was shipped fast, packaged good. Thanks for the extra small one attached. I love it.
B000C98V82|5|Worked perfectly and came with the screws. Surprisingly, some don't and adds either cost or additional work. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone needing a replacement.
B00GOR6098|5|I don't understand why others have had any problems with this unit.  This is the second window regulator in my 2007 Jeep Liberty that I have replaced with a Dorman unit, the other being a rear side window.  They fit perfectly in both cases.  I did have to cut the hard rubber stops at the bottom a little to match the OEM unit.  In a direct comparison with the driver's side window, still OEM, the Dorman unit both raised and lowered the window faster.  Plus I can't see why anyone would spend more money to buy an OEM replacement when it is obviously of poor design, since it shouldn't have failed in the first place.  The Dorman design is clearly superior and is a lot easier to install in the door than the original.
B007PKJUKO|5|Good
B002JBOYA0|4|Using this paint on my Wheel Horse tractor, Not sure how it will hold up.
B0006PJJC4|5|Works great and no spillage
B0092ZWDNG|4|Made well and fits good. Came on time.
B000C5GAUM|5|Fixed my check engine light for evap line leakage on my 2003 altima
B00N2BX1QO|1|Item does not fit my Xterra as described. It arrived with a single page of Spanish instructions. I was informed that they do not have any English instructions. They referred me to a YouTube video for installation on a sedan, which is useless with an SUV. Item was also incorrectly assembled (we had to rethread straps, etc.). Do not buy this, it may not fit your vehicle and you will get no support from the seller!
B00062ZH3C|1|Purchased this product to do my rear window in the truck. Wasted two entire rolls. This product is very hard to use. Placing on window without it becoming a complete disaster or looking terrible is very difficult. I would rather windows that are not tinted over windows that are but look terrible
B004LF14Q4|5|Perfect replacement piece !  We have a jayco tent trailer and the unit kept squealing and this fixed the issue !!!
B0022ZAFOC|5|what a surprise!
B00KPCHK5Q|5|Great sturdy nice looking rack, simple and functional, just what you'd expect. Installation is pretty easy although there were no instructions enclosed and I couldn't find a video on it either.<br />One tip- have a small wooden dowel (I used a cheap chopstick like the kind they give you when you order Chinese take-out) to align the brackets with the lower seat bolts. It can be kind of hard to get the brackets and the threaded hole lined up and you don't want to cross-thread or strip your seat bolts!
B00BD6WQC0|5|Very clean
B00D6MBGL6|5|Added these to the Can Am side by side. Great accent light. I cleaned the surface with alcohol applied the lights and the next day they started to fall off. I took them off and used 3m automotive 2 way trim adhesive reinstalled them and now they will never move. It's worth adding new adhesive because they look great.
B003Y3ZI5W|5|Make your job a lot easier. I'll never dismount a 22.5 or 24.5 without it.
B000VVYS6K|1|This dose NOT fit my 1999 dodge Dakota with the v8 318 motor. Even tho clearly Amazon says it dose. So a big waste of money says on the box it comes in fits small block dodge motors from year 1965-1991
B00DS7185S|5|Actually made by Hyundai. Satisfied.
B008K8SFA6|5|Work great!
B00979N8H2|5|Got these for my buddies gf, she loves them and they were a perfect fit as well... even arrived two days early. # Happy with my perches.
B006N91BLY|5|Rockin deal on a group 49 AGM...!
B009SN5OO2|5|Replacement front brake rotors for 2010 Mazdaspeed3 work just like the factory units and I haven't had nay trouble since installation a year ago. Would recommend to others.
B000H7DXBO|4|This worked perfectly for my motorcycle. Easy to set up and charge.
B000GU1RD8|5|Perfect replacement.  Save your money from &#34;official HD or OEM&#34; at triple the price.  These are durable, well plated, easy to install and bright.
B005N6XDM8|4|Good buy.......
B000C8ZC8K|5|I’m swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and needed to replace the exhaust from the engine to the muffler… the rest was replaced not too long ago. The Walker 15034 converter I was installing was shorter than the one that was being replaced so I try adding a Dynomax 41976 connector pipe to make up the difference… but I didn’t factor in enough for what slipped into the pipes and I was a few inches short so I cut a piece from another 41976 to make up the shortage. That ended up being a little sloppy, had some leakage and then I did it right by using this pipe and cutting it to the exact length needed. I’m in a very rural area so most repairs get done in my driveway and it costs a lot less than going to a shop 40-miles away so as a do-it-yourselfer I have never had a complaint with any Walker/Dynomax item I’ve used and I have replaced everything on my 1990 Chevy K2500 truck from the engine all the way to the back. I use the Walker site to make sure I get the correct part number because this site often shows the correct item as not fitting my vehicle but the prices here have ranged from good to excellent and a connector pipe I just purchased was about one-third the cost from the auto parts store.
B00HE8HBPS|1|does not fit a Nissan Altima 08 2.5s with stock 16&#34; wheels
B000E9Z49Y|5|Better than windex, smells great, wipes clean!  A+
B009DJXEQQ|5|It definitely hinges my hood.. 2008 Mazda 3
B000UCKMYM|5|These are the second pair we've purchased.  For the money, these are awesome.
B003XWEO8Q|5|I like they fit in my hand . They are comfortable.
B00ULNXCCO|4|This is not a stock grille badge by any means.  It is metal.  It does not feel cheap.  It has a nice weight to it.  It does not fit in the stock holes of my 2013 dodge dart.  You have to fit it through the holes of the grille.  It will not fall off if done correctly.  I like it.  I think it looks pretty nice.  But if you take your $5 and go on dartsofamerica on Facebook,  they will hook you up with a stock badge.
B000EQ0O7O|5|These pads are a perfect fit for my 2006 4Runner SR5. Very easy install thanks to Toyota engineers. Near silent and completely dust free.
B00FEZMI4M|5|I love it just right size, My car looks better with this with well protected bumper
B008G22REQ|4|Product is really good Quality is a little less then OEM but well worth the price
B00LLZFI6E|5|I haven't had to use it and I hope I don't have to.. The fact that I have it and I know how useful it is makes me feel so safe.
B0028ZKMM6|5|Works great for install an air horn in any car!
B00Q8G57Q2|5|works great used on a carport for outside lighting with a 12volt solar battery system
B00BFJD4C6|5|I got this and filter 75-3058 s and b for my 2005 duramax lly. This worked very well definitely add some acceleration from a stand still. I would definitely recommend if you have a lly duramax. Don't know about any mileage boost but helped throttle response. Easy install give yourself an hour and a half and you'll have plenty of time. That's with the intake
B00D6T266S|5|These fit my 2005 Honda van perfectly and fixed my problem.
B00902FQN0|4|The grease fitting in the end that is inside the rim path is to tall and rubs on the rim. I pumped the fitting full of grease to be sure &#34;knuckle&#34; was full then removed fitting and installed threaded plug with low profile. otherwise this fit perfect and was quite a bit less expensive than stock.
B00D2C1ZO8|5|As expected thank you
B00L6NTGMS|5|Great price, received quick, plug and play can't ask for anything else
B003Z49L2G|4|Nice THANKS
B00L40E1VO|1|I received the item today and it came broken. I do not like the item and will not order it again.
B00SNR8DW4|5|Pro abortion Catholic's should also research when there is a heart beat & brain waves in a unborn baby.  Of course which is more important ones faithful walk or the right of some innocent that needs our protection --- first research words one uses and then learn some human biology.
B006T08WXM|5|High quality
B007ZDGUEA|5|good stuff fit perfect  tks
B001DCIRA4|5|Worked perfectly on my wife's 2002 CRV EX. WARNING it does not come with the screw that holds the switch in the door jamb. Luckily, the hardware on my old switch was in good shape so I was able to reuse it.
B00KQUWUZW|5|Good price
B005WR6AOQ|3|Comes with no bolts/screws, not convenient at all.
B00C5T6OS6|5|Fast delivery excellent product great price
B00XN646I0|3|Good product!  Poor installation directions. Left and right side parts were pictured and labeled incorrectly causing misalignment of running board to bracket holes. I had to remove and flip flop brackets from drivers to pass. Side to make  them !work
B009PMJP6E|1|1 light didn't work
B0001EW4B8|5|Easily installed on my 2003 Camry. Tape seams are still tight 1 year later with no signs of pulling free. Had trouble with my 1st set of the same vent shades on my Camry... Tape seams pulled free from both ends on all 4 shades. Not this time... Recommend.
B00DJDI09I|5|This cushion is working perfectly.
B00JBIAJ12|5|Love em! !
B002WZJOP8|5|Ford logo .... is nice
B000AMOEGY|4|I haven't had to use these yet but I carry them in my vehicle just in case, they seem to be well made.
B00KTJ7IGQ|4|Worked but had to have a locksmith program it. No youtube methods worked.
B0101AUG6Q|5|Good sticker. Not too big.
B000KZ2DU0|1|it did not work and no one would program it.
B008EWPHZE|1|Head lights are good and bright, but the only problem is the main brackets that hold the lens onto the vehicle have already broke on both sides (driver side and passenger side). So what good is a good bright head light if it won't stay on the vehicle. Cheap plastic brackets.
B000C5YD42|3|Works fine
B00N4ET4KG|5|Love the so amazing
B00KMYYQ36|5|Use it on my convertible top - the trick is NOT to spray it on, but pour some in a small dish and use a clean (preferably new) paint brush and brush it onto the top; you want it IN the cloth top, not ON the cloth top. Beads water up to a year (but I'm in Las Vegas so there isn't much rain)
B000BROATY|5|For all of you Dodge Ram 1500 owners with the factory towing package and the relay issue. This fixes the problem for a fraction of doing the relay fix from Dodge
B006DAD2BK|4|I put this on my 2011 Dodge Charger R/T Mopar Edition, and I am very glad I went with Borla. It's not super loud at cruising speeds, but you definitely know it's there, when you open it up and it's hurts people's ears. Gave my car a more aggressive sound, deeper tone, and added performance. I can notice a difference in acceleration, and mpg. It's not the loudest exhaust for my car but it's the best performance exhaust, and you can't beat the million mile waranty. To me this exhaust is worth every penny. It fits perfect, sounds great and is a great investment.
B0091XPJ4O|1|Did not work well
B004EDF8HY|1|Runs very hot
B006K8IMKQ|1|This is a Single bolt pattern NOT dual pattern like the picture shows. Lazy, Yes they can change the image if they wanted to. Guess its easier to mislead the customer.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Works for my 2008 Mazda 3
B0093E8SRG|5|Easy to install after reading some reviews. Make sure it goes in the correct way and slowly click it in.
B0006IX87S|5|This does everything short of bless my water
B005BNP7YU|4|The chrome finish wears off after a few months, this is my second one I've purchased due to a rear-end collision (kid backed into my truck)...<br />So I suggest buying a can of clear spray paint, apply two light coats of the paint before installing on vehicle.<br />Six month have gone by and no fading of the chrome.  (this works on other plastic that has been chromed)
B00R5Y2F0W|5|[[VIDEOID:6664a5a7267608320df1355645dc6f74]] This organizer is perfect for road trips, but even for short trips if you have kids.  You can store anything from small drink bottles to larger sized drinks and snacks.  The mesh pocket lets you see everything easily and if something spills or leaks, the organizer is waterproof so you don't have to worry about much.<br /><br />In my video review, I show exactly how this organizer looks and works.  For more details, see the video.  If this review was helpful, please click on 'yes' below.  Happy shopping!
B00OBZ9H4A|5|Fast shipping, great product.
B001806YE2|5|Best money I ever spent highly rated on Titan Talk so tried it out and night and day difference exhaust is no longer raspy and sounds better. Best of all absolutely no more drone in cab but exhaust still sounds great!
B00PJMOMCQ|5|I read many reviews that this was a nice replacement band for the leather bands that came with the Moto 360. And it was. Middle weight, but comfortable and the style reminds me of the bands on my TAG and ORIS watches Replacing the band was straight forward using the tool that came with the band. I did struggle for a just moment with removing the link pins to resize the band, until I realized that they are NOT actual screws or screw-type pins and that they could be removed with my simply watch pin remover tool. If you're like me with dozen of watches, this little tool is invaluable. Would recommend.
B007DCCYJS|5|AWESOME! Thanks!
B009FUFBTG|2|Don't expect these to be very big, they are the size of a wash cloth and very thin material.
B0012UK3M2|1|I'd give no stars if it was an option. Two new bulbs lasted 3 months!  Terrible quality, but had to put another pair in because I couldn't drive around with no headlights .  I'll order a backup pair of another brand.
B00NFSNAS8|4|Used the air pump for the first time yesterday and found it easy to attach and it delivered air satisfactorily and efficiently.  Having to plug it into the dash port made it a bit of a stretch reaching the real wheel of my truck, but it did reach it just barely.  One drawback was the placement of the plastic cover for the gauge.  It did not fit easily and popped out when I tried to store the unit.  Reinstalled it but the fit is difficult and awkward, maybe I did it wrong.  Delivery of this item exceeded my expectations as I had it in less than a week and it was well packaged and protected.  The unit comes attractively packaged in a carrying case which is handy and makes it easy to carry and store and is quite attractive.
B00XP5O2HE|4|Nice product.  Nog the most durablem but i knew that with the price.  Great little tail box though.  No installation instructions.  I needed to get creative with install, but nothing any one with sonething betwern their ears couldn't do.  Just  do it.
B00BUV2VEG|1|Crummy products! !!! Too much hassle with returning items#
B007QV1UYQ|4|It twists HORRIBLY when under pressure.  There is NO way to roll it up under pressure.  However, it does remain flexible as promised.  Update:  After a few months under pressure it now acts just like it should under pressure.
B00ERXG4TM|4|The tension screw makes this unit a major improvement over the original, i have this unit on both of my two motorcycles and eases my hour long commute to work and regular 4 hour ride to visit friends and family.
B00252CYP0|5|Thank you!
B004VNM8AM|5|really nice graphics, put it on the back of my helmet
B00OPVYHZ4|5|great piece , love it ,great price
B00EDZD5EQ|4|working as advertized
B00GSAUHB8|5|great product. easy to use.  don't let the thin material fool you. this product really works well and keeps the steering wheel & dashboard cool. I use a clothespin to hold it together just above my rear view mirror on my cr-v. then just fold down the 2 visors to hold it in place. just bought another one for my civic.
B00KIKYREW|1|It didn't work for Me . Thank interior is to shallow for  newer Dodge Oil pressure sending unit .
B004QDN518|5|LOUD!  The way I like it!  My tiny Fiat 500e needs to be heard because the behemoth SUVs can't see me!
B003YNHR3S|5|Everything worked great together!
B002NS9792|5|great product!!! Great customer service
B0002STS3U|5|Perfect!
B000YQJHYK|5|Used on 2005 GMC Yukon XL denali.  Nice illumination.  I would recommend changing program to keep these bulbs illuminated when switching to High beams.  These need to warm up again, depending on the duration of high beam use.
B004M2RMFS|4|I have had these grips on other bikes. This time the left grip was a bit loose. Several co-riders also bought these and had the same problem. Had to wrap tape around the bar, then install the left. Right one fit perfect. Nice thick grips that make your hand more comfortable for long rides. If you plan to use these for off road or dual sport, I'd advise against it. These are great for cruiser, touring, and commuting. There are also weights that fit the end of the grips if you need to replace handle bar grips with weights on the end.
B000EDOT82|5|Very good quality
B009UOPSOK|5|perfect.  thanks!
B00S8X66NG|4|Good Little throttle grip.  Great value but MEASURE your overall throttle cable length--this could have been a tad longer but it worked out for me but just barely.
B001PWFPE8|2|They say one works. However minimally suggest 2
B00O616M6K|5|Great product
B006X98A7C|4|Works fine.... If this battery is a little too big for your device you can bend / break the tabs off (in your device) to make it fit
B000A2N7K8|5|Sticks to the window nicely and is attractive.  Fairly accurate.
B007I6K3YW|5|Perfect fit! My Cub Cadet starts better than when it was new.
B00498LHWE|5|Perfect fit for the Whipple Supercharged LS3 in my Camaro SS.  Only 10 rib belt that I could find for my application, turns out to be one of the best belts you can buy!
B00COYNZJ8|4|Good condition, but the picture is a touch too dark. It fits good in my car. I am a real Fan of starwars and would recomanded it. Good peace of work. :)
B00MQA8Z2C|5|Very Nice, classy replacement for cheesy dealer frame. Why do dealers do that to such a nice car!!
B00JDPRJZW|1|Missing the cable part of the charger!

B001GORX3Q|1|Picture is deceptive. The product was correct however it's not just the bulb. It comes with connected wires that wouldn't plug and play with my headlights. Thought i was getting just bulbs.
B006LVXRPM|5|Replaced OEM, very happy for the price!
B00JBIAU7U|5|First time replacing headlights. First one little aggregating, 2nd lot easier once tricks figured out.
B000CFO0GI|1|blew out after two uses
B002XM4ZTK|4|Looks great and reduces the amount of dirt and debris inside the trailer.  You can leave them on during travel.
B00NSS4UMU|3|This light bulb is ok. Its the same type required for my fog lights and low beams. I originally purchased them to use as low beams. However, after installing them and driving at night with them I noticed they were not bright enough to use as low beams. I took them out and used them for my fog lights. They look much better as fog lights. I had to reinstall the factory low beams . They were actually brighter than these bulbs. If your looking for fogs these are perfect.
B00HNGBOL8|5|Took care of my problem instantly.  I like the steady metal design and the lube feature.
B000FGIBYQ|5|It was just what I have been looking for! It works great! !
B000B8JUAW|1|Good
B002P8CIIW|5|very fine
B00W8AYXPS|5|works great !
B00QCO9O5K|5|Awesome fast deliver, good product overall!
B002E5YFGO|4|good
B000BUR9O4|1|Really don't think it did anything but make my exhaust go bad, could have been coincidental.
B00PRC8JBS|5|Get the instructions online if you need them.<br />100% recommend, will work on 2013+ cummins soon.
B00LIP32Y2|3|Have not seen any measurable increase in mpg after 3000 miles of use. But, my 2010 4.6L V8 Genesis does seem to have more power and is more responsive. Hopefully it repairs and protects the metal as they advertise on their website.
B00OOAJY5E|5|Very cute.
B001KPJDMU|1|this will not fit a 2001 Ford Explorer.
B004GEA3U8|4|what can i say but it was nice.
B00YGBNIPI|5|This worked great for me. I transferred all of the internal components to the new case, including the old key and the original back.<br />Much cheaper than paying the dealer for a new fob, and for the programming cost.
B00LH9UNF0|5|Great product. The bearing is a nice touch!
B00EYWF6MW|5|Plastic attachments are lose. I had to use crazy glue to hold it together. Suction device works perfectly. Video is good.
B009DJVVBQ|5|Works like it should. I can update after 50k miles.
B00029KAPO|1|It will take you forever to put It on. Do Not Buy!
B004A2BGAW|5|Energizing so far.<br />More exited over not breaking old plugs off in head this time!
B005ASY23I|4|I purchased this for emergencies so I haven't used it yet. I did plug it in and ran it and seems to be of good quality.
B004SX5HNA|2|This item is ok. The ad is miss leading from the actual product. Was kinda disappointed when the product came in cause it wasn't at all what I thought it was.. :(
B00PT031CA|5|Perfect
B00F8RL4Z0|4|Great except the letters are just stuck on so I don't know how long it will last
B00K5VNF2E|5|I bought these and came in faster then i expected , i installed myself all 6 with die electric grease and anti-lock seize paste as recommended already drove over 100 miles and no problems  and i have noticed the slight misfire i had on highway speeds is gone so i'm pleased to say the least.<br />I originally only had one bad coil but at the price and the work involved i figured i do all 6 with all 6 plugs and lower gasket  ... all I can say is that my 2009 Buick Enclave is happier now!  :)
B004R2ZQUG|5|Works great on my 17 foot aluminum bassboat.
B009DJVATY|5|fit perfect, works great.
B007C5TO5I|5|Just what I needed to touch up the paint
B008PXBAXK|5|love it
B001O0YBI2|5|quality rods, not much else to say!
B002GUYW7O|5|Love it!  I installed it yesterday, and I would say the total job took about 25 minutes, and I took my time. There are two must-haves for the job: 1. a 10mm socket wrench (all screws etc. are 10mm) and 2. a good YouTube tutorial on a nearby laptop, phone, or tablet to go by as you do the job. I used this one &#62;&#62; https://www.youtube[DOT]com/watch?v=jIByARCn5kg &#60;&#60; It goes nice and quickly, and you just play and pause as you go along. Like others on here, I didn't like the idea of paying $300 or so for something I thought I could do myself, and, so far, it has worked out great!
B000IYI9WY|5|Easily installed! Worked perfect. Perfect fit for my Audi MK1!
B0029ITVT2|5|They were awesome
B008B9W0IC|4|I like this product<br />Nice looking , very sticky , no bubbles , easy to apply &#62;&#62;&#62; I put it on my BMW E34 sunroof ..
B000Z0HVHA|5|Not needed cord on fridge box very long. But will be useful for other things.
B00WYRKZA2|4|Helmet seemed nice. I ordered the size that my current helmet is which is close. Class was definitely too small but this is a discontinued item for them and they didn't have xxl. Their return polo y was simple to use.
B0012WW4D6|4|Fit on my 2006 chevy cobalt ss sc
B00BITL6S2|5|The filter fits perfectly. I am very pleased with the purchase.
B00TLNNNPQ|3|I ordered it but it came in the wrong color
B00252928M|5|Great filter
B009SSV26Q|2|I like how the emblem looks like on the back of the car but for the front part it doesnt fit.
B00AQ4VOS2|5|Just what I needed
B0080ATEFO|5|Looks great.  Arrived on time.
B00CP2UB9Q|1|Did not fit. They were loose and would not snug up like the OEM bar ends. This was my experience with the bar ends I received. Requesting a refund.
B00D2OHWVG|5|Simply exceeded my expectations at every turn - quick shipping and everything arrived in perfect condition as advertised.  Lined the ceilings in my daughter's rooms with these when we remodeled and they are amazed at all the different color schemes and blinking pattern there are.  I would by with confidence - they have been on nonstop for about a week now and absolutely no complaints.
B00NEZ97NY|5|Got this as a gift for my husband.  He loves zombies and the Beatles.  Win -win. Applied easily to his car window. No issue with bubbling or wrinkling. Clean lines. It has held up fine all summer long through high heat,  rain, and weekly car washes. If it changes, I'll update my review. Otherwise,  I'm pretty happy with this purchase. Recommend.
B000WJ0RK2|5|Daughter's first car!  Has pink windshield wipers, so Hello Kitty floor mats a definite addition!!  Great quality #dottiedixon
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Phil the Car Trash bag is exactly what I was looking for! I just bought a new care and really did not want the &#34;backseat of trash&#34; any more and Phil is the perfect solution. Great quality and construction and love that there is room for tissues and also a water bottle! The company offers great customer service! I will be shopping there more often!
B00FH8P1DG|5|Amazing is all I can say for this bad boy! If i had another vehicle I'd definitely buy another
B001B78TTA|5|Replaced my old Core one month ago and everything is working well. Installed in a 2005 T&C with dual air. Hardest part of the replacement was taking everything apart. One tip, the part that usually fails (creates the leak) is not the evaporator core but the extension tube which is actually the part that is exposed behind the wheel well.
B00MJ484RQ|5|easy to put on, shipped faster than expected
B00RW7EVKO|5|Great quality, perfect fit.
B004P0FQPU|5|Was a gift for another person.
B00FQTG0JK|4|It works and fits perfectly in my Toyota Corolla Le 2015, however it sags a bit after use but definitely my car isn't as hot as it used to be (about 15-20 degrees less than outside temp). Wish it could have been more stiff in structure to keep it from sagging.
B003TQ07P0|5|Just what I needed.
B003V9XYNW|5|I have some large areas to mow that are pretty much an acre of weeds that once was a dumping ground for the former owner and no matter how much I clean it up I still run over stuff on with my lawn tractor and tires go flat. I put tubes in the front but the rear tires are still tubeless so I purchased both the 10056 & 10008 to see if it would help. My neighbor has having a similar problem and swore by this stuff. All four tires now have now been Slimed and no flats in the past few months and I’m pretty sure I’m still running over stuff and this product is sealing it off as it occurs. My neighbor has also no had a flat. I did use a similar Slime product on a truck tire that was always losing air to the point it needed to be pumped up about every week and after filling it with Slime it never leaked again. This stuff has worked for me and it’s definitely a lot easier than trying to plug the tires (I have used the Slime plug kit on my truck tire and it has held up well) or pulling those front wheels off the tractor to patch a tube. I pumped some of this into my wheelbarrows and so far they’re retaining air much better than before I did so. For the price and ease of use this will always be my first choice. However, you do need to remove the valve stem before you put this stuff into the tire/tube.
B00B7CM4DQ|5|Fantasic colors and good quality vinyl.  These went on my orange Kawasaki Ninja and they contrast extremely well!<br />I expected only the 4 &#34; set but the kind seller included a smaller set at 2&#34; as well..
B00I6VTUWY|5|Got here on time, looks wonderful. Send it to my son to keep in his car.
B006N931O4|5|Great quality and easy to install
B001PWFPE8|5|Works great on my Silverado.
B0083H5V92|5|Fit great. But unfortunately, The person who the vehicle was being sold to blacked out (due to alcohol)  at the wheel and crashed and died a few weeks later. So as far as longevity goes. We will never know...
B009IF2HMW|1|Not happy  says 7 pin harness is included but i didnt get one... only received the resistor
B00IUVEPC0|5|They fit great and block out the wind & dirt. When I'm measured for glasses at the eye doctor, I get youth frames. So these smaller sunglasses fit my face well.
B004C3MTXM|5|Went on easily and looks great!
B0018LSCJQ|5|If you are going to attempt to install this kit, you need to be prepared.  I've read the complaints about this kit and my experience is that the complaints are based on the fact that installing this kit is not easy.  The kit is fantastic.  It is simply not easy to replace all the bushings on any vehicle.  You need to either be very experienced or you need to be patient to install this kit.  But, the quality is high, the product is exactly as they present it, and the instructions are easy to understand.  After installing 80% of the kit, my Jeep feels super tight and all the clanking of metal on metal due to the worn out natural rubber factory bushings is gone.  It's like a new vehicle.
B00DAFMO0G|5|I bought this for my mother in law. She took it to an auto dealership to be installed.<br /><br />They were very surprised at how well rapped it was. How well the paint job is.<br /><br />It went on perfect. Saved a lot of money.<br /><br />They installed it for $75.<br /><br />I am very pleased.
B005I60VZK|1|did not work
B00TTG70WC|5|The best available solution for the Mercedes passenger side mirror! Mercedes charges $100 more! Not counting installation.!!!<br />Good fit. Good quality glass and easy replacing.
B004LF6QQW|5|Works great
B001NI7KE2|5|This is very handy to make extra space or hang a pole where you need extra clothes storage.  We purchased two of these and one went in our sons closet, we used twine to hang it lower to provide two levels for his hanging clothes and double hanging space in his closet.  The other went in our room, which is in the basement and has no closet.  For both we were able to adjust to the exact length we needed.
B000FPYHOU|5|I am a school bus driver and I have placed my clock on the dash.  It is very accurate which is very important for my job.  Love it!
B0027QWNGO|4|Larger than expected
B007H2RJ80|2|Good..but Streaks
B007V2B3L0|5|Once I committed to the price of the item it was all good.This item is based on 6+2 panels of 1/4 inch insulating board custom fitted for the vehicle.It is light but substantial.Easy to store and deploy given the fact that it folds only horizontally.It makes a substantial difference in car temperature in the hot sun.It is empowering.I am very happy.
B007KACYYS|5|fits exactly as expected. check youtube videos reviewing this jacket for more specific info on sizing.
B000CCZ59C|4|Ordered a set to replace oems after 85k. 1 of the Monroe's  was binding out of the box. Amazon replacement policy was quick. I would recommend testing the shock before bolting on. Cut off the restraint straps and compress with ur body weight to check for binding/squeaking.
B00BFSWZF4|1|Hose is very short and this makes it difficult to add R134a with the can in the upright position.  After 3 cans of R134a, the hose started leaking.  Total waste of money and I would not buy another one.
B00WXBYYR4|1|2 cans were not pressurized
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Quick and convenient. Easy to use and fold-up when finished.
B00KFPDLZQ|3|Not as bright as I hoped, but you get what you pay for, they are built better than other inexpensive led wedge bulbs but there is only one led element. The color produced by these is great, just want more of it.
B000CONU1K|5|fits my mazda perfectly
B00JTUBPC4|5|THE BEST !
B000RZO5FY|5|Got it for my husband's truck. Perfect!
B000CQFVRE|5|Awesome...check out the review for the bumper by me.
B00MB0EXGE|3|pink highs no longer pink, now beige, faded out.
B001HIHUAC|5|This fit my 1989 300SE just like OEM for a fraction of what the dealership was asking. Make sure you get the matching suppressor housing outer cover too, because it will cut down on moister getting to your plug ends, cap, and rotor. Plus, it's like $10. Just an FYI, this (of course) is just the housing and doesn't contain the cap.
B00KRQFI4U|5|Very nice quality. Happy. Cannot attest to prolonged quality but appears very adhesive and expect good long term quality.
B000C9WLLU|5|Fit perfectly. No Problems in the last 2 months since install.
B0030MYBNM|4|it adds a nice touch to my truck.
B00CZG6WO0|4|Everything went great, easy to install, my onlu concern is that they could of been brighter..
B000C2SDGY|4|I used this for my 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee 5.2L Limited.<br /><br />This kit is missing the 25.5mm ID o-ring from the main valve, so don't remove that o-ring if you don't have a replacement. Everything else is there in the kit as expected. The Teflon orange seal from the transmission (of the 1.18 inch diameter 46RE/46RH drive shaft to pump stator) fits almost perfectly in place of this missing seal. I pushed the valve in there a few times to trim the burr off the seal and it's working fine. Will probably last longer than the o-ring.<br /><br />Now I can turn my jeep with my index finger!<br /><br />Note that you have to &#34;feel&#34; the correct tightness when doing the adjustments if you don't have the torque measuring tools.<br /><br />Also be sure to use an inline transmission filter on the return hose. You REALLY want the security that any wear particles are going to be filtered out.<br /><br />Note that the 8/26/2015 episode of &#34;Wheeler Dealers&#34; features the Pontiac '65 GTO which has the same power-steering unit and was overhauled on camera. Unfortunately only a few minutes were spent on the overhaul of the unit.
B01187P6S4|5|Great product
B004M2UM64|5|Easy to assemble, very well made and sturdy.
B000BYGGVC|1|Each manufacturer recommends specific spark plugs in the Factory Service Manual.  The RECOMMENDED spark plug is the one you should use. Using a different spark plug, or a different plug gab, puts the ignition system's electrical characteristics out of balance. Some of the symptoms are:<br /><br />1. Failure to start due to overheated coil.<br />2. Engine cutting out in certain temperature ranges.<br />3. Coil failure.<br />4. Engine missing.<br />5. Misfiring at certain throttle patterns.<br />6. Pre-detonation.<br /><br />There are many fancy and gimmicky spark plugs on the market. They all perform better than stock plugs, but they require specific tuning of the coil and plug wires using a high-voltage OSCILLOSCOPE to be sure the spark current discharge pattern is what it's SUPPOSED to be -- typically only racing mechanics would go to this effort.  &#34;Upgrading&#34; the spark plugs alone is a VERY bad idea. You have to engineer the whole system -- this means using expensive wires, plugs, and a coil all designed to work together.<br /><br />So NEVER use &#34;fancy&#34; spark plugs of any kind EVER. And always replace your plugs at the interval specified in the Factory Service Manual: torque, gap, and lubricate according to Factory Service Manual instructions.<br /><br />(I had some of these above listed symptoms which lead me down a two week investigation into this matter.)
B00J4Z9JJU|5|worked as advertised.
B000FQ05V8|5|We were redoing my daughters 97 jeep and these were perfect. The old ones were so rusted that you could barely ope the door and with the new ones you could open and close with one finger. Great hinges.
B003YMRNXS|5|Once installed they have the old car running and braking like new.
B002PNSWMS|5|If you have a lifted Silverado, Tahoe or Suburban then you MUST have these.  These will be the last tie rods you will ever need to buy.  These are the strongest and most reliable I have ever seen and installed.
B000VU91SG|5|Fast shipping.  Truck bed mat arrived rolled up in clear plastic wrap.  No problem.  Put it in the truck bed and it was completely flat within a day or two.  Bed mat is cut to an exact fit for my pickup.  Heavy reinforced rubber product.  Completely satisfied with purchase and seller.
B0007Z4NRY|4|Good replacement. A bot tricky getting them it, but once you figure it out, they fit.
B005N6XHAG|5|Good buy.......
B00OW0UAJA|5|Great Keychain already received several compliments and it's holding up nicely.  Good buy for sure!
B00F66W82G|3|not a kit !!!!! just a plastic tank only.... nothing else..
B001O0AMZS|5|Great product
B00BEN2B5O|2|Valves did not work correctly at first. I had to take the valves apart and turn the diaphragm 180 degrees to make the valve work.
B002IZHDX2|5|Put this on a 1997 Mercury Force 40 hp. The OEM unit had 4 wires and this CDI unit has 5. Instructions explain how to make it work. It seems to work just fine. I liked not having to pay OEM price for this.
B000C9XZHO|1|I bought a Wix filter because I thought it was made in USA. The truck I put it on had a Wix filter that had been put on less than a year ago. I cut the filter open to inspect for debris and found the element had separated from the base plate and had allowed debris to continue on to the injectors. I'm done with chinese made Wix junk.
B00KTIUG5C|4|Worked well and got it on time. Instructions were easy to follow for programming the only problem  is one of the remotes the unlock button has to be pressed hard to get it to work no big deal bc it's a spare but the other one works great
B00HLM7G0M|5|Excelent product
B001XVGCP2|5|Its a very small battery. Came with the acid/chemical stuff. Charged it for 24 hours after adding fluid. Starts my 110cc atv very easily.
B000IYXJTW|1|AC Delco dropped the ball in my opinion on these.  These are cheap AND they are cheap. Should have known but was relying on the name to be a quality item.  Boy was I wrong. They should send the entire lot back and take their name off of junk like this and rebrand them as Tempfix, cause that's what it will be... a temp fix. The Terminals on battery ends are open to the air and not sealed. Ask any mechanic in the northeast or near the shore how well that will work in a year.  Maybe they will be fine in the desert. They should be molded to the cable like the OEM is.  Why do you think the OEM's have the rubber also sealing to the side battery? That's right folks to keep the air and moisture out!  These terminal covers work like an umbrella at best.  The Switch end is nothing more than stripped wire stuck into a cheap round tube and crushed flat with a hole drilled thru it.  Can you get any cheaper guys?  The factory is soldered first and then crimped with a REAL terminal. These are right up there with crap you buy from the local guys that have &#34;pro-rated&#34; the 4 &#34;lifetime warranty&#34; alternators you had to replace in 2 years.  Come on garbage is garbage.  I sent it back after seeing it.  Found new old stock to replace.<br />Folks if you buy junk they will only make and sell junk. Stop buying junk.
B00DCMM6VO|4|really like it so far
B008F85RD4|4|Its a godo product very useful
B00I61XPP2|3|It is really just  stickers on a plastic frame. I probably could have made this for a few dollars vs. the $10 I spent on this. It would probably start peeling fast so I put a few coats of clear outdoor rustolium over it to help it withstand the weather.  Still happy with it though.
B00XV4ZYLC|5|Nice jacket , little warm for right now but will be OK for fall
B00KUVPSJ2|1|NO ADJUSTMENT FOR AIR DISCHARGE FLOW DIRECTION! HAD TO TRIM THE OUTER PLASTIC FOAM COVER BEFORE THE SQUIRREL CAGE FAN WOULD ROTATE! THE LOCK ROTOR ON STARTUP DISCLOSED THIS LOUSY DESIGN AND QUALIT CONTROL.
B005KOZ25Y|5|this one works great, no need to spend a fortune on others
B000CIFVN6|4|works as described
B00JL8099Y|5|Easy install and look great
B001TYJOG2|1|too complicated to use.  i donated them
B000IOHHE0|3|matches the kuryakyn kickstand.  a must with the kuryakyn floor boards.
B000KQ2DVS|5|Superb.  No regrets!
B000S2U6QI|4|Works fine!
B000C30INY|5|Great price. Fast shipping. Thanks
B00VJ5DM7I|5|nice for the price
B00IACGFOA|4|so far so good been through a few lightening  storms no problems yet
B007XE5LTG|5|very good
B000UVCK9S|4|yeah there great
B00DP5JRSS|5|Just as expected.
B001DZ2OKA|5|Excellent.
B00NF18V8E|5|Perfect fit, like it so much I ordered another.
B0037Z3A48|5|Way cheaper than buying at an auto parts store. It was really a pain to install into my 2005 expedition, but totally do able in about 1.5 hours without removing the dash. you can get to it by removing the glove box and the heater controls / plastic dash fascia
B000M6TWQK|4|Although it did increase my seat time, it was not easy to get adjusted to get the maximum comfort. Either too much air or not enough.
B007AOSA06|5|Bret Tidwell -- 2013 F-150 Platinum 4x4 with black on pecan interior.  I probably read every review on the internet on several different brands of floor liners.  I wanted something as nice as my wife's new Acura MDX rubber floor mats.  The Husky x-act contour mats definitely fit the bill.  So, here is the basic description. Packaging is well done.  After opening the new mats there is little to no noticeable smell.  The mats are made of semi rigid and yet soft rubber compound. They are heavy enough to lay down well, but not so heavy they are cumbersome.  The  photo's do not show the nice looking texture that covers all of the surface.  Some rubber mats look cheep, these do not.  I purchased both he front and rear mats for my crew cab pickup.  The only negative I have is that the rear mat does not cover the entire carpeted area &#34;&#34;under&#34;&#34; the stoppable / liftable seats. I throw tools under the back seat occasionally and having the mats cover 100% would have been a plus.  I almost purchase the Husky weatherbeater mats because they do offer total coverage but I had read that they were a hard plastic similar to cheaper grade floor mats.  I highly recommend this product. In a market that is fairly crowded with competition . . . . Husky has set themselves as the &#34;leader of the pack&#34; in my opinion.
B00KUL73DG|1|Does not fit vehicle. Make sure you compare with you old filter before ordering and use the same Brand Stock Numbers.
B003VGHB9I|5|Great price and fit like the factory
B000CPCC3Q|5|Worked as advertised. Box clearly states which cable does what.
B007LFPMLO|5|Very cool collar for my Subie dog.
B00OUJ5LCO|5|Works, looks good, and fits great! was shipped fast!
B000GD5FMY|5|works great
B001Y93RKQ|5|These non-oem covers were easy to install and look good. After installing, just make sure that they are actually on and not loose. They were installed on a 2007 Camry.
B00CFALFXY|3|Absorbency is ok, I have had better. Price seems pretty high for the quality. The size is also a down side, you have to use them folded, and it's a pain to wash them (by hand).
B00BLAG3D6|3|Very bright light. Brightest light I've seen. But it DOES NOT REMEMBER last pattern used. If you don't want both lights to flash the same time you need to push button on back too many times.
B000B68V6I|5|Works great.  Just wish they would figure out a formula to last longer than 12 months as there competitors have.
B002OUMVWY|5|Works just like it should.
B009AA9XHC|5|Watch for video on youtube
B002YL9Q80|5|Great no shipping
B008OIS8JU|4|Perfect
B00PSD3TZW|4|Fit on my 2006 cobalt ss sc fine.
B000CI4XMG|5|Great item installed with ease and I'm not a mechanic I do a few things on cars this was the first time replacing a caliper and it did not take me long to install.
B00J594B5C|5|used it before
B00E6AC5VW|5|Just as promised.  I am very proud to display the sticker.
B00KL5H14C|1|air filter does NOT fit the blower as stated..not even close...ended up buying one at Stihl.
B002G2261G|5|Works for me!
B000EQ8V56|5|Excellent, tough shocks, I hope they last as long as my last Monroe shocks, which were put on another truck in 1997 and still going strong. Shipping was extremely fast. I saved $30, buying these on Amazon!
B006X21BH0|3|Chorme ball and holder had scratching in it contacted Anderson and have not gotten back with me. But as the product it is great pretty easy to set up and use.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|They are bright but definitely not super bright.
B00NC8UEY4|5|Great product.... Fit perfect for my jeep wraner tj 2000... It look awesome..
B00YI3IGA6|5|These are definitely the coolest and easiest to use car shades I have ever laid my eyes on. These are absolutely awesome! They not only are extremely easy to use but work great. With other sunshades you have that area around the shade that still lets in the light, with these it's just not possible. I watch my nieces and nephews often(whom are all under 3) and between them and my own kids I truly have tried over ten different shades over the years. Theses slip right over my door with no problems(I have big doors, I drive a durango).The kids can see out just enough that they aren't bored, but they can also relax and nap and not be in full alert mode when the time comes. Since these are made of material I can shove them in a bag when not using them and not worry about damage. I can also wash them if need be.  With dirty little fingers touching everything and the rapid changing weather being able to wash these is a big plus!!! I have had numerous people ask where I got these and they are quite impressed with the price they are charging. the quality is really nice too, the stitching is tight and very strong material was used in manufacturing.<br /><br />*I received these sunshades at discount for a HONEST review.
B00CJHFL2Y|3|Correct size and all of the mounting holes are in the right places, but very thin and flimsy compared to the OEM part it replaced, which was more rigid.  But it's also half the price of the OEM part, so I guess you get what you pay for.  I suppose time will tell about its long-term durability.
B002MEYKXU|5|Good fit and finish
B005ETCYYC|5|What  Honda calls for
B008Y604XA|1|This is a horrible buy. The advertised picture and the toy that's sent is nothing a like. My son thought this was a real bike however it was a very small toy.
B000BQR8TE|5|Solved my problem as expected!  Good quality.
B00THNA9WU|2|Good mirrors they are the 2nd pair that I have purchased. The adhesive could be better though. I had to get the second pair because the first pair fell off after a few weeks of driving.  As soon as I received the second pair I switched the adhesive it came with and replaced it with 3M adhesive now they stick on much better.
B001AS2798|5|nice left and right skulls, love them
B001QIUGVI|1|This device lasted just over a year and died.<br />The warranty period is one year.<br />How convenient!<br />The scanner worked the three times I used it and then the screen went blank.<br />Purchased this Aug 10, 2014. Tried to use it today Aug 23, 2015 and the screen is blank.<br />Called customer support and they confirmed that it is dead due to an &#34;internal problem&#34; (Translation = Poor design, known issue, not built to last).<br />CS said that it is only warranted for 1 year from date of purchase and they would require $89.99 to look at it once i send it in.<br />This is just another example of junk electronics sold to consumers that has a bad design and poor life cycle testing.<br />Anything that costs this much should be expected to last longer than a year.<br />I told him that I would throw it away and buy one from a reputable company.
B0000AXNMO|5|Great product, still working after many car washes.<br /><br />Water just beads up and blows away.<br /><br />This is a wiper blade saver.
B000UKFEXS|5|I keep this on hand at all times
B00IDFDW86|3|Little awkward for one person to put into place or take down.
B0041DXAI6|5|Came in about a week with the mounting bolts and the pins to secure the window.<br /> I could not determine where it was made, but it came to me from Syracuse NY<br />Works fine and I'm Very Happy with the purchase
B0013REXSO|5|Good product
B002UUZCNS|5|Great Product!
B00NQ99UU8|5|Perfect fit
B00GJ1E5ZK|5|Fit my 04 Canyon perfectly.<br />Adapter cable was included (as pictured) to allow easy connection to stock wiring plug on truck.
B001EOV46K|4|Maybe a bit of a tight fit. Usually takes a few seconds to get it aligned so it can be inserted in the receiver. Otherwise quite happy with the product.
B003WGRNFE|5|The switches work fine, easily installed, and the price was very good
B00H6ETIWY|3|These seem to be good quality mirrors but they will not not a can-am commander. That is why they only got three stars.
B0084UJK0E|5|Perfectly fit and looks good on my 2007 Chevy Suburban.
B00LNDRN12|5|Great, will use again.
B00C8YXH9C|5|Good quality
B004JKOQPW|5|Heavy Duty!
B006NB6ZNG|5|Perfect.
B00HWI7IXU|1|👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
B001N2O3PM|5|Well built and solid plate.
B001P29O5Y|5|I am completely satisfied with it.<br />It did fit My Curt Hitch and my Dodge Journey 2014.<br /><br />I did select it by its 2&#34; couple System to My hitch, no need for additional barsto place 4 Bikes on The Pro Series; but, You need a bit of imagination.<br /><br />I recomend it !!!!
B007XP1446|5|After finally getting a mk1 scirocco I was filled with joy. I was soon a bit distraught as I could not find quality replacement axles or rebuld kits anywhere! So I did my homework and found this empi. The &#34;Tube&#34; of the axle is not as large as factory, but it is of excellent quality and has been on my mk1 for a few thousand miles with zero issue. Its been through a few high speed runs, lots of burnouts and hard braking with ZERO issues.
B013IM9SU4|1|it did not work on my 2015 LS Traverse. the hex bolt with welded plate were too big for the holes(too much to modify). the left rear bracket plate  will be installed between the brake lines and cars body. and the metal underneath the car is not thick enough. and  the  hole for the &#34;Z&#34; bracket is sprayed w/ foam. had to pay my own shipping to return it. amazon says I will get a store credit from them for the shipping. w/c is still a bummer.<br />the reason I bought this because when I check the item  for compatibility it says &#34;it fits&#34;
B003O6SJEQ|5|Very good
B009AA23JC|5|Perfect!
B00LG0M7XQ|2|Description says a 9V snap is included but when opening it up there is NO 9V Snap in the package.
B01114V3BI|5|It Found codes that the basic OBD II PocketScan could not find. Spend the money and get a scanner that goes deep, this one does!
B0039Z1UHA|3|This wrap is high quality titanium woven. One tip I would have for anyone wanting to purchase is to buy more than you think is required.  If leave the job half done it causes major heat venting under the hood of your vehicle. So if you are going to wrap your headers and collector take them off your vehicle and do them all at once. This is thr most efficent and time saving method for installig the wrap. Dei also has youtube videos to walk you through installation. I gave it 3 stars due to the fact the company dosent give you any real guidance on how much to purchase and you have to purxhase clips to secure the wrap separately which can get expensive.
B002H9CMCQ|5|good product
B00B0WZJIU|5|Great plug, way better than the ones I've picked up locally.
B008KYY1IK|1|Do not buy this product... this is a piece of junk... i use it one month and after that the lock gets stock... i was in a trip, lock my bike for the night and next day couldn't get it unlock, had to break it in order to take my bike, witch by the way it took me 12 seconds to to break it with an electric cutter... protection my ass... try to return it and complain to the manufacture the manufacture told me to return it from where i bought it, of course i mist my window to return this piece of s***  ... waste of time and money
B0006O2S8M|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B009AQS5JS|5|Good quality.
B00CGGXRK6|5|No if ands or butts about it. This is by far the best Tonneau cover on the market. Fit and finish is perfect, mounts in about 20 minutes. I would buy another if we get another truck. Hands down the best on the market.
B00KV7FMNC|5|I ordered this sunshade for our 2012 Chevy Sonic. It was easy to open, fit the windshield very well, and kept our dashboard, seats, and overall car interior extremely cool on a 90 degree day (which was much appreciated with having a car seat in the car). I also enjoyed the shipping confirmation e-mail I received from the company, with instructions on how to fold (a bit tricky but worth playing around with to get the hang of it) the sunshade, and what to expect from the product. It isn't flimsy or cheap like some of the accordion-style shades are, and my husband and I found the sunshade to be of a nice material, very flexible, and quite durable.<br /><br />I contacted Lif Products when a problem arose during my checkout. Irene, the Product Manager, answered my e-mail inquiry quickly, efficiently, and professionally. Being in the retail industry for 10 years, you learn to appreciate good customer service, and Irene definitely was courteous, helpful, and made me feel confident with my purchase from Lif Products. What an asset to the company!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this sunshade to those looking for a way to beat the heat by keeping their car nice and cool. The company stands behind their product, listens to customers, and conducts business in an honest and customer-centric way. I look forward to ordering more of their products!<br /><br />I know a lot of people reading &#34;I purchased this item for a review&#34; are hesitant to believe us reviewers, however I'd like to say:  I'm expected to leave an honest and unbiased review, whether positive or negative. I am under NO obligation from the individual seller or from Amazon to write a positive review, and the positivity/negativity of my review does not impact me in any way. I only purchase items I actually use in my household and give honest reviews regarding pros and cons. All opinions expressed are my own, based on my use with the product. I'll be happy to answer any follow up questions to the best of my ability.<br /><br />As my personal rule of thumb:<br />I award 5 stars to products that exceed my expectations and that I would repurchase again at full price.<br />I award 4 stars to products that can be improved but overall work well and are up to par. These I would still repurchase at full price.<br />I award 3 stars to products that are mediocre and I would NOT repurchase at full price.<br />I award 2 stars to products that are underwhelming and definitely would NOT repurchase at full price.<br />I award 1 star to products that do not work correctly and should not be on the market.of thumb: I award 5 stars to products that exceed my expectations and that I would repurchase again at full price. I award 4 stars to products that can be improved but overall work well and are up to par. These I would still repurchase at full price. I award 3 stars to products that are mediocre and I would NOT repurchase at full price. I award 2 stars to products that are underwhelming and definitely would NOT repurchase at full price. I award 1 star to products that do not work correctly and should not be on the market.
B000PKZ8EI|5|Very Good Product
B003L31RK0|5|Goes well with Royal purple oil
B001RUW4GU|5|It fit our cup holder (which isn't super big) and allows some extra space to hold items. My phone (HTC One) fits. I also bought the soft cupholder and this one is better. The soft one flops over.
B000I04Z7Q|4|4 stars only because it doesn't come with the necessary equipment to install it. Such as tape, ties, or an add-a-circuit. Realistically I only spent an extra 10 bucks on said equipment, so it wasn't too bad. Fantastic colors, easy setup, multiple functions. These are a great addition to my beautiful Stealth. Music chasing function doesn't follow the best very well, it's rather sporadic & random, but fun nonetheless. With the 1 year warranty these are well worth it.
B00AZMH2MC|4|There's always a question of fit on this type of part. This fit perfectly. I would normally buy the O.E. brand, but I don't have a job. This is good alternative.
B00USC2CEW|5|Put it on my KTM 300 works great there was a switch there just fabed it to fit no problems
B00BITJHR4|5|GREAT

B001NZT36S|5|perfect
B00IIVUXLO|5|The three compartments make this ideal for many uses including groceries.
B00S8FSKCY|1|I had ordered the first one and it worked fine for two days......then it fried from massive corrosion.......they sent me a replacement at no charge and again the siren worked for two or three days then stopped due to corrosion......this item is not worth anyones time or money
B00IWKUUBO|5|Very fast delivery. Happy with the product. Installed it in a second with no problem.
B00G620ZVU|5|These lights are all they said they are, very bright very clean very solidly built, no water problems yet, have them very low on my cruise in the front, very bright, would definitely buy again

B0009IQZFM|5|Good stuff!
B0068ODC1Q|4|Good product, good prce
B000E0ZAZQ|5|Excellent product and excellent transaction,,, Thanks!!!
B00KF9180W|5|My fiancee bought these for skiing. I thought they looked ridiculous, but it was a very cold day so I tried one on. I'm glad I did, these are incredible. I used this on many below freezing days working as a cable technician in snow blowing winds on telephone poles. Highly recommend, especially for the prices. Sturdier than I expected.
B000UKKTEC|5|Fit perfectly. Seems to be working
B00J4TXE8I|1|Do not get this bulb it's terrible I plugged in the bulbs and turned it on there not bright And not white

B001O7PNW8|5|good stuff
B0085G9P84|5|Good value for the price
B006LO7YM6|5|Battery shipped fast and was ready to use right out of the box. The warranty info was in with battery and it has a 1 year free replacement warranty with 6 months prorated on top of that. I couldn't be more happy I have been using it for a few days now and has not let me down. I will be getting all of my battery's from here now
B00JGJGIKW|5|Purchase this cable to add a Quick Disconnect for my RV. This cable is well built and flexible.
B004TXS0SS|4|Fit perfect on my BMW R1200 GS Adventure to put on an extra pair of lights.
B00T94BKFW|1|It looks good but a bulb stopped working after a month
B0074E2IKA|5|Really cute plush dog. The size is very decent. I have this displayed behind my Jetta MK4.
B004IYC5HU|4|I the foot for the jack is a little larger in diameter than the whole in the trailer tongue, had to grind out the hole but other than that it works just fine.
B00JPS6Y9E|5|All is good!
B009OBVS2K|5|Worked better than I expected.  Used it on a black car with a dual action polisher that had water spots all over.  This stuff even took off some bird crap stains that I thought were never coming off.  I was planning to do another pass with scratch remover, but I didn't even have to because this took out most of the fine scratches as well.
B00BGZ4C4S|5|Works grate
B00DNDBJVK|3|you get what you pay for, I used them to make a pet door flap in my garage door, cheaper than an actual pet door! i would never use these in my car as they are way to thin !
B00TGVZ0I6|2|Cracked. Junk packaging
B005ZJFZIS|5|5 star
B000NCOKZQ|5|works as advertised
B002SB02PC|5|Fits perfectly!
B00AF67MSC|1|these lights are good but the colors they promote are false.  There is no purple like they advertise  I returned them
B000CGDCLG|5|great product , fit and work fine , and the price when purchased was amazing .
B00AJHF46E|5|Special
B006BVK1NS|5|Fit my 2007 R1200R like a glove, seems to have a little better initial bite.  Way more reasonable than OEM BMW pads!
B00LUZB9LI|3|Hard to keep top open while emptying it otherwise its quite durable and works well. The problems others mentioned about the blue light not being bright enough or last long enough before burning out was not a problem I experienced.
B00BO92D2E|4|They are just what they said they are. Work great.
B00MY3YYL2|4|Great quality product met my expectation! Recomend.
B00RU9H1MY|2|Didn't fit my 04 Honda civic however I got it to fit with a little extra cutting looks good once it is in though
B00IFPKCFK|5|This worked great, found a dealership to program it. Saved me a lot of money
B000B8N3MI|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Audi A8L (and yours as well, for that matter)!
B00H6XPZN6|4|I have a Nissan Versa, and this is just a little too big for my rear window. It covers most of the window, but is kind of jammed in there to fit. I do love it though, and my daughter loves that her seat isn't as hot!
B0083Z2S7M|4|Works on my 2002 ez go golf cart. Had to add one additional filler layer of inner tube thickness. Mine is mounted at the 6 position outside the wheel. (The steering column on a golf cart is so much toward the vertical that the outside mount will never interfere with driver's lap.)<br /><br />One other heads up: the more layers of padding there are, the more difficult it is to line up the screw going into the knob. 4 hands may help.<br /><br />Spinning function is great. Very good bearing. Had it one day so.<br /><br />Only reason to take away a star.....and this is personal usage related only.....is that the knob is such a great diameter that the smaller hands in our family will struggle with it.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works flawlessly coupled with Torque Pro on the Nexus 7 in my 2002 GMC Yukon XL. Connected to BT without issue and under 60 seconds in Torque it had made all 3 connections. Added a few widgets and they are all working wonderfully.<br /><br />Don't waste time and money on the agate and other cheaper knockoffs. For $23 this is the one to have.<br /><br />Be warned, it's not the mini so make sure you have room for it. On my SUV it sticks out under the steering hub and all lights are visible, which is nice to have a visual reference.
B004N6K92Q|5|Great timing on delivery  but I only ordered one set somehow I got two.
B00TQ07IOQ|3|Not the best in quality. But for the price it's a great deal! They get the job done
B00LUS7PKY|5|Came on time, and were easy to install, have in the vehicle over 4k miles now without any issues. I was glad to see that they had a package to purchase both at the same time, it was a good management decision. I will order from this seller again.
B00UPCG0L6|5|Fitted my damaged spade perfectly.
B002R8FTR2|5|Great product.
B00F4A2YJG|5|Cool gauges, adjustable brightness for day or night viewing, easy to read with needle for analog viewing or what I like is the digital number for a quick<br />check.
B00CD2RMVI|1|The rubber that goes between the fender flair and the body of the truck will not stay on! So not to scratch the truck I took them off! Really bad design!
B000CB06VA|5|What can you say about an ignition coil. I worked.
B002Y2SGJE|5|The best ever
B0002SQYTG|5|Fits tight to valve stem with minimum pressure, for fast measurement. Very accurate pressure readings with easy to read numbers. Great value at 3X the price.
B0000AZ8JB|3|This was a little  small
B00O0EG9FW|5|So far it perfectly fit into my toyota corolla 2012 car and works fine.
B00842A7F4|5|Wonderful
B007SGAUJA|5|works, great sticker.
B00L7UYKTY|5|These are awesome,genuine Yamaha part.The other brand we all know as B.B. is over a hundred bucks more.These are made for our bike,They do a great job keeping your legs cool.Nothing could do more than these do.I know B.B. makes some for over a hundred bucks more.
B00SV0CZNQ|3|Button on the seat belt in the car popped off and the buckle kept sliding to the floor. Pain in the neck getting it ever time.<br />Had to use a small nail to make a new hole (Couldn't find the old one)  Snapped together and gave a little squeeze with a plier. Done.
B0040CYWX0|5|Excellent product. They are OEM, so they work perfectly. Bought them to replace some ones on my dad's truck that was involved in an accident. Would definitely recommend these!!!
B00029J5F0|3|Right size nozzle but the base of the nozzle leaked fuel, tried both new gaskets and my old ones still leaked when. Runs good so I'm not too concerned.
B000NVW1LM|1|I discovered that the bottom of my Suzuki had a slow, tiny leak. I put about a half a bottle of this stuff in and now the leak is much bigger. It was worth a try, but it looks like a waste of money to me.
B00J7RB72M|2|I expect better quality... It's cheap
B001P2F3XQ|4|It is really the only one I have found that fits my kingpin. It has worked well so far although I feel like it doesn't just fit right.
B00C5TPZLI|5|Very nice product. Great value compared to other brands.
B00ID9RF8U|1|This box is a piece of crap. Flimsy aluminum and all of the latches bend easily. I spend so much time trying to bend the latches back into the right position so it will close every time I open it to get something out of it that by this point I would have rather spent 2-3 times as much for a better box. I can bend the sides of the box in and out with my hands. DON'T BUY THIS BOX. You'll regret it, I do.
B004B0C1NE|5|This has paid for itself many times over. I have been able to see what the actual error code is and reset the computer to see if it returns.
B00LL6PK2K|5|This is so cool! I was asked to review this, and I was thrilled to do it. This is a fantastic device. Why? Because it lights up! Now I know I am not the only one that has had a low tire in the evening! Well traditional gauges can be hard to read. Well this one lights up and had a digital read out! #TPG<br />Very easy to use. Just click on the black button that is located just above the grip handle. Before you try and check your tire, please make sure the valve cap on the valve on your tire is off. Press gauge hard down on valve to make sure you have a tight seal. And Bingo! You just have to look down to see what the pressure is in your tire. If it is low, go to where you can get air in the tire, and fill it up to the recommended pressure the tire manufacturer of the tires you have on your car recommends. Remember to check your tires weekly, it is just smart maintenance on your car and it could increase your gas mileage Please note I did receive this free of charge to give my honest opinion on it.
B005FN228K|1|Not very good quality.
B00XBCSZ9W|5|Fits perfect! Very nice. Had it installed and it works so nice at night time.
B00SISKG82|5|Great thanks.
B00XZ9PLQG|5|Took to locksmith $25 to laser cut. Took transponder chip out old remote, put in new one. Works great, you have to have chip or get it programmed by locksmith as it won't start car, some kind of anti-theft. Saved lots of money.
B00G4L23PY|2|This ones are better than oems, but the high beam on one of the bulbs burn out in 2 months.
B00KY0GF46|5|Great product, fast shipping.
B001DH8204|3|No instructions as to how to instal
B007IVRWPK|5|It fit perfectly for my 2008 Camry Hybrid. Installation was a piece of cake.
B00MMCDIVC|4|The holder looks decent on the windshield and as of to date, the velcro is holding on nicely.
B00MGTS1WW|5|Was great on the trip and it folds up when the luggage is removed, just the right size
B00MWM52UM|2|Two stars to my pair of shoes!! I'm sure not all pairs are the same but I received mine today, very fast by the way but not very happy with the look of them, last pair on size 5.5 $85.00 dls and got this!! Two different blue, worn sole/insole!! If is the last pair and look like thi,  sell them for $30 dollars, at least I wouldn't regret of paying $30 instead of $85..ill keep them just because i like the style but not happy at all.
B00853A6FI|5|Took me 5 min to change it. And it works great.
B000M5YZKO|5|does what it should.  Solid tool.  No problems.
B003V5KKH4|4|Good mirror, will serve its purpose. Wish it telescoped a little bit longer.Better than round small mirror and gives a good view.
B001DKQZCS|4|Really helpful to get rid of snow on top of my Jeep. Ide scrapper part is just ok and not comfortable though.
B00BK24IJG|5|These pants worked awesome.  They kept he dry in a massive rain storm on the Million Dollar Highway.  I would recommend these pants to anyone.
B001FENUNE|3|Disappointed that the boots would not stay in place on either ball joint. I've installed dozens of ball joints in the past, and usually am very satisfied with MOOG, but these just would not cooperate.
B00HVHF6AE|5|AAA<br />nice color!!!
B0002MBKUK|4|Looks good on my bass boat.
B000C7ZDB2|5|works great and fit with no problem
B002R4NJ8C|1|I have previously bought the same bulbs, and these I got recently are far inferior, instead of a blue tint, it was yellow.<br />I am very disappointed.
B00A740VQM|3|does not have magnetic tips so the screws come off easily works ok
B004R30E0W|5|Love it.Came faster than expected and was packed good.No bent parts installed in one hour and got my 5th wheel off my truck.I would recommend this to anyone that needs a new Jack system.
B007DBVU0I|5|Perfect fit, just like the OEM units they replaced at a quarter of the price.
B00ELASYIA|5|Haven't needed to use them yet but am impressed with sturdiness of the cables and hardware and that they come with not only a handy storage bag but also a pair of gloves, complete with a grippy palm side, to keep your hands clean while using them!
B005N221G6|4|LOVE THE COLOR BUT IT'S NOT GREAT ON THE EYES. (IMPERSONATING AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE) IT ALMOST GOT ME A TICKET BECAUSE OF THE COLOR.
B00F9LPIAC|5|Very compact & light. Easy to use
B00FOSSLHW|5|opti lube was as good as expected
B000O0I10W|5|This was exactly what we needed for our 2001 Ford Expedition.
B00NXENJOY|5|This looks great on my visor.  Its a nice blue color with brown leather strap.
B009KP77WU|5|Works great. The hardest thing about installation is running the power wire.
B002CMN4GG|5|i still got it. works well
B00ZAQXS26|5|Looks great!😃
B00EUZQZ78|5|Good product fit is true to size marked

B003BLUBUY|5|Is a very nice looking red keychain that goes well with my car electrical keys.
B000NW4PXI|5|Bought this to replace a cheap Chinese part someone installed two years earlier.  Solved their hard start issue.
B00W6CWLV6|5|We're being labeled now.  I'm sure that makes some wizards happy.
B00W56D8WY|5|Fantastic quality at a great price. I really wasn't expecting them to be this nice for 60 bucks. Everything fit perfectly and the finish looks real good. The shipping was faster than expected too. Only took 8 Days.
B00G7ROWEA|5|I really should give it one star...it doesn't work! I continue to put up with bulls**t even though the stickers I have CLEARLY indicate a lack of tolerance for it.
B002XFVVLC|2|glass off the mirror does not hold in place as it is has to be(broken holders on the inside)
B002UZGCSW|5|Mann filters are always great.  I'll certainly be buying more of these.
B000P6URUC|5|I have been using this for several years now. It goes on nice and heavy to provide an excellent base for blocking and filling in imperfections. Provides a nice smooth surface once sanded. Its getting hard to find due to the VOC issues in some states so some suppliers no longer carry it which is why i ordered it on amazon. Overall this has been 1 of the best primer / surfacers I have used. I did have to get a 2.2 tip for my gun as the 1.8 provided a texture on the dry side. The 2.2 sprays nice and wet. You do need to throroughly mix the primer before use and again when you mix it with the activator.
B004HXFUUQ|5|clicked right in the front grill of our 2011 Altima.
B0051UAM0M|5|It was good
B009SAOL5I|5|Bought for JK last winter. I have a snowdogg snowplow and these worked great to keep from sagging.
B004RNOVTM|5|We use these at a beach shower. Lasted 2 years so far. Love that they are not too long. They hold up in the sun great!
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Works great for me! Not too big but enough to room to hold a little trash and keeps the Kleenex convenient.
B0091NL53S|5|Fit and worked as expected
B0007XU4EC|1|The first one that I purchased did not work at all,  they have me a replacement promptly!  That one is now not working either,  it only lasted 2 months and went out.  I think I am going to look for another brand.
B00230D6KQ|2|This style switch is the only one I could use for my application.  It's poorly assembled with the wires not crimped well.  When I went to attach my connector the internal connection wire was short, not crimped in both ends of the connector and came loose.  I had to order another and know I need to be more careful.
B0077FIZGC|1|The part failed.wasnt good.needed to purchase another at a local auto parts store. It sits in my toolbox after waiting 10 days for delivery. Disappointed
B001U2DPUE|4|Didn't notice any more chanel's but the ones that I did get had LOT better signal strength.
B0070Y35OC|1|The one piece back glass is not fit my car<br />Its smaller than the glass
B00407V4I6|5|I have a 2009 fusion and this is pretty darn close to the color. I'm not sure if the entire car color changed due to so much sun exposure, so this paint was a tad off, but better than trying to match it in the store or by myself.
B00W9B4CG6|4|i love the way this looks in a car the blue light at night looks grate and is a very good change from the normal clear lights.
B007RET558|5|Excellent
B00WXBYYR4|5|Nothing like being able to fix your car's AC yourself for very cheap.  This Freon worked great.  Funny when I tried to order another set they would not allow it to be sent to California.  (Hint -try eBay)
B0015S88RI|5|Perfect
B00S75A5IW|5|bright lights very please with the led light ... i have them on my tundra and my cbr1000rr highly recommend  it
B0031GL2MU|5|Fit perfect on 2009 JK, great value.  Update: Okay I am a rookie but I installed it in about  hour most of the time I spent trying to unplug the sensor because it was located behind the shock tower (patience) and also the Chilton book did not tell me to remove the plastic guide that is on the front right axle so when I attempted to put back together it would not go. I used a coat hanger and fished out the plastic guide that was inputted at factor and reinstalled front axle. Took me a while to research online to find out about that little plastic guide. Don't make the same mistake, other than that was easy install.
B002BHRXJ6|5|Good quality
B000CIQ5DG|1|This pump was installed for less than a month and was ran for less than 1 hour and failed. When it stopped working, the stock mechanical pump couldn't pull enough fuel through it to run the truck, which is not typical. This pump was added as a booster pump to eliminate vapor lock in hot weather.  Amazon makes me go through the manufacturer, and they want you to send the supposed bad pump back along with the filter or screen that was to be put on before the pump.  I won't be buying this pump again, at least from Amazon.  Probably get one locally so if there's any warranty issues I don't have all the hassle as with this one.
B002RNASD2|5|It's great, exactly what I ordered.  Delivered on time and it was as described.  I would recommend it for anyone.
B0031XHPOW|3|easy to install, did all it was suppd. to do.
B00KTIZK30|5|Easy to program and exactly like the factory OEM ones we received years ago.
B000JFJLP6|5|Great product.
B0057PFJW2|5|Very good quality and easy to fit!
B00EC0XTBG|4|Installed easily, with good instructions.
B00NIMFTOE|3|The wiring is to complicated
B003KRCKPS|1|I bought this fuel filter for a 97 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0 since Amazon and Omix-Ada both said that it would fit my vehicle.  Well, I am here to say that it does not.  According to my Haynes Repair Manual (93-00 Grand Cherokee), only 93-96 Grand Cherokees use the inline fuel filters.  97-00 Grand Cherokees' filter is located in the fuel tank as part of the fuel pump assembly.  I would recommend that if Amazon or Omix-Ada says that it fits with your vehicle, check under your vehicle first to verify that you have an inline filter.
B003NI15E6|5|Perfect replacement lift support for my 2001 Ford F150 for the hood support
B00092893E|5|I'd noticed some jerking when attempting to accelerate in my rav 4. I guessed it might be a buildup creating uneven gas spray. I looked around at all the options and this looked like the best. Added before fueling and half a tank later I can already feel the difference. Acceleration is DRASTICALLY smoother. Am buying for wives car.
B0009H51PI|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B0000AY88C|5|As described and delivered quickly.
B00GWFPQCE|5|I'm really happy with these floor mats in my 2014 crewmax. Fit great and stay in place like they should.
B007P73YSG|5|Perfect fit for my 1997 Ford Expedition V8 5.7L (confirmed with seller by providing my VIN)
B01463WLBW|3|It's okay. Honestly haven't had chance to put in car. Nothing fancy. Doubt with my family the material will last long though. Hope it fits. When I first scoped it out & checked to see if it fit my car I said it would, but when I pulled it up again it said it doesn't. Odd...
