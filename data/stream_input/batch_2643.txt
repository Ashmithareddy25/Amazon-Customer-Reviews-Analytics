B0084670FU|2.0|I enjoyed Crash, but this movie was just depressing. The movement between storylines in the beginning of the movie made it difficult to follow the story lines, until a more time was spent with each character set.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love love love the Crossfire series and the intensity of the characters!!! Keep them coming Sylvia! If you like Fifty Shades, you'll love this series!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Engaging game with lots of incentives.  Seldom boring.  Lots of opportunities to earn credits without cash. Good community of players. Worth exploring.
B00979CS50|5.0|This release is as close to the 70's Neil Young and Crazy Horse as it gets! The music sounds great and the long jams are packed with some powerful lyrics and guitar work!
1616550414|5.0|I really wanted the Japanese version of this book but that one was way out of my price range. My husband really loves his book and it has become a multipurpose book. He is reading it but he is also drawing the pictures from it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Wow, beautiful game and it just helps you relax . Would recommend it to anyone, anytime at any day<br />But it does take time to accomplish some tasks.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very fun....not crazy hard, but that makes it less frustrating. It is a short trial, ambit I am going to purchase full version because it is a good game.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Saw this one twice in the theaters, great movie. Good writing, effects are pretty good.<br /><br />Gotta love a leaving may who's catch phrase is &#34;oh, crap!&#34;
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love finding things in this game... the only problem I have is the need to have friends to earn things and trade things out... I personally don't like that... I just like to play the game...
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Wonderful story. Great actors. Beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />I loved Milan Kunis, James Franco and Zach Braff's characters.  The were great choices.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fun for me and my two year-old, when he gets his hands on it!  Recommended for Samsung Galaxy SIII phone.

B00005LASK|5.0|This album is Cat Stevens' masterpiece.<br />His lyrics are heartfelt. The music is engaging, catchy.<br />A wonderful tapestry of thought and emotion.<br />If you have ever thought that you liked any of Cat Stevens' songs<br />then you need to add this album to your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is great and helps me stay awake when I'm bored. Different characters, boards, and locations every month! I highly reccomend this app if you like having fun.
B000WMA6FA|1.0|I got this for my dad for fathers day and it skips and pauses and will not continue playing! i am very dissapointed!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was so excited for this book to come out.  I had to wait about a week between finishing the second book and this one being released.  It was very good.  I was a little disappointed to find out that there would be a 4th book and the author hasn't yet set a release date for it, so now I feel like I'm in limbo and I will have to re-read the first 3 books all over since it doesn't seem like the 4th book will be out anytime soon.
B000PUXCPU|5.0|They sounded just like the old days. Great band and great singer. Helps us remember the good ole' days.Thanks for the memories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Damn! This game is so addictive that my wife is getting so mad at me bcoz im not listening to her anymore whenever im playing this game! Hehehe! Love you baby!
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones is a spellbinding fantasy that has really cool and detailed world-building. Before I picked this book up I had heard multiple opinions--some were good some were not so good. Since the reviews seemed mixed I just had to find out for myself what I thought of it. I liked each of the characters for various reasons especially Simon. Simon's relationship with Clary is cute and their banter is funny and full of sarcasm. He's Clary's closest and basically only friend and he's adorably nerdy, and the only \\"normal\\" human in the book. As for Clary I wanted to feel a connection and see that she was this badass in disguise but she wasn't. She has a lot of potential to be a tough and strong heroine but so far her courage and bravery is all she's got going--no fighting demons on her own just yet. The story itself is pretty complex, they're many different characters, and small subplots. Though City of Bones is nearly 500 pages long I flew through it without much effort. The story moves forward at a decent pace however their were some scenes I skimmed because they were pretty unimportant. It's written in third-person which took a little getting used to because normally I love first-person narration but it worked out well and I just forgot about it. City of Bones mostly focuses on Clary and Jace though I'd have loved to have seen some more of Simon. Jace is the bad-boy type, he's a trained Shadowhunter whose a skilled warrior, he's very handsome, and he is really arrogant. Normally I hate men who act like jerks and are full of themselves but it's his defense mechanism; he's a good person underneath. Clary and Jace have a strange and interesting relationship. Now onward to Jace's friends and his fellow Shadowhunters - Isabelle wasn't the nicest character of the bunch but towards the end she softened quite a bit. Despite her brother Alec being just as cold I admired his loyalty to Jace--always sticking up for him even when he was in the wrong.<br /><br />After witnessing some strange behavior in a club called Pandemonium Clary Fray investigates only to find her whole world turned upside-down. Trying to get back to her normal life a few days later she runs into the golden-haired guy from the club--Jace. He explains bits and pieces of what she saw the other night and that's when she gets the call. Her mother's been kidnapped and learning about the world of the Shadowhunter's seems to be the only way to get her back. Thrust into a world she never knew existed alongside her own Clary Fray soon discovers herself on a path her mother never wanted her to follow. As she begins to know more she learns of her past, discovers buried family secrets, and gets herself involved in a dangerous web of lies and truth.<br /><br />Up until the end of the novel I was loving how the story was going and then suddenly as it approached the end something shocking happened. I nearly threw my book straight across the room, and started chant-screaming NO-NO-NO! Why you ask? Well let's just say things got super weird and a little warped and I wasn't expecting things to turn out the way that they did. My problem was with the end and what the author tries to sell you--which I totally don't buy--but for readers sake it gets a little bumpy and throws you for a huge loop. Anyways, I bought the second book as soon as I finished this one because I needed to know the truth and how the mess gets resolved. A couple other tiny issues that bothered me were the inconsistent personalities of some of the characters. I wasn't feeling the sudden shift of behavior that turned the story inside-out and kind of made you go what the heck just happened? Since when does so and so act like this? I really enjoyed the creativeness of it all but unfortunately most of the writing didn't flow very well. I think that the intrigue of the story's concept, history, characters made me overlook these things since the rest was really entertaining which in a good book you can forgive it and I did.<br /><br />Overall the Shadowhunter world is extremely captivating with vampires, werewolves, demons, and other paranormal beings wandering the streets and blending into modern day--with multiple dimensions--New York City. There are betrayals, unexpected turns, some brewing romance, and some fun action scenes. I loved the idea behind runes which are basically tattoos that give you special powers--they are super neat! I would like to see more explanations in the following books to connect and understand everything clearly because I like puzzles to have all the right pieces. Though this is a novel for young adults their is some innuendos and violence but nothing too bad. All in all it's a gripping read with a beautifully described and imaginative world with a handful of interesting characters. Fans of Urban Fantasy & Paranormal genres should give this book a chance because it really differentiates itself from other stories. I'm hopeful and excited to find out more about Clary, Jace, and Simon and their strangely amusing lives. City of Bones will pull you right out of your reading slump and push you into an exciting adventure. You'll either love this book or hate it and that's just the way it is, but so far I'm a fan!r /><br />Overall the Shadowhunter world is extremely captivating with vampires, werewolves, demons, and other paranormal beings wandering the streets and blending into modern day--with multiple dimensions--New York City.

B003UBTX72|5.0|I listened to the audio version, and gave the Kindle version as a gift.  The book, which is quite lengthy, but never boring, lists Keith Richard's story from childhood to the present.  He kept diaries throughout his life, so recalled everything in great detail.  I was fascinated with his many experiences all over the world, his women, the detailed descriptions of song writing, performing, and his relationship with the Stones and hundreds of other artists.  Great read.
B003OBJV5W|5.0|The guys sounded exactly like they did in the 70's. The band was great , loved the Andy tribute. These guys were a class act, soo sad to lose so many of our great people.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James james james,<br />You have outdone yourself once again - your writing is astonishingly good,<br />Will be recommending this to many down under in NZ.<br /><br />Best<br />Valueroad
B007SGLZP8|5.0|He kept you guessing.  You surely couldn't guess how it would end. Grisham is a great author and I have read most of his books.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Looked at this movie some years back and enjoyed it greatly.  This time, I wanted to have it on hand for when I wanted something with substance, and...  great  acting.  These guys came through, and after many movies have come and gone, Papillon (the Butterfly) is a winner.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I find this app relaxing.  There are nice choices of sounds from which to select, such as rain, flute, piano, etc.  It makes for great background music and the timer feature on it is nice.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00005ASOC|3.0|The DVD looked like a fine cut and had sub titles.  I returned the DVD and requrested confirmation of receipt and wanted to get the sellers feedback.  I have not heard back from the seller and I'm not sure if I've been credited for the returned item.  This was my first time using this seller.<br /><br />Their customer service was excellent and their response times was prompt and courteous. The down side is that I'm still waiting<br />for their conformation of receiving the returned DVD.<br /><br />Everyone deserves a second chance, see how you like them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love all the characters! So much can happen in one house, keeps you on your toes! Can't wait for season four!
B004IK890Q|5.0|I loved it. Consistently intrigued and glued to every word Jodi wrote. I loved it and would recommend it to many friends.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I think I've already seen this movie over 6 times and it's still fun to watch. My kids and I made some popcorn, turned on the surround sound and had a blast watching it again.
B00BH4167Y|5.0|I received my Vinyl earlier than expected, and it was well  wrapped, perfect! It was just what I wanted. And I'm very happy with InAndOut Records.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very good.<br />good charcters and story.<br />lots of twists and turns some are predictible others not. Nice to see both sides of life then.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The size of P4G is unreal. I remember playing the original Persona 4 and putting in nearly 100 hours into that game. I like how in the middle of the game, you have access to a motorskooter and be able to go to more places, a big upgrade over the lack of non-dungeon exploration in Persona 4. The new social links, the Aeon and Jester, are pretty cool, too. Marie is quite an interesting character and I love how she was weaved into the game rather than being cut and pasted on. Other new stuff I liked were being able to go out during the evening, new personas, skill cards, costumes, and etc. The JRPG has been on serious decline over this generation, but P4G helps keep the genre afloat. Also, it has made me super pumped for Persona 5.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The instructions provided don't offer much help.  You have to touch each of the objects then figure out on you own what you have to do.  Once you do that, It's really a challenging game.  If you get stuck there are no clues to help you.  That's where I'm at now and can't go anywhere!!!  I'm forever doomed at Level 6, can't get the blue weight.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is really fun . Everything about it is great except the price.<br />$ 7.00 ! But trust me . It is worth it . Dont listen to any bad reviews.<br />And now they just added animals to creative mode . Awesome . But on the pc it is better because you can have horses , saddles , potions, and lots of other neat stuff . I guess that is why they call it the pocket addition !
B000002KXV|5.0|I first purchased this album way back in the day, when vinyl ruled the earth. It was my introduction to Fagen as a solo artist. I wore it out!  The time had come for a more state of the art version.<br /><br />Much like his 'Dan' work... here he was full of lively/ sly intelligentsia, swagger and retro-cool... and all those qualities come alive inside his vocals. This cat is NOT a great singer, yet he always has these Great Things to say, and he makes you think. He cleverly educates you with his references ('I hear you're wild about Brubeck') and with a little research you realize just how on-point his references are...<br /><br />Example from the \\"New Frontier\\":<br /><br />\\"Introduce me to that big blond... she's got a touch of Tuesday Weld...\\"<br /><br />Who???<br /><br />I'd no idea who Tuesday Weld was, but a little research provided just the right visual stimulation required to totally GET Fagen's allusion.<br /><br />He a cool educator like that.<br /><br />There are songs in this collection that possess enough wit, musicality and polish that they should have become sonic classics; songs like \\"The Goodbye Look\\" , the aforementioned \\"New Frontier\\", \\"I.G. Y.\\" and his cooler-than-the-original version of the Dion & The Belmonts hit \\"Ruby Baby.\\" Again, it took a little research to discover Fagen was not the first artist to record the song, only his take is so definitive that it's the only one you hear inside your head.<br /><br />Fagen makes the music matter.<br /><br />Quite simply, this dude IS The Coolness.<br /><br />One.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|I found the plot stupid' immature and boring. I was very disappointed because the movie had been recommended yo me.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|A very fast read fable about time, and the difference between life and living. Fairy tale story with lessons that every child should be introduced to. Through the process of story telling we capture a portion of a truth that we would like to impart. This is a repetition of what we know, but a Times choose not to think about.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is beyond addictive. My six year old and I love it. It is fun and engaging for both of us.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|HAVE FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE PICTURE OF  THING IM LOOKING AT. IT HARD TO GET  YOUR  SUBJECT LINED UP TO SHOOT.
B00119ZMKW|2.0|Can't wait to watch the next episode.  My advice, you need to start with season 1 if you haven't  seen this show before. You really get hooked, never know how it turns out
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|What can I say that probably hasn't already been said, but I'm gonna try.  This album sounds as if they never split after Never Say Die.  Tony's guitar, Geezer's bass, Ozzy's vocals, and Brad's drums (while of course aren't Bill's [Ward] are a damned good imitation).  The lyrics show thought and insight.  The music is the hardest and heaviest of any around.  Despite all the craziness, the issues, and what not, they can still do the job-rock!  The End Of The Beginning sets the tone and it doesn't stop: hard, heavy, in your face.  Zeitgeist, is this albums &#34;Planet Caravan&#34;, it may be quieter than the other songs, but it loses nothing in the playing.  (People often think quiet songs from a band like Sabbath aren't worth listening to, they are wrong).  It proves they have range. I have been a fan, since the beginning, have all of the discs, and have found that if one listens close; ignores the &#34;hype&#34;, about what the songs are supposed to be &#34;doom, gloom, and so on&#34; they actually have some important things to say.  The lyrics to Dear Father sound as though they could be addressing the &#34;sex abuse&#34; by priests.  I don't know if that was their intention, but it could be interpreted that way.  In any case, age has not diminished their ability to provide a powerful force in music.  I wish them best of luck on the upcoming tour; Tony best of luck in beating cancer (which unfortunately took Ronnie Dio) and with all of their lives.  When all is said and done, no one does it better.  Get this disc. YEAH!<br /><br />[I wish the songs that are on the new &#34;End&#34; tour would see the light of day on a commercially available recording; from what I've read, the cd from the tour would only be available from the tour; too bad, if one can't make one of their final dates, as it would be a fitting &#34;End&#34; to their record catalog(ue)].
B004LWZW4C|5.0|My son loves this movie! I dont mind watching it either win win. It looks great in blu ray its the xmen so its cool
B0094BB4TW|4.0|JUST  NICE TO SEE WHAT  EVERYONE IS DOING. KEEP UP WITH PICTURES  AND NEWS BACK HOME..LIKE  THE IDEAS I GET ON THERE..
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Great movie for the pre teen video game crowd!  My son loved it.  He has watched it non stop for days.
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|Very similar to a board game I used to play with my brothers when we were young. This game teaches art appreciation without feeling like school or a boring art appreciation class. Very highly recommended! Only downside is it only lets you get so far before the game wants you to buy the full version.<br />Maybe a free version with less art selections for the future?
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Flow paper is a cool app. whatever you draw it will flow. I can't explain it but it's super cool. Totally worth 99 cents!
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|A red filter is absolutely essential for all SCUBA video with the GoPro. You might think you can color correct in GoPro Cineform Studio, but you are wrong. The fact is, even with the red filter you STILL need to color correct in Cineform studio. Without the filter your video will be hopelessly blue. The only alternative to a red filter for SCUBA video is a VERY expensive lighting system to bring the correct light spectrum down with you. Four stars because this small piece of plastic is quite expensive! Nonetheless I am glad I have it. Check the link below to see some of the video I took with this filter.<br /><br /> [...]
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Is a short game but very funny they get to brush the characters teeth and other interactive things, the only thing is that after that first time it keeps on repeating the same thing over and over, but it is a great game
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It used to be better. In this case change is not always good. Too cluttered and not as easy to find what you are looking for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game my friend showed it to me and so I downloaded it and of course I ended up loving and I also love how they update it they should update it to the Bahamas so it would be subway surfers in the Bahamas that would really make the game awesome
B00821PCJS|4.0|I just started watching falling skies but I wish I had been there from the beginning. 4 episodes in and I'm hooked on the characters and story development. There are a lot of ways this plot could develop and I'm hoping they keep us guessing and don't reveal too much right away.
B00B29J0I6|2.0|It's a physics based puzzler....again. It's got a cute main character....again. Goal of getting three stars in each level...again.<br /><br />It's ok, if you can get it for free.
B00DDBNJF6|5.0|Brothers and sisters cd is a classic but the delux Verizon with the ABB live at winter land and the out takes  makes this a true collectors must have . Well worth the price!
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is awesome it turns it iPod or kindle in to a phone u can tell when people r reading my messages and typing this is the best texting app out there plus u can talk to more than one person at a time I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!u should really get it
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Excellent movie that follows the history of the &#34;massacre&#34; closely although there are some diversions from history of the event.  A must see!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Awesome show. Kevin Spacey is the best! I can't wait for season 2. I love the way you can watch the whole season at your own pace.
0307476073|5.0|I bought this book because I loved the image of the hiking boots on the cover.  It was an Amazon special, so I jumped on it.  I had just read Bill Bryson's \\"Walk in the Woods,\\" so it seemed fitting to read about the trail on the other coast.  She had me at the first paragraph.  I felt like I was living in her soul, complete with her worries, disappointments, and crazy idea that she could actually do the hike.  I was fortunate enough to meet her at a book signing in San Diego, and she is even more humble and approachable in person.  This is an important book on so many levels.  It was selected as my book club's choice this month, and I am gladly reading it again.
B0086700CM|3.0|just got boring after a while so i deleted it. i thought it was a waste of time. took up space on memory
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I very much liked the story to this book. It kept my interest through out without to much off the grid sex. I so can not wait to read the next book in this series. It has me hanging in wait!!
B003Y059EK|5.0|I remember watching this in the 80s as a Sunday Night Movie. I still love it and my daughter also enjoys it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|loved every minute of every show! Sat glued to my chair since tragedy needs all of your attention! Better watching than any HOUSEWIVES episode!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Very interesting story, good character development. Unusual format, in that most of the book is a life story being recalled by the main character, but told in third person, not first person as most 'flashbacks' seem to be. Seamless integration between past and present, no confusing jumps. Only disappointment was that it finished when it did. Can't wait to read the next book (The Wise Man's Fear) and hope the third book comes out soon!
0062255657|3.0|I'm a very big fan of Neil Gaiman's book American Gods, and his comic The Sandman, and some of his other works. The thing about the Gaiman is that I'm not in love with everything he does. Stardust, Neverwher, and Coraline didn't really work for me. The Ocean At The End Of The Lane sits in the middle somewhere.<br /><br />This novel lacks the density of American Gods or The Sandman. It feels more like a really long short story than it does a novel when you consider that Gaiman's novels tend to have a lot of layers, a lot of complexity and mystery (at least, his good ones), but it is moving, and warm. It's a pleasant, quick read.<br /><br />I loved Lettie. I loved the mythology of it all. I do wish there were more to it, but I think maybe I'll reread it again in a year or two and see if I am still curious about it.<br /><br />Gaiman's strength has always, in my opinion, been in adapting mythologies that already exist and here we get to see him create his own. This is usually where he falls flat for me. Neverwhere and Stardust are prime examples of this. In The Ocean At The End Of The Lane, Gaiman creates a beautiful mythology, but does nothing with it.<br /><br />I liked it OK. I'm torn. I wanted to love it. I wanted to be mystified and inspired. Hopefully the next one will be more layered and \\"full\\". Maybe the next one will be more provocative.<br /><br />I've heard people call this novel \\"magical realism\\" but it's clearly modern fantasy.<br /><br />It's definitely not appropriate for kids.<br /><br />It seems really personal and fun. It's dedicated to his wife and he's talked about it being connected to a memory of his from childhood so maybe it was more personal than his other works and thus loses something when read by someone who only knows his works, I can't say.<br /><br />I would suggest reading the kindle sample and deciding if you want to buy it based on that. I read the physical book  so I'm not sure what all is included in the sample, but I bet it'll give you insight. And Gaiman is always charming and interesting, so there is that.you insight. And Gaiman is always charming and interesting, so there is that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the different version of the old game of solitaire.  I really like playing the game just to see if I can beat the game each time and there are times that I don't but is fun to see how many times that I can.  I have another one and get tired of the same layout of the game so this will help to have a different setup of the old solitaire.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I was glued to my seat for every episode! Loved their portrayal of the characters however harsh the times were!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Having already read Ultramarathon Man (by Dean K), and being recommended this book I thought.. more of the same.<br />While it is similar, it's not the same, there's a good story in it, and a little preaching about running shoes being evil,etc.<br />Inspirational.<br />Makes me want to run more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is awesome<br />The best game ever ever the next place Subway Surfers should go is India and they should have a girl that you can buy this time<br />Who ever made subway surfers is the best game ever and every body should play it Now!!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like this game for I am a big fan of puzzles.  I love putting them together just to see how hard they are and how long it will take.  I sometimes put the ones that I have in the home together over and over again to see if I can do them faster.  I like this on the tablet that I have for I can really pass the time away with this game.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I thought I might add Elvis into my collection and I was pleased  to have bought this set of songs.<br />About three I knew from the radio when he was getting known, but when I heard this collection on his I have to admit, He is great.  Maybe I just wasn't ready to except his still then and hearing these changed my mind.<br /> I think you may like this one too. (JV.)
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I'd give it five stars, but I don't know yet how long the elastic band will hold out (although it is still doing fine after about two months). Very light-weight, which was a key point for me, and stylish and although I really like the elastic band and hope it lasts, I will still like the cover quite well if it doesn't because my Kindle will still be quite safe and secure even if the band gives out over time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is abosolutely awesome. It doesn't freeze and it has amazing graphics. You don't really have to pay for anything and this definitely deserves a thumbs up :-)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun to play, and it makes you us your brain! could use more sounds though, I like that it has no time limits and the graphics detail are really good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic. I am hoping to get a zebra some day (in the game) because they are my favorite animal but its a lot of diamonds which are kind of hard to get
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show, excellent writing and casting.  Cant wait for season 4. Characters are so authentic to the time period, very eye opening historical perspectives.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is probably the best game I have ever played. its fun to explore all the places and building things as you go along. buy it
B00006LFGD|4.0|Good performances throughout. Can't say anything bad if Streisand is involved. She has her own style and when coupled with other top performers, the end result is above par.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. It was challenging but that's what made it great. Wish there was more levels! Please hurry up with more levels!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|The price was great and the movie work great!! I bought other ones off of ebay and they were scratched up or didnt work for the same price. I had no problem with this movie!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get this game.<br />This game is my favorite app on the app store. I really want it on the pc.
1589944607|5.0|This is a terrific board game. If you're like me and can't get enough Battlestar Galactica this board game is a must have. It's a themed game, but a very well executed one; tense and intelligent, and will mostly be appreciated by fans of the show. I'm not saying people who have not seen the brilliant reimagined 'Galactica' won't enjoy this game, but the experience playing with non fans of the show is very different than playing with those who are. Half the fun of the board game is the role playing aspect. Knowing the story, the characters and why they have the abilities they do, as well as understanding the references and the backgrounds that saturate every aspect of the game makes for a much more immersive and social experience. It really comes down to who you play with, however the game itself is top notch quality on multiple levels. I have already ordered the first expansion.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really enjoyed the first 2 books but, was very disappointed that she has tried to stretch it to 5 books instead of 3.  She didn't develop the story enough for that.  I'm not sure I will read the other 2 when they come out.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book opens up a little known part of our American history to many of us.  Very well written with nice history lesson in the appendix.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a fun game and no it is not a bad game it is really. fun this was one of the best games I have ever played in the world
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|this is a good movie this is a great movie for pg13 i recomend it the storey is very good so please watch it
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Especially fun for kids to play with, they can follow the stars and do it themselves.  It makes it possible for someone without skills to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Incredible and fun games that both myself and my kids enjoy ...spent hours playing and I would recommend it to anyone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an absolutely amazing game.it is so addicting and fun.  However either subway surfers could temple run temple run  copied subway surfers.  The two games are very very very similar but subway surfers is better in my opinion.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've had other dual port chargers before. They have never performed as well as this one has. I have been able to charge my Note 2 while using it for GPS and taking a phone call over bluetooth and was still able to charge my girlfriends' Galaxy Nexus while she was looking up movie details. We are definitely planning to get a second charger for her truck soon.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easier to understand than 100 floors - waiting for more levels! Great game! Takes brain power and time,  but it isn't overwhelmingly confusing.
B0000542D2|5.0|The more I watch this movie over the years, the better and better it gets. There is so much humor, poignancy, intelligence, wonder. Too bad the Beatles never had an appearance on Doctor Who.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Great cd. All that I expected and more. kinda got that Sweetleaf warpigs sound. If you liked the original Sabbath you will love this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big font..I can use it with ease.  That's why I picked it. Thank you, it's exactly what I need, considering my limited vision
B00006RIO7|5.0|enjoyed the movie so wanted the soundtrack and it is great to thank you very much will be looking for more
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I can watch this movie any time. It was great finally to see some of the missing scenes. I would be interested in a director's cut with more of those scenes put back in.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Such a shame that she chose to end the series with such a horribly written book.  It's like she gave up and just wanted it over with. She made Sookie into a character that was barely even likeable and the story was so rushed to just get to the end it didn't do anything to develop how they got there.  Really sad to see it end so poorly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! Make more levels! I just finished it and no longer know what to do with my life anymore.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|loved the movie so wanted the soundtrack love it to thank you very much will be looking for more soundtracks
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a MUST get game. I LOVE it. Minecraft is on mobile devices. Take any where, build anything. Only limited by your imagination.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I never followed the old stuff about Bernie Leaden and Randy Meissner.  And the addition of Steuwart Smith.  I feel complete!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I love to play it. All my friends ask to play it when they don't have there phone or tablet. I give this app a 5 star rating.
B006GLM5EQ|1.0|no real story just a bunch of peaple running around killing each other  and that was just at the begging and it got worse from there
B0024F13NC|5.0|Dr. Feelgood is simply one of the best songs that has ever come, period. So, having said that, I would definitely recommend this album but of course tastes differ from person to person, so you might not like it - though, it would be a huge miss in this current world that is full of s***ty and meaningless music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is the perfect combination of love, scandal, and life. You can't watch Season 3 without watching 1 and 2 first. You will love life at Downton Abbey.
B00846REIS|4.0|Ok, so I hate comparing books to other books....and I hate when others do that too but when I first started this book I was hesitant to read further than the 3rd chapter. I'd read the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy and this book just sounded too much like the same love story. A young, hunky billionaire falls for a seemingly &#34;girl next door&#34; young woman who works in the same building that he works and owns. The further I read the more I liked Gideon and Eva's story. They both have issues that seem impossible to overcome together because of their jealous and possessive natures. Of course, everyone is beautiful...and all of them have some pretty screwed up issues. And I think it's for that reason that I liked this story. Even rich people are dysfunctional to the extreme.<br /><br />The cons:<br />Every other thought that Eva has is how gorgeous and sexy Gideon is. We get it! It was repetitive, A LOT!<br /><br />Everyone is gorgeous and has money, except Eva's father who seems to be about the only normal one of the lot.<br /><br />The erotica is hot, extremely hot! But even that was a little bit repetitive. I just fast forwarded some scenes because it was just a repeat of what happened 4 paragraphs before.<br /><br />The pros:<br />The story is well written and easy to follow.<br /><br />You get pulled into Eva and Gideon's story and you end up rooting for them before you know it. I wanted to read on because I so wanted them to figure out their issues and work it out together.<br /><br />Gideon is likable except when he's not and that intrigued me. At one minute he seems like a total cad but then when you learn why he does what he does, your heart melts. He has a reason for everything he does. And even though he's mega-rich, he still sucks at relationships which proves that money can't buy everything.<br /><br />Eva comes off like a star-struck teenager and it's annoying at times because it's like she never saw a good looking guy before. But then you learn why she isthe way she is and why it's hard for her to believe someone like him could like someone like her.<br /><br />All in all...I ended up buying the whole trilogy and I found that I wanted to read more about them. I know it's hard but try to put Ana and Christian from 50 Shades to the side when reading this because even though the stories seem to be the same, and some parts do feel that way, the underlying stories are very different.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I lo-lo-lo-love Sixx A.M. This was their first album, their gift to us who appreciate and long for some true, good quality music. The music that has come out of these three hugely talented men cannot be described or compared to others, so just go ahead and hear it.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|So far I have read good and bad reviews of this thing... but I wouldn't know because it keeps saying that &quot;Kindle can't install blah blah blah&quot; Someone help?
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|Of course, the book is always better and richer.  But this rendering of the Jane Austen novel faithfully hits the marks that are the most salient plot and character points in the book and does so economically and coherently.  Good acting, lush scenery, good pacing--an enjoyable outing for JA fans.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Cannot say much for Alice in Chains as they are my number 1 band for about 20 years, BUT this album is just their best of the best. I'm pretty sure they will beat this album with their next one, however I have been listening to this one non-stop since I received it. Thank God for having sent Jerry Cantrell to this world.<br />And, another thing to whoever says Layne is Alice in Chains:<br />Please, get over it; people die, we will all die - so, stop being stuck and obsessive and just try to enjoy whatever goodness you can find while you are in this world.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Luv Sylvia's books.  Waited for this one and I was not let down.  Bring on more Crossfire books.  Great job!
0143122916|5.0|A tragic story from the first to the last page. This young man suffered unrelenting pain and suffering while held captive in the North Korean camp. He was not able to develop family love or warmth. Only by a miracle was he able to escape the camp and travel to safety.
B000002NG7|5.0|Mike Patton. Period :)<br />Anyone who knows what a great musician he is knows what I mean by saying this. This was sadly their last album but luckily has timeless songs in it that I keep listening to every day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works good and flows well on the Kindle Fire HD. I use this app everyday for crafting ideas and inspiration.
B007TK77QE|4.0|It has a complexity we're used to from HP, but on a far more intimate scale.<br />Very well written as expected but felt a bit forced for me.<br /><br />A little shocked the &#34;mother&#34; of HP could swear this much, but liked it for the story.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|Another album, another different type of music from the genius named Mike Patton. If you are a rock/hard rock/metal fan and have heard Mike's name from such bands and have limited idea about him, and expect yet another album in those genres, you probably won't like this album. But, if you know what Mike Patton is, how he has no limits music-wise, you won't be surprised hearing the songs on this album. They are all too good. The world needs more Mike Pattons but unfortunately, musicians like him are getting rare and rare.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Very Recommended, I really loved it. I was expecting something different, but I really enjoyed this album. My favorite song is Contact
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a nurse this really spoke to me.<br /><br />Her struggle to be heard and understood and the sudden possibility of love is just heartbreaking.<br />I've recommended this to everyone I know. Even patients, since this proves that if we listen we will hear.<br /><br />Loved it.
B004N44SOI|5.0|What can I say?? Each man in this band is super-overly-too much-talented. James Michael, Nikki Sixx, DJ Ashba... This combination makes one hell of a band who produces some super quality true music that my ears have missed to hear. Very much looking forward to their 3rd album as well as James's solo album if he ever decides to make one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It is so challenging, great for people who like logic and mystery games. Highly recommended for people of all ages.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Grandson loved this.  I was his Christmas present this past year.  He probably has it memorized by now.  His little brother is beginning to watch them now.  It just goes on and on.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I generally always like John Grisham's books.  I've read all the Theodore Boone books, and this one ranked up near the top for entertainment.
0062014536|3.0|I have to say, I am not completely satisfied with the ending to the Delirium Trilogy. Although it contained mountains of action, and we definitely see Lena grow stronger as a result of her role in the Resistance, I was left feeling slightly disappointed with the lack of closure. I'm sure this was the author's intention... to leave the story open-ended and allow us to draw our own conclusions about what is to come: Does the Resistance win? Does the DFA regain power? Do the regulators get things under control, or is this the beginning of the end of Deliria-Free America? What happens to Hana? To Julian? What now?<br /><br />I want to know. I am anxious to find out if Alex and Lena can pick up where they left off. I am curious to see what happens next, and yet... it's over. Bummer.<br /><br />This story in and of itself was fantastic. But I feel a bit like I was thrown over the edge of a cliff, and I am waiting... suspended. Just stuck there. It seems as if there should be more to the story.<br /><br />I know Lauren Oliver has written \\"Hana\\", and perhaps there will be some answers there. I sure hope so.<br /><br />Casey Hays<br />Author of [[ASIN:0988188007 The Cadence]]
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has written another winner.  And the Mountains Echoed lives up to his previous successes.  Definitely would recommend.  Excellent read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game cant wait for mod levels please hurry. I love the games that have puzzles in them
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Good game but takes too long to load and I wish it did not require internet to play but but has cute graphics
B000002PH1|5.0|What a great album.  She is a great singer with a  great voice.  If you like Belinda you will love this album!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a truly great app. I use it in all situations. Especially to make sure that there are no tornado warnings or advisories. I also use it to check on my grand daddy who is deaf and cant hear tornados. one time he slept through an entire tornado. I greatly reccomend this app.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Paul Anka is one of my wife's favorite singers, as well as mine.  This duet CD is rather unique.  The duet with Sinatra on &#34;My Way&#34; is terrific.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughters share and giggle and just love playing this game.  They find it easy to understand  and play well.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|Love this show.  I started watching it since summer TV is a  bit dull.  I enjoy how they move from future to past dates.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|This movie sucked! My kids laughed most of the way through it. Very disappointed to see Brad Pitt in this movie.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This season changes everything for these beloved characters, yet again. Visually stunning, emotionally gripping, Downton Abbey continues to be a superior period drama of worth.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I love gossip girl but netflix only had 5 seasons. I am so glad that amazon had the 6th season because netflix did not.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This was a requested gift so it went over very well. I haven't seen the movie but I love Cher so I'd probably like it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Appreciate the works of this author....which provide a glimpse of the Afganistan people and culture.  &#34;Many Splendid Suns&#34;, &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and now &#34;The Mountains Echoed&#34; are excellent reads about  beautiful, sensitive people and the culture they are part of.  The challenges are hugh, their burdens overwhelming, but their spirit survives!  I gave this a 4 star because reading was oft interrupted by travels.  Plan to reread with uninterrupted time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is as good as ever! Did not want this end. Can not wait to read what he has next in store.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|After nearly sleeping through &#34;Star Trek - The Motion Picture&#34; it was and IS very exciting to watch &#34;Star Trek II - The Wrath of Kahn&#34;!  All of the original series characters were portrayed by the original actors in excellent form and the story and action was far more like what we all came to enjoy and appreciate in the TV series. Captain (pardon me, ADMIRAL) Kirk was his old self and so were Spock, et al. The confrontation with his old enemy Kahn (portrayed by Ricardo Montalban) was classic Star Trek and kept the viewer's interest right through to the tragic ending. Spock revealed his most &#34;human&#34; heart when he sacrificed himself for the life of his shipmates. William Shatner never was an Academy Award level of actor  (the only reason the film doesn't rate 5 stars) but he does perform quite well and delivers his best in this role. A good two popcorn bag movie which should entertain just about anybody (not only &#34;trekkies&#34;).
0307476464|3.0|With all due respect, this novel in my opinion is Murakami's worst. I have read all his novels and most of his short stories and enjoyed them greatly. This book is unnecessary bloated, repetitious and by the third part becomes quite irritating to read on. If it is the first book by him you are planning to read, do, but then read something else by him after and you will most likely enjoy his earlier works better.
B001UW58WW|5.0|David brings his sense of fun and interpretation to some classic songs. Listen to a track or 2 and you will fall in love with his style and energy. Even if you think you would never like violin music he will make you change your mind. Give it a go you will be glad you did.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Installed this APU in an MSI mobo, and am using it for an HTPC. So far, so good. Plays HD and Blu-ray great!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is excellent!!! I've watched it so many times and I'm still not tired of it! Such a great cast. Uplifting, beautiful, powerful :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. I was sad when all the levels ended. please create more levels. I was just starting to have fun!
B004ELSDZK|2.0|I feel bad not liking this game because it is well put together and it should be fun. I did not enjoy it. I will chalk it up to personal preference. I am glad I didn't pay for it. I think it was a free app of the day.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Could not put it down, read it for 9 hours on a flight. Glad I had the trilogy and enjoyed discussing it with friends!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Great stuff. I'm pretty much glued to this on my Kindle. Between that and Instapapeer the wife ain't happy, but I'm very well informed.
0062080237|5.0|I would highly recommend it! The story is very interesting and gets you hooked right from the beginning. Go order it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Was a lot of fun finding and solving the puzzles. Overall a lot of fun.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Disney movies, the old favorites, are the very best.  Great for those long vacation drives.  Children love these classic movies!
B009AMALGM|1.0|Theres no way this was a true story.its a complete act of hollywood.a Demon is not gonna keep using a physical body to intrude someones home and snapp their necks.especially the same person. or pick people up out of thin air or drag them off to who knows where.If paranormal activity was any good Id probibly own all 3 or 4 movies buy now.If your curious about this movie rent it,do not buy it,you wont want to keep it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie is awesme.  The animated movie is  creative and fun to watch. My wife enjoyed it. .<br />You gotta see this movie.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|...I am so hooked on this series.  I like the characters and the plot seems a little quirky but interesting...I will watch them all!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|What a wonderfully crafted film &#34;Quartet&#34; is. With an all star cast, exquisite music and a marvelous job of directing by Dustin Hoffman, &#34;Quartet&#34; assures us that at least some studios and directors are still making movies &#34;like they used to&#34;.<br />Maggie Smith steals the show and is absolutely wonderful.<br />Rent it! You won't be sorry.
0061474339|5.0|This author.... is one of those amazing writers i have ever had the chance to come across on. It all started with Sabriel back when I was a 7th Grader. The amazing world that he has created has stayed with me for as long as I can remember. For those of you, who have not read Sabriel or Lirael. Please, stop now and read those first. Else you will have no idea what's going on while reading Abhorsen.<br /><br />Abhorsen starts off immediately after where Lirael ended. With the help of Mogget and the Disruputable Dog Lirael embraces her new future and the uncertainties of the what, where, and how will have to be dealt with immediately before Life is consumed by Orannis. The dark humor is still fresh, but slowly dissipates as threat builds itself into a frenzy. You see and explore more of the world of Death. Things like the Wall, Bells, and even more importantly the Great Charter Lines are a bit more explored in Abhorsen then the other books. You see it's magic used in the last battle scene and everything comes together. The reasons to why. The reasons to how. Masterfully done and just every bit as amazing as the first two books. I really can't wait for Clariel: The Lost Abhorsen to hit the shelves, just so it can stand proudly next to Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen, and other amazing works like Harry Potter and J.R.R. Tolkien. Thank you Garth Nix. Thank you.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I've heard about this story and musical for some time, but it wasn't until I heard Susan Boyle's version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" that my interest was truly perked. Then, when I saw a trailer for this movie on TV, it snagged me like a fish on a hook. After reading and hearing more about it and listening to a couple of the songs for myself, I thought, \\"That's it, I'm definitely going to see this.\\" Anne Hathaway is one of my favorite actresses, so I figured I'd watch it for her sake if nothing else.<br /><br />Intrigued as I was, I still wondered how I could make it through two and a half hours of almost non-stop singing. I love musicals, but I don't have a lot of patience for lengthy movies; I get twitchy after an hour and a half. But when I finally settled down and watched this thing from start to finish, it held my interest, and when it was over, my reaction could be summed up in one word: \\"WOW!\\"<br /><br />There's nothing I can say about this movie that likely hasn't been said already, but I can tell you for myself that this is very, very well-done. I think I've become a new fan of Hugh Jackman, and even Russell Crowe wasn't half-bad. (I'll admit Crowe did appear rather stiff, but then again, he is portraying a stiff character.) Anne's version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is possibly the best version I've heard yet (my dad thinks so, too) because she's crying AND singing at the same time, and she stays convincing the whole time. Sometimes I wished I could somehow step through the screen and give her a great big hug.<br /><br />Bottom line: this movie is definitely worth watching, even if only once, even if you're not particularly fond of musicals.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was more than I expected. It puts a unique narrative twist on a popular theme, which adds up to an interesting and fun read.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|You should read this dictionary it is awesome.the way they describe the word is so long and cool.read this dictionary please.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't know anything about minecraft but I was convinced to buy it for my 6 yr old son...he loves it although I don't know how good he is at it.  I hope for $6.99 he gets lots of mileage out of it...usually I only agree to download the $0.99 games!!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Beautifully written, shot, and acted.  Couldn't ask for anything more.  Surprising this came from network TV and not cable.  Kudos.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing! I don't read very much but after the first book I was hooked. I read all 3 in a couple weeks.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I always loved Mahjong on my PC and this version for my kindle was perfect...great for distraction or when I have time to kill at an appointment or something.  I'm looking forward to playing it at the airport next week!
B002U1F32M|5.0|What more can I say.  This movie turned me around on indie romantic comedies.  Inspires me as a filmmaker to work harder and as a consumer to expect more.  Thank you to the writers and director.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game! It was challenging and made you think, but it was still fun and not too difficult. I can't wait for the new floors!! :)
B005J6LKVI|5.0|A true realistic inside look at racial attitudes and behaviors THEN and even NOW in America: \\"Where all men (and women) are created equal.\\"
B002ELIXCA|4.0|I love the Dexter series.  Of course, it's gotten a bit drawn out, but this was a great start.  Michael C. Hall is fantastic and I hope that after Dexter he will move more into feature films.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Maggie Smith et al are simply superb. Billy Connolly gets better with age. A lovely film for everyone! Must see
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|I have the collectors edition that came out about 10 years ago and it's just better on Blue Ray. The clarity in the darker scenes and the detail is greater. I haven't got around to watching the extras yet. I would recommend this blue ray DVD to a friend or any Beatles fan or movie buff.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|the game was ok. I like it because i like the type of game that it is.  It kept me enertained til the very end great time passer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good but don't like to have to leave review to keep playing<br />other than that overall happy. yep yep yep yep. okay
8866137405|3.0|The stickers that come with the planner to personalize it fall off quickly, if they stay on at all.<br />I could have just purchased a regular planner if I wanted a plain black one with no awesome Star Wars sticker on it.<br />I would recommend the moleskin planner as it is nice looking and does what it's meant to do. I would not recommend this planner in particular.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the format of writing going back and forth with the two main characters points of view.  That made it a little bit harder to read on kindle because I would have liked to go back and compare what they were thinking.  It still was a very entertaining read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best game i have ever played ,i like how you can get more diamonds when you level up and the horses look so real.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband and I have been enjoying these DVDs and can't wait until Season 4.  My husband is a sports fan and he thought he would not like this series but really has enjoyed them.  Lor
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book is hard to get started and very confusing to follow all of the characters the author introduces. Writing style is hard to get used to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love that you can create your own world but your world ends in corners. Creative and survive are your choices on how to create your world. Creative is when you can do anything with out having to fight monsters and hunt. But if you dig too deep you will dig through your world and die. In survive mode you have to hunt, battle monsters and well survive. Let yourself get creative what would you do if you were alone in the wild?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A must see!  All the twist and turns keep you wanting more and more.  Enjoy; you will not be disappointed! Lor
B009JZWO3I|4.0|The old high power lawyer show...but wait, this is a nicely done story with an interesting twist from the up and comer female with a family, and she's actually trying to be committed to family before career.  Nice work somebody.
B001SZ2Y4G|4.0|Watched it as a kid and just re watched it. Still holds up. Always been a fan of Tim Robbins.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Funny thing is that  I find myself explaining the 80's to my kids in movie more than I do human vices and moral failings.  Wreck It Ralph was fun to watch once, but I won't buy it. Half the story is completely lost to anyone who has never been to Grand Central Station or played Atari era console games.  That being said, I miss Qbert.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|This was a cool spin on the Grimm Fairy Tale. Not &#34;amazing&#34;, but a good fun watch! Like I said, just fun with decent special effects.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|If I remember right, this was one of the first extra long sci-fi flicks.  In the theatre, the cutting edge shots (at the time) were very entertaining, but rewatching this film on Prime gave me the same feeling I had for Titanic, just sink already.  It's still one of the better movies, mainly due to Will Smith's light-footed character that made it worth watching again.
B0073XORCY|5.0|great idea for an album and I love the new music, the concerts are very good to (Ive seen it 2 times). if you liked TAAB you will like this to
0156027321|3.0|How often do we say the movie is better than the book?  OK, plenty of times.  But this is not as much fun to read as it was to watch.  No fault of the author, but a splendid example of imagination to pixels for the movie.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Of the many television shows out there today this one is very &#34;cerebral&#34; as Netflix puts it. I enjoy the suspense and the mystery of solving the case, and I like that it's realistic in the sense that they don't always win every case.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I recently broke one of my Razer Deathadder's side buttons after just over a year of use. I used it pretty heavily and really wasn't disappointed or even surprised when it happened. I initially set out for a replacement, but quickly decided I may as well 'upgrade'. I was looking for something with good ergonomic thumb buttons but hopefully more than 2. As great as the naga seems, 12 buttons is a little overkill and I'm not a fan of the fat form factor. After looking for awhile I realized there really isn't much of a market between the 2 button death adder and the 12 button naga. I stumbled upon this mouse and initially the low price was a turn off (assuming it was indicative of the overall quality of the product). After looking at it more and seeing it has a form factor more or less perfectly between the 2 previously mentioned mice ( with an equally median button count). I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I was a little wary that the plastic might feel cheap, or the rubber might be peeling (as I've seen others mention), but as of now I've had no issues. The quality of the mouse has actually been very impressive. It provides multiple features that are well above its price range. The custom lighting, weight system, and ridiculously high DPI may seem kind of trivial at first, but they're all by no means cheaply done. This mouse provides all the features of my deathadder including a great set of software, and cost me less. Then the anker threw in a bunch of bonuses, wrapped them up nicely and called it a day. The next time my mouse breaks (hopefully not too soon!) I will certainly be buying another anker. Usually the word 'gaming' is associated with overpriced products for no particular reason beyond a pretty shell. I'm more than impressed by this one. I hope to see anker taking root in more peripherals and spreading this good quality at a low price into many aspects of the 'gaming' market.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|I was a hard to follow movie. It didn't keep you interested, and the whole time you were wondering 'who' was the person they were talking about as far as the 'couple' that the movie was about. Like, 'who' she was in love with, but eventually you found out. 'Eventually' you found out that he was still in love with her, however, it wasn't that involved. Then, when they kissed at the end, it was like a lil peck, nothing of what you would think would happen lol
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is one of the few (good) novels that are fun to read from the very first page (first line, in fact). Usually, thrillers tend to have a slow, boring build-up and only get exciting anywhere from 10-30% into the book. I was apprehensive about The Innocent because of this missing build-up that all good novels have. But it didn't let me down at any point. It's also my first David Baldacci novel.<br /><br />Although there was no build-up, it wasn't that exciting from the get go. The first 5 or 10% of the book had almost no dialogue. Will Robie, the protagonist doesn't speak for several chapters in the beginning. This made me feel uncomfortable and I was already getting tired of his character. But the book eventually transformed into a regular crime-thriller novel.<br /><br />Robie was an interesting character, although not extremely likable. This was understandable because of his line of work. He is a highly trained government hit man who has been taught to keep information to himself and not give stuff away readily. Therefore, he doesn't talk easily. But there was some interesting development as the novel progressed. Same can be said about the development of other characters. I thought Nikki Vance, the FBI agent was a very cool person.<br /><br />I loved the story and the writing style. The whole thing was comfortably complex and not overdone to the point of overwhelming me with information. Baldacci also did a great job of explaining everything that's happening at the moment and also conveniently going over all the information and leads the characters are using for investigation multiple times as revision (without making it sound boring, repetitive or annoying at all). It was very easy to follow the story despite the healthy complexity of it. The whole mystery unravels itself at the end pretty efficiently like a drain being unclogged all at once. Baldacci did a spectacular job of explaining tiny loose end within just a couple of pages. The whole novel had me turning page after page at the edge of my seat for long periods of time. One of the reasons was that the chapters are very short and I would binge on them thinking 'eh, one more won't hurt.' My Kindle kept telling me it would only take about 3-5 minutes to read this new chapter and I just kept going.<br /><br />This was a very close to perfect thriller novel. It has got me hooked to this author.g page after page at the edge of my seat for long periods of time.

B000OBYLVO|5.0|I love it. I hate that Kate's part of the story isn't more 'involved' like Cameron's character, but in all its a great movie! :)
B0094MFITS|4.0|I've watched all of the series and really enjoyed them.  Tom Selleck has the character down cold.  Hope he continues with the series.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|Easy to read, up to date and written in a clear, fresh style. Just what you need when out and about with the tablet
B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed the first five or six episodes when it first came on tv and am so glad to catch up!!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|As usual, Lee Child has given us a solid and dependable story, playing to Jack's strengths.  If you're a fan then A Wanted Man has everything you'd expect.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I couldn't put the story down over I started. I fell in love with the characters, the story line, and went up and down as the story went on. Jodi took more than one heard topic, IVF and same sex marriages, and made it all work out in the end. Another wonderful story by Jodi, although I don't know why I'm surprised.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel does an excellent job with this one, and the special effects are well done. However, this is not a family film, by any means.
0140067477|5.0|The Tao Of Pooh is a book full of wisdom and simple ideas that can put one life at peace.  I had to read this for a college class and it was so much more than I expected.  We all can compare our ways of living to one of the characters and learn how we can enhance our lives if we follow the lessons.  I enjoyed the book and plan on reading it again in the near future for reminders.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Awesome bang for your buck, great quad core processor, definitely suits my 7950 well.  If you are building a gaming PC, definitely give this a look.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I honestly didn't even finish reading this book. It was all the same and I didn't feel like wasting my time reading through 100 pages, hoping to get re-hooked into the story. The novel gave me the same impression I'm getting from a lot of these &#34;trilogies&#34;--it's a good story, but one that's stretched out in order to fit into three books when it could've fit into one or two. I set this down, picked up _Wallbanger_, and never looked back.
B005LJITS0|3.0|It's good as a super hero movie. It's no Avengers by any means, but it's certainly no Ghost Rider either (shudders). It's quite good, despite a few things and a bit of a cheesy romantic moment, but not worth a one star I was expecting I'd give it.
B0094K1K42|3.0|I was confused on the concept of this movie, it was a little sad for me.  I thought I was going to watch a comedy but that's justmy own mistake.  Other than the surprise of the genre it was an okay movie for me.

B0090KZDSK|5.0|I loved this 3rd book in the Crossfire Series. I read it within 24 hours of downloading it onto my kindle. Sometimes you just need to brain fade out of the system and this book took me to nowhere in particular... but i wasn't washing, cleaning or doing anything 'housewifey'  Yes, it is similar to all the other books, but sometimes a good novel about somebody else's life is just plain better than your life. If you enjoyed books 1 & 2 then this answers some of this unanswered from previous books.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|I know an author has to lay out a history of the main people to make a series.  Just feel it could have been better written.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Ignore all the negative reviews out there.  I thought this movie was funny, adorable and very entertaining.  The two main characters have great chemisty and the story line is great.  The main zombie character, 'R', has the best inner dialogue.  I considered it a great rom-com.  My husband even enjoyed it!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|If the first books were like this one, there would be no tv series.  It appeared as if he had to fulfill a contract with another series book.  Filled with great nothings and to add just additional lines he inserted more sex related items than he had in all the four previous books.  You can see why it took him so long to write the last book,  He did not know how to end the series  so he just left everything hanging.  I read the early reviews and should have taken their reviews and not spend my money.  The author could have done much better.
075669812X|3.0|I bought this book for my 8 year old who went on and on about how much he wanted this book not realizing that he really just wanted the green Ninja Lego figure that comes with the book.  Green Ninja sits coveted on his dresser while the Character Encyclopedia lies abandoned at the bottom of his toy chest... Didn't even make it to the book shelf.

B0064MGU98|5.0|what a great series!  i was looking for a new series to occupy my nights and had read great views on metacritic.com.  i surely haven't been disappointed.  the storyline is engaging, and Julianna Margulies and the supporting cast are well-developed, FANTASTIC characters.  i also enjoy learning the intricacies of the legal system.  plus as a bonus, all of the first 3 seasons are available for free streaming to Amazon Prime customers!  very cool.  check it out!!
B00947N6UG|4.0|This was a surprisingly good movie.  We had little expectations in way of it being entertaining but we enjoyed it as much as the kids.  Only thing for parents to be aware of, the Boogy Man is kind of creepy, not good for sensitive kids with active imaginations.  My six year old son barely tolerated him, had to hide his face at times.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Marilyn Manson is by far one of my idols of all time. He just does what he wants and never apologizes, how would you feel if the demon of your childhood has a face, a family, fears, likes, and guilt. Marilyn Manson takes you on his journey into becoming the Antichrist Superstar.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I loved playing this game. It was fun, and kept my interest. I like most of the g5 games because they go beyond what other hidden object  games lack in creativity and interaction. I definitely would recommend this  game to those who likes mysteries, and finding hidden objects.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|I've never seen a free game of this caliber. And by free I mean FREE. No excuses. I Mean you can buy in game content and currency but you don't need to to get far in the game. Though I would like it if they saved your progress if you delete the game which happened in my case but I'm not complaining cause I'll play the whole game over. Two thumbs up and seriously consider getting this game if you like hack and slash dungeon kind of games.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie but I was surprised.  Yes there were cheesy moments but overall the movie kept my attention and that was what I considered important.  Worth watching.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very good graphics and unlimited upgrades to keep u going for more. It is a very large file but who doesn't like Iron Man. Try it out you will love it.
B00C8985DU|4.0|Great item! lots of neat stuff included w/this deluxe edition. The only complaint I have w/this and some other shipments from Amazon is the packaging and/or sometimes the product itself is damaged a little upon arrival. This has not been too big of a deal, but something I believe leaves room for improvement.
B00008CMR6|5.0|John Wayne at his best.  A brilliant retelling of a great story performed by a man I believe was the greatest film actor of all time.  He is always consistent, always believable and yes you can also say always the same, but the character created by John Ford is endearing, lovable, majestic, regal and royal.  The Duke is the man
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I loved the movie and figured I would also enjoy the book. I was very wrong. The book is flat, the characters unlikable and undeveloped, and the story goes absolutely nowhere. Many reviewers missed the fact that the protagonist, Pat, has a traumatic brain injury in the book, whereas in the movie he only has bipolar disorder. This  is the reason for the &quot;childlike&quot; voice of the book. Still, the fact that this piece of information was missed by the majority of readers is a reflection on the poor quality of the writing, not the readers.<br /><br />Go see the movie. The cast is wonderful and they make you care in a way the book does not.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I wanted to get Toy Story for my son for his birthday but it was $30 at all the big box stores.  Saw this on Amazon, getting all three for $35 and it was a no brainer.  Great deal!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The first two books were bearable but this one is just a plain insult to women's intelligence. I also don't consider myself a prude but the authors use of certain words are unnecessary. Almost half way through and not sure I can even finish it - it's torture
B006S009IY|4.0|This movie is based on J.M. Barrie and how he was inspired to write \\"Peter Pan\\". A family movie in which the story may be for kids older that 10 but managed to keep my children under 5 watching without complaint.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this bag for my Nikon D3100 DSLR Camera and my iPad2. Trying to keep on a budget I came across this Amazon Basics backpack. I expected it to be a sub-par pack but was proven wrong.<br /><br />This is a great backpack. It is well made, had plenty of storage for 1 or 2 dslr cameras and lenses ( I pack light so it's more than enough space inside for what I use it for).<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone that wants a reliable backpack style camera bag. It'll keep your equipment safe and look good on you too!

B00005QW5X|4.0|I love this movie and would love to give this transaction 5 stars, BUT the packaging of the actual item is considerably different than what is indicated here. No &#34;Newline Platinum Series&#34; banner, different front & back artwork layout, and on top of that even a cut through the barcode and into the plastic case. The Special Features all appear to be here, but the difference prompted me to spend time searching to make sure that what I got was the real deal. If what I got is a reissue (as appears to be the case from the 2011 copyright), I'm baffled why the seller wouldn't use the new artwork.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Exactly as described and works without flaw I like it ! I have dropped this case several times with the kindle inside , no damage to either. Wish it had more positive locking system when standing in upright position.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The graphics are better than other games. I thing it is a lot easier to swipe than tilt. I like the different countries.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a good addition to my kindle.  I will use it a lot when I just can't figure it out in my head.
B00CLZ48FA|3.0|Mildly entertaining, but really dull acting.  James Franco seems to get cast in roles that just don't seem right for him.
B00000I8BX|5.0|All songs on this CD are definitely worth listening to.  It's a CD I love to drive around in my car and use my imagination to the music.  It's ultra badass!

B00BGIC170|1.0|Was not what I expected the movie to be. It is really a slow and boring movie. characters did not seem authentic and I wanted to shut off the movie the first 30 min into it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was initially not in agreement with what I had heard on Sheryl's ted talk.  But this book is really good and important.  It has given me a completely different perspective on Norwich more our society needs to do to enable both men and women lean in to their life's passions.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|The love story continues and I was equally addicted to the second book in this series!!! Can't wait to start the next book!
0792156684|4.0|Not the best acted movie by some of the cast, but where it's lacking there it's made up by other cast members and a good story line.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is equally as addicting as the other two!!! If you don't like a cliffhangers, this is not the book for you. I was suprised that it cut off so bluntly. I can't wait til the next book!!!!
B00CAKDF28|4.0|This is the movie  you can watch over and over and always enjoy!!  A solid cast who seemed to be having a good time as well.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to just sit back and enjoy life.  No hidden agendas, no message you have to learn, just a fun movie!
B008OM0EDO|3.0|funny, but very crude.  don't expect great acting from this, but you will have a pretty good laugh over it

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Superman is one of the most iconic and well known characters not only in comics, but in entertainment history. Superman was the ideal that brought the modern day superheroes to life, and through the combination of revolutionary action comics and successful films (at least earlier on), Superman rose to become the best of superheros. However, after his second big screen adaptation, Superman lost his throne as king of comic books. His drop in quality in comic books and films made a lot of people lose respect and love for the character, and the original Superman film was dethroned by \\"The Dark Knight\\" and \\"The Avengers\\" to many people as the greatest comic book movie of all time.<br /><br />This summer, director Zack Snyder (Watchmen, 300), producer Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception), and screenwriter David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, Blade) are here to attempt to change this, with Man of Steel. Man of Steel promises to be a more realistic take on the character, promising to finally make the character of Superman relatable, while delivering a Nolan-esque story, and promising to deliver on the epic action sequences after the lack of them in the latest Superman film, Superman Returns. Being hyped up as one of the most anticipated films of the year, can Man of Steel live up to the hype, or will this be the final piece of Kryptonite for the Superman film franchise?<br /><br />Man of Steel is the retelling of the Superman origin story. For those of you who aren't aware of the origin story, the film involves a planet far away called Krypton. At the start of the film, a baby is born on this planet, and shortly after, we learn that the planet is doomed, and that its core is collapsing on itself. So the parents of this baby, the father being Jor-El (played by Russel Crowe), are forced to send the baby to Earth to guarantee the survival of it and Krypton's citizens. Along with this, you also are introduced to the main protagonist, General Zod (played by Michael Shannon), as well as some other elements to the plot which I will not give away here.<br /><br />Once we reach Earth, the film jumps right into the main plot of the film, which juggles flashbacks to Clark Kent's childhood which run parallel to the events and character development in the main plot. The main plot involves the Superman origin story that we know: Clark Kent growing up being a bit of an outsider to most people, finding the Fortress of Solitude (which is much different in Man of Steel than in the previous films), and becoming Superman. However, shortly after finally donning the cape, General Zod invades Earth, threatening the existence of man kind. From there, it is up to Superman to stop him.<br /><br />I know, I know, a lot of people are most likely sick of superhero origin stories, especially reboots. However, to those who cry foul at these origin stories, you can be rest assured that Man of Steel's approach is the freshest and most exciting yet seen in recent comic book movies. Man of Steel includes the origin story of Superman, but this is NOT the same one that we saw in Richard Donner's film. Many new themes are explored, characters are given more of an amount of depth than in the previous films, and the storytelling, thankfully, doesn't focus on events we have had beaten into our heads before. For example, in the original Superman movie, the film went straight from a couple of scenes in Smallville straight to the Fortress of Solitude where he becomes Superman, but Man of Steel does a good job at exploring the character of Clark Kent before that.<br /><br />We learn more about how Clark Kent was an outsider, how he had to struggle with being human when he really wasn't (might I add, in a realistic way), and we also get to see a bit more of what happens to Clark between his voyage from Smallville and him finding the Fortress of Solitude. So, in this respect, even though it tells an origin story again, Man of Steel's storytelling does not feel at all like the previous films. In fact, thanks to Goyer's persistence at slowly feeding information about Clark's past to the audience throughout the film (even to the very last scene), Man of Steel's storytelling is interesting, fresh, and exciting.<br /><br />One of the biggest complains people have about the character of Superman is that he isn't relatable. Well, thanks to a clever script and a story centered much more around the development of Clark Kent, Man of Steel fixes this. This take on Superman shows Superman as much more vulnerable, and much more of a \\"man\\" in the title of \\"Superman\\" than the previous incarnations. Goyer's attempts at making a more relatable and modern Superman really work. While this Superman still stands for justice and is selfless, he is also human, feels pain, and is, ultimately, a man inside of an alien body. The film does an excellent job at displaying this, making the audience feel far more connected to its hero than in previous Superman films.<br /><br />In addition to making Superman more relatable, the main villain, General Zod, has been given a surprising amount of depth in the film. People say that great drama comes from opposing ideas of right and wrong, and Man of Steel really embodies this with General Zod. General Zod certainly is menacing and villanous, but some of his actions are also justified. He is a villain who is a bit misunderstood, who has good intentions in regards to his own people, but someone who uses violent methods, and is ultimately holding onto a world that is helplessly gone forever. It is great stuff, and a fantastic reimagining of the classic villain.<br /><br />What has also been further explored in Man of Steel is the father son relationship. I wish I could talk more about it, but suffice to say, both Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, Superman's human father, are both further explored and freshened out in the film, and the scenes with them and Clark really make for an emotionally captivating and moving experience.I never thought these characters would be fleshened out, or given the amount of screen time, that they were, but I am certainly glad that they were.<br /><br />There are other elements to the plot, such as some sci fi elements that relate to the comics, the story of Lois Lane and Superman growing as a couple, the film treating Superman's arrival as sort of a \\"first contact\\" type scenario (which is brilliantly executed by the way), and some other plot points that I can't really further talk about here, but suffice to say, despite the number of things that it has to juggle at times, the story is simple enough, but deep enough, that it is all satisfying. Man of Steel's story is extremely ambitious, and fortunately, it does a fantastic job at delivering.<br /><br />Delivering as many thrills as the story is the ensemble. To start, Henry Cavill is a fantastic Superman, and is without a doubt the best one we have seen since Christopher Reeves. Henry Cavill is humble, selfless, and heroic as Superman, but also bringing out the pain in his character, as well as his human side, far more than many interpretations of the character. When we see what he has to sacrifice, the choices he has to make for the better of people, and see him grow as a charater is so satisfying thanks to Cavill's performance. Additionally, he REALLY looks the part, and he sounds exactly like you would imagine Superman sounding like.<br /><br />Just as fantastic, although not sharing as much screen time, are the two fatherly figures: Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russel Crowe as Jor-El. Jonathan Kent is far more concerned about Clark Kent revealing who he really is to the world, but he still loves him like a son, and Kevin Costner does a brilliant job at displaying that. There are some truly emotionally moving scene between him and Clark throughout the film that really make us connect to both characters, and Kevin Costner's performance  sells every single minute. In a similar sense, Russel Crowe does a fantastic job at playing a father who, ironically, wants his son to explore who he really is, and to help other people with it, and these sort of opposing ideas really play out in interesting ways, and in ways that aren't so black and white, and it is quite refreshing.<br /><br />Michael Shannon does a great job as General Zod for the interpretation of the character that we are given. While I wish he was slightly more menacing, I still very much appreciated his performance, and I felt that he was a very good villain for Superman to go up against. On the other hand, I found Amy Adams to be the best Lois Lane in the history of the Superman franchise, thanks to her charm and her display of feminist qualities that make her far more than another damsal in distress. Additionally, her relationship with Superman felt much more natural than it does in other comic book films. While they didn't explore the relationship as much as some people would want, there is definitely room for growth in future sequels.<br /><br />Additionally, the rest of the supporting cast, including Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and some extremely talented kids playing young versions of Clark Kent (seriously I normally hate kid actors, but they were great in Man of Steel), the acting across the board is fantastic.<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints of past Superman films is that the action is seriously lacking, and Superman simply doesn't kick enough butt. Well, to everyone who had previously complained about that, your prayers have been answered with Man of Steel. The action sequences in this film are big in scale, epic, and powerful. Superman throws more than just a couple of punches, and buildings and city blocks are knocked over and destroyed like legos with a little kid. These fight sequences feel as if they were ripped straight out of Superman comic books, and they are awesome. They really display how powerful Superman is, how deadly a fight with him canbe, and the modern wonders of CGI that can be used to show off a powerful superhero.<br /><br />All of these scenes, both the amazing action sequences (including the best final fight I have seen in a superhero movie) and the quieter, more tender moments in the film, are complimented with an amazing original score by Hans Zimmer. While nothing can top the original Superman theme by John Williams, the score here by Hans Zimmer is truly amazing, and compliments the film brilliantly. It also isn't as heavy on drums as some of his previous scores, and there are some more memorable themes to be found here, which is great.<br /><br />While there are so many things in Man of Steel that delivered, there are some minor flaws that are worth pointing out. First of all, as stunning and incredible as the action scenes are at times, I found that they were a little exhausting towards the end. Again, the quality of the action scenes were amazing, but I felt as if they could have cut out a little bit of it in the end. Additionally, there is a point in the plot between where Clark leaves  Smallville and finds the Fortress of Solitude where he is job hopping while also saving people and developing as person. The scenes we are given here are amazing, but I wish we had more of them. There were maybe only two or three of these scenes throughout the film, and I thin that the film would have benefited a bit more from just a few more.<br /><br />However, these flaws, while significant, are more forgivable withe everything the film does right, as well as one thing that really makes Man of Steel a truly ballsy and incredible reboot: the ending. I won't spoil exactly what happens, but I will say that my reaction to it could be described only in one word: wow. It was incredible in my mind, and really did an amazing job at bringing closure to the story, exploring parts of Superman that hadn't been explored before, and also somehow bringing the lore back to familiar, yet fresh territory. It was amazing, and I couldn't think of a better way to end the film.<br /><br />All in all, while Man of Steel has minor flaws holding it back from perfection, it undoubtedly delivers on all fronts. Its fresh and exciting storytelling, stellar cast, beautiful action sequences, and fantastic new direction make Man of Steel one of the best movies of the year so far. The fantastic direction of this franchise makes Superman relatable and awesome again, and seeing one of the greatest comic book characters of all time in that stage again is truly remarkable. The amazing thing too is, while the film does leave open for the future, and the audience does want more, the film ultimately wraps up in incredible fashion, also leaving me entirely fulfilled and satisfied.<br /><br />Combine all of these elements, and you have a film that truly is, well, super. It is one of the best comic book movies of all time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow this such an awesome game I love it. I can't get away from it!!!!! I can't believe how awesome it is it makes me want to scream it's so fun. Each level is a little more difficult which makes more fun and exciting!!!!! Oh yeah download it instantly!!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|LOVE this flim!  Such a unique and original story.  If you are an Alien or Sci-Fi buff -- this is a must see!

0765325950|4.0|Sanderson has had a tough job, wrapping up the stultifying and resolution-less Jordan who got lost somewhere around \\"The Path of Daggers\\" and forgot he was supposed to be telling a story instead of giving us a detailed socio-geographic description of his nameless \\"Randland\\".<br /><br />Despite the 900 pages, it probably should have taken two books to really finish the Wheel of Time series.  To his sincere credit, Sanderson made a valiant effort to tie up the dozens of loose ends via the hundreds of characters that Jordan created.  (I'm convinced even he hadn't kept them all straight.)  And he called them all back from Padan Fain to the Tinkers to all the Foresaken to ...  For a while, this reminded me of some of the mammoth comic graphic novels like \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" where having to find a way to reintroduce so many characters (\\"Look, there's Olver again.\\") was detracting and distracting.  It was a 180 from Jordan, who would start a conversation, give you two pages describing their clothing, furniture, architecture, and meanings behind every twitch before the next character spoke.  Maybe only about a 120 was needed.<br /><br />Eventually things got rolling on four battle fronts with every group ever mentioned involved in the fighting.  To extend things, there were several instances of \\"Huh?\\" including introducing the Sharans (Surprise!) in detail when they'd barely been mentioned before.  Each group had to top the other with another surprise (\\"I see your male Aiel darkfriend channelers and raise you dragons firing through gateways from an underground cavern with no entrance.\\")  People are suddenly finding new weaves of all sorts.  The massive, 200-page \\"The Last Battle\\" chapter had me flipping pages, but even toward its end I was wearying.  The Horn of Valere made an overdue appearance, followed by a badly forced \\"loss\\" before it eventually turned the tide of battle.  Rand's own battle with the Dark One was pretty dull, but Sanderson had clearly boned up on military strategy to keep the action going for as long as it did and grippingly.  (P.S. The Field of Merrilor isn't a field.)<br />The ending was a letdown.  Considering that EVERYONE had been involved, it would have been appropriate to see what happened after the last battle.  Particularly since like 90% of the Randlanders should have been dead by the end, infrastructure destroyed, and numerous groups diverse allied only to face the Dark One likely falling back into old ways.<br /><br />I think Jordan fans will like it and appreciate what Sanderson did with an epic for whom a clean and complete ending was impossible.
0525478817|1.0|First let me say that I NEVER EVER skip to the end....I disliked this book so much that I did. I found this to be boring and unrealistic of teenagers. I won't say too much because I don't want to ruin it for others. But I honestly couldn't care less about what happened to these kids. Dont waste your time if you find you don't like it....it doesn't get any better so don't keep reading hoping it will. Blah what a waste.
1781162646|5.0|He rarely lets his fans down, and this was another good read.  Not as scarey as some, but still a good, entertaining read.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After waiting so long for the third installment and expecting a conclusion to this love saga,  Sylvia Day’s latest book in the Crossfire series was disappointing -- it lacked a credible story line, the magnetism between Gideon and Eva was banal (sacrificed for the sake of supporting a fourth book) and the ending was anticlimactic (to say the least).  Furthermore, disappointed to find that the publisher and  author would dangle the latest installment as a “carrot” for eager fans in order to squeeze out at least one more book. I’m disenchanted with the series – I will not be purchasing the next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season is not a disappointment from the first episode to the last.  Can't wait for Season 4 in 2014.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham always has interesting turns in his plots. His view  of the prison system and the witness protection program (as reflected in the story) made the read worthwhile all by itself
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|Simple and thought provoking. This books shows you that you are responsible for your own life, and that thinking it makes it so.
B002R88G5E|4.0|This is an outstanding piece of writing, bringing a lifetime of intimate knowledge of the reality of the situation to an important story. We need to know these things but they can be difficult to bear. It is amazing to realise that people live under such conditions in the world we safely inhabit a distance away. This story is shocking in its brutality and is not a pleasant read but is important in its content. As a &#34;read&#34;, I did not enjoy it as much as &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34;, which was less confronting, but it's a book I feel every woman enjoying a life of freedom in a western country should read and take to heart and every man believing in freedom and  respect for individuals should acknowledge. Khaled Hosseini shines a light on the atrocities in his country for the world to see.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Got this for grand kids but they played it for only a short period of time before getting bored with it.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This extraordinary novel, on the surface, a story of ordinary people, is a most powerful portrayal of the shades of grey in life decisions. The morality of it is shocking in its complexity although the situation is, on the surface of things, relatively straight forward. The story is powerfully written from different points of view, which place the starkness of the moral dilemmas in every context. An excellent book, easy to read and full of emotional intensity.
B00B886412|5.0|very fast ,no problems,since, there is no need for sixteen words telling you how great this dvd is .Its a dvd, either you like the band or you don't.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie was awesome.  Action packed. Jamie fox did an awesome job.  Saw it at the movies and could not wait for the DVD to come out so I could add to my favorite movie collections  Loved the music also
B009KKLQKO|1.0|...so I write a review about a product I didn't watch and I'm not going to look at.<br />I visited the Boys on their tour through Germany and was really impressed and touched to see and hear them again after manny many years. The magic was still there, they are so unique. And this is what I would like to feel again while I watch a recorded documentary of them bringing joy to the people all over the world. They did<br />a fantastic performance, they were so well prepared after a long time of not playing together, even of not seeing each other. And that is what made us feel so  warm that night !!! I keep that memory in my mind and in my heart and won't let it be destroyed by a \\"quick money maker product\\". I prefer one made with love.....as the concert was !<br /><br />Joachim
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well developed characters, fast paced and surprising. Very thought provoking. Interesting exploration of  the age old question of nature vs nurture.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Even though this isn't the most compelling and spellbinding of DeMIlles books it's a great read. It was hard to put it down and filled with a few twists that will take even the most astute reader by surprise.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great writing delivered by a talented cast.  Few shows make me laugh like this one but almost all seem to be produced by Chuck Lorre.  Great thing about watching them online is that you can pause the end to read the vanity card at the end!
0140067477|4.0|The Tao of Pooh is an excellent read and, though it seems simplistic at times in terms of language and level of explanation, is able to effectively communicate one of the core messages of Taoism by the writing style alone: simplicity. The basics. The essentials.<br /><br />The story of how I came across this book alone is worthy of mention. Years ago, I had printed out online articles about bodybuilding, had read them and had stored them away. After graduating from college last month, I felt the need of going through my old stuff back home to clean the place out when I came upon the articles. One of the articles, called “The Recovery Battlefield” made mention of stress and life views and referenced this book, The Tao of Pooh, as something to read on the subject of life management. Though I used to read a few pages of the Tao te Ching daily when younger, I decided to give this book a whirl thanks to the suggestion of a bodybuilding article! I thoroughly enjoyed it and many of the messages still struck me as timelessly true: the busy bee, inner nature, seeing and accepting things as they are, and so forth. The author writes about these concepts in a way that is understandable and, at the same time, very thoughtful.<br /><br />As a kid watching Winnie the Pooh and reading the books, I really had no idea that the show and books touched on such deep life lessons. Though I feel the actual connection with Taoism is open to interpretation, the main concepts relating to Taoism and to Pooh touch on many of the same chords.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the book is its negative portrayal of other thought systems. Though one of Taoism’s main points (according to the author, even) is to accept things for how they are, Benjamin Hoff is very critical of such bodies of thought as “the thinker” and “the calculator.” There are faults to every type of person… that is what makes us human. Being a little more open-minded and accepting would have made the author and this book a 5-star read.
B00BRH2MN8|3.0|This is an impressive debut from someone so young; nothing special, but still impressive. Standout track is Royals, The Love Club
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another beautifully written novel involving Afghanistan. Such a touching story. Loved the 'Kite Runner, 'A 1000 Splendid Suns' as well!
B001EBYMB2|5.0|One of my favorite movie that accurtely depic's USMC boot camp. As a Marine myself this movie will always have a place in my personal library.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|And what I mean by that is, it's one of those books that you refer to when something is off-key in your day, or your life for that matter, and you need 'just that little bit' of clarity.  You open that puppy up and WHAM!...there's your answer!!!  I'm not a bible reader but this is probably the closest thing, (besides The Secret), that I have found to help keep me on track at being the best I can be, every single day!!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE my life and it's books like these that help me maintain my ZEST FOR LIFE!!!!  The trick is not only to read this book, the trick is to CHOOSE to live by the agreements in this book.  Such common sense stuff...most people over-think life, and make it way too complicated to live.  Don't you all get it yet?  It's US who creates our results in life by our EVERY positive AND negative thought!!  I wouldn't have such a magnificent life if I didn't know how to participate in it!!  Keep good thoughts in your head all the time, and watch the magic happen all around you!!  It's THAT easy!!  And, no, I didn't have a charmed life growing up by any means!  I had hit rock bottom before I learned how to change my life!!  You can do it too!!!
B002SRQ214|5.0|for the price you can over clock this bad boy to 4.0+ghz no problem. I did 4.0 just by raising the multiplier and the voltage by a little bit but it can definitely do more. ditch the stock cooler as it is loud and cools like crap compare to the newer stock fans from newer AMD processors. Then you can over clock it and works great with older mother boards and stuff. But if you are building from fresh get a newer processor since they are more powerful and probably more power saving too
1616550414|5.0|I won't explain how awesome this book is, you can find details from others buyers about that, but it contains a lot of things that will catch your attention. It first speaks a lot over Skyward Sword, but then you can find a lot of pictures, explanations and essays of drawings. The different chapters are really full of illustrations and the book itself is of high quality for its fair price. You don't have to read the book from the first page to the last, you can just open it and read what appears in front of you (if it's not the Time Scale).
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This is a wonderful show about the ins and outs of on stage productions. The cast of actors is unparalled
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved this game!!! You have an entire room to explore.  Finding all the clues to be able to escape to the next floor was challenging.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was actually surprised that there were some levels that gave me a decent challenge. For a free game, it's very worthwhile.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|A very fresh and original story that carries the tones and themes of classic British literature. A haunting storing that will keep you guessing until the end. I couldn't stop reading it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great, easy to use, simple app. It's very helpful for church and everyday Bible use. It's a traveling Bible, so you have it wherever you go.<br />I love how it gives you reminders every once in a while;<br />' 5 minutes a day reading the Bible can make a big difference. Want to try it now! ' But it gives you an option.<br />So yeah, just get this app.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|My best friend love love this movies and she told me to buy it because I would like it and she was right I loved it
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|.. This is the first film that I have seen take on a complete 'role' reversal, as to the corruption that coexists in the medicinal field. Patients are just as privy, if not more so, to manipulate, blackmail and ruin an upstanding physician's life and career, for their personal gain. Having said that, as is evident in this movie, there are still those MDs that continue to follow in the devil's footsteps for the love of money. To summarize, I was glad to see the portrayal of patient malice and exposing the deviant ways they employ to obtain monetary \\"benefit\\" (i.e. greed). This movie will shed light onto those who've always stood by the wolf in sheep's clothing.

B0012GTZC0|4.0|I first read follett's first 2 books in the century trilogy and fell in love with his writing. Since then I've read several others and I've liked them all. He has a talent for weaving his stories together with history, mystery, love and loss and it is this that makes his books, this included awesome. I still like the century trilogy best but this too is well worth the time.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Well written books with a lot of action.  Some language and violence, but the violence is to be expected.  I don't think the foul language is really needed, but it seems to make writers feel better to add that.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have never liked sleeping with any sound, music etc. but since trying this app I have found the perfect sounds combination to lull me to sleep. I never sleep without it now. I started with the free edition and loved it. I was perfectly satisfied with it and then the pay version was offered for the free app of the day so I upgraded. I have not tried the extra features yet because I prefer not to use headphones but will try<br />them eventually. I tried a couple of other sound apps like this one and they did not even compare. This was the best by far and I love the simple layout that is so easy to use.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|The product came in good packaging, easy to install and came with additional parts to support stand mounts as well, very good product and very good price.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|Really like the app. It works great on my tablet. It is a little slow but I think it's my tablet.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I own several of these.  I keep them in handy locations where I will need one.  Great for bug out bags, camps and so on.  It's not the choice diamond sharpener for me but it will do when there is nothing else.  I have been able to put a good edge on pocket knives and knives up to 6&#34; long.  I also use this device to sharpen all of my serrated edge knives too.  Does a great job.  Get one.

B001HQZJPM|2.0|I ordered this trilogy because I just love the movies. When I received it I knew I was going to watch all three back to back. Only to find out I was missing the first. I received The Mummy Returns (Collector's Edition), The Mummy Returns (Deluxe Edition) and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Deluxe Edition). I was missing The Mummy (Deluxe Edition) I don't' know if there was some sort of mix up or not. I was pretty bummed about that. The condition of the movies wasn't bad at all just a little wear and tear. I was just disappointed I didn't get what was advertised on the website nor the box set itself.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I can hardly believe that this app only sells for $2. This is the one that my Kindle should have come with. It is full featured and very configurable. Beautiful graphic to boot. They got the small things right.

B000FCK65W|5.0|This is a book I remember reading when I was young. I was impressed then. I was even more impressed this time.<br />It gives such a clear picture of Brooklyn in the early 1900's - the tenement housing, the ethnic diversity of the immigrants, a country on the verge of joining a world war - all through the eyes of an 11 year-old girl who grows to womanhood in the midst of it all.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Such a clever, perfect society, yet with so many flaws. This is great way to realize that we need all the simple joys in life. Everyone should read this book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Enjoyed reading this one. Loved a book from the guys perspective for a change. The main character was sexy and charming
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games like this. At first I was upset about the game not having any clues but it was rather easy to figure it out, on some levels. Please hurry and make new levels!!!!!!!!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Great idea and great campaign, just not a good match making system. Bit simplistic field of battle like yugio. Do the campaign.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome. It has great graphics and this game is for any gamer who loves action and excitement. I hope you get this game and it is totally worth it and it is at a low price. Hope u guys liked my report!

B00AAX68HG|5.0|Its a great family game. And i absolutely am in love with it. It is a very cute game. But they look more like jello than pudding.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Great book, typical Hosseini. Touching, smart and deeply tragic. Nothing would steal your breath. No cheap drama, any unexpected turns and twists. It gives you perspective though, where things starts and how it all ends. Many so different lives combined by the same pattern. Like life itself
1433502410|5.0|I love this Bible for it's information.  As a person who is studying the Bible I have another study resource and this just brings it all in better perspective.<br /><br />CON: the only thing that I have to say is the print is so very small.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this version of Sherlock Holmes.  You saved my life with Amazon streaming -- the DVD I rented turned out to be scratched, and we were missing the last 10 minutes of the final episode.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I didn't think the animation and effects were that bad; they were trying to create a world somewhat similar to the original Wizard of Oz. But the human characters - that's a different story. A waste of talent. Bad writing too.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Interesting story. Captivating characters.  A subject I knew nothing about before reading the book.  A sad commentary on child labor.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|great worked well and nice length.  has help button and clear images interesting story but store was similar to other games
1781162646|5.0|I loved this new book by Stephen King. I don't like a lot of his new stuff, but enjoy this type of book. He keeps you guessing and the plot was  believable. I also enjoyed the &#34;carnie&#34; angle and the way the story was told. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good, quick mystery with a little of everything in it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Considering the budget the video is pretty damn good, it won best documentary. But the story is probably the best that will ever be told. You wonder how it could have ever happened. Even the main characters don't understand it! Definitely a must see and I have no idea how anyone could not love it!
B0015AARJI|4.0|excellent item
B00B2V66VS|3.0|If you are someone who likes simple games this might not be for you. It's a little bit harder in my opinion. But it's still a pretty good game.
B001HBYH9Q|4.0|Saw *Notting Hill* recently.  I am usually lukewarm on Julia Roberts, but she is very good here.  If the movie can be said to be 'saved,' she is the saviour of this thing.  Two problems with the movie: 1) too much sugar, generally, and 2) Hugh Grant.  His infinitely diffident schtick works pretty well in the early going, as she is the grand celebrity and he is the man on the street; however as soon as he makes an overtly sexual move, and certainly after the initial sex, he needs to change gears--get to something more basic in his maleness--and he doesn't. This does not mean a radical transformation, he can still be sensitive, empathetic, etc., but we really need a new tonality at that point, and he doesn't provide it. That seems to me the biggest problem with the film, makes it seem just \\"a movie,\\" something inherently unreal, rather than a window into a potential real world.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it makes me feel like I have a real horse and what it would be like to take care of a horse
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Boring. Couldn't wait to finish it. The first two books were better.  He should have told much more about the next generation and also filled us in about the 3 characters from the first two books. JB
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love that I can instantly download these episodes to my Kindle and watch them whenever instead of having to wait to rent them or buy them, very good quality.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this alarm clock.  I am blind as a bat without my glasses and can see the numbers easily without them.  It does what it is supposed to do.  Easy to set; easy to use.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have not had any issues using this calculator app.<br />I like the way you can see the last figure entered in case I forgot where I left off.<br />I actually like the size of the calculator. It works well with my vision.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Demi can belt out some great songs and she can really hit those high notes. She has improved in her singing ability over the years.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|love the game of mahjong this is great and keeps my brain going Would recommend this game to everyone who loves mahjong
B00CWY76CC|4.0|LOVE this game you have Lot's of stuff to explore :) better than 100 floors...but only 10 levels right now:( I have no more new levels. plz add A LOT more levels:) fun!! I'll change star rating to 5 for sure when You add more levels..
0140557741|5.0|If you have children or work with children, they will love this book.  It's a great attention step for teaching, or just opening discussions.
B00005O3VD|5.0|This movie just proves what a once in a lifetime talent Barbra Streisand is!  It will be a long time before a talent that matches her is seen again.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have to believe that most of what Dr. Davis says is truthful here and not just another fad or made up explanation on why we're unhealthy.  It's informative and I personally have benefited from living wheat free since I read the book.  I wish I could thank him personally.  I have lost some weight, but I mostly just wanted to feel better.  And I did.  Eliminating modern wheat from my diet removed the fatigue, brain fog, aches and pains, and I breathe better!  It was an adjustment, but I have plenty to eat and don't miss it at all.  I don't miss craving things all day long either.  It's a must read for those who want to know more about what they're putting into their bodies.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book Five was amazing!  I couldn't put it down.  It has left all of the major characters is a suspenseful limbo and I cannot wait for books six and seven.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a must read for everyone, esp. in today's times.  Viktor Frankl doesn't describe the horrors of the Nazi camps, as he claims, since those have been widely published.  He discusses how the survivors responded interiorly day in and day out to the horror of their situation.  It really puts things in perspective of how much of what we dislike or sacrifice or long for pales in comparison to more horrid situations.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I saw the movie originally just out of curiosity. I bought the movie to show others. It sparks great discussion on cultural diversity, child development, survival, and thankfulness.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY FUN. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!I have been playing for like 3 days and I'm addicted. The price is amazing for such an awesome game.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Every bit as entertaining as Discovery and Human After All.  Euro disco and techno roots come out cleanly, with some new tricks and flavor we've come to expect from Daft Punk.  Several tracks that could be hits on mainstream radio, as well as the deeper stuff which less commercial and is more listener-centric.<br /><br />If you like &#34;Get Lucky&#34; you won't be disappointed.  There are a few tracks on this album which surpass it as a pop song, in my estimation.
B008476HBM|5.0|I've heard of this book before so when I seen it, it yelled out to me &#34; read me&#34;. And like any normal person I did!!!
0307730697|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read this book.  I'm not fully certain why, maybe partly because I knew how it would end, I knew where the book was headed.  Yet, Fearless is an excellent book.  It's not just a military book, it's the story of a man, a hero, a man who was fearless with his life, willing to sacrifice for others.<br /><br />Sadly, most of the press we receive about the wars we are engaged in are negative.  While there is sadness in this book, we see Adam Brown as a valiant man who placed God first, even though he had to endure consequences from his sins and mistakes.  Brown's life was changed when he met Jesus in a grimy Arkansas jail cell.  His problems didn't go away, but his life dramatically changed.  He became a changed and different man.  He was devoted to his wife, family and his Navy SEALs team.<br /><br />The author did his work.  He spoke to family and friends of Adam Brown.  We learn about the dedication Adam had in overcoming many injuries to become a SEAL.  We gain insight into the generosity Adam displayed to people wherever he went.  He even helped organize a drive in his church to send shoes to Afghan children when he learned they had to wear open sandals during the cold and brutal mountain winters.  He tried to make the world a better place by making a difference in the lives of others.<br /><br />His loyalty to his team was shown in their loyalty to him.  When he was shot multiple times and badly wounded his team made heroic efforts to save him and get him to a hospital.  This was a powerful book to read.  It pulled my emotions in many directions.  I would highly recommend this book to others.<br /><br />I received this free book from Blogging for Books, from Multnomah Press.  My opinions are based on my reading of this book and I was not compelled to give a positive review.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Very similar to the first book. I had to take a break from reading it because it was too similar and that was frustrating.<br />Once I started reading again it was better.<br />Ending is very anti-climactic.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was pleased to be able to search and buy a little known book written by a member of our church!  I love the way it quickly brings up the page I left off with.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|10+ excellent writing and vocals. First saw her on you tube and now she's on my playlist regularly!  Keep soaring!
B0086DBE62|4.0|I enjoyed the movie on a long flight.  It was funny with enjoyable actors and the storyline was different enough from the fairytale that it was a tad unpredictable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great show, I was able to start this from the beginning and watch it all the way through for free with Prime - love it!!
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|The show continues to move away from its very interesting historical context towards a full-on soap opera. Last few episodes were a struggle to watch.
B00847KFDS|4.0|I've been a John Fogerty/CCR fan since the late 60's.  I've got almost all the CCR and Fogerty albums.  This one far exceded my expectations.  The only song that doesn't really excite me is &#34;Born on the Bayou&#34; with Kid Rock.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great story. Loved the nature. Loved the spirituality. Would recommend and read again. Would like to read other similar books.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Finally a timeless endearing wonderful story.my sons were raised on tin tin and asterix. No disappointment in any frame. Such a high quality action film, that happens tobe animated.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I had seen all the episodes before, but wanted the collection.<br />The action is believable and gripping. I can recommend it to all mature audiences.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice balance of fun and challenge. Found myself completing all 10 levels in my spare time within days. I too will be looking forward to future levels.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I can't get enough of this show. I just love it! Was so sad to hear that they had cancelled it after the second season.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This CD is a must have for John Fogerty / Creedence Clearwater Revival fans.<br />Love that the CD was available in my cloud player before I even received the CD. Great bonus.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|At first the book seemed slow and too descriptive. However, once I adjusted to this style, I was entranced. The fight between good and evil was compelling. Five stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is wayyyyyyyyyy better than temple run because I  don't know this game is just way better than temple run and they should do subway surfers New York not that I live there it would just be really cool. Also I am trying to get spike but he's so hard to get so I just play as Jake I think his name is but I do have tricky but i just don't play as here.
B0044AFHXC|1.0|I did not know I was getting a chinesse dvd  I dont even like china so I sure wouldnt buy that piece of s***  I am sending it back and reorder the right one.  i dont even know why you sell that stuff and mixed it with the engish stuff  please change your site not mixing stuff up
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE GAME OF AWESOMENESS AND A DOODLE JUMPING THAT'S FREAK IN AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!! Anther awesome thing about this is that I have played this before on my sister's I pod and now it's on my kindle fire.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Great product, works great, feels comfortable, doesn't get dirtied easily.<br /><br />only down side is you cannot program the side mouse buttons to custom game buttons, as in they can only be bound to pre-existing keys....
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game on kindle fire is really hard but it makes it so that u can get red and blue coins and on the regular temple run on kindle fire I think you could only get yellow coins but whenever I'm bored I always play this game and when my cousins come over we all ways yell out if we have red or blue coins but I think subway suffers is more fun than this app.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|If you love musicals and show tunes, this is perfect. The storyline is engaging and maintains your interest. You can't help get caught up in the drama.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very user friendly.  I have it installed on several devices. My 10 year old daughter uses it as well.  Love it!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|got for my dads birthday as a &#34;memory lane&#34; of my childhood gift.  he is going to be 78 years old
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is the first time that I watched the movie before reading the book and I must say the movie is actually better than the book in my opinion. This RARELY happens, so definitely check out this movie!
B006CBSE86|2.0|Imaginaerum is a decent album but probably one of my least liked Nightwish albums. To be honest I have quite a love hate relationship with this band, I dig alot of their works but some of their stuff is well... lets just keep this PC and say it's not for me.<br />I found myself bored of this album after only a few listens, and honestly besides a couple tracks nothing really stands out and really took me away. If you are a major fan of Nightwish you will probably love it though. But songs like Slow, Love Slow for example make me want to press the next track button as soon as possible. I still like this band and I will always buy their albums unless they release some acoustic only deal. However, Imaginaerum is a mediocre effort and failed to hold me.<br /><br />Songs I did enjoy: Ghost River, I Want my Tears Back, and Song of Myself
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I know an 8 month old who loves this movie and a 54 year old! Has a positive message that everyone needs to know!
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|Dark Roots of Earth is an impressive thrash metal album. It's heavy, aggressive, and the vocals are imposing. The album flows together well, and I always want to listen to it again when it's over as there is never a dull moment. As a Game of Thrones fan I really love the Throne of Thorns track about the Mad King Targaryen. Testament proves once again they are a force to be reckoned with and that Thrash is very much alive and crushing it. I recommend getting the deluxe version with the cover songs, they are very well done.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the album are: Man Kils Mankind, Throne of Thorns, and Rise Up
B005FISBTO|5.0|If you follow this series, then you cannot go wrong with buying the sixth season. They just keeping getting better and better.
B00CCEHV18|5.0|As a long time fan of CoB their dissapointing release of Relentless Reckless Forever had my outlook on the band as pretty negative, Don't let that shy you away, Halo of Blood will take a scythe and shove it up your ass and leave you to die in the cold air of Finland. The title track itself is brutal and relentless, we also get some nice tastes of old Bodom in there, although they have kept their crisp modern sounds. I do feel their lead and melodic tone has suffered a bit over the years, so if you are expecting a neo classical sound of Hatebreeder or Something Wild, forget it. But if you want the aggression of Hatecrew Deathroll, and Blooddrunk and also a bit of the melody from Follow the Reaper and Are You Dead Yet? You will recieve it here. The only track I thought was weak was Dead Man's Hands on You. I don't mind slower mild tempo songs but it just doesn't work with Children of Bodom, they are all about speed, aggression, and harmonics. Other than that this album blew my mind, and reawakened the fan in me for the band, and I look forward to seeing them live soon.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the album are: Bodom Blue Moon, Transference, and All Twisted
B003EYVXTQ|1.0|I buy this ítem... But i try to see it one week later and it didnt work!!!!!  im not sure if i can reclam but i think i deserve minimun de money back
B009C5Z112|5.0|Seriously this record was a decade in the making. Wintersun put out their first masterpiece back in 2004. All of us fans were eager to hear this so called Time record after Jari announced it back in like what 2005? Well this goddamn masterpiece was worth the wait. The cold frozen atmosphere returns with the power riffs, crushing drums, and neo classical melodies mixed with emotion. The lyrics are poetic and well written. Wintersun is the metal band that will tear your heart out if you let them. Seriously try to get through Land of Snow and Sorrow without shedding a couple of tears. The whole album melds into one and is quite the trip, there are some relaxing moments, and some moments that make you want to get up and mosh in your living room. I cannot wait for Time part 2. As a huge Wintersun fan I also could not be pleased more with this album. Keep it up Jari!<br /><br />Favorite track: Time
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|By far one of the BEST virtual puzzles ever! I would have preferred a deeper plot and a much longer puzzle, but the attention to detail and puzzle challenges make it well worth the time, money, and 5-Star rating! Looking forward to seeing much more from this company!
B009IA3O2O|3.0|Kamelot brings us another effort in the form of Silverthorn. The entire album tells us a story, not one that particularly grabbed me. There are some good moments on this album but it's mostly forgetable. I like it alot better than the last one however. I know Roy Khan left the band but I hardly noticed, the new guy does a real good job and has a great voice. In fact I would go to say the vocals are probably the strong point of Silverthorn, the instrumental stuff is pretty weak for Kamelot. There wasn't really any tracks on here that I think stand out better amongst Kamelot's other songs. I would just pass this one up if you are not a major fan of the group.<br /><br />My favorite tracks off the album are: Veritas, My Confession, and Solitaire
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Shine Runner is an excellent game for idling away time.  Controls are simple and straight forward, graphics are good and the storyline is entertaining.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is a great read. I look forward to reading more by Sylvia Day.
B001P3SA94|5.0|After having seen the young girl sing to Etta James and then reviewing the songs on Amazon....I had to purchase the movie. No one has the selection like Amazon
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The show is enjoyable there are a lot of twists and turns that keep you coming back for more and more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the short time I played the game. I wish there were more games like this. I can't wait for more levels.
B00CL151G4|3.0|We have watched each episode this season and eagerly awaited the DVD of the entire season.  Great disappointment that there are no captions in English for hearing impaired people.  This may be a deal breaker as my wife has lost most all her hearing and we depend on English captions!  Please add them to future releases!  Thanks.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Very fun... Keeps you busy for hours on end.<br />Its only 99 cents what a deal go buy it now
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This is very awesome but sometimes it takes two or three times before it converts the item(s) also it would be cool if there was skins or if it could be available on I phones or iPods, but other then that this app is gruel th helpful and awesome. I'm so happy that there is even an app like this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that this game is a game that has a thrilling experience to it and basically make anything you desire. Its seven dollars worth but its all worth it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Normally TV is disappointing after such monstrously successful movies, but Sarah Connor Chronicles is excellent story telling. Multiple character development is high drama.
B007REV4T8|5.0|What more can I say than that Daniel Craig is superb and the story line beautifully written and flows.  The title song is simply captivating and makes me want to see the move over and over and marvel at how well the song ties into the story line.  Best Bond ever in my opinion!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book, it kept you reading and I couldn't put it down because of the action and detail. This book keeps you in suspense and keeps you wondering what will happen next.<br />I'm eager to read the second and third book sequel to the hunger games and can't wait to find out what happens next.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|What a delightful tale about the love of a broken family for their children and how sometimes only a murderous Jewish demon can remind you of what's really important in life. Additionally, Matisyahu is in this movie. I enjoyed it. In all honesty, I liked that the movie didn't rely on gore to creep out viewers and it was definitely cool to focus the movie around the Jewish faith since most (if not all other) religious movies focus around Christianity.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Ordered another kindle jacket and when it arrived it wouldn't fit-too small, even though it said it fir the original kindle. Thie one is  perfect. The color is rich, the engraved leather look looks 3 times as expensive as it cost. It was very easy to put on, and since I have only had it a short while I don't know how it will hold up but it looks plenty substantial.<br />I would definitely recommend this to family and friends. Shipping was very fast. But then Amazon always is.
037571457X|4.0|The book does shed insights into what happ.ened in Iran at the time of the revolt against Shah Reza Pahlvavi.  There are hints about why people in the Middle East distrust the United States.  The book is sensitive and a should read for all who have open minds.  but I do not consider thisa one of the ten best novels of the year.  It's good, but it isn't THAT good.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the story lines and acting.  I hope that as the series continues that the writers don't start to stretch for material.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I thought that kubricks adaptation was incredible, then I read burgess's original novel, holy crap, what a story, and the Nadsat language, fantastic!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Highly recomended...It is wonderful to have all six movies, Excellent quality. Great value for the cost as well. the best of the best!!!<br /><br />Fantastic!
B000ID1J0E|5.0|Its really such a great movie.  Nuff said, except I need sixteen words so... Only six more to go... Bam!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|needs to do more fun but gets very boring and exspensive it should have a way to get free pearls.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini does it again. This time, he skips around in time and place. This normally confuses me, but, in this case, he keeps things connected in such a way I can follow. Normally the number of characters and the strange names would also confuse me, but he has a way of reminding the reader who the people are and how they're related that again it's easy to keep track. The book reads like a set of separate stories, but by the end of each one there's a surprise tie-back to something that came before. It's a great description of life in Afganistan from the early 20th century through the first decade of the 21st. I felt like I got the feel of people of Afganistan, including expats in Europe and America. It's a good blend of tragedy and happiness.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I thought it took a while to get into the book, but enjoyed it after a tedious character development phase.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The second season is even better than the first! This si such a sweeping and complex series that keeps you completely involved.
0803726570|5.0|My grandsons loved this book.  It is one of their favorites for bedtime. They now each have a copy so there are no more fights about who holds it for mom or dad while it is being read.  The witch reminds me of me...not the personality...just the looks!! Great book and lots of fun to read.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Amazon has greatly enhaced it's services with the new implementation of video streaming,<br />and seamless playtback through the instant video IOS App.
0307408833|5.0|These are great!  I have made 3 recipes and loved them all, even the kids that don't have allergies love them.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Terrific. Exactly what was expected! J Cole is one of the best artists out right now. This was needed. Cole World
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I am enjoying this app.  It is a blast from the past.  It took me a little bit to get used to the controls (there were not any directions before you begin playing), but I am loving it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game i play it before every game Kobe always makes fun of me<br /><br />Hi but the fact of life in bikinis to bahamas the same thing as the fact fact fact that they
B00005QGAV|5.0|This album reminds me how great of an artist Michael is. I can't believe i dint already have this in my collection.
0307387178|4.0|In this book, a college graduate drops everything to live in the wild. I enjoyed the book; I thought it was interesting that Chris did something that many people are tempted to do but never get the nerve. I won't say more to avoid any spoilers, but the book kept my interest until the end. I would certainly recommend it.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Not one of my favorites! It is a fast read but story line is not great. It was somewhat of a bore to read!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A little short but a cool puzzle game. It kept me thinking throughout the harder levels.  I could play a game like this with more levels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each season gets better and better. I can't wait for the start of season 4 to start to see what happens
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is good to play but since the update I can't comb to my Facebook page. It makes me upset I can't link with my Facebook to keep my progress
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because I can play and get 1097 points. I love this because I can just gtab it and go goand play good.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is entertaining to compare old England to the family in the Dallas series and also modern America.  Excellent representation of family dynamics that still apply today.  Its &#34;Business as usual&#34; no matter what the time period or family and it makes for interesting entertainment.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was very good.<br />The characters, the plot and the action were all believable.<br />This character is much more believable than Jack Reacher.
0307743659|4.0|Just for fun, I read the bulk of this book while I was a guest at the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, which is the hotel that inspired Stephen King to write the novel. I'd sit in the lobby by the roaring fire, reading the book and then I'd wander into the ballroom or the bar where some of the best scenes in the story take place. It was sorta like an interactive reading experience and I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />And I would recommend the novel no matter where you read it. Its a classic haunted house tale with strange noises and ghosts and everything that goes with books in the genre. The main character is a guy named Jack Torrance, who is hired as the winter caretaker of a grand hotel that gets sealed off from the world by a Colorado snow storm. He's trapped in the hotel with his wife and young son, which is a really creative and scary situation. Throw in the fact that Jack is an alcoholic with a savage temper and the little boy has the shining, the ability to see events both past and future and the stage is set for a great read.<br /><br />The book contains several excellent passages on the consequences of excessive drinking and King has commented that some of the \\"horrors\\" the main character encounters in the hotel are symbols of some of the horrors of real life. The novel is full of action and suspense and, although a little overwritten in a few places, is a fun read whether you're spending time at the beach or in an isolated old hotel in the mountains of Colorado.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I like her music and many of the songs on this album. Unfortunately, the song I was looking for was Read All About it, which was not included. I found it a little deceptive as during my searches for that particular song, it was featured with this album cover. However, the overall album was good. - The shipping was extremely fast; more than pleased with that.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|We'd love to see more movies like this.  No double entendre's, no need to act naughty to be cool.  Just a lot of great entertainment and good life lessons.
B0046B6X1E|5.0|Carrie demonstrates the classic King theme of the ordinary darkness that exists in everyday life. The abusive relationship of John Travolta's character and his girlfriend, Carrie's abusive zealot mother, the cruelty of the other girls to her. It's well acted, heart felt and Sissy Spacek as the title character is vulnerable and likable. It's hard not to root for her even after her true horrific power is revealed. Carrie is a great example of the 80s, of the ultimate outsider and of a great horror movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome!!!! I just love this series and guess what? Cliffhanger! There will be another book. They are together at the end of the book and have taken their relationship to the next level. The writing is excellent and the story just flows. I love Eva and Gideon, they are both messed up and they know it but they are working on it. I can't wait for the next book
B00BF11UM0|5.0|I'm sure there are a few inaccuracies in the movie, but it is a well done film that I think everyone should see.  The film is an entertaining way to concisely see how things evolved from 9/11 until the raid on Bin Laden's compound as seen from the eyes of the CIA.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|I love Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams, they are great together.  Its a really good movie, your basic Chick Flick that happens to be based on a true story.
1451648537|5.0|even though i didn't finish reading the book, but the book is pretty inspiring and I learned a lot from there
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Heartbreaking at  Times but  I could not stop reading what was going to be the ending for this man who had been through so much
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|addictive...didn't think it'd be my thing but next thing you know I'm playing for 2hours. Looks kinda lame but is more fun than you think.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This was a free app of the day and the best jigsaw puzzle app I have found so far.  It allows you to rotate your pieces and you can choose to play up to 250 pieces.  These are puzzles adults can enjoy.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|Discs have multiple dead spots on them. I did not play the discs immediately after receiving them so By the time I did the return date had passed. I tried the discs in different machines with the same result. If you buy this make sure you watch all three disks as soon as you receive them. I won't buy anymore discs from amazon.
B00DM12ANO|5.0|This little gem was a great find. Very creative and original. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun game to play... if you need time to pass; and if you like games that make you think
B005S9EKCW|4.0|There are a lot of good things about the movie though I agree with some reviews that Javear (sp?) could have used more emotion in the singing.<br /><br />I got to see Hugh Jackman live in Boy from Oz and look forward to him singing in anything these days!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The whole game can be unlocked for ten dollars which is worth it for this app if you are a fan of Magic for as long as I have. The interface is intuitive and easy to access and reminds me of playing on a tabletop.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Heartfelt, wonderful writing with characters I fell in love with! Great read and easy to relate to if you've ever been through a similar phase of life
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's a very good app and it really helps a lot.It tells you how much battery you have and remember I am very awesome bye.
B00CE03UOC|3.0|The sound is a little annoying but I'll still play it. I really enjoy these puzzle games. Three more words.
B005J2UM9S|1.0|Pretty irritated that I couldn't even watch it. It never streamed on my computer. Other than that, I have no idea how the actual movie is. At least Amazon was understanding on refunding my money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved playing this game and so did my kids. Can't wait for more levels! Took some time to get started, but once we got going we could not stop.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Quirky premise, heart-warming love story and laugh-out-loud funny moments.  In other words a perfect book to read when you want to feel better about life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Lydia love the game subway surfer!!(: I play it every day and I plan to for the rest of my life!I think that everyone should have subway surfer!from,Lydia Abigail Orme
B008133MDK|5.0|Though set in modern times, this really captures the energy and characters in the original stories.  I like that Watson is more like the book and not at all like the foil he plays in the black & white movies.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like that the colors were bright and the tiles are easy to identify. I liked the different lay outs for the games.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|We bought this to use with a TV/Monitor in a rental RV -- we clamped it to the table on the back side, and were able to leave the TV there the whole trip without leaving any marks or having to worry about it while driving.<br /><br />The arm was flexible enough to allow turning it to use while sitting at the table as an extra monitor for my laptop, or to stick out and perfect for angling down for comfortable watching from the couch on the other side of the RV as a TV, yet it was stiff enough to avoid having it swing back and forth while we were driving.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|there is no hint key to help if you get stuck on a level.  i don't recommend this at all.
B004TI5N38|5.0|If you like David Baldacci you will like this book.  A great addition to his books.  You can't miss with this one.
B005USZML4|5.0|Well written and intriguing.  I enjoy reading about kids adventures and how they problem solve without much help from adults.
B00AM7E4LM|5.0|Everybody should read this book. A must have. Simple steps to learn everything. Don't miss this book out. It has improved my learning skills.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|my six year old loved this game. he was learning to be patient while earning pearls without buying them with real money. after the new version, the treasure chests required pearls to open them. since he is on a higher level, the &quot;server is not responding &quot;. very disappointed.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What is not to like? 100 year old man who doesn't want to be in a nursing home outwitting a criminal gang and ending up in a tropical paradise.
B000J4KDOA|5.0|The Spy Who Came in From the Cold takes the reader back to the darkest days of divided Berlin in the 1960's via the character of Alex Leamas, a world-weary veteran of the espionage world who is sent on one last mission behind the Iron Curtain.  No James Bond he, Leamas is depicted as a has-been gone to seed, and we are privileged to read his fortune via the prose of a true master, John leCarre.  I heartily recommend this book to all fans of spy mysteries, as you will find a friend for life in this and all other works of leCarre.
B0026WNGBA|1.0|Very disappointed with this book. It is basically New Age mumbo jumbo with minimal concrete instruction. Complete waste of money and time. Go on You Tube and look up Pose Running Exercises and you'll learn more about this style of running than this book will tell you.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Looking forward to more of these!! A great addition to the franchise! I really enjoyed the Hulk in this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice challenging puzzle.  I am ready for more levels now. Enjoyed the different hiding methods and types of challenge.  More, please.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Requires a little patience if you don't want to spend any money, but this is by far the cutest dragon game out there!
B000HF2NTE|5.0|You want an 80's movie - this is the one! Great locations (I recognize a lot of them!) and Sly at his best!
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|I went to a Kendrick Lamar concert and J Cole came out then I fell in love..So I am not a native Cole fan and Ill be honest about that so this is from not a Groupie view.<br /><br />I must admit I always listen to music for the first time in my car ..Thats where I get the best sounds...This album had to grow on me the first time I was like Eh there are some really good tracks and his Lrics are Beast! But the beats were just not my stlye.  I like Cole and his message but I need more and expect more at this point I am from the south and beats are inportant to me..I fi want lyrics write a book and Ill but it but for my music ....Let the track play I like to say...Just not my  cup of tea but I support the art
B005MHI0QM|4.0|I visited Amsterdam and the Anne Frank annex building in June, 2013. I decided to reread her Diary after visiting the building, even though it has been 55years since I first read it. I recommend anyone that read the diary as a teen, to reread it as you age.  Her courage, maturity and understanding of the mind and soul are a gift.  Although you know how the diary ends, you want her to survive.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|After purchasing the app I keep receiving an error message stating I do not own the at when I try to open it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love Love Love this series, eagerly awaiting the sequel!! Can't get enough of it! Have reread the story 2 times in the last month and find things still yet that I still get from it~~ Give us more more more!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This has saved me so much time on my battery by using the &#34;Task Killer&#34;.  It will stop any apps running in the background which can use up your battery, then it will tell you how many minutes you have saved by running it.  Definitely recommend.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Really great mind game! I wish it was longer that's why I took a star off. Other than that it took real brain power, and a great test of your memory. I want more rooms!!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|I would say I've listened to this album at least 20 times now.  It's one of the best workout albums I've ever had because of the industrial feel...mixed with how angry it is at times.  I really like it a lot now.  Having said that, I understand reviews from people who don't like it.  I listened to the first few tracks, and my first thought was, \\"Oh no.  I really, really hate this.\\"  I am a person who likes to listen to music that I'm unfamiliar with while I work on other things, so I put it on while I was doing paperwork.  A few songs started to grow on me.  Then I worked out to it, and realized how great \\"Black Skinheads\\" and \\"New Slaves\\" are.  While I don't think this album flows together as well as some of his past work does, I do think it is noteworthy as one of the better albums of the year.  I honestly think that all of the passionately mixed views on this album (from people who think it's not music, to people who give it a 10) come from the simple fact that Kanye's name is on it.  If this album came from anyone else, I think it would be about an 8.  There's no way people would hate it this much.<br />Personally, I respect that Kanye decided to make an album that is basically unplayable on the radio.  He cares more about music as an artform than as a commercial industry...at least that's what it seems to me.<br />If you hate Kanye, I don't think this album is going to change your mind.  I don't like him outside of his music, but I really love his vulnerability in his music.  I think he's one of the few people owning his flaws and painting an honest picture of himself.  \\"Hold My Liquor\\" is so great for that.  You get to hear him describe his failure in a relationship...criticisms of himself come out in an interesting way.<br />I docked it a star because I'm not crazy about how lazy his sexism can be at some points.  He has a line in \\"Bound 2\\" where he says, \\"Fresh hair cut, straight out the salon b***h,\\" for no reason.  I get that rap is sexist in general, butthere's no commentary to be had from that line.  And he's really filthy at certain points, and I guess I just don't have the stomach that I thought I had for it.  I love \\"Hell of a Life\\" from Twisted Fantasy, which gets pretty dirty, but in Yeezus, he takes it to another level with a few verses.<br />This album isn't Twisted Fantasy.  It isn't College Dropout or 808's.  It's something a lot different, and I respect Kanye's ability to throw out the mold and take a risk.  I think it pays off.  Can't wait to see where he goes from here.<br /><br />I hope you're able to give it the proper chance, and not close yourself off from it just because it is a little uncomfortable to listen to at first.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a great little app that you can install on your kindle!  Terrific for quick or complicated calculations relating to any budgeting topic that comes up between you and the spouse :)
B005TLYES4|5.0|I love the Smiths.. One of there best albums. Its right up there with the Queen is Dead and Strangeways here we come.
B00919CI5Q|1.0|I will not be buying  with this company again. graphics card was defective out of the box. the day I got the card, the next day I sent it right back! I ended up buying the *NEW* EVGA GeForce GTX 760 SC W/ ACX cooler. I recommend you guys DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!!!! 95% of the chance you WILL get a bad card!!!! O AND TROLLS AND LITTLE KIDS IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS REVIEW THEN F*** OFF THANK YOU
0312944098|3.0|This is my first book by Jeffrey Archer and I can't wait to read others. I thought the story started out slow but picked up quite a bit in e middle to the point I didn't want to put it down.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent combination of dramatic legal wrangling and human interest.  First rate script.  Julianna Margules is absolutely terrific!  Excellent cast - Christine Baransky, Chris Noth, Josh Charles - all believable characters.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I liked it because it was so funny and because of everything<br />It's so cute every boy my class gets these books cuz it is so funny.
B00BU18U82|5.0|My sons & daughters love it!!  They can't get enough of it. They want more farm equipment and new tractors.  Great game for any one!!
B004VD3YIM|2.0|To be fair the camera app works as described and rates 4 stars based on it alone.  However, since the last Amazon app store app upgrade all apps free or paid for through the app store require you to login to amazon each time you use the app or the app won't run.  If they did this for apps advertised as free it would be wrong but no loss since you paid nothing and can get the same free apps from other sources.  But to require login for an app you bought and paid for, like this cam app, is more then wrong it boarders on scam!<br /><br />I don't want to here android 4.2 is the cause crap either.  Amazon's app store app, before their upgrade, did not have this. I also don't want to here they are working on it.  They should provide the older app store app and send out an update or back date notice to everyone unfortunate enough to have downloaded the latest update.  Sorry for the harsh words but this situation is nothing more then an ill thought out control mechanism and Amazon should know better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is fun and a little addicting.. It gets your mind moving and gets you To<br />Think outside the Box.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Anyone who enjoys Broadway will enjoy this behind the curtain look at the creating of a Broadway show. The musical numbers are a treat.
1401937268|5.0|I bought these cards because of a friend, but when I got the cards and read through them I was intrigue by the artwork. This is a great intuitive tool.
B003MS7V8G|2.0|It's just a silly movie and a waste of time.  At least other movies in this genre like something Chocolate is more entertaining, better acting and script.  Just silly, very silly and a waste of time.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I must confess, I very rarely enjoy self published books, but this one was a complete surprise. The book is excellent. There are some grammar mistakes and problems with some sentence structure, but the story is amazing. No one can create a novel of this size with perfect structuring without publishers/professional editors. I have to give the author credit for the lack of mistakes. I'm usually a harsh critic of even novels, even the  ones I love because my expectations are that every book will be The Name of the wind, A Storm of Swords, or The Deathly Hallows. This author did a great job and I will be buying the second book as soon as it is available.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Beautifully written - hated to see it end!  Characters were well developed and the story line was awesome.  Will read more from this author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable read, king makes you believe your back in the late 50s with the main character, give it a read
0425263991|5.0|Nalini Singh never disappoints, and this was no exception. Her characters were amazingly well written and I was invested in their story from the very first paragraph. I highly recommend any and all books written by Nalini Singh.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Conelly writes with flair, imagination and page-turning timing. If you haven't read his books and like detective stories you are missing one of the best.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|Had this one in hard cover and after reading it thought it was a keeper.  I can read books again if they are interesting , unusual or just a great read.  This is one of those books, storyline is good, well written and easy to read. Well done to the author and have now purchased the other books to read as well
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing story line with suspense throughout the whole book. Found all of her books to be great, this was by far the best one!
B007FU1OH6|4.0|Still haven't got to this book yet ...  Purchased them for my trip coming up so will get around to it
B005COO1X6|4.0|Very classic Stephen King style.  Good story, well written and just enough creepiness to keep you interested and I need 3 more words
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|was and still is one of the better movies from that time. Under rated but still as good as it always was.
B000HL093A|5.0|It's a great movie. If you're 25 and under, you probably don't have the frame of reference of the 90s to enjoy the movie fully, but if you do, it's great.  High re-watchability, too.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Dark Shadows is surprisingly a wonderfully entertaining adaptation of the decades-ago series of the same title. The magic is fun, the story is clear & easy to follow, & Johhny brings on Barnibus Collins character to such a degree that you feel you're actually living in the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought this game rocked! It was so fun to be challenged. You definitely have to be someone who has to touch everything and see what it does. And I was one of those kids who got in trouble for it and am one now as  an adult. It is encouraged in &quot;The Room&quot;.<br /><br />Great fun!
B008220BLG|5.0|Loved this movie. Warm Bodies provides a fresh take on zombiism, one that makes you believe therse creatures -- & the cure -- could really exist. A juxtapositional underpinning brings out a real-world comparison bewtween the B. F. Skinner hate-mongers (i.e., zombies) & humanists. Ah, wouldn't it be grand if all we had to do to fix the ugliness in the world was to tell all the elitists in the world that we love them & want to be their friend?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like the game how challenging it is.I like how u have to find a way out and try to find all the items.it gets me interesting to the game.:)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and challenging enough to keep me, an engineer, thinking. I really get a kick out of finding the keys.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The book series was very good but I  think that the first one was the best. I really do like these book and I wish she would write more. I also can't wait for the movies to come out.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Entertaining enough, but the making up of the team took a bit too long. Also like to see Black Widow doing more awesome fight scenes like in the beginning and less of her standing there shooting guns.  The banter is funny, but the wardrobe is terrible.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|James Franco was thoroughly annoying in this film. I can't decide if it was his character or his over-the-top acting. Disappointing since the subject has so much potential.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Just finished playing the game and really had a good time. I'm not very good at these game that have you running all over place looking for thing to put in your inventory. But with the clues and the help of the book the game was fun without the frustration of being stuck
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very compelling, no dull parts. I whole-heartedly endorse this novel! I've read this author's prior novels and this one is on par with his others.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|great. only thing i dont like js the fact that you didn't have to start at level 1 again when you die!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|If you don't play online puzzle games then this may not be the app to start with. For some it may be fun and easy, I just moved the room around a lot, got a little into the puzzle, felt I figured out what to do, only to get frustratingly jammed and gave up. I am more of a person who plays games like Simpsons Tapped Out, Pou, Block Breaker, Card Games, so I am pretty foreign to puzzles. If you say, that sounds like me! Then you and I would be sitting in this room throwing rocks. If you say, no, I am good at puzzles, I am probably not a very good review of the game.<br /><br />Edit: Gave this to my nephew who is a puzzle genius and he was moving through the game pretty well. He did get bored though and handed it back to me. I guess unless there are zombies that will come out of the box once you solve it, and he can shoot them, it was not a lot of fun. So, the game is solvable with someone who is a good gamer. I will stick to games that I can just click on things and they work. I am not an idiot, I hold a Master's degree, but puzzles are just not my thing.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|It is a great download with great songs.  Can't stop watching it and singing along to it from the kindle.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Nice colour, runs cool, low power, instant on and good price. I use in a lamp and works great, would definitely recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft you place blocks and try to survive the night you mine and craft swords to kill mobs ( mobs are monsters like zombies creepers skeletons and spiders ) there are pigs cows and sheep you collect wool from sheep and lether and beef from cows and pork chops from pigs.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I've enjoyed getting to know the characters in this book (though they're not as complex as I'd like), but the story didn't really accomplish much.  It felt like a bunch of little mini stories had wrapped up and were about to be rolled into one larger story arc for the book, but then the book just ended.  This might be acceptable considering it is the first book in a series, but it really doesn't leave me wanting to read the rest, especially at the price for a relatively short kindle edition.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|This is just an amazing CD altogether. Alison knocks it out of the park. She is such a great player. This is a MUST HAVE for any trumpet player. Everyone can learn something from Ms Balsom.
B005LAII4E|1.0|If you expect to see modern-futuristic technology, like in the first one GI joe, or the sames actors, no need to lost your time or your money<br />I was very disappointed, i found the movie very boring, and  ... nothing to compare with the first one<br />Just a classic today's action/war movie with normal guns and vehicles
B008602KQI|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies released in the past year. I thought all of the actors were outstanding. This is a must have for any movie buff.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Great script and outstanding acting! Sorry to see this is the last season for the current Doctor Who, as he is one of the best!
067101756X|5.0|This was a great page turner. Sent to my son who is quite the enthusist (?). He did move without taking this book so it is his second one.
B004478AS4|5.0|Achebe's most famous novel is a great lens through which to consider colonization past and present. Recommended to just about anyone.
B0012GMYTG|5.0|I own this album and I love every song on minus wind-up toy because it creeps me out. But The rest of the songs on this album are great, Love's A Loaded Gun is such a sad amazing song, you really feel sorry for the guy described in the song. Might As Well Be on Mars, is wow just wow awesome song. I love Alice Cooper been listening to him for a long time now and well what can I say? he's amazing great artist. Would say this is a must buy if only for Love's A Loaded gun I love that song. It's one of my favorites from this album.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is a great movie denzel is amazing in this film. this is probably the best acting I've seen him do since john q and man on fire. but all around he is an amazing actor and just to have john goodman in the film for his short time made it better. rob did a good job on making this film. I would have to say that this is is best since back to the future. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I feel like I waited forever for this book and it left a lot of unanswered questions.  I thought this was going to be the last book.  Hopefully it's not because if it is, it is an awful way to end the series.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then I recommend you do
B009R659L8|5.0|What a great book.  Another winner for Mary Higgins Clark.  Couldn't put it down until I was done.  When will her next book be out?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Psychological/legal thriller told ftom unusual perspective. Totally worth the read. Interesting point of view. Story sticks with you. Hard to put down.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|When I play any game it is to relax and I don't need time pressures or strategy that could be used at NASA. That's why I love this mahjong. The music is soothing and I can ignore any timer and just complete it with relaxing satisfaction.
B007SGM084|5.0|These three delicious books are the most wonderful books I've read yet. I've heard there was a baby boom from the books so I thought  I would  try since we have been trying for over a year now.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I only played a little of the free version before purchasing the complete game.  The full game is very nice as long as you are familiar with the trading card game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I highly recommend this book ! Helps you escape reality and has a heart warming moral to the story. Good kid's book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This product keeps you busy and its easy to play for beginners to but I dont think that the avatars should cost so much because I don't play all the time and you only earn if you play so I give it a 4.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is pretty fun. It's pretty much temple run, just a different version or something. It has a lot of updates. I think it has to MANY updates, though. I still suggest that you get it. It's a little addicting!! GET IT! :-)<br />-USED BY A KINDLE FIRE-
B003O86FMW|5.0|You can see the time Suzanne put into writing this book. It felt more developed than the books that preceded. I really don't get why publishers rush writers to finish books. It really makes for a lackluster sequal.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really like this game, its like wheres my water, just...BETTER! It's really not just for kids, even though it has cartoony things. It's TOTALLY worth $.99, I strongly recommend it, it's a great time killer! My one complaint is that in the free version of this, it only has 13 levels (Including the bonus one). If they added a few more on, I would be very happy!! Runs smooth on my kindle fire.<br />-USED BY A KINDLE FIRE-
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was a fast read, I just felt the plot was a bit stale, and could of been more elaborate.
B00594XOZU|5.0|When people say &quot;this is fast&quot;, they mean it!! I own the app too, and I am BEYOND satisfied. Kik is my favorite social app. I agree, you should be able to enter in a keyword instead of the FULL username. Many people have this app, so your friends probably have it to! You really should get it!!<br />-USED BY A KINDLE FIRE-
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a very awesome show. We love it. I am going to recommend it to everyone I know and more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is simple and fun. You really have to be quick when running with your character. The only thing I could do without is how expensive everything is.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Great action. Great take on the classic. Awesome effects. New Kirk and Spock do a great job. Two thumbs up.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Very fast shipping. exelent product. couldn't be more satisfied.<br />Not a big fan of the sheath but I knew about it before I purchased it.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Lots of action and twists. Really kept my mind in it. Also great to see Gerard Butler's naked butt lol
B002JXK5VU|5.0|My kids think I'm weird, but I love this show!  The characters play off each other well and the sticky wickets they get themselves into are often hilarious.  Sheriff Carter often finds himself out of his comfort zone.  Just plain fun and entertaining.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Didn't want the story of Gideon and Eva to end. I was so disappointed with the way the story &#34;ended&#34;. I hope it wont be too long before the next book/s come out.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|An easy to learn farm that keeps you guessing.  Good for emptying the mind before bed.  Escape becomes more interesting with each new room you enter.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Another fabulous cd.  If your a fan you will love it. If you dont know Beth Hart then you are in for a real treat.
B00594XOZU|1.0|this game is not working on my kindle. I tried to download it but it always tells me to try again later.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Definitely put this movie on your back burner. When it's available for free on Prime or Netflix or wherever, you should pull it up and enjoy it. It just isn't good enough to pay extra for in my opinion.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Has always been on the top of my Hepburn/Grant collaborations! What a great screwball comedy, never disappoints no matter how many times I've watched it!
B003TH14H4|5.0|great show. I try to figure out along with Castle to see if I can solve the crime. Love it.
B002S0KB1S|5.0|Best book I have read in years. Enjoyed every moment of it. Ozzy you rock. Another 5 stars for Sharon.
B0016CVN02|5.0|This album is predominantly made of mastered singles throughout the Rolling Stones' prolific beginning. There are a few live tracks on disc 2 but that's about it so you're getting decent quality audio for what is ostensibly a pleasurable experience with one of the greatest rock bands of all times.
B005KR6OBM|4.0|All the the DVD's were in pretty good condition other than one missing its episode guide, my product was excellent.
B00632HWOG|3.0|it worked good and was easy to read, but just used WAY too much data, not sure if there's a way to get around this
B00821PCJS|5.0|this is one of the greatest apocalyptic alien invasion shows I have ever seen!! amazing acting,<br />concepts, plot twists, characters, just everything!!
B006T3RM08|5.0|I love I love very simple and neat my keyboard and my trackpad fit in very comfortably i would recommend it to every
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesomeness!!<br />Can't put it down. Good mind work!!! My kid and I play it and makes him think of the possibilities that there are!! Him and I enjoy it very much ...I amazed myself when my kid beats me to it!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Oz the Great And Powerful was a great movie. It was just a pure delight to watch. You won't waste your $ watching it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked the progression of their relationship, but too many things were left without resolution and new things were added, spreading the storylines too thin. I liked their love scenes but some seemed gratuitous. Gideon was awesome. Eva didn't seem as strong as she was in the other book.
030789701X|5.0|It looks fantastic, worth that alone for any huge Skyrim fan (and the incredible maps) and provides some amazing insight into the game world.  For the most part, almost everything in the guide is available online for free, but there is something to be said about paging through the hundreds of maps, reading the snippets from the Bethesda developers and insight they provided the guides author, and having all of the (massive) amount of information collected together in an easy to navigate single tome.<br /><br />If you are a first time Skyrim player, I would highly recommend this.  If you have played through the entire game and are just looking for information on the expansions however, it might not be worth the money to you.  That said, if you have the money to spare, I can not imagine anyone would be unsatisfied with this book if they are a fan of the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a neat game my daughter plays it mostly<br />It's just like temple run so it's easy to play there isn't anything else to say about it other that that... easy.. simple... kids game.
B008476HBM|4.0|Good book a little difficult to keep up with at times<br />.but enjoyed reading it. Would recommend this book highly
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Jobs will go down as the Edison of our generation.  Isaacson apparently had total access to Jobs, his family and his colleagues and he details in the book everything from his early influences to his last difficult days.  In addition to learning about Jobs, I now understand better why I have turned to Apple products over others.  It is unfortunate that we will not have Jobs for another 20 years or so, as it would have been fun to watch him continue to change the way we do things.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This author kept you wondering whether Jacob reallly did kill..  The author delved into the guilt side of parental concern for their children in a beautiful way. If you like mysteries, you'll love this story.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|been a fan of the john carter of mars series ever since I started reading burroughs at age 9, and have long awaited a film adaptation of the books. and i wasn't disappointed. while there were a few things i would have tweaked and changed, like giving the green men real tusks instead of horns, and, perhaps, had a screenplay that was closer and more faithful to the original stories in the book, i really enjoyed this film adaptation, and stanton's take, on barsoom; especially woola. (shame disney dropped the ball on the merchandising and marketing of the film.)<br /><br />a fun film, lots of good old style adventure and some really cool special effects!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Over all I think this is a great app for many ages ranging from eight year olds to 40 year olds.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Usually I can figure out where a book is going, but in this one I was never sure. It kept me in suspense until the bitter end. I have to say I was mad at how the book ended, but it definitely kept me intrigued and entertained.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I'm addicted. my kids even join in on the fun also. I finally found a game that holds my attention. I like the challenges for every level. I love trying the figure out the hidden clues and use them accordingly.  it rocks! even better yet I got the game for free!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book definitely kept me guessing where it was going, but it just felt like it was a lot of work to get you there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Can do a lot of things compared to other games that claim to be free. You don't need to spend extra money to properly play the game.
B00361DR4Q|4.0|This disc is superb visually but disappointing in the audio department.  It was overly bright--like somebody turned up the treble by at least 6 db.  (Was that a microphone nestled discretely in Violetta's cleavage?)  And yes, in case you are wondering, I'm viewing this and listening to it on a high end system.  Still, for $8.99, it's a bargain. I do prefer the Domingo/Stratas version (even with the cuts) and am hoping it will be released someday on blu-ray. Of course, it isn't fair to compare a highly produced movie with a live performance--but Stratas was much more convincing in the role, and of course, the ballet scene in the Domingo/Stratas version may never be equaled.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game so much. I hope that you will like this game as much as I do. It is such a fun game.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Loved every minute! Wish they would have kept the story going one more season. I'm sure many more fans would have supported the show.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this because it mostly sticks to time line of mlp, and the updates are awesome. The game also has the brony community's favorite background ponies, they even have derpy runnin' around under a box! I just love it!
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|Good cast wasted in a boring movie. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson were the most interesting characters but the young leads were totally unengaging.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Keep getting error messages that it cannot load! Love app on my phone - wish it worked on my kindle fire hd!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Every note in this movie was perfect. Hulk steals this movie. The Iron Man and Cap'n America banter was spot on. Destroying New York was great to see in &#34;reel&#34; life after having seen it happen every other month in the comics.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and very good. This game was kinda fustrating for a minute but very good. I look forward to updates
B00COGY2P2|4.0|For the most part I liked the movie, but the best part was seeing lots of views of the Pittsburgh area.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have watched this series on PBS each season and have been pleased with the renewal of the characters and the story.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great follow-up to the first book; this story just keeps getting better. I really can't wait to read the third!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my eight year old daughter loves this game. I even play it with her.she loves seeing all of the little pony's from the show on the app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was really about how Governments, militaries, and citizens react to catastrophic events. In an interview I recall the author saying that this book was inspired by the AIDS epidemic. He wanted to closely examine how a chain of events can allow a virus that is comparatively difficult to catch (requires physical contact, not airborne) to become out of control by poor leadership, ignorance, arrogance, and greed. It was a scathing rebuke and I was riveted. Don't see the movie expecting the book, and don't read the book expecting the movie. They are totally different. I was disappointed that the movie neglected all of the rich lessons on being human that this book contained.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|[[ASIN:B00ABKGG0C Blood Song (A RAVEN'S SHADOW NOVEL)]] I seldom give a book 5 stars but this book deserves nothing less. Vaelin's feelings from a boy to a young man are brilliantly portrayed. The description of the training that the boys endured, the discussion of their faith and that of others - all are so well written. One of the good things is that Ryan does not belabour a point but describes pivotal moments in Vaelin's life & moves on.<br />I am not going to say more except - if you like David Gemmell's books (so sad he is no longer with us) you'll like this.<br />My only complaint? WHEN IS BOOK 2 COMING OUT!!!???
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Since I grew up with the original Wizard of Oz I was anxious to see how this one would play out. I have to say I really enjoyed it and think they did a great job leading into the old version. I'm almost hoping they do a remake of Wizard of Oz now.
006178480X|5.0|With break-neck speed, constant cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter James Rollins takes his Sigma Force once again to exotic and strange (but true)places around the globe to try and save the world from certain disaster!!!  Man I want to hang out with the Sigma Force!  Add in some lessons on time/space theories, quantum mechanics, a little history regarding Attila the Hun and Ghengis Khan~a lost book made from human skin and a relic of St. Thomas (yes, the doubting Saint)and you have an unbelievable tale of adventure!  Oh, there's a little friendship and Love thrown in there too!<br />LOVED IT!
B0053O89XI|3.0|I think this is not the strongest season for a very entertaining show.<br />They leave more plot elements hanging and after the first third of the season it seem a little flat.<br />I realize for a sitcom with a small world, after 5 seasons it's hard to find new life in old relationships but I guess they set the bar pretty high.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|This continues the Clifton story with a good plot and lots of interesting characters. It is easy enjoyable reading , but I find the ending of these books a little let down, but I guess that makes one buy the next one.
B00280LYHS|5.0|When I first started reading Percy Jackson, I had no idea how much I'd love the series.  I was pretty sad when I finished this book, but that only meant that it was the conclusion of a wonderful series.  I love the way they did the battles against Kronos and that Percy didn't end up being the hero (you'll get it once you read the book).  This was definitely the best book in the series and I'm looking forward to reading &#34;The Heros of Olympus&#34; series.  You hit a home run Rick!<br />By Ben  Age:11
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Interesting and opened my eyes to how fascism & communism can slowly sneak in if we don't keep our eyes open. This book also breaks my heart for so many lives that were sacrificed needlessly. If read on a kindle or device, there are pics at end that I didn't find until the end of book.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|They do it with intelligence, paying attention, astute encouragement and intervention as they grow.<br />All of those qualities and more, plus a healthy dose of chutzpah.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Twists and turns, this book is yet another hit from Nicholas Sparks. Real tear jerker as always. Definitely recommend this book!!
B008LH4YYC|5.0|I use this to shut down some of the tasks that automatically start with bootup. Also, some apps after hitting the back button, don't always shut down and continue running...this catches them and you can kill those tasks. Love the ES apps!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow wow wow!!! I was very wary about buying this book, but I am soooo glad I did. At one point, I literally stopped breathing. I was shocked at the events! It is definitely something I would recommend to others. The story between Holder and Sky is full of love and it's heartwarming. Buy it! It's wonderfully written, with little grammar mistakes. I hope there's more!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Got this app...became addicted. Good layout, although you can't request full purchase for sellers...only available for desktop, but I'm one to make my purchases on the computer than an app so that's not an issue for me. Also noticed a lot of times the updates weren't real time with auctions..something to watch for. Also the search and refine bar doesn't allow you to keep refining--you have to refine and go back to the categories to get a more detailed category...if you wanna change it you have to search all then refine from scratch again...sometimes it was a hassle. Either way great app for what it's worth!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Really enjoyed this trilogy. Kept my attention as I read all 3 back to back. Even though I am an adult, I find myself enjoying the YA stories. These are well written and enjoyable, if you are looking for a world to escape in, this one works.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like  the vastness to get many youtube,s different types of  venue,s 72 years. Old and grand kids showed  me how to find and use it have. laugh my posterior off!(:-)
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Kinda reminds me of Galaga and Galaxian from the day, The higher levels can be a challenge. Controls are good and the graphics are great too. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD and would highly recommend to anyone.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I liked the movie but there were more Earthlings shown than Asgardians. I think that more of the folks that live IN Asgard should have been in the movie. Really boring when all you get to see is Odin, his wife, Loki, Thor, Thor's buddies, the guardian and only when there is a ceremony do you see anyone else from Asgard. Were the rest of them? Dead and buried?<br /><br />Also would have liked to have seen Nick Fury's character in the movie. Good to see Agent Coulson but Fury would have been interesting alongside Thor.<br /><br />You got to see more Stone Giants than Asgardians.<br /><br />For all of its faults, Dune was a better story set in a science fiction/fantasy world. There was great character development.<br /><br />Most of the comic book world seems to be dwelling on punch more than story. Frankly I would have paid to see a second movie had they developed the Asgardian culture more.<br /><br />All of the characters were well played - the Viking/Norse style of civilization on Asgard could use a few \\"longboats\\" to liven it up. While the CGI sets were stunning it all starts to look like another video game in space after awhile.<br /><br />That is what made Star Trek so good. People. The objects played to the people and not the other way around.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This is a fun game and kinda addictive. Decent graphics and easy to control. Smash all obstacles, find money, and trade/sale your goods. Got it as the Amazon FAOTD so you can't beat free. Works good and looks good on my Kindle Fire HD. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B004G600A4|3.0|I am not sure what is wrong with the DVD, but it does not work in my blue ray/dvd player. It isn't a blue ray, but the dvd player plays both of any other dvd.  This DVD will not play in this player, but will play in my old regular (non blue ray) dvd player. There is also a glitch in the movie making me think that it is a copy not an original.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I look forward to this shop with my wife, we watch these series after they can be purchased so we can watch then when we want. The walking dead is always fun and this season did not disappoint!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|this movie is really good I hope they continue working because is wonderful the casting and the scenes and overall. I want to see more of this.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|comfortable to hold and use. With arthritis in my hand it makes things alot easier to use and the clip-on top goes right onto my phone case or kindel.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Every song is awesome, just when you think you have found a favorite you hear another one and you like that song even more! Love these guys! So happy for them! Make more music! :)
B0090KZDSK|3.0|didn't get much was left wanting little disappointed because feel was robbed and now have to buy the next. only felt we got half a book.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|Giving this book 3 stars since my comment might be more on the personal taste side.  I could not get into this book at all.  Others may like it, but not for me, could not even finish it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini's books are outstanding!  My favorite was A Thousand Splendid Suns, but And the Mountains Echoed: A Novel is also wonderful.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|This app opens the opportunities to uncountable games and all type of life assistances, your day will now be completed.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great true story and one that let's you experience all the horrorss of war and the many stressful days our service personel had to go through in WWII ....
B006H5120E|5.0|This review only pertains to the stereographic conversion job that Stereo D did on this movie.  Simply astounding! I'm a stereoscopic geek, so my plan was to watch the movie and constantly judge the job the artists did. But after an hour, I had given up, and was simply immersed in the story, which of course is enhanced by the stereoscopic depth (if you disagree with \\"of course 3d is better than 2d\\", then go ahead and skip my review, you cyclops).<br /><br />I only wish J. Cameron had taken the opportunity and George Lucased the old CGI ship shots, and made them more realistic than was possible in 97.  Cause I gotta tell ya, that ship kinda looks like something out of GTA IV on my big LG monitor; pretty dated!
B00BJZJXWG|4.0|The first time I heard Rhye, I was intrigued at the sound they produced. Listened to an NPR All Songs Considered podcast and was pulled-in further. Reminded me of Sadé.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Awesome for grabbing that video from YouTube to show your friends without having to search for it again and again!
B00CHILW64|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.. my husband agrees. Watched it twice . Back to back. Cant believe its A true story. Wow
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Playing this game on my kindle fire hd...really fun game, highly interactive, consistent gameplay, and goals provide a good challenge that can last for hours
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I only applied the paste once in the past two months and I write a lot still it hasn't skipped.
B00BSBXA98|4.0|great history. great show. you must see it. I ususlly prefer live shows but this one is also very good on DVD
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|starts off with a rather depressing view of bipolar person helped by widow and ends with cute couple in love
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I think everyone should play it! You might get frustrated but all you have to do is connect two things that you see. It's not easy nor hard but don't give up!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Band of Horses debut album, Everything All The Time, is timeless and classic.  They crush it from beginning to end.  Listen to \\"First Song\\" bob your head and enjoy.  It's one of my personal favorite album openers, and to come on your debut album makes it even more impressive. At 36 minutes, it plays quick and moves beautifully.<br /><br />I just wanted to review this album out of hope that I reach someone questioning whether or not they should purchase this album.  If that's something you are currently deliberating, please allow me be the voice of reason-- do it!  You will be a better person for it.  Cheers!
B00846REIS|5.0|Very quick to the story line. Great read! Better than 50 shades! I would recommend this to anyone who read fifty. Gideon sounds wonderful!
0783225970|5.0|I love this movie and the rich characters that come to life on the screen. WOW! WHAT A CLASSIC - LOVE
B003UYUP58|4.0|Excellent history of cancer that covers both the human side of the afflicted, the doctors treating patients, and the researchers studying the disease and working on cures. It gets a little technical, but it is well explained and I think it brings one up-to-date.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|What's good? The sound of both the mic preamps and the DAC are very good- though I think the pre-amps better.<br /><br />What's bad? Slippery, undersized knobs, thumps on computer restart.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a great memory game, requiring you to remember numbers and patterns while using them to figure out more clues. It also requires logic and patience. Definitely worth the time!
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|Not what I expected but Franco did a great job as oz, and (spoiler alert) but I just couldn't see Mila as the wicked witch.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great story (books).  I haven't seen the HBO show, but I love the books.  Suspensful, well written, keeps your attention, you don't want to put it down.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|the Plantronics voyager legend charger case is a very good product ,it's straight forward  and very user friendly.it's very simple to use and keeps me form having to do a hard charge on the headset everyday.
0887307876|5.0|I have lived &#34;the Dilbert Principle&#34;. Scott Adams is my hero for bringing these Corporate SNAFU's into the open! laugh my way through almost every company meeting that I am required to attend!! I try to mentor all of my new trainees with the wisdom of this book! It should be required reading for all Management employees! Maybe then they won't take themselves so seriously! God knows that we don't!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really like this game, it's been very addicting. I enjoy playing it, and have a hard time putting it down.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was good read; very simplistic and detail-oriented. I love how Stephen Chbosky really captures the mind of a high school freshman, and was able to really get into the mind of an awkward young fellow. You'd love the main character, and that's what makes up the entire book. I'd recommend this to anyone I know.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Well worth the price. Zero complaints. Bought first season through Amazon as well and will purchase season 3 when it is available.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband and I have become totally addicted to Downton Abbey! We love the depth and diversity of all the characters. The acting is among the best we have seen. We have watched the first three seasons so far and can't wait to watch the next one.  Warning! You won't be able to stop watching!
B009GFEOY8|4.0|Certainly the best Impossible film yet - but I would still advise anyone using it to shield it well directly after exposure. The difference in contrast, sharpness, and color accuracy is massive.<br /><br />Immediately out of the camera, throw it in either the cardboard pack, shield it with your hand, or otherwise keep it safe for about 30 minutes from light. This applies especially in direct sunlight: that orange, washed out look is entirely optional. If you keep it dark, it'll look much more like a 'normal' exposure.<br /><br />Still expensive, but at least it's keeping instant photography (and the awesome old Polaroid cameras) alive!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This little game is fast and addictive. It holds my attention and its hard to put down. Great app. Good price... free.
006178480X|5.0|And, I'm starting it now.  Already capturing my<br />attention and have  to get away to really concentrate<br />on it. But, looks as good as the others.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Haunting and still can't figure how this plays out - would love a sequel.  Yes I reccomend this book to those that like twists and turns to their stories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the game that those cheesy &quot;survivalcraft&quot; or &quot;mindcraft&quot;. It's ridiculous what they think they can do, compared to the way minecraft is popular. This is the ultimate pixel game for all of you that wasn't your own world to create, explore and survive. Whether in survival or creative, what an outdoor amazing experience they got a new update with spawn eggs and water/lava buckets this adds to an awesome game. Thanks mojang!
B004N6369Y|5.0|I usually don't read Danielle Steel but followed a friend's advice and was glad I did.  Loved the book and will start reading some of her other works.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is a cool game it has tons of funny stuff. Use random as an adjective before a noun and that object will transform at certain moments. Or try a portal for monsters to come through (in playground). or, you could try the levels. Whatever you choose, be sure to have fun!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Love this compilation CD of Kelly's big hits. Yes, I already had most of the tracks, but I'm a fan and opted to buy her hits again.
B0046IGOIO|1.0|This sounds like it could've been one of the legendary last shows where the spirit had left the Doors.  Really, if you want to hear the Doors in an awful performance, this is it. I never write reviews this negative but I need to warn Doors fans about this. From minute one they sound exhausted and lifeless. The concert begins with about five minutes of tuning; a reminder of the 'anything goes' era where some bands did not approach live shows with professionalism and discipline; not showing cocern to distinguish a live gig from a rehersal (the Airplane were guilty too at times). This interminable tuning goes on between every song sucking every ounce of spotaneous energy from the show. Morrison's voice not only sounds bad but it sounds like they recorded him with a ten dollar mic from Radio Shack. There's nothing on this that comes close to 'Absolutley Live' or Hollywood Bowl, or Alive she cried, most other Bright midnight releases, and the 'Aquarius shows' (Aquirius being the best live Doors IMO) .  I may be alone here but I loved the Doors from day one and still do but I find this unlistenable. Also: note to the Doors management, you 'are' permitted to edit out minutes of tuuning and BS wasted time from a finished release in order to make it sound better.
B0031R5K7M|5.0|Grest rollicking story in the same genre as Lord of the Rings.  Pity they did such a poor job of the movie.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />During the height of the Cold War in the early '70s, a British In-tel operation is trying to uncover a mole in its ranks who's giving the Soviets some info that's, at least apparently, about as crucial as crucial can be.<br /><br />Although I haven't read the book or seen the original '79 film, I found the whole story and presentation here very engaging. TTSS is one of the few films of its type dealing with some very BIG conflicts yet lacking elements that seem contrived or too much of a stretch. Given close attention, the storyline is lucid enough, has some well-done and believable surprises, and does not just mess with one's head for the sake of it. It's also a very revealing look at the whole cynical business of international spying/intelligence. Fine acting, particularly from Mark Strong, Gary Oldman, David Dencik, and Colin Firth.<br /><br />TTSS is obviously a bit too slow-moving for the fast action crowd. The large cast of characters is also a bit hard to keep track of on first view. Non-British audiences may need the subtitles due to the heavy accents and use of slang in this film. All the same, TTSS should appeal not only to international intrigue aficionados, but to anyone who's ever been in a group situation of any sort that's full of bad politics, everyone suspicious of everyone else, etc.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written. One of the better books I've had the pleasure to read. Recommended by a coworker as one of the best books she'd read. Wouldn't disagree.
B008602KQI|4.0|Interesting film, with some possible implications about the future if our government keeps giving this country away. Keep your powder dry.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great series!  I can't wait for season 4.  I'm re-watching them all until it comes out!
0756407915|5.0|This is a really great book. I would recommend it. I can wait for the next book in the series. I just wish there was more from this universe.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I got this from amazon as the first step in solving a problem with my kindle fire, since it made the situation better I give it a 5 star rating, but didn't solve the problem which is resulting in a new kindle fire, I give amazon a 5 star on their support.
B0089WCKG8|5.0|I'll admit that this was my first DeLillo novel. I'll even admit that I read it after I saw the film. While I've seen some reviews by hardcore fans who say that this was a fairly weak DeLilli book, as a newbie it was fantastic hitching a ride with the self-obsessed, ennui-ridden protagonist for a day.<br /><br />If you're looking for a contemporary novel that sweats existentialism from the most unappealing pores, pick it up and read it. Then watch the movie ;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a very fun game because you make stuff and all but I have one problem the problem is that I cant play with my friend so if anyone knows how to help us please Wright it in your reviews and if you Wright turn on the lan we tried that ot did mot work
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Suspense the way it should always be done- without all the garbage today's movies add. No nudity, no vulgar language, no blood and violence, and yet it still manages to keep your attention, tell a great story, and keep you on the edge of your seat in anticipation.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun and crushes boredom right away. But downloading the new versions is really hard. Overall it's super awesome
B005VPRETE|4.0|Got this for my 6 year old granddaughter.  She likes anything Olivia.  I think she enjoys putting it together.  I have no direct<br /><br />experience myself.  I like that Lego is tryingto get girls involved.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|It's necessary to a tremendous amount of glossing around the over-used &#34;****&#34; word, but still a fun, quick read.  Kinsella writes with a witty flair.
1457514508|5.0|I devoured this 199 page novel in two sittings. I won't go into details as many reviewers have done so already. I will only say that Duncan Whitehead has created a fascinating group of neighbors living near a park in Savannah, Georgia. One of the members of a dog walking group who visit the park regularly, has lost her husband, and jostling among the widows begins for the widower's attentions. But that's only the beginning as the story is told from multiple points of view (men and women) and the reader feasts on the many foibles of human nature--lust, envy, revenge, and every conceivable failing to which people are prone. I particularly enjoyed learning that one of the neighbors had a very (in)famous uncle. A wonderful blend of comedy, suspense, and a well-rounded portrait of the human condition.<br /><br />Mark Rubinstein<br />Author, \\"Mad Dog House\\"
0525952926|5.0|I listened to this book on audio while at work, and it was an absolute pleasure. Follett is one of the most talented writers I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing, and also one of the hardest working. The size and ambition of this novel (not to mention the entire Century Trilogy) would crush nearly any other writer, the task is so Herculean. Yet, he pulls it off with grand aplomb, weaving a tale that is utterly fascinating, connecting each character across the globe with an intricacy so detailed, it simply beggars the mind.<br /><br />The narrator also deserves MAJOR credit for his delivery of Winter of the World. This guy's voice is like smooth honey to the ears, and his reading is flawless. Most impressive of all, he effortlessly glides between an enormous range of varied accents, including British, Welsh, American English, German, and French. This narration really put me into the story, and made it very, very enjoyable for me.<br /><br />Some readers may \\"knock\\" this novel for not being up to the ridiculously high standards set forth in Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. But it is absurd to compare Winter of the World to previous Follett novels. They're all outrageously good, a gift to readers everywhere. To knock this one because it isn't quite as good (debatedly) as some of Follett's other novels is totally bogus. This is a five star book, by any reasonable measure. Its scope is astounding, its tale mesmerizing and heart-wrenching, and its characters will enter your life as if they walk the earth itself, and not just the pages of their story. If you enjoy reading, you must experience Follett's work, and Winter of the World is another fine addition to his impressive resume, firmly securing him as the King of Historical Fiction. (That's an unofficial title- but I believe he deserves it!)
B0068THAGY|4.0|Hard to review without giving away the ending. Sufice it to say I enjoyed the film. Ending could've been done differently, in my opinion, but if you're a fan of the genre, as I am, it won't matter as much.
0553565915|5.0|This book is very educational, especially if someone has passed away and you need to find answers .<br />I would recommend
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It is wonderful.  I missed it when I finished.  It had me crying in the airport when I finished.  Read it if you love dogs.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Thought movie ran on the slow side.  Acting was great.  Subtle humor great  I wish the sound could have surround.  Had to crank volume way up.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This is one rare occasion where my review will literally be short. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is great. Fantastic acting (main and supporting), great direction, easy to follow story, and again just plain GOOD. Part 1 gets a score of<br /><br />5 stars
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed playing, perfect for passing the time. Graphics are great and interesting storyline. Not to challenging, even in the expert mode.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Back when I was much younger, I read a book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I remember thinking to myself on the surface, it did not look like much. But after reading it I came to have a new found fondness, and extreme like to that particular book. Similarly, in 2001 a movie adaptation was made. And I came to love and admire not only the books in the terrific series, but I came to enjoy the movies just as well. Here it is: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2<br /><br />So He who must not be named has taken hold of the elder wand, and for a mere moment, it appears that the bad guys have won. There is tragedy, pain, and unspeakable evil in this story; but there is also in the end, a beautiful and glorious triumph.<br />The story in the movie is just as great as the novel is, so there is really no need to go any further.<br /><br />I will say that very few movies and movie series have made me care about the characters onscreen and in real life. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson brought what was just a children's fantasy novel and made it into one of the best series ever period. When someone says Daniel Radcliffe, the first thing you think of is Harry Potter. When someone says Rupert Grint you immediately think Ron Weasley. And when someone says Emma Watson, You remember the highly intelligent Hermione Granger. The acting in all 8 movies was good but Part 2 is where the acting from everyone is real as it gets. The actors/actresses in these movies are passionate and you feel it all the way throughout.<br /><br />I am sad to see the series end, but at least we know that Harry James Potter will not be forgotten(both onscreen and in book).<br /><br />All this said, there will not be another series or be it franchise quite like Harry Potter. The magic, the emotion, the fantasy, all of it. Amazing, and just plain brilliant.<br /><br />5 Stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game love how much fun it is to play. Very enjoyable.I highly recommend<br />Also very easy and relaxing to play.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I hate horror, but so many people I respect recommended this book that I tried it anyway. It's not horror, it's war stories. I really enjoyed reading it. Unlike other horror I've tried to read I was able to sleep after reading it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|great app for keeping up with mail on the fly.  use it for all my personal communication here and now
B00633W614|1.0|Read other Archer books and enjoyed more than this effort. Found this to be a very predictable read from beginning to end.  .
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I love the game. Great strategic play. Can be a challenge at times but that is what you save consumables for.
B009JBZH54|5.0|He loves all of the Super Hero movies but I must say  Batman is his favorite.  He loved getting these to add to his collection!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I thought the book started off a little slow and I wasn't quite sure I would like reading from the view point of a five year old boy, but the story was definitely worth a read. I really started to get into the story about 60-ish pages in.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have all versions of the game on my PS3 and I have been waiting for this game to finally make it to the mobile market!  Well done and definetly worth the wait.
0812550706|5.0|Amazing book. My favorite of all time. Highly recommend for all audiences. Bought a copy for my sisters birthday and ended up taking hers to have two :)
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|As we all know, 'Olympus Has Fallen' just came out a few months ago, but this film is done very differently and every bit as good as Olympus. W.H.D. has a good cast, great suspense & action, even some hilarious one-liners, everything a summer action flick should have. Tatum stars as John Cale, a police officer who wants to have a better relationship with his daughter and become a Secret Service Agent for President James Sawyer (Foxx) While on tour of the White House, terrorists begin to take over. Cale has been separated from his daughter, Emily. Cale must team up with the President and take back the White House by any means necessary. If you want a good action-packed popcorn flick, I highly recommend WHITE HOUSE DOWN!!!
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Good cast, great actin, good performance.<br />I like the way the movie unfolds.<br />Keeps you guessin`<br />Is the kind of story I enjoy readin`more than watching the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app. I have it on all my devices. Fun way to pass the time, if you like horses.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|This is a very classic Dr. John CD, and brims over with the cool mojo of his unique sounds. 5 star for sure.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter showed me that it was a free app so I got it.<br />I use to wonder what the crazy was about ? Now I know, I caught myself moving in my seat trying to help the birds hit their target, now isn't that funny.
B005KB0SU6|1.0|LA SOMBRA DEL VIENTO,  EL Prisionero del cielo, EL Juego del Angel, son Magistrales. Tienen una Trama tan bien urdida  Que es imposible dejar dejar de leer.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is just amazing you can have hours on entertainment without getting tired of the game everyone can plat this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! You have to solve puzzles in order to get out of the room but everything is logical instead of random crazy stuff that takes dumb luck to figure it out because only the creator has that sort of thinking process.  Each level gets a little more intricate. Highly recommend
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I downloaded this &#34;free&#34; application to my Kindle Fire so my granddaughter could play &#34;fishies&#34; and then got hooked myself.  This is a fun game and I enjoy it.  The graphics are great and it is a nice way to kill time.<br /><br />What I don't enjoy is the fact that if you want to advance in the game you are constantly needing to buy something like a pack of pearls or extra food.  So far I've spent over $20 and the last pack of pearls didn't even show up on my devise.  There is no support for that type of thing so it looks like I am out the $5.<br /><br />I'd rather they charge me for the app and then have the rest be free.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Like the title says - great! Now it's off to the prologue - can't wait! Definitely would recommend the Maze Runner series!
0062255657|5.0|Whenever I begin reading a book by Neil Gaiman, I always think I know where I'm going. Then I read the second paragraph and I realize how fundamentally, overwhelmingly wrong I am. You may think Ocean at the End of the Lane is a book about what a seven-year-old boy experienced one summer. You may be right — a little. It's so, so much more.<br /><br />It was a riveting tale. Gorgeous prose, incredible storytelling, a flawless narrator and a tale that takes you places you never expected. Read it now, then buy a second copy to give to the friend you know will love it. (You won't want to loan your copy. You will be too busy re-reading it.)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it but it gets monotonous after a while. It could use something to make it more interesting. But it is fun.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Whats not to love whether 30 days, 30 years or 100, no matter how long...we will come for you....BELIEVE IT!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this app so much. I first got in on my ds lite for 15$. On my kindle it was only 99&cent;!!! Great app. If you have a good imagination, this is a must need app for you!
1490313370|5.0|I've read a lot of self-help books but this one was different for me. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because I had already been doing many of the things he suggests. Maybe it's because I agree with everything he says. Maybe it's because we're the same age and have experienced similar events. Whatever the reason, this book has turned me on to the great possibilities of life. I'm an idea machine now. And I can't wait for the future and iI'm enjoying the now. Thanks Mr. Altucher.
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|As with most other war games it's hard to control the aiming part otherwise a good overall free game would not pay to play due to aiming issues
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I read fiction to immerse myself in someone else's life. The problem was there were too many characters to even care about any of them. Add to that the fact that the author makes the case in the book for eugenics and I'm rolling my eyes that his socialist is showing. Oh but don't you know letting most of the civilian population die was the ONLY way. Yuck! Making it through this book was painful. I can see why all the Hollywood elitists loved it though.
B00C1S945G|5.0|The viewing experience was really good compared to netflix. You can definitely tell the difference between the org version and HD. Love the HD version.
006114665X|5.0|Christoper Clark has written an important book.<br /><br />It should be read by every citizen and every policy maker.<br /><br />Simply stated: he asks \\"how\\" is was possible that in place in Europe in 1914 the parts were so alligned that the policy makers decided on War in July - August 1914 rather than peace.<br /><br />Clark writes with clarity about Europe and its powers attempting to discern not what writiers and participants later concluded were the causes of the great catastropie but rather looking from the events what the participants perceived and saw and how the structure of European society and politics and international balance and relations, allowed the decision makers to see war as an advantage.<br /><br />As Barbara Tuchman's look at the time of its publication  was a must read - recommended by President Kennedy - so too is Christopher Clark's great new work.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|one of the best thrillers that has came out in awhile. Deserves greatly to be watched. Will surprise you at the end.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This movie bears no resemblance to the James Bond movies of old.  It is another standard violence movie, with the usual violence, special effects, etc.  There is nothing of interest here for anyone except those who are addicted to computer violence games.
1451695195|4.0|A scientist tries to explain what cannot be explained. Great Read, a Heartfelt story of growth and acceptance of the universal oneness.
B004GJIL34|5.0|Hunger is one of the most compelling movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />Amongst the many amazing scenes, Father & Bobby dialogue and the Corridor are probably 2 of the most compelling scenes I have ever witnessed.<br /><br />Kudos to Steve McQueen and his crew for such a fabulous depiction of the human drama that was Bobby Sands and the others who bravely acted to bring the issues to the attention of the public.<br /><br />This film is nothing short of a poignant masterpiece.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have always used Google search as my default search engine on my home PC's and now for my Kindle. It is far better than the others out there, especially BING. When I search I don't want a bunch of pop up ads and that's what BING gives me. Google gives me pertinent choices for my search criteria.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I have watched this movie a bunch of times and enjoy it every time.  It is humorous and delightful and I will watch it again and again.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game. Most of the time I spend using my Kindle is on the endless version. It is my sleep aid.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have enjoyed the portrayal of both characters.  I am hoping that there will be another season available.  I have read a number of Sherlock Holmes books and love them.  So I am critical of any movie/tv series that comes along.  This one has definitely passed muster!
B002N1AF7C|5.0|This type of music is probably not for everyone, but I enjoy it because it is very different and relaxing for me.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This pool is great. I bought it on Thursday and they delivered it on Friday. My 22 month-old daughter was playing in it on Saturday. She loved the sprinkler holes around the pool. She actually enjoyed that more than actually being in the pool itself.<br /><br />I've read that some people were having trouble with inflating the palm tree. I had a similar issue, but when I turned the palm tree leaves down, once the pool was fully inflated, it stood up on it's own. For some reason, when the leaves are turned up, the palm tree falls to the side as if there isn't enough air in the pool.<br /><br />The slide was a bit of a disappointment. My daughter kept getting stuck on the slide. I will try using baby oil next time. Fingers crossed.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great pool for the money. Even my 5-year old goddaughter enjoyed it. Great buy!!!
B006Y5EMHM|5.0|My own working past included 14 years on the Broadway stage (actually...on Broadway shows, off Broadway shows and productions in London's West End - their version of Broadway). When I first heard of the premise of this show; that it would follow a musical from pre-production tasks like getting backing, a director, etc.; and each episode would continue on as a different phase of putting on a production I was thrilled. I had to retire in my late 40s due to a physical disability which not only stopped me from singing but even speaking for extended periods of time. So before this aired it was already bringing up nostalgic memories for me.<br /><br />The casting (in real life for the pilot) consisted of both LA actors and \\"legitimate\\" stage actors, which Steven Spielberg hoped would give the show more of a true-to-life feeling. There were rumors, which turned out to be true, that if the TV show \\"Smash\\" was a smash that the show would be fully fleshed out and might actually run at least in the New York Theater Workshop (yes, it is mentioned in the later episodes of the 2nd season and is a real place...and for those who like \\"inside jokes\\", the manager of the Workshop is played by an actor named Jesse L. Martin. While most people remember him from the late '80s in a recurring role on Ally McBeal (though he had a couple roles on other TV shows before that) or his recurring role in various versions of the TV show Law and Order, the Law and Order character didn't occur until 10 years after in 1999, so he basically had 10 years to fill and stay employed. Now the \\"inside joke\\" - which just means inside knowledge. He decided to when he was unable to find work in TV to try his hand in theater. While he was in NY looking for a role, he got a job as a waiter at a little restaurant as a waiter and met a man named Jonathan Larson, also a waiter and attempting to write a musical.  For those of you who don't know the name Jonathan Larson, that musical he finished and presented to the board of the New York (sometimes called the Manhattan) Theater Workshop, was the person who wrote the musical RENT.<br /><br />While Jonathan didn't write the part specifically for him, he asked Jesse to play a part in the his new musical. The tie in to this whole story is that in the second season of Smash, Jesse comes in as the character of the manager of the Workshop...the very place he did his first musical/play in real life and what launched his career into the Law and Order franchise 10 years later. So he came full circle, from a real life actor who performer at the Workshop to playing the role, almost 20 years later, of the manager of that very place.<br /><br />I had also heard that in the first season there would be 15 songs written just for this new TV show.  It all sounded too good to be true.<br /><br />I have watched the pilot for this show a few times (hooray for Amazon Prime). Of course my favorite number from the first time the show aired was \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\". It has all the feel or any Broadway number I ever heard or performed. And then to have actors like Megan Hilty (a real Broadway actress who was one of the many actresses to play Glinda the good witch from 2005-2008) in the show \\"Wicked\\" who plays Ivy in this TV show and Christian Borle who has been in several Broadway productions and received several nominations (he plays the writer of the show's music on Smash, Tom) was just amazing.<br /><br />The series has been okay but the pilot was by far the best. I am writing this 6-30-13 and the show has finished its second season and is listed currently as going on hiatus however viewership for the second season was much lower than it had been for the first season so there may not be a season 3. I really hope there is and wish they would stick closer to the original idea of presenting it like a real show in production. The second season felt more like a soap opera until the last couple episodes. I won't say what happened in case someone out thereis curious and decides to watch the show. What I will say is the last several episodes of the second season were really well done.<br /><br />So is the pilot worth watching? Absolutely. It felt nostalgic watching it because it really did stay true to the ins and outs, ups and downs of what it is like (including behind the scenes drama that most people will never see or hear about) to be involved in a show in its infancy. I wasn't sure if Katharine McPhee could pull of the part of either her show's character, Karen or if she would even resemble Marilyn Monroe but she held her own even up against seasoned actors.<br /><br />Here's hoping for a third season.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I really liked this story of Ian Flemmings military escapades.  Funny, tongue in cheek sometimes i think. Some of the exploits were probably not likely but interesting. Good read. Good buy. I bought the only other book i could find by the same author. Hope it is as good.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|I watched it with 5 of my friends from the college class of 1969.  Great one liners, and it brought back the memories of those carefree times in college.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Not a lot of book for the money...but a buck well spent. Great convoluted story that keeps you interested and wanting to read more. I like thrillers like this. Chilling! Who's insane now? Great story.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Was initally unsure where it was going, but the writing and story line kept me interested and I really enjoyed it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game for the mind. gets it thinking.....some can be hard but for the most part fun. if you like mind games, you'll like this one!!
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Good retelling of the Jack and the Beanstalk tale. The digital giants and their land of Gargantua is magical, but could be too scary for young children.  All in all, a rollicking good adventure and entertaining action movie with a happily-ever-after ending.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|My friends play LoL all the time. It looks interesting but my laptop is crap so I tried this game cause it looked a bit like LoL.<br />Turns out, this game is amazing! The controls are easy to get used to. The gameplay is tough for beginneers but it will get easier. After several games I went from 0 kills and 9 deaths to 6 kills and 2 deaths.<br />Give this game a try! It's free!
6304696558|5.0|It had been years since I had seen this movie and enjoyed it very much. I think Goldie Hawn did a fantastic job in this movie. I loved the part she played here. I also like Armand Assante very much and it was the first time I had seen him in a movie.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Saw this in the theater when I was six years old.  Still the best superhero movie by far today, even though the effects from then obviously aren't like the effects we have now.  That might even be part of what makes it so good and &#34;classic&#34; now. Basically, what I'm saying is, in my humble opinion....this movie should be required viewing in schools ;-)
B00AEFXEZE|5.0|As a great fan of Richard Gere I cannot say enough about how gorgeous he was in this movie. He played the part of Julian to perfection. I enjoyed seeing Hector Elizondo in it and usually see him in Richard's movies. The murder plot in this movie adds extra drama to the film and makes it more interesting than it just being about his career.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|What can I say!  Love the CD.  Has a great beat, humorous lyrics.<br />I downloaded the CD on my IPod and take the IPod to the gym with me.<br />California Train is a great CD to work out to.
B00578FKVE|4.0|In my opinion the series starts off kind of sluggishly and takes a few episodes to find its stride, but if you stick through it the series becomes pretty good.
1400069289|4.0|Just stumbled upon this book, and I have to say it's a fascinating read!  It opens with some basic neurology, which is very necessary, but it gives great illustrations of how the human mind works.<br /><br />Not exactly a how to type book, but there are great examples of how habit formation works in real life and it's superbly written - a real page turner.
0062225677|3.0|This book was a mediocre comedic take on standard fantasy (sword & sorcery) tropes.  It reminded me of Hitchhiker's Guide but set in a fantasy realm.  I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because of the fact that it was pretty well written and made me chuckle.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|I hadn't realized how dated this movie's production has become thanks to J.J. Abrams.  Still, it is classic Star Trek.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Well worth each hour spent in this world!!! Truly a magnificent ending to this great series! Using Audibles makes it so much more alive. I did have to increase the speed to 4x to get thru much of the battle. The narrator's were really a perfect choice for these books. Enjoy!!
B00A6RCSKC|1.0|I am writing this to draw attention that Amazon says this app is incompatible with my Galaxy Note 10.1.  It is not, unless Amazon's version is different from what is on Google Play.  I attempted to download it here, but was warned it would be incompatible, and knowing how the AppStore app is, I probably wouldn't be able to see it on my Note to download/install.<br /><br />It's a shame that I wasn't able to purchase it here, but I did purchase it from Play, and it's an excellent Tower Defense game.  Very happy to own it.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan, and very much looked forward to Ocean. I cannot explain yet WHY I was so underwhelmed with this story, I just was. I love Stephen King and Maurice Sendak stories, too, and I felt I was revisiting common themes liberally borrowed from The Dark Half and Talisman, among others. I was disappointed in the ending, as well as confused as to whose funeral the narrator was escaping from, and also who his children were. Was it THEIR Funeral? What kind of fugue state is behind the Narrator's visits back to that FARMHOUSE? Sad and melancholy, and perhaps too personal a story to share with others.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|Bruder toys are high-quality; we are never disappointed in their toys.  It has moving parts that satisfy an inquisitive little guy's imagination and takes a fair amount of abuse.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If you are a facebook fanatic, this app is great. Minimal bugs and doesn't typically crash. Occasionally the feed looks a little odd on the Kindle but overall it's good.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|it was great. Anyone know how to access season 4 all of the episodes. I am a student without much money. So free is ideal. Thank you
B001XVD21Y|1.0|We bought this video and were unable to watch it. It kept buffering every few seconds. I wonder what the problem was and can you refund the $2.99 .
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is by far one of my favorite authors. I could not stop reading once I started. Just finished the second book Winter of the World and cannot wait to start the third.
B00002N9ER|4.0|does the job fine it seems,<br />time will tell how it holds up.<br />price is good, except seems like a lot for two pieces of plastic and some screws, but it works and seems there is little competition.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Totally recommend for all dog lovers and who see them as part of the family. Enzo is such an amazing character and you just fall in love with him.
B009MYARIK|4.0|In true Kinsella fashion this book was a hoot from beginning to end. The two main characters Fliss and Lottie are night and day and the book stays true to that throughout. I have read several other reviews but I kind of feel the readers that left negative responses failed to see that the story was indicative of the the characters. It seemed far-fetched because the characters personalities were so extreme. It was interesting to read how far Fliss would go to stay in control and how much Lottie would whine and take no accountability for her actions given their back story of irresponsible parents and the roles in which they became accustomed.<br /><br />All-in-all, it was entertaining and Noah was a pleasant addition....UNDERPANTS!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|So could not put this book down. Read the first book and I just loved how this continued to follow the families I got to know and love from the first book.
B005LAII44|5.0|have all of the Die Hard movies, found this just as exciting with action. Like having it shipped to my door since big box stores over 40 min away!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Game is actually fun but will take some time to learn. Worth to spend 5 minutes time twice a week.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Totally addictive, great free game! Good strategy. on higher levels, nice and easy fun in the becoming. Totally would recommend this game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm in the middle of season 3 and I love it! Great series with superb acting.  I'm so happy Amazon had season 3!  Thank you amazon!
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Works great for my kids so that they could have options to see good versus could be better. Having choices definitively makes things better.
B005CRQ4OW|3.0|Some parts were funny some parts were serious and there were some parts that were disgusting it was a good book
B004DMIIVO|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies and i just love how colorful and creative it is. I would recommend it to anyone
B0041D843M|3.0|The actual results of this study were okay, but could have been shared without taking a whole book to do so.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved the first hand account of our Navy Seal team taking out Osama Bin Laden.  It was good to read about the training that went into the mission along with the years of prep work that goes into the making of our Armed Services team.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I couldn't put the book down, but found the main character (Dad) frustrating in his inability to recognize that his son was deeply disturbed.  The question of &#34;what would you do if your child did this?&#34; was foremost in my mind.  I'm hoping his next book is a little more optimistic in outlook .  Out book club usually doesn't spend too much time in discussion of the book.  This one brought us all to attention.

B00AWFEBDK|4.0|In a fast paced world we tend to forget the real purpose of life and how we are connected to the universe.  This book made me aware of how quickly we move through the world and the many experiences that have both a positive and negative impact on our lives.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am enjoying playing this game now that I have adjusted to playing it on my Kindle Fire.  It is somewhat different from playing it on my computer, but I like it.

B005HSGB6W|5.0|The lingo is strange, but sort of intoxicating. Even though there's so much talk, things never seem to really drag on. Great story.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|Really enjoying the throwback feel to this game.<br />Don't have many friends playing it, so not able to get the full effect of all the features. Still it's been great to pass the time.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Frankly, I was expecting more.<br /><br />This movie suffers from the humdrum of over-familiarity.  There are no surprises, not even when Hugo Weaving rips off his face.  Chris Evans has the look but lacks charisma.  Tommy Lee Jones is uncharacteristically nasty and also a bit of a clich&eacute;.  Many scenes felt like rip-offs of other films (why did this movie begin like The Thing?).  How many times has a movie character been caught kissing the wrong girl (and have it not amount to anything)?  Seriously, riding on the top of a speeding taxi, that's never been done before!  The BLUE LIGHT special wasn't.  It's nice to know a movie can be futuristic and a period piece at the same time and not defy logic or reality.<br />They wasted so much time prepping this movie as a means of introducing the character, destined for other films, that they left out the most intriguing part of his story, the comeback.  He went from one time period (they devoted a full two hours to it), to another time period in the blink of an eye (we even get to see the blink as a long blackout).  That's it.  The end.  Stay tuned.  To be continued.  I'm surprised they didn't use \\"never mind\\" as their postscript.<br /><br />For me, this was a huge letdown.  Their only attribute, Stanley Tucci, was wasted in a small role.  Oh, well, yes, the shield was cool.  That's about it.<br />I'm keeping it only until I decide whether I'll be saving the rest of the of Marvel super heroes series (Iron Man, Lead Bottom, The Heil Hydra Antics, Thorn, The Avengers.........not the better one featuring Mrs. Peel).<br /><br />I console myself with the thought that it could have been a lot worse.

B0026OE2NY|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I hope it makes it to regular TV one day so everyone can enjoy it!
B0052REQLK|3.0|The author (a social researcher) interviewed 1,000 old people, and recounts a subset of about 30 of the most common lessons and advice that he heard from the old people.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a pretty good book. It was well written, and the pace moved along--no tedious dead spots, so it was an easy read. It was fairly interesting to read the many short quotes, stories, and opinions of the old people (kind of like being able to read just the highlights from a lot of good conversations about life).<br /><br />The content seemed reasonable to me, for what the book was supposed to be (a summary of 1,000 old people's opinions). The 30 major lessons are:<br /><br />On Marriage<br />- marry someone a lot like yourself<br />- friendship is as important as romance<br />- don't keep score (50-50 thinking, etc)<br />- talk to each other<br />- commit to marriage itself, not just to your partner<br /><br />On Career:<br />- choose for intrinsic rewards, not for financial ones<br />- keep looking for a job that makes you happy<br />- make the most of a bad job<br />- emotional intelligence trumps every other kind<br />- everyone needs autonomy (in the job)<br /><br />On Parenting:<br />- it's all about time (with the kids)<br />- it's normal to have favorites, but never show it<br />- don't hit your kids<br />- avoid a rift at all costs<br />- take a lifelong view of relationships with kids<br /><br />On Old Age:<br />- being old is much better than you think<br />- act like you'll need your body for 100 years<br />- don't worry about dying (accept that it is nature's way)<br />- stay connected (socially, to people and groups)<br />- plan ahead about where you will live as an old person **very good<br /><br />On Avoiding Regrets:<br />- always be honest<br />- say yes to opportunities<br />- travel more<br />- choose a mate with extreme care<br />- say it now (to people while you and them are still alive)<br /><br />On Living Like an Old Person (an \\"expert\\"):<br/>- time is of the essence (ie, don't waste it)<br />- happiness is a choice, not a condition<br />- time spent worrying is time wasted<br />- think small (focus on small present things vs big future things)<br />- have faith (attend a spiritual or religious group)<br /><br />As you can see for yourself, the lessons seem reasonable (as they generally did to me). However, I had a number of issues with the book, some minor and some major, as described below.<br /><br />First, I didn't like the subtitle or the main premise of the book. \\"30 Lessons for Living - Tried and True Advice from the Wisest Americans.\\" It seemed to me that there was no compelling evidence at all for the claim that \\"old people = wise people\\", or that \\"the people who were interviewed are/were the wisest Americans.\\" But I wonder. What is wise? Does being \\"wise\\" (living the 30 lessons) have a big impact on your life? Is the 30L way the \\"best\\" way to live life?<br /><br />I found the whole premise of the book unconvincing. I think the book would be on much firmer conceptual ground if the author limited himself to a book, title, and premise that simply said \\"I interviewed 1000 old people (where I picked the topic questions), and here's a summary of their most popular answers\\", instead of trying to make the (unconvincing) claims that old=wise, and 30L=\\"wise living.\\"<br /><br />Second, I thought some of the lessons were pretty trite (find a job that you really like), sometimes banal (spend time with your kids; take care of your body), and sometimes unactionable (being old is better than you think). And to me, I was baffled by the complete lack of reference to the importance of education in the 30 lessons.<br /><br />As a young person (in my 20's), I took every opportunity that I had to ask old people (age 50-90) questions similar to this book. I would say \\"You've lived through 1 or 2 world wars, the great depression, the dirty 30's, maybe raised a family, and have had many jobs from farm to city alongthe way, maybe even in different countries. What advice would you have for a young person roughly my age about life, and how to live it?\\" Perhaps I asked 20 or 50 \\"old\\" people this kind of question.<br /><br />The most popular thing they said -- and I emphasize that (1) I heard this advice at least 30% of time, if not more) and (2) that they typically said this advice with EXACTLY the same wording -- was, \\"Get all the education that you can. It doesn't cost you anything to carry it around.\\" Time after time I heard this phrase, from both male and female \\"old\\" people. I found the \\"carry it around\\" idea intriguing, as if that generation had a mindset about needing to move their possessions from place to place.<br /><br />And yet, this book has no mention of the importance of education in it at all, whatsoever (for singles, parents, or their kids). Very strange. It makes me think the book (the interview questions) did not cover a few of the big issues in life (eg. education or money).<br /><br />Third, the book is based on a huge selection/survivorship bias. Just because the old people were lucky enough to be alive to be interviewed doesn't make them wise at all. Their existence could easily be as much lucky genetics versus their 30L living skills. Luck and skill are very different things. [[ASIN:1422184234 The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in Business, Sports, and Investing]]<br /><br />And of course the old people's generation grew up in a very different world, so who is to say that their advice based on the past 80 years is even 100% relevant to the next 80 years of living, let alone being \\"the wisest\\" advice.<br /><br />I think the book should have addressed the HUGE survivorship bias issue. For all we know, the best advice for living resided in the people who died earlier, or those who were not interviewed. Once again, I think the book title and premise overreaches the content. A better title would have been \\"I Interviewed 1000 old people (who were close to the grave) about life; here is what they said.\\"<br /><br />So I think the book has reasonable content, since I think most advice you hear from old people (like I did) is reasonable when considered in the context of their lives and their experiences. Often their advice is even applicable to other people's lives. But I would bet that if you could ask dead people for advice, they would have \\"equivalent\\" good advice too, so being old and interviewed doesn't automatically imply wise or better living to me...<br /><br />I would recommend this book to my friends as a fairly light book of stories and advice from old people (but not as a deep guide to improving your life).<br /><br />Instead, here are a few deeper books that I think do a much better job of giving advice on how to live a happier, more meaningful life and marriage. (Oddly enough, they don't talk much about \\"get all the education that you can; it doesn't cost you anything to carry it around\\" either. Go figure.)<br /><br />On Life:<br />[[ASIN:0465028020 The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]]<br />[[ASIN:0195374614 A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy]]<br />[[ASIN:B004ISLQCQ Optimal Functioning: A Positive Psychology Handbook]]<br />[[ASIN:1478121734 Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It]]<br /><br />On Marriage:<br />[[ASIN:0802473156 The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts]]<br />[[ASIN:B0084PUMY2 By John M.

B002IR3PSC|4.0|Here you have a one hour (approximate) segment made for TV broadcast out of a longer concert by one of several truly great '70s era bands that it is sad that nobody thought to document when they were in their prime. Tull has evolved into a quieter, almost jazzy band today to accommodate Ian's greatly reduced vocal range but at their height they were phenomenal in concert - here you get a good slice of one of their shows on video - the rest of the show is there but only as AUDIO. The video starts somewhere in the middle.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Very Awesome movie. So sad to see how music has now become this perfectly edited and packaged product. Dingo approved
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I must admit, they sound GREAT on this set of discs. After all the feuds and tours with only one or two original members I had pretty much begun to ignore news of new tours, now I wish I'd have seen this - Brian and Mike and the others buried the hatchet and do what they have always done to perfection... that bridge from '50s Doo wop harmonies to Surf Music that they have always owned is here in all its glory. Check it out.

B0060FXBNM|4.0|We enjoy these movies. First one is the best in my opinion, although they are all entertaining, and my son like the last one the best. The price was right for these, and although it is bare bones blu ray, no special features, or any of the extras that usually come with blu ray movies, I'm good with that. My son doesn't care about that anyway, and I appreciate the blu ray picture and sound.
B0012GMVVW|5.0|The Thin White Duke is in great form here - I'm surprised it took me so long to explore this period of his artistry. If you liked Earthling, you'll get into this.
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King has a habit of writing very long books and as a big Stephen King fan, I'm absolutely ok with that.  In fact, Stephen King is one of those rare writers who can hold your interest for 1,000+ pages, he's just THAT good.  My favorite quality about his writing is his ability to develop a character; people who are believable with flaws and fears and doubts, who can still be hero's.  Since this book isn't as long as some of his other works, that may be why the character development wasn't typically Stephen King and I missed that in this book, but the creativity of the story rather made up for that in the end.  My six-word-review would be, &#34;It was a fantastic quick read.&#34;  I cannot WAIT for &#34;Dr. Sleep&#34; to come out in September!
B00CISC2DA|4.0|An enjoyable addition to B of C's catalog. I didn't find it to have broken much in the way of new ground but it holds the ground they have well. If you liked what has come before, then get this.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I bought this book mostly because it was recommended by Ryan Holiday on his reading list.<br /><br />I can say I was NOT disappointed! Full of real life examples, great content, great principles to put into practice. Of course one doesn't agree with everything 100% but it's a great book nonetheless and everyone should come away from reading it with more than a few gems they can practice in their daily life! I recommend it!
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|Pronounced Quaker - Great Icelandic band with their new release. Maybe there is something about those high northern latitudes that lends itself to dark but beautiful music. I have listened to this several times a week since it arrived 2 weeks back. Unique sound - lead guitar is played with a violin bow much of the time. Great for those long darknesses of the winters in the far north.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I like this game but sometimes the colors are too close together and I have a hard time seeing a match.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I just love Castle. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a fun show, and not just some police procedural. It's more Moonlighting than Law and Order.
B009CGGCSC|5.0|Meryl Streep is an excellent actress. Most of the reason for my high rating was because of her acting ability. I have always been a fan of the songs. All the actors and actresses were amazing. Meryl Steeps two friends were so comical. The setting was amazing.

0321525655|3.0|This book has some great ideas for making attractive, memorable PowerPoint presentations, but if you want to read the whole thing in 10 words or less, here it is: simpler is better, less is more, graphics &#62; words.  The one group of people who would definitely benefit from reading this book are engineers who regularly have to deliver presentations to non-engineers.  I love engineers, but I have sat through far too many death-by-PowerPoint sessions with text heavy slides designed by engineers for engineers.  I can say, categorically, that the concepts in this book would have made these presentations infinitely less painful and much more informative.
B008602KQI|2.0|While evolution taught us the survival of the fittest dogma, this movie plays on the gratuitous violence of children killing children as a video game come to life. The killings are part of a nationwide entertainment reality show that has gone really rogue. Disgusting!

B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I was enjoying this game and then there was an &quot;upgrade&quot;. After this I had to wait for it to download every time I wanted to open it.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|Book readers worry when their favorites tomes are translated to the big screen. But WWZ fans should feel fairly good about this film adaptation. The film amps up the speed of the zombies, making them full throttle runners rather than shuffling deadheads, attacking normals like a lioness on a pokey gazelle. That makes them terrifying, as does their ability to scale obstacles by piling atop each other, antlike, until they reach their objective. The book's global reach, with reports coming in from various nations, is handled differently than the book, but manages to cover the US, the Koreas, Israel, India, Crete, Russia and Canada.<br /><br />Brad Pitt really steals the movie. He's a former UN investigator called in to deal with the madness. With his streaming long hair, he's a modern knight errant, living by his passion and wits, bravely going where no soldier or scientist dares. The film is non-stop action after about ten minutes of character development. There are crashes, explosions, screaming, terrified running and close escapes galore. The action drags a little in the last third (mostly due to a lack of zombies) when it swaps sheer terror for tension. Yet, this is still a smart action film, in which (thanks to Angelina, no doubt) the UN and the World Health Organization get major roles.<br /><br />Though rated PG13, WWZ might be a little rough on preteens. I know mine would have had nightmares.

B004KPHQR6|5.0|Loved this movie, I have seen it many times but it always tells a great story. You have to wonder who came up with an idea like timewarping.
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|Roland Emmerich is as it again; and it looks like Washington DC is in peril in White House Down (seriously what does this guy have against DC). The blockbuster is but the second thriller this year to attack the White House as Gerald Butler was defending the President in Olympus Has Fallen. While I have not yet seen Olympus Has Fallen, it did not help White House Down's advertisement as look like that moviegoers have already seen. Yet perhaps White House Down could stand on its own and be an engaging blockbuster. Engaging is not the word I use for White House, but along the lines of stupid. Before jumping into what makes this film tick, here's the synopsis.<br /><br />Channing Tatum plays John Cale, a security guard who wants to join the secret service. After being rejected, Cale finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when terrorist attack the White House.  After the Cale saves President Sayer, played by Jamie Foxx, the two must stop the terrorist attack before they lose the heart of the capital.<br /><br />So what's wrong with White House Down? Well for starter, you can call this movie Die Hard at the White House. It may not look it by seeing the trailers, but this movies has several traits to the 1988 classic, which is not a good thing. The story itself is predictable. Within the first 15 minutes you can figure out how thwe are getting to point a to point b. Does White House Down need a complex plot? No, it doesn't. However, there is one issue that stands in the way of this being enjoyable: the plot is boring.<br /><br />Even the cast is lackluster, despite everyone having decent performances. Channing Tatum's Cale is your standard action hero. While Jamie Foxx is doing his best impersonation of President Obama; which actually from character of President Sawyer.  Everyone else is either flat, underdeveloped or just annoying. Perhaps the only exception is James Woods and even that is not saying much.<br /><br />I wish I could say that the action is worthit. Unfortunately, there is nothing to the action scenes. Most of he film's tense moments have been done before, and there is nothing that stands out. The other major to this film is the humor, and you might be able to chuckle at a few things. However, the biggest joke White House Down has to offer is the movie itself.<br /><br />As blockbuster goes, White House Down is weak. Not even the likes of Channing Tatum or Jamie Foxx can save this film. The movie is your generic action film that borderlines on being a ripoff and just dull to sit through. If want to see film for its stupidity, I say go for it. However, you might just want to wait until the film hits TV before seeing it.
B005HED11Y|5.0|It is fun to watch these in order on Amazon Prime and my Kindle.  You can see the characters develop and the chemistry grow among them.  If you love Star Trek I highly recommend watching this.

B00873GRU4|5.0|I am a huge fan of books like Fahrenheit 451 and 1984; Howey's Wool is in the same vein as those classics and deserves a spot on the shelf next to them. I purchased this book originally because of a friend's recommendation, and I am so glad I did. It is worth way more than the several dollars I paid for it. It is one of few books that I have read recently that I couldn't put down. It is a heart warming tale of a post apocalyptic world that you need to put next on your list of must reads.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Although it started out as a potentially good move, the plot kept twisting into this unbelievable mess. I almost turned it off several times.

He and his wife are obviously perfect for each other; they just need this book to get out of their rut!  My husband and I have already benefited from reading it.  Highly recommended.

B005P1YCNK|5.0|A friend recommended this book and I'm glad I read it. This book touches upon so many facets of life and offers practical advice to help you become a better person. This book let me know that I am on the right path, but that I need to go that extra mile to be extraordinary. I will keep referring back to the book to make sure I'm doing my best. This book gave me hope and helped me to realize that I can reach my goals with deliberate consistent action. There are many lessons in the book I plan to share with the young ladies of my teen girl empowerment program called \\" D.I.V.A. ACADEMY\\" ( [...] ) because the lessons in this book are timeless.  There's so much more I can say, but it would take too long. Purchase your copy today.

B00CO8D3G4|4.0|First let me say that this was my first experience reading anything by James. I was neither a promoter or detractor. After reading Choose Yourself I sway closer to promoter than to detractor. I share a lot of his opinions on the value of education in the US (I am a college professor who teaches Marketing Communications). My dad owns his own business and has for many years. I owned an advertising agency before getting into the Professing Biz. So, I agree 100% with James' view that you have/must make a conscious effort to own your destiny. Where James and I part ways slightly is that although it is true that companies can do more with fewer people and robots are a trend (Amazon warehouses for example) I am not as negative on the future of employment as he is. And, I don't believe that all companies hate their employees. There are great places to work and some not-so-great places and some really dreadful places.<br />Unfortunately, most people (I see this in my students sometimes) grab the first job, thinking that there might not be another offer. So, James does a terrific job in infusing the reader with a belief in themselves. I just wish he didn't make it sound so easy to do. For example his story of Sarah Blakely and Spanx he makes it sound like she had a terrific idea and she got it made 1, 2, 3. He does not mention that she was turned down by every single hosiery company in the US because they did not believe in the idea and it took the daughter of the owner of one of those mills to convince her dad to give her a shot. Or that after she got her product into Neiman-Marcus she called her friends and told them to go buy the product and she refunded them the purchase price. I wish he would have showcased that Choosing Yourself, although the right choice, is not the easy way. In actuality it is often the hardest way and the price can be very high, beyond rejection.<br />Overall, there are many wonderful ideas in this book. It is written from a position of genuine passion. I feel like James wants everyone to get off their butt and take charge of their life. It is a great cause and one I believe everyone should embrace. I liked the book a lot, but loved the author's passion, authenticity. And best of all, unlike other Gurus like Anthony Robbins who are basically out to sell you more stuff, James just wants you to achieve and succeed on ones own terms. A worthwhile read (I read the Kindle version).<br />P.S. I am now a reader of his blog.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|One of the best fantasy/drama shows I have ever seen. Good acting, great costumes, surprises, etc. It is more like watching a feature movie than a TV show.
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|Wow...this is the next logical step after 'Second Life Syndrome', and they really pulled it all together on this one.  Riverside is one of those bands that not a whole lot of people have heard of, but the progressive rock 'culture' folk like me *know* about these guys.  They will probably never be a big deal here in the USA, but will ALWAYS be respected as a band to be reckoned with on the prog rock scene (similar to the 'Flower Kings').  If you really like the sound of classic Floyd, Tool, Dream Theater and the like, give these guys a try.  The 'deluxe' edition has a DVD of one of their concerts from 2008, so you get to know the guys behind the music and hear some earlier stuff...which is mind-blowing.  ADHD is a great Riverside CD, and really is the best thing they have done to date as far as consistency and quality.  Their earlier CD's are awesome, but more on the 'experimental' side.  ADHD has less of that 'abandon', but still has the Riverside awesomeness that keep the fans coming back for more....enjoy it!!!
B00BQQM262|4.0|This is just a fun movie.  Quite frankly I had it on while I was cooking in the kitchen.  It  took  just the right  amount of my attention to enjoy and do my cooking.  I do wish I hadn't wasted my money renting it.  I should have just brought it so I could watch it again; whenever I feel.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|It wont let me have access to books, chapter and verse through the table of contents. It gives an error message saying Amazon Kindle not responding. I've tried to re download but to no avail. I'm so disappointed and don't know what to do.
B00633W614|4.0|I have always been a fan of Jeffry Archer, since I read Cain and Able. This book kept me interested in the Clifton's but I didn't realize it was part of a series when I began reading it , so when it left me hanging at the end, I had to by the sequal. Archer is always a good story teller.
098478280X|5.0|Each page of this book is valuable. Right from the 150 questions to the approach to a technical interview. Gayle is so nice she even tells you how to make a good resume. The insights into how Microsoft, Google interviews really work and how recruiters and interviewers think - was rally valuable to me. I suggested this book to everyone, and I still use it to brush up on my interviewing skills. This book helped me land a Software Engineering job at Microsoft.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This video game is addicting and intensely time consuming, for better or worse.  I'd have given it 4.5 stars, detracting half a star though because so much time must be devoted to accumulating resources as compared with actually fighting battles (that is to say, unless you finally break down and pay real cash to purchase them!)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. it is fun.it keeps me preoccupied. i think this game is fun because its difficult sometimes and I like to get new characters and go to different worlds and more.
B007RS2GNM|4.0|Matthew Broderick in one of his best movie and has a great cast. Mattew Broderick in this movie is funny.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addictive and costs almost no money at all. It is more addictive than playing on the internet.
B000X1CMXO|5.0|One of the best movies that  I have seen as a kid. Jaws two I think was the best. Jaws 3 and 4 were very bad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for all ages who love and care for horses. It has great graphics and many different options for taking care of your horses
B000WV84J6|5.0|Die Hard is Bruce Wills best movie ever. The movie has a great Cast One of the best movies that I have.

B006TF6WAM|5.0|A miserable childhood, a selfish mother who leaves you, a father who doesn't care determines your life even if you find a great friend and a wife, who want to be your mother your lover your everything. But it is never too late to change your karma, you just have to get up from your everyday routine and do something, anything you can, Harold Fry wants to post a letter one day, and while walking to the nearest post box, he remembers his only friend, who he had abandoned, and tries to understand why. Being the son of 2 selfish parents he had learnt in his childhood to stay in silent and unnoticeable to survive. He did it all his life, but staying in silent, never expressing his emotions had caused terrible events in his own family and to the 2 persons who were his everything. His wife and son.<br />Walking out of his comfortable house and life he remembers all the most important events joyful or terrible, he let happen and we learn his life step by step. During his journey he meets the most different people, who he accepts without thinking. His decision to walk to save a friend brings him fame and could bring him fortune. However this is not what he needs. He leaves the benefits to others and continue his journey both inside and outside while he founds salvation and his way back to his life and wife. The story is complete, beautiful, great characters, lovely descriptions of nature, funny dialogues and a lot of unexpected events.
B00103584Y|4.0|Was a lot of fun to watch with all its twists, turns and the games it played with time.  Be sure to watch extra material too withe interviews with director and lead.<br />English dubbing not that good, watched it in German with subtitles
B001OMJGD0|2.0|I saw this despite being warned. I should have heeded. It was worse than I thought it might be. Lesson learned.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love having this on my kindle.  I use it when I have my kindle propped up on the kitchen counter so I can see a video of how to cook something.  I also use it when my kindle is propped up on my bathroom counter and I am watching a video on how to style my hair.  This is such a useful thing to have on my kindle
B0010OIN90|5.0|good look and fun for kids to put together whether they are lego fans or not.<br />if a child is getting into telling time or has been telling time I reccoment it for them.<br /><br />good colors too, some of the other models just had too many colors.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I enjoy doing this in the comfort of my own home and in my own timing and at my own pace.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After the first book in the trilogy, readers are left wanting more and expect the same level of expertise from Suzanne Collins. She doesn't let us down.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I have been batch watching this show for the past few months and will be ready to watch Season 6 in real time in the fall.  There is something so enjoyable about this show.  I started because Nathan Fillion had been on Serenity.  But stayed for everyone else.  Beckett's personal story arc is very compelling as are the stand alone episodes.  The murders are inventive and just challenging enough.  All of the supporting characters are first rate - Javier, Ryan, Mom, Alexis, Lani, the old and new captain.  All I know is that if I am feeling grumpy or not in the mood for something intense like Walking Dead or Breaking Bad, I choose Castle.  Every episode is well worth while and most will make you smile at the end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series! Fantastic plot and very historically accurate. I have really enjoyed all 3 seasons. Can't wait for season 4
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoyed this very much and it was my first Baldacci novel. I read many Mystery novels and it is not uncommon to figure out &#34;who done it&#34; early, but luckily I was unable to do that this time.  I also enjoyed the back stories and the timliness of the story, it was written some time ago, but  it is dealing with some of the headlines we are reading now!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe the cliffhanger ending. I read this book in one day just like the other. Gideon and Eva's story is just so tragic at some points. But they come together in the end.
0425263924|5.0|This book was great  , I want more!!! Loved Gidon and Eve they are great and deserved each other . So very  very hot !!!! The wje series was great hope it doesn't take very long for more of this series I find myself thinking about the book all the time ,
1623420148|4.0|Liked this one a lot. Not as good as Wallbanger by Alice Clayton but better then Losing It by Cora Carmack (for those of you who have read and enjoyed both those books like me.) I liked Drew as a narrator. Getting inside his head was fun, and I imagine very much like a real man-whore feels about things (I happen to know a few man- whores and I may or may not have married a reformed one...) Chances I'll be back to read more in this series or this author? Pretty darn good:)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you occupied and busy for hours. Have a 10 yrs old keeping the brain busy thinking of the next clue. Hope there are more levels to play.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Jumped on the bandwagon late and with some doubt, but I was wrong, such a good show. Often had me laughing, crying, angry, and in awe all in one episode! Couldn't stop watching!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Recommended by a friend.  I loved this book!  Imagining life through the eyes of a dog.  Brilliantly written.  A must read!
B006GLM5EQ|2.0|I heard so much about True Blood that I was really excited to watch season 1 but I was very disappointed.  They seem to have spent so much time on the sex scenes that the acting was second place. It is one step away from porn. I understand it's HBO but they could have invested a little more time into the acting and less about the sex.  It's a great story line but needs stronger leads to carry it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining. Good family show to watch. It provides good insight into how life was during those times, both for the wealthy and poor. Excellent!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I kinda like this game because it's great,but when you play,they give you limited time. I wish that they would give you more. Never less. Good game.
B002COTI64|5.0|I just recently discovered Regina Spektor and i half to say that i love every single song on this album and look forward to buying the others :D
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plain Solitaire is definitely habit forming but can be helpful in calming.  When the TV becomes just noise, I can relax with this game.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Canada. I was led to it by a front page review on the NY Times Book Review section and was held from beginning to end. The characters, settings etc were interesting and a joy to be with.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is really good it has many capturing details ,but it was a very slow read it took me a week to finish the book when it could have taken me only 3-4 days. Otherwise this is a great book for kids at ages 10-16+. One thing that could have been explained and detailed more is the sinking of the ship. Also, Pi should have started to face the tiger towards the start of being on the life boat. One thing that would have made this book better is if Pi wasn't on the life boat for so long. I get that the author wanted to get the real capturing details of being on the boat but the details on building the raft didn't need to be given and the part about the cockroaches did not need to be explained or the rat. This book is really good except for those little things that need to be changed. So hopefully this helped you guys if want to start reading life of Pi.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Her music doesn't even need words.  I can honestly say I completely enjoy listening to this. I really love it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is great for my 5 year old, however we are having a hard time finding friends to add. Now that they've added the friend codes, I hope it makes leveling up in the game a little quicker! Our Friend Code is 3b6d01, PLEASE ADD US! Thank you!
1926778103|5.0|This book is an amazing collection of work by the Legendary Joe Mad. If you liked the game at all you will love this behind the scenes look at the evolution of the game from concept to completion. As always, Amazon was fantastic with their shipping. It may just be where I am located in the country, but almost every shipment I have ever received from Amazon shows up a day earlier than promised.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game is interesting and challenging, but somewhat vague at times. It's definitely addictive. Once you start a room you don't want to quit!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|excellent movie would recommend it to everyone.  Plan to buy more classics as soon as possible to complete my collection.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfer is a cool game to help you get your summer going so just sit back a nd relax.  Dude. Cool game make more peace.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Was able to use it in Scotland so really like it to help pass the time while on the bus.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|This movie has held up to time and is still an amazing film. You will have a blast watching this!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Emma was one of my least favorite Austen novels until I watched this BBC series. Well-written/adapted, perfectly cast, and beautifully filmed. It's a world I'd love to live in.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Can't believe that the sequel was as good as the first movie.  Credit to the actors who can have you totally absorbed just by having a conversation with each other.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This a a fantastic show that captures a very unique time in history.<br /><br />The quality of production is second to none, and the show has restored my belief in public television.
B001NA6096|5.0|Don't know how I missed this movie in the original run but it is fantastic.  The two characters really draw you in from the first moment and never let you go .
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|like omg this is da best hungry shark yet although u can't  escape u can upgrade your shark and u lock other sharks<br /><br />it goes like this:<br /><br />reef shark----&gt;mako-------&gt;hammerhead--------&gt;tigershark------&gt;GR3AT WH!TE
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked this book but not quite as well as the Kite Runner and a Thousand Splendid Suns.  I found it confusing at times although that may because I was reading it on a Kindle and it is hard to go back and look at dates etc.  Good character development but didn't flush out plot lines of some of the minor ones.  I will continue to read anything Hosseini writes as his books tell wonderful stories and have rich characters.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I initially saw this at my cousin's home and loved it.  It is a series that I would love to watch over and over, so I decided to order it.  It is about a time in England during the height of the textile industry.  The acting is superb.  I loved the characters in it.  I have shared it with friends and they have enjoyed it too.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I'm not sure about the need to rate this toy's educational value or durability since most people do keep the holiday Barbies as collectibles but that's fine.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about the all white dress from pictures but she looks great in person. The photos don't do justice to the iridescence or the layering on the dress. I also enjoy that the Barbie is really posed in the box with her arms positioned and everything.<br /><br />The packaging is great and perfect for display even with a nice reindeer on the back. This is a great looking doll for the 25th anniversary.
B0067R0APK|1.0|They took an app that worked and killed it. The map / radar function has not worked since the upgrade. Useless!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One never knows when a show picks up and heads into its second season if it will sustain the good from the first season.  Game of Thrones Season Two not only picks up where Season One left off, but carries us deeper into intrigue and betrayal and mystery and magic.<br /><br />Since so much of this show is based on very believable scenes of a society loosely based in the days of knights and sword-fighting, I was a bit worried about how it would work when they ramped up the magic end of things, but they did very well.  Not only are the special effects very well done, but they are tasteful, as well.<br /><br />The characters remain fascinating, some of whom you grow to love and some of whom you come to hate.  However, no one in this show is perfect and everyone has their part in the \\"game,\\" even if they wished they didn't have to.<br /><br />Tyrion, the \\"half-man\\" definitely comes into his own in this series as he shows that, deep down, he can not only care, but care deeply.  Joffrey, the current king whose backside polishes the Iron Throne is a horrid spoiled, cowardly at heart, and downright nasty little boy...yet the others who are vying for his position turn out to be not much better.  While, Theon realizes that going after what he thought he wanted has serious consequences that he never wanted.  All the while, winter is coming and Snow, up beyond the Wall in the North (beautifully filmed in a bleak, lonely, and ice -covered landscape)comes face to face with the worst nightmares of those of the South.  Oh, and about those dragons...definitely this season has built into it shades of what's to come.<br /><br />Despite the magic that crops up now and again in the plot, this show is very realistic in its portrayal of the best and worst of human nature.  It can be VERY graphic at times for sex (both gay and straight) and violence, so it may not be for all.<br /><br />Can't wait for Season Three!!!!!
B00006LIRI|5.0|This product is worth the money you pay. This music makes a difference in finding the right gift for anyone. You can't go wrong buying this product. It’s a nice product to buy as a gift for someone special or for myself. The CD came in great shape.

B00DGN51O8|1.0|Overall a boring movie.  Predictable and flat. Even the CGI was poor. No wonder this movie lost a 100 million dollars.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|This wasn't the best of the 3 BUT the story as a whole is great.  Can't wait for the 4th part to come out.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This drum was a hit with my then 8 month old grandson the moment it was given to him. His Mom tapped her fingers on it (he'll get the drum stick later) and he immediately knew what to do, and loved it! Although he's had it for only a month now, this drum's apparent quality impressed us from the moment it was removed from the box and examined. As he grows, his appreciation for the different tones will also grow, giving even more value to this one, well priced, purchase. We love it!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|A place where you can learn to take care of horses  and collect coins and diamonds to buy new pastures.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Good action sequences but really is not that great in terms of representing the character from Child's books. Cruise was actually a little better than I expected but just not right for the part. More enigma needed and more imposing physicality needed I think.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|John Green is an absolute genius. Paper Towns is fantastic novel and I would recommend it to everybody even remotely interested in the book, or in works by John Green.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|This controller seemed pretty okay when I first got it, I'm still having difficulties figuring out the wireless capabilities for it. On another note, I can't seem to keep the controller at a constant rate of activation while playing. It occasionally will blink off then on again which hinders more hardcore areas of games when constant movement and action is necessary.<br /><br />Tl;dr- concept is good, but the off and on power becomes bothersome when wired.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you're a horse person, this is very adictive. It's geared more for English riding, but hopefully they'll add Western riding in soon.
B000MYFILK|1.0|How can I write a review when I (thought) I purchased it but then found out it was a VIDEO purchase!  Keep your VIDEO...might as well as I can't even find it!<br /><br />I also ordered A CHOURUS LINE and recieved it in the mail; why couldn't I have recieved ROMAN HOLIDAY in the DVD in the mail?<br /><br />I feel that I was ripped off.
B0010OMXKA|2.0|The CD had, perhaps, less than 1/2 the songs from the performance, and not the one I bought it for.  Considered returning it, but didn't.  Unfortunately you had to purchase the CD and DVD in order to get the CD.  Very disappointing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game a lot! My kids enjoying playing as well and have a blast with it. My only problem is with the Paris Update. I lost EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! All my power-up upgrades, keys, EVERYTHING. We didn't uninstall and reinstall but I lost it all and am very upset with this. Would like everything back but know it's impossible!!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I got thisgame for my newphew and he like the game. Put I had to help him out with then game a lot.
B000VBIGD6|1.0|i have a certain weakness for the so-stupid-it's-funny school of comedy, but there are times when it only gets halfway there, if you get my drift. you know a film is in trouble when it comes billed as a comedy and the only real laugh - the Griswold car getting jammed under a semi's trailer - comes and goes within the first ten minutes.<br />it's hard to say why this one doesn't work as well as the other three. one possibility is the deviation from formula, in that the Griswold family is staying home this time around. another key element is casting, or maybe character conceptions. either way, the film features a few too many actors - Brian Doyle-Murray, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sam MacMurray, Doris Roberts, John Randolph, William Hickey - who specialize in obnoxiousness and are asked to flex just those muscles. to say nothing of that fact that Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis are the least appealing Griswold children ever.<br />and don't EVEN get me started on the truly grotesque signature moment, where the Christmas tree electrocutes the cat. in the first Vacation they could get away with killing the dog because it was an obnoxious, snarling little monster, and it was frankly a relief to be rid of it. this cat, however, is an utter innocent who's only &#34;sin&#34; per se is happening to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. maybe it was just as tasteless to drive off having forgotten that the dog was tied to the back bumper, but at least that was a mercy killing, not a murder.<br />the second-most terminal wound is inflicted by a needless overdose of gross-out &#34;humor.&#34; this duty is mostly that of Randy Quaid's Cousin Eddie and his family. the lower-class feel they displayed sparingly in the first film is here shoved into overdrive. we get jokes about emptying his RV's sewage tank and a dog named &#34;Snots.&#34; personally, i have a limited taste for this kind of &#34;humor&#34; at the best of times. i particularly don't need it for the Yuletide season.<br />the story amidst all this chaos is the typical holiday fare, about learning to appreciate family and the warmth of the &#34;true meaning&#34; of Christmas. the scenes with Chevy Chase and Cousin Eddie's kids can get positively sappy. so basically the goal was to balance irreverence and sentimentality in the tradition of A Christmas Story. to describe the film as falling short of that standard would be like saying &#34;that Hitler fella wasn't very nice, was he?&#34;<br />a few years later there was Vegas Vacation. it wasn't exactly a blockbuster, and there are any number of conditions the would-be experts would cite to explain it's alleged mediocrity. (being episode 4, the time that had elapsed, it being a comedy.) but it was nonetheless a Godsend, because it enabled the franchise to go out on a higher note than the Christmas movie would've been./>the story amidst all this chaos is the typical holiday fare, about learning to appreciate family and the warmth of the &#34;true meaning&#34; of Christmas. the scenes with Chevy Chase and Cousin Eddie's kids can get positively sappy. so basically the goal was to balance irreverence and sentimentality in the tradition of A Christmas Story. to describe the film as falling short of that standard would be like saying &#34;that Hitler fella wasn't very nice, was he?&#34;<br />a few years later there was Vegas Vacation. it wasn't exactly a blockbuster, and there are any number of conditions the would-be experts would cite to explain it's alleged mediocrity.

B00992CF6W|5.0|If you can imagine it, you can build it. I got this for my 7 year old grandson but the 4 yr old builds a world of his own. They play in creative mode only. The worlds save automatically. You can view from several vantage points. When asked for their input, they simply said they love, love, love it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This is a place that I can twitt waith friends and also my family. I just stated to use this.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie. A fun flick--not scary, has some great humor, and a happy ending. Just the way I like movies to be!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is my favorite sci-fi tv show. it is nonstop action, the cast is great, and so are the writers
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie is amazing in all details post Tsunomi in Thailand. It kept you attentive through out the movie. The oldest boy, in this family, played a courageous role.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just as in this previous novels, the author captivates the reader from the very first pages.  I was drawn into the story with his descriptions and narratives from the first chapter.  Every character has their story told from his or her viewpoint. Truly and captivating novel
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I really enjoyed the sets, the costumes, and other artistic aspects of this film. I also liked the supporting cast (China girl was amazing). However, I thought the witches were very underwhelming and Oz was merely adequate. See this film for the spectacle and artistic design, but don't expect to be wowed by the main characters.
B0019I6WDG|4.0|An entertaining movie. Liked the actress.  Will never apply deoderant without thinkging about Pauly Bleaker. Watched the movie for a school project.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|This $29.00 product does what it is supposed to do; Thunderbolt to Firewire.  That said, Apple has a long history of changing connectors and stranding an imbedded base of equipment with no way of connecting the new computer to the existing network or peripherals (two Firewire 800 disks in my case). When a new iMac is purchased from Apple, at a minimum, the buyer should be offered this adaptor for a nothing or perhaps $5.00.  When I started to set-up my new fully loaded 27&#34; iMac I realized not only that my existing external drives would not connect but that there are very few Thunderbolt drives on the market.  Thanks to Amazon Prime the missing link arrived promptly and it works well.  As for Apple it they should move their technology forward but their unwillingness to assist their customer base in the transition is, perhaps, reflected in Apple's dismal 2013 stock performance.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Super for those times when you don't feel like doing anything productive. Ad's that pop up at end of every game are annoying but otherwise it's great.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Very briefly, this is a good album - very enjoyable.<br />But I have to say that Black Gives Way to Blue is possibly one of the best things they've ever done - a surprising statement maybe.<br />But it means that they can do better than this. Come on AIC - you have another classic in you somewhere!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I found this by chance looking for a new Kindle read and was just blown away. It was completely engrossing, disturbing yet beautifully written. One of those books you finish then suffer a mild bout of depression that you will never have the experience of reading it for the first time again.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer does it again with &#34;Man of Steel&#34;.  While the sounds on the first CD captures the movie, the sounds on second disc does a better job of capturing the spirit of Man of Steel -- subtle, smooth, rich, and strong.<br /><br />On a related note, a friend commented &#34;The MoS soundtrack was overloaded.  Batman soundtrack was Hans' better work&#34;.  I was thinking the same after my first viewing of the movie.  However, after listening to the soundtrack (which did not leave my CD player for a week), I realized that the soundtracks are incomparable -- Batman deserved a dark and at time melancholic soundtrack while Man of Steel deserved a more uppity and war-like soundtrack.  So, on both occasions, Hans Zimmer delivered exactly what the movies deserved.<br /><br />Of the album, tracks &#34;Earth&#34; and &#34;Arcade&#34; on the second disk stand out; the former is soft and pleasing and the latter is loud and powerful.
B000B8QG22|5.0|I always loved Robin Williams. I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it first come out. It is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not grow tired of it. There are parts where I am laughing, so I will miss the next joke and the next time I watch I will pick that joke up.  I just feel this is one of the classic movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a dystopia science fiction book. This isn't the lighter \\"Hunger Games\\" variety and it isn't a \\"Road Warrior\\" mutant wasteland. It is a simpler, yet intriguing take on a bleak future. It tells the story of a group of people living in a \\"silo\\" that they can't leave due to the hostile atmosphere outside. The author does a fabulous job telling the story in a way that builds the characters and reveals just enough mystery to keep pulling you in to find out more about their life and situation.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, the story-telling is top notch and the characters are fleshed out and likeable (when they are supposed to be).<br /><br />I'm a fan and will be moving on to the next in the series, \\"Shift\\".
B009EANE3M|4.0|I ended up buying this album based on a snippet of a track which played on a TV advert (Hall of fame).  On first listen this was the only track that I enjoyed, and I was concerned that I had bought a 'dud', but I have been pleasantly surprised over time that this was not the case<br /><br />This is one of those albums that grows on you, the more that you listen to it.  There is a good balance of up beat and slower tracks, and is often the way, the track that I bought the album for is now one of my least favourite.  Never the ess this is a good album but you have to be willing to give it time to grow on you
0380730405|5.0|What is it? A ghost story? A romance? A mystery? Well, it's all of them. Never were the three genres pulled together so cleanly and seamlessly than in Daphne Du Maurier's inimitable opus REBECCA.<br />The fact that the story is written partially in dream and entirely in retrospect is what makes the reader float from page to page in a hypnotic state. Beginning with our protagonist recounting a recent dream, she explains what her life has come to after she and her decidedly older husband are forced to leave their old life behind under unexplained circumstances. Instantly we are drawn into her dream as she walks us gingerly through a long-since-trodden path leading to the abandoned ruins of their estate, Manderley. Leaving us just short of knowing anything about her life, she jumps over to what actually happened to lead up to her dream. Starting as a small, meek girl vacationing in France with her immodest employer, Mrs. Van Hopper, she meets Maxim De Winter, the most talked-about widower among gossipy socialites. They quickly fall in love, get married and he whisks her off to Manderley, the source of his demons; namely, his late wife Rebecca, who appears to our protagonist to have been the perfect lady and the perfect wife until the day she drowned. Feeling overshadowed, she resolves to find out what it was about Rebecca that left Manderley and Maxim in shambles after her death. She doesn't realize that being the new mistress of Manderley automatically makes her an enemy to Rebecca's devoted maid, Mrs. Danvers, who may turn out to be one of the most formidable villains ever printed on paper. The plot continues to confound itself with increasing anxiety on the protagonist's part, Maxim's spiraling depression and dejection, Mrs. Danvers' hateful jealousy, unwanted visitors, and an inquest into what really happened the night Rebecca was lost at sea. And through it all, with Du Maurier's impeccable style, you always know that somehow Rebecca is watching from beyond the grave.<br />What starts out as a glamorous love story turns into a battle with a dead person whose life force hasn't quite given up yet. Though the plot sounds dark, the intensity of the pacing increases at just the right times to keep you interested. The protagonist's development over the course of the novel is inspired. Every word fits perfectly with the rest of them. Du Maurier has woven a beautiful fabric of splendor with this unsurpassable work of literature.<br /><br />In short, READ IT.
B00846REIS|2.0|I gave this book two stars because although it does not have a plot or characters that behave like actual people, the pure soap opera of it kept me turning pages, expecting a payoff that all the drama promised. That didn't happen. Maybe it happens in the sequels. The two main characters fall into instant lust, which turns to instant, once-in-a-lifetime all-consuming love for no apparent reason, which turns into an endless dialogue about how much uncontrollable desire they have to own each other and have sex all the time. Even while they're having it.<br /><br />This is one of those stories where stalking and violent possessiveness = true love. It's very unhealthy and implausible. There are red flags flying all over the place, since they are both survivors of sex abuse, but nothing comes of that, either.<br /><br />He is supposed to be the world's hottest dominant, but she walks all over him and they have 99% pure vanilla sex. There's a lot of it, though, so if your interest is straight porn sex descriptions and porn dialogue without much stakes or story, this is the book.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Understanding exposure, that is how to manage the triad of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO is critical in taking good photographs. Bryan presents how to manage exposure in such an easily understandable way that I finished the book and was inspired to go out and take great photographs!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Best new band.  A excellent album.  I am glad they won the Grammys.  I play this album constantly.  Can't wait for their concert.  A big fan.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Wonderful. Very well written I can't wait to read the next book I wish it had ended with hazel and Frank  meeting annabeth
B007A2O3FO|5.0|This film starring Maggie Smith is a wholesome, family friendly ghost tale. I would put it in the category with A Little Princess, The Secret Garden, and Anne of Green Gables. In this story, the past and present overlap from time to time. The movie has a good moral message about kindness. Basically, a British boy stays with his paternal Grandmother during World War 2 while his mother tries to find his father who is serving in the war. The Oldknown family's ancestral home where he stays is a large manor on grounds that once had an abundance of servants, but now has only one cook and a groundskeeper. Via spontaneous time travel,  the boy encounters the people who lived there and gains a good understanding of his fanily and their ancestral home.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is an amazing game I love how you don't have to try to battle trolls like you do in tap dragon the only bad thing is that I need to keep on spending money to get gems when I want to speed things up but overall great game.
B008JFUMDS|5.0|With detours and diversions, this trip through the illusionist's maze keeps you guessing to the end. I thought it was a fun show. The multigenerational cast gives the movie a good mixture of talents and personalities and the magic tricks are performed with the charismatic style of confident entertainers, and why not, they know the ruse.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun. It sometimes has small glitches and randomly shuts down but overall it is a good game to play.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The writers did a good job of throwing lots of drama and some real changes into the plot.  Unfortunately, I think they backed themselves into a corner a few times and characters had to do some very &#34;untrue to themselves&#34; things to &#34;fix&#34; things.  Although there was some excitement and tragedy, it did not seem to build as well - so I was not invested as I would have like.  I think I could have coughed up the 4th star but with only 13 shows and so much time to work on it, I am just not cutting the writers any slack.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is awesome but I would make the upgrades cheaper.  Other than that it is a great free app. I need one more word to submit my review.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a new take on the zombie story.  The normal story focuses on one group trying to survive.  This gives you a global look at how the zombie's won the early battles and how the world came back.  Great read!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Like it so much, I wanted it as part of my movie collection.  It is a timeless collection of catch phrases.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play this game'  It is easy to learn.  I would recommend it to my friend s and family.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Not a great chess player but I enjoy practicing on this. Keeps me from boredom. Wouldn't have it as an only game but good in concert with others,
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|The Hobbit to me was a bit disappointing. I felt Ian's performance of Gandalf to be too light. All the seriousness of the Lord of the Rings seems to have left some of the actors who were in the LOTR movies and this one. Lord Elrond as well.. (Gandalf: \\"I'm not quite dressed for dinner.\\", Elrond: \\"You never are?\\") I didn't find the attempts at humor to be very humorous. I thought Cate Blanchett was excellent as always. The pacing of the film was a bit slow and disjointed. Too much digital work. The king of the Goblins and Azog were disappointingly full CGI. I feel we lose quite a bit in this translation. I like a fantasy film to be a bit darker more ominous.. to have a sense of doubt and wonder at the world. To see the magic and landscapes that make your mind soar. I didn't feel this movie had that. The rock giants fighting to me was quite boring and looked more like a ride at Islands of adventure theme parks. I thought Bilbo was \\"OK\\". I thought Richard Armitage's performance of Thorin was one of the bright spots. I enjoyed the dwarves quite a bit in this film. I also enjoyed seeing Hobbiton again and frodo. I hope the next installment is better paced and the actors take it a bit more seriously. I know the book was originally a children's novel (i believe) but us older people enjoy a bit more nail biting sequences.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I tried 100 floors but found it at times too hard. just started playing this one but so far I really do like it. it's not simple but not impossible either. I've only done the first four floors but so far I love it. highly recommend.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I liked it. Not quite as good as the first. it had some parts that dragged on a little. But overall good. Lead up to the next one and introduced some good new characters.  Had a lot more of Dudley which is a character that interests me on where she is going good or bad.
B002C949KE|5.0|Predictably Irrational is a very interesting and thought provoking book.<br />Alongside the actual content, the structure is well thought out and the book is very well written.<br />Its humorous anecdotes as well as its intellectual insight make for a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in human nature and the thought process.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|great for all who want to know about character, history and reality<br />Hemingway understands people and Spain extremely well.<br />Please read

B007TVANDM|5.0|My 6 year loves this book. She actually loves the entire series. They are fun books to read. She loves the parts where Pete sings about his shoes. I purchased the Kindle version and we read it often. Worth every penny of the $3.79 I paid.
159463176X|5.0|I swear, Khaled Hosseini could write a biography about Barney (yes the purple dinosaur) and I would probably eat that ish up. He is seriously one of the most gifted writers I have come across. You can tell each sentence is crafted meticulously and they all come together in a beautiful and somewhat heart-wrenching cadence. In this case, the story didn't quite match up to The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Sons (seriously - how could he beat that book??), but it really didn't matter. I just adored this book.<br /><br />The synopsis lets us know that the plot is extremely broad in scope...and even that may be an understatement. Each chapter is narrated by a different character and serves as a kind of short story about that person. It took me a while to remember all the characters, and even longer to get all of their stories straight. So I didn't really understand the flow and character connections until the second half of the book.<br /><br />Almost all the characters have moments as the protagonist of their story as well as the antagonist of another's story, so you are able to see the full scope of each person (the good, the bad, and often times the ugly). And the absolute cherry on top - as the story comes together, your perception of each character shifts to bring you somewhere closer to the truth. Pure magic!
B00797MB0O|2.0|great acting. poor story line. seemed like a reality show. better title: suspended adolescence.  best thing was the (neglected) pomeranian.  would not recommend.
B004AQR29C|2.0|The idea of all these popular action stars working together for the first time in a movie is awesome. Unfortunately, it came 20 years too late! Most of these guys are old, out of shape, and has-been actors/action stars (with some exceptions). The story line is preposterous and the action is not that impressive.<br /><br />Back in the day, I loved these guys and their movies. Now, it is a different story ;(
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's good application that does its job.  I like it and recommend it to everyone.  That's about it nothing else to say
B00AECGQF2|3.0|I bought the game because i wanted to compare it to the last version. I couldn't compare anything because they were exactly the same

B00AEFXE9U|4.0|Just an all around fun movie to watch. Great music too! Its one of those movies you go back to watch over and over
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read this book on vacation, and I, well, can't put it into words. If you're looking for a good read that will \\"leave its mark on you\\", then look no further. The Fault in Our Stars is perfection put into words.
B008J34466|5.0|great music by someone who can actually sing, what can I say, need so many words, if you like Pink you will like this, quick delivery
B000SLP4SE|5.0|This is a very exciting story from start to finish. In all likely hood this is based, if not on a compilation of actual events, at least on events that could actually happen. Sadly, government has become to big and to powerful for one man to take it on like THE SHOOTER did. He wouldn't last a week in the real world. But it makes for a thrilling action-packed movie.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I loved this book however it was a bit short and lacking of a solid plot line any different from the first book. I loved all the detail and character developments. If you enjoyed the first book you will enjoy this one.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I believe this movie was a fair portrayal of events as they related to those accused of conspiring to kill Lincoln. Mary Surratt most likely did not know any of the details of the conspiracy but she probably had a vague idea what the meetings in her home were about. You must remember, the country was  at war, and her sympathies lay with the Southern cause. No self-respecting Southerner would have exposed the plan had they known of it. I thought the movie accurately portrayed the hatred that the North had for the South at the time.
B00723NWJE|5.0|First of all  my collection is almost exclusively classical and soundtracks so for her type of music to make it into my collection is a miracle. The thing I notice about Norah is that she is so varied in her genres and styles. If you come straight from listening to the first two albums, Come Away With Me and Feels Like Home, you won't hear the development in her singing and the sound she achieves. It helps to at least sample her other albums. Secondly, please take some time with each album, each song, if you have the patience. It will almost certainly pay off. I'm not sure you can call any of her songs instant hits, except, of course &#34;Come Away with Me.&#34; But at the same time you can't stop there either.<br /><br />This album is much darker than her previous work. You can hear her growth and maturity in every bar and I really like how she has ventured away from the piano to other instruments.<br /><br />This may be strange advice for a an of someone's music, but if you take this album in small doses, say two or three songs at a time, it may help you digest and appreciate it better.

B0089LOKHG|3.0|The first two books in the series were fantastic reads. I read them in a few days and couldn't wait for the final book to come out. A year later Requiem comes out and I finally have time to read it. The book really grips you like the first two...then the end comes. What the heck was that all about? What a disappointing ending to the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun game but it does move a little slowly.  I like the attitude my horse has on occasion and so far I haven't fallen off!

B008220BLG|5.0|One of the greatest aspects of this movie is that you get monolog from a zombie. My fiance and I watched this movie in the theater on Valentine's Day and loved it!! According to IMDB, it's a twist on Romeo and Juliet. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone even slightly interested in it!!
B00000K2UX|5.0|GREAT CD! List of favorites from the movie, and some extras too. If you are an avid fan of TOP GUN, then this CD is for you!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun. Enjoy playing it and taking care if the horses and it keeps me busy being able to come back to it.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Much better than I expected, right along the lines of Mission Impossible. Good action and story line and a pretty leading lady.
B00A29IQPK|5.0|My 4 yr old LOVES this film.  Mom & Dad love it also...except for one line where a human character, a delivery van driver, calls one of the cat characters 'stupid'.  In our house we (and at preschool) we don't call people or animals 'stupid'.  We mute the film for that line.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What a great read! Better than the series! There are so many details you can't work into the TV medium.

B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love this app. The only thing i dont like about it is that you need to buy the Premium Version (for $10.00)after only a few levels. :(:(:(  I love MAGIC THE GATHERING and i wish you didnt need to buy the Premium Version. At least make the Trial version a little bit longer! Oh well. But still, this is a good app and you should get it!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this book before seeing the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the book.  The movie was not as good as the book though.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I started reading this because I got to the end of Season 3 and couldn't stand the suspense.  The TV series is shockingly faithful to the books, with only a few small departures where two or several incidents were obviously combined to make one scene in the show.  Even more surprisingly, only once so far have I noticed that the books and show differ in any way that actually seems important to the story.  Friends have told me that the books are hard to follow, I haven't found that to be true, but I can see how it could be if you hadn't see the show first.<br /><br />I would say that the books are an excellent compliment to the outstanding show.  Both are great in their own right.
