B001DHXT20|4.0|Good version of the movie though I am not always a fan of wide screen.  Watch it in this mode now and then since we have an LCD TV now.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I read \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" in the late 1990's, and have been hooked on Michael Connelly every since. It's the most loaned copy of any books in my personal library, and he is the first author I recommend to others interested in murder/mystery.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Great movie and wonder sequel to the original.  Hope to see another one come out in this series as they are fun to watch.
B006P96PAO|5.0|THIs movie was awesome i cant stop watching the ending! It is such a moving film I would be so glad to recommend to any body :) &#60;3
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Great movie and excellent dialogue between Holmes and Watson characters.  Good adaptation of how the original books were written that I enjoyed reading when I was younger.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Too awful to watch. I'm wondering if I can get my money back for it, or for the remainder beyond the 30 minutes watched. I watched all of Transformers Dark of the Moon and could not finish this.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This prequel to the classic Alien movie series is a movie is built with an exciting story, consistent with the original Alien movie from decades ago, with very real hard-hitting effects.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|The overall condition and sound was excellent however the Sgt Pepper album was received with a slight scratch that is heard on headphones but not through speakers.  The cover for this album also is permanently warped.  The defect does not warrant a return and is something I can live with since everything else is excellent.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|It's been over a decade since the deftones have been my favorite band. This cd is a great addition to an already incredible catalog. Thanks for the great music guys!
B002QRWJA4|4.0|Just saw Phantom on Broadway a few weeks ago and the vocalist for the phantom was better there than the movie. Everyone else in the movie was fantastic. The movie stayed true but highlighted the &#34;rose&#34; more since they can do close-ups with movies that can't be done on stage. Excellent! I would recommended it strongly.
B005S9ELM6|4.0|Hats off to Ben Affleck for directing and starring in one of the most nail biting, suspenseful, heartwarming movies of the year. In 1979 52 U.S. citizens were captured in the American Embassy in Tehran and held captive for 14 months. Thirty three years later, Ben Affleck directs an exciting suspenseful thrilling movie titled ARGO,focusing on the escape of 6 embassy personnel that fled out the back door of the Embassy Building before Iranians who were pretending to be students over took the Embassy.<br /><br />Ben Affleck who plays the part of CIA agent,Tony Mendez, has been called in by the top dogs of CIA to figure out a plan how to get the 6 out of Iran safely without jeopardizing his life and the life's of the 6 embassy personnel. While CIA attempts to come up with a plan, the 6 embassy personnel find refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador, where they stay safe until help arrives. Tony Mendez come up with a plan to produce a movie in the Middle East called ARGO by flying there himself, bringing false identities to the 6 embassy personnel, claiming they are part of a casting crew for a science fiction movie. When CIA Mendez gets to the Ambassador's house, he asks the 6 to put their trust in him, but they are terrified, fearing for their lives knowing if they were caught escaping they would be killed. After much encouragement on Mendez part, the 6 agree to put their fate in the hands of of the CIA agent. As the 6 quickly, with no time to waste, learn to memorize there new identities, past present and future, the Iranians are realizing that there may be 6 more embassy personnel out there besides the 52 that they knew of. Time is running out and Mendez has to work fast. The day before Mendez is to pick up the 6 and bring them to the airport returning them safely to U.S., CIA officials pull the plug, telling him to get out, that they can't back up the pretend movie idea anymore. Mendez takes it upon himself to show his heroic side and continue to go through with his plan. As he picks up the 6 form the Canadian Ambassadors home, he fled with them to the airport hoping they can get past all the security.<br /><br />The scenes in the movie were very realistic, a 70's look. Hair styles, big rimmed eye glasses, older cars, even a scene of Ted Koppel as a young reporter bringing us first hand news through a console television. The airport scene is thrilling, exciting, had me at the edge of my seat truly not knowing how this would all work out. Would all 7 of them make it? Would some make it and not the rest? Very exciting and thrilling, a must see! I won't tell you the end,...\\"AR----GO\\" see it yourself!!
B002XZOZQA|5.0|If you love great music and dance, this is a MUST!  If you've seen it before, you'll enjoy it again
B008M34INW|4.0|If I could believe that any prison could be that corrupt, this would be 5 stars!<br /><br />There is action, and strong diabolical planning in this movie, worth watching again.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|Quick review: this is a book about the art and science of prediction. It discusses various fields where predictions are essential, and why some of these fields got better and other didn't. Nate talks about baseball, economics, earthquakes, weather, climate change, poker and much more. Nate talks about Kanheman's work on human cognition and irrationalities; about Tetlock's work on how &#34;political experts&#34; are not usually better than a layperson's guess; discusses non-linearities, power laws, dynamic systems and how these things can really make predictions fail if you're not careful and humble enough. And it also harshly criticizes Fisherian statistics and advocates Bayesian statistics. To sum up, this is not a textbook on prediciton, it is a pleasant read about the limitations of humans and statistical methods to predict.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|It's just fun to watch-<br />Not just teeth in neck type of stuff! Horror wasn't really a part of this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game so much FUN and some of the other games made. you should get this app!!! I love it
B006YXTRHY|2.0|I know they think we'll love the two Twi-nerds cavorting on their honeymoon but it really doesn't move the story forward.
0425166805|5.0|This book is one of those books everyone should read. I will say that if you are reading this book its opens your eyes to a lot of ideas you might not have thought of.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|As typical with Pixar, this movie is a strong, original outing.<br /><br />A young warrior princess, Merida, rebels against her family's attempts to arrange a marriage for her.  She journeys into the woods and finds a witch, who allows Merida to cast a spell on her mother (turning her into a giant bear).  Through adventures, and her father attempting to hunt the bear, both Merida and her family realize that allowing each to find their own destiny is best.<br /><br />The visuals, and particularly the scenery and background, are lush and gorgeous.  Pixar continues to push the boundaries of animation and the movie is a treat to watch.  They continue to improve the animation of the animals and the people. And as usual for Pixar, the story is fresh and original, though in this case it feels like a traditional Scottish fairy tale.<br /><br />Highly recommended for families or fans of animation.
0066620996|5.0|This book is extremely worth reading. I read it cover to cover and I still think about what it says in there about success. I loaned it to a friend and never got it back which means I might have to buy it again which would be worth it. Extremely good book to have read and own.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was actually better than all the other ones .I'm only ten and when this came out I told my self to sit down read
B000301YY8|5.0|Like most CDs you wont love every track on this CD (although you might) but the tracks you do like on this CD are worth listening to. Worth buying, especially if your GF likes it.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I've used TeamViewer for some time now to help friends fix computer problems without having to leave my armchair and it it the best free remote control  app out there, hands down. However, I had never had much need for file transfers until I got my Kindle Fire, but after trying several other apps for that, it dawned on me that TeamViewer does an amazing cross-platform job of that! Duh! Now I can sync files for free from PC to Kindle or vice versa, no sweat and no ads. It does require having the app set up on all computers that you want to access, but hey, if you love this app as much as I do, it probably already is.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Its really good but its also depressing when you watch this DVD. He even goes to Cuba which was interesting.
B0020TS5JC|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS WELL MADE AND VERY ENTERTAINING. WE SAW IT ON TV FIRST AND LIKED IT SO WELL, WE ORDERED IT.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I recommend this CD if you like the kind of relaxing music that Norah sings. Very soothing and calming, I liked it a lot.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie is great. I wish they did a better trailer for it. No one had any idea what it was about. Hence the box office flop. It could have been a great trilogy!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I really  enjoyed this novel.I loved the history in it and the characters were wonderful.  Not superficial.  I really missed reading about them when I finished this book.
0061900656|5.0|It's simple, short and easy to understand. my 2 and half year son loves it very  much. Highly recommend it.
B0074V33MK|4.0|Brings back to reality, the struggles that our POW's, any POW's went thru during the War. Jamanese were ruthless, and its hard for any veteran to forget
B0064X7FVE|4.0|My smart phone has a weather app on it, and I like to have it to spot check weather conditions in various cities. I like to have that option on the Kindle Fire HD as well.<br /><br />This app looks close to the app that I have on the smart phone, and works much the same way so it is easy to use.<br /><br />It looks nice and I like the neat way the top portion of the screen shows the sky conditions of the location you are looking up as an instant indication of the weather before you even read the data below.
B006S08RLU|5.0|I just love this movie?... The story and the acting and the music is just perfect for the screen... Just fantastic !
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|i have always enjoyed the series and the talented cast of charactors.  this story line is wonderful. nathan fillion needed acting lessons in this one. the best acting was from the always talented, adam baldwin..the blu ray picture  is the best i've viewed on my old tv.sound from my old bose 321 rocked the action scenes.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|An excellent acting job and funny lines... I'll recommend this movie during this Christmas time for all the family! Kids love it too!
B000005S2Y|4.0|Wow - is this album weird! Vangelis really does some magnificently foreign stuff here. The music is full of mystery and action. It's only two tracks but they're about 15/20 minutes each. Great to shut off the lights and take for a ride...unless you are creeped out easily by otherworldly music. The melodies in the first track can be a little jarring at times (which I love) and really take you places you're sure not to have gone before. I had no idea that Jon Anderson would pop up for the last few minutes of it either!! What a shocking surprise that was...together Anderson and Vangelis muse a segment which Yes fans may associate with the 'Soon' segment of 'The Gates of Delirium'... from the 'Relayer' album. Don't expect the 'Blade Runner' score or 'Chariots of Fire'...but do expect nuances of both! Listeners can enjoy truly trademark elements of late 70's and 80's period Vangelis. All the instrumentation and succinct melodic horse sense that the composers best work wreaks of. But not for the light listener or Vangelis newbies. If you like strange, alien sounding stuff this is for you. And Yes fans. ;)
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|An old classic from the early 2000's, my wife and I enjoyed it very much and is creative and with an excellent story
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's addictive and love playing it while traveling and love the way the cards move just by tapping key which makes it fun
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game. wish coins were of more use especially for energy.  would like better descriptions of tyro. items rewarded that I could refer to. overall. very fun
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Very enjoyable! I always look forward to solving and drawing the next challenge!<br />You and your friends will too! Give it a try....very addicting!
B009FZFONO|5.0|What an outstanding season this has been!  The writers are really keeping those who have read the comics on their toes with the twists in the storyline. The action is almost nonstop and the acting is great!  While I feel the writers have yet to show the Governors true brutality David Morrissey is doing a fantastic job of portraying the character!  I highly recommend this season as well as the entire series!<br /><br />Bryan
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Amazon needs to add English closed captions or subtitles to their English language movies. This movie, led by a talented cast, was very well done.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. When reading his work, there always seem to be surprises along the way. The Racketeer is no exception. It is interesting, thought provoking, creative and, above all, very entertaining. I would highly recommend it!
B002RI9HUM|3.0|Not your usual chick lit. It was unexpected and handled a difficult and often ignored subject with compassion. I enjoyed the characters and felt engaged with their lives
B009VSW15Y|1.0|this app turned the camera on that is already on the Kindle Fire 8.9 4g hd,but the activation of the included camera should have been included in the $499.99 price!  Amazon you owe me a $1.99 credit!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I thought the author should have gone more into detail about his experiences.  He used language only a Doctor could understand.  Hard to read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Would be nice if you could just watch them all without having to wait for the next episode to come out.
B00594XOZU|1.0|this app is not under 18 friendly lots of kids asking adults for nasty pics and sending nasty pics please parents watch your children with this app
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. would like to make it to the cave someday.love the different people you earn with coins.would like more speed.when you jump in the air would like more of the speed guys and coin collections.this is a fun game.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|The movie was well done but a bit over rated and for a younger audience.  It was a fair price and it was a great signal and audio for being streamed over my Roku unit from the Amazon Prime connection I have.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I don't have star and don't want it cuz this is the only show on the network that is worth my time. Spartacus is a new age Rome(HBO). It has everything a series should have. Love, sex, violence.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is a master at mysteries.  I have read all of her novels; liked &#34;Forgotten Garden&#34; best. This new one is right up there with my favorites. Just when you think you have figured out the mystery, she throws an angle you never saw coming.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. About to start the next one. Was expecting a book like the movie &#34;Eyes wide Shut&#34;, but no at all like it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I do find this show difficult to watch due to the content, however I also find it well written and must see TV!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I run this app on my Kindle Fire and it works great.  There are handicap options which allow the user to play with a reduced number of pieces with either player 1, or player two.  It's great for amateur players returning to the game of Chess again.  As I stated in the title of my review the games thinking engine is very intuitive, and there are many levels of game play.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I really enjoyed this bluray edition of Titanic.  It had a lot of extras and provided many hours of entertainment.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|Was installing the Amazon App on my Ipad and accidentally  hit the wrong button and downloaded this movie.<br />Would never order a movie I knew nothing about and didn't want to spend 15 bucks on one that appears to be for young folks. Immediately dashed off an email to Amazon and they graciously removed my order. So giving it a single star is really not fair- could be a great little piece of entertainment but could also be a waste of time. Who knows?
B0086700CM|4.0|this app is a game that can be very fun to play. Play it right and you will have success.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A great book- I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be about druggies trying to find their way through post-college life (I didn't read the description, just went by the title...) and ended up with a pretty interesting mystery. It got a little predictable towards the end, but not enough for me to put it down. I would and have recommended it to friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the best games i have played from the amazon app store. it's a fun game to relax with!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show on TV right now. To be able to have it available to watch at my leisure is great. The price is amazing as well.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Love every song! Would definitely recommend to anyone! Great artist whose produced even greater music, can't wait to hear more music from him.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I really wanted to see this movie when I saw it advertised.  They must have used the funniest parts in the trailer.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I've become hooked on [[ASIN:B009OWH24W Logic Puzzles by Puzzle Baron (for Tablets)]], with grids just like the ones I used to do on paper. Even though my fingers aren't bigger than average, I was having a terrible time marking the little boxes. The best thing about this stylus is that one end is a little smaller than the other, which made it ideal for my puzzles. MOST HIGHLY recommended!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app has a great variety of sounds so I can mix &amp;match depending on the mood I'm in...or want to be in!
B008VBYN80|3.0|still trying to learn everything but love the quests and missions.  It seems to take awhile to get to different kingdom's and can't send gifts though.
B004LRVFX4|5.0|onwe of my favorite lower budget horror films last year which reveals Pinot merely the basic story of Abby--kid vampire with protector--but truly a love story ala Romeo and Juliet for the modern era and horror genre.<br /><br />I loved this film. it reminded me of our vulnerability as a youth, our first crush with non-available peeps, and overcoming of fears at school or in our communities.<br /><br />the young talents are outstanding in their respective roles of Romeo and Juliet. In love and for Owen, till death does he serve.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Loved this game. Played great on the new kindle fire HD.  Interesting pirate ghost love story... (who knew)  Lots of great scenes. Spooky!!  keeps you interested in solving the story. Great graphics!  Lots of hints and skips if you need them.  No glitches or download problems.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Typical Disney, great for preteens, however, not up to par with other Disney/Pixar movies, ie Wallee, Finding Nemo, Little Mermaid etc..
B008KRJWEK|5.0|why does this have to be twenty words anyway this is an awesome game and I really enjoy it so and on more thing people if you don't have moder&ntilde; warfare 3 than you need to go to gamestop and make sure you get black ops.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this book about 6 months ago,  and I can still remember everything because it was so good!  I couldn't put it down.  The idea of living in a completely contained silo is so interesting by itself, but the author held my interest throughout the book!  I highly recommend it, and I read a couple of books a week.
B00A12VW86|5.0|Not as good as UNO, but it's still a great album! Heard it a few times and it's definitively different than UNO.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great game to play. My kids love it. It is a good game to play if you are waiting for something and want time to go by faster,play this game!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun and addictive. Games are unique yet some you can play over and over easily to get more points. Overall, a good app.
B009LK6JS2|1.0|You have to be connected to the internet for this...... junk.  I wanted to use it with my Kindle, only has tail view of plane complete garbage
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Very well written book, fit the star trek characters and story line perfectly, one of david mack's finest books can't wait for the next one!
B004NDJXOO|5.0|This movie like others classic Michael J Foz movies is really fantastic. It's funny and you can watch it any time by your self or with any company.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Watched this years ago and enjoyed it. Now my children can enjoy it.....they loved it!  Great movie for family movie night!
B009VB7QQA|2.0|I didn't like this movie...  It was kind of stupid to me...  Maybe you will like it but I didn't...  No real story to me.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Very good and relaxing listening. she has a beautiful voice nice lyrics . really like the background music just plain good
B00448SE4S|5.0|Greater than expected. I purchased this movie new for my husband and myself. Over the top? Yes. Enjoyable? Yup. Definitely.
B009329Y30|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because of Josh and the creative plot.  Loved the cinematography with beautiful country scenes.  Touching plot involving a child which I exceptionally enjoyed.  Must see at least once :)
B00338QENI|5.0|Seldom does one find a story so well researched, so timely, so sad and so historically important.  Recommended by my daughter and a very close friend of very different professions.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Cute movie, but not quite as good as I had expected from Johnny Depp.  Good for a chuckel, but not a belly laugh.
B006ZN7KMM|3.0|I did not have time to finish the book yet, but after sampling a few stories I think I am going to like it.
B0060D123K|5.0|We watch this every year.  It is a wonderful Christmas tradition for every family.  It wouldn't be Christmas without it!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I have been a chess player for forty years and this is the best program I have found so far.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|I have had this case for 2 months. I really like the case, except for one major problem. The edging around this case is plastic, and has already started to crack and peel around the top edges. Hopefully, they will solve this problem.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Fun movie if you like the whole super hero thing, which I do. After watching this, go back and watch Iron Man 2 and others and you'll notice anew references and people that work their way into this movie.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|I really wanted this sooner but it came at perfect timing. I paid standard shipping on the 15th, it shipped the 16th, and it said it would arrive on the 26th of November or 11th of December after I paid for it (which disappointed me). I would check everyday for this to come on my doorstep and track it too EVERYDAY, because I was to leave on the 21st my birthday to a resort which I wanted to see during the car ride. Maybe an 1hr and a half before we left it came, on my birthday, before we left :D I was so happy!! So happy..tears were falling and when I opened it..wow it was just so perfect. IT COMES WITH:<br />A Subterranean Homesick Blues tiny flip book<br />2 Disc's<br />And a book with dialogue inside of thee interviews<br /><br />I LOVE IT with all my heart.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|If you watch this movie thinking it will be a serious story or serious martial arts action, go elsewhere. There is action and martial arts, yes, and a reasonable story, but the drop-lines and humor are where it's at. If you remember Stallone's movies, Willis' movies, and Schwarzzeneger (sp) movies and their key phrases and you watch this movie with a huge grain of salt, then you will enjoy this movie. I laughed my ass off.
159413586X|2.0|Poor choice of purchase. Came in large print. I am twenty years old and do not and never will need large print.
B0088WGBC8|4.0|The other guy was better than Denzel. Don't remember his name, but the new kid made this movie. Denzel seems to be a one-note act again.
B000TBGEZK|5.0|Favorite Beatles album of all time. To hear it on vinyl finally was to hear the voice of God for the first time.
B0088WK27S|3.0|Gerard Butler rarely fails to deliver, and he did a great job in this movie. You wonder how it all will come to be and the story makes it plausible, not corny.
B003JIM9G8|5.0|I already had a decent idea of this story line from reading about it, but I never actually got to see it done so well. Different voices that took me a little to get used to, but the quality of the story and animation made it easy to look past.
B008EQIK90|5.0|I'd watch this again soon. Great action, thrills, and a good story to boot. I'd keep an eye on the new guy.
B000O98R7A|5.0|An original pressing of the 1973 vinyl? Scratches and all, it's still one of my favorite vinyls of all time.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Terrible movie. Dark and sick (not in a good way).  The budding romance or the great men's bodies did not help this story line.  Pass it over!
0671027344|5.0|If you are in high school, or if you're trying to rekindle your high school days, this is the book to bring all of those memories flooding back.
0345525558|5.0|This is a beautifully written and very touching book.  The characters are wonderfully drawn.  Once I started it, it was difficult to put it down.
0439023521|5.0|Best series since Harry Potter, I think. Not better than Harry Potter, but better than Twilight. Very easy to get absorbed into, and is hard to put down.
B0083I90HU|5.0|I knew I had to read this book, after I saw the movie.  Both were exceptional.  I really didn't want the book to end!  That's the sign of a really good read!
B000002UB2|4.0|For a new product, I expected better playability. That aside, it's The Beatles. I'm going to love it either way.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I'm wondering why the producer chose Christen Stewer. She is not so not Snow White type of girl. Her acting skill is not that impressive either
0930289234|5.0|No words can describe my immense love for this graphic novel. I went into it not knowing anything about comic books or Watchmen or anything besides Batman, and this may just have surpassed my love for the Dark Knight.
B005PV81MS|4.0|We settled in to watch this movie, expecting it to be a bad movie.  We were ready to create drinking games, or throw popcorn, or whatever, so we were expecting it to be /fun/, but ultimately bad.<br /><br />The special effects, the sets, and the cinematography were about what we expected, but something weird happened as we watched it -- it was good.  The more it went on, the better it actually got.  It was funny and charming and ultimately endearing.  We watched it like three times.<br /><br />I really do recommend this movie as a fun, interesting and entertaining movie.
1401216676|5.0|If you're a new Batman fan, this is a great comic book to get you thrown into a whole new world of reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game.. I was really mad when they didn't have temple run for Kindle Fire.. Now they do!(: Thanks Michelle!(:
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Great price for a lot of value. Excellent movie. Great quality. Packaging had some wear and tear but the DVD itself was brand new.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|i bought this for my daughter and she loved the movie, said it was very sweet and romantic and she loves the storyline
1594135851|2.0|Poor choice of purchase. Came in large print. I am twenty years old and do not and never will need large print.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Super cute loved it. Not too cheesy, like some cartoon movies. Great lesson taught in this movie with of course a very happy ending  a lot of comedy in it too that will have adults laughing also.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and watching it during the Christmas season is an annual event.<br />So happy to now own it on Blu-Ray and can't wait to watch it. Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie<br />is comedy at it's best!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I originally got into this show because my husband found it on Netflix. He is a hardcore zombie lover but I am not at all. I really got into the second season because of the relationships between the characters and their struggle for normalcy in a non normal setting. Netflix doesn't have Season 3 yet so we had to stay caught up by turning to Amazon
0446580848|4.0|John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield are members of a joint anti terrorist task force based in New York City. John is an ex NY City police officer, and Kate an active member of the FBI; both  posted to the group. DeMille has written other books involving them and their joint activities in fighting terrorism. They are called into their supervisor's office and asked if they would join with a CIA sponsored operation in Yemen to hunt down and capture an Al Qaeda leader calling himself The Panther. Characteristically John wisecracks his way through this and is reluctant to go but does so to go with his wife who feels that such an operation will enhance her career. John has been in Yemen previously hunting The Panther who is acknowledged to be the mastermind of the attack on the USS Cole and the killing of American sailors some years ago. He does have the need to complete the task of hunting down this murderer and putting finish to the job. Why John and his wife are asked to go and join in with the CIA in the hunt is one of the underlying motives in the plot. This is well developed as events unfold once they arrive in Yemen. Demille reintroduces Paul Brenner (The General's Daughter, Upcountry) and he becomes a part of the team that, under the CIA's aegis, will hunt down and arrest the Panther. A good deal of DeMille's personal opinions about the Arab world and the machinations of the CIA in carrying out it's missions comes through in the book which makes it even more engrossing. One of the highlights is the casting of the Panther as an American born Muslim, raised and educated in the US. We are made to understand his reasons for leaving, hating America and Americans, and developing into a terrorist leader. There is a logic in this that is brought across to the reader and proves, right or wrong, very interesting. The ending is obvious, but  mixed with everyone's conflicting motives does manage to keep the reader following closely. Obviously room is left for future novelsinvolving John and Kate and possibly Paul Brenner.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|The writing in this book is philisophical in parts and contains some pretty rough language and situations.  Mr. Lin who escaped to India from Austrailian Prison gets involved in both the humanitarian and mafia side of life there.  You get the impression that half of the population is involved in some kind of criminal behavior (black market medicine, passports, drugs and bribing of the police).  It's basically a love story and a human development intertwined in survival.  I think that any age could enjoy this look into the underbelly of India.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Lots of fun, fairly easy to learn and you can't beat the price.  I highly recommend this game for everyone.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|fun game. played for hours. good story line. hopefully the sequel will be good. a lot of times the sequels aren't. we'll see.
B000008HZB|5.0|I've always been a fan of Lynne & ELO, they've churned out some mighty great hits over the years. I remember hearing \\"Every Little Thing\\" for the first time and loved it immediately!! I thought it was the entire ELO band..and when i found out it was Lynne, solo, i bought the cassette single, and loved the hit so much, never really thought about buying the Cd! I just recently read some of the reviews about this cd, and sounded so good i had to get it...used of course but in great shape...i have to say that this cd is as good as ANY ELO cd i've heard...i highly recommend this cd to any ELO/Jeff Lynne fan....it's actually almost like listening to the Traveling Wilburys too.. I love anything that Jeff Lynne is musically involved in....he's a great musician! If you're a fan, you definitely will not be disappointed!!
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|Wow brings back such memory's. Digital music is crisp and sounds perfect. I love how you can sit in your living room and  be able to buy and download  instantly is great.
B009FZFONO|1.0|The walking dead is the best new series! Addictive. I can't wait to see what happens next. A must see series.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I Don't like having to see the commercials.  Its really not that fun to play.  Hard to see the difference between the aces and the pile.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|From the trailers, we expected Cowboys & Aliens to be something like Mars Attacks! or Men in Black - gore, but goofy stuff, and a lot of humor.  It was PG-13.  So we came with our young-ish teen.  Perhaps we misread the trailers - what we got wasn't anything like that.  We were a bit unsettled by the very beginning and she - and I - couldn't take the brutality after just a few more minutes.  Nor did we want to try to stick it out.  We went home, very upset.  The rest of our group stayed but were sorry they did - they kept expecting (hoping) it to get better.<br /><br />I'm not a total wimp about movie violence - I love Total Recall (the original) and the Terminator movies.  I've seen the most recent Bond movies and thought they were well done, even when they got brutal, but the aforementioned films were nothing compared to this.  This should have been NC-17.<br /><br />For comparison:  \\"Whale Watcher\\" was also PG-13.  It was sweet and innocuous other than some smoking and maybe a few curse words.<br /><br />In summary:  Cowboys & Aliens is a very disturbing, unfunny movie.  Don't be taken in by the trailers.
B00973DDN2|5.0|For $4?! This album is awesome. I bought it on a whim because it was so cheap and I love it. Lots of anthemic songs and really enjoyable.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is proving to be as engrossing as Follett's first book, Fall of Giants.  He is able to<br />weave wonderful characters into world events and tell a compelling story of the times.  Most interesting is the way he brings different world perspectives to the same events.  As with Fall of Giants, this is a fast read, despite the actual length of the book.  Having read Pillars of the Earth and World Without End previously, I find I'm always sorry to see the story come to and end.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I love the style of diary and newspaper scraps that come together nicely. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a creepy but classing book.
B0054JELS4|5.0|DVDs performed as expected, allowing me to watch NCIS with closed captions (CC) and without commercials. I had purchased a Sony Blu-Ray player hoping to use it to stream Netflix from my computer, but the Blu-Ray player I bought does not support CC. Closed captioning is different from subtitles (like foreign movies have). CC is for people who are hard of hearing, as I am, and need CC to enjoy programs. Many of Netflix's movies have CC available, but It appears from what I've read that the Blu-Ray player you are using also has to support CC and many don't. I cancelled Netflix until I am able to determine which Blu-Ray player to buy. The website [...] lists some possibilities and also says that Xboxes can show movies and DVDs with CC.<br /><br />If you know for sure which makes and models of wireless Blu-Ray players have the CC feature, please post this info as I would like to sign up for Netflix again to get movies.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This is fun family movie.  My kids (5 and 8) love it and can watch it every day if I let them!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love The Big Bang Theory.  Previously bought Seasons 1 - 4.  Season 5 is equally excellent.  Now, if I could only get all (or even some) seasons back -- after loaning them to my daughter & son!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Love it!  This is more of a love story upfront than 50 though, sold you're looking for something similar this may be your best shot.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter, she if a great fan of Rod Stewart.  I also enjoy his singing.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I almost gave this book five stars, but I didn't because I think it will appeal to limited audiences.  If you like backpacking, thru-hiking, outdoor adventure, etc., this is a great book for you.  Also, it will appeal to some people who have simply had a hard time &#34;finding themselves&#34; or who have experienced lifes ups and downs.  Some people just won't be able to relate to it, though.<br /><br />It is a great story, evokes various emotions, and was hard to put down.  Bottome line, I would highly recommend it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is a Christmas gigt for my grandson.  I'm sure he is going to enjoy watching it now and in the future.
B0098VXN2Y|2.0|Seemed to have dragged on forever. Some interesting and humorous pays but mostly trying to stay awake throughou t it.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Loved the plot and story-line with a lot of action. I would recommend if you haven't given it a shot, do so!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|fun even for those of us that can't draw to save our lives so try it you will like it
B004GJDQT8|3.0|it us good to check prices ultimately I almost always end up going to the full site to complete orders or check my account.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I have my iPhone in an Otterbox and this tripod fits way too tight around the phone. The tripod legs don't open wide enough to hold up your phone without toppling over. Don't bother.
B004VRK3ZU|3.0|The book was so much better than movie could ever be. So many things were changed that were just not necesary. I guess that it was okay for what it was. I just enjoyed the book more.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is entertaining and fun. Wish the pop ups were a little less annoying, but overall a fun entertaining app.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|While this may not be for everyone, I absolutely loved it! Quite possibly my favorite movie of the last 10 years! So funny, so well written, well acted and just overall a great movie. Just don't take it too seriously, it's meant to be a sattire!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My ten year old claims it is just a bit too hard to figure out, but the adults like it just fine.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Pleasantly surprised by this movie as I did not know who Captain America was having come from the UK, a good lead in the the Avengers movie
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is nice to choose card options and background options. Easy enough for my 10 year old to play, but still fun for the adults.
B0090O07RS|5.0|This is well worth the upgrade from the old release. The HD transfer looks and sounds fantastic. The extras are interesting and I especially enjoyed the one with Bruce Botnick talking about the missing tracks and how they were able to use some digital ingenuity to include them.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun and addicting. Got the app for my 10 yo daughters kindle and I find my husband stealing it to play this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's hard to admit, but I had a pretty tough time putting this book down once I got into it. Although the melodrama early on can distract from the imaginative post-apocalyptic setting, it was easy to follow the character of Katniss, easier yet to root for her when the challenges piled up. While the overall plot seems to borrow heavily from a couple other sources, Collins makes it her own by incorporating a variety of mature themes without completely abandoning the Young Adult genre. Is it violent? Yes, and sometimes it's difficult to picture a society that so willingly enjoys the brutal deaths of children. Still, the class struggle that exists underneath the plot keeps everything glued together.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I found this book to be a really long and tedious read riddled with minutia.<br />It was a chore to finish it.
B0012DP8A6|1.0|I thought this was a cool movie when I was a kid. I was excited to find it in my adult hood. However once I put it in the DVD player I was greatly disappointed. Horrible acting, predictable story line. :(
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I use an HP touchpad for my business and the charge chord that came with it kept having issues.  I saw  Youtube video that recommended this product and it worked!  It has a little warning that claims the device may not charge as it is not the &#34;proper&#34; charge chord but it charges up the battery just fine anyway
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show makes me laugh, everytime I see it and I tell everyone to watch. Thanks to my Kindle I never miss an episode.
B006FE83U4|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my very favorite movies.  I watch it over and over, never tire of it.  One of the best movies ever!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great movie. One of the best action movies I have seen so far. Would recommend it for every action movie lover.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just learned of this series, and enjoy it so much that I caught up on all 3 seasons in just under a week!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is my very favorite of all her albums so far. Every song is awesome.  I think she is a great roll model for girls of all ages.
055357342X|4.0|I got hooked to the story watching the series on HBO. The book is not like watching it but it's a good alternative. Worth reading but --And I don't mean to spoil things-- there are parts where it can really break your heart.
B0027BVMSY|5.0|long time netflix user, but i loved the interface and fluidity of it better than the netflix interface. movie was not bad.
0307277887|3.0|I LOVED Lindsay's style. I loved the humor and the sarcasm and the cynical tone. I didn't love the story as much. For the first time, the TV version is better than the book. Dexter is kind of meek and even clumsy in the book, while the character we all saw in TV is confident and strong.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use yahoo mail on my computer, so was already familiar with it. This is a really great download program.
B009NPA3Q4|1.0|My friend loves Philip Phillips ever since Idol, me on the other hand never really took to him,I did not like to watch him perform, he always looked like he was in pain when he performed! My friend tried to convert me to his music so I took listen and this album is not for me,I really don,t like his style of music or his voice! sorry carol. I know he has a lot of fans who do enjoy his music and  he has one hit single under his belt. He most probably do very well with this album, and I wish him well.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is indeed a Christmas classic DVD movie. Everyone, with any sense of humor, needs to watch this every Christmas. Then you will realize those crazy family relation you have aren't as bad as you thought!
0345803485|1.0|Wow, where do I start? From an objective view, this book is a mess,  it is repetitive, the plot is dull, and the grammar is embarassing.  The characters are flat and I find tree stumps to be more interesting. After reading it, all I can say is wow, just wow, I am confused as to why so many people love this book, it is nothing more than Twilight fanfiction.<br /><br />Christian Grey seems like he was written and concieved by a group of bored 8th grade girls dreaming of their \\"perfect man\\".  He is tall, handsome, a billioniare, speaks fluent French, comes from a wealthy family and has a large penis.  Anastasia comes off as an idiot, plain and simple, Christian verbally abuses her, belittles her, stalks her and infringes on her personal space all in the name of protecting her(gag).  The repetitive descriptions of Christians beautiful gray eyes, sad gray  eyes, angry gray eyes, perfect body and large penis are drilled into the readers head.  We get it Christian is hot and rich, there is no need to remind us every other page.  The sex scenes are laughable, Anastasia orgasms anytime Christian touches her, more descriptions of Christians large penis and gray eyes, and Anastasias \\"inner goddess\\" makes numerous appearances. I must admit I can kind of see why Anastasia is so smitten by Chrisitan, college prices have skyrocketed and the job market sucks. Anastasia needs some means of paying off all those student loans and sleeping with Christian and being his emotional punching bag may help her financially in the long run.<br /><br />Overall I would not reccommend this book.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is a really neat piano playing program. It is really a neat free download! Easy way to learn to play piano!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series has some of the best writers ever. You never know what's going to happen or to whom it will happen to.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This is a DVD movie I bought for my grand daughter. She really loved it. I'm just not into this kind of movies.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This one is very easy to pick up and play and is very well done. I had picked this up as a free app of the day and would definitely reccomend it at the full purchase price.
B00A3AY134|5.0|It's awesome to hear these new remastered versions of popular songs. The three new tracks are great as well! It's defiantly worth getting this album, by far!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think catching fire was a very good book it is well written with lots of details.  I love catching fire!!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|If you are a fan of superhero genre films this is the one for you!  Great film for everyone in the family (except small children).
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|cute love story. how we all have a partner out there no matter how odd we maybe. lots of great acting.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|I bought this CD as a pick me up for my Mom when she was having a bad week, and she absolutely loves it. It's one of her favorite CDs to listen to in the car. Much more pop style than I had expected from Maroon 5 but she loves it.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie was totally boring and I had no connection to any of the characters. Only interesting thing about it was the special effects for the evil queen.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think it is an awesome game; it is addictive. The only thing I hate is that it always glitches and always makes me force close.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My girlfriend reccomended this book and I'm so glad I read it. There are so many twists and turns- keeps you wanting more.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|If you're looking for a beautiful mobile platformer, or just can't wait for Rayman Legends on the Wii U, you'll want to take a look at Rayman Jungle Run for iOS and Android. Despite lifting some art assets and music from last year's stellar Rayman Origins, Rayman Jungle Run is a new game that has the titular mascot automatically running and simplifies the controls down to one button.    As you progress through the game you learn new abilities that shake up the basic platforming such as flying, wall running, and punching. The controls work surprisingly well and Rayman navigates through the complex levels without frustrating the player. The game encourages players to collect Lums and compete with friends through leaderboards on speed runs.    Currently available for iOS and Android, Rayman Jungle Run is a gorgeous, simplified platformer and an easy recommendation for anybody looking for a richer experience from the auto-run genre.    [...]    [...]
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Very fun game.  I love star wars and honestly thought this was the beginning of the end.  But it turned out to be fun.  Especially since it was free.
1423140605|5.0|I loved everything about this book, and I got a around 40% off on Amazon for it. I love this series. If you are a fan of Rick Riordan, then this master piece is worth buying.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I finished this book in a day! It was a great ending to a great series. I liked it almost as much as Harry Potter!
B008458O3S|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and very challenging. the levels build well on each other and it gets really fun when you make it to the bonus levels. i think this would be an especially good game for kids and teens interested in computes programming.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This colorful fun thinking game is fun for all ages. Many levels are available to keep you coming back for more fun and greater challenge.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have come to expect excellence in Grisham's books, and I was not disappointed in The Racketeer.  This was an edge of your seat, never know what to expect experience.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great Suspense filed thriller. Grisham does it again. I will add another book to my Grisham collection. If you like his other work you will like this one too!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|its an addition to my playlists. makes my running exercise for fun. ill did recommend this to my friends and love ones.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was a pretty good movie! It can be hard these days to make a vampire movie that can make you cringe instead of fall in love and this movie did a fine job!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Awesome documentary. The info and delivery are top knotch. I wish this video were required veiwing for all americans. Very professionally done as well.
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|After a realistic analysis that defines the breadth of job-destruction that machines will ultimately impose in the near future, the solutions proposed amount to little more than an uneasy hymn to entrepreneurism. How many hundreds of million entrepreneurs could possibly emerge from a global economy wreaked by pervasive automation? How many knowledge workers could be trained to create new start-ups and to deal with the realities of bringing a new idea to economic success? And how many new jobs would be created for the masses of displaced workers without such skills? A wholly unrealistic slate of poorly developed resolutions to counter a convincing threat. A very unsatisfying read.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan for as long as I can remember; having all of the original stories in one place is a wonderful way to always have them on hand.
B0042EJD8A|4.0|I purchased this video for my environmental science class as we were learning about nonrenewable energy sources. Being a teacher in PA, I thought it was important for my students to see exactly what is happening in the northern part of the state. The documentary may be a little long for the attention span of a high school student, but I found it gripping and horrifying. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see fracking up close.
B003MU9D0S|4.0|Really fun read with a bunch of good characters living in a complex world doing interesting things. I love the idea of the Necromancers' Bells!
B00633W614|5.0|Couldnot wait to read this sequal. Its a book you just want to keep<br />going and going.  Can't wait to read Best Kept Secret.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|great movie for kids. my family and i watched it 5 times in 2 days. the kids just couldnt get enough. lol.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just a really great read the story is about the culture and bravery of the men who look out for our country on a daily basis,
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|its pretty good for a cheap rental. my husband and i loved it. im hoping they make a second one.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|absolutely amazing!!!  Love it!  We watched the whole season in 3 days!!!  Lots of intrigue, great acting, The very best!!!!!
1932100660|5.0|FORKS OVER KNIVES is a companion film featuring the author.  Read this book, watch the film. Point One: Eliminating meats and dairy from diet practically eliminates heart disease, cancer, diabetes and even signs of aging in the face (if health doesn't motivate you, maybe vanity will).  Point Two: Processed foods, with all the sugar, salt and fat, trigger the same brain circuits as addictive drugs.  Think about these two points.  Consider that the grains fed to cows, if instead fed to people, could instead eliminate human world hunger.  Read the book, it carefully explains the science.  The author had to retire before he could write the book, since his research funding would have been cut off by Big Food, who wants to addict you to their products, not worry about your health.  The federal authorities who set nutrition guidelines receive substantial income from Big Food.  In contrast, the film shows several athletes who are on whole food plant based diets, and they look great!  One is probably in her 70's and recovered from cancer with proper diet (she does Iron Man triathlons).  After reading the book, I stopped eating fish (I had stopped eating meat years ago - why would I want to eat an animal raised in the inhumane cages of Big Food?) - and in about two weeks, I had a lot more energy.  I noticed more restaurants offer vegetarian menus, too!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The picture quality made the movie and the characters too.  I loved the bear scenes.  They were a little intense for my 4 year old daughter.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game with challenging levels. This great game is perfect for when you have a few short minutes to waste
B009D5VNLS|5.0|There is simply nothing bad to say about this movie; the kids were captivated, and it sure made me laugh more than once.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Watched it with my girlfriend. She loved the movie so we decided to rent it and watch it together. It was a very good movie
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Excellent product by FiiO.<br /><br />It's everything I wanted and more. The E17 completely changed my experience listening to music, my headphones finally have that extra kick of bass, and increased detail I've been searching for.
B009CPE424|5.0|This movie is so cute. Way better than the other two. My 4 year old loves to mimic the crazy things they say on the movie. Great family film!
B0064BCNA4|5.0|My baby brother loves it. Everytime I open it and start playing it for him ... He runs and wants to play. : )<br />Great for little kids
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What can I say? It was an incredible movie about honor and courage to be a man to your family.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|Loved it.  Had to see this in time to see The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2.  I'm ready now.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Such a great movie. Must see!<br />This tale will have you laughing and singing. Disney never disappoints. Little girls and boys will enjoy.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Really great cast.  Cute story.  Artfully done and beautiful scenery.  Will have to put this on the &#34;need to own list.&#34;
B000W93CHC|5.0|For Follett lovers - this is Grand!  He takes you to another place - another time - effortlessly.  I had read Pillars of the Earth more years ago than I care to guess - and have always maintained that it was the greatest story I had ever read.  (and I am a voracious reader).  True lovers of Pillars will NOT be disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my kindle for my tablet.  I have given several kindles to my grand kids and they love them
B007HACDLK|5.0|Wow, Vince should add to his credits - prognosticator!  The story is so much of what is missing in the mainstream media's reporting or is that non-reporting!  Oops, I'm getting on my political soapbox....back to the book. Unlike many commentors on this forum I do NOT synopsize the book - I just hate that, don't you? -  Readers of Flynn's books know the way he writes and want to read the story - NOT have another tell them what it is about.  So, that being said, buy the book and find out just what Mitch Rapp is up to his _____ in!  Yahoo, Vince Flynn you are super and I am so wishing there was a Mitch out there somewhere watching out for the USA!  Thank you.
1439196834|4.0|If you're just starting to watch &#34;How I Met Your Mother&#34;, I recommend you wait to buy this book until you've at least finished season 5 or 6.<br /><br />Most - if not all - of these plays are actually on the show, and make great references to the show that you're better off seeing first instead of just reading about.<br /><br />All fans of the show - especially Barney lovers - should read this book at least once.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|the game is fun but I want more characters like derpy or even some background ponies to make things more interesting
B000YHG72E|5.0|I've owned the Elf DVD in the past and it disappeared so I invested in this Blu-ray version. It was a great investment. This disc is full of extras. If you like Elf, you'll love this version of it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creativity!!!!!!!!!  Love how retro/slasher/demonic rolls into the series!  Cannot wait to see how the season ends............. Love it, love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|one of the best games ive played in a while. I love the shake points. :) excellent prizes to win.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|this app is good and the experience was good. I enjoy playing fruit ninja and so does everybody else in my house.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|this game stinks. it never loads and it requires a seventy dollar fee for everything extra. I cant believe the makers of angry birds made this. this game is sooooo stupid. DO NOT GET IT.
145162445X|5.0|I highly recommend this book. An easy way to gauge if you'd like this book is to simply watch the lecture on YouTube. If you like the lecture then you should love this book.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I have everything Norah Jones has done, and this one is my favorite. I love the simplicity of the production, and the mood of the songs. Not sure exactly how to describe, but it's almost like many of them have that \\"psychedelic\\" feel of the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. Can't say enough good things about it.
1451675046|5.0|This book is spectacular. If you think it is only for a younger audience, think again. I have the hardcover edition and I highly recommend it. The illustrations throughout the book are amazing and the message is, well, its just the message. Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|very entertaining! I play this all the time, its so addicting! will continue to play and never get tired! love it!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I was playing on my world, and then my Kindle shut off. When I got back on, my freaking world got deleted. This happened to me TWICE! Fix this and I'll be fine with it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A very good addition to the Angry Bird family! A lot of action, adventure, and puzzle solving any age group will enjoy this game
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Lots of fun!  I just can't put it down. The kids are upset cause they never get to play! I love it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The best of the series so far! All you have to do is add Star Wars to anything and it makes it better but this exceeds expectations!
B001TAJGO6|5.0|This film captures the awkwardness of meeting and getting to know someone, then the pain of the breakup, doing so in a way that no other film ever has.  Genius film-making way ahead of its time, with brilliant acting and a great script.  My favorite quote line:<br />Joel: Is there any risk of brain damage?<br />Howard: Well, technically speaking, the operation IS brain damage....<br />Fun and poignant at the same time - a must-see for anyone who's ever gone through the roller coaster ride of a modern relationship.
0375507256|1.0|I had a hard time understanding how the various stories were connected and what the over all general theme was.  One short was completely unintelligible written in some type of language that gave me a headache trying to read.
B00007AJF8|5.0|OK.  Pitch this movie:<br />This guy accidentally finds a &#34;portal&#34; into the mind of John Malkovich.  Yes, THAT John Malkovich.  You know, the guy in that spy movie.  Anyway, this guy starts selling tickets, and the fun ensues! Oh, sure. There's fun, and drama, and intrigue along the way - we'll figure out that stuff later; but that's the basic concept.  So how's about you lending me, oh say, about ten million dollars to get this thing off the ground?  You will? Awesome!<br />How did this movie get made?  I don't know; but I'm sure glad it did. I don't have an answer for why it couldn't have been Tom Cruise (or anyone else for that matter); but it works out just fine that it's John Malkovich. The characters, while brilliantly played by Keener, Cusack, and Diaz, are not particularly lovable; but then, that's sort of the whole point - how we have a tendency to &#34;use&#34; one another.  Favorite line from the movie (said by Charlie Sheen):<br />&#34;Hot lesbian witches! It's f***ing genius!&#34;<br />I won't try to explain this movie beyond that; but you will enjoy it.  You might say, &#34;wait, what?&#34; a couple of times; but it's a fun ride.  And it's a whole lot more than being John Malcovich. Just sayin'.
B0044E9LW6|3.0|I am so glad that I did not purchase these a couple of months ago because I really thought that these were the complete songs that were at the concerts and I just read another review where I found out they are excerpts (which really sucks) because I want the full shows. I'm taking away 2 stars because of this.<br />I have been over to the Ninj Entertainment Group website and did some searching and I would like to know if either of these shows were recorded on videotape (the technology was not available for dvd in '83 or '87) since the footage is from '83 and '87 respectively, I would love to see this footage on dvd in full length someday if it's not already available. It's only been 2 years since his passing but I'm seeing posters and such for the concerts online and I'd like to know if the concerts were recorded by camera? I see references that this footage might come out later. It's good to have the audio of the shows but seeing the whole performance would be better or should I say fantastic. I was at the final Dallas Texas \\"Texxas Jam\\" show (the dragon was broken) where 80,000 fans showed up in 1987, so this was right after he did these shows and recorded the audio.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my kids have been playing this game for months on xbox and my smartphone, now that it's been made available for the kindle fire, my phone is mine again! My teenage son says the quality is the same.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|I like new twists on classic Christmas stories, it helps avoid &#34;holiday media burnout&#34;. This was a nice take on the North Pole.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|First part is great, gives you wonderful info. In the middle it just peters out, the Core wasn't completely explained, I wanted more information about the \\"heaven\\" part, not the \\"purgatory\\" part. It just sort of stops, leaving you hanging there.  When I was done, I thought, \\"You've got to be kidding me.\\"
1416563156|3.0|you'd be better off spending $100 and getting a replica prop . This is pathetic. It is very cheesy while it does have some cool reproductions of drawings used in the movies ..it looks so fake
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great!No one should hate this game because if some one does it not going to end well.:)<br />I hope we all this great game.;)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I Loved all the books. This one did not disappoint me. It was fast and easy to download from amazon to the ipad.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've been waiting for Tim to write about accelerated learning for a while now.  My brain is xplode :)  in a good way.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Love this CD! Like if you do, too! It was a great mixture of all types of music!<br /><br />Best,<br />Reilly<br /><br />(Like this review  and comment!)
0446343129|5.0|Reasonably priced, arrived on time and in one piece. Really opens your eyes about sugar. I bought it for my daughter so she could see how much sugar she's feeding my garndson! She was startled and now limits his intake off sugar which, is kinda tough because sugar is in a lot of food items.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very useful app, much more than my previous battery app. I love that you can customize the look of it.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Good to have this app! Even have it on my boys tablets. Nice to have, love the free app of the day.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Nice twists and good entertaining read! Always enjoy a Grisham read and this rates as one of his best. Thank you.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Love it! My boys love this and so do I! It's a lot of fun, love how they brought Star Wars and Angry birds together!
B0018OIK0E|5.0|This movie is GREAT! Scary and funny it is a classic. I am not into horror films but I love thi movie.
1118026470|3.0|The information I was hoping to be presented in the book was not. I found it a little light on details.
B004L3AQFG|1.0|I got my finger stuck in a bagel for 27 hours and had to cut it off and didn't get a movie out of it.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This was somewhat helpful but some vital pieces of information were missing.  It's a good start but if this had been my first time publishing on Kindle I would have been too frustrated to finish the project.
B004SDEP38|4.0|Did all that was needed.  Good for 'on the go' small jobs.  For larger projects, there is nothing like a computer, though......
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great reading & an interesting story line & characters.  I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out how it was going to end!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. I am a big Nicholas Spark fan plus the story line is very good. It keeps your attention and gets really exciting toward the end. I felt like I was READING a movie. Get it, you won't be sorry.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading what the people & the trubutes have been through in attempt to protect what thet love & cherish most....this book is FULL of GREAT surprises and action.  One feels as though one is involved with what's happening to the characters, because of the authors BRILLIANT writing & desciption.  Once again....a complete page-turner! Makes me hungry for more!!
B009AMANH4|5.0|By now, we've come to expect any performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is going to be incredible. The time and effort the man puts into his roles is remarkable. Mix in one of the best supporting casts you can think of and you're bound to have one of the best movies of the year. Such is the case with Lincoln.<br /><br />Day-Lewis transcends any expectations you may have about his performance, so much so that the man you're watching on screen IS Abraham Lincoln. He is truly a joy to watch and captures the essence of the iconic figure so well. A huge hand has to be given to Steven Spielberg, who delivers his best film in quite a while. The attention to detail is impeccable, the cinematography is outstanding and the supporting cast is terrific.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An AWESOME continuation of the Hunger Games that seriously left me craving MORE about what was going to happen next and what twist/torture the Capitol would contort to control the paeople and the tributes with next.  again....a real page-turner for me!
1856697061|3.0|Very nice photos and cool design ideas, but I found them a bit difficult to interpret. Like some others have mentioned, some don't seem very wearable.
B009CPJHY4|1.0|I'd heard good reviews; however, the movie was quite disappointing. The cast is exceptional, and some good development goes on with the characters, but the plot left my wife and I feeling like we had wasted our evening afterward. The overall message of the film is likewise subpar--something like elderly hedonism, where everything turns out your way. The line repeated over and over in the film is SPOILER something like, &#34;Everything works out in the end. You know its not the end if everything hasn't worked out yet.&#34; Disappointing.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|But this is coming from someone that loved the books but thinks the movies thus far have been really cheesy...from poor acting, directing, and the special effects. Anyway, this one is better but still with many cheesy moments.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|my expectations in this super good processor works way too well, has a very good performance I recommend to players
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Essentially watching the movie Wanted mixed with brutal story & history adapting to the time period.  Obviously directed by same guy obviously, premise had some cool moments, thank goodness only spent $1.99!!!
B009AMAM9S|5.0|Have you ever felt hammered by a movie? Has it ever taken you days, weeks,<br />to integrate a movie, in your head and heart? Read on ...<br /><br />If you see this movie, you'll probably see why some people don't like it. In<br />fact you may see different reasons for different people. A great movie allows<br />the individual to bring their own positive interpretation. Cloud Atlas also<br />allows the individual to bring their own negatives.<br /><br />My own personal bitterness was \\"How come my heros always die, but your heros<br />always live happily ever after?\\" This hit me hardest as I was walking out of<br />the theater, but it still galls me to think about it.<br /><br />You see, its like this: Cloud Atlas goes for power and effect. If they hit<br />something positive in you, you rave about it. If they hit something negative,<br />you hurt big time. This movie isn't about entertainment, its about achieving<br />enough kinetic force to shake you up. Its wrenching. And some people do not<br />like being shaken like a rag doll. More so, because as people have said,<br />Cloud Atlas is unlike any other movie ever made.<br /><br />In a broader sense, I think almost everyone has at least one scene where you<br />ask yourself \\"Do I really wanna sit here and watch this?\\" The whole diversity<br />thing, not just diversity of people, but diversity of fates, gets close to the<br />point of overload with Cloud Atlas, and anyone who feels pushed over the redline<br />will walk out, having better things to do.<br /><br />Again, its like this: If you can hold the movie at arms length, you're ok, but<br />if you step inside it, then its really disturbing. And I'm not talking about<br />the sex and violence either. Its the ideas, plural. There are so many ideas in<br />this movie, at so many different levels, its like a living fractal. Not ideas<br />just for the sake of ideas, not ideas just to shake you up, but ideas that<br />speak to you as a unique individual.<br /><br />For me, Cloud Atlas is the most disturbing movie since Donnie Darko, although<br />they are radically different movies. But then again, some of it is funny, and<br />parts of it are exhilarating too. It has a mix of light and dark, it isn't all<br />dark. And it isn't \\"comic relief\\" either. Somehow, the lighter parts of the<br />movie are woven directly into the fabric of the story. It works amazingly well.<br /><br />In technique, Cloud Atlas takes the concept of an ensemble movie, and re-invents<br />the entire purpose and effect of having an ensemble. And it isn't just in how<br />the actors are related, and who plays what role. One of the foundations of a<br />conventional movie is to build an association in our minds, between 1 actor and<br />the 1 role they play. Cloud Atlas demolishes that foundation and replaces it<br />with its own unique creation. Its disorienting, to such a degree that you can't<br />grasp it from other people's words. You have to experience it for yourself to<br />appreciate the *power* of it.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is also a film that has a voice, in particular on the subject of<br />artificial life. This topic has been around for many decades in science fiction<br />books and movies. But as technology seems to get closer to actually creating<br />it, fiction has gotten more sophisticated in how it expresses its message about<br />artificial life. That message is the most disturbing part of Cloud Atlas for me.<br />The writers see a storm coming, a new kind of storm that no one has ever seen<br />before.<br /><br />I'm not talking about things like the Terminater and SkyNet. Cloud Atlas doesn't<br />deal with machines, it deals with souls. Sure, Cloud Atlas is fiction. But our<br />past is not fiction. We have an ugly history of repeating our mistakes. And some<br />mistakes only become fatal after they've been repeated over and over and over<br />again.<br /><br />Regarding the \\"everyone's connected\\" philosophy, I thought this works great<br />as a narrative device, without me feeling (today at least) that I personally<br />subscribe to that philosophy. I would hope this philosophy doesn't deter<br />anyone from seeing the movie, because I think they turn it into a positive<br />thing, even for people who don't agree with it. Its part of how the story<br />is built, and built very well.<br /><br />Another area where Cloud Atlas pushes the envelope is in taking all the actors<br />and doing radical, (sometimes humorous) make-overs to fit them into a character.<br />This itself has offended some people, because Cloud Atlas doesn't apply any<br />limitations at all, and it has dozens of makeovers. This is very different than,<br />for instance, Looper, where the make-up and acting are all focused with<br />overwhelming skill into changing 1 single person into another single person,<br />with absolute conviction. In Cloud Atlas, the transformations are beautiful,<br />striking, uncanny, other-worldly. It becomes another way in which this movie<br />hammers at you.<br /><br />If you decide, like me, that Cloud Atlas is indeed a masterpiece, you will<br />probably have one moment, one scene, which pushes you over the edge and into<br />the realization that it *is* a masterpiece. Not necessarily the most powerful<br />scene in the movie, but the scene where the sum of it all finally overloads<br />your doubts.<br /><br />For me, that scene was where we first see Doona Bae as Tilda. I've never seen<br />anything like that in a movie, and it took me about 15 seconds to just begin<br />to parse what I was seeing. The sheer creativity, the imaginative beauty of<br />the character, connecting outwards into 2 hours of the vast scope of the movie,<br />just blew me away. Truly, a masterpiece.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Set in the early 70's, at a time when Rock Music was under drastic changes, Almost Famous gives the viewer a sense of the climate during this time period.  Also, one can relate in many ways to the vast array of characters in the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book! Kept me up for 4 nights in a row!!  I highly recommend this book!  Worth the stress of reading it and keeping me awake.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham strings you along in this latest page turner. I love how he always has a trick up his sleeve to keep you reading to the very last page. Can't wait for his next book!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this deeply personal story to be uplifting, hopeful and deeply credible. Some parts of the account were hard to understand, and that adds to the probability that it is a sharing of deep truths. We have nearly no frame of reference to relate to Dr. Alexander's experience, so it is hard to grasp. Even so, the account is deeply engaging and very worthwhile. I recommend it unreservedly.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Good flic. The kids and I enjoyed it. So did their friends and mine. Recommend this movie to everyone. This is a great buy.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I loved studying history ever since grade school. To get an insider's viewpoint in a concise and interesting way Doris K. Goodwin writes is wonderful.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Good flic. The kids and I enjoyed it. So did their friends and mine. Recommend this movie to everyone. This is a great buy.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Just when you think Harry Hole has finally gotten his act together, and his life, he reverts to character.  A good story, though, and not Harry's usual criminal type.  Plenty of plot twists to keep you guessing.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Very Good flic. The beautiful fiance and I enjoyed it. So did the friends. Recommend this movie to everyone. This is a great buy.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|If you like the John Corey character, you'll like this book.  It does not, however, have the same level of suspense as some of DeMille's earlier books.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Good flic. The kids and I enjoyed it. So did their friends and mine. Recommend this movie to everyone. This is a great buy.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|LIfetime Star Wars fan here, and this game is a blast. I've been playing Angry Birds since the beginning and really like how it has evolved. I particularly enjoy how they have combined the terrestrial and space versions of the game into Star Wars. Also the way they've incorporated the characters and their various abilities (the force, using blasters, etc) is just great. Kudos to Rovio for developing something fresh and new twice in a row (first Space, now this).<br /><br />The main complaint I have about the price is that they have a free version for handheld, so $2.99 comes off as highway robbery (I got it for my Kindle Fire).  I also don't like the fact that there is a level you can unlock by paying another $1.99. Apparently you can unlock this by getting 3 stars on every single level. So there's something to strive for. But I'm just not that gifted (in the countless hours I've toiled away on Angry Birds, I've NEVER gotten three stars on each level) so will have to pay to play at some point. But, in all fairness, the game is really fantastic and I'm sure part of that price is to pay for the rights to use the Star Wars content.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Good flic. The kids and I enjoyed it. So did their friends and mine. Recommend this movie to everyone. This is a great buy.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is a prime example of a movie that knows exactly what it is doesn't try to be anything more than that.
0670023329|5.0|\\"Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West\\" by Blaine Harden - a shocking life story of Shin Dong-hyuk - the first escapee from a totally controlled forced-labor camp who made it out of North Korea, the evolution of his soul and the perception of people and the world.<br />The book describes nightmares of inhuman treatment of human slaves in North Korea. It's not somebody's sick fantasy - it's genocide in its reality that is going on near us.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|A must see for Batman fans.  No one writes Batman like the incredible Frann Miller and this one is no exception!  Can't wait for part 2.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find myself addicted to Pinderest. Anything I'm interested in I can find. Great recipes, craft ideas and decorating ideas.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Good movie for all ages, will tug at your heart strings.<br />Lots of action and adventure. A good story with a wonderful ending.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I was a little disappointed with Fall of Giants. The characters were a little hard to follow at times and the politics got boring at times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not the type of shows I like to watch, but after watching just one episode I got hooked.  Excellent performances and very captivating subject.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|This is an alright kids movie but it's an Adult story, written at a young age reading level, adapted into a kids movie with no I dunno, substance.  So a great idea but watered down with each incarnation.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Jonathan Antoine's voice has a quality that hits a chord with me and has from the first time I saw him on Britain's Got Talent. Charlotte is nowhere near the singer he is, but her voice is angelic and pure, and it is a nice complement to his rich tenor.  As this young man develops (he's only 17), I can see him receiving the acclaim of one of the greatest tenors of all time. At this point his voice just tugs at my heartstrings, and his semi-dependency on his friend Charlotte to get him up on the stage is a winning story.  How many other talents are out there in the world but lacking the confidence to stand up and sing out?
B0018ODR20|4.0|I love Hilary's performance!　Her Mort is so fresh!　But I also think I want to listen her Mozart　after she is aged. I may think she will make her own Mozart!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This was a surprisingly VERY cute movie.  I hadn't heard of it, and just thought we'd try it.....very pleased.  Wouldn't mind purchasing this movie to watch over and over.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|This will always be one of my favorite movies: it's an atypical sports movie that tells us a history, shows a love of baseball, and the importance of people in our lives.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love couldn't put it down until I ended reading it. This author is simply getting better and better. I would recommend it to anybody who love a good sifi .
B003L77G8I|5.0|I purchased Bones 6th season for my wife and I. We are Bones fans. We will buy again. I will recommend to my friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first one I like but not love so I wait a long time since I finally decide to buy and read the next one. When I read this one just simply couldn't stop. Like so much that I finished in two days and had to buy the next one right away. Recommend it 100%
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I bought this game for my 4 year old and he loves it! I ended up playing and quickly became addicted! We both love this game. Great buy!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun game coins get refilled off line. I love it . Brings me back to the past when we went to the fair.
B005HSL626|5.0|Bought for my 4 year old . He loves it and as an adult it's kinda fun to play yourself! Great game to download!
0810996596|5.0|I did not know this book existed, and saw it on some horror website. I have been a fan of Metallica since 1983 when I bought Kill 'em All, at 14 years old. I was also a \\"monster kid\\", and had all the Fangoria's and Famous Monster issues that I could get my hands on. I have loved horror films ever since I can remember.<br /><br />This book is awesome and Kirk has an amazing collection. These are some of THE best photo's I've ever seen! The quality of this book is A+!!!!!<br /><br />The only thing that sucks is I do not have close to what he has, and what little I did have was lost to Hurricane Katrina, so this book can help me fantasize!!!<br /><br />If you are a Monster Kid, you need this, even Metallica fans may like it. I am sure the price will go sky high once all these are gone, so pick one up!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read the book because they are making the movie. The book is fabulous and I couldn't put it down. Now I can't wait for the movie!
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is another of our favorite films that we replaced from VHS version. Was amazing to see things in the Blu-ray that I missed in the VHS version. One of Bill Murray's best.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Greatest movie ever. If you haven't seen it then watch it. If you have seen it buy the Dvd/blue ray immediately.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a lot of fun.  I thought it would be easy but I was wrong!  try it you'll like it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Let me just put this out there really briefly - I do not like Christmas movies. I just don't. They all seem to be repeating similar plots over the same backdrop over and over and over again. There are only two Christmas movies I have ever liked, The Life and Times of Santa Claus and this one, Elf. Something new needed to be brought to the table, and Elf did just that.<br /><br />The first time I saw it was in Physics Class the day before Holiday Vacation back in my senior year of high school. I rolled my eyes and groaned, &#34;Oh, Will Ferrell in a Christmas movie. THIS will be fun.&#34; Much to my delighted surprise, I was very, very wrong. I loved every minute of the film. It was just so outrageous and fun.<br /><br />It just gives you this nice, warm feeling inside when you watch it. The importance of family, Ferrell's antics, pretty much everything. It's worth the rewatches you know you're going to face year after year after year. But instead of suffering through average audio/video quality and increasingly long commercial breaks, opt for the high quality bluray release for maximum fun for the whole family.
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|The action was good ,had great seens and color, but the audio was so low that I could not hear it without turning the volume way up.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The best ever. My wife and I have listened and enjoyed many times over. The music and acting are most compelling.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is a lot of fun! good app graphics and new user twists with force powers. Really like the view on the kindle
B000QI2ZWW|3.0|Strictly for kids. Watching it one time was more than enough for me. I would not recommend it for other adults.
B00015YVD6|5.0|This movie is a all time classic. I love this romantic and yet sad movie. It came in perfect condition, no flaws.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I enjoy this, but want another version,  I don't read in King James.  Please, if you upgrade with another reading version, please feel free to contact me so I can use this again.
630512762X|5.0|I love this movie it is so weird and yet intriguing. It came in perfect condition and was flawless. I love this mind bending movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game I'm so addicted to it the only thing I don't like is I have to wait 24hours until I can play again after I lose the chips or whatever they are
6305428425|5.0|This movie is funny, comedy and hilarious. I watch it all the time. Its a stupid-funny. Came in perfect condition with out any flaws.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Fantastic<br />Loved how it was a musical that the whole family could enjoy and laugh and watch.  Quality was great
0783225482|5.0|This movie gives you the creeps but in a good way cause it is so funny and makes you think about when you get old lol.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|This one tried to bite off more than it could chew. Some clever points tied to historical events but overall it was just dumb. Special effects were weak at times and the story was way over cooked. It's a comic book, graphic novel deal that missed its audience.
0767810856|5.0|This movie I found out was actually a true story and I just wished it was me. A true love story with hopes and dreams.
B00A14SQBU|4.0|This is one of Christina's best albums. It's a great pop/dance record and she sounds amazing as always. Christina is back!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie is so adorable and makes you believe you are a kid again and Santa does exist. I like the graphics.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The characters all blend, weaving a story I don't want to put down.  Stories of Kings, Knights, Queens and the intrigues of Court are always remembered.
B009CPGHDI|4.0|This was interesting for both me and my sweetheart. she knew Katy Perry's music well, but found this an interesting and enjoyable experience. Katy Perry was pretty new to me, but I liked what I say and found the whole show well done and both fun and worthwhile to watch.
B000V6Q9NU|5.0|Outstanding vocal/orchestral pieces bring to mind your favorite scenes from the movie!  If &#34;Gladiator&#34; is one of your top films, you'll be glad you made this purchase.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie that can be enjoyed by young and old alike! My husband and I were laughing right along with my 2 year old. :)
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I wish I could have known him better. This is a fantastic read for anyone who has any knowledge of his other work.
B0028R3NCU|2.0|The plastic is not durable on a key chain with a few keys. I ended up going with the [[ASIN:B002HGFKR8 Elago Mobile Nano II USB 2.0 microSDHC Flash Memory Card Reader (Black)]].
B008OOYALE|1.0|its awful how everytime you open the game you get spammed with &quot; o download this and that&quot; it does this everytime and you have to wait 5 minutes before you can play! bullshit
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids are addicted to this game.  Fun on the Kindle Fire, no wi-fi needed to play.  Hard to put down.
0307943232|2.0|I am quite fond of John Grisham books - especially in<br />the audio book form - but was disappointed in this<br />particular book.  It did not come up to the good<br />quality writing I have expected to find in John<br />Grisham books.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|this movie is really good. Good funny movie for kids and adults. If you haven't seen it you must, gonna be a classic
B001EC2ISA|5.0|It's hard to argue with something so nostalgic, even though when I was a child this movie scared the crap out of me. It is full of screwy characters and a few stereotypes about goth kids. It creates a strange and interesting world, so anyone that likes out of the ordinary fantasy should at least rent.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I purchased this set to send to my 18 year old cousin who is fighting cancer.  It is really true what they say --- laughter is the best medicine.  It is so good to hear him laugh while undergoing his chemo treatments, and Ihave this well written series to thank.
B002NZK5TG|4.0|great  movie
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Did the instant rental thing on Amazon, but this is very well done.  Really enjoyed it.<br />May have to buy it.
B003ELKNOK|5.0|I like this cd got it very fast just in a couple of days very happy with this cd love it.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|This is our third set of the Angry Birds games for home play. The mission cards range in difficulty from pretty easy to quite difficult. It takes a very steady hand and flat surface to play the game. It can get frustrating when you're trying to build the structure and you keep knocking it down without even launching a bird!<br /><br />All that being said, it's a lot of fun. It takes some practice with the sling shot to learn how to aim it and how far to pull it back. I like the addition of the \\"exploding\\" asteriod and the space helmet for extra points. We found that if you hit it just right it will aid in destruction. Again, that takes practice.<br /><br />The only negative to this is that it only comes with two birds. But we play with all three of our sets together so we just make it up on our own most of the time anyway.<br /><br />My boys like seeing how big a structure they can build with all the sets together and sometimes it can get pretty impressive. I like watching them try to figure out balance and symmetry with placement of parts. They get frustrated sometimes when it falls while they're building, but most of the time they laugh it off and keep trying.<br /><br />I found that it's much easier to get a storage tub or something instead of trying to fit it back into the box. As most things, it doesn't quite fit back in once you take it out.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wonderful girlfriend who just happens to be a huge justin bieber fan LOL At the time that i bought this, it was only three dollars more than the regular edition so i figured &#34;Ehh, why not.&#34; :b I've listened to a few songs with her and It's actually a better CD than his previous releases of garbage haha
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's really fun and simple. The game is very self-explanatory . The graphics are classically colored and mellow, and there's no obnoxious sounds or music,  just a soft little bubbly sound when you complete a &quot;flow.&quot;<br /><br /> The puzzles make you feel smart once you complete them because, despite most of them being quite easy, they do. require some strategic thinking.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very fun,  relaxing source if entertainment with a price you can't beat.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Fantastically gripping! I would highly recommend it to all of my friends and family. Superb acting and plot full of suspense.
1442359315|2.0|The details didn't seem to hold together.  In short, I didn't believe it.  As a Christian myself, I expected some mention of the Lord, as every other book of this type includes.
B009VB97EY|1.0|I watched this because my wife really wanted to, and I believe that the fact that even she said it was not good is enough to justify my rating. The plot was muddled and overwrought, the performances were laughable, and overall it was just not worth our time.
B005XN31LY|5.0|This was the perfect way to catch up on a series that is getting such rave reviews. The purchase was easy and downloaded instantly. Video was smooth and not jerky like some downloaded shows. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes sci-fi or fantasy shows.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved it - beautiful, fun, and full of unique puzzles (seriously, there were ones I've never seen in any other adventure game for kindle) . great buy!
B0049VZ222|5.0|The 1st season of the Walking Dead.  Wish there were more episodes.  Watched it in one weekend and bought the  2cd season  immediately after! Loved Both seasons!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a long playing game. No start over. No quick win. I'm playing the free version without spending real money for add ons. Fun to pick up for a bit at a time.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I just couldn't stop watching this season.  I watched the entire season in 2 days, and yes I work full time and have 2 young children.  I watched it all nigh tlong lol.  Def. reccomend  buying season 2 !
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, one of my favorites. A word of warning though: it can be very easy to purchase additional boards to play if you are not paying attention.
B004HYDM0A|4.0|Cannot believe the ending. Great documentary. Lets you see how crazy Internet dating could be. Jump in and get ready for a ride.
B002LFVE4I|2.0|Visually it was beautiful. But we longed for English subtitles. Neither my wife nor I could follow the English dialects and with a murder mystery that is of critical importance for enjoyment.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Not my kind of flick but everyone else liked it so I was generous with the rating. Not much of a story line, just skin.
B002RSU9PY|5.0|Old movie really well done.  Great story, acting and an all-around great movie!  I highly recommend watching this movie with someone special.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this series! I could not put the book down and plan on reading again very soon. Will look for more books soon.
B007REAIUE|5.0|I heard &#34;North Side Gal&#34; on the radio and thought it was a lost Little Richard track. Came to Amazon and ended up buying the complete CD. This is one of the best CD's I have bought in a long time. Every track is enjoyable and to be a young white boy, this dude has channeled the spirit of some of the all time classic R & B sounds with an ultimate perfection.  This is a definite feel good CD. You can't help boppin' when this guy's rockin'!
0061122416|5.0|Inspirational!<br /><br />Now that my children are all adults, instead of reading to them Christmas eve, we read a book the month of December and discuss it - great pick!!
0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries has hit a home-run on this approach to start-up businesses.  As a manufacturing professional with over 20 years of lean practices experience, I found this book realistic and applicable when implementing &#34;lean&#34; to your efforts.
1932100660|5.0|i've been macrobiotic for 34 years now as well as vegan.  I can't tell you how much my health improved when I made the switch at the age of 19.  I'm always sorry to  see friends getting themselves sick and even dying sometimes, but if ever I tell them how vegetarian diets are much healthier or alkaline foods are much healthier than acidic ones, they all just say show me the proof. Even the doctors!  Well here is the proof. What will you all ask for next?  When you die it is too late!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've watched the first two seasons of this series, and this is the best one yet. Such good acting and amazon makes my experience very nice. I highly recommend this series.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Both of my girls loved this movie and so did I!  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone.  Love it!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I find all the variations challenging and interesting.  It is a great way to relax.<br />I like it very much.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Need I say more? It's a great movie, watch it you don't believe me! You won't be disappointed, trust me.
B009E9R2OK|1.0|Bought the Celebration Day Zep Blu ray, expecting to see video of the concert, nope, it's audio only. The quality of the audio, even the DTS Master Audio, sounds just as compressed as an MP3. It's pretty lame.
B00881PPTO|2.0|what do you get for $1 that you are not getting from the the free version of this app?  cannot tell any difference.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is the best calculator app ever to exist. With the upgrade from the free version, you can choose from three awesome skins. :)
B003L77G6A|5.0|Even after watching the show live or maybe on DVR it's nice to sit and watch a bunch of epidsodes whenever you feel like it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I bought my first Vince Flynn book in the airport in Minneapolis during a lay over. Since then I have purchased and read every book he has written.  Mitch Rapp is the new James Bond! The only down side......Vince isn't writing fast enough!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|The movie was okay.  If you like lots of fast paced action.  Not the greatest, just okay.  Not a waste.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|As it started, I did not like it because of Merida's lack of appreciation for her mother, but as the story unfolded, I realized that they were taking us full circle, exploring the complexities of the mother-daughter bond.  I have three daughters and by the end I was crying.  I think it is a must see for mothers and daughters!
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Simply put, the Pixar animation earned this flick its fourth star. The storyline was just OK overall. Four stars is a comparison to other Pixar films, so, if you're a fan of the independent princess, give this movie a chance.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app.the longer you play this free app the harder it gets its so fun.I recomend getting this free fun awesome game.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is great! It is a great spin off from angry birds! another good game by rovio! :) I play it all the time!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|this is a very easy to use weather app with severe weather alerts and hourly and daily forecasts. easily the best weather app
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Like her Hair...too short too little magic. Like her accent too..over all good family entertainment.<br /><br />Younger kids won't mind, but many viewers accustomed to relying upon Pixar for something special will feel a sense of letdown due to the lack of adventurousness.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Ordered it for mother. She passed the class with A's using the book. Is up to date until they make a new one.
B004XQX4K0|5.0|I'm a casual javascript programmer. This book let polish my skills. Love the links the book have between chapters. That let me browse faster
1594135851|5.0|This series was the best reading I have found in a long time.  Original and imaginative.  Would recommend to everyone, young and old.  Reaffirms human desire of freedom for all.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really good when you've got no Internet or you're bored. I play in the car or when I'm wait for someone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great! It has a lot of action and a story line that keeps you watching. Highly recommended.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|...on my Arnova 10/G2 tablet. It would have been nice to know that ahead of time. But it was free so, no loss.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Nice big numbers, easy to see and use. Good interface and loads of options. Get it, you won't regret it!
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|I think the book is just reviewing HTML, not specifically HTML5 and then there is not so much discussion on the philosophy of HTML5, too!
B00979CS50|5.0|Even after all the years, this union is still putting out excellent rock. It reminds me of &#34;Every Body Knows This Is Nowhere.&#34;
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm just starting on here but so far I'm enjoying myself except for seversl  things.... its hard to replenish energy unless you can spend real money to buy gems. each room needs certain things to enter each and every time so you quickly run out. I wish they'd make it easier for those of us who either cant afford to spend real money or refuse to.
B0035HKWM6|5.0|Just introduced my 9 year old son to this movie and he loved it too!  Jim Carrey is outstanding as always.
B0077ZNCE2|3.0|I expected more from this movie.  It was just OK.  I hope Part II will give me the entertainment I was looking for.
B00931JMRE|5.0|The Great return of ZZ Top. The Blues, the rock, the hooks, the guitar tone. This new cd has it all.
B008IEFP1E|5.0|Anything from Maroon 5 is definitely a hit. Love the lyrics and the beats. Now I need to purchase some of their other albums.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|You can definitely see an improvment in the BCC wrinting on this record. This record was well thought out and executed perfectly.
B000Q99EAC|4.0|A nice redemption from Rocky 4and 5. He still has some fight in him at his age. Such a champion.
B005EXA8XC|4.0|iconic now, right? - part of our lexicon - Kurt had deep waters but they were troubled.  Sad that he checked out early.  Yeah life is hard and things suck - but nothing beats looking back and remembering all the treasurable moments as your kids grew up before your eyes.  Sorry you missed out on that Kurt.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Out DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition. The movie was fun to watch a will be enjoyed for a long time to come.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Helped me to see myself in a new light and understand my husband better. Would recommend, and have. Love is so important to us as human beings. This book helped me to see what I needed to feel love and how to show the people in my life that I love them how they need it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I do not know why this story has gotten so many bad reviews.  For one, I have to say the scary scenes are not so scary.  Both of my girls must just be Brave and Strong young girls, because both of them don't seem to be bothered by the movie.  Now we did purchase the book a while ago and have read the story to them a number of times and discussed the scary scenes.  We also sat down as a family, made popcorn and watched it all together with our 6yr old and almost 4yr old.  I have to say there are some parts that I was not a fan of--for instance how she visits a witch to change her mother and that the food was left around for her brothers to eat.  But the hype about the nudity and every thing else...what are we puritans.  My girls didn't even seem to notice that the boys were naked.  I thought I was a wonderful story about how some traditions should be changed and left behind!!!! Like marrying your daughters off at a young age, making them wear outdated clothing and arranging their marriages.<br /><br />Hence the break from tradition, which all the young men were happy about as well.  It was refreshing to have a movie that showed how a girl could be strong and not have to \\"live happily ever after\\" and marry prince charming. Or be saved by a man.  It showed how she must figure out how to make things right through problem-solving. My husband and I believe our two daughters need to learn to rely on themselves and someday, as I did, find a wonderful man to share their lives.  We do not believe that our girls need a man to be complete--nor should a man need a woman--they should be healthy independent persons who are not co-dependent.<br /><br />I thought it was a delightful show that let you see how both mother and daughter were not listening to one another and after mom gets changed into a bear, they spend time mending and bonding together.  I have to say, parents sometimes get very hung up in having to have things their way and do not listen to their children.  I am alsoguilty at times--no one is perfect.  I liked how the bonds were mended both concretely for young children (with the tapestry), verbally and physically for older children and parents.  Both the mother and Merida matured while working together to mend their relationship and change mom back into a human.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Loved the first Alien movie. Thought the rest got progressively worse. This one was only slightly better than the final alien POS.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|White Collar is funny, exciting, and intriguing. It is a great show, I highly recommend it. Season One on DVD is fantastic.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|This is a DVD that any age would love in their collection, I love that it has Amy Winehouse in it, every support act is brilliant especially Aretha Franklin, she makes me cry every time I listen to her song
0240815807|5.0|Excellent book for those just getting into recording or those looking to expand their audio knowledge base. Well written, informative, and easy to read. Great tips and advice. I recommend this book to everyone I meet who is looking for recording information.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Beetlejuice (please take note I did not say his name 3 times) is a very funny movie.  I had recorded it from the TV about 18 years ago and I have played it so much the VHS tape broke.  I love it, and can't think of anybody who could play any of the parts in this movie any better.  Thank you for have it available.
0307744434|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful book...not entirely what I expected, but a pleasant journey into magic and dreams.  the characters were unique and the story took many twists that kept me engrossed to the very end..an ending unexpected and thought provoking.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Good movie very different than I thought it would be. Great story line. I would recommend it. Ould watch again and again.
B009VLXMJA|2.0|It's a typical Taylor Swift cd with a little less talent and much more greed.  ...pass. I simply don't agree with this lady's desire to milk her audience out of their money.
B001NB545Q|2.0|Download was missing 1st 4-5 songs&#34;Bargain&#34; etc. Was very confused,disappointed and actually,angry. I think there was some type of error in downloading.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I am always a little scary of musicals.  When I hears that Tom Cruise is singing my beloved 80's music I became nervous, ...very nervous.  I saw the movie very objectively, and this movie was very very entertaining. Mr. Cruise is a very good singer and and an even better  actor. ...an excellent actor AND singer! Good movie if you grew up with this music!
B004JMY312|5.0|Such a classic film that still holds up after so many years! What a fun way to spend an hour and a half on Halloween!
B005HSG3VK|3.0|This case looks very nice. However, the elastic band gets stretched after a while and does not close the Kindle Fire properly. Also the inner material of the case leaves marks on my Kindle and it's not the kind that you can rub off.<br />Bottom Line: This is not a very functional case. Looks nice, bad protection. Not worth the money.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This edition of the Expendables  was much better than the first.  The production values were better and the story was more fun to watch unfold.  Lots of great actors in this one, with the one liners from other movies.  I would say this was a much more enjoyable movie.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|jobs lived the dream, money not for the sake of money but as ascorecard. that's why guys like rockefeller, morgan, gates and buffet give it away. it makes fertilizer for fertile minds.
B007RXRSEY|2.0|Not full of the emotional harmonies and soaring music I expect.  I was rather disappointed.  Hopefully the next album has a more dynamic backup band.
B0000041Q3|5.0|the opera is transformative and the two soprano roles are magical, the tenor is sublime. Bjoerling was perfect but Pavarotti made his role a living breathing person, emotion presented through that voice.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Classic movie and great quality. Would rent the movie any time. Great for the whole family. By the way I am 19 years old.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|disappointed. expected it to be better. if there is nothing else to watch, this will fill the void. glad it was only 1.99.
1439102813|4.0|Very enlightening - provided information about the disease that I had not previously known.  I had to keep reminding myself that this was not a true story.  Of course, I am now having to convince myself that every lapse of memory does not mean that I have the disease.
B005HSL626|5.0|well I think its really really good but its still a very nice appropriate challenging game. the hard part is the getting the blades. its hard but still fun fun fun!!!!!!<br /><br />  :) :) :) :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a good series and this book leaves you wanting to read the next one. It is a thought provoking book.
B0086700CM|3.0|I think that this app is ok because um... well do you know that game subway surffers well it is a hundred percent better. so to me temple run ain't that good pretty much its just ok so if you have a kid around the age of 3-8 subway surffers is more appropriate than temple run.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Four year old grandson can not watch it enough. we had to limit to watching it once a day. We watch the part where the train is on the cracking ice over and over.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|this app is spectacular!!! I rate it to anyone who DON'T like angry birds. I only rated it 4 stars because these levels are so challenging and hard and especially arduous. get it if you hate angry birds. seriously I mean it :)
B004P4S4NM|2.0|This has a few songs that I love, but the rest I don't care for. Not worth buying and in the future I don't plan on buying much music as it is extremely over priced.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this helped me with checking my homework on math. I rate it to anybody who needs help checking something. but this calculator its cool.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I bought this to make note taking in class easier. It works well in order to take notes. I'm not sure how it works when it comes to printing this off because I haven't used it for anything else other than taking notes. You can choose a memo or document type format so it works for note taking and for document printing.
B008458O3S|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. I'm not usually into games but this one can be pretty darn addicting. Best of all it was a free game provided by Amazon. Thanks Amazon!
B00899F0G8|5.0|This purchase is so worth the $1.99. Suspenseful, always on the edge of my seat. This show is my guilty pleasure. I am always wondering who the next &#34;A&#34; is in the show. I recommend this show to anyone who likes the &#34;who done it?&#34; type of show.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is awesome, I can make check list, notes, and I have a calendar I can write on to remind me of stuff.
B005SAV9SO|3.0|This movie does give teachers a bad name...not all teacher's are like this. I purchased the movie because I didn't know that I could download it, even as a rental. I would recommend renting it over buying it, but I would not recommend paying more than $3.99 for it....and even that may be too much.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Every picture I take I edit it, I love how you can change the colors and draw on it, it is the best editing app you will ever get and it's for FREE!
B004EIZCPM|4.0|I loved the story &#34;The Scarlet Letter&#34; and this movie was a funny, hip, new-age take on it. I also love the main character gets her revenge but does so in a non-violent way...I think that it is important for movies and T.V. shows to not promote violence and this movie shows that a person can get their point across without being violent. The movie is funny but serious and addresses issues from bullying, to gossip to rumor mills. I would recommend this product for the teenage and young adult crowd. I bought this movie so I watch it over and over again as it is one of my favorites. I love the lessons taught in this movie and I love the moral of the story.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It's great and all but, I wish it had sound for the videos. I also wish it was for free
B003QSMCKO|5.0|I love Disney! This movie is great for children and adults. I love how the movie has a lesson about pride and honor in it. I also love the animation and the funny parts too...so it has something for both kids and adults. The price right at $1.99 for a 48 hour rental...you can't beat that! :) This was the first time I saw this movie and I love it so much I watched it twice within the 48 hour period. I would recommend this product to both kids and adults. Even though, this was a rental, I would definitely purchase/rent this movie again.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|IT IS FUN! IT IS ALL THE ANGRY BIRDS PUT IN ONE! IT IS AWESOME! There isn't one thing I could change.
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie was ok. It shows what happens when an engaged couple stays engaged too long...so it does have a real life approach. There were some graphic moments that could have been left out. The movie is worth seeing once, so it makes a good rental but I would not recommend buying the movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|Everyone in my family are like, can we play that fruit game! I love it, with all the blades and backgrounds.
B0001XALT6|5.0|Movie review (no spoilers):<br /><br />Great writing, acting, and casting. A realistic movie that is one of my favorites. I'm not a big Stallone fan, but he was just right for the part of Freddy. Ray Liotta as Figgis possibly steals the show. Features an all-star cast of Slyvester Stallone, Robert DiNiro, Ray Liotta, Harvey Kaitel, Edie Falco, Michael Rappaport, Robert Patrick, Jeanine Garofalo, Peter Berg, more<br /><br />DVD extras review:<br /><br />A great director's commentary track that also features Slyvester Stallone and Robert Patrick.<br /><br />Several additional scenes not included in the original version<br /><br />Additional deleted scenes<br /><br />Highly reccomended!!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It is a little lame after a while, it is the same thing over and over , I like it but, not as much as my other apps.
034580404X|5.0|Got here quickly and was such an addicting book! I was sad when I finished reading them all though ahaha
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I don't like on two player how it keeps turning the board but, besides that is was a pretty good app.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 has picked up, and I am happy to be along for the ride!  I have read the comics, but I am also enjoying this version of events, especially Darryl and his brother, Merle.
B009M8E3K4|2.0|Did not like this video.  Amateurish recording and no music I wanted to hear.  Also, think a bit less of Mr. Young, after he voiced his childhood experiences with fireworks and turtles!!  Not all children are cruel to animals.
B005GSY23M|5.0|An incredibly well done soundtrack that not only is perfect for the movie but is also perfect for actually driving, with the noteable acception of skull crushing,  job well done.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This was an interesting idea, could have been a little more developed though. I am still on the fence of liking it or not. A very quick and easy read.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|If you love historical dramas this is a must watch. I learned a lot about Margaret Thatcher. This visual storytelling is very interesting as it weaves together the story of her life interwoven with her experience of Alzheimers. Note the significance of the last scene when she is washing the tea cup.
B0041LG08U|5.0|I was looking for a Dive watch and spent a lot time comparing different manufacturers. This turned out to be the best since Seiko provides a bullet proof movement and has much credibility behind their watches. Therefore this was a no-brainer purchase. The only downside to the watch is the band. It feels little light but does not affect the function of the watch.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  I love having a girls night in just to watch this movie and get together with some of my girlfriends.  Very well put together and very entertaining!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Poorly written, the purpose of which seemed more to massage the author's ego than to further an understanding of either the events surrounding bin Laden's death or the organization that brought it about.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Entertaining and had a lot of good one-liner jokes. It was predictable and relied on potty humor more than it needed to. The group of dads are the funniest characters. Don't buy it! Rent it if you want to see something light hearted with a sweet ending.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|My son has been begging for this and we got nothing but the video.  please post if there is something we need to do to fix it.  Very disappointed.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have the Logitech G 930 it works really good! Previously I wrote a review about the Logitech G 930. I did not know if it was the software or the microphone that was malfunctioning I found after reinstalling my software it worked fine. I gave it another star.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was so good I did consider calling in sick for work. It was unlike any other book I have ever read. I loved it.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This was a great documentary. I loved it! Very enlightening, entertaining and a bit heart wrenching too.<br />I would love to learn more and see a followup
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Boobie traps, pirate ships, treasure, and SLOTH.<br />Classic Movie. Just showed it to my six year old and he loved it.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|We remote this movie in Thanksgiving. I thought the plot was good but there were a few scenes that didn't make sense to the movie. As for the Alien movies go, it was the best one yet! It really gives you food for thought on the creation of life. The quality of the movie was awesome! We had no problems with the download or the play of this movie.
B00942Y0TM|4.0|It was great!  Just like watching the actual DVD, no issues with skipping or freezing.  Great visual quality, great sound.
B00A12VW86|2.0|After the last two albums, I thought they would run out of ideas. IMNSHO they did. I have listened to both of the first two albums of Uno, Dos,Tre and a week later I cannot remember one tune. BOOOORRRRINNNGGG!!!
B009329Y30|3.0|Wasn't as horrible as I thought it was going to be when my girl decided we needed to watch it together.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Love her voice and great production. Chill out tracks and tracks that keep me running at the gym. Overall fully satisfying album.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It didnt make me scream out, it was bland at sometimes and I liked the ending alot that it wasnt finished at the end
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Great movie. Lots of laughs. I hadn't seen it in years and forgot how good it was. Wow, times have changed. Since it was a &#34;period&#34; movie when it was made, it doesn't become dated. This is a classic.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This games takes me to another level. Sometimes I play it until I can't play anymore. Rovio Entertainment Ltd. has the greatest games around.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I first met and was warmed to Mitch Albom's writing in his book Tuesdays with Morrie and found The Time Keeper to be equally warm. There were many thoughtful phrases that captured my attention and stayed with me throughout the day. I would not give it 5 stars because, in my mind, those ratings are reserved for Les Miserables or classics along that line; however it is a strong 4 star read and one I would encourage friends to grab a cup of coffee (and maybe their journals) to sit with. Thank you, Mitch Albom, for sharing.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app. is the best ever, what would we do without it. I don't know but I never want to be caught without Adobe Reader.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|As great as the movie seemed my children got bored with the size of the picture. For some reason we were unable to enlarge it so that we could truly enjoy the film.<br /> I tried to tell Amazon and I have not heard back from them except for an email requesting me to write a review.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|first of all STOP DOING BAD REVIEWS!!!!!!!this is so much fun and it passes time by witch is good when I need to
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you have never watched The Big Bang Theory, you have missed a funny, smart and entertaining show. I would recommend this show to everyone with a slight warning...sometimes there is crude humor but what is nice with the DVD's ...I can skip anything I find objectionable. Most of the show is funny
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The beginning tells about who Pi is. And how he is.<br />The middle explains his beliefs and questions.<br />The last part tests all he is and isn't.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is a great season and I have enjoyed it. I highly recommend this season. I have found some of the humor crude but the great part of owning the shows on DVD is I can skip parts I find objectionable.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Fantastic update for Angry Birds. A must for any Star Wars fan... only complaint is how it requires keeping the Amazon App on my phone as well, taking up valuable space.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Loved it. Great message for young girls to be strong, independent young women... But always respect your mother! It's nice to see a challenge such as mother and daughter in teen years learning to listen and love one another.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this second book in the series. Can't wait for the third and final book to come out in May!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Batteries arrived on time and I checked the first one with a meter and the charge is full. And you can't beat the price. I would order again.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book is a good book, that I really enjoyed. U would recommend this book to all my friends. :)
B009LK6JS2|2.0|I never played it because it would not load. Oundes like a fun and interseting app to try. Hope you have better luck
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. great selection. very time consuming. passes time. five thumbs up. recommended for anyone that is bored. PLAY IT and love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great for keeping you on track with reminders about reading the Bible for even a short  amount of time can make a difference.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is so crazy and fun and hilarious!!!  I have played a LOT of mobile and Kindle games, and this has to be in the top 10 of all time (maybe top five).  You don't just draw your characters, you use color and sketch drawing to solve puzzles, find clues, etc.  It's just good fun.
0761169431|5.0|This was a gift, and the recipient is delighted with it, especially after the Disney purchase which may result in changes from the 'original'.
B00005N9CV|5.0|ITIS THE OPPOSITE OF THE EAR AND BRAIN-DAMAGING MUSIC WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE TODAY.<br />IT COULD ESTABLISH A ROMANTIC SETTING FOR AN EVENING WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Addictive like all of the Angry Bird games.  The commercials as no more or less annoying than with other ones, but not so bad as to make me want to buy the commercial free one (I have 2 that are commercial-free, so I know the difference).
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I loved the characters! A trip down memory lane. The roles were made for the actors. A must see movie!
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Instead of paying to rent this movie, I decided to just buy it.  Having buyer's remorse.  I LOVED Tangled, which is one reason I bought Brave without renting it first.  Brave was ok but I just didn't fall in love with it like I did with Tangled.  I'm not sure why, it was just boring.  Worth the price of a rental, not buying the DVD.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Recently I had been encountering Credence songs on Youtube videos and realized how many of their songs I really liked. I initially checked on Itunes because of a gift card but they did not have anything with their greatest hits. Came to Amazon and found Chronicle: 20 Greatest Hits at an INCREDIBLE price and immediately purchased it.<br /><br />This was one of the BEST music deals I have purchased on Amazon and have listened to the songs multiple times already.  If you grew up in the 60's as I did, you probably remember their songs...if so, get this collection!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|great book<br />Liked all the debts fufghhgfbjb hjvghcbjcg Hugh Fischer Xv,Cv gdfhcdgcch Gb hvhvgbcgvhccc ghcgbcgbvgh gbvhbbvhjhhhg I have the whole series
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and all over the house - it scared me so badly.  It starts off with a chain saw event & only escalates upward.<br /><br />The sex scenes are much better in this movie than in the Godfather, LOL.<br /><br />This is a must see.  After the movie was over, I swept, mopped, and cleaned my house to slow down my adrenaline.
B00A6N7BS0|1.0|senseless movie.  Easily the worst movie that Oliver Stone has done.  The acting was bad, the story was terrible, not sure what else to say (and I'm a fan of his previous works)
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I can't believe that someone as creative as Tim Burton could have directed this movie!  With such a starring cast, it's unbelievable that this movie could be as bad as it was.  Not worth the movie to rent or buy, or the time spent watching it.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I just discovered the Script about a year ago and still enjoy them!  Great new cd.<br />I love the play on words in their lyrics.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|good acting, good special effects. Original story. Only gave it a 4 because it seemed to be lacking something, like maybe a directors cut.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I loved this album. Bridgit Mendler's voice has always appealed to me, every since I heard Lemondade Mouth. This album was great, all the way from Hurricane to Hold on for Dear Love. She goes from R&B to Pop so quickly, I don't what had happened. The lyrics a bubbly and sometimes deep (Your like a good book snuggled up on the sofa/when it's rainin outside) and (if we're not stupid we'll go far/hold on for dear love). Hurricane really surprised me. Bridgit can rap! lol. Anyways, this album is a keeper.
B001NLKT60|5.0|this is one of  the best books i have read,it has a lot of interesting senarios and keeps you reading
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can I say? Iron Man + Cap. American + Hulk + Thor + 2 bad ass assassins... oh and Samuel L. Jackson.<br />This movie is packed with actions and humor, a must have.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Good movie. I like any movies with dancing in it.  Channing Tatum is a great dancer! Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly would have been proud! (or jealous)
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This is a film for grown ups. Younger audience might not enjoy this as much as the other productions.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it is because it is the same story as Finding Nemo. Just<br />different characters and different setting, but the idea and lesson behind it are the same.
1451695195|5.0|Finally, someone I can really trust.  His experience answers so many questions for me.  The cosmologists really need to rethink themselves.
0446580848|5.0|I do not understand the bad reviews this book has received. I thought it was a great read. The way the characters are developed along with the author's description of the surroundings is brilliant. I found it hard to put down and did not want it to end. John Corey at his best!
B000UU4NE4|1.0|This movie is so cheesy it makes you want to crawl out of your skin.  After what seemed like twice as long as the movie actually was, I was left wondering why spider man had to dance and sing his way into pain and misery for the audience.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Despite the quality animation, I could not identify with the decision of the main character to put her strict but caring mother in danger merely to satisfy her selfish ends.  We were reminded of a standard Disney theme: headstrong young female defies parental authority and although her life is threatened and many other lives are put at risk, ultimately everyone has 'learned' from this selfish person and she is gloriously rewarded for her defiance.<br /><br />Yes she was unaware of the risks she was taking, but that's the definition of selfishness - not taking any time to consider the consequences your actions might have on others.<br />`<br />Tasty but deadly poison for 8-14 year old girls IMHO.  My children will not be watching this film.
B0081JAED0|5.0|I have always been a big Garbage fan and their latest CD has some tracks that are already classics in my book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I could not put this book down!  What an experience! I was a believer before reading the book.<br />I am totally sold now!  Thank you,  Doctor! May God continue to bless you.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|The Deftones seem to be making their best music at this point in their much heralded career.  This album definitely proves that this band has plenty of more good years in them.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|It's nice to see that Bob is still at the top of the game in writing the best material out there. If there's anyone that pushes music to excess it's Dylan, with over 50 years passing since his first LP release, Dylan is still a relic to be reckoned with. This is a mandatory for any Dylan fan and a must have for any music fan. A classic from beginning to end. With two tracks coming in at over 7 minutes, one over 9 min, and one nearly 14 minutes; &#34;Beautiful Excess&#34; is what Dylan has been bringing for over half a century. Enjoy this Great Musical Icon as he has become even more classic with age. ENJOY!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|A series with the right combination of action, suspense and comic book adventure. A solid hit for fans of this genre.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Just gave this to my grandson for his 10th birthday. He was ecstatic and so was everybody else at the party. They all took a turn with it. I like it because it is made well and worth the price. The idea behind the levels of play keeps kids interested a long time. This is my third time I've bought a Perplexus as a gift and have gotten great feed back from all the recipients.
B00846TTDG|4.0|It was an interesting movie with some good parts in it. It wasn't a blockbuster but it's worth seeing at least once.
B0086449YA|3.0|There's nothing in the 2-album set that is particularly memorable (ie: Romeo and Juliet, Shangri-La, The Bug), lyrically and musically it seems more a reflection of Mark's exercising his new studio than any striking need to produce some great songs.<br /><br />That's not necessarily a bad thing. The recordings ARE remarkable sounding. There are a few interesting pieces, in particular \\"Radio City Serenade\\" stands out for me as a departure from his more recognizable efforts; you almost expect Linda Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle to take over after the lead-in chords. \\"I Used to Could\\" would probably make the Country Charts and be a hit in the bar room jukeboxes, if anyone in that genre was paying attention.<br /><br />All-in-all, this effort is enjoyable for us true fans who love his work regardless, especially with Fletcher on board, but for the mainstream audience, there just isn't much here to grab on to. If Mark's decided that he'll use the remaining years of his career to play what he enjoys, good for him, unlike say...Springsteen...who seems to be determined to dish out crap year after year (since Magic), Mark's dedication to the \\"sound\\" is admirable. However after this effort, Kill to Get Crimson, and Get Lucky, I'm hoping he'll take some time to really put together a more homogeneous and textured album the next go around. - time to put that studio to good use Mark - Looking for something memorable!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched a couple of episodes with my boys, they play those video games that have zombies in them.  I got on Nexflix and watched season 1 & 2 because I wanted to know the back story.  Then when I was up to date I realized I missed four of season three episodes so I went searching for a place to view them, Apple was a dollor more an episode, and I am a penny pincher so I bought the package deal and saved even more.  Thanks Amazon, you rock!
0425264351|1.0|Child's Jack Reacher is less plausible as a human being with a personality than is Edgar Rice Burroughs's John Carter. The language and the details ring false; Reacher jumps to illogical conclusions (which are always correct); the military details are laughably wrong. The book heaps coincidence on coincidence. Reacher kills, by my count, eleven people, two of them without even knowing who they were - they were following him. So he shoots them in the back, not knowing if they are good guys or bad guys, crooks or the FBI. Oh, wait, they're Hispanic, so they're obviously evil.<br /><br />The book is set in an imaginary town, Margrave, Georgia. It's magical. It's an hour south of Atlanta, it's an hour north of Macon, it's an hour east of the Alabama state line, it's an hour and a half west of Augusta. There is no possible geographical location for it. They grow peanuts and tobacco (no, they wouldn't; it's above the fall line). A blind black musician used to walk from Margrave to Jacksonville, Florida, back in the thirties. It's easy because Jacksonville is \\"just across the line.\\" Three hundred miles, though.<br /><br />The novel takes place in 1996; one of the many murders occurs at Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta. Except that it's described as having features it never has had (trust me on this, my family has worked there for many years). In the crucial scene, Reacher can't protect a woman because he's on the wrong side of a nonexistent glass barrier that divides the huge underground corridor into two lanes of traffic, one going toward the gates, one going toward Baggage Claim. There was never such a barrier. The crowd is so dense that Reacher jumps up onto the rail of the moving sidewalk (moving the wrong way) and runs along it against the flow. Wouldn't happen. The woman is swept along by another incredibly massive crowd.<br /><br />Then in Baggage Claim, someone tosses her onto the carousel, rides with her back through into the handling area, and knifes her.<br /><br />And nobody notices. That dense crowd must have evaporated. And there are no baggage handlers behind the scenes, none at all, working on this astoundingly hectic travel day.<br /><br />Give me a break.<br /><br />What else? The style is stultifying. Little tiny short fragments of sentences abound, stuck together in what seems to be completely random order. It gets old very fast. I cannot believe in any of the characters - a twelve-year-old white boy asks his daddy to beat a black man to death for him, Pop does it in broad daylight on a public street, bludgeoning the victim to a pulp with a metal-headed cane, in front of a witness . . . and nothing is done about it. No, no, no. The whole book is unbelievable, poorly written, and wretchedly researched. I won't read another, and I'd advise you to give this one a miss.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My favorite Woody Allen flick.  And I don't really like Woody Allen THAT.  So I suppose that discredits my rating.  Shove off.
B00124BNF4|5.0|Totally original and indeed awesome. Talking Heads are one of the bands that were just different and enjoyable. Definitely a good buy.
0783227434|3.0|This was great when I rented it on VHS 20 years ago.  It's still funny and amusing and brimming with one-liners.<br />Just not scary by a LONG shot
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This guy is so big now. His newest album is really incredible and fun to listen to. I do so enjoy all his music, although I'm a bit tired of hearing &#34;Somebody That I Used to Know&#34; on the radio all the time. He has so many wonderful songs on this album. It's a shame you don't hear more of them on the radio.
B00005R24K|4.0|The scariest of the Evil Dead franchise.  Despite its horribly low budget, the mood is good and the scares are real.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought it was a good read! I also thought it was one of those stories where the good guy is lost but Grisham has a twist to the &#34;good guy vrs the bad guy&#34;!!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any and every adult I know!
B005J9ZFQG|4.0|This movie is half horror, half Gorey comedy.<br />Just about the original Cabin-in-the-Woods type of movie. Required viewing for horror fans
0451196716|2.0|This is one of those books you look at and you say to yourself, this might be good. Then you realize within the first few pages that you've made a lot of mistakes in your life and if you were honest with yourself, you would never listen to your own advice.    The problem with this book, other than the fact that it was written by Steven King, is that the plot is so implausible that you laugh at the absurdity. I was waiting to see what mental asylum these teens broke out of to join a competition in which there is a 99 percent chance you die. Perhaps this was Steven Kings way of saying \\"I can put my name on anything and it will sell because my name is Steven F-ing King.\\" He then proves how gullible the public is by writing a book about walking. Wow. It made me want to crawl for a week in protest.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|get this game right now it so fun beat every one on thier.my sister can not get past the firth level.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My friends told me about this and it's been very easy to download books for a beginner as I in using e-books.  I highly recommend this.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|any child would love this movie for holidays Im an adult and I just love this movie its one of my favorites
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|My friends told me about it.  I'm still learning the game, but it's fun and challenging.  I highly recommend it.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I use this with my laptop and GPS software when I'm traveling by car. I like a large screen when viewing. It works well with my MSI Windows 7 laptop.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is the best out of his first three novels. I didn't think Carrie could be topped, but with more experience and patient writing, King has out done himself. Every chapter has a purpose, every subject away from the main characters is nessassary. There are moments where your brain just clicks after reading something that finally connects 3 chapters later. Great climax, awesome ending. A must read!
B005V1WZ10|5.0|This cd is a blending of dubstep and classic korn to create something new with the korn vibe I love. I like all the tracks. With remember who you are, I didn't find very many tracks I personally wanted to crank up, so this cd is an awesome find.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Quick, which film features a child with uncertain heritage stewarded by vampires and werewolves and a war between two supernatural factions over a family's choice?  Before there was \\"Twilight: Breaking Dawn,\\" there was \\"Dark Shadows.\\"<br /><br />Instead of Edward we have Barnabas (Johnny Depp, vamping it up), an old-school vampire in love with a pretty young thing who is played by an actress named Bella Heathcote (playing Josette du Pres).  It seems Barnabas made the mistake of having an affair with the family's maid, Angelique Buouchard (Eva Green) who also happens to be a witch.  She uses witchcraft to push Josette to suicide and curses Barnabas with vampirism.<br /><br />Fast forward to the 1970s and Barnabas is unearthed, returning to his ancestral home to reclaim his legacy.  But that legacy is in tatters: matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer) lives with her ne'er-do-well brother Roger (Johnny Lee Miller), his 10-year-old spooky son David (Guilliver McGrath), Elizabeth's oversexed teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), and a handful of staff consisting of Caretaker Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), David's psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), and David's new governess Victoria Winters (also played by Bella). David, it seems, believes he can talk to ghosts. It's not a happy place.<br /><br />Barnabas' return leads to the discovery to two startling facts: Angelique is an immortal with an iron grip on the town and Victoria is the reincarnation of Josette.  Torn between the two women, Barnabas plans to return his family to its former glory while fending off his own bloody thirst for women and blood.  It's enough to make a vampire blush.<br /><br />The trailers for \\"Dark Shadows\\" gave the appearance of a comedy, which likely set critics' expectations for an entirely different film.  But this is a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration that is alternately macabre and humorous - tonally it's no different from any of the other movies they've produced.  The difference is they're playing in someone else's sandbox.  \\"Dark Shadows\\" has a long legacy compressed in to just a few hours.<br /><br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" is entertaining as the anti-vampire movie - Barnabas frequently walks around with blood trailing down the corners of his mouth - but it has a lot of ground to cover.  Some characters are more fleshed out and relevant than others, leaving Roger a caricature, Carolyn a brooding teen stereotype, and Julia yet another quirky wisp of a personality.  There's enough here that it could easily be fleshed out into a soap opera...which means the film is faithful to its source material.<br /><br />A soap opera about vampires, ghosts, and werewolves?

B001KTATIS|3.0|This DVD is okay but hispanic subtitles are annoying........cannot be removed.<br />Interesting how some of these stars further their film careers.<br /><br />It is worth seeing and possibly owning???
0761169253|4.0|Enjoyable, cute and entertaining way of presenting life's truths. Artist or not, it makes good reading. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to explore ways to reach more goals.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had heard about this series from many people, and read a lot about it, so was eagerly awaiting the DVD release (since I don't watch TV and generally wait until a series of interest is released for full-season purchase).  The plotting, acting, and production are superb, the characters pull you right in, and the payoff in the final episode sets you up to await eagerly the second season!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best thrillers I have really enjoyed watching with my girlfriend on amazon.com on my ps3 thank you amazon for excellence and for some of your free watches of the walking dead. If it wasn't for you guys I wouldn't be able to watch this cause I have no cable or dish network.
B002DD67XG|4.0|It is a good overview of James Taylor hits. I would recommend for anyone that is a fan of his work.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This movie gives an insight into the future of most baby boomers and the choices we will all have to make due to lack of income and retirement.
B000NA28I4|3.0|I saw the movie before reading the book, but having read it, I like the movie better. The book goes on forever, and I don't really recall Eragon doing anything during the finale except getting knocked unconcious. At least in the movie he does something. As far as movie adaptations go, I think the filmmakers did a good job. The visual effects, music, and acting are great. Ed Speelers brings Eragon to life.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Hooray for a film that treats seniors as &#34;real&#34; people with the foibles and triumphs of all ages.  The characters are individually well developed while surrounded by sights and sounds of a culture different from their own and interesting to the senses.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I don't usually play games. but Quell is so fun and relaxing that I had to get Reflect as well...
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|I am a Wes Anderson fan to begin with.  But this movie in its own right is great.  There is a simplicity and innocence to it all on the face, but some much deeper underlying themes to explore about the human condition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The spins, twists and possibilities are endless - plus excellent character development.  The best of all worlds plus zombies galore!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is good... only downfall with this game and games like it is the poor energy system that it has
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I don't much care for vampire movies but followed the hype on this one and was pleasantly surprised.  The blending of history certainly helped and this, as do many horror-type movies, has its over the top moments but all in all is a good watch.  I recommend it for those that share my tastes.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I have both Accuweather and eWeather. I run them both and like them both. since I live in an earthquake zone, I have a morbid need to know how many earthquakes a day are occurring each day. Too many!<br /><br />both programs are worth having. the other crashes when looking at radar maps; this doesn't. That has news; this doesn't.  for a big quick review of what is going on and what is coming, eWeather on tablet view is great.<br /><br />FYI,  I have 3 sources of info, another review said there were only two.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well written but I wasn't too far into it when I figured out what was really going on. Ending was just so-so for me. Definitely worth a read if you are a Grisham fan.
B00138CZ8S|5.0|This is a great album that I rediscovered recently. Because of the changes in technology (record, 8-track, cassette, CD and now digital) it has taken me a while to recollect some of the music of my youth. Taj kind of followed a traditional blues format when he first came out. But the power of his vocals clearly distinguishes him from other blues players. In his later career he experiments with other genre but on this his first album you can really hear the roots of his music. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves the blues!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Just a great entertaining movie. The plot was good and plenty of action, The animation and scripting were superb! Good for all ages!
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Lovely movie ... Binoche, Dench, and Olin are such a force.  Depp ain't bad either ;)  Be prepared though to crave some chocolate.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I had the free version and loved. I got the paid version because it was a way to say thanks, kind of like shareware in the old days. it works great on my Fire, and it tells me the status. and I don't have to go through a bunch of screens just to see a pix of a battery.
B0014VPFTA|3.0|It's one of those CDs, you can pop in the player and just listen to without skipping any tracks.  But my favorite track is &#34;Gravity&#34;
B003XMWSSY|5.0|I have read 20-30 books on writing and I give this one 5 stars. The reason is that, apart from reading a lot in this book that I already knew, I also got some good ideas out of it, and almost none that I disagreed with. The only way to get better in writing is, apart from writing itself, to read as many books on writing as you can. It is for a reason they say good writers 'steal' all kinds of ideas and that includes the knowledge passed on about the craft. I have therefore given up finding The book on writing -  just like perfect writing, it does not exist and again, if I get something new and useful out of it, I win.<br />I also enjoy reading about writing. This book was confident, and well written in tone and structure, so fun to read in itself. Furthermore, the author wisely started off by not wanting to tell how one should write. All you can do is to show how to avoid writing mistakes. And there are many. My goal is, apart from getting new ideas, also to know as many ways how not to do things since they would also creep into my work.<br /><br />To take a small example of something new I got from this book is the eternal show versus tell discussion. By simply telling a character stole money and was a crook, well, he is a crook - the writer just told us. This book pointed out that by showing a character actually stealing money, you leave things more open, with more room for interpretation for the reader (maybe he did it to help the poor, like Robin Hood? maybe you still think he was a crook). This showing will involve the reader more in the story, make the story his own, etc. Of course there were more examples like this, but they will be different for each of you.<br /><br />What I found the strongest in The First Five Pages is that it is written by an EDITOR himself. Someone who has actually read thousands of manuscripts himself and who has distilled the do-not's of writing out of this experience.<br />In this book you see how an editor looks at a new manuscript and how you can increase your chances that the editor would ask you to send more (or all) pages. Of course all editors hope to find a great manuscript and they will recognize one when they see it. But what was an eye-opener for me is that the editor, looking for that great new book, at first mostly screens a page from a manuscript for a reason to toss it aside, due to the fact that so many others are piling up to be read. Some very trivial things can easily ruin your long writing work, like using the wrong lay-out - the editor might not even read your otherwise great story, what a waste! The book is full of other less trivial examples, for instance dialogue or how important it is to find the right editor for your genre. You can see this by going to the table of contents in the 'look inside' feature.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is the editor who will get your manuscript and who will decide on if it is going to be published, and ultimately read by the public.<br />If you spend so much time in writing a book that you hope to be published, reading this book will be worth your investment.and how you can increase your chances that the editor would ask you to send more (or all) pages.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|it was alright but started slow. Depp is my favorite actor, and that's why I rented the movie online. Still it was slow.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|its a cool game but you get bored easily in like 3 levels. I like it and I think you should try it out. I mean its FREE! why not<br />peace out!<br />ADVENTURE
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I chose this Rating cause it DID NOT get delivered to  My Kindle Fire<br />I play Angry Birds a lot .......
B004JK61K0|3.0|I use Earthlink for email. The native app on my Kindle Fire HD wouldn't connect so I was trying different apps until I got one that worked. MailDroid wouldn't connect either. K-9 Mail connected on the first try - both receiving and sending. It works which is great but I'd like to see a better UI (which is why I downgraded it).
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show is very entertaining. The two leads are so cute and funny together, but its the combination of characters, including family and work characters that makes it really good. There is a nice balance between Comedy, Kitch, and Drama.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Played it for maybe 10min and got bored. Uninstalled it eventually. Maybe ok for kids or slow adults LOL ;)
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is NOT A MINECRAFT RIP OFF minecraft pe has NOTHING COOL about it no nether no end no nothing this game is WAY better. Oh and to you minecraft lovers Notch will not care about your posts!!!!!!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I loved the movie and the book is turning out even better.  I keep seeing reviews and a lot people don't seem to get it but I find it so spot on in terms of form and content.
B007ZLKKZM|3.0|Hadn't really paid much attention to George since the rest of the group ended up being more popular.  Leaned a lot more about George Harrison.
B005LAIHRC|1.0|The best part of the movie was the final credits. All 3 of us who watched it couldn't figure out why this movie bombed with so many stars. The acting was bad and the singing was worse. My bluray player is going through detox after last night's screening.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|If you like Donald Fagen's solo output or the last two SD albums you will like this.  The main difference is a loose funkiness that is a tad more present with this go round.  Where SD would keep disco at arms length in the 70s. Donald dives right in on one track seemingly without the usual ironic detachment that you would expect.  A range of grooves.  Perhaps not breaking new ground with the chord changes but that's okay.<br /><br />Our post-apocalyptic sage leads the way, yet again.
B004F5GLJ0|4.0|Escape into the Twilight word....  a fun diversion!  I am looking forward to the last of the series.  Had to restart the video a few times to get through it.
0843175044|5.0|Great Gift Item! bought these for my boyfriend because he used to read them as a kid! books came in great condition
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I was looking for a simple notetaking app for my Kindle Fire, and after a couple of disappointing choices, found just the right one.  This app requires only a couple of clicks and you're ready to go.  You can choose the color of your page, and have several different fonts and font sizes to choose from.  The program saves automatically so there are no worries of losing your work.  I highly recommend this app over all the others.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Tired, unfunny and unimaginative.  I couldn't make it further than 40 minutes in and then I had to turn it off.  Probably great for FANS of Tim Burton.  Not good for everyone else.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great! In the beginning, it might seem too easy, but quickly it progresses into more difficult puzzles that challenge your spatial awareness. Awesome game.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|it's ok but there's a time limit on each world you make<br />so it's your choice if you want to get it or if you don't
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Fast-paced and somewhat predictable. Full of bad guys, worse guys, and revenge. But not to worry. Most of them get killed.
084313349X|5.0|Great Gift Item! bought these for my boyfriend because he used to read them as a kid! books came in great condition!
B000002J0G|4.0|By The Ritual, the band was getting lighter and moving out of thrash metal. Low brings back the heavier, thrashier Testament though along with hints of death metal. The songs aren't as fast though but heavier than anything they did before. They bring back the screaming in their music but Chuck Billy does lower death metal vocals rather than the higher pitched, Slayer-esque screams on The Legacy. It might not be as good as The New Order or The Gathering but it's one of their better albums and i enjoyed it more than The Ritual. I even liked The Ritual also.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game for all ages.I love it as well as my 4 year old daughter. I regimens this game to anyone. fun fun fun
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love this app but will make you unproductive!! I got it as a free app but would have paid for it.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Just a great, feel good love story with magic, adventure, and comedy! I put it right up there with princess bride.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Did not give it 5 stars because it sometimes sticks, that is, it just stops and has to be shut down to continue.<br />However, I very much enjoy playing this game.  It's very good for the mind and hard to quit playing.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie for kids and adults.  The whole family really enjoyed the movie.  Our kids ages 6 and 3 have watched the movie several times in the last couple weeks.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|One of the better comic book treatments I have seen of late.  I recommend it as action-packed, escapist nonsense. While the length is long, it doesn't drag at all.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|I really love this movie, and Tom Cruise is always a hit. Strangely, though, the scene where he's typing and nodding off at the computer puts me to sleep without fail; it's very suggestive. Who needs Ambien when you can sleep with Tom?
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Saw the movie and watched it again. Loved it. How many people grew up with the music weren't singing along.<br />The biggest surprised for me was Tom Cruise singing. And he did good.
B000I9YX06|5.0|I've watched this movie over and over again... Decided to buy my own copy and that's the long and short of it!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|It's good to see a story go someplace that the Star Trek universe hasn't explored yet. I never wanted to believe there wasn't more of a future for Data.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Quite an enjoyable story with many likable and amusing characters.<br />I can only fault the lighting in &#34;scary&#34; scenes toward the end, which, in streaming over the Internet, were too dark to make out much of what was happening. This took the edge off the experience, leaving an impression of mostly &#34;what just happened?&#34; I hope that this is not the same on BR/DVD.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This was loved by Kids and Adults alike. The free version gives you plenty of play time, but the purchased version is even better.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|love their sound. pure music without all the processing of todays &#34;music&#34;. Loved them on the Sing Off and can't wait to see them live
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok this is frekin AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thers only a few things iv got to say: more realistec and better tools to build and you can make ovens and you can make DIMOND tools and so much more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you have to get this app!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have been a fan of this series from day one.  I still love it and am astounded how the writers keep coming up with great scripts.<br />It is a must have.
B008458O3S|5.0|I've found this to be thoroughly enjoyable and challenging puzzle game with no drawbacks. Definitely worthwhile and progressively challenging so it's accessible to many ages.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Pretty good story mostly seen for the many stars in the cast and favorite characters portrayed. Sure to be a lasting hit.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is played all year long at our house. I had to but another one because ours is scratched bad.
B001F6ZIXW|1.0|The video was very stop and go every few seconds, all the way through. Making viewing it impossible. I have a newer quality laptop as well and I have had no other issues watching video from other sources. This was a waste of money for me.
B009PEPML4|5.0|Every genre has a pioneer that builds the foundation for those who chose to follow, and this band is arguably that pioneer for post rock. With this new, long awaited release we are gifted with another tragic yet beautiful album that paints a different picture each listen. I strongly urge fans to listen to set fire to flames, a silver mount zion, kill carla and hrsta
B009AP2G26|3.0|I was disappointed with the story, but I still like the music from this series.  I hope they figure out how to make the story interesting and funny again, instead of just tragic.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a really good game and if you are bored than you should really download this app it alows you to make u feel better. in this game some weird creatures try to chase u and you have to run away from them. This game is really adventurous. If u love adventures than this is the right game for you. I think that you should really download this game because it is really a good game.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|One of the handy apps you need when browsing the web, cannot do without. Need it for opening all kinds of downloads.
067165991X|4.0|This book gives a thorough grounding in the ways states interact with each other. Some may find it a slow read, if only because it takes analyzation to be truly understood. Kissinger gives motives and consequences for wars, treaties, and alliances through the ages to show how diplomacy as a career and an art has evolved.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|My 7 yr. old son plays this over & over again, it keeps him playing for hours of fun.<br />Great racing fun, & keeps him busy for a long time.
B005DI9HPI|3.0|This was a fun read for those who are vaguely familiar with New York. I don't think I will be reading any of the others in the series, such as I heart Paris.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game so much.I was waiting for it to come out on kindle fire and it finally has so I was like so happy when it did.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Surpassed my expectations it charges faster than the one that comes with kindle fire when new. So I would purchase another if I ever need a new one.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Another way to waste time, but it is cute, use it while I wait for my girls when they shop or when she is late getting out of work and I am bored and don't feel like reading.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Great Movie!  My granddaughter loves watching this movie over and over.  It was exciting and interesting for the adults too!
B009SQR28A|5.0|It would not be Christmas with out enjoyin<br />g this movie for the whole entire family at our home.<br />Just had to buy it for keeps!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is one of the most enjoyable series from Masterpiece.  The characters for the most part are believable and interesting and complex.  But the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it became too contrived with all the troubled relationships toward the end of the series.  I will definitely have to watch the 3rd season.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|A delightful story. My grandkids loved it. The slapstick humour and sweet rendering of the characters was fun for all of us who watched.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Enjoyed playing. Was fun and time went by quickly when playing. Would recommend. Would purchase more mahjong tile games in the future.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|Spent a lot of quarters on this game when I was a kid, still as frustrating as back then, really ate up the quarters trying to bust this game.
B005R4255C|2.0|Poor remixes of Michael's old songs from the new pop artists.<br />Nothing interesting, I listened to the CD only once.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I was very impressed to be able to share my families fb pictures to those ppl who do not have fb.<br />My husband has passed on, & fb had so many of my favorite family pics. of him & our family.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Intriguing, extremely well acted and suspenseful.  Oldman is amazing. was true to the original book, which can be extremely complicated with many subplots.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|My wife loves the series totally. I love the graphics and the insight to those days when Madison Avenue was a mysterious power.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|I own the DVD versions as well. These have been remastered and look AMAZING! It is by far the best out in print. I reccomend buying the trilogy as buying them individually is ridiculous! Part 3 is selling for $40.00 alone last i checked! Very quick and prompt delivery transaction! I am very satisfied with this product! They gave Robo the Justice he deserves ! A must buy for Robocop fans
B009FZHYKU|5.0|how bout a thousand stars!! We been watch it from the begining! Awesome show. great job.<br />better not kill Daryl! hahaha
0316228532|4.0|Rowling is a compelling storyteller, and though this setting is far from the magical world of Harry Potter, it is another hard-to-put-down book. Approach it with an open mind, and you will find a well-written, well-told contemporary novel.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This was my 7 yr. old son's 1st movie he sat all the way through the movie w/o getting bored.<br />We watch this movie every Christmas together.<br />Nothing but a 5 star rating on this all time Children's Christmas classic!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is quite a fun game. Between the game types the levels dont really change much but all n all quite a well designed and enjoyable game. :)
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Couldn't stop watching and it had me laughing.  Sophisticated humor.  Dry pan.  Just loved the story line and humor.  A movie with great re-watch-ability.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great creative story line!!  Well played out by the characters!  Great scenes created!!!!!Highly recommended! Will watch  many more times again!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love The Walking Dead. One of my favorite shows!  Love, love, love it. Very edge of your chair entertaining!
B009IF82SK|5.0|I gets better and better  every year!!!! The writers never cease to amaze me.  The stars outshine each other...  Outstanding!!!
B005LAIIFS|4.0|What if Santa, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Jack Frost teamed up to defeat an evil force that conspires to corrupt the children of the world?  The answer is something close to \\"The Avengers, but with Holiday figures\\" and is just as entertaining, leading to one of the year's most surprisingly good films.<br /><br />In a world where the world's most famous holiday figures work to protect children and keep them happy, a great threat has emerged...a mysterious figure known as Shade, who seeks to destroy the guardians and the children they protect.  The guardians' only hope is to enlist mythical figure Jack Frost...but even together, can they turn the tide against a world that may no longer believe in them?<br /><br />Despite the marketing campaign that portrays Guardians as a typical, sugar-coated cartoon for the kiddies (and in some ways it is, with lots of jokes, bright colors, and a message about the magic of believing), what's most surprising is the adult themes hidden within the rather-simple story, revolving around an exploration of faith and belief in things you can't see.  The main character, Jack Frost, is the perfect anti-hero: he may be mischievous and fun-loving, but beneath it all is a confused individual who spends most of the film begging an unseen deity for answers: Why am I here?  What's my purpose?  Why did you create me?  His search for answers provides Guardians with a powerful emotional core, one that anyone who has struggled with faith can perfectly relate to.<br /><br />While the story is simple, and at times isn't exactly clear on the rules of it's universe (such as what happens to individuals when nobody believes in them) kids will no doubt be excited by all the action and jokes on screen, and adults will find a lot to keep their interest with the grown-up tones, making Guardians one of the biggest surprises of 2012.  Don't let the kiddy look fool you: this is a film with charm, and some genuinely heart-warming moments that stand equal with Pixar at their best.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I bought this book during my trip, I didn't expect the warmth and charming characters from the cover I saw. But once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop reading it. Bringing it up to read anytime I could during my trip and finished it with smiless. Love how the story develops and ends. Also bought this book as a gift for my bestie's BD
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love this game, I play it all the time. I really like playing it when I am sick.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|As far as the movie its self it is one of the best I have ever watched, Now as far as the DVD goes it will not play on my DVD player on my TV. It would only play on my laptop.  So unless you want this I would not purchase this DVD<br /><br />Danny
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I've heard Linkin Park and honestly when I first heard the biggest well known hits from their Hybrid Theory album - \\"Crawling\\" and \\"In The End\\" I wasn't much of a fan. And those tracks got tons of airplay so maybe I was sick of hearing them over and over. It was angry music.<br /><br />Then Linkin Park had tracks in the various Transformers movies and I really liked \\"What I've Done\\". \\"New Divide\\"? Eh, maybe not so much. \\"Iridescent\\"? Not bad.<br /><br />Fast forward a few more years and I tune in to 2012's American Music Awards to see Linkin Park performing \\"Burn It Down\\" and I really liked it. The rap part, the beat, the strong vocals, the lyrics. I downloaded the album and tho there are a few tracks I find myself skipping, overall I really enjoy this album. So much so that I've downloaded their other major albums A Thousand Suns, Meteora, Hybrid Theory and Minutes to Midnight. Consider me a new fan. I enjoy this album, and look forward to going back into their earlier albums. Yeah, I'm late to this dance, but better late than never.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|It's typical Disney but the family loved it.  What else is there to say?  Apparently, six more words are required.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|the graphics in this are like nothing I've. ever seen. for this type of game anyway.The story line is also incredibly interesting (disappearances for over 80 years!).
B00005MJ06|5.0|Recently seen &#34; Jersey Boys &#34; and reminded us how much we enjoyed their sound, this CD had all the great hits, by the original band,the Play tells their story,but we wanted songs the way we remembered them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Did wonders for our marriage. My husband and I read this together. We couldnt put it down, looking forward to the next book...
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son says its the best one yet. It's like being right there. I would definitely recommend this to all who like the original Angry Birds.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|The whole story could have fitted in to one volume. I got the gist of the story early on,and a lot of padding went into the writing of the  tale. Of course Ana was a young naive girl and full of desire,but really it was drawn out ,her naivety ,that is! I am sure in this day and age things are VERY different to this tale!
B006Z1XY7E|5.0|This is a fantastic album that reminds me of Sting and Danny Elfman all at the same time... wonderful and well worth a listen!
B001HBYHFA|4.0|A great follow up -,original series prematurely terminated - this closed the holes -  Watch the anniversary show on cables- science network
B008IYSMLY|4.0|Good season and no problems streaming the episodes. so I need 12 more words it was a killer season of Dexer
B005D63ICI|5.0|I have long been a Dexter fan and with the addition of Julia Stiles, you can't go wrong. I loved this season because there was such drama, understanding, chemistry. It would be nice for that to happen for Dexter, he has always been seeking a kindred spirit.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books there fantastic and when i found the box set at this great price i couldnt say no
B002APU580|5.0|This particular DVD of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; is perhaps my favorite DVD (movie) of all time!!!<br /><br />The Casting, the Directing, the Script Writing is unbelievably suberb!!!<br /><br />Thanks much to all involved,<br /><br />RBB
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the game.  Even loaded it on my phone to play along with my tablet.  Make sure you have lots of time because you will not want to put it down.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Each one of her CD's gets better and better! There is a beautiful song about losing someone you love, it really touched my heart! A must have for any Pink fan!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|really good movie, I find it a little sad that young people may view this scenario as  possibility in their life
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Anything written by DeMille, I like...and this one is a continum of The Lion....very descriptive of Yemen...a place I REALLY don't want to go .
B004SBX112|4.0|recommend for all those that enjoy playing &#34;angry birds&#34;  it's progressive  starts out slow and easy  and then takes off
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Great music from a master song writer--Bob Dylan. Highly recommended. One of the greatest poets and song writers of all time.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a really good movie with excellent actors. I had heard of Temple Grandin, a professor with Colorado State University, but didn't fully appreciate just a how truly special she was.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Love every song, Adam rocks!!! One more night is my fav, I could dance and clean to that all day long LOL
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Excellent cast, especially Noomi Rapace, with Charlize Theron a convincing bad guy.  Best android yet.  Great suspense as our creators are slowly revealed, then knocked off their pedestal, with room left for a Prometheus II.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|In comparison with his other works, I enjoyed them more.<br />The level of suspense and intrigue were adequate but some of the surprises were not consistent and seemed to be added with no real basis.  I love Dan Brown's writing but this was just another DB formula book as far as the foundation plot goes.  His style makes for easy reading but the plot is a rubber stamp of some of his other works.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love the concept and hope that the show lasts long enough for the writers to fully develop the characters. Casting Lucy as a female Watson is a refreshing twist to a well establish character. I encourage all ages to give this show a chance...
B000002GWJ|5.0|Wonderful music from a master composer and vocalist. One of the greatest singer-song writers of all time. Ranks close to Dylan.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Mumford & Sons is a very unique (at least to me) sound that really shows it's dynamic emotional range.  It can be sad, vengeful, angry, happy, victorious, with all of these feelings very well laid out.  They are a lot of fun to listen to and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00A12Z264|4.0|I liked the last one better, but this one is good don't get me wrong. Just not better than the last.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|You Should Watch All Of Season 2 Its Great Even Though I Purchased 4 It Was Still Awesome Ita Just Awesome lol
B004DEW9L2|5.0|This movie defines the French new wave  --  and the leads are very good looking.  A  must see!  It defines an era.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love the suspense and the merging of the different &#34;non-walker&#34; groups in this episode. It definitely left us wanting more!
B000SZK41M|5.0|Excellent movie. Daughter is a big Alan Rickman fan. He's terrific in this movie, and I can't think of anyone else playing the lead except Bruce Willis.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|VERY USEFUL IN EVERY DAY SMALL ELECTRONICS  FITS MOST OF A GAGETS GOOD PRICE RELIABLE<br />CAME ON TIME. GOOD COMPANY TO DEAL WITH
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you like Grisham's legal thrillers, this is a must read. From the first chapter, I was engrossed in the story. Don't start this one if you need to go to bed early or have a lot to do the next day!
B009YU62H2|5.0|King Animal is another great album from Soundgarden. Its as if they never stopped making music. Highly recommend if your a fan of their previous albums.
B0098460O4|5.0|Swerved into these guys on you tube. They are good; he is amazing.  Bought this on a whim, as it had a nice price.  It just gets better everytime I listen to it.  He is destined to great things, they as a duo will probably continue to due great things.  The quality of the recording  could be better and  they can get overpowered by the music and backround effects, but is still a good listen.  Can tell I really like it as I let it repeat while playing in the car.  Haven't got tired of it yet.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I love this game (color and original) and I play them both a lot. However, I wish with the more difficult puzzles that are much bigger that I could see everything better somehow. It is frustrating to be playing a bigger puzzle and have to enlarge the screen then remember which line you need. If you guess wrong, your whole puzzle is messed up and really difficult to fix. Other than that, I really enjoy this game.
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|Starting last year, I began a new annual tradition of taking my daughter out on a date. Last year I took her out to a restaurant of her choice (McDonalds!), and then to a movie of her choice (Arthur Christmas). I figured this movie would be OK, but not great. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie from start to finish, and it was quite a bit better than expected. Though this is definitely a Christmas movie for kids, it's not the typical Christmas movie. This Santa is a high-tech, modern marvel guru who employs all sorts of gadgets and highly-trained squads of elves to deliver all of the Christmas goodies to the kids. The problem is, Santa is getting old, and it's time for him to choose his successor, and he can't decide which of his sons to pass the mantle to. Both sons have great character qualities that prove them to be deserving, but which one will he choose?<br /><br />A great movie for kids, and one that the adults will likely enjoy, as well.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Reading this Grisham novel is more than just a superb plot, well developed characters -- it's an unexpected adventure. Once you've read the first few pages, you will have a very hard time setting it down. When you think you've got the plot figured out...you didn't! Be warned, it is an adventure.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|After buying some items on amazon I was rewarded a dollar to verbal song on amazon music I went to buy a song with that dollar and halfway through it says I don't have internet when I'm using WiFi I checked and my WiFi was fine so I switched to my 3g and tried it again and it still wouldn't download. So, very frustrated I gave up and just went about my day and two hours later I get two emails one saying I used my reward and another charging me 98 cents. I looked through everything with music and it never downloaded and I have no way of getting the songs unless I bought them again. What a rip off ! If there was a way to retrieved my songs I would be happy but as far as I can tell there isn't :(

B0098VXMNE|4.0|This was a good show! Looking forward to season 3. Liam McIntyre is a good replacement for Andy Whitfield and the story was exciting.

B008QE9VJI|5.0|My husband and I just watched this with our kids (ages 18 and 21) and we loved this movie!  I especially loved this movie because I loved the original daytime show.  I, like Johnny Depp, would run home from school and watch Dark Shadows.  I loved it because it was unique.  Let's face it, TV in the 70's was terrible and Dark Shadows, even though they considered it a soap, was refreshing.  All the actors do an excellent job and the movie is hilarious!  The only way they could have pulled it off was making it a comedy and the only people who could pull that off are Burton and Depp.  I loved the music throughout the movie so much that I immediately bought the soundtrack.  My kids never saw Dark Shadows and they both loved this movie.  I don't think it would have worked if they had done a serious, soapy type movie.  It would have been just another Twilight.  Who needs another Twilight!  If you grew up in the 70's, you will love the way they poked fun of that time.  It was like going down memory lane.  One of my favorite scenes is with Alice Cooper.  I love Alice Cooper and he has a great sense of humor.  They also left it open for a second film.  I hope they do another one soon!  I highly recommend this movie.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|I really don't get all the hype. This show moves at a snails pace and is pretty predictable. It's basically a soap opera with zombies that they drag out as long as possible. Every episode I can't figure out why I keep watching it. I wouldn't continue to give it my time but my girlfriend is always bugging me about it. She likes it because &#34;it's filmed in Atlanta&#34;.
B00A12VW86|4.0|This was a solid release by Green Day. I feel like there are some songs here and on UNO that would not have made the cut if they had decided to only release one album. A lot of places are comparing DOS to Foxboro Hottubs and I can see the similarities however they really pull off the sound here where as I felt things where simply out of place on the Foxboro Hottubs album. Overall I enjoyed album and am looking forward to TRE
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie was just as fun to watch as the first. Campy yes, but just a pleasure to see all the &#34;hero's&#34; of yesteryear all together!! Great Movie!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|So good that I plan to read it again in case I missed something . His books are always exciting and I read everything he writes.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|my daughter, my husband and i loved this movie. we would rec-amend the brave to our family and friends.  thanks
B005LAIHZE|5.0|My husband and I just watched this with our kids (ages 18 & 21).  We love this movie!!  I wasn't sure what to expect Lincoln as a vampire hunter.  Is it going to be cheesy?  I am personally getting tired of vampires.  I heard it was a great book and my 21 year old son could not wait to see it.  I was shocked how good this movie is and they actually made it believable that Lincoln was a vampire hunter.  The actor who portrays Abe Lincoln, young and old, does an excellent job.  Dominic Cooper is amazing!  This movie has an excellent cast, great writing, direction and fast paced.  The stunt work is outstanding.  This movie is very entertaining and they do a great job with the special effects and make-up.  I was so impressed with the costumes, set designs and props.  I was shocked to see that it didn't do well at the box office.  I remember Conan O'Brien raving about this movie.  I wish I had seen this movie in the theater.  I highly recommend this movie!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|A lot of thought clearly went into this, and none of it wasted.  Game is an excellent addition - all the character and fun of Angry Birds and cleverly incorporated elements of Star Wars, even including new SW-inspired birds and piggies.  Great game.
B00A135YUW|5.0|Every song on this album is just purely beautiful. Buy the whole thing, no doubt. Very similar to her Born to Die album, although a little slower.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game, and it's good for all ages!!! I took off a start because it is hard to draw on my cell phone, but drawing on the Kindle is much better! I play with the kids and grandkids alike. Fun and easy! The only other drawback is that sometimes you might get a random person with a less than desireable name. No problem, just delete the person from your play list!

B005LAIHY0|5.0|My husband and I just watched this with our kids (ages 18 & 21) and we all loved the movie.  Ridley Scott did an excellent job.  Excellent special events.  Visually gorgeous movie.  As usual Michael Fassbender is excellent and funny.  The whole cast does a great job.  Big fan of Idris Elba or as my daughter and I like to call him the first black James Bond, if Daniel Craig retires.  That's if the Bond family has the balls to do it.  I like that this movie has some humor thrown in the right spots.  Some of the reviews said that this movie is hard to understand.  Not sure what these people were talking about.  All of us understood the movie just fine.  Ridley did an excellent job setting the stage for Alien.  I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews and bought this movie.  Highly recommend.

B003CH9PTU|5.0|I'm not going to say a lot about this because it's already been said. Just wanted to log my vote for this series as one of the all-time television greats, right up there with the Sopranos, NYPD Blue, The Wire and Homicide: Life on the Streets. And since this is the first season, this is where you've gotta get the ball rolling.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief offers a new, heart -breaking and thought provoking take on World War II which makes for a fantastic book. Though some may find the narration difficult to follow and the German words confusing, I think that it makes the book even more gripping.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is not only entertaining but it also showed something very important.

My husband and I both truly enjoyed this movie.
B0000062S0|5.0|I don't get the mediocre reviews, this is an excellent album.  Superb guitar work and the vocals are catchy.  More of a mellow feel, with edgy guitar tones. I'm fully satisfied.  Buy it for yourself, and its cheap enough to make a nice gift to someone.

I really hope this movie gets nominated and takes home a couple oscars because it definitely deserves them.

I love this film and will definitely purchase it on blu-ray!

1781006849|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3AETXPOXWV420]]<br />TO MARITIME AND SHIPPING LAW PRACTITIONERS: AN EXAMINATION OF PIRACY AND ITS PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Piracy on the high seas is an international scandal and a scourge, primarily it affects the ASEAN countries, although any vessel from anywhere and its passengers and crew can - and have been - victimized.  The need for an effective legal framework to combat such crimes, is urgent, hence the timeliness and utility of this book published recently by Elgar.<br /><br />So what can be done about piracy?  This book examines the issues and suggests at least partial solutions.  The editors have compiled a roster of informed, thoughtful and thoroughly researched viewpoints from a nine-member team of experts in the fields of law of the sea, transnational crimes and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations).<br /><br />By way of reminder, ASEAN comprises Brunei Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.<br /><br />To date there has apparently been no study on whether ASEAN member states can construct, so to speak, effective legal frameworks in line with relevant international law to arrest, prosecute and punish those who commit maritime crimes.  This seems to be at the root of the difficulties faced by the international community in dealing with piracy off the coast of Somalia, for example, for at least the past five years.<br /><br />While there are a number of books available written mainly from historical, political and socio-economic perspectives, this book, as the editors point out, is `the first to look strictly at the legal dimension of maritime crimes with an ASEAN focus'. In the meantime, efforts have been made to discuss how ASEAN states might move toward harmonizing their domestic laws in order to combat more effectively the problem of maritime crimes. Not only does this book explore the problems involved, it suggests certain suitable steps that may be taken to possibly resolve them.<br /><br />As the waters off South East Asia are crucial strategically for the international business community, this book is an important acquisition for practitioners specializing in maritime law, comparative law and/or international commercial law. Copiously footnoted, with a detailed index, the book also offers researchers almost limitless avenues for further inquiry. The publication date is 2012.es this book explore the problems involved, it suggests certain suitable steps that may be taken to possibly resolve them.<br /><br />As the waters off South East Asia are crucial strategically for the international business community, this book is an important acquisition for practitioners specializing in maritime law, comparative law and/or international commercial law.

0156027321|4.0|The item was delivered on time, and I have been anxiously waiting to read this novel.  I must say it was well worth every minute of waiting, and I highly recommend it to most people.  However, there are some concepts that may come as too &#34;out there&#34; for other people's taste.  The reason for the four stars is because of the quality that was delivered.  I expected wear and tear in some areas, but did not expect there to be all of these hard to take off stickers that cover the front and back cover.

Also, liked that Lea Michelle got to strut her vocal talent in the movie.<br /><br />VERY GOOD MOVIE!!!

Now, especially with the advent of auto-enrollment, not to mention an ageing population, economic difficulties and so forth, pensions have now attained more of a position of priority in the public consciousness.<br /><br />Not all that many people out there, however, including more than a few practitioners, fully understand pensions, or pension planning, much less the taxation of pensions.<br /><br />Fortunately, help is at hand via this revealing and enlightening publication from Tolley's which presents all the key information about pensions tax in one volume.<br /><br />Dealing initially with the historical background of pensions tax, author Stephen Ward offers an interesting perspective on the changes introduced by the Finance Act 2011 and indeed the development of the UK pensions tax system through the twentieth century, which in his view, has engendered something of  `a labyrinth of often contradictory rules and regulations'.  He expresses the hope, nonetheless, that the changes to the pensions tax system introduced in 2011 will stand the test of time.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, this latest edition for 2012-13 has expanded the previous 2011-12 edition by about 25 per cent and includes a new chapter on  -- you guessed it -- auto-enrollment.  `Although not strictly a pensions taxation matter,' remarks the author, `this is perhaps one of the most important developments in UK pensions in modern times'.<br /><br />We are tempted to say here that this succinct comment by an acknowledged expert in pensions consultancy does put auto-enrollment in its proper perspective as a positive development in the ongoing evolution of pensions.<br /><br />Despite the complexity of this area of law, this book is easy to read and easy to navigate, with such features as a detailed table of contents, comprehensive index and tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases.<br /><br />Usefully, each of the fifteen chapters starts with an introduction prior to a more detailed explanation of its subject matter.  There are six appendices as well, dealing with such areas as  pension, lump sum and death benefit rules, HMRC guidance and much more besides.<br /><br />In all, the book examines a vast range of pensions tax issues, from the pensions tax rules applicable to contributions, to the pension fund itself and the effects of relevant legislation on these and other factors.<br /><br />The author's stated aim is to place all the key information about pensions tax in a way that makes it accessible not just to practitioners, but journalists and anyone interested in how the pensions tax system works, which, ideally, should include those responsible for policy and legislation.  Anyone working with, or interested in pensions taxation, should add this book to their professional library.pective as a positive development in the ongoing evolution of pensions.<br /><br />Despite the complexity of this area of law, this book is easy to read and easy to navigate, with such features as a detailed table of contents, comprehensive index and tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases.<br /><br />Usefully, each of the fifteen chapters starts with an introduction prior to a more detailed explanation of its subject matter.

B0082PQ8KQ|5.0|This is so well written in a narrative style and yet it has details on medical research that are sharp and focused.

0754543366|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moDV4XYUVHUC85]]<br /><br />AT THE LOWEST COST<br />NOW IN THE LATEST EDITION FOR 2012-13<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Whether you're an accountant, or lawyer specializing in tax advice, or a private individual concerned with financial planning for those of your personal and family resources that constitute an estate, you really do need this book, now in the latest updated edition from LexisNexis.<br /><br />Bearing in mind the complexity of this area of law, the book offers many benefits, not the least of which is its clarity, in other words a plain English approach illustrated by any number of practical examples and case studies.  Its aim is to assist the reader in achieving the most desirable results at the lowest cost.<br /><br />One glance at the table of contents will indicate the scope of the book which covers everything you need to know in relation to tax planning, including trust law, settlements, offshore trusts, insurance pensions, the family home, the family business, the family farm, woodlands, charitable donations and heritage property.<br /><br />If you argue that estate planning is actually life planning, it must also take account of virtually all aspects of life that can impact on personal or family wealth, from children and grandchildren to matrimonial breakdown, to pensions and post-death estate planning.<br /><br />Practitioners with international clients will appreciate the extensive chapters on, for example, offshore trusts, UK domicillaries investing abroad and of course, the overseas client and the internationally mobile.<br /><br />As this volume is an update of the previous well regarded and well received edition, note that it contains much new material in line with the numerous changes to tax legislation that have recently taken place.  Full account is taken of Finance Act 2012 as well as the new reduced rate of inheritance tax on charitable bequests and the proposed statutory residence test.  The effect of recent case law on estate planning is also considered.<br /><br />No doubt with a view to making the principles and practice demonstrated in the book even clearer,  a typical, well, imagined example of the progress of a typical life is included as a final chapter on the life of one `Henry Clerestory'. Fascinating reading this - and referred to as A Lifetime of Planning - a Case Study'.  Henry's financial affairs from his birth in 1987 to his eventual demise in 2072 are painstakingly documented.  Would that everyone could plan so precisely - but this hypothetical illustration of a life well lived and sensibly organized is nothing of not thought provoking.<br /><br />For those in any way involved in estate planning, whether practitioners or interested private individuals, this book certainly provides a reliable approach to the complexities of the process and of course the need for forward planning.  As you would expect, the book contains extensive research resources including tables of statues, cases and a detailed index at the back of no less than 25 pages.  The publication date is August 2012.nd the proposed statutory residence test.  The effect of recent case law on estate planning is also considered.<br /><br />No doubt with a view to making the principles and practice demonstrated in the book even clearer,  a typical, well, imagined example of the progress of a typical life is included as a final chapter on the life of one `Henry Clerestory'. Fascinating reading this - and referred to as A Lifetime of Planning - a Case Study'.  Henry's financial affairs from his birth in 1987 to his eventual demise in 2072 are painstakingly documented.  Would that everyone could plan so precisely - but this hypothetical illustration of a life well lived and sensibly organized is nothing of not thought provoking.<br /><br />For those in any way involved in estate planning, whether practitioners or interested private individuals, this book certainly provides a reliable approach to the complexities of the process and of course the need for forward planning.  As you would expect, the book contains extensive research resources including tables of statues, cases and a detailed index at the back of no less than 25 pages.  The publication date is August 2012.
B0000027G6|5.0|This soundtrack never gets old. Just wonderful. I could listen to it all day but my roommates will hate me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because of the many levels and the challenges in each level. Keeps the mind working, and trying to get ahead of them is good.

B007WMR9YE|5.0|This book is the best one I've read in a while. Sarah captures your heart and the author keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I deeply suggest this book.
B009329ZF2|2.0|This movie was way too slow and action was pretty bad the whole story did not make lot of sense and we where not very impressed with , felt like waste of money
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great ! Loved watching! I recommend watching and using amazon for quick upload. FAst and affordable instant watch when you want.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|awesome, just a little bit too much focus on the girly stuff but aside from that it rocked mission impossible socks
B0021L9ME6|4.0|If you like or enjoy the batman series like I do, you will want this one for your collection. Loved it.

B003DNN0L2|5.0|One of Wes Anderson's best. There is a perfect balance of Anderson humor with the classic plot of Fantastic Mr. Fox that kids will enjoy too.
1594744475|5.0|Brought this book for my grandkids.  We also purchased the items that makes the food beautiful.  The end product of the items in the book is unreal.  It makes you feel like a great chef.  My daughter-in-law receive great reviews.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Their music and Chinos voice was perfect as always. I really enjoyed the album and the mix of kind of music that they was playing. I love this band.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I find this just as challenging as my 4 year old.  We have fun playing it together.  I would recommend ths app for children that love a challenge.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was good. Very cool twist. I'd talk about it but I don't want to spoil the movie! Worth it!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|how do you fly over mountains in the invincible. great game though any help would be greatly appreciated thank you
B00544L9EI|5.0|Every song is awesome in its on way. My fav is the &#34;intro song (yeah, crazy huh)&#34;, &#34;lighters&#34;, &#34;Echo&#34;, & &#34;Living Proof&#34;. The others are not far behind. The beats are as great as the lyrics. I can truly hear the amazing amount of effort put into this album. &#34;I'm on Everything&#34; has got a funny beat and chorus. lol
B005K17RU0|3.0|the app works great like the radar maps and all that, but had to use another town nearby for location because it wouldn't let me enter my own.tried a few times would get so far then it would change it guess it wanted me to live someplace else.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I THOUGHT IT WOULD EXPLAIN HOW TO USE THE CAMERA PART OF MY KINDLE AND IF I COULD TAKE PICTURES WITH THIS NEW PRODUCT.  IT DID NOT AND I STILL DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE USE OF THIS FEATURE.
B009AZZEU2|2.0|Soundgarden is one of my top five favorite bands, and will remain so even after this lethargic return.  While 1000 years better than most of the garbage out there today (which isn't saying much), this is simply not up to their standard.  I wasn't expecting a retread of earlier work, however, this album completely lacks their signature sonic 'wall of sound' which all the other albums have.  As different as they are to one another, their dynamic sound is what connects them.  This album is just weak and powerless by comparison.<br /><br />The only song that truly captures SG is \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" which incorporates slow, heavy, dirge-like riffs, dynamic layering, and Cornell's signature wail.  Could have easily been something off either Badmotorfinger or Down on the Upside.  If most of the album had been like this, it could have been a damn-near masterpiece.<br /><br />Perhaps they can't be blamed after staying away for so long.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|cool game. my son really enjoys it. great graphics. fun web slinging action. great price got it for only 99 cents.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is a pretty fast paced page turner. Even if the trial pieces could have been dry, the author let you in on it, letting you know even before it started that it was going to happen. I was not sure the last one I read could be topped, but it was.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was recommended by a coworker and I love it.  It is easy to learn and gets more difficult as you go along.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent follow-up to the first book. I Thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you enjoy historical fiction, you won't be disappointed with this read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton's books are the best.  They pull you in right from the beginning and keep you till the end.  Her time periods are great.  Can't wait for her next book!
B007T99ENE|4.0|This one was slow at first and I wasn't sure I was going to get into it but I eventually did and was generally intrigued by the plot twists.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is an amazing book that past generations have always enjoyed and future generations will always enjoy. It really show the true meaning of Christmas.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|i tried to watch it twice. snoozefest.  daniel craig is hot. the theme song sucks. the bond girl's name is dumb. (strawberry fields? really??) meh. that is all.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It is true to the Disney tradition.  Princess has a delema, and needs to figure out how to solve it.  Everything neatly wrapped up by 5 min. before the end of the movie.  I recommend it for girls esp. ages 5-10
0312383347|5.0|My friends and I are reading the complete series.  Particularly love the &#34;Between the Plums&#34; for their seasonal theme.  Keeping up with Stephanie's life is always a good time.  Sometimes have to reread the paragraphs due to laughing too hard.
B004GYY714|5.0|Easily to find stations everywhere from local to other countries great application and very useful when you dont hace access to radio
B009VB7QQA|2.0|I didn't reallly enjoy this movie.  Not really a vampire movie kind of guy, but like Lincoln so I thought I would check it out.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except those that like vampire movies.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Love this movie as much now as I did the first time I saw it. One  time where I enjoyed the movie as much as the book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|the game deleted after a day and i got it agsin but it deleted the next day jt is a fun gsmd though
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Tried this for my daughter n its too complicated for her but I am now playing it. Fun for all ages apparently.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Special effects were good.  Story line was reasonable.  Ending left open for a sequel? Streaming was flawless and sound was really good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The amount of training they do is incredible. Their families lose so much of their time with them. The dedication on their part is hard to comprehend.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I thought this was pretty good.  There was enough intensity and adventure to keep me interested.  I thought the quality of the acting and cinematography was very good.  Story is a little weak but I thought it was worth seeing.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|It just didn't speak to me,  it's taking to long for anything to happen. this is the first book i've read by Patricia Cornwell.  will try something else later.
0143034901|5.0|I bought both the English and Spanish versions of this glorious book and am reading them side by side.<br />A great Spanish teacher suggested I do so. What a pleasure. Even just a paragraph a week invites beautiful<br />images to roam your mind.
0385474547|5.0|i can read it over and over .love the story especially the characters and the expressions he used.<br /> excellent work by Ahinua Acheba.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|i love these games so much. this is crazy. my kids call me the gamer of all times. thank you for your games
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|When this Seal died in Afghanistan a little bit of American died with him. It is had to believe that these individuals do what they do.
1400052181|5.0|I really enjoyed reading through this book and learning about racism and ethics, and how it all playes a role in medical science. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about human cell development and ethics from this time period! It was hard to put this one down!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn delivers the best Mitch Rapp sequel to date. Mitch is what I hope American men really are-not the squemish pansys we see on the nightly news!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|A must have for anyone who is a Taylor Swift fan or someone looking for a younger pop & county singer!  Great for all ages.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart can still rock his sexy voice on his first Christmas CD. Most of the songs are pretty mellow and easy to listen to. He picks up the pace a little with Red-Suited Superman which is one of my favorites on this album. I also loved the bagpipes on Auld Lang Syne. A wonderful addition to my Christmas album collection.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Not one of Disney's best, but certainly watchable.<br />Compelling characters, beautiful scenery.<br />The only complaint was that the story line is a little thin.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book came highly recommended and it did not let me down.  I, in turn, have recommended it to all of my friends. We would love to see a film made of this story.
0061124958|5.0|Charlotte's Web has always been one of my personal favorites as a child. Now, I have shared the story of Fern, Wilbur, Charlotte and many other great characters with my children. This classic tale of friendship and love will melt the biggest of hearts. The Zuckerman farm will never be the same after the introduction of  \\"SOME PIG\\" (Wilbur) thanks to the help of Charlotte the spider. This tale deals with the realistic forces of nature as well as the unrealistic points of the farm animals speaking like humans to one another. However, parents must be advised this book does have the heart-ship of losing a loved one in it. All-in-all, this is a classic story you do not want to miss!
B0031QNDUO|5.0|Miracle on 34th Street is a classic Christmas film.  To be able to view this story at your own descretion is great and to see again Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, Edmund Gwenn adn Natalie Wood as a little girl is priceless.  There is a Santa Claus
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Excelente product, good packaging, received on time. I have used it for more than a month and works like a charm
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I don't know;  this is a gift that was requested.  I'll have to find out from the receiver.  Thank you.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked it much better than the last two.  Back to what Grishm does best.  I would expect a sequal to this one.
B0087K3VTW|4.0|Robin Sloan has done an excellent job of creating a cast of characters who vary in age from late teens/early twenties to octegenerarians, all of whom share in a desire to solve a riddle about sustaining life, using both old and new technologies. As Mr. Sloan pointed out in a CBC interview I heard prior to purchasing his book, whether we're discussing the print techniques of the earliest bookmakers or current e-books, all of it is relevant in today's society.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i thought it was going to be long and boring, but it was fun... well it still is, amazing. you will love love LOVE IT!!!
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Ridiculous movie.  They say they spent $1 trillion on this mission yet hire the most incompetent crew ever.  This movie really sucks,
1555175163|5.0|my husband has read this book over and over..i knew he would love it!! thanks again for such fast and great service!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great app. My children and I love the variety of games and you can always progress by getting more points. Kids and I have fun playing this app overall.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I gave this show a 5 star because I could not give it a 6. Visual effects are awesome. The plot is very good.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|If you liked the previous movies you will love this one as well! Definetaly will be purchasing it for my Disney library!
B003B02O14|5.0|Each book he writes just gets better than the last one he wrote.  I never can wait till he writes another one.  He is great.....
0525478817|4.0|I loved it because The story sucked me in right from the beginning. Also, there was no sugar coating anything, especially when it came to cancer and death.
B004X4QW42|5.0|great fast service thank you!!! we really enjoy the movie and the quality was awesome!! love this!!!<br />we will order more in the future!!! thanks again!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really good, they always keep you guessing who is going to live and who will die each and every episode.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|And I am not referring to the plot. Kudos to Mr. Grisham for creating a unique style within the mystery genre but this effort was on auto-pilot. One only has to read the author's note at the end which is an admission of sorts. The least enjoyable aspect was the main character. In his past novels the Grisham formula includes a main character that you empathize with and root for. In The Racketeer, I was actually hoping that the plot would see Malcolm Bannister get duped. I expect the author will return to form and may even innovate again.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds & I love Star Wars so to have them together is amazing!  The app runs smoothly without any hiccups,  and I can't stop playing it!
B003B02PEU|5.0|You can always count on John Grisham's books to be great reading.  His books are a must read.  I get all his books
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is really fun and kids all ages can play and still have fun. it isn't very violent either so my parents like it too.
030758836X|5.0|Was reading this at red lights...couldn't put it down....what a page turner.  Twisted and delicious!  I think the title has more meaning once you read the book...a great read!
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Great music!  It reminds me of a station I listen to years ago, but better choices.  I have listened to other inernet stations, but<br />always come back to jazzradio.com. It has artist I know and many I never heard before, all good.
B000GWE44U|5.0|King may not like Kubrick's interpretation of his novel, but this is one of the best movies ever made. A must see!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great vacation read. I will be getting the third to finish the trilogy. Kept me flipping through the pages all the way through.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I liked this movie becaus it was filmed in my hometown; Tatum is a cutie; talented actor . Id recommend as a cute girls night -  in chick flick.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|A little &#34;out there&#34; for me. Love the cast though. Rented it since it was filmed in my town. The feel of the movie was awkward.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|The game will not download after many attempts.  This greatly disappointed my grandson who had earn it as a reward.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This was an interesting story.  But it failed to pull me in.  But I'm glad a watched it but I will not watch it again.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|Cute game. I downloaded it when it was Amazon's free app of the day; I wouldn't have paid for it (but I don't pay for any apps).<br /><br />Starts off easy, but I'm stuck on level 4 of the &#34;daytime&#34; section. Can't get past it!
B0053O89KG|5.0|A series within a series. Each episode brings something new on the already expected detective work yet the relationship between the writer and the detective keeps growing to an expected but not fullfilled state.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I LOVE this app dont get me wrong, but come on! Everythings costs cash. Personally I dont want to spend 3 bucks on an app just to figureiut it costs MORE money to get other places, I mean path of th jedi come on the falcon prices are plain insane. Rovio is not going toward bankruptism. Other than that this game is amazing.
030758836X|5.0|I ordered this as we were reading it for my book group.  It is a great book - lots of twists and turns - and we had a lively discussion.  The book came quickly and was a good value.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|I chose this movie because it was clear through even the previews, to be humorous, yet serious- and I love that.<br />It surpassed my expectations and I truly enjoy watching every minute of this film.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|LOVE THIS!!!! My Daughter will be so excited for CHRISTMAS!!!! I have not seen this movie myself and pretty excited to see it!!!!!!
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Love this band! It's worth listening. Payphone is my favourite but the whole album is more than enjoyable. Please Maroon 5 continue bringing great music for years to come.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The children loved each movie in its time. I'll keep this set for the grandchildren that are too young to enjoy them now. Hopefully, they'll have a great time as their parents did in their time.
B009K45Y62|4.0|i read the comics first.movies are allways a mixture of stories from the comics.that is unless a director thinks our boys need nipples or codpieces.batman stories are kinda like star trek.only the people that wont be in a story later will die.the villians will continue to come back forever.therefore appearing in batmans life over and over.the comics reflect this,and theres no reason the movies shouldnt do this too.as each writer and artist gives us a new tangent on the joker im allways frothing for the experience.i like the darker batman...he has to be that way.i like new stories that are connected to my comics.bring on all the new stuff!!! dont wait for the justice league just turn batman around by 2014!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead has it all. Every season just gets better and better! You really care about the characters and you really want everyone to survive. Great writing!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. The updates keep the game fresh. The levels are a challenge and rival suduku. Highly recommended!
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I tried it on a Toshiba excite 7.7 running ice creme sandwich. Works great.. It is a shame play store doesn't have this..
0316228532|4.0|I was curious to see if Rowling's writing style would carry over into a more adult content.  I was happy to see that, although it doesn't &#34;sweep you up&#34; in quite the same way as the Potter series did, it still captures  and holds your attention and makes you want to know more about this widely divergent cast of characters. ( I see sequels a'coming!)
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|We used these to decorate the princess playroom and they are just the right size and plenty of them for scenes on two walls
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob Dylan has delivered for about 40 years (more maybe?). TEMPEST is as unique and moving as the best of the rest. &#34;Desquane Whistle&#34; is a lilting, toe-tapping up-tempo kick-in-the-ass healer type of song for our troubled times. A sweet good ol' American tune that can pull us all together, (if only for a few minutes). The title song TEMPEST is that very special and rare occurrence when an great artists' varied powers of expression coalesce into a whole that is more than the sum of its parts resulting in a masterpiece of art that touches the soul. This one song is worth the price of the whole album. But don't be chincey and just buy this one tune on your ipod you will miss too much. Live a little and listen carefully to all of this American Masters latest offering to us, you will be very challenged and not at all disappointed.
B007PMO02A|1.0|I bought this because I had heard a few songs with her on them that I tought were pretty good. Sadly when she is by herself it isn't worth listening to.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|the movie starts off with a major serious tone. a family movie with serious tones.<br />but later it makes a move for the slightly better atleast for the more funny..reminding me of the old<br />Disney film ... Brother Bear.. it's definatly not Pixar's best effort but it's better than a lot of other crap out<br />there by other studios live action or animated... but be aware there are some butt shots. kids might find it<br />funny. adults found it shocking...
B007RAJVR4|5.0|Love the ideology behind his lyrics. I find it soothing and uplifting, love to listen to it on my morning walk...helps me get the day started in the right mindset!
B002VECM6S|5.0|My review is very late since I bought this ages ago.  But, if you have not seen this yet -where have you been?  Sandra Bullock who stars in it, asked three times to get out of the role because she did not feel her acting skills were good enough.  Well, she stuck with it and surprise, she walked off with the Academy Award.  This is a must see, but by now you probably have seen it on TV.  A very moving story about a disadvantaged black boy who overcomes hideous life challenges and is taken in by a rich family.  That's just the start.  You have to see it - my words are lame.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|It was a pleasant romantic comedy about two people being friends with benefits. The chemistry between them is quite good and interesting. They ultimately do fall for each other, though only after the drama surrounding it. A good movie though.
B005K01VZS|2.0|Boaring,was ok at time,sometime more intresting then other.<br />toward the end i was still reading,but begging for it to be over all ready:(
B006Z1XY7E|2.0|Not really unexpected but other than his hit everything is forgetable. I'm just glad I bought it when it was on sale rather than for full price.
B009VB97EY|1.0|If there was less than 1 star that would be my vote. Good dancing by Tatum - horrible story- falls in with Showgirls bad!
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I'm an Aerosmith fan because they are phenomenal musicians: pure American hard rock bones with blues running in their veins.<br /><br />As a fan of their musicianship I've appreciated most of whatever they've created. Tracks like the hard rockin \\"Walk on Down\\", the swagger of \\"Round & Round\\", the nod to the blues in \\"Hangman Jury\\" and the funky edge on \\"Just Push Play\\" all showcase Bad Boy versatility, and are no less Aerosmith than their earlier, mostly hard rock tracks. For me, Tyler's vocals were never more amazing than on \\"Dude\\" (Ka-ka-ka-ka-kow-kow-kow-kkkkkkkkkow!) Come on - who else could ad lib something so wildly original and make you love it! And Tom's bass in \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" is just as silky as it is in \\"Sweet Emotion\\".<br /><br />Having said, I was hoping this CD would be a killer mix of their over arching spectrum. I was so looking forward to music that I just couldn't stop playing. \\"Another Dimension\\" is just not the brilliant blend I was hoping for.<br /><br />I really like Carrie Underwood; her pure country, power house vocals are incredible, and she stands toe to toe with Tyler. The two of them together in a Super Bowl half time, or Grammy performance, Yes...but for us true Blue Army soldiers - Carrie just don't belong on no Aerosmith album.<br />It may have been more congruous to feature \\"Can't Stop Lovin You\\" on her CD.<br /><br />Was this track included strictly for cross over commercial appeal? If so, should we blame the Boys for trying to reach a different audience? You can't argue with the success generated by their collab with Run. Genre agility is Aerosmith, and has helped them maintain legit rock star status for over 40 years. I totally get that, but still think the duet with Carrie in the middle of what feels like a hard rock playlist is one of the reasons this CD is a little off dead center (that track will probably end up being huge ;0)<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because even though I won't crank most of the tracks or add them to my Aerosmith Hall of Fame, I am a big fan who was shamelessly desperate for new music.y Aerosmith Hall of Fame, I am a big fan who was shamelessly desperate for new music.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|This book is extremely well written and easy to read. It is very intricate as far as story lines go, and I loved every bit of it.
0345803507|5.0|Good book it your not too much of a prude, you don't mind explicit lanuage or detail into some sex acts.
B00867GJYK|3.0|I had not realised just how poorly this film has aged. Technically it is outstanding but the plot is purile, the humour flat and the dialogue plain cheesy. Compared to the sharpness of earlier masterpieces such as The Jungle Book, Robin Hood and the recent Rango this is just weak. I could hardly get through to the end. 5 for technology 2 for storyline.
B002OQT928|5.0|I love it. Kids love it. Hilarious movie. So entertaining ;) we can watch I over and over nd it's still funny
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Didn't care for this .There was alot of action but I didn't like the &#34;dog eat dog&#34; message.Plus I felt there was to much build up about it. When I finally watched it I thought &#34;what was the big deal?&#34;  Not a favorite . guess I should have read the book because the book is always better
B006TX276C|4.0|very happy with this compilation have been a fan since Japan, found a couple of cuts I had not heard before and overall a well put together cd.
B005KELR3A|5.0|Easy to move the kindle in and out of the sleeve while still being trim and compact--perfect fit.  Zipper seems sturdy and the whole package is very easy to carry in a tote or large handbag.
B003SI5NX0|5.0|I love that you can rent movies like this because its rare you can find movies like this to rent anymore.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I don't enjoy games but I got sucked into playing this for nearly an hour! So don't start it unless you have the time to kill.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie. Loved the animation and humor that was brought to the screen. The story line preached more to the mother/daughter relationship than anything else.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Beautifully done animation,great characters,lots of laughs and a few tears. Although some of the story line threw me off a bit. I guess that is what comes with fairy tales. I would however say I enjoyed it and if you have not seen it -see it.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|i liked this game at first didn't even mind buying gems. my problem was while in design mode you touch wrong item once and you could loose 100 gems. i lost 100 gems on unnecessary money i had over 100,000. 24 gems on mystery box item. 49 gems on unlocking next level when i had about 10 more stars to get to the next level. it should say are you sure you want to spend gems. i will not be buying anymore gems.
B008COD5OO|5.0|I first read in the NY Times that the reviewer loved the movie as a viewer, but it made him cringe as a parent and homeowner.  I couldn't agree more. Outrageous.  Hilarious. I put it in the same category as animal House, Caddyshack, Vacation, Bad Santa and American Pie.  A modern classic!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've had this app for awhile now on my Samsung Gallaxy 5.0 Player. I really like knowing exactly how much battery life is left for different activities: 5 hours for music, 3 hours for apps, 2 hours for video, etc. I highly recommend this app!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I'd really like this morning if it did two things better:<br /><br />1) The pages would lay out correctly instead of having the text bunch up.<br />2) If every time I open the app, it wasn't still inside a book I finished.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this show restored my faith in TV since the end of LOST.  I am on the edge of my seat with every episode.  it is consistently well written, shot, and directed.
1400069289|4.0|I learned a lot from this book because the author presented the content in a systematic and interesting manner. Sometimes we are not aware of the habits we have that cripple our efforts to achieve our goals.If we are able to change the routine and identify the source of our \\"cravings\\" then we can turn bad habits into good ones.
B004LQGXPA|4.0|This movie gives much information on the best General that has ever lived.  His story is a story that should remain alive down through the years and is a study all military officers should do.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|I never could have dreamed that the story would be this great from the previews.  The marketing was terrible!  The worst since the original Arthur movie with Dudley Moore.
B003SI84D6|5.0|Overall great movie. Plot line is an easy one to follow without all that cheesy action and lost romance that modern movies have.
B004FOA84A|1.0|if you're looking for something challenging don't look here. easy to figure out, short, shallow story line. don't waste your time, even if finishing this &quot;mystery&quot; takes no time at all.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game no complaints. I really have enjoyed all the GameCircus apps. I love that you can shake the coins once you collect enough power.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great intense television show! Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Highly recommended to whom ever has watched the last two seasons.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This season isn't my favorite but it is pretty good! :)!! Great for when you just want to relax and enjoy a simple show with a lot of character
B0083GQKQG|4.0|A bit uneven but a unique story about a topic rarely discussed--especially in a movie!  There are moments in the film that could have moved it along a bit faster but het--it's good!
0061148512|4.0|I was required to read this book for a college class I am taking but still would have enjoyed the book regardless of whether or not I was taking the class.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy to read, great plot, amazing suspense, keeps you hooked till the last page, I could not stop reading, it's an awesome book
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Thought this was an excellent book for book club discussion.  My group got deeply into which is the better parent---the one who refuses to see any flaw in his child or the one who might consider his child a murderer.  It isn't the best-written book in the world, and some of his legal facts were off, but it passed the ultimate test for me--it grabbed my attention and kept me  up half the night so I could find out. How<br />it ended.  I vote it &#34;a good read&#34; and that's the bottom line for me.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|I'm still looking for the original version of &#34;Separate Lives&#34;.  The one included here is some concert-recording, and I found it to be painfully slow, and sappy, unlike the song most will remember.  Other than that mis-step, I'd recommend the album to any fan.  I grew up with Genesis and Phil solo, and loved so much of his work - his music would be well-represented in the soundtrack to my life!
0425263916|5.0|Loved this sequel to Bared To You. Kept my interest throughout.  Looking forward to e<br />Entwined In You.  Great story
B008SOS63S|4.0|Is it blues or rock? It's a good album with good tunes, some of the vocals need to go away though. Still one of the best around, keep searching Joe we're enjoying the ride!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is great. Gets choppy trying to wrap things up but still wonderful. Twisted ending... unlike Katniss in my opinion. Must read trilogy!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Easy to read, great plot, amazing suspense, keeps you hooked till the last page, I could not stop reading, it's an awesome book, I loved the series
B000LYCNJQ|5.0|For a used DVD this item was in excellent condition. My seven year old grandson will love it for Christmas. He is among a whole new generation of fans.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|please tell me they will not make another...  I don't see how they will be able to top these first 3 movies.....
0425263908|4.0|I read this after reading Fifty Shades and was a little disappointed. A little too much bad language at first. But the more I read, the better I liked the book. Good story
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|Good covers of Jimi's best bit the vocals could have benn better. Overall a good music experience that I would recommend to any Gary Moore fan and rock lovers.
1609611543|5.0|I quit wheat in all of its forms on September 16th, 2012 and promptly lost twenty pounds.  It's over two months later and every week a few more ounces disappear.  An easy read with proper footnotes, I bought a copy for my Kindle and another to give away at work.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Decent quality photos and video. The fact that the Kindle Fire HD doesn't have a viewfinder isn't the app's fault, and that is it's only drawback.
B005LAJ1H2|3.0|Bought this for my father. He loves it and marathon watched all of the episodes in one day.<br /><br />I couldn't really get into it though it could just be because I only caught bits and pieces.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|well with all the action stars they got for this movie i was hoping for more action... but the action that was there was great airport scene, I kept thinking where did all the bad guys come from cause the amount that got off the truck is only like 20 men.... but like 100 get killed?!!
B0053O89KG|5.0|It arrived very quickly; many thanks.<br /><br />This is a great season from a great show; with a great season finale.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|No plan B needed, I recommend this album as a good addition to your collection.  Van is a class act and it shows on this album.
1451695195|5.0|I have a collection of maybe a half-dozen NDE books.  I find them fascinating and helpful.  Proof of Heaven is at the top on my list.  Well written by a man you can take to heart.  Purchased a copy for a good friend and we discuss it regularly.
B008B92U32|1.0|It looks terrible way obvious it was cut and paste just dumb.  I could have done better on my own.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|Film was okay. Just okay.<br /><br />I like Daniel Craig, but I thought this role was a little too beneath his talent.<br /><br />Worth watching, but I don't suggest buying it before you've seen it to see if you like it. Netflix it first.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great graphics and scenes and easy to follow. It was extremely enjoyable. Would like to play more games like this.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a great movie for all ages. My littlest one (3) to my oldest (10) loved this movie. I would reccommend it.
B008S847X2|5.0|I was surprised that I really like this album. McLaughlin shows his prowess on this album, very good music. The back up is first class, good mix that blends seamlessly.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I saw the Hugh Laurie special on PBS and was very impressed not only with his musical knowledge, but also his singing and playing of the piano skills (i guess he was really playing the piano on the House episodes). My favorite song is the album title, &#34;Let Them Talk&#34;, but decided to get the whole album because it was hard to decide each song as an individual. Seeing the PBS special adds a lot to the choice of his music. Who would have thought that it would take an Englishman to appreciate the American blues of New Orleans.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Always a pleasure seeing Stan Lee doing a cameo in one of his hero movies. Action-packed and good humor, too.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I LOVED this movie.<br /><br />I took a course in screenplay writing and we learned about the flow of a movie and how certain things are \\"set up\\" and \\"paid off\\" later in the film. This was by far one of the tightest films screenplay wise that has come out in recent years. EVERYTHING was set up and paid off very well.<br /><br />The soundtrack was simply amazing.<br /><br />Perfect little one liners at just the right moments.<br /><br />The action was amazing as were some of Batman's toys.<br /><br />...and of course Christian Bale is hot.<br /><br />By far the best of the Dark Knight series.<br /><br />I cannot wait to own this!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great action movie with finally a heroine as protagonist. Looking forward to the next one.  I read the books and thought this was a good movie rendition.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I was sure they were gonna murder this story concept with the censors, but I am very pleasantly surprised with the care taken to ensure the content of the story.  Very well done!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I've loved the alien movies since I was a kid, and this movie was a great beginning for the storyline. It put a lot of things together and I'm excited for the next one.
B008A1TIOK|5.0|It is a different interpretation of The Four Seasons. I love it. It sounds like progressive rock<br /> I recomend this record
B005UKKDAC|5.0|Loved it! The entire family enjoyed this, and Kevin made this movie in true form. Hopeing for a number two.
0345803485|1.0|I know that millions of women are in love with this series, but I just can't get into it.<br /><br />I'm by no means a prude, but I just find the writing to lack something... and I don't understand how these books have caught the minds of so many people... perhaps these women have led a sheltered life until this point and this is their first experience with this gray area of sexuality (pardon the pun, I had to do it...) and they are enthralled? That's the only thing I can think of but to those of us who have seen the darker shades of the gray area (had to do it again, sorry) of sexuality, there really isn't much of a point in reading these.
B0026P3G12|5.0|...and have all her CDs of her singing. She is a very dear heart, and so blessed with a gorgeous voice.
B0034G4P9E|3.0|It seems the disk only works in one of my blu ray players for some reason. Won't even load into the one in my living room... Very strange.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I am amazed at the realism and graphics of this app. Three different airplanes, and three views for each. The F-14 eve. Has a control for swinging the wings. The hardest part is power control a.d maintaining a steady speed- just like the real thing.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I caught a glimpse of this movie on a flight to Chicago, and I was dying to see the whole movie.  We rented it the weekend before Thanksgiving and my 4 1/2 yr old son loved it, as well.  He calls it the &#34;movie with the bow & arrows&#34;.<br /><br />The story of this movie allows me to explain to my son that everyone can be a Bear at times.<br /><br />Looking forward to purchasing this movie, as soon as we get the Blu Ray player installed.
0394716787|5.0|I had a huge Poe Exam for my AP Literature & Composition class that covered 8 poems and 8 short stories. I was looking for a collection of all his works where I could highlight material, and quickly find any of his works. I did not want to waste too much money on something I was only going to use once, so I recommend buying this book for anyone who needs it as a quick reference or a short interval of time. If you are looking for a gift or a small treasure to pass down from generation to generation I recommend buying a hard cover book. The cover of this book fades quickly if you travel with it placing it on different locations.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|I had high expectations for Henry Cavill and the film, but they were largely left unfulfilled.<br /><br />The film is okay and that's about all.<br /><br />Not much substance to it.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Smoothest singer out right now been a fan since day even tho yhat doesnt matter but the weeknd is a pure beastvwith the vocals and lyrics
B0053O89XI|4.0|I enjoyed the product, was pleased with the purchase, just wish I had been able to find it in only the blu-ray. Don't really need the DVD copies included.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another excellent read from an outstanding author. I recommend this book highly. I hope to see more of his talented books
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|This is just what I have been searching for. All jazz on this sta.tion. This is a must for all.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Very good movie.  I want watch Breaking Dawn - part 2. I hope that is good movie too. Ha ha .I  love it.
B005ILYW1E|4.0|Always enjoy Jason Statham movies this is no exception. You will not be disappointed. Lots of action as you<br />Would expect
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You can't help feeling like these characters are your friends. It's easy to get hooked on this awesome show and the blood thirsty zombies.  Wonder how many of these dead creatures Rick and the rest have killed the past 3 seasons?
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Easy to find and purchase an item, works almost as well as sitting at my computer. Get it if you haven't already.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is really a fun game with enough challenge to keep you playing but not frustrated. I play this game all the time when i have a few minutes to spare. I just wish i could get it for my iphone.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I hate to admit how many times I have watched this movie.  Very elegant both visually and audibly.  I love the use of language in this movie.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I chose this rating because I like the book alot . I think if u haven't read this book than get to reading it
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I absolutely love Halestorm and once again they do not disappoint. I love every song on the album!!!! Favorite song is &#34;Beautiful with you&#34;!!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Loved this game. I definately reccomend it. It was challenging at times but bot that hard. It took me a little while to finish it. It was great.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This is an amazing movie. It came on time and in perfect condition too. $10 is definitely worth it, as I saw it three times the first week I got it. In a way the movie forces you to get it's worth in. This is not a movie you'll see once, I promise you. I still don't understand a lot of it. Definitely going to watch it more in the future.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|It is ashame that the dumbing down of America has infiltrated to<br />Gollywood. Shame on the writers, producers and director. For using the<br />name and image of one of our greatest leaders in such a grotesque way.<br />This to the sane persons of this nation should be consider treson!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I could not put it down. I will be recommending this to my friends.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Loved all of the twists and turns!  I'd definitely recommend it to others. I can't wait to read more books by this author.
B0020VKZ4I|5.0|Outstanding!! Diana is always the best and she produces great recordings! Can't go wrong buying any of her records! The best!
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is awesome I couldn't live with out it I have been carry around my laptop just to have pinterest with me but now all I need is my kindle.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love Pinterest! this is so addicting I have it on my phone, my Kindle and my computer. the app works great, I love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game dj d d d Rfd f f d d s d s d f d z d r
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This is like 5th time watching this.. still is good.. though there was a better movie at that time, which is Dark City advisable to watch that too.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|There was a time, along while ago that I'd heard the name Florence + The Machine. Because there seemed to be a buzz about them, I thought it was all hype. Well that confusion cleared itself up when I happen to catch their SNL performance. Nothing says true talent like a LIVE performance. My recommendation regarding Ceremonials or Florence + The Machine would be listen and judge for yourself.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|IT DESERVES ALL THE STARS IN THE SKY.  AUDREY HEPBURN AT HER MOST SOPHISTICATED AND ALBERT FINNEY IS A GREAT MATCH.
B007REV4T8|2.0|I've seen all the Bond movies (except for the spoof \\"Casino Royale\\"), and I've read all the Fleming-authored Bond books.  And I have to say that \\"Skyfall\\" was a profoundly disappointing entry in the Bond canon.  Maybe that's because it's nothing like any of the other Bond movies:<br /><br />-\\"Skyfall\\" drags at times, greatly to the detriment of the story...classic Bond movies never have this problem.<br /><br />-\\"Skyfall\\" features far too much of Judith Dench...I know that the plot centered around sins from her past but that's what's wrong with it.  This is supposed to be a James Bond movie, not an \\"M\\" movie.<br /><br />-\\"Skyfall\\" is unpleasantly grim (like its immediate predecessor \\"Quantum of Solace\\" which was also dreadful).  The few fleeting attempts at humor are so isolated, they fall flat.<br /><br />-\\"Skyfall\\" also suffers from what Roger Ebert calls \\"the idiot plot\\" problem (i.e. the plot only makes sense if the people in the story are all idiots)<br /><br />&lt;spoilers><br /><br />What do I mean by that?  Well, if the head of the British Secret Service is being stalked by someone, taking her to a remote estate in Scotland where there is only Bond to protect her (along with a cliched servant character) is the worst thing possible to do.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is also arguably the first Bond movie where the villain triumphs.  He wanted to kill \\"M.\\"  Bond kills him before he can blow M and his own brains out.  M then succumbs to the wounds she suffered earlier in the story.  So evil did triumph in the end.<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />I don't want to be totally negative here.  Daniel Craig does a good Bond (I really liked his debut in \\"Casino Royale\\" (the non-spoof version)).  The movie has some spectacular scenery...especially the Macau casino Bond visits.  But that's about it
B001RHPJBU|4.0|Nice vinyl collection at a great price. Collins' voice takes me right back! What a bargain! Highly recommend if you remember too.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|I was very pleased with CD. I think Tommy T. does an excellent job and sounds more like Ace if not even better. They keep getting better with age in my opinion.
B009YU62H2|5.0|If you like SG earlier albums, you will dig this! You will not be disappointed! Makes me want to break out my flannels and black boots.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|First, it's a gorgeous package, and mine was shipped very well. No problems there.  I have now played each record and listened to them closely. Unfortunately, there are quite a few problems with the vinyl pressings themselves.  I consider myself fortunate (after reading some of the experiences of others) that I only had ONE of the 14 LPs that was unplayable.  The second side of \\"With the Beatles\\", (\\"You Really Got a Hold On Me\\", \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\") is completely unacceptable due to what looks like a big scuff which smears and distorts the sound and reduces the volume on each revolution.  There are also problems on other of the albums. For example, on \\"A Day In the Life\\", just before the vocal comes in there's an annoying distortion and crackle.  Several of the other records in the set also have pops and crackles as well.<br /><br />But, when the pressing is okay, they *do* sound pretty good. And the package, the book and the other little touches are pretty nice.  Hence the 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.<br /><br />For the one that is unplayable, instead of returning the whole thing, I found a seller to just buy \\"With the Beatles\\" from.  Hopefully, it isn't also bad.  I'm not sure what I would've done had there been multiple records in the set that were unplayable.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a HUGE quality control problem.  And, it appears to be squarely on the shoulders of the plant where these were pressed (Rainbo Records?).  I will be very interested in seeing how this falls out - the uproar will be BIG.  $319 ain't chump change.<br /><br />Lastly on the label of the Magical Mystery Tour LP, George Harrison is listed as the composer of \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\". Hmm, that's not what my '67 original pressing of MMT says.<br /><br />So, if you're buying this set to put on your mantlepiece and look at, go ahead.  But, if you're expecting high quality pressings that you're going to actually listen to, then buyer beware.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Mathew has embaressed himself witht his picture!  Can you say &#34;Give me the money&#34;?  We hope you start making better choices in your career, case we really like you most of the time.
B007K8ILTW|3.0|Stanley Kubrick never intended for you to see this, his first feature film.  I've read that he even tried to buy up every existing print so that none of us would ever see it.<br /><br />But FEAR AND DESIRE is now available on DVD...and it's definitely worth it for the Kubrick fan who wants to see it.  The restoration is beautiful but it's still very much a first film.  After studying Kubrick films and reading books about him all of my life, it was great to see the actual film after decades of stills and descriptions.<br /><br />Also included is the documentary, THE SEAFARERS (1953), a short documentary Kubrick shot to raise money for his next feature film, KILLER'S KISS.<br /><br />Now if they can only find the pie fight scene from DR. STRANGELOVE, restore the 20 mintues cut from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and add the hospital scene from the climax of THE SHINING, we'll have everything Kubrick ever shot!  (And, yes, fellow fans, I didn't mention THE FLYING PADRE because I'm being facetious...half-facetious).
B008QTVNUI|5.0|You'll LOVE homeland.  It's got the same taut storytelling, but a bit more believable.  The twists and turns are non-stop and will keep you guessing.  I highly recommend it.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I am a total sucker for the whole bad boy thing and this book was totally a great choice..... I loved it sooo much
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very good book. It keeps you engrossed so that you don't want to stop reading. I would recommend this to all.
034580404X|5.0|These books are all that I heard they would be. I bought them because I had heard great reviews on them and they were all correct.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|His book is the best yet. It has action and a bit of love. I can`t wait for the house of hades. Iwish it hand not ended on a clif hanger.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Best book Ive read in a long time!!! I would rate this book 5 stars !!! I wish there were more books to this series!!!! Loved th he ending...awesome book!!!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|The book was a treat; the technical aspects of the story were presented in an interesting way (I thought the code sequence were a funny touch.  I recognized a bit of a decrypter in the book, but fortunately I didn't have to break out my x86_64 assembler manual to follow the story!)<br /><br />I have always been greatly-impressed with Mark as a technical guy, but this is unexpected: the ability to weave a complex, realistic and fast-moving thriller out of the gate.  I hope Trojan Horse is as good.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I share the same concerns as many others; potential buyers should carefully read all of the 1-2-star reviews. I purchased this box brand new, and the first 2 LPs I opened and tested (Let It Be and Sgt Pepper) were defective; different audio tracks were missing or very quiet in 5.1 surround. On side 1 of Sgt Pepper, the vocals were inaudible. This is not a speaker/receiver issue; my 300+ other albums play 100% fine with no issues. I returned the box before testing the other LPs and did not order a replacement. Very disappointing. A big pre-holiday let-down. Hopefully a fresh pressing is being arranged...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Having fun with this throwing birds at things to get to the next level and it keeps me occupied when my eyes get tired
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I loved this version. It captures all the elements of Jane Austin without becoming boring. All the characters are very likeable.
B007712XAU|5.0|I watched the series and bought the dvds for my mother. She is now a huge fan, and has already re-watched the series a few times. Perfect gift for anyone that loves the nostalgia of period pieces and wonderful characters!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Fantastic movie!  Saw the musical in NYC and wanted to see original.  Glad I did, original music and score are fantastic.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I don't quite understand how to use it. So I don't use it, I need to have someone show me how.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|It's not just an action flick, but has some depth to the relationships and explores our preconceived notions.  Worth the time.
B008BM9L72|5.0|For those reviewers that have slated the writing style, I would like to remind you that you have completed missed the intention of the author to create a feel that is authentic to the world of Ana and Christian.  The trilogy allows one to immerse yourself in their world.  For those of us that choose to read fiction as way for escape and relaxation, fifty shades allows you to do this without fail.  I would encourage everyone willing to listen to go out and buy the trilogy now!  I have thoroughly enjoyed the books.  Thank you for a wonderful read.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|With the level of integration Google Drive and Dropbox gives, this is too little, too late.  Amazon has to make this easier, e.g., provide a FUSE client, instead of some web interface only system.
B009QW7MQS|3.0|My 9 year old son likes the remote control BMW.  Most of the scenes are like in a cartoon movie.
B0037VNX44|4.0|I watched this movie because i'm a big fan of Tom Hardy, and it's a great performance by him.  The telling of the story is a little odd to me, however it is an interesting story.
B000055Y0X|5.0|love this eccentric depiction of the cold war era. Peter Sellers is fantastic as several characters. and you get to see many actors who had not made a name for themselves yet in the business...very good movie, I'd recommend it.
B001KQEA5E|5.0|Greatest West Coast albuM of all tiMe highly recoMMend it to any hip hop head won't be disappointed at all
B008QTVNUI|1.0|Homeland's portrayal of mental illness is abysmal at best, serving only to worsen the stigma it already holds within our culture. Over 25% of Americans have at least one diagnosable mental illness, which is important to know. It's the LEADING cause of disability in the US and Canada. Until our culture can accept this we'll continue to see the media sensationalize mental illness, which is exactly what Homeland is doing. Why the audience seems to believe it does otherwise is a mystery to me. Mental illness is serious; it's not a farce.
B0098VXDDS|5.0|The acting is great and the storyline is sure straight -- &#34;kill them all&#34;.  The historical record is sparce, so most of the subplota are conjecture. Slaves good, Roman slaveholders bad.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love the dragons and lots choices and always something to keep it interesting i cant wait to discover new hybrids and breed those for new baby dragons!!
1451695195|5.0|I was interested in the topic of this book so I preordered it and eagerly awaited it's arrival.  As I started reading I discovered that the author lives in the same city as I do so that was even more exciting.  This book was beautifully written and kept my attention from beginning to end.  I received it on Saturday and finished it on Sunday.  It is also a book that took a good deal of courage to write and I am grateful to Dr. Alexander for sharing his experience.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone who has an open mind and a curiosity about the meaning of life and the miracle of our existence.
0785163174|4.0|As a big fan of Hope's story I was really looking forward to this event. I was never big into the Avengers, but I've been a life long X-Men fan. When I read it as single issues it seemed to drag at times. Having it as one straight graphic novel is nice. It seemed to read a lot better. My main issue was there seemed to be too many writers and artists involved. It made it feel like it was all over the place at times. I didn't have as big of an issue with the art as some of the reviews on here have, but I'm not super picky if the story is good enough. I wouldn't say it was the best X-Men event but it wasn't the worst. After reading AvX Consequences, I think those 5 issues may have been better than the whole AvX event. Maybe because they stuck with one writer.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie was as expected.  A lot of shoot'em up action but very little story.  Not bad for a rainy day.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Amazingness and the first one also enter than the original to certain love mythology but Norse even more so than this
B007TMON8M|4.0|It's a decent game. My brain just isn't the greatest at this kind of game so I've gotten through half the levels and I think that is about as far as I'm gonna get.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|to all those who perform or love to listen to music...this is an absolute must see<br />to all who have spent time in a foster home...this is an absolute must see.<br />to those who love happy endings and to those who love Robin Williams ... don't miss this one
B002KEZ96Y|2.0|It had way too much profanity for me. Basically a weird movie. I would not recommend to my friends or family.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Love this movie and love Wes Anderson. He's not afraid to take chances and is subtly funny in his writing and directing. Definitely not a movie for everyone but anyone who can appreciate unformulaic movies will love this one, pulled off by a GREAT cast!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I was so excited when this finally came out for Kindle! I played it loads of times on my boyfriend's Iphone. I have noticed that every now and then it has a tendency to lag for a second or two though which causes me to die half the time.
B001706I5I|5.0|The best and funniest Christmas movie by far. Wouldn't want to go another Christmas without it! So buy it now.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I didn't complete download upon reading this software needs access to the internet. I don't like having my system vunerable to hacking, viruses, etc.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|you should not get this game because it gives you 10 minuets to play it is so stupid DO NOT GET THIS APP
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really awesome book! I highly recommend it to almost anybody! I normally read fantasy and still devoured this one in under 24 hours.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! It is a great movie to watch with family and friends and it will keep you laughing and singing along all the way through!
B008GJV4F2|5.0|The magical story of love and chocolate.  This movie is absolutely amazing. It is full  of romance,laughter,and beauty. A true treasure and story you will rememberand love.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|We &#34;Twihards&#34; just have more to love!  The story just continues to get better and better.  I highly recommend it!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I totally love this game. Haven't played it in a while but it was always funny because the boyfriend would complain that I shook the whole bed when the pomegranate came up lol.
B00138H6KA|5.0|What a voice on this woman. Great album, can listen to it over and over. You will value it too.
B009P13RQY|4.0|If you're a fan of 70's Black Sabbath, you'll most likely be a fan of this album.  I forgot a couple of times that I was not, in fact, listening to Ozzy and company.  Overall I enjoyed this album.<br /><br />This album was a recommended by Amazon, so that function of the site seems to work well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes it much easier to navigate Pintrest than on the browser on my kindle.  I only have minor quibbles (it won't show how many pins are on a board until you're on it), but this is still excellent.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have several games on my kindle and this might be one of my favorites. Even though it is the same concept in every level they add enough twists to make it stay interesting.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Really awkward to set up and not at all straightforward to use.  I don't know why but it didn't work so I deleted it.  Perhaps it will work great for you.
B005E3ZMZ6|5.0|I've been listening to King Diamond/ Mercyful Fate for nearly 20 years now, and he just keeps getting better.  If you are familiar with any of the King's works, you will know what to expect.  Though after all this time I still don't know how the hell he hits those high notes.
B00271SFB6|4.0|I rewatched this movie after seeing it when it first came out, and I actually liked it a lot better the second time around.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's Angry Birds...does anybody even read the reviews on it? It is pretty much one of the best app games ever, so simple and yet so addicting.
B005CYLG5W|1.0|If you expect Blu ray audio and pic this is not the show for you. Horrible quality. DVD looks and sounds better.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I was quite pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this movie.  Bill Murray was terrific as usual.  The movie dealt with first love in a wonderful way.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Once again the front man of Maroon 5 delivers their best album to date! It rocks! Great songs. I am very impressed!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is sooooo addicting! I'm pretty much in love with it! I've noticed I can try to figure out a puzzle for like 10 minutes and not get it, so I set my kindle down and go do something else, I come back and get the puzzle right away.
B007G51UV0|5.0|Only thing I missed was Bluetooth, my wife's P8Z68 V Pro motherboard had BT, yet was missing from this, but I picked up WiFi, so it works out.<br /><br />Updated BIOS helped with ISRT/SSD function as it was quite fussy until the update was done.  I've only built a few computers so can't compare this board to many others, but the BIOS setup screens are pretty easy to navigate, the instruction book makes everything pretty clear.<br /><br />My only complaints (minor ones, I did give it 5 stars) is with the instructions for some of the BIOS setup information.  Perhaps it's my noob status as a computer builder, but I tried to look up info about xHCI Mode because I saw it in the BIOS setup page.  Books says &#34;enables optimized xHCI&#34;.  Real helpful.  Some other features it has more info about to give you some basic info about if that feature is needed or not.  If you're a noob builder, it's worth going through all the options and considering how to set each one, as the defaults aren't always what you want or need.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Very good album, but not as good as Hot Fuss. I have several songs in my head right now. I love Amazon's prices for Mp3s!
B00A7ZXH4O|5.0|Excellent CD!! You will love it!! She rocks it out as usual and every song makes you want to dance!!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Nothing much to say other than I really like this movie. Grew up on John Wayne and love most of his films.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Gives you a nice visual of the different wifi signals within range, both in a nice list and a nice graphic.  Helps in understanding why channel 1 and channel 2 are not actually much different as the graph shows the overlap between adjacent channels nicely.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|did you know about the website 4shared? you can get android apps for free. you need to make a free account to be able to download things. just type in Survivalcraft apk. that's how you get the app for free. you can also get any other apps for free that's on the kindle fire app store.
0307960471|5.0|The best of the Harry Hole novels, Oleg, the son of his former girlfriend Rakel, is arrested for murder of a drug dealer and Harry returns from Hong Kong to investigate. Sober and cleaned up, longing for Rakel the love of his life, Harry is still fighting against his love for Jim Beam. The story is told from two viewpoints: a third person narrator and by the dying junkie Gusto, whose entire story is told during the duration of chiming church bells. Old characters from previous novels (Redeemer, Leopard) are in this book and you need to start way back in this collection to really appreciate them all.<br /><br />Harry with his face scared from the last novel is determined to get to the bottom of this case which involves drug dealers and crooked cops. He picks up a few more war wounds in this one but it is not nearly as violent as previous Hole novels. Instead, Harry is more reflective and at times guilt ridden because he was not there to help bring up Oleg who looked to him as his father. And Harry either due to his drug and alcohol use is beginning to forget his time with Rakel and Oleg. The memories are starting to fade. One thing is for sure is that Harry is becoming more like the criminals he is pursuing. Indeed, he is committing crimes like the criminals as well which adds to the dark mood of this novel.<br /><br />Nesbo not only writes excellent detective novels, he writes extremely well plotted books with characters that will haunt you for a long time. Harry is the best and most compelling detective I have come across in a long time. Gifted at police work, a loner by nature also humorous at times with well timed sarcasm and the right amount of bad boy in him to go against authority and do things his own way. Tough but a romantic at heart. You catch that plane Hole.<br /><br />Love you Harry!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|All the fun and mystery of Christmas and belief. The artwork is stunning and, in 5.1 sound, very compelling auditorily.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|All the battery apps seem the same, but this one has a few features I like, and of course you can't beat free.<br /><br />It has a record of the charges and discharges of the battery, it allows you to see when it was last charged, how fast it charges and discharges (you can compared different chargers), but otherwise it's pretty typical.  You can calibrate it for different functions so it can more accurately determine how much web surfing, music playback, video playback or gaming you have left on the current charge level.
B00870ZH3U|4.0|This takes the original story to the next step and what a wonderful step it is.  At first I was disappointed that it wasn't with the original London cast but the Australian cast is just amazing. If you read the book that this was adapted from, put it from your mind, they may have used the premise but it it totally different from the book.  I can't say enough about it, it was beautifully produced, the singing is astounding and the cast . . . was amazing.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Could have been a good comedy or a good horror movie or a good spoof, but trying for all three in one movie just did not work.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Lots of funk here and had it not been Donald Fagen it might not have worked. But its funk rhythms are complemented by his wit in lyrics and it all works.
B005K17RU0|2.0|It stopped working a while ago, usually it won't let me even put in the zip code so you're stuck at that start screen.  Even if I get it in, it's unstable and won't run.  Not sure what changed, but I've done all I can to make it work on my Kindle Fire, but no go.  Uninstall/reinstall/reboots, you name it, it didn't work.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|So far so good, im waiting for the rest of the season to see if its a five star rating
B00338QENI|4.0|Surprising & distressing that this expirimentation has happened so recently.  A great injustice was done to this woman and her family. A very well researched and presented account.
B009K0P10K|5.0|A friend suggested that I watch this but I had to catch up on it since I had missed the whole first season.  I couldn't stop watching!  It had me hooked immediately.  Start watching and don't stop.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what is going to happen next.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Requires a bit more thinking at times.  Definitely worth the price.<br /><br />So why is it longer reviews are required ?
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It loads fine but I can't see my newsfeed. it only shows 5 postings and then does nothing. Also from my page I can't load my albums. It needs more depth and usability.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hey the title sums it up for me. 0.5.0 isnt working for me but 0.4.0 is still pretty darn awesome. i build all the features or atleast prepare for when they will work
1574216988|4.0|I am new to Zentangle--I began with [[ASIN:157421327X #3450 Zentangle Basics]].  I enjoyed it very much so purchased this book next.  I love working through each page in the book.  I purchased a plain journal and work on 1 or 2 pages at a time--I practice the skills presented in the book and then make some of my own Zentangles using the skills.<br /><br />It has a GREAT section on shading which I worked on for a few days with great results.  It includes many different types tangles and exercises for changing them up and creating your own.  The step by step approach is at just the right pace for me and has taught me to be more open and creative with my Zentangles.
B005VT42BS|4.0|I've got a bunch of network scanners, no one seems to do everything I want perfectly, at least not enough for me to pay for one.  Fing works pretty well, but sometimes lacks info that others have, and vice versa.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Found it interesting was eager to read her new style away from Harry Potter - was impressed and a good read
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I could never play the game because it wouldn't download.  It would say download complete, but it was never there.
B004TTZHBK|1.0|Here we are, going on a year since Kindle Fire users started reporting that the app doesn't properly rotate to let you see the illustrations, which is supposed to be one of its best features...I guess we can assume that it's never going to be updated. It's a shame that Amazon is neither refunding Kindle Fire customers for their purchases, nor listing the app as incompatible with the Fire. Wish I could give it five stars, as I have for the Google Play and iPad versions of this same app, but in this state, it's a one.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|it's great... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ./.. ,... ... ... ... ... ... .
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|It is an amazing movie, a great quality and a modern notion of the disney princess, more contemporary and a down to earth character.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|From the Graphics to the Music...was an excellent Adventure. We purchased a copy for most of the Grandkids and Families.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  It was OKAY but not great
0061438294|5.0|it's great... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ./.. ,... ... ... ... ... ... .
B004GJDQT8|2.0|For me, I get much faster, accurate, and accessible, searches, by logging directly onto Amazon's official website.  Others may find it more useful.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|Peter Gabriel was introduced to me by my father when I was younger and I'm so glad that he did!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We enjoyed it, the story kept us going and we loved the accents.  Great movie for all ages.  How do they do that hair?
B003EV6DBM|5.0|it's great... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ./.. ,... ... ... ... ... ... .
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Sure demons may seem like &#34;old news,&#34; but just because they haven't been a primary adversary doesn't mean they weren't always the bad guys.They were from the start and it's fitting that once we're done with sideline baddies, we get back to the people who have been the enemy since the show started. I also like that we're revisiting Sam's dream of quitting. It's something we've all known he's wanted to do since the beginning. This season I think issues and enemies of the past are being looked at with more seriousness behind the decisions that are made regarding each of them. With each season the show feels more and more mature, especially since season 6 (my favorite season by far). I look forward to seeing this season unravel. The more the show grows, the more I love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a really awesome game. Good for passing time and such. Sometimes it get's annoying, but all together it's really fun. I'm happy I got this early, because sooner or later, it'll cost money.
