B0018CMJSU|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind that The Godfather and The Godfather Part II are the two best gangster films ever made and certainly two of the best films ever made.  The first film has the best cast of any film I have ever seen, and Al Pacino's performance in Part II is one of the best in film history.  Though Part III isn't as brillant as the first two films, it is still a good movie and was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.  Part I and Part II by the way, won the Academy Award for Best Picture.  All three films collectively were nominated for 28 Academy Awards.
1439102813|5.0|My family and I witnessed my father's mental deterioration as he gradually progressed through the stages of dementia. It was a painful and confusing time for all of us. Lisa Genova captured that difficult time in her narrative of Alice and her family coming to grips with Alice's battle with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Genova, gives a voice to each family member, including Alice, as the disease progresses and Alice drifts in and away from moments of lucidity. The book is a remarkable accomplishment and one that provides meaning and insight into the insidious character of dementia-related diseases.
B003L77GRO|3.0|Why is this title NOT available in digital format? This is ridiculous. Guess what, Showtime. I waited patiently for you to finally release this at Amazon, but it never happened. I would have bought every episode! Too bad for you that there are places out there where one can watch it for free. Now I've seen the season. Great season, by the way. I miss Rita, but Julia Stiles was a good fit, it seemed. Still, how could that have worked. Oh, well. Looks like my money and I will go elsewhere. Thanks for Dexter 5, but not in digital format.

1250004349|5.0|Some of the facts behind the story:    La rafle du velodrome d'hiver  (Vel' d'hiver Police roundup) was the arrest and eventual deportation of Jews in Paris on the 16 and 17th of July 1942. The Nazis called this Operation Vent Printanier (Operation Spring Breeze).  13,152 were arrested, 5802 were women, 4,051 were children according to French Police records and some 7,500 were taken by buses to the Vel' d'Hiver. Others were immediately sent to internment camps.  With its painted glass roof and windows screwed shut for security, the velodrome's heat soon became unbearable...No lavatories, one water tap... those who tried to escape were shot whilst others took their lives...  Five days later, they were sent to internments camps and from Austerlitz train station to extermination.    In 1995 French President Jacques Chirac formerly apologized for the role of French Police and Civil servants in this raid.    My review of this particular book:    Tatiana de Rosnay has written a most poignant story that no one will soon forget! Too often events such as the one described have been hidden away in the hope no one will remember.   But it happened and we should not forget!  Her writing is eloquent, her story can only be termed as mesmerizing and this is a novel I highly recommend you read!  Most of all, this is a story of an undeniable atrocity against people whose only crime was their race and many were French citizens!    Sarah's Key is a book you will feel compelled to finish no matter the powerful emotions you will experience at the series of events leading to the eventual climax of the story.   Sarah and all the other victims of that fateful spring 59 years ago should never be forgotten!    Finally, Tatiana de Rosnay choice of ending is one of hope and survival and I very much doubt anyone will dispute its ultimate message! We need to believe there is a better future for us all...  May God be at our side always...  Forgive but NEVER FORGET!    I gave this book 5 stars!Note: This story has now also been turned into a movie. As an after thought, this post reflects my opinion only and was not solicitated!

B004LROMSO|1.0|I must agree with all the poor reviews of \\"Camelot\\", Starz's entry into the world of King Arthur legend. The story has been told many, many times - and told well. If you're going to enter the arena again, you must bring something exciting, new, and rich to the table. This certainly is not it. Overall, the production is sparse and cheap looking and the character development is very thin. Copious scenes of random nudity seem to substitute for plot. What plot there is, is plodding and predictable. After watching a few episodes with high hopes, I stopped caring altogether. Game of Thrones on HBO is far, far superior in every way.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|I have 2 main things to say about this film.  One is a comment on the screenplay/story, basically what the director and screenwriter chose to put on the screen.  The other is about the actual product, that is, the DVD itself.    First, when you have a great story to film, why go to the trouble to create another one?  Of course some things needed to be left out, the book is simply too big to fit into a standard-length film.  A judicious pruning was required.  Which makes it all the more incredible that the writer and director decided to add scenes they invented in their heads that are nowhere in the book, squandering valuable time that could have been used to tell more of the \\"real\\" story, you know the one that millions of us have read and loved.  About what was left out and what was, inexplicably, added, others have said much and I'm not going to repeat any of that here.  Absolutely baffling.  I can't figure out what the director and writer were thinking.    Meanwhile, I have a beef with what I guess you would call the cinematography, or at least the way the film was transferred to DVD.  Yes, the story is a \\"dark\\" one, and it's getting darker book by book, but why does the picture have to be so dark that a viewer can barely see what's going on.  Something is wrong here.  This isn't atmospheric; it's claustrophobic.  I would like to be able to SEE what I'm watching, please.    I would love to have rated this DVD 5 stars, and there is much to like, for example, the ending is certainly suitably dramatic, but these issues have forced my rating of the DVD down to the 3 star level.
B000NYT1M6|3.0|I bought this for my son on his third birthday.  He instantly loved it right out of the box (what kid wouldn't).  As it was raining, he played indoors with it all day.  It held up well to his play, but he's very gentle with it.  Great movement + realistic = kid win.      However, there are two flaws to this truck.  First, like everyone states, the mirrors are flimsy.  I was scared to move them into their open position, as they felt ready to snap off.      Second, this truck is not easy to push around in grass or in the sand box.  The engine casing is designed to flip forward to reveal the engine.  It is held shut on either side by tiny rubber straps that are looped over tiny tabs.  Unfortunately, other than the engine casing, there is no great place for little (or big) hands to push this guy around.  As a result, the tiny bands are overwhelmed and the casing flips open again and again.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I liked this film.  I disagree with just about all of the criticisms I've read.  It is NOT too slow.  It is NOT too depressing.  It is NOT boring.  What it is, is a reasonably faithful translation to screen of what Ms. Rowling wrote (unlike with the case of The Half-Blood Prince).  And what she wrote was a grimly realistic depiction of a harrowing journey to the \\"dark side\\" of a Nazi-like fascist nightmare society and what it would it be like to be outlaws on the run from such a state.  I was deeply moved when I read the book of just how isolating and demoralizing being in such a situation can be, and on top of that, we have Harry's descent into doubt and self-recriminations, especially focusing on his relationship with Dumbledore, which he gradually realizes is not what he thought it was, as he comes to see that Dumbledore himself wasn't who he thought he was.    The testing of the bonds of friendship is a very important part of this story and I thought the film did a very good job of exploring that theme.    So why only 4 stars?  Because once again, as with the Half-Blood Prince, the DVD I bought is way too dark.  This simply cannot be intentional. There are times when I can't see anything at all happening on the screen.  After making all allowances for the fact that much of the story does take place at nighttime, in the dark, you still want to have the screen lit well enough so that a viewer can see what's going on.  The artistry is wasted if it can't be seen.  This impacted my enjoyment of the DVD.  Therefore, only 4 stars.
0515142247|5.0|This book had me at the edge of my seat all the way.  Each time the character seemed to be in a deep hole with no way out, Child figures out a plausible way for the character to get out of trouble.  Of course, he's never all the way out of trouble, but as they say, he manages to live to fight another day.  The Jack Reacher character is and always will be Superman in plain clothes.  He manages to figure things out that seem to be impossible to figure out and he fights like no one else.  He may be an almost unbelievable character, but he sure is entertaining.

B002JVWRAE|5.0|Everyone has different tastes in television shows, but Vampire Diaries (though the name implies a youthful, and amature show) is a cut above the rest when it comes to entertainment value. Great acting, well written and thoughtful story, exceptional cimematography, high production value, and good special effects make this a must see for any vampire fan, or any fan of a good plot with a good looking cast with edge of your seat action. I am a big fan of True Blood, and while this doesn't have the same gore, language and other adult content that make True Blood edgy, Vampire Diaries manages to keep the viewers excited and wanting more after each and every episode. If a good book is called a page turner, this show is an episode flipper! Over 20 episodes at around 45 minutes provides tremendous value for its first season. I highly recommend.

I was skeptical before buying, but can tell you this is worth the money.  I like the fact that he can now leave the house and be more social by bringing his xbox over to his friend's house instead of sitting in the living room with a headset on.      I am buying another for a family friend that is in the Navy.  He came over to the house a couple days ago and said this would be perfect for him on the ship.
0553801473|3.0|Here is my assessment of the series so far. The first three books were brilliant--truly great fiction. The fourth was plain bad, boring, and cumbersome to read. ADWD, the fifth novel, is an overall enjoyable book, but unfortunately it doesn't come close to approaching the brilliance and quality of the first three. Still, it is an improvement on AFFC and gives hope that Martin can return to form with the remaining books.<br /><br />As in AFFC, the characters in ADWD spend a lot of time wandering, and their travelogues -- replete with verbose descriptions -- are sometimes tedious to read. There's also a smattering of new POVs and a horde of new secondary characters, mostly of middling interest. The novel in general has more in common with the languorous AFFC than the fast-and-furious ASOS. And while a few open questions are answered, Martin leaves most threads dangling--don't expect many resolutions or climatic changes. ADWD, like AFFC, is definitely a \\"middle\\" book, one whose purpose seems to lie in transporting characters from Point A to Point B.<br /><br />But it's better than Feast. More happens, for one thing. The writing has tightened somewhat, though it's nowhere near as effective as in AGOT. And the central characters--Jon, Dany, Tyrion--and central events--those in the North, at the Wall, and in the East--are more compelling than the central characters and events of Feast, at least to me. Whereas Feast was largely a chore to read, this one was largely enjoyable.<br /><br />Still, I can't help but feel Martin has lost his touch. The first three books had a tightness, realism, and punch to them that AFFC and ADWD both largely lack. Perhaps that's because these books cover events in a planned five-year-gap that Martin ended up scrapping, and in a sense, weren't meant to exist. The great story we got in the first novels has expanded out into a soap-opera-ish sprawl. Deaths and cliffhangers that once felt tense and climatic now just feel cheap. And Martin's gift for writing character, making even minor characters mentioned in passing seem compelling and interesting, seems to have largely deserted him, as both AFFC and ADWD are filled with forgettable secondary characters. However, I am still holding out hope that TWOW will get Martin back on track and back to form.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|No offense, but anyone who gives this album a 5 star rating and calls it a \\"masterpiece\\" has NO CLUE what they are talking about. Masterpieces are albums that are perfect in every sense of musical creation. This album is so dull and far away from a \\"masterpiece\\", I giggled at many of these 5 star reviews and shook my head. There is nothing significant in this album. If you give this album a 5 star rating you are basically saying this is (among) Incubus' best album(s). If that is the case, which songs on this album call for the entire album getting a 5 star rating? If there are any filler and/or forgettable tracks on an album, you can't say that the album is PERFECT. I just have a feeling... no, I know that people who are creating these 5 star reviews are so butt hurt that a band they like created a mediocre album and now they are creating ridiculous 5 star reviews to make themselves cope with the reality of this album.    I've listened to every Incubus album and I can't take ANY song on this album and put it in Incubus' top 20 songs of all time. One step further, if Incubus were to make a greatest hits album today, none of these songs would make it. The majority of the songs on this cd are bland and forgettable. When I say \\"bland\\" I'm not talking about \\"slow music\\". I listen to plenty of slow music; one constant remains the same no matter what type of music you are listening to, the music creation needs to have life and leave an imprint MUSICALLY as a whole. Do you want to listen to a brilliant slow Incubus song right now? Go on youtube and search for \\"A certain shade of green acoustic\\", the video is a live video of them performing this acoustic version. Do you hear that? Is it slow? Yes. Is it brilliant music composition wise? HECK YES. Does Brandon Boyd's singing compliment and bring everything together? Yes, Yes, and Yes. That's musical brilliance. NOTHING on \\"If Not Now, When?\\" comes close to that song musically and it's not like that song is a guideline to whatIncubus needs to match in order for a song to be considered \\"good\\". It's just that when you listen to that acoustic version you say \\"wow, that's awesome\\". That's what you say when you listen to a \\"masterpiece\\" album no matter what the genre or style.    Brandon Boyd is a great singer, but the music he is singing over does nothing significant in this album. I can only give this album a 2 star rating, any more and I'd be fooling myself... and it hurts because I love Incubus, but I'm more of a \\"realist\\".     Hopefully Incubus licks their wounds and creates something significant next time.
B000002C1W|1.0|The first time around with this album, hearing it and its couple of pop hits on the radio, I commented to friends that it sounded like an entire album of David Gilmour's \\"There's No Way Out of Here,\\" from Gilmour's first solo album, whereupon I dubbed this album as sounding like \\"The Dave Gilmour Band.\\"<br /><br />Upon finding and reading the liner notes and noticing that Gilmour was the only member of the classic Pink Floyd appearing on all of the tracks, with virtually no appearances by Rick Wright and Nick Mason, I was surprised that the album lived up to my referencing it as \\"The David Gilmour Band.\\"  I guess Gilmour can't sell albums under his own name and had no qualms about selling out the Pink Floyd name for buckage.  All one has to do is check out comments by Nick Mason regarding what it was like when The Floyd got back together for Live 8, but then again we're talking about a drummer's and bass player's relationship.<br /><br />If you want to get a taste of what Pink Floyd was all about check out Roger Waters and skip this thinly veiled David Gilmour Band in a Pink Floyd wrapper, aka \\"Pink Floyd for poseurs.\\"<br /><br />I wonder if Gilmour will continue selling out via the PF charade now that Rick Wright has passed on (may Rick RIP)?
B000002MTU|4.0|My review title sounds pretty critical but this is a 4-star album. I'm deducting a point for Clapton's singing, which is uneven, and often sounds forced. By trying to be a great blues singer, and only partially succeeding, Clapton has lost focus on the fantastic electric guitar technique that made him a star in the first place. Cream and the Dominos' glory days may be gone forever but is there some reason Eric Clapton does not or cannot create the sort of fireworks he did with his incredible solos in White Room, Sittin' on Top of the World, Those Were the Days, Badge, Crossroads, Tell the Truth, Layla, and many others? His guitar also lacks some of the resonance of those earlier recordings. Does he think the Stratocaster sounds more authentic than the Les Paul? I dunno, I don't even own an electric, but there is a distinct difference lately. The Strat worked for Stevie Ray Vaughn but somehow it's not working for Clapton, at least not for me.<br />One final comment...these songs can boogie but they're not cutting edge, in fact some sound kind of dated. Kenny Wayne Shepherd has recorded blues for a new era, harder hitting but still flowing from the tradition. Great musicians keep their ears open for new sounds, and Eric shouldn't imagine he is past that point.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|I love Yes, so I was excited when I caught wind of this new album. After two listenings, it's really growing on me. I think Benoit Davis sounds somewhere between Horn and Anderson. He doesn't hit as high as Jon, but I think he sounds a bit more polished than Trevor (no offense Mr. Horn). If you like Drama, then this is sort of like \\"Drama-light\\". It's not as technical as Drama, which I like, but it has a bit of feel from that time period.     So why the 3 (more like 3.5) stars? For one, that's just my initial impressions. For me, it's a very good album, but I think I like the Keys albums and The Ladder a bit better. This is my second listening, so in time that could change. I think it's worth buying and maybe this would be a good starter album for those new to Yes music.    Another reason is I wished \\"Go Through This\\" was added to this album. That track, along with \\"Fly From Here\\", was also recorded during Drama's time. Two great tracks that translated well live. Overall, If this is a new direction Yes is going, then I'm anxious and excited to hear what the next album has in store.
0553801473|4.0|A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series (on which HBO's Game of Thrones is based, with season one covering the first book).  It does not, however, follow the traditional pattern of picking up where the fourth book left off.  Rather, due to the fourth book ballooning out of control during writing, A Dance with Dragons picks up where the third book left off.  A Feast for Crows (book 4) was limited to the action in south Westeros and Braavos; A Dance for Dragons concentrates primarily on the action in the North, the Free Cities (not including Braavos), and Slaver's Bay.  Not until more than halfway through the book is a plot thread from the fourth book continued chronologically.  And make no mistake, the concentration is all on the North and Essos.  Only six chapters of the seventy-three total take place in the south of Westeros.  While this leads to greatly missed fan favorites being heavily featured (Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys POVs combine for almost half of the chapters in the book), other fan favorites are almost absent (Arya, Jamie, and Cersei POVs combine for only five chapters).  There is no shortage of action and politics as Jon tries to prepare for the coming of the Others, Stannis and Roose Bolton maneuver for control of the North, and possible allies and ruthless enemies begin to converge on Daenerys.<br /><br />The split between A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons causes some issues (neither feels like a solid, standalone novel), but it makes sense not just geographically but in terms of an inflection point in the story.  A Feast for Crows in many ways wrapped up most of the major plotlines that drove the first three novels, while A Dance with Dragons features storylines previously on a side stage becoming the main show.  Martin appears to be well on his way to righting the ship after stumbling, and if the sixth book is weak, it cannot be blamed on its predecessors.  I personally rank the book above only A Feast for Crows in the series, but very close to A Clash of King (which is perhaps praising with faint damnation).<br /><br />For all of its good points (basically everything I don't specifically mention in this review), the book is not without its weaknesses.  The plot continues to suffer from a greatly reduced pace, lacking the breathtaking rush to climax of the first three books.  Much of the suspense of the story has subsided as well, and the climax is minor compared to that of earlier books.  This is probably unavoidable for a \\"middle\\" book, forced to worry more about transition than anything else.  What is not unavoidable are Martin's portrayals of the \\"good guys\\" in positions of leadership; they frustrate, as Martin continues to mistake justice for cruelty, honor for stupidity, mercy for weakness, and leadership for an inability to listen.only A Feast for Crows in the series, but very close to A Clash of King (which is perhaps praising with faint damnation).<br /><br />For all of its good points (basically everything I don't specifically mention in this review), the book is not without its weaknesses.

VERY CREEPY!<br />This is a great example of how a movie does not have to be gory or graphically violent to be scary.<br />PG-13 rating as it may scare younger children.<br />A slightly different twist on a Ghost movie.<br />I'll probably end up buying this one on Blu-Ray at some point.<br />A few brief scenes were a bit too dark and showed some pixelation on the HD stream but otherwise very clean stream from Amazon.<br />The only thing that didn't really work for me were the scenes with the primary baddie (fire face guy) in the film. I won't elaborate as I don't want to spoil anything but I could see most of that cut from the film. Most of the wrestling stuff could have been cut as well as it didn't really fit the mood.

He accuses others of being criminals, when he, himself, can't even look himself in the mirror. This book is a poorly written ranting of a drug addict seeking exoneration for his crimes and excesses.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Right off, I feel like I need to tell anyone who is planning on seeing this film, that it has adult content and situations that most people are not used to seeing in the mainstream cinema.<br /><br />I mean, this film has displays of human interaction that most directors have NEVER filmed in mainstream cinema EVER. So filmgoers PLEASE be warned before you watch!!!<br /><br />Moving on, I'd say this movie is basically about want. There's one character, the character who is a couples counselor, who wants to have an (Oh...I think a LOT of you know what I want to say.) But the thing is, is that this particular character seems to have an 'abundant' relationship with her husband (if you know what I mean), so why she has NEVER had an (Oh...you know what I'm getting at) is BEYOND me?<br /><br />I mean, a better character development for her would've been if she had quite the opposite with her husband. Because to see the two of them go at it--like at the very beginning of the movie, it's kinda shocking (to say the least) that the two of them have NEVER hit pay dirt. I think that for this part of the movie, the screenplay sorta over thunk the wheel.<br /><br />Though nevertheless, this dilemma is the reason we are pretty much introduced to the 'Shortbus' a type of social club where individuals go to meet and experience other people for these particular 'encounters' of...(well, insert adult content here.)<br /><br />I guess this couples counselor feels like this is the ONE place that will help her get to what she's trying to find--even though, given her status as a sex therapist/counselor, you'd think she'd approach this place with a certain amount of suspicion. Though wouldn't she be the eager beaver!<br /><br />Though backing up a little, she finds out about this 'Shortbus' place because of the couple she is currently treating--the two Jamie's--though one of them is now going by the name James.<br /><br />Going back to the theme of want, Jamie just wants to sustain his relationship with James--hence their session with the counselor.<br /><br />The want of James...well, that's a little more complicated because he has these issues that's making him quite depressed--he even takes pills to try to combat this depression. Only he's thinking ahead a bit and not wanting his lover Jamie to be...well, alone, initiates the two of them going to the 'Shortbus' to meet a third person.<br /><br />On the surface, this premise seems quite intriguing--aren't all threesomes supposed to be this way? Only James has a sort of ulterior motive working, because deep down he knows just how depressed he really is and well, because of this depression, he knows how things are probably going to turn out...so, like I said, he doesn't want his lover Jamie to be alone.<br /><br />Now just moving to this part of the film, I can honestly say that I was 'IN'. Forget that James and Jamie and their newly found third lover Ceth (pronounced Seth) move things along rather quickly to the point where they're all pretty much engaged in certain 'activities'. By this point, I was 'IN'!!! REALLY, I was!!! But then...I don't (can't) really elaborate on what happens. Though I CAN say that the national anthem is sung by Jamie and all I could think at that point was 'I'M OUT'!!! Because to have to have Jamie sing the anthem (as it were) was sooo unnecessary. It's like the director was afraid to do the scene straight (seriously, no pun intended!) And so he had to insert these 'funny' moments. Though to me, they came off as 'funny odd'?<br /><br />It's like I wish I could've told the director to trust his audience to be able to take the scene as it was. Or as it could've been.<br /><br />Because all of the silliness of the singing of the national anthem, sorta reduced the scene and really threw it away. Like the scene could've really did something amazing. It could've shed some light and truth and honesty. And been really powerful. Only with the singing, the whole thing came off as a big'WHAT'?<br /><br />And the thing that kills me, is that the actors involved in the scene were TOTALLY on board with the whole thing.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|Having all hardwoods and and a large family, we use our Swivel at least twice a day, and gladly repurchase this product every 1-2 years.  First off, the Swivel is the best sweeper out there for hardwoods.  Most particles drift to the baseboard so having the 4 corner brushes is invaluable.  We've used $100 plus cordless sweepers with vacuum suction and they still don't hold a candle to the Swivel.  Also, other sweepers don't flatten out for under furniture (where most dirt collects) as perfectly as this product.    In order to save some money we purchased through Amazon via Capital Outlet.  Product arrived brand new, but battery died in 1/8 of the time of previous experiences.  We can usually do the entire downstair (1200 sq ft) twice before needing a charge, and this didn't last a quarter of the floor.  Subsequent full charges (not exceeding 24 hours) with full discharges did not improve battery life.  Like I said, we've used Swivels for years and are familiar with use.  We returned product and purchased through an expensive retail outlet chain.    Seems experiences here at Amazon are mixed, so for the price it might be worth the gamble as Amazon accepted our return without hassle.

1933633867|1.0|The book argues that debt should be forgiven now and then, as it was in ancient times. It argues that nations should be able to borrow, then refuse to pay. The obvious problem with this view is that lending does not occur freely when borrowers refuse to repay. In ancient times interest rates were usurious, to compensate for the added risk of the king or dictator declaring a debt moratorium. The modern economy is far more highly leveraged than that of ancient Rome; it's more dependent on debt. If governments follow the book's prescription and most lenders refuse to lend, while others charge sky high interest rates, our standard of living will be more like that in ancient times. Billions will starve. Fortunately, there's little risk of that, since this book will likely sell less than a thousand copies.
B005869U6G|3.0|I have always loved Incubus, but this album isn't something I can listen to as a Man. Previous albums were able to mix high energy riffs and deep baselines with beauty and grace. Where is the high energy riffs and baselines I have come to expect from Incubus? I could listen to this album to fall asleep on a plane, but it's not something I am going to bump in my car (I don't think this album would push my sub). I am disappointed. Brandon recently did a solo album, why do another?  I say this because his voice is the only thing recognizable; the rest of the band seems non-existent do to their new artsy approach. I understand the band is \\"maturing\\", but I can't wait until they hit their mid-life crisis as a band and decide to rock out and make my ears explode.<br /><br />****Update*****<br />I will be playing the song \\"If not now, When?\\" while walking down the isle during my wedding.  Because of this I will give an extra star.  The album does tend to grow on you, but I stand by my review above.

0756405890|5.0|Like all good epic-fantasy, Name of The Wind grows along with the telling. More originally voiced than many such novels, this tale is much like having an ongoing series of well sung stories. Tied together by harmony of interesting characters and realistic settings, the troubadour's ballad strums true. The overall arc is revealed one verse at a time. If the author plays the lute, I'll journey to a tavern to listen.
1579128149|4.0|I think the book is good; it's not deep but I believe its goal was not to go deep into the Chemistry of each element.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I perused some of the 1-star reviews because it's sometimes interesting to look into mental illness; got bored quickly because of the silliness and pettiness. But I will respond to all the self-proclaimed \\"complex\\" or \\"abstract\\" music types who try to argue that Radiohead \\"aint all that\\" and such. OK Computer is great on several levels, but chiefly (along with the atmosphere it creates) it's great because it has great song-writing. An easy way to spot great song-writing is to consider alternate versions of the songs. Beatles songs are obviously great as, at least, they can be covered in many different ways and still sound great. Their own alternate versions, like those of Norwegian Wood, I'm Looking through You, or especially the first take of Tomorrow Never Knows, sound very different from what ended up on the LP's but sound fantastic in their own right. Likewise, Radiohead's demo/alternate versions of Airbag, Subterranean Homesick Alien, and Climbing Up the Walls, for example, highlight how strong the source material is, irrespective of how they were eventually recorded. Compare that to \\"complex\\" or hyper technically-talented bands whose only appeal is their sound, but never write a song anyone else would want to touch.  As the negative reviewers seem to put a lot of stock in what people like (as if one would only like Radiohead because they haven't yet discovered something more obtuse or supposedly hip), I'll list some of my favorite bands: Radiohead (obviously, though I don't care for their mutation into the Thom York Project), Wire/Colin Newman, The Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, The Wedding Present/Cinerama, The Jazz Butcher (Conspiracy), The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The (early) Kinks, early Stones, Joy Division/New Order, The Smiths, XTC, Tones on Tail, Swell Maps, Sufjan Stevens, Devotchka, The Clash, Leonard Cohen, Big Black, Nirvana, The Fall, The Mekons, Mission of Burma, early Queen, Cocteau Twins/This Mortal Coil, Alex Chilton, Teenage Fanclub, The Gun Club, etc.  My favorite sound of all is the post-punk power-pop of the late '80's/early '90's -- Wedding Present, Pixies, MBV, Nirvana, et al. What Radiohead does, for me, is combine the best elements of these (though without so much the WP/MBV wall of sound stuff) with the song-writing I like in the older classic rock. For me, Radiohead is The Pixies meets The Beatles, or The Smiths meets (early) Queen, and OKC exemplifies this happy union far better than anything else they've done. I've no shortage of stuff I really like, but it's my favorite album of all time, and I didn't even like the band before I heard OKC. I also recommend the b-sides from The Bends, OKC, and Amnesiac. Great stuff, worthy of lp's (or ep's) in their own right (I guess ther was How am I Driving, but it didn't include Lull). Best Radiohead outside of OKC? For me, I Might Be Wrong and Knives Out from Amnesiac peaked their logical progression from OKC (with National Anthem and How to Disappear being pretty amazing as well). Also, the version of Follow Me Around from MPiE is fantastic. In the end though, OKC is not only one of the best albums of the '90's, it's one of the best albums ever. Simply jaw-dropping.
0802473156|5.0|This book is great, read it because someone gave it to me, thought it looked silly though. I was really impressed, it is super simple, but in a life changing, \\"why the heck didn't I think of that\\" way.  I just had my husband do the online test, and had him read the chapters on my \\"languages\\" and the two on his. I think that is why its somewhat redundant, somethings apply to multiple \\"languages\\". I love this book and I think that it applies to all relationships, and not just marital ones. Great insight on yourself and your significant other. Also, the online test is really accurate, I was very skeptical, but pleasantly surprised.

I love the 50s and 60s jazz period, but, simply put, this is one of the most important jazz albums ... but also one of the best.

I have this one in the car and can always go back to it anytime - and do. Few albums do not get tiring after awhile. This is one of those.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|[This review is for the Theatrical Release.]<br /><br />The Theater Experience:<br /><br />I went to the midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II at my local AMC theater with a theater-full of wild and rowdy young men and women, boys & girls.<br /><br />Theater Experience:  Briefly, I'm sure that this same situation was repeated throughout the country.  Potter fans dressed up in their favorite school colors from Hogwarts, carrying wands and making like Hermione, Harry and Ron.  The theater did a quick giveaway promotion, a short costume contest and lots of cheering and yelling before the show started.  The place was packed.  Some special fans got their 3D glasses Potter style (round rims).  Even with advance tickets I waited a couple of hours to get in which was annoying, but the infectious crowd lifted my spirits.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows picks up where the first movie leaves off.  The Part Two film does not stand on its own - you have to see Part One.  Also, even better, read the book of the same title first, so you can fill in the blanks.<br /><br />Unlike Part One, I saw no discernible blanks for Part Two (in a mental book comparison).  The film was all about Harry and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (aka \\"You Know Who\\").  Not a lot of character development in this last film, since you should know who they all are by now!<br /><br />Harry is much rougher and grittier in this version.  The laughing, smiling children from Year One are not there now.  If anything they're in a struggle for their lives with You Know Who, Death Eaters and Dementors flying about.  The action scenes with the giants, the spiders and chunks of castle blowing out into the sky was horrific.<br /><br />The dead bodies and blood, the horror of the battlefield, make for some pretty grim yet realistic battle scenes lifted from the Rowling novel.<br /><br />There are humorous scenes as well - watch for Ron and Hermione's kiss right after they accomplish one of their Horcrux missions.  I really wanted to see more scenes with Harry and Ginny but it was not meant to be.  Neville Longbottom's scenes were scene-stealers.  The actor really captured the essence of this character.<br /><br />Memorable scene:  You Know Who's confrontation with Harry;  the duplication of the scene with Bellatrix (\\"not my daughter you b*tch!) was amazing.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Great tribute to the last book.  They could have really screwed this one up!  It's not perfect, but I give it five big stars for its spirit, not dwelling too much on any one scene or situation,  great pacing and dialogue.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Read the Books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1592575994 The Complete Idiot's Guide to the World of Harry Potter]]<br />[[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]]<br />[[ASIN:043932162X Harry Potter Schoolbooks: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them / Quidditch Through the Ages]]scenes with Harry and Ginny but it was not meant to be.

034537410X|5.0|I'm the biggest skeptic ever. I'm an engineer and I read science papers and articles all the time... so I'm very practical and I have a good sense of what's b.s. and what is reasonable and/or real.    I won't say that every claim in this book is accurate, but I have found the theme to be valid and some of the methods useful. I picked the book up because before this book I never remembered a single dream - ever. Now I not only remember them on a regular basis, but I have also had a few lucid dreams.    If you're a skeptic you may have a hard time getting through the book with all of its claims and proposed methods... but keep in mind that everybody is different and many people have found some value in the book.

0316098329|3.0|I was anxious to read \\"Room\\" having heard so many wonderful reviews. Everyone I talk to seems to have loved this book.<br /><br />I struggled to read from the beginning. Maybe it was the broken language of a five year old, maybe it was the repetitive nature. Whatever it was? It was slow. (I typically read a book in 2 days, but this took me an entire week.)<br /><br />I didn't feel that there was any real climax to this book, sure it picked up when Jack made his great escape. But it never really grabbed me the way many books do.<br /><br />I couldn't stand Ma's family. I tried and tried to put myself in their place, which is normally pretty easy with a book. But these characters were just so unlikable that I couldn't manage it. I liked Ma in room; and I can't begin to imagine her trauma, but I just had a difficult time sympathizing with her once they'd escaped.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't love the book. It was just sort of ok, and I definitely would not recommend it to my friends and family.
0553378384|3.0|... This book could use a little love.      While I found the author's insights on how the nodes can manifest useful - I've studied astrology at an amateur level for many years - I was dismayed by the tone of judgement throughout the text.  In addition to revealing life paths and inherent talents, nodes reveal core fundamental and often painful issues which manifest psychologically and materially.  While this book does suggest strategies for coping with or shifting a karmic challenge, e.g. affirmations, there was a lot of so-and-so 'needs to re-examine,' 'if [insert node sign here] would just...,' and 'the irony is...'.  While thick-skinned readers may find the writing style 'tell it like it is', I found the critical statements somewhat lacking in compassion.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|I'm not a huge green lantern fan, but I have watch enough of the cartoon to know this could have been better. I am a huge Ryan Renolds fan and was expecting to see more of his humorous side, granted that's not how the green lantern is. As for the movie it's not bad but it's not great either. As fun as it is to see these comic books come to life, you've seen one you've seen them all when they decide to make as a movie, nothing new that wow me. But I did liked it.

B003Z2LAAO|2.0|I am writing to inform everyone thinking of purchasing this DVD to be aware that there are some 3D effects that do not work properly. Most of the picture is set back too deeply that it strains the eyes to watch. Some scenes, primarily in the beginning, have bubbles that move about the screen, but as they get closer they separate into a split image that hurts the eyes allot to watch. We cannot even watch the intro because of this. The movie is great except for the depth level being too much. If you have a television that will allow you to adjust the depth level you might be alright, but the DVD options do not offer this ability to adjust. Good movie, bad 3D. Very unexpected from IMAX.
B004KVGIOC|4.0|After the critical success but commercial failure of his surrealist autobiographical trio ([[ASIN:B000M4RG06 Takeshis]], [[ASIN:B0015M652O Kantoku Banzai]], [[ASIN:B004SUIXWU Achilles and Tortoise]]), director Kitano Takeshi said he wanted to make a flick that was just popular entertainment.  Going back to his roots in the yakuza genre, the result of this commercial imperative is \\"Outrage.\\"<br /><br />Like when Kurosawa Akira made his \\"popular entertainment\\" flick [[ASIN:B00005B1ZL The Hidden Fortress]], Kitano can't really keep the art out of his filmmaking.  He took an unusual approach when writing \\"Outrage.\\"  After creating his list of characters, he decided how they all died then worked backwards creating a story that would accommodate their deaths.  The result is a violent and merciless film, one where one small action tips the dominoes of death, which march on relentlessly until all fall down.<br /><br />The story is set in Tokyo, where Boss Ikemoto (Kunimura Jun, [[ASIN:B004XXGFCM My Darling is a Foreigner]]) is recently released from prison, and gathers at a meeting to pay tribute to the yakuza lord of Eastern Japan.  It is known that in prison Ikemura swore an oath of brotherhood with gangster Murase (Ishibashi, Renji, [[ASIN:B002PHVHKS 20th Century Boys]]), an independent gangster who controls some turf and a drug operation.  The yakuza lord worries about Ikemura's new loyalties; is he plotting with Murase for an over throw?  Ikemura decides to allay these suspicious by picking a deliberate small-scale fight with Murase, opening an office on his territory and allowing one of his gangsters to fall for a Murase-scam so that he can demand reparations.  The plan escalates, however, as there are those in both Ikemoto's and Murase's organizations who would take advantage of the strife to advance their own position by killing rivals.<br /><br />One of the interesting things about \\"Outrage\\" is that Kitano gives us no great plot to hang on to.  Each player in the deadly game is pursuing their own agendas; be it to create revenue, level-up in the yakuza hierarchy, or simply take out some petty revenge.  There is no overriding plot, no clever plan.  The gangsters are opportunists, nothing more, each trying to figure out how to advance with their fingers and lives intact.  When a line is cut, that story ends completely.<br /><br /> \\"Outrage\\" seemed more authentic to the real, everyday operations of yakuza than most films in the genre.  There are no super-killers or honorable outlaws.  When I was watching the film, I found I didn't root for any particular character.  No matter who came out on top in the end, nothing changed.  It would still be business as usual exploiting innocent people and taking without earning as much as you can.<br /><br />In fact, this made me wonder at the title.  There isn't much \\"outrage\\" in the film itself, so maybe Kitano's \\"outrage\\" is at the system that allows these bottom-feeders to exist.  Or maybe it is Kitano's \\"outrage\\" that he has to fall back on crowd-pleasing flicks when few people appreciated his Art.  Or maybe he just thought \\"outrage\\" sounded cool.<br /><br />The only issue I had with \\"Outrage\\" as a film was the pacing.  The film got terribly slow in the middle, and a side-plot involving an illegal casino run out of an African embassy dragged on too long.  I generally like Kintano's pacing, with films like [[ASIN:1567302238 Fireworks]] and [[ASIN:B0002W4TOO Sonatine]] balancing out the slow and bang-fast.  Kitano's trademark oddball humor was also entirely missing from \\"Outrage,\\" and while I didn't want a lot of it a scene here and there would have been a welcome relief from the grim doings.heir own agendas; be it to create revenue, level-up in the yakuza hierarchy, or simply take out some petty revenge.

B004Y1USJE|5.0|Yes is a band known for transporting listeners into uncharted musical spheres.  Close the Edge ventured into cosmic states of consciousness, Gates of Delirium into the madness of war, and Tales from Topographic Oceans delved into mankind's collective unconscious.  Yes' latest foray, Fly from Here is a comparatively down to earth affair (it merely entails a voyage into the nostalgic realm of vintage air travel circa the 1940s).<br /><br />The subject of time travel is entirely appropriate given the origins of Yes' latest epic, which first surfaced as an unreleased demo from the sessions of the Drama album recorded some thirty years ago.  That album was the first and only album to feature The Buggles, the pop duo of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, who replaced the irreplaceable Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman.  Drama, however, turned out to be a solid, cohesive, and musically rewarding effort, but the newly configured Yes disbanded shortly thereafter.<br /><br />Trevor Horn became a successful producer.  Geoff Downes went on to form Asia.  And Yes has continued its musical rollercoaster journey while shuffling its membership like musical chairs.  Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman have returned to and left Yes so many times that I'm convinced that the song Roundabout refers to the revolving door members pass through on their way in and out of the band.<br /><br />Recent health problems have sidelined Jon and Rick from the band.  In a seeming act of desperation, Yes enlisted the vocal services of a young Canadian singer named Benoit David after discovering him on YouTube.  Shortly thereafter, Yes announced they were returning to the studio to record their first album in a decade.  Before long, the band leaked word that the Buggles were back on board Yes too; Trevor Horn would produce the album and Geoff Downes would take over keyboards from Oliver Wakeman, Rick's son, who had donned his father's old cape, so to speak.<br />By now, it seemed that the Yes saga had more plot twists and personnel changes than a daytime soap opera.  All the indicators suggested that Fly from Here was destined to be a musical letdown.  Against all odds, Fly from Here is the closest Yes has come to a musical masterpiece in more than thirty years.<br /><br />The choice of Beniot David has proven to be inspiration rather than desperation.  Following Jon Anderson is no easy feat, but Benoit has a strikingly beautiful voice, particularly in the lower and middle registers.  Like Anderson, Benoit also has the ability to soar vocally, but on the new album he wisely avoids trying to duplicate Anderson.  Instead, Benoit puts his own stamp on the new material.  In a band of world-class musicians, Benoit manages to sound both astonishingly accomplished and remarkably relaxed for a newcomer.  His vocals are effortlessly invigorating and a great fit for the band and the new music.<br /><br />Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes deserve enormous credit for reinvigorating Yes.  They are responsible for writing much of the new material, including the overture to the 24 minute title track, Yes' longest epic ever.  Yes is a band that knows how to make a musical entrance, and opening of Fly from Here is Yes at its breathtaking best.  The piece begins with a simple but haunting refrain from Geoff Downes' keyboards.  New musical lines are added in fugue like fashion.  By the time Chris Squire's thunderous bass enters you'll know it's time to fasten your safety belt.  When Steve Howe's guitar enters the mix you'll know you're heading for a destination that isn't on any map.<br />The title track consists of six song-suites which segue into one another.  Like classical music, Yes introduce a musical motif and then develop that theme in interesting and complex ways.  Yes has used this technique before, but not since Close to the Edge and Tales from Topographic Oceans has Yes used it so effectively.<br /><br />What matters in music, of course, is emotion, the ability to stir listeners, imbue them with a sense of wonder, and tap deep feelings.  There are several passages in Fly from Here that are as intense as anything Yes has ever done.  That is to say, there are some soul-stirring moments in this work.  Sad Night at the Airfield, in my view, is simply magnificent.  Here, the tasteful elegance of Steve Howe's acoustic guitar is perfectly matched by Beniot David's exquisite vocals.  The song begins wonderfully, but things really take off near the end with a heavenly chorus and Steve Howe's sublime steel pedal guitar work.  Suffice it to say, Sad Night at the Airfield is one of Yes' finest moments ever.<br /><br />Mad Man at the Screens contains the kind of music Yes fans live for.  When Yes are clicking on all cylinders their music has a focus, power, and intensity that is hard to match.  This is certainly the case with the mesmerizing coda to this track, where keyboardist Geoff Downes provides the musical sparks that ignite the band, essentially taking some terrific music up to a whole new level.<br /><br />What I love about this album is its freshness and vitality.  The music is consistently good, but on several occasions it soars clear out of sight.  There is not a single unnecessary or throwaway song on the album.  The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be showcases Chris Squire's exceptional vocal talents.  His innate musicality and sense of counterpoint harmony contribute to many thrilling moments throughout the album.<br />Steve Howe is a guitarist in a class by himself.  His solo acoustic piece, Solitaire, is everything Yes fans and guitar aficionados hove come to expect from him.  It is a gentle, warm, and tasteful piece that brings out the natural beauty and magic of the guitar.<br /><br />I'd be amiss if I overlooked Alan White's contribution.  White is to percussion what George Harrison was to the guitar.  In other words, White is not the flashiest guy around, but he always plays great and he always provides just exactly what the music needs.  The tandem of Squire and White provide Yes with a peerless rhythm section gives the music on Fly from Here a sense of forward momentum.<br /><br />Fly from Here concludes with Into the Storm, a song that combines Yes' cosmic approach with some self-deprecating humor.  The song exhibits all the ingredients that make Fly from Here such a winning album: wonderful melodies, a pervasive sense that the band members are having fun, and musical passages that consistently take off in unexpected but exciting directions.<br /><br />Fly from Here is the freshest, most exciting, and confident music Yes has made in decades. Newcomer Benoit David earns his Yes wings by doing such an unexpectedly fantastic job with the lead vocals.  Ditto Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, who have returned to the Yes fold after a 30 year hiatus.  Fly from Here, like the best of Yes' music, is a grand musical adventure includes many spectacular soundscapes and thrilling musical vistas.  Bravo, gentlemen.ere are several passages in Fly from Here that are as intense as anything Yes has ever done.  That is to say, there are some soul-stirring moments in this work.  Sad Night at the Airfield, in my view, is simply magnificent.  Here, the tasteful elegance of Steve Howe's acoustic guitar is perfectly matched by Beniot David's exquisite vocals.   The song begins wonderfully, but things really take off near the end with a heavenly chorus and Steve Howe's sublime steel pedal guitar work.  Suffice it to say, Sad Night at the Airfield is one of Yes' finest moments ever.    Mad Man at the Screens contains the kind of music Yes fans live for.  When Yes are clicking on all cylinders their music has a focus, power, and intensity that is hard to match.  This is certainly the case with the mesmerizing coda to this track, where keyboardist Geoff Downes provides the musical sparks that ignite the band, essentially taking some terrific music up to a whole new level.    What I love about this album is its freshness and vitality.  The music is consistently good, but on several occasions it soars clear out of sight.  There is not a single unnecessary or throwaway song on the album.  The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be showcases Chris Squire's exceptional vocal talents.  His innate musicality and sense of counterpoint harmony contribute to many thrilling moments throughout the album.  Steve Howe is a guitarist in a class by himself.  His solo acoustic piece, Solitaire, is everything Yes fans and guitar aficionados hove come to expect from him.  It is a gentle, warm, and tasteful piece that brings out the natural beauty and magic of the guitar.    I'd be amiss if I overlooked Alan White's contribution.  White is to percussion what George Harrison was to the guitar.  In other words, White is not the flashiest guy around, but he always plays great and he always provides just exactly what the music needs.  The tandem of Squire and White provide Yes with a peerless rhythm section gives the music on Fly from Here a sense of forward momentum.

0765318741|2.0|I never heard of Richard Matheson's work before seeing the Will Smith movie version of I Am Legend.  I'm not proud of that knowing that he pretty well thought of but after reading, or at least trying to read this I'm not exactly sure why.  The main story here while almost nothing like the movie also wasn't that good.  The story could have been fleshed out and the \\"science\\" didn't make much sense.  The ending was good but overall not very good in my opinion.  Sadly the rest of the book contained short stories that I struggled to get through then finally relented and gave up.  Clich&eacute; followed clich&eacute; which is odd for stories printed so long ago.  Overall this is something that is better about than read.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Recently purchased my Kindle and was thrilled to be able to download this book as soon as it came out.  I (like a lot of people, I'm sure) followed Jaycee's story in the media and was riveted by the events that transpired and I wanted to know more about how she was was recovering from her ordeal.  As expected, the descriptions of events after Jaycee's abduction were disturbing.  The book is Jaycee's story and she is an inspiration in survival.  I was touched by her innocence and pure heart.  I was left wanting to know more about the psychology of the victimizers and the victim--I guess a more in depth explanation of motivations, etc.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I honestly have watched the news and followed her story as I live within 30 miles of where she lived after being abducted. Knowing that everything you hear on the news is not always the entire story I decided to buy her book to hear from her, her side of the story.<br />I am not sure what I expected from the book, but regardless of that I was not disapointed! It at times wandered along, as she was lost in memories, but this goes to show that the book truely was hers to write and hers alone.<br />The book does go into some detail of what she experienced at the hand of Phillip, but those moments are enough to let you know just how bad it was without turning you off from finishing the book.<br />This was a very fast read and bless her heart I do believe she is going to be an amazing mom to her daughters, and a wonderful person to any friends she decides to let close to her...
0553801473|1.0|Little and less can I write that hasn't already been written. What I can do, is produce some numbers on the endless repetition of words that are wind in ADWD: breast(76), female sexual organs(27)**, teat(27), male sexual organs(41)**, urinating(29)**, turtle(26), whilst(131), amongst(148), defecate(35)**, leal(19), serjeant(57) (What ho! where did they come from all of a sudden?), much and more(38) - all put together and assuming that in a Times New Roman 12pt (or Courier New) the average page in a book has around 250 words - you end up having 2.5 pages with the a.m. words alone.<br /><br />And I have left out fat prey: \\"where do whores go?\\"; \\"words are wind\\"; \\"little and less\\"; \\"you know nothing, Jon Snow\\"; \\"I am but a young girl that knows nothing ...\\"; add another 260 wine(s) to that ...<br /><br />Quentyn Martell: Enter stage left. Propose. Access denied. Boom. Toast. 255 occurences of the name in the book. Let's assume, the name is mentioned three times/per page. Another 85 pages that I could do without. What's the purpose of Quentyn's storyline?<br /><br />The weird negations: \\"were not wrong\\" - what's wrong with stating one's right?<br /><br />I understand, ADWD has been beta-read by westeros.org. I also understand, that Mr. Martin has two editors assigned to his work. Then -over at sffworld- I read this quote, taken from Not-A-Blog (Jul. 18th, 2011 03:54 pm (UTC))<br /><br />\\"My editor has tried to take out \\"must needs\\" several times. I always put it back in. I like the phrase, and the archaic flavoring it gives.\\"<br /><br />Wait! I forgot that one in my tally!<br /><br />This was once an excellent series. The first 3 books blew my mind and won me over to fantasy as a genre. However, if the only enjoyment I can get out of a book is: counting repetitive words and phrases, new and completely uninteresting POVs and characters, the time has come to stop wasting money. For me, The Song is over.<br /><br />---<br />**Words originally used by the author substitutedto meet amazon.com PC. Interesting: you can't quote the American Tolkien on amazon.

0307341577|4.0|I like wicked scared my manicurist after reading this one, my nails are like wicked short, bitten to the beds I tell ya!  I told her it was all this here books fault-Dark Places.  This book is wicked intense, with great grisly details, it brings you back to the eighties when Sally Jesse Raphael and Donahue ruled the 2 of the 3 channels we got. They would scare the viewers with torrid tales of secret satanic suburbanites.  This story delves deeper into the \\"satanic teens\\"  in the heart of America-which is west of Cambridge, east of L.A. somewhere...Kansas? Hey that's where Dorothy is from right?  WICKED!  If you are from Greater Boston it will make you think twice about the Gerald A. \\"Tooky\\" Amirault and the at the Fells Acres Day Care and sensationalism.  I think it was a good summer read.  I felt it could of been more polished in the editing, but again wicked chillin :) I guess my fake accent could be more polished too.  Forgive me Boston!
1439153663|4.0|First off, I did NOT give rave reviews to The Help (Stockett).  I enjoyed this book much more (although it is quite sad).  Although I am no history professor, it seemed somewhat more plausible to me.  Anyway, I found it to be a very quick read and I sympathized with Belle and Lavinia, even though the latter is very naive (which she states later in the book).  As for those complaining about the lack of an Irish accent, that is a trite complaint.  How many readers could actually understand and appreciate that if it had been included? (Disclosure: I am at least 1/2 Irish.)  I think Grissom did a fine job in describing her characters and making the reader empathize with them.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I had to give this a 3 because i am on the fence about this. I needed a sharpener that could be used out in the field.

It is just...there. Not complete crap but its not golden nugget.

B0041X90ZS|5.0|From the opening notes as the house lights dim to the bombastic last cymbal crash, this is without a doubt the best concert DVD in my collection. Transatlantic not only epitomize modern day prog-rock, but this production shows how effortlessly they bring the majesty of their music to the stage with undeniably great success!     And the added bonus of \\"Return Of The Giant Hogweed\\" with Steve Hackett in the Special Features section is nothing short of incredible! If you don't have this yet, get it without delay!
B003L77GVK|5.0|I just finished watching the last 2 episodes of Stargate Universe and am totally heartbroken this wonderful series had to end abruptly. As usual lowbrow people lacking foresight have ruined things. ...A Fantastic and intelligent Sci-Fi with a slowly evolving story bites the dust due to lower numbers than required by the studio. They didn't even give it 2 full years of it's proposed 5 year story-line. ..Apparently many SG fans preferred more cheesy comedy, daily fights with aliens, shoot em up's and explosions than an actual darker, gritty meaningful drama with added psychological and philosophical elements. Something new, for a change, although I admit seemingly borrowing (some) similar ideas from Battlestar and Lost (like that's a bad thing?!). This show \\"To ME\\" had everything I wanted to see, Visually inspiring, Great acting, High production values devoid of artificial looking CGI everywhere (The New \\"V\\" anyone\\"). But when it was used, was with taste, and to great effect. Just like the entire series. But, well apparently not everyones cup of tea it seems. A real shame. Nothing left now but to try and remember what was a great show before so prematurely cancelled. I Highly recommend this show, but be ready to be disappointed when the ride is over.

B004G8ZZHU|5.0|It was a pretty fun movie. I thought the casting was excellent. Who would've thought Rampage Jackson would have a sense of humor? To become a pacifist....hilarious. Bradley Cooper was great as Face and Liam Neeson was the obvious choice for Hannibal. I cant remember the guys name who played Murdock, but well done. It's not going to wow you on a deep emotional or artistic level, but as far as just plain good old fashioned fun action flicks with lots of humor, gunfights, and explosions, it is in the upper echelon of recent efforts (where i would also include the Expendables and the Losers).
0142000671|5.0|I love the way Steinbeck describes the sights (p 11), \\"The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountaintops and dusk came into the valley, and a half darkness came in among the willows and the sycamores\\" and sounds (p 17), \\"Up the hill from the river a coyote yammered, and a dog answered from the other side of the stream\\" in this perfect story, originally titled Something That Happened, that takes place over a three day period on a ranch in the fields of the Salinas valley near the Gabilan mountains. After listening to the (excellent performance by Gary Sinise) of the audiobook, I read the written version, which didn't take long. The novella is only about 100 pages in length, conveniently separated into five untitled sections (p xvi) \\"so scened and set that it can be played as it stands\\" based on an actual incident in the author's experience. Note on this (Penguin Classics) edition - the introduction, though interesting, includes plot spoilers and thus should be saved for last.<br /><br />Of Mice and Men, set in the mid to late 1930s, is about the relationship between two farm laborers companions, Lennie Small, a hardworking, mentally challenged man, and George Milton, his caregiver of sorts. For a book named after a (Robert Burns) poem entitled To A Mouse, the fact that it begins with the main characters discussing one seems apropos. After arriving near their intended destination, a grain farm, the two spend the evening discussing the past, and contemplating the future; they hope to one day become land owners. Once they arrive at the job site late the next morning, George tries to convince the boss to employ them, after swearing the memory-deficient Lennie to silence. Over the course of the day they meet and learn something about all of the other farm workers and inhabitants. Most of the story takes place on this second (full) day including some foreshadowing of what will come later. The climax of the story takes place on the third day. I wouldn't dare say more as the best way to experience this story is completely unaware of any significant part of the plot. Best of the book: the character development, sights, sounds and climax. Of Mice and Men is a powerful story with intriguing ethical issues. Also good: The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, and Tobacco Road by Erskine Caldwell.t way to experience this story is completely unaware of any significant part of the plot.

B004HYDL1K|2.0|I both liked it and disliked this movie at the same time. The movie itself was pretty fun and there were several funny moments. I did kind of think Danny Trejo slept his way through half the movie (i expected his character to be a bit more angry and a bit less....old and haggard i guess). That is minor, however, in light of my main complaint.<br />The movie is really about illegal immigration, and is condescending towards the view that people shouldn't just be wandering around here with no legality. It basically says it's cool to just come here illegally and do whatever you want. My point of contention is that while the immigration laws need to be reformed, illegal immigration is actually a problem here in America. Undocumented people have an easier time committing crimes since they have an easier time disappearing afterwards. There is no accountability. That is really just one in a long list of reasons why illegal immigration is a problem however.<br />The movie takes the opposite view, and pretty much labels anybody who is opposed to illegal immigration as uneducated, a racist, redneck, or a criminal of some sort. It is a clever movie, but disingenuous overall...
0553801473|2.0|Bought, read, and promptly returned.  I know, it was bad.  But, in my defense, I couldn't help it!  The first three books were just so good.  Sure, Feast of Crows was disappointing, but (again) the first three books were just so good!  So, I had to know what happened.  I mean, GRRM might have turned it all around in this book.  Plus, it's well past the mid-point of the series, and we should finally be getting some answers (or so I thought).<br /><br />Well, we didn't.  In fact, other than some WTF moments, the book plods.  So, I've decided to give up this series altogether.  Don't get me wrong, the actual writing isn't bad (if overly repetitive and food-based) but the plot... GRRM's attempts to keep it compelling smack of desperation rather than inspiration.  And, that's a huge problem, because authors who try to consistently write \\"twists\\" into their books... well, it only works if they're truly inspired and the twists flow from the characters and the story itself.  The problem with Dragons is that GRRM seems to be trying to create \\"twist\\" plot points by throwing together new plots or characters, at the expense of the old and beloved ones.<br /><br />In fact, it almost feels as if GRRM got sick of writing the story/characters he wrote during the first three books, and decided to change it up and make it a little unpredictable.  Or, found something about the original situation didn't work, and couldn't quite figure out a way to paint himself out of that corner.  Unfortunately, in trying to solve his problem (to put it in tv parlance) he jumped the shark.<br /><br />Moreover, the way this book developed, and the lack of any kind of closure (or even move toward closure) makes me seriously suspect that he doesn't really know how to end this series.<br /><br />Oh well.  No hard feelings George.  It happens.  I get it.  I'm moving on.  Maybe IF the series is ever finished, and I hear enough glowing reviews from those who had the patience to stick with it, I may give it another go.  Until then though, this whole series gets chucked to the bookcase of shame in my garage.

B003ZTQN1I|3.0|I bought the CD a week after seeing the movie. I thought that the cast would be featured a lot more than they were on the soundtrack. I was very disappointed that it was just Faith Hill singing \\" Give Into Me\\". I loved the duet it the movie and it was a big part of the reason i bought the soundtrack. There were enough really good songs in the movie that they didn't really need to add all the others that weren't in the movie. Other than that it's a decent soundtrack.

After a few more listens, the songs have REALLY grown on me and I have about 10 of them on repeat.  You can tell by her songs that she's in love and singing from her heart.  I'll always be a Beyonce fan.  Good work B....keep it coming!!!
B0035OTPEK|5.0|Admittedly, it took me a few listens to really start to love this album, but once I realized what I was listening to, I can hardly stay away. Editors really accomplished creating a mood for this album that escalates track after track. A story unfolds with each song giving hints and pieces of a tale that is intentionally ambiguous so that you can draw your own conclusions. Even if trying to concoct meaning from the songs is not for you, it is still a musical stunner: the perfect album to crank in the car or in your living room. Highly recommend.

0451228375|4.0|Ken Follett's sequel to The Pillars of the Earth is 1014 pages of unforgettable reading. I can't remember when I enjoyed a sequel better. This book is set two-hundred years after the first novel. There is, however, a flaw in this novel that is a little annoying. There are way too many calamities, seemingly every ten pages or so. This, coupled with the Black Plague running amok, witchcraft trials, and everybody seeking revenge, had my head spinning. If you like lots of characters, this is your book. There are at least six or seven major characters and thirty minor characters. With all of these people involved, you really have to give Ken Follett kudos for character development. I felt love or hate for each one of them.<br /><br />The novel starts with four children witnessing a murderous conflict between a knight and two men at arms. The knight buries a secret letter and seeks asylum at the famous monastery at Kingsbridge, where he becomes a monk. The children Merthin, Ralph, Caris and Gwenda are forever tied together. Their trials and tribulations along with their families and the monks form the plot.<br /><br />As with the first book, the clergy are fighting for power. This time they are led by the evil prior Godwyn. Edmund Wooler leads a township looking for commerce and independence from the church. We have the battle between the good builder, Merthin, and the bad builder, Elfric. There are love stories: Merthin and Caris and Gwenda and Wulfric. We have the horrible Ralph Fitzgerald, later to become the Earl of Shiring. Then we have the \\"common sense\\" medical theories of Caris versus the blood letting monk doctors. Finally, there is  Prior Godwyn's sidekick, the scurrilous and conniving Philemon fighting for power and advancement.<br /><br />The book gives the reader a good idea of how it must have been to live in Medieval times. Can you imagine being bled every time you got sick? Being accused of heresy by a enemy could get you quickly hung? If you were clergy, grab the wrong shirt tails and face failure. Any noble had life and death power over the peasants along with unlimited taxation. As Charles Dickens wrote of a different time in A Tale of Two Cities, \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\"<br /><br />There are too many sub-plots to describe, so my advise is to get hold of a copy and start reading. I found this book to be the fastest thousand page book I've ever read. Is it better than The Pillars of the Earth? No, but I think it's close, which is saying a lot.

B000002IMG|4.0|The New Order is a minor classic.  Chuck Billy has always been one of the best, if not THE best vocalist to come out of the thrash metal genre.  On guitars Alex Skolnick brought a classical background which helps enhance the creepiness of this record.  Eric Peterson literally lives and breathes metal, he isn't \\"technically\\" the most proficient guitarist, but he clearly understands the art of the metal riff.  Louie Clemente is a not a very good drummer, but he pounds the drums hard and manages to get through the album.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Eerie Inhabitants\\" which showcases the classical guitar side of Skolnick.  The riffs are pure thrash, and the song is one of the catchiest of the bands career.  The title track \\"The New Order\\" is another showcase of pure thrash riffing, and skillful classically inspired leads by Skolnick.  \\"Trial By Fire\\" opens with another classic Skolnick lead, and it turns into another catchy thrash song.  Speaking of Skolnick, aside from all the amazing intros and mind bending solos he does throughout the record, he also showcases his skills in two instrumentals.  \\"Hypnosis\\" is practically a warmup compared to \\"Musical Death (A Dirge)\\".  I can declare with supreme confidence it is one of my favorite instrumentals of all time.  The centerpiece cut from this album might just be \\"Disciples of the Watch\\", the seminal Testament song.  The only things that hold this album from reaching five star potential are the horrid cover of the Aerosmith classic \\"Nobody's Fault\\", and \\"Into The Pit\\".  The latter is a by the numbers thrash song that seems tacked on to inspire nothing more then a mosh pit...are you surprised?  Otherwise most the material rates very strong to amazing in my opinion.  Highly recommended for casual to serious fans of thrash metal.

Third run it started at the wrong resolution.  Fourth run and since then has started fine.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee often wrote in her book how she didn't feel like anyone noticed her or cared because she stayed missing for so long.  I just wanted to write this review to show support to her and her family.  She is definitely not going unnoticed now.  She is someone to learn from, be inspired by- I'm inspired by her courage, her will to survive and her capacity to love despite what she has been through.  I was so moved by the connections she made with her animals before she had her kids and while she had them.  I know what it's like to love pets as family and then going through the heartbreak of losing them.  But I can just imagine that when you are all alone, can't trust the people around you, and you have these animals to care for who are the only beings treating you with respect and love, then to lose a beloved pet in that circumstance is unimaginable to me.  Jaycee's ability to survive all she did is amazing.  She is beautiful inside and out.  She is definitely noticed now, but hopefully not too much by those damn annoying paparazzi. ;)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This is the first and last app that I will buy from Amazon. I will stick w/the Droid market for purchases and downloads. When I attempted to download, I got all sorts of error messages and was not able to resolve. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to determine who from Amazon could help me resolve. So I just decided to let it go because it didn't cost that much. However I won't be using Amazon's market that's for sure.    I was able to successfully download the game from the Droid market and it's fun. I need this for those days I feel like vegging out.
B004WOJ7C2|4.0|After roughly 4 years, Sympohony X releases it's follow-up to it's quite successful Paradise Lost. From beignning to end, the album is enjoyable, and rather easy to listen to. However, in comparison to their previous album, it doesn't seem as well developed/thought out, as some songs seemed a bit rushed and lacked originality, and the lyrics were a bit repetitive. By that I mean that some songs sound like cliche metal songs, and some riffs can easily be traced back to other albums. Michael Romeo is a highly skilled guitarist by far, but the solos on this album are just a little too \\"balls-to-the-wall\\" in terms of sheer shredding, which can be great from time to time, but happens in nearly every song on the album.    My favorites from the album are: Iconoclast, When All Is Lost, Electric Messiah, and Reign In Madness.    This album has a lot of material, some it could probably do without and still prove to be a successful album.    In respect to the Vinyl version, it doesn't disappoint. It comes with great artwork, silver disks, and even a poster.  As with the Paradise Lost vinyl, the lyrics are the on the first disk sleeve, with the other sleeve containing a photo of the band and the various credits. Obviously with most vinyl releases, the sound is unmatched.     If your a Symphony X fan, like myself, then I can definately recommend this album, but if your a fan of the last album, don't expect it to be too mind blowing.
030745455X|4.0|This sequel is better than first but shares many of its flaws and would have benefited from serious editing, which I assume didn't happen because the author died. I was intrigued enough by Salander's character to read this sequel, despite the poor writing, repetition, and confusing cast of characters in the first book.<br /><br />\\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" wisely focuses on Salander, who is more interesting than the rather generic Blomkvist, and it has a faster-paced plot, although Salander's Caribbean adventures and forays into mathematics could have been cut. I don't mind that she's portrayed as an &uuml;ber-genius boxing champ/master of disguises/ninja, but her final showdown against the bad guys is almost comical. The book is also over-crowded with characters (a large assortment of police agents, private detectives, magazine staffers, friends, and bad guys) and uses the same clumsy omniscient point of view. Instead of the first book's endless descriptions of what sandwiches everyone was eating what time Blomkvist went for a jog, we get catalog-style description of Salander's Ikea furniture, meaningless directions and street names, and constant recapping of the plot as one character fills another in on what happened in the previous scene.<br /><br />Despite the extremely mediocre writing, I really like Salander. As unrealistic as she is, it's fun to watch a girl kick butt.
B003L77GRO|2.0|No subtitles for Season 4, just captions, which were a horrible jumble of missing and butchered words.  CaptionMax points finger at poor mastering--will the same morons be in charge once again?  How about doing some actual quality control, Showtime, or maybe even cough up some real subtitles this time around?
B000002JPA|5.0|This isn't just a classic Dream Theater album or a classic 90's album, this is a classic for the entire genre of progressive metal! It ranks right up there with Symphony X's Twilight in Olympus and The Odyssey, Kamelot's Karma and Epica, and Stratovarius' Visions and Elysium albums. It's absolutely incredible how good this is for only the 2nd release by this band (or any band for that matter!). I have their first album and with the discussion of James vs Charlie (the 2 singers with this band), I'd say that James has a good voice and it's good on a few of DT's albums but I don't like it all the time. Charlie has not as much range but a lot more passion and that's why he would've been better off staying with them, BUT this record IS one of the ones where James' voice fits in.    Now my thoughts on this album's music:    1. \\"Pull Me Under\\"- The hit of the album and a very good song IMO. I just like the beat of this song and the opening is just awesome.    2. \\"Another Day\\"- A ballad but a very nice ballad. I seriously love the sax in it and the melody of it. Although for a ballad, Portnoy is drumming quite heavily (for what the beat is: simple).    3. \\"Take the Time\\"- Another favorite of mine. I love the beat and the chorus of this one. A very nice vocal job by James because I feel the emotion in this one. And the rest of the band (well they are always talented so I really don't need to say anything about the band itself).    4. \\"Surrounded\\"- A nice softer song and I love the atmosphere it creates.    5. \\"Metropolis Pt. 1, The Miracle and the Sleeper\\"- I like this song but I didn't really like it at first. As always, the music is superb.    6. \\"Under a Glass Moon\\"- My vote for best song on the album. This one hits you like a train. Literally, this is one hard rockin' song with a killer drum beat and a nice melody all at the same time.    7. \\"Wait for Sleep\\"- A haunting piano part with James singing. Only Kevin and James are involved in this song and it's an ok song. This is my least favorite on the album but it's still good.    8. \\"Learning to Live\\"- It starts off with a nice little melody and the music is very progressive on this song. Nice job guys!    Verdict: If you're into progressive rock and want to give Progressive metal a try, this is the perfect album to start with (this is what I did). Or if You're a DT fan and don't have this, then by all means, stop reading this and BUY IT! And if you like progressive metal and you've never ever heard this album before, then I don't know why you haven't heard it. GET IT! I mean it; This is awesome progressive metal!
1451629184|5.0|This is a very easy read and also very hard. She goes into graphic details of her abduction and forced sexual relationship with her captor.  The abuse physical, mental, verbal and sexual were horrendous and just made me physically ill.      She's a strong woman for surviving it all and is now thriving today. I do think everyone who is mature and can handle descriptive graphic details should read this.  It teaches very important lessons.    I read it in 5 hours.
B004LWZW24|4.0|I'm going to review this movie in two parts; because that's how it seemed to play. (The séance scene is where I separate the two.)  The first part is as frightening as anything I've seen since the Exorcist. It's that creepy. The second half turns, for some reason, into part \\"Suspiria\\", part Amusement Park spook ride. This abrupt change of direction doesn't kill the thrill or detract from of the overall pace of the film but, it does downgrade it from a \\"perfect 10\\" to solid 8. Maybe 9.    Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell, who collaborated on both Saw (2004) & Dead Silence (2007), struck horror gold on this one. It's the kind of horror film that's best viewed alone and at night with the lights out if you can brave it. (As most of the great ones are)    Not at all a blood bath and without the stereotypical scantily clad teens in distress, this PG13, 103 min creep-fest takes the viewer on a ride that will leave you turning your lights on to get safely to bed.    The first half is a totally original haunted house spine tingling journey in and of itself and than you are catapulted into a dream like state of horrific illusion and visual Menagerie.    Drawling from \\"Poltergeist\\", \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"The Changeling\\", Insidious is destined to achieve it's deserved position in the top horror films of history.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|OK, maybe it's not Oscar-worthy, and there are a few holes and predictable events here and there.  Overall, though, it's a fun flick with some decent effects and a good concept.  Based on the book (which I will read next to get any back stories), the story takes us into a coming of age tale for a kid who only knows half his story.  Through some adventures, and life-and-death situations, he comes to know his capabilities, and a few life lessons too (naturally).    The ending sort of left me wanting more, so perhaps they will film the next book about number 6?    Anyway, if you enjoy fantasy-based-in-reality type stories with just a touch of sci-fi, and some good popcorn-action, check this one out!
B001EC3JME|1.0|What few reviews I write are positive. This flashlight holder (no company makes one that works) is worthless. I can't fit a mini-light in it. My single battery, AAA fits tightly; my AA flashlights fit only after struggling with them. A C or D battery light will simply not work. I will throw this in the trash.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|For several years Shania has been my \\"going home Friday night\\" music that I play in the car in that horrible Friday night traffic.  It is so upbeat and fun and gets me ready for the weekend.  When a couple of my CDs went missing I bought this album and love it.  The best hits and all my favorites.  Just the right music to set fun, easy going mood.
0062060554|4.0|Although I found the book to be a real page turner and did not want to put it down, after it was over, there were too many things that didn't add up for me. If you're willing to suspend reality a bit to buy the premise and its conclusion, you'll enjoy the book.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|.........Symphony X releases \\"Iconoclast.\\"  Wow.  They continue to reinvent themselves, yet retain some flavor from the earlier releases. I can only say this:  I hope there is not so long a wait between this release and the next one.  Incredible..........
159514188X|5.0|I'm sure most of you guys have already read this book. It's been a day after I finished this book and I'm still in this shocked mood. I can't believe I didn't read this sooner. I remember years ago wanting to read it, but it wasn't until this year that I bought it. I'm so glad I did!     The book tells the story of Hannah, a girl that committed suicide and recorded on tapes the reasons of why she did it. The reasons are persons and how they affected her. The tapes have to be passed on to the next person on the list and if they don't pass them on, Hannah said someone would make them public, and that would cause problems for the people on the list.     The book is told from Clay Jensen's point of view. (I love his last name!) Clay is the good guy and he's had a crush on Hannah for some time and he doesn't know why he's on the list of tapes. And you want to find out why he made the list, too. He does a really good job of explaining everything that's going on, at least, what he knows. And there's always the mistery of who is next and what they did to Hannah. It keeps you flipping the pages, that's for sure.     This book, I don't even know what to say about it. It touched me so deep, that still now when I think about it, it gives me this feeling of sadness.     Sometimes you feel like the reasons Hannah had for doing what she did weren't really that big of a deal, but at the same time, you get it. You get why she did it and how she felt. And the thing is that she understands it, too. She knows she could have acted or done things differently, but she was just at that point in her life where she couldn't take it. She couldn't keep fighting against everything that went wrong in her life.     What made this book more amazing was that you could actually listen to part of the tapes on YouTube and it gave you chills. It made the book more realistic.     I liked everything about this book. I can't get it out of my head. And yeah, I cried. If you have doubts about this book, don't. Just pick it up. Trust me, you won't regret it.
B004MNVKVO|4.0|This new Audio Lossless Format is revolutionary. What Blu Ray has done to Video; Lossless Audio is doing to Audio. It's called lossless because there is 0 Distortion. It is unmeasurable with test equipment. The sound is just totally clean and wide open. The Rush material lends itself well to this format. Distortion can not get any better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What could possibly be said about Hunger Games that hasn't already been said? Suzanne Collins paints a dystopian future that's easy to get swept away in. I watched the movie \\"Battle Royale\\" before reading Hunger Games, and yes, the stories are similar. Children and selected to participate in \\"the hunger games\\" where they are forced to fight to the death. Move over Edward and Bella, because Katniss and Peeta are an unforgettable pair!    Apart from Harry Potter, there is no young adult series better than The Hunger Games!
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|This series i loved from start to finish. But in forever it could have had a way better ending. My idea was for the ending that Sam would propose to Grace. It was a good book but needed a better ending
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|The book started out fairly entertaining. I skipped over many parts that gave a blow by blow review of 30 Rock and in the end was quite disapointed with my purchase.<br /><br />I had expected to learn more about Ms. Fey and not relive every scene of SNL and 30 Rock...<br /><br />My advise... wait until this book appears on a discount shelf at RiteAid and then buy it...
B00447G2PM|4.0|On my quest to find 3D content I decided to purchase this movie, being a fan of the ocean world I thought that this would be a fine addition to my growing 3D collection. I found the movie to be one of the best 3d tittles I've experienced so far, with solid 3D special effects and a strong enough content to keep you from complaining. My only issue arises with the length of the movie, it's simply too short for the amount of money spend on it.  I do understand that it is a documentary and not a real movie, but just as you are starting to get more involved into the movie, the closing credits start to roll. Narration was kind of slow, could of been much better. But overall it's a solid 3D tittle to own.
0553381695|3.0|Nicely plotted with a plethora of well drawn characters, but his commitment to equal opportunity POV storytelling makes this a tedious read. So many cliffhangers involving the busy characters followed by multiple chapters of ennui from characters essentially doing nothing. The sword is at the Kingslayer's throat! But first let's spend another 40 pages with Daenerys waiting for her baby dragons to grow up! I'm sure I'm not the only reader who would have been glad to just spend the whole book with sly, witty, basically humane Tyrion.
1451629184|5.0|This book is a very easy read in that it's hard to put down and can be easily finished in a day or two. If you don't want to read the details of her abuse at the hands of her abductor maybe this book isn't for you, but the book is an amazing account of Jaycee's survival skills and her recovery once she got out.    I also found a lot of life's lessons to be learned from her for anyone of any age. Once you get passed the horror of her abduction and abuse you'll find the book very uplifting and also understand why she didn't take the opportunity to escape when she could.
0553801473|4.0|I've read all the other reviews.  I understand why people are aggrieved.  But, frankly, I'm in absolute adoration of this book.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because while others have complained of no forward movement in the story, no \\"action\\", no big battles and a lot of sailing, horseback riding and other forms of ASOIAF travel, I have to say that it's exactly what a fan of world-building like me was hoping for in the middle book of the series.<br /><br />This book, along with its conjoined twin, A Feast For Crows, is the \\"Order of the Phoenix\\"/\\"Two Towers\\" of this world.  And it's the perfect time to give more detail on the other lands we have heard about but not met.  Remember how the first book had you hating certain characters, but by book 3 you \\"knew\\" them better and had perhaps grown quite fond of them?  This book does for the WORLD of ASOIAF what the first three books did for the characters.  It lays it out in a travelogue style.  Through the eyes of various voyagers we learn vastly more about the Free Cities, The North and other parts of the ASOIAF globe.<br /><br />It's a canard to say that \\"nothing happens\\".  Perhaps if you think things are only happening if there is much clanging of swords and shields and explosions of Wildfyre then, yeah.  \\"Nothing\\" happens.  Instead there are many SOMETHINGS happening.  Characters are developing.  Political alliances that have lasted for centuries are being reshaped, sometimes abruptly.<br /><br />This is not a loud, boisterous, bellicose book.  This is a Maester's sort of book, a compendium of myth, lore, medicine, politics.  It's the kind of book that I expect will make the cataclysmic wars in the last books more flavourful.  Because now they will be set against a glorious tapestry, not dropped into a void.  I'm sorry those who are more enthralled with action comics are disappointed.  I am overjoyed.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|my dad was telling me about a public tv station had a music show for donations. Robert Plant and The Band of Joy were the spot light of the show and he realy seemed to enjoy it. he grew up on led zeppelin and i listened to it too. so this new cd is realy cool! its almost a folky kinda take on the classic led zeppelin sound. its quite amazing, Mr.Plant's vocals sound as good as his days in his old band. great songs and melodys. i like track 4 Silver Rider the most. very cool.
0312600844|5.0|I've not been a Jonathon Franzen fan until now. I didn't like the people in Corrections which spoiled the book for me. On the first page of Freedom I was already very worried I was about to repeat the same experience. I'm very happy I persevered. Last night, I finished the final page with tears in my eyes.<br /><br />What a remarkable novel. It's the author's layering, who the people are over decades, that enchants. Childhood & its impact on bad choices is particularly well done. One reviewer on Amazon complained he didn't believe \\"a 47 yr. old hasn't had a taste of beer\\". He is ignoring the ugliness of Walter growing up with a mean alcoholic, thats what made it believable.<br /><br />People are surprising in their choices, it's a huge part of my delight in listening to people's stories.<br /><br />The layering over time creates complex characters that are three-dimensional. I believe irony in people's lives is very important to understand. So of course Walter, the man with moral standards, gets seduced in D.C. by strip mining interests and in his denial he buys the idea, it's all o.k because he'll create a sanctuary for a warbler.<br /><br />Good men fall victim to bad choices, it is such a human thing to do. It's why preachers get caught with prostitutes which has never surprised me after working with people for more than 35 years.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is the authors' ability to show us how mistakes are a huge part of our lives. We are so determined not to make the same parenting mistakes our parents made with us, just like Patty. Then we go ahead and make different ones that are still problematic.<br /><br />We have the freedom of choices and so often we screw it up. It can take decades to truly learn what love is when you've convinced yourself of the myth you chose the wrong man.<br /><br />Freedom of choice includes disastrously bad choices. The wisdom of choice has to be earned by the pain of experiencing mistakes. This adds to the authenticity because it's just like real life.<br /><br />Part of accepting our humanity is to smile knowingly at how confusing life and relationships are. We try to understand what's right and what's wrong and it turns out the real truth takes time to surface and maybe it's the opposite of what we obsessively decided previously.<br /><br />The characters are full of the flaws we all have and they learn to endure, just like us.y is to smile knowingly at how confusing life and relationships are.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|This is meant as a compliment and here's why; Yes has always been my favorite band, my favorite album/CD of all time is Close To The Edge, which is also my favorite song. Point being, I am a fan, as big as they come. No matter what line up, no matter what critical reviewers said, I was there, buying each and every new release, and seeing them live almost 20 times, including the current line up. I also am a big fan of Jon, Steve and Chris solo work. When Drama was released in 1980 I felt like a traitor, because I loved this album! Did I miss Jon, his voice, and his mystical lyrics, sure. I even wished they called the band anything but Yes, but they chose to forge ahead under that logo, so I bought in. Man, do I love Drama! It is to me one of the top 5 Yes releases, and after one listen to Fly From Here I felt like I had been delivered Drama Part II.  The music is angular and powerful, the recording is clean and vibrant, without the bombast they typically get accused of. The voicing comes closer to Drama than anything Jon would have done, yet there remain hints of the familiar when hearing the fills Steve contributes, the running bass lines from Chris, and the harmonies. It is at once comfortable, and challenging, taking us away from the formula and asking us to accept the new direction, while interweaving a tribute to their collective past. I no longer feel badly for loving Drama, I would have bought it and enjoyed it just the same no matter what label it bore, the same can be said for this release; call it what you want, but they chose to call it Yes. Unless you hated Drama, or can only accept Yes with Jon, buy this immediately and enjoy them for as long as we can. Too many groups have come and gone, leaving behind glimpses of potential (U.K. comes to mind, as I would love for there to be more music available from them), so lets be grateful and take while they continue to create. \\"Seasons will pass you by...\\"
B004G606K8|3.0|The book was recommended by a friend who is a huge fan of the entire series. He swears by these books, so I decided to give it a try. Personally, I found it so-so. The writing was overly fast paced and the bridges between scenes either didn't exist or were abrupt. You can get lost easily, and sometimes it can be a strain to remember who was what or why a certain city was important. This happens when you have such a vast world and lore, though. There's so much to introduce and you can only get seemingly unimportant or unhelpful tidbits at first. But there's always the promise of more in the future lurking with each random piece of information.<br />  Character development was at a minimum, but you were presented with a stellar cast from the get go. There is no denying that this is a unique band of interesting characters. Even years later, you just don't find characters like this. But the fighting and the bickering can be a bit draining. The comic relief character is adorable and definitely funny, but when the rest of the cast finds him annoying, you can't help but feel a little bit of the humor taken out of it. From an emotional standpoint, this is stellar writing. You really feel the nerves at their breaking point and the misery of the travelers...but that really isn't something people enjoy feeling.<br />  Of course, there's more to this story than the first book. Whether you want to continue..that's its own story. I can say that there are some great scenes in the book. The fight scenes are worth the read alone. Also, this series has an amazingly large family of books to fall into. Even though I wasn't a huge fan of this novel, I look forward to some of the other books in the universe, not al lof which are by the same authors.
B004Y1USJE|2.0|It's not solely about line-up changes. Yes has often got a shot of creativity when they brought new members into the fold. The departure of Rick Wakeman and the addition of Patrick Moraz was a good thing,--producing Relayer--one of the best Yes albums of all time. And of course, there's the whole 90215 era. Either love it or hate it, it marked a unique time with a rejuvenated and contemporary sounding Yes. Even Drama was a great album. Benoit David is a perfectly fine Yes vocalist and he does better singing this new material than singing the Yes catalog. That being said, this new release is just not very good.  And as much as we might want to believe this is a good Yes album,  wishing will not make it so.  Magic has not struck twice with Trevor Horn who has not bought this incarnation of Yes into this new day and age. Older songs are rehashed and reworked here. In order to pique the interests of die hard Yes fans they open with a multi-part suite. But they're ever so loosely joined together and do not feel like a cohesive, well conceived whole piece. All songs lack energy, variety or a unique discovery. They complete the package by putting out a Roger Dean cover and then cross their fingers hoping we will \\"buy\\" it. But this is a sub-par effort all around. This is Yes running on fumes. We hold Yes to a higher standard because they have produced such inspired and creative music over the many years. But times change. We get older and loose the youthful abandon. Ideas aren't as easy to catch. Record company support and fan base dwindle. As witnessed at a recent live concert, the Yes men looked bloated and tired (Steve Howe just looked tired.) I hope this is not their swan song as one would wish them to go out on a high note. I don't count them out completely because they have rebounded in the past. And I suspect at some point Jon Anderson will return. But time is getting short and after a ten year recording absence, if this is the best they can come up with, then we mayall be in for a bumpy ride.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Rarely does a movie make me sad when it ends, but I was honestly sad when the credits began to role! But not because of something bad, but because this movie was so fantastic! I loved Meryl as Julia, she had the voice down perfectly, and Amy was too cute, almost too cute for being Julie Powel..... from what ive heard, she isnt as nice and sweet as portrayed in the movie... For once the movie is 10000x better than the book! The book had way ttoo much swearing, and not much on cooking, mostly it was her personal life. But this movie, I would recomend any day. I love how they edit it, to go from Julia Child in Paris 40-50 years ago, to Julie in Queens, NY. The ending was awesome, and not much happened, I just personally believe it was amazing. BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!! Its worth it, trust me!
B002WTC92E|2.0|I finished this book last night and not quite sure how to feel about it. There were moments in the book that were funny but definitely not memorable. The timeline in the book is confusing and it's unclear how much time has gone by between each chapter. The characters were whiny, selfish, and bland. I kept waiting for the book to get better but it didn't. I read a few chapters before I slept each night and the only good thing about this book was it's ability to put me straight to sleep.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I love these shoes! My first pair, and a great pair to begin with. Don't wear them everyday, because they need at lease every other day to 'reat' or they will start to stink. Love the message and the fact that they give a pair to needy kids too. Thanks again, TOMS!<br />-Charlotte
0375842209|5.0|What would you steal to survive?  Would it be food?  Clothing?  Well, for Liesel Meminger it is books!  As narrated by Death himself, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, is a story about Liesel Meminger, a young, poor German girl growing up during World War II in Nazi-Germany.  Liesel stole her first book, The Grave Digger's Handbook, quite by accident on her way to live her foster family.  Her foster family consists of her loving, accordion-playing father, Hans, and her acid-tongued mother, Rosa, who is always swearing at people calling them `Saumensch' and `Saukerl' (basically translated as `filthy pigs').  Liesel doesn't even know how to read, but with the help Hans, and to pass the time, she soon learns how and more importantly comes to learn the true power of words.      The Book Thief takes you on a journey of what it may have been like to live during World War II as a family like Liesel's, who doesn't support the Nazi Party, but doesn't want to attract attention to themselves either.  It shows the difficulties you may have faced when you're expected to attend school with the Hitler Youth, burn books on Hitler's birthday, and play soccer with the neighborhood children, but keep the the Jewish refugee hiding in your basement a secret!  In time, and with the help of some friends (the boy Rudy, the Jewish refugee Max, and the mayor's wife), Liesel \\"acquires\\" more books and more words.  You will learn that words can be powerful and sometimes, are the only things you need to survive.    This was an excellent book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with the appropriate maturity level to read it!

0316056863|4.0|Most people are not cut out to be authors, but if their message is good, I'm willing to forgive them of that.     For all the 1 - 2 star reviews that said she is a terrible writer? Really?! who cares? Her writing style is not amazing, but it's not bad either. I've read much, much worse by amateur authors. Have you ever read Chelsea Handler's books? now there is a prime example of trash that is both unfunny and un-readable at the same time. She makes Tina Fey seem amazing by comparison.     the IMPORTANT thing is that this book was SO FUNNY! She had me cracking up constantly. it was a great light read for a summer afternoon.     to all the haters: not every book has to be a Pulitzer Prize winner. sometimes I just want to be entertained.
B001FOPODS|5.0|One of the most exquisite and hugely talented animated films I have ever seen!   Wonderful for all ages!
B0026OR2PE|4.0|The Myths of Innovation, by Scott Berkun, is an interesting read. In this book he argues that the word innovation is overused, and that true innovation is a hard thing. He provides examples of true innovators, (Ford, Edison, Jobs, Brin and Paige) and explains how we build myths around the men.    I really enjoyed Berkun's take on the term innovation. He does a wonderful job of persuading the reader that innovation isn't just something that you do on a daily basis, but that it's more of a process. I found his arguments compelling. There were many thought provoking points, and I think my favorite was \\"Creativity has more to do with being fearless than intelligent or any other adjective superficially associated with it.\\" His arguments and examples helped me to sort of \\"meta-think\\", or think about the ways that people think about the world. I think the most eye-opening parts of the book are when he tries to shed the aura of mystique from around the innovators of the past and the present. One of the points he made is that there's no magic moment of innovation - as humans we just build up the idea that there was one magic moment when Bell invented the telephone, or Newton discovered gravity, or Copernicus developed his heliocentric theory. However, Berkun pulls these mythical figures off their pedestals and reveals them for what they are - successful, talented, somewhat lucky, and very hardworking individuals.    I think that anyone who has ideas should read this book. If you want to invent something, or be the next Mark Zuckerberg, then you should read the Myths of Innovation. If you are a knowledge worker (programmer, artist, etc. - or if you just want to be one), you should read this book. In the Myths of Innovation, Scott Berkun busts the myths that you probably believe right now, and it will challenge the way you think.

I am sad that this is the last Harry Potter film but these movies will go down as classics. All of the actors and actresses did a fabulous job and I can't believe the cast stayed together for a decade. Fans will surely love this movie as much as I did. Go see it!
B000MZHW4A|4.0|This movie had a good story full of danger and intrigue as it portrayed Africans against Africans, including the kidnapping of children who were then brainwashed to join violent gangs.  It showed what one father would go through to recover his son from one of these gangs and how that could only be possible because of the diamond he found and the corrupt government leader who wanted it.  The characters were believable and the actors playing them worked well together in this.
034544678X|5.0|My sister, who is a vet with a special interest in animal behavior, gave me my first copy of this book.  And now I keep copies on hand to give to my friends and clients who have dogs, would like to have dogs or just like dogs!  It is full of interesting and sometimes surprising (who knew that most dogs don't REALLY like to be patted on the head?!) information and is illustrated with great photos of real people and their dogs.  And it is written in a way that makes you feel like you are having a relaxed, funny conversation with a friend.
0425241505|4.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />The Wyrkind include dragons, gryphons, and other shape shifters.  Dragos is a huge dragon who was created before humans existed.  He's ruler of the Wyrkind and lives in New York City.  He has huge stashes of treasure, some buried under the NY subways.  One of his enemies is the Dark Fae King Urien who lives in Chicago.  Dragos has a truce with the Elves in the southern U.S.<br /><br />Pia's mother was Wyr, her father human.  Pia has an ability with locks.  She touches locks and they open.  After her mother died, she found comfort in boyfriend Keith and told him about her ability.  Keith bragged about this to the wrong people.  To settle his gambling debts he was given a \\"finding charm\\" and was told to use Pia to steal something from Dragos.  He then blackmailed Pia into doing it, telling her he would give away her secrets if she didn't.  So Pia used the charm and was able to get through Dragos' locks.  She stole one penny from his stash.  She then purchased a binding spell to stop Keith from ever talking about her again.  Then she went on the run, fearing for her life.<br /><br />After Dragos discovered the theft his roar frightened the city, and he destroyed millions of dollars in property with his temper tantrum.  He became obsessed with finding the thief.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I think this is the first dragon romance book that I've liked.  The main draw is the character Dragos.  He is obsessed with Pia.  He wants her and only her.  He doesn't know how to treat someone he loves.  She has to tell him to say please.  At times his ownership, jealousy, and protectiveness overwhelm him, and she calms him down.  There is a cute scene on pages 75-76 about her calming him down so he won't suffer further damage from an enemy.  It was unexpectedly fun because she was his prisoner at the time.  I enjoyed watching their relationship.  The sex scenes were good. He was a softie - wanting her pleasure.  He washed her hair, found special food for her, and gave her a credit card (which she didn't want).<br /><br />The first half of the book was the best.  The last half was ok but was a little bit of a letdown.  Things weren't as exciting or special.  But I liked it enough to order the sequel \\"Storm's Heart\\" coming August 2011 about Tricks (Fae) and Tiago (Wyr).  \\"Dragon Bound\\" is the first in the Elder Races series.<br /><br />A minor negative was Pia doing something stupid which allowed the bad guy to get her.  I would have preferred the bad guy being super smart instead of the heroine doing something stupid.  But this wasn't as bad as a lot of others.<br /><br />I noticed one reviewer did not like Dragos being an ancient guy \\"speaking in a modern fashion.\\"  I say this is FICTION.  Nothing needs to be historically or factually accurate.  (He can shapeshift for heaven's sake!)  The important things are enjoying and being engaged which this does well.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Story length: 312 pages.  Swearing language: strong.  Sexual language: strong.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|I've seen Yes in concert multiple times, and own all the studio albums except Union, which is the only one I don't like. I also own 5 live albums and 4 live DVDs. I am a big Yes fan and have been since the mid 1990's...which is when I first heard the albums Close To The Edge, Tales From Topographic Oceans, and Relayer. Until now, the albums I played the most are Fragile, Close To The Edge, Tales From Topographic Oceans, Relayer, and Drama.<br /><br />My opinions: Listen to this album at least 5 times before you review it.<br />I think this is the best Yes album in the last 30 years. Almost 30 years ago is when 90125 came out..a huge hit and a great, classic album. There are songs on 90125 I love. Overall I enjoy this album more than 90125.<br /><br />....and the Fly From Here album artwork is superb. In fact, it's my favorite Yes album artwork ever.<br /><br />The \\"no Wakeman, no Yes\\" comments are ridiculous. TONY KAYE is the original Yes keyboardist and played on the first THREE albums, including the well-known classic The Yes Album, not Rick Wakeman. Tony also was the Yes keyboardist on 90125, Big Generator, and Talk.<br /><br />Geoff Downes - keyboards -  is fantastic on this album, as he was on the Drama album, and my opinion is he is at his very best when playing with Yes. My opinion is this is the best album performance by Geoff Downes, ever.<br /><br />This album, Fly From Here, is absolutely now and will be on my most played Yes albums list.<br /><br />Fly From Here....excellent album. 5 stars.
142314189X|5.0|I have not yet read the Percy Jackson novels even though my daughter has this excellent boxed set.  That's not because I'm not interested - far from it.  The problem is that my eight-year old is as attached to these books as Charlton Heston was to his rifle, and she's re-reading these books at such a rapid clip that she has no interest in sharing.<br /><br />My current quest is to find another book or series to distract her from Percy's adventures, and so far I have been unsuccessful.<br /><br />So why am I writing this review?  Unlike any other books my daughter has read, her reading of the Percy Jackson novels has been extremely active.  She will sit for ages poring over the books, ignoring everything around her, and then suddenly sprint over to the computer to Google the latest goddess, titan, or monster Percy has encountered.  She's already picked out next year's Halloween costume (Artemis narrowly beat out Athena).  She lectured me on why a Medusa is more dangerous than a giant.  I cannot evaluate the wisdom of her conclusions, but I cannot deny the intensity of her concern that I might some day be turned to stone unless I keep my wits about me.<br /><br />No other books have captured my daughter's imagination like Percy Jackson, and she's read a fair amount.  So if you're a parent looking for a good boxed set to keep you kids occupied, I have to give this series the highest marks.
140053271X|4.0|Pros:     Touch screen  Excellent battery life  Sized well for pockets or purses  The gestures are pretty intuitive  The functionality of ePub books is very good  The device is able to use books from other sources who use ePub or PDF format (library or other source    Cons:     The on-board memory capacity is 236MB (!)  Menu / keyboard items are not scalable  No parental filters / controls  No on board method to manage files or memory usage  The small screen size decreases reading continuity at larger text sizes; no ability to view text in Landscape  Apparently, Amazon really prefers you buy the Kindle, observing they are offering the NOOK for $40 more than for the price it is offered at Barnes and Noble.    Summary:     I own a Kindle and a NOOK Touch. As I inventory the features, the NOOK seems to be superior. The reason is fundamentally that the navigation is made supremely more intuitive with the touch screen. The on-screen keyboard / menu items are actually useful to the consumers who really could benefit from these devices more than anyone: the elderly. The keyboard, being onscreen, is highly readable, though there is no adjustment for typeface variation or size to resolve reading difficulty, which seems to render other accommodations for the visually impaired redundant. What use is it to adjust the text inside the book, if it is difficult to read the menu and to navigate to the book in the first place? Though it is worth saying again, all items are indeed highly readable even without the adjustment capacity on the menu / keyboard levels. It is an improvement over the Kindle, which has the same weakness compounded with the static keyboard with low-contrast printed letters thereupon, and a more complicated menu system.    When looking through the documentation that accompanies the device, and at BN.com, there is absolutely NO mention of the built-in memory whatsoever. 236MB is not a good selling point, but I find this evasive to completely hide this attribute from the consumer until having the device in hand and navigating the settings. It tarnishes my opinion of Barnes & Noble. Were it not for the overall superiority of this device over others, I would question whether or not to do business with them. That said, the \\"offense\\" is offset in part because I feel that most folks who would consider owning this device will already have a memory expansion on hand, probably left over after upgrading from early models of smartphones or cameras.    There is no way to set the \\"default\\" storage to your memory expansion. The only method I have discovered to direct how memory is utilized without hacking the device is by connecting / synchronizing with a computer and manually placing files in the preferred locations.    What really sold me on this device was the touch screen, intuitive / simple menu system, and its ability to use books borrowed from the library. The menus and on-screen keyboard functions, and the basic functions were learned within 2 weeks by my very elderly great-aunt. She had never before used a similar computerized device, though the learning curve is similar to that of a microwave oven. I believe this speaks well to the design team, though also indicates room for improvement.    Regarding the \\"Social\\" features of the NOOK Touch: this is generally a nice feature. One can synchronize with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, posting commentary and inviting discussion and response to the material being shared. THE DOWN SIDE is that this is only supported if Barnes and Noble actually sold the book to the user. Side-loaded material is not up for discussion.    There is a lightly functional Web browser embedded in the Search function of the NOOK Touch. It is basically the equivalent of a Mobile Web browser. I have had some mixed success with it. It does work, though I have found it to be rather unstable. Of the 5 tests I've run with it, It has caused the device to crash on 2. This was navigating the mobile version of Facebook.It was not advertised as a feature at all, so the fact that it exists is kind of an Easter Egg. Things to note with it are that the pages it loads are more difficult to read, since the Web is rendered in color and when rendering into gray scale the contrast tends to be low. However, it is useful to look up information in books that may be linked, or to post commentary on your Facebook / Google / Twitter accounts.    One item which might prove important to a few, which I discovered to my disappointment is that the NOOK will not recognize a WiFi access point created by your cell phone. I realize that this is not likely a highly common issue, but it was an assumption I had made before purchasing the device for my great-aunt. This issue is not specifically the NOOK. It is because the NOOK is running on Android (according to the developers of the WMWifiRouter application). That said, the Kindle is also unable to access the Internet in this fashion. It's speculative to say whether or not this is a security measure based on my information set, but it is an issue that I'm sure at least a few others will wish to have known before purchasing.    A case is a worthwhile consideration. Carrying the NOOK in one's pocket can create some issues with the touch screen, and it tends otherwise to cause the device to crash. However, I find that the so-called fashionable cases are absurdly priced. Consider at least two things before purchasing such items: they are made from cardboard wrapped in fabric; they are being offered for between $20 and $50. If you have an ambitious child, or an impulse to manufacture a cover with the same or better functionality as the covers available for the device, it is absolutely worthwhile to pursue that angle.    I would consider buying this device again given the offerings on the market now.
B004LWZW2E|2.0|Because there are people out there who might believe this could really happen. Out of body traveling. This is a cross betweeh Potergeist, Amityville Horror and a little of The Exorcist. It kept me on the edge of my seat hoping something really scary was going to happen. Forget that. A couple scenes were good. The demon with the red face and the fork tongue was interesting. The people with the stupid grins were good as well but that was all I liked about this movie. The whole concept of a person traveling out of his or hers body. without being dead is fiction. I bought the Blu-Ray hoping it would really make the movie good. No chance. I want my $19.99 back. If paranormal mumbo jumbo stupidity is your thing then this movie is de-finitely for you other wise pass on it.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|I haven't been spooked out by a horror movie in a very long time. I will have to buy this one eventually. It is in my top 5 scariest movies of all time. Great haunted/possession movie with good acting, script and directing.
B00000269M|5.0|Perfect;  thank you.
B0031R5K68|5.0|Although not as good as previous titles, The Lost Symbol still has it's jaw dropping moments and clever puzzles. Recommend to read it.
B003KI6A3U|4.0|Writing a review of this classic book and trying to find something to say about it that hasn't already been said many times before might not be the easiest of tasks. However, I felt that I needed to mention one thing about this highly-acclaimed and truly wonderful writing that may not have yet been addressed. Reading this book now, as an adult, it hit me almost immediately that its narration, done by Scout (Jean Louise), one of the main characters, who at the time of the story is seven-years old and by the story's conclusion, she is 10, yet she speaks within this book as though she's an adult. The story's intent was to be told through the eyes of a child - and with just a few exceptions, like when Scout finds herself in court when her father, Atticus, partakes in the trial of a young black man accused of raping a white girl, or addresses that she doesn't really understand what 'rape' is ... she is narrating through the entire book in terminology like that of an adult, and a very intelligent and thought-out conversational one at that. I found that to be hard to believe.    Don't get me wrong - the story is amazing, written in such a way that one feels what they feel and sees what they see, experiences what they experience - very realistically written as well as emotionally and psychologically understanding. However, such a little girl as Scout is, it is highly unlikely that a child that young would really be able to explain law and life in such an adult manner as this little girl's narration presents. Otherwise, the book is magnificent and I highly recommend anyone who hasn't read it, to read it.     As a writer, I've always been taught that if one is writing narration by supposedly a child, or an old person, one of a different ethnicity, or whichever way the story is to flow, then one must write the character's narrative in such a way that befits that kind of person so the story is realistic. I realize that this book is an \\"adult story\\" seen through the eyes of a child - therefore, much of her narration language/interaction thoughts, etc. with the other characters of the book should also be in a more child-like way. The story would be expressed that way, too. Perhaps more of the intenser explaining would have to be done in the dialogue of the adult characters, but a child is a child - they speak and think in their own way, also presenting a story through their own unique way.     I have not seen the movie, but the book is a very powerful story of life in a quiet southern town that identify with the unfairness of those times, accusation of a crime judged wrongfully and how so many people's lives are affected and misdirected as a result. I do encourage both young and old to read it if you haven't already.
006190385X|5.0|after reading many things about these lads,this is for the most part closest to accuracy that one will read. After knowing them for a very long time (lived outside Dublin )I can attest to the history and honesty they included. Of course, some private info was not included, as should be by anyone, no matter what your statis in life! Very good read.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I rarely sit still these days, but when I played this disc for the first time, I found myself totally engrossed in the moment. Adele's voice was full of heart and emotion without sounding fake, the music reminded me of some of the 60's music my mom used to play. So many singers seem to mumble, so it was nice to hear the lyrics clearly for a change. I wish her lots of success with this one; already looking forward to her next release.
1439165645|3.0|If you aren't into food it will be difficult to understand most of the food and culinary references in the book. (I'm into food and there was a lot terms I didn't know.)     Morais gives the reader a behind the scenes look into Haute Cuisine; the food, the restaurants, the chefs, the critics, and the business side of the restaurant \\"business.\\"  All of this is shown through the eyes of a native Indian chef, Hassan Haji, who is trying to make his way to the top of the highly competitive culinary world in his adopted city of Paris while trying to stay true to himself.    This novel is destined to become a movie.  The author, Richard Morais, says in his acknowledgements that he hopes someday it will become a film, and I have no doubt it will.  The book itself is almost like a screenplay-not a lot of depth to the characters, lots of visuals of opulent restaurants and food, easy and predictable plot line.  These are not criticisms of the book per se, because I did enjoy it for what it was, an entertaining little read, but I think it might actually be one of those rare books that makes a better movie than a novel.  (I absolutely see Dame Judy Dench as the quintessential snobby French chef and hotelier, Madame Mallory!)    Foodies will eat this little morsel of a book up, but others may want to wait for the movie version.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I used this video for a week, and I saw results quickly. I lost 1/2\\" off of each thigh. I found this video to be incredibly challenging, and I loved that. Each day I felt myself getting stronger. I couldn't even make it through the first level when I started, but by day 7 I had no problems with endurance. Unfortunately, my knees were a different story.    I know the proper form for squats. I actually do a fair amount of powerlifting with a good number of heavy squats. I do it 2-3 times a week, and I've done it for almost 2 years. I trained with incredibly strong men with good form, so I know the importance of not letting the knee go over the toe during a squat. I could squat 155 lbs without knee pain, so I'm not convinced that this video is not hard on the joints, even with proper form. I also practiced ballet for a while, which is notorious for screwing with knees, and I never once had knee pain. After one week of this DVD, I began experiencing soreness in both of my knees, so I thought I would give it a few days off. It's been almost three weeks, and my knees are still incredibly sore and stiff. They snap and pop, and I'm not sure when they will get better. I've been using proper form for 2 years on exercises, so I'm not sure every person who experiences knee pain after this DVD is to blame for improper form.    I think this video can provide good results, but I encourage those who want to try it to use caution.
B004RKXN44|4.0|This is the ninth novel in the Psy-Changeling series, one of the best out there. (There has also been at least one anthology novella).<br /><br />The lead romance was the long awaited Hawke and Sienna story. It was everything we've been waiting for, albeit a little drawn out. Not the book - I loved that we had a longer read from Singh than usual - but the actual romance. In fact, we had a second, concurrent story with another couple, I think precisely because she needed some forward movement from somebody. Hawke and Sienna had a tendency to perform the same no-yes-no scene over and over.<br /><br />We also entered a new, more direct era in the war with the Psy Council. (And for those who have already been following the series: I've been convinced for a couple of books now on who the Ghost is. How about you?)<br /><br />Bottom line, the characters are fabulous, the world they live in is amazing, and I was completely engrossed, as usual. Do yourself a favor, and read the entire series.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is a great, great album. You can feel the emotion and also be amazed at the technical abilities. Very little filler for such a long CD. I know Tool fans like other albums more, but this one is a perfect mix for me since I generally go to alternative music more than metal.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|In season one, \\"Fringe\\" was a good show with obvious potential for greatness.  In season two, the potential was realized.  And now in season three, it continues to advance to new levels, becoming one of the best drama series on television, and definitely my favourite on network television.  It was often said that \\"The X-Files\\" was better when it focused on standalone episodes instead of its myth arc, but \\"Fringe\\" is the exact opposite; its improvement has been deeply tied into the development of its complex and rich ongoing story.  Season Three picks up where Season Two left off, and does so superbly.  Spoilers follow.    Season Two ended with our Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) trapped in the alternate universe, with her counterpart (generally referred to by fans as Fauxlivia) taking her place on the Fringe team as a spy.  Olivia is at the mercy of Walternate, the alternate version of Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), who is out to prevent the destruction of his universe by destroying ours - though this was all prompted by the actions of our Walter in 1985.  To make matters more complicated, Fauxlivia finds herself in a relationship with Olivia's love interest Peter (Joshua Jackson), while Olivia is brainwashed to temporarily take Fauxlivia's place and enable the other side to gain the secret to how she travels interdimensionally.  And this is all just from the first two or three episodes, out of twenty-two.  There's a tremendous amount happening in \\"Fringe\\", perhaps more than in any other TV drama series.  By now, this is not a series that can be watched intermittently; it's a commitment (not that that would be an issue if you're buying the DVDs), a heavily-serialized story that plumbs the limts of the plausible and the depths of the human soul with equal skill.  The show effectively has two different worlds running now, each with their own storylines, which interlink in various ways (the \\"previouslies\\" for each episode valiantly attempt to provide the necessary information to hypothetical first-time viewers).    Consider, for instance, the challenges given to Anna Torv this season:  she plays not just Olivia, but also Fauxlivia, who, despite her fan nickname, is a fully realized character, both the same and different from Olivia; and there are a couple of additional variations thrown in over the course of the year for good measure (including a two-episode stint where she does an extended, amusing impression of Leonard Nimoy).  That the Emmys could overlook her work here speaks very poorly of them.  John Noble as Walter does not have quite the same revelatory year as he did last year, but he continues to provide both tragedy and comedy in good measure.  The biggest winner for this season is Joshua Jackson (who is, ironically, the only major castmember not called on to play an alternate version of himself).  If Peter often seemed a bit out of place when \\"Fringe\\" was mostly a procedural show, he has become absolutely central to its myth arc.  The rest of the cast does good work in supporting parts, occasionally getting their own moments (I'm a fan of a rare moment of comedy from Lance Reddick in episode 19).    Highly recommended; I can't wait to see what season four brings.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great album and the music is very good.  This artist has a lot of well deserved buzz.  I had only heard the one song that is on the radio but all the songs are very good.  Adele should have a long career if she keeps putting out music like this.  If I had one complaint, it is that she only put about 50 mins of music on the disc.  Not enough of a complaint to rate it less than 5 stars though.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\", along with \\"Mad Men\\", ushered in a revolution at the AMC network, which suddenly found itself with two of the most acclaimed drama series on television.  This third season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" continues this tradition of excellence, once again putting Walter White (Bryan Cranston, who collected his third Emmy for his work this year; though hopefully his absence from this year's Emmys will open doors for his network colleague Jon Hamm) and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul, who collected his first Emmy for this year) up to their necks in trouble.  Spoilers follow.    Season Two ended with Walter having beaten back cancer (for now) and achieved the money he needs to look after his family, at the cost of his family after his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn, superb, but perennially overlooked compared to her costars) discovered his lies and illegal activities.  Meanwhile, Jesse, who lost his girlfriend Jane to a tragic drug overdose, has gotten clean - unfortunately, while this leads to his realizing that he is the \\"bad guy\\", that only leads to him embracing criminality anew, with his eyes wide open.  Both men end up in business with Gus (Giancarlo Esposito), a methodical drug kingpin who conceals his dealings behind the front of a restaurant chain.  The fracturing of both Walt's family and his relationship with Jesse provides the dramatic impetus for the season as it advances.  Meanwhile, past sins come back to haunt Walt, and, despite Skyler's initial rejection of Walt, she finds herself increasingly drawn into the \\"family\\" business.    \\"Breaking Bad\\" is notable for its moral complexity, casting its protagonists as tremendously flawed individuals capable of great illegality and motivated by both supreme necessity and supreme egotism.  The two leads are superb and deserving of all their accolades, but the supporting cast is equally capable.  Dean Norris as Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law gets a considerable showcase for his talent this year.  Conversely, I'm always waitingfor the show to really do something with Walter Jr. (R. J. Mitte).  Esposito makes a superb addition to the cast as the ice-cold drug lord, and one hopes he will continue to be a presence in the show for some time to come (though based on where season three ends, that may not be possible).    Highly recommended.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I purchased this product expecting a life-size replica of the Tenth Doctor's screwdriver that lit up, made that sonic-y noise and had a sonic wave emitter that extended/retracted. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it not only met all of these expectations, but it also included a regular pen and an invisible ink pen. The bottom end of the screwdriver (the side opposite the light) is actually the pen tip, which pops off so you can switch between the invisible and regular ink tips. To reveal the invisible ink message, you just shine the screwdriver's UV light across it.    Included with the screwdriver are an instruction manual, the other pen tip that's not already connected, and one set of batteries (which you have to put in yourself).    Unfortunately, the quality of the screwdriver is not all that high, so don't expect a really fancy professional replica. It basically is a glorified children's toy.  Another tip: read the instruction manual. It was quite useful.    I gave this product a rating of 1 for its educational value because it offers no use for educational purposes whatsoever, unless you count being able to use it as a pen.    When I originally made this purchase, I expected a bit higher quality and durability, but I'm not too disappointed. The amount of use and fun I get out of my sonic screwdriver definitely makes up for my disappointment!
B001C4CI8U|4.0|From the mind of TV megaproducer-turned-film director J. J. Abrams (\\"Alias\\", \\"Lost\\", once upon a time known primarily as the creator of \\"Felicity\\", believe it or not) comes \\"Fringe\\", the latest in a long line of supernatural/science fiction procedural dramas (a number of which also aired on FOX).  \\"Fringe\\"'s most obvious antecedents are \\"The X-Files\\" (an FBI team investigating mysterious happenings) and Abrams' own \\"Alias\\" (starting with its lead female characer, and the comparisons become more obvious as the show goes on).  This first season on DVD does not pop right out of the gate like \\"Alias\\" did, but it is nonetheless a strong start and gets better the further along it goes.  Spoilers follow.    We open with Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv, the latest in a line of Abrams leading ladies), an FBI agent in Boston (bonus points for eschewing the standard New York/Los Angeles setting) who finds herself in the middle of a peculiar bioterrorism case when her partner/lover John Scott (Mark Valley, fairly consistently underused throughout his tenure on the show) is infected with a ghastly disease.  Olivia enlists the assistance of the eccentric Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble, in a series-stealing role), who has spent the last seventeen years in a mental institution.  Also along for the ride is Walter's estranged son Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Olivia's assistant Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), supervised by Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick).  The Fringe unit becomes a permanent unit investigating The Pattern, a chain of strange occurences that may all lead back to Massive Dynamic, the science conglomerate founded by Walter's old lab partner, Dr. William Bell, and run by Nina Sharp (Blair Brown).    \\"Fringe\\", like \\"The X-Files\\" and \\"Alias\\", mixes procedural and myth arc elements; there are individual cases, which may or may not be linked to the overarching story of The Pattern.  The procedural parts of the series, particularly in the early episodes, can be a little hit-and-miss.There's a fairly identifiable pattern to the early cases, much as with, say, \\"House\\", which after a while can feel a little repetitive.  However, the show is aided by some impressively gruesome effects, both makeup and CGI.  The series improves enormously the more it develops its larger plot and integrates it more fully into the individual cases, an indicator of the greatness to come in seasons two and three.  Anna Torv is a superb lead actress, with tremendously believable facial expressions.  She is matched by John Noble as Walter Bishop, who is simultaneously the main comic relief and the centre of the show's tragedy (though some of his early mannerisms can be a bit cutesy).  Joshua Jackson is suitably dashing as Peter, and has good chemistry with Torv, though at this juncture his character is still a little at a loss for a real role in the procedural aspects of the show.  The supporting cast is strong.    All in all, the show is off to a good start with season one.
1463514581|5.0|Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes is one of those books that I find myself rereading without meaning to. I open it and am PULLED back into the story immediately! Rose is such a quirky likable character and I find myself raving to friends about this mystery. Definitely belongs on every shelf!
0805086846|5.0|If any culture deserves reparations, it's the first nation people.  They were lied to at every turn, even as they were cordial and kind to their aggressors.  This book is very detailed  in the atrocities committed in the United States' quest for \\"Manifest Destiny\\".  I now know how the good german citizens felt after hearing of the acts their government committed during World War II.  Think about it:  single out a gentle people, put them in camps, starve them and deprive them of their dignity.  Sound familiar?
B0018RWMNM|1.0|I own about 75 BluRay discs. this is the worst in my collection by far. Any of the many night or dusk scenes are so grainy and poor, it's hard to watch. I don't mean a little grainy. ALOT grainy!! As a professional videographer, it look like those scenes were shot with an old 8mm video camera. It's hard to believe a company would even to bother with a BluRay at this quality. I'm very disappointed. I believe my old VHS tape looked better. Not worth the money. Buy a standard DVD.
0062060554|5.0|I could not put this book down! Before I Go to Sleep by S.J. Watson is a thrilling debut novel. Christine wakes up everyday not knowing who she is because of an accident that prevents her from retaining new memories. She is left to her husband Ben and her secret Dr. to help her piece it together. Her most important asset is her own journal. Can her own words be trusted?<br /><br />I loved that we kept learning things as Christine did. We were in the dark and guessing just as much as she is. Is she making things up? Is it all just a misunderstanding? Can she trust Ben? Can she trust the Dr? There a lot of twists and turns that kept me guessing. I kept rooting for Christine to find the truth about herself.<br /><br />The premise of the novel sucks you into the narrative and you will demand answers! What could simply have been a silly gimmick is bolstered by great characters and intrigue that does not end!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|By 2009, I had written Yes off as a sad caricature of itself, nothing but a tribute band that had not made a fantastic album in over 20 years.  In 1981 I had written Yes off as done.  In 1989 I believed the 8 member fratricide was the death knell of the band.  Then, I thought Union's terrible production and apparent apathy from the members sounded the death knell.  Each time I wrote the band off, it came back to life and surprised me.  I should have known better this time around.  Never, never write off Yes.  Never, never be surprised at where the journey will take them, along with their fans.  There appears to be more buzz about this album than anything the band has done since 1991's lackluster Union lp.  Sales on Amazon appear to be unbelievably high;  the forums and chat rooms are ablaze; even Rolling Stone had an interesting piece about the new project (who would have thunk that!)    When I review albums, I look for four qualities: 1) strong musical material (including lyrics); 2) strong musicianship; 3) strong production and sound engineering; and 4) a consistent, even flowing listen from beginning to end.  Fly From Here ticks all the right boxes.  Hence, I can easily give it a five star review.    The material is melodic, interesting, and bridges nicely within songs and between songs; it has a nice pop sensibility without being \\"poppish\\".  It has a nice prog sensibility without being \\"progissh\\".  It has drama, mystical elements, emotional highs, color and, it is just a downright FUN listen.      The musicianship is stellar (although White is a bit subdued, not the power beast he was in the 70s and 80s).  Howe's and Squire's performance put a smile on my face.  I love Downes keyboard work.  And, I enjoy David's voice... it is not a Jon copy, nor a Horn copy, although, to my ear, it has elements closer to Horn than Anderson.      What can I say about the production??  In short, it is outstanding!  Horn is a dynamo in the studio.  The best Yes albums were produced by Eddy Offord and Trevor Horn.  These two producers understand the band better than, I believe, band members understand each other, and Yes as a whole.  Thus, this is easily the best produced album since the early Rabin Yes years.    The listen is a pleasure from beginning through middle, to the final note.  No fillers, no material or questionable production to worry about.  The first few bars of Squire's \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\" had me a bit worried; and, I believe, under any other producer, would have come off as a dud.  But a full listen eased my concerns.  It is catchy, poppy, and well crafted without being drippy or sappy.    I can't understand why the \\"no Jon, no Yes\\" crowd cannot just enjoy the band for what it is now!  And now, the band is better on vinyl (so to speak) than it has been in more than 20 years.  I must admit, I miss hearing Jon's voice in the mix, and yet I do not miss it.  This album could have never been crafted with Jon in the ranks.  Drama could never have been crafted with Jon in the ranks.  I am mighty thankful for Drama and Fly From Here; the Yes catalogue would not be complete without these two stellar albums.    How does Fly From Here stand against the Yes albums all Yes fans can agree are the very best (The Yes Album, Fragile, Close to the Edge)?  Only time will tell.  Fly From Here is a very different album from those early works.  The current band is very different, in membership, in age, in life.  And I am happy with this... for life goes on.  Yes does not have to make or match another Fragile (my favorite Yes work) to satisfy me.  However, the band does need to offer more than it did on Union, Keys, Open Your Eyes, and Magnification (my least favorite Yes works).  Fly From Here is head and shoulders above those mediocre efforts.  Once again, I have learned the lesson to never write this band off.  Just when you think they are goners, they will surprise you!
0439023521|4.0|If only half stars were real...I wanted to give this book 4.5 stars. It was an exciting read and kept me reading way past what should have been my bed time. It's an excellent and unbelievably gripping book!    However, some of the elements felt to contrived, and for that, I could not give an otherwise enthralling book five stars
B00005JKGO|5.0|I still recall my first couple viewings of La Dolce Vita. I was always unsure exactly what I thought of this peek into the lives of the rich and beautiful... and why anyone would want to make a movie about it (at the time this film was produced). But Fellini was all about examining life, and he didn't consider class in the process.     When I finally bought \\"Vita\\", in an effort to put together a decent collection of Italian films, I watched it as an examination of life... nothing more or less. Watching in the manner in which Fellini went on record to explain what motivated him to produce films helped. I actually laugh at scenes I had little reaction to before, and I find myself nodding or shaking my head --knowingly-- at others.    More than a film about the rich and beautiful, this is a film about the things with which we want to and/or fill our lives. Because the film has no clear narrative (and life doesn't pass with carefully planned narrative), the audience is bombarded with the unquenchable \\"want/desire\\" of the protagonist and his crowd. Every once in while we're reminded of the way the other half lives, and what they deem important. With each \\"reminder\\", I find \\"The Sweet/Good Life\\" makes my skin crawl just a little more. And I consider how so much of modern society is more like the haves than the have nots.    If you aren't familiar with this cinematic gem, there has been a lot of debate regarding religious under/overtones and numerology in the film. Those debates don't interest me much.    Finally, the digital transfer of \\"Dolce\\" is gorgeous. I've read about the version with the subtitles on the actual picture. The version I have doesn't suffer from any of that. I'm looking forward to future viewings/examinations AND the revelations about my life I'll realize through them.
0439023513|3.0|Hey Katniss, would you like some cheese with that whine?    A whining main character who was once strong, a slow story line to a once addictive premise, and an anti-climatic, maudlin ending to series whose ending should have left the reader dizzy with excitement contributed to this disappointment laden book.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I don't want to spoil anything so I won't lol.<br />I've been with the Potter series since someone (I can't remember who) told me to watch \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\". I loved it.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I've got a manuscript and an editor, but still I was not sure about how to launch my book. Two facts happened in the last days: I received a bad evaluation of my text from the editor and I bought Locke's 'How I sold 1 million ebooks in 5 months'. This was enough. My manuscript is good (I say it!). And John has convinced me of kindle self-publication. I'll go for it!  I've appreciated the effective, direct way of presenting the methodology for promoting and selling ebooks.   For young or senior writers, I recommend Locke's 'manual'.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|It great to have these DVD's on hand!! I watch them everyday. I am an NCIS junkie and can watch the same shows over and over! Dealing with Amazon is great. I have been thoroughly satisfied with everything I have purchased.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love this movie!  It has all the elements of a great movie - great script, great acting, and great directing.  Making an historical figure come alive and interesting is not an easy undertaking and I'm sure the history was tweaked a little to make this movie.  As the second son of the King, George was NOT supposed to be the successor - his older brother Edward was.  But Edward chose his love of a twice-divorced American mistress over the throne and George was thrown into the spotlight - stutter and all.  To see such a great man and know that he suffered from speech impediment, brings him to the level of an ordinary person.  Women can relate to his wife Queen Elizabeth, who patiently tried to help her husband overcome his fear of public speaking.  As I said to my own darling husband, behind every great man, there's even GREATER woman!<br /><br />My only disappointment with this DVD was that it did not have much info on the REAL Lionel Logue, the king's Australian speech therapist, only the notes from Logue's notebooks.  As much as I admire Colin Firth's portrayal of the King (and he did an AMAZING job!), I think Geoffrey Rush stole the movie.  Wonderful film!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|i really love this series i randomly found it on netflicks and the first episode grabbed me in. to be honest i am not usually huge on these types of shows. the characters were awesome and each had there own quirk about them. i like the sexuality in the series its interesting. i watched this sereis before i ever even heard of dr. who. tried watching dr.who and could not get into it to be fair i started with the originals. will buy this series.
B004K4IZ3G|1.0|EVERY time I have purchased a Disney Bluray I have had issues with the firmware on my player. I can and have purchased Blurays from other studios and VERY rarely had a problem. Disney every damn time! Enough. I will no longer purchase Disney Bluray product. A shame as I like many of thier films.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I'll break down my review into the following sections:  1. Initial thoughts on movie  2. Video, Audio Quality  3. Special Features    1. I initially heard a ton of bad reviews about this movie; most people were disappointed with the execution considering all the hype. I never saw the movie in a  theater, but rather rented it on blu-ray and then decided to buy it, especially when I found out that the Two-Disc Extended Edition had an R-rated version of the film that had an additional ~20 minutes. I also wanted to see the extra features. As far as the film goes, it's a got a pretty simple story that is easy to follow, a linear plot (for the most part), and plenty of visually impressive effects, typical of Zack Snyder. The few complaints that I have about the film itself is that the characters are not very well developed (which is improved slightly in the extended version), and some of the more visually impressive scenes are not well integrated into the story and seem more like they were incorporated as a means of showing off the capabilities of CG. 7/10 in this aspect.    2. In regards to the actual video and audio quality, the blu-ray transfer was excellent and the video quality, even for blu-ray is pretty incredible. I cannot imagine watching this film is anything less than full 1080p high-resolution. The audio is synced well and complements the stunning visual effects well throughout the film. Multiple coding options are available on the disc, so it can be optimized for any home theater setup. 9/10 here.    3. The special features, while not incredibly extensive, make a huge difference when choosing to rent or buy this film. The extended version does not dramatically change the quality of the film, but does provide a little more time for character development without interrupting the flow of the narrative. A relatively unique feature is \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" which is also found on Watchmen and is basically a visual commentary by Director Zack Snyder. If you are intothe film-making process, this alone makes this product worth buying. There are a lot of photo galleries and stills that I don't find very interesting, but overall the special features are top notch. 7/10 for these.
1451629184|5.0|Reading Jaycee's book makes me so grateful for kids who are around to complain about how I don't allow them as many freedoms as they would like. I will never let them leave the house without a kiss and a be careful. All and only good things to you, Jaycee, for your future and that of your family.
B004XISI4A|2.0|I my opinion the story has lost its focus.<br />1)Too many descriptions of: food, stangers, sailing ships, landscapes. Thanks to these desercriptions there are more pages in the book. There is no substance in it.<br />2)It's realy hard to belive that weak Daenerys is the same person who was born in fire with her dragons. She is spending her time on thinking: I'm a monster and very bad queen or I want him badly.<br />If she ever go to Westeros all Westerosi should pray all gods to save them.<br />3)Not satisfying story development.<br />4)What is the purpose of killing next well known POV and introducing new one?<br />5)Clifhangers created to make readers buy next book.<br /><br />Perheps I'm not a prophet but I have very strong feeling that ASOIAF series will end with new POV characters: sir Nobody of Nowhere who will wed and bed Lady Another Nobody after winning old game of throne in Westeros but before that they eat many many many times and drink many many times. For such noble people is expected they will be wearing many many items of clothitng. Each of these doings will be discribed very precisly.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Nothing really new or amazing here.  An alien escaped a train car and some kids found out about it.  Now they try to uncover the mystery behind the disappearances of local townspeople.<br /><br />I felt like I was treading heavily through some of the cheesy, emotional plot.  I was entertained; however, and eager to learn more about the alien.
B001E75QGG|3.0|I had heard a lot more bad than good before I sat down to watch this movie, but still I knew that the series had never disappointed me before so I was hopeful. My first impression was dang, this blu ray looks very nice! From there we see a quite a bit older Indiana Jones, familiar faces, and familiar action. I completely understand all the criticism I have read about the movie. In the end though, I'm not that offended by many of the things that people are really upset over.     Some spoilers below...     For instance the atomic test scene...sure, getting flung 100 meters in a fridge would probably kill just about every normal person, but come on were talking about Indian Jones here! Next, the villain...I agree they could have found a better adversary for Indy, but overall it worked and actually created a few tense moments as she used Indy as her pawn. One of the glaring problems I saw in the movie was the jungle amphibious vehicle chase scene. Not only did it drag on a little long, bit at one point we see Shia LaBeouf's character swinging from the trees with an entire group of monkeys. Hmm, I couldn't really force my brain to believe that mess. I had an easier time buying that Indy's whole team of sidekicks survives the three waterfalls over that. The next issue many people seem to have is the family dynamic that's occurring between Indy, Mutt, and Marion. Yes, there are several times where this back and forth dialogue nearly brings the film to a screeching halt, but it's not a show stopper by any means. Last but not least there's the issue with the aliens...err um, I mean the interdivisional beings. I thought that the idea was really building steam until the last 10 minutes of the movie where we see it fall flat. I think the idea of the beings and the way it was carried out in the story was almost flawless until the end, but the problem is that it went so bad in the end that it makes it seem that it was all for nothing. What really happened in the end? Well, I guess that's for each viewer to decide.    In the end we see that Indy is going to most likely settle down into his new life and for a split second we see his son pick up his hat as the wind blows it to his feet. I thought to myself \\"Hell no! Don't you dare put that hat on and then we will be stuck with LeBouf as the new Indy!!!\\"  Luckily at the last second Indy snatches it out of his hands and puts it back on. Whew, close one!    Overall Lucas and Spielberg didn't do too badly here. The cast is pretty deep and the story is classic Indian Jones with its share of action, intrigue, and wit. The biggest problem comes from the part of the title that's called \\"Indiana Jones.\\" When people saw that they immediately got their hopes way too high. 3.5 stars.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Every screen change (options, etc.) generates a force close on HTC Thunderbolt.  It might be a good game, but I can't tell.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|Ratey has concocted an in-depth read that will challenge the beginners mind to call upon the glossary to recognize the Latin and Greek used by physicians in the medical world.  As a college alumni and continuing student in pre-med (neurology) and a personal trainer working to establish his own training studio, I find this very enlightening and informative-about the meticulous and biological functionality of the brain.  I do not want to bore you with a three paragraph review: In short, if you are familiar with some of the general anatomy of the brain, and the physiology of the the psychosomatic relationship-you may obtain much information from this book to affirm what you may already know; furthermore, you may facilitate a deeper understanding of the mind body relationship.  For beginners, this could be completely transformational to your life in whichever ways it applies to you.  Ratey definitely drives home the point about the importance of exercise and its efficacious stimulus on the brain and body, some parts you may even find mildly funny.  On the downside, I found parts of the book to be moderately redundant in the points being made, personally, I see the importance in doing so, but it may bore some readers to not complete the read.      Conclusively, it was a great read, and I have quoted from it many of times.  I would recommend this book to anyone with the ability to retain their attention in reading, there are many jewels of valuable information buried throughout the read; kudos to John Ratey.
B0036TGSIK|2.0|I heard mostly good things about Easy A, but after viewing, I am a bit astonished by the many favorable reviews, especially considering how relatively commonplace this comedy is. Easy A tells the story of one high school girl who uses a rumor of having sex to boost her popularity. She finds that things quickly get out of hand, and she tries to protect her image, keep her friendship, and more importantly try to find out who she is amidst all the high school mayhem and gossip.  The film attempts to be satirical in some ways and genuine in others, but there are missed opportunities to make it a funny, unique movie. Instead, there is a run of the mill approach to direction, characterization and plot, and it suffers from being rather false .     Easy A is surprisingly mediocre, its presentation phony and superficial, using caricatures rather than characters to sell its plot, with its story and lesson being somewhat petty.  Indicative of Hollywood high school land, we have prototype antagonists, cardboard to the max, whose sole purpose is to fling degrading insults at the protagonist. The film further shows its immature approach by using Christians as the major antagonists as a parallel to Hawthorne's hypocritical Puritans (in The Scarlet Letter). (Apparently Christians are fair game as being portrayed as disingenuous in Hollywood...Where are the Hollywood PC police when you really need them?) Olive's parents are ridiculously unbelievable, quite annoying, having apparently been transplanted directly from the set of Juno to Easy A, as their super duper hip, cool demeanor towards anything and everything Olive has to throw at them doesn't faze them a bit. (That scene with Olive and her mom talking and her mom describing her sexual exploits...ummm..yeah, right, like THAT would ever happen). Meanwhile, Olive's friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) is the biggest nitwit of them all, and I'm still trying to figure out how they were \\"friends\\" in the first place. Not only was their friendship shallow and insincere, but it was pretty much unnecessary to the movie's plot other than bringing in some contrived conflict. And, as a whole, the movie pretty much reeked of phoniness trying to embody some serious life lesson, but really comes across hallow to the core. Easy A sells itself as some modern rehashing of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, but it is a very flimsy, superficial one at that. It's too bad, because Easy A could have been a clever satire.     The one saving grace of Easy A is Emma Stone. While I liked Emma Stone's performance, I didn't think the script (or its lack of originality) did her any justice, or gave her much to work with. Her character Olive, however, does have some depth (unlike virtually every other character), but everything about the whole fake sex thing seemed so dumb and contrived. (Are all the students, counselors, teachers and principle at this school that gullible, dense, and dim-witted? I guess so.)  Still, I liked her better in The Rocker and Zombieland, where her sarcastic, witty demeanor and acting ability shines, and she does not have to carry a film.     Easy A is pretty the stuff of your standard Hollywood tripe. Any references to John Hughes'80s films should be left at the door.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|One of my best blu ray disc purchase and one of the few movies that impressed my un-impressionable wife:)  Two thumbs up...
B00004Y6NU|4.0|While the song Industrial Disease was the album rock hit from Love Over Gold, Telegraph Road is an epic masterpiece that grabs your heart and holds on. It is one of those songs that nearly everyone can relate to. Mark Knopfler's wonderful lyrics and haunting guitar will keep you coming back for more. Highly recommended.....and worst of all young man, you've got Industrial Disease!
1451629184|5.0|I dont think I have ever read a book so fast as I did with this one.  After seeing the Diane Sawyer interview, I purchased the book immediately, and was finished in about 5 hours - I could not put it down!  This is one beautiful, nurturing and courageous girl who endured a horrific past that very few people will ever endure, let alone tell about it. In her story, I can truly understand how she couldn't have left, I know that was the question in everyone's mind when they first found her, but she was 11 years old!!!!  She was manipulated and scared and did what she had to do; but it does make you wonder what to tell your own children if they are ever in that situation.  Do you tell them to run? If Jaycee tried to run and didn't succeed would they have punished her worse (if you can get any worse), or even killed her?  There is no answer to this question besides doing what you have to do to keep yourself alive and that is what she did and I applaud her for that.        I truly wish nothing but the best for Jaycee and her family and hope that in the years to come she endures nothing but wonderful times in her newfound life.      Excellent book Jaycee!
B00006I53S|2.0|While this lens takes pretty good pictures, I can't endorse it's purchase.  When I received the lens, it looked like it was in good condition so I installed it on my camera.  I quickly realized that autofocus was not working properly.  After testing different shots and different conditions, the autofocus would only move every so often, and the camera would not take pictures because the AF wasn't working.  When AF DID work, it was very slow and sluggish.  After awhile, it wouldn't work at all.  I brought it to a local camera store, and they diagnosed it as a bad motor (all other lenses work on my camera, so it was not the camera).    The lens worked fine with manual focus and I don't have any complaints about the picture quality.      I'm not sure if the bad lens motor was due to Canon's QC or if was due to the infamous subpar packaging of lenses from Amazon.  Either way, the lens was defective and was sent back.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Turned out way better than I expected.  I have read it several times, and would love to hear more about the characters.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|At first, I always wanted a wireless surround sound system for my room. As I began searching, I found that the options were pretty limited, and the costs were very high. I knew I could never put in a wired system, since I do not have the knowledge and my parents would probably kill me. Then I remembered my cousin had Turtle Beaches for his Xbox 360. When I began to search I realized this was the best solution for me, since it provided the surround sound system effect. Upon researching for about a week and asking lots of people's opinion I kept on getting pointed to the X41. After a day or two of thinking, I made the leap and purchased the X41 as opposed to the X31.<br /><br />Out of the box, the headphones appear rather cheap. They are made mostly of plastic and so I do not know how long they will last. The headphones come with a receiver, which connects to a digital output on the Xbox 360 and also has a USB connector which connects to the 360 as well (this is actually where the receiver gets its power supply from). From the directions, it appears they do not have information on the Xbox 360 Slim which I have. There is no input for the Xbox 360 Slim on the other end of the RCA cables. Instead, you will find one near the cable which connects into your power supply. After that, setup was pretty much a breeze. The manual warns that interference can occur with a Wireless N network (which I have) however, I do not have that problem.<br /><br />For Gaming:<br />After finally getting everything going, I decided to play the most recent Grand Theft Auto. At first, I played it for about 5 minutes with no headphones, and then I put them on. The change was like night and day. You can hear peoples footsteps getting closer and closer from the distance. You know a car is about to pass you because you could hear it turn down the street from behind you. There is a helicopter coming from the right and quickly flying over to your left. Someone nearby gets into a car accident and you can hear the awful crush of metal. It was just amazing. Then I decided to pull out some guns...which is a bad idea when the volume is maxed. It was LOUD and intense, especially with guns such as the AK47, but it was awesome. I decided to then take out a rocket launcher and hit a nearby car. The explosion was ridiculous and the ringing was intense. I would also recommend getting really nice cars and driving them fast, since the roar of the engine makes you feel like your there. I then switched to many other games, such as Call of duty, which was also great since you could hear where people were coming from while playing online. Overall, a great experience.<br /><br />For Music:<br />Then I thought, wouldn't it be nice to hook this up to my iPod? Unfortunately, this is not completely possible. First off, the jacks for the headphones are mini-jacks, so they do not fit headphone jacks. I knew there are mini-jack to headphone jack cables, so I did alittle research online and then found that they will not work. The headphones must be operating with the receiver and cannot be used independently. So you will not be able to just listen to your music on these headphones outside of the room the receiver is in. What you will need is a cable with the white and red RCA males and then a headphone jack connection on the other end. Plug the RCA's into the receiver and the other end into your iPod or whatever, and bingo. The receiver will then wirelessly send music to your X41. The quality here is pretty good. However, I have had Bose headphones which cost about the same as this headset and the Bose are much better. These headphones just don't offer the same amount of bass (even with the bass booster, which is still a very nice feature). But don't get me wrong, the sound quality is very good and is probably better than any other earbuds that you have. I just think that this headset wasn't exactly made for this purpose to begin with.<br /><br />For Movies:<br />After I was thinking about music, I then drifted into the thought of movies. I know that the majority of movies now are in Dolby digital surround sound, so these headphones would be perfect for it. I own a relatively new 1080i Vizio Razor which unforunately has about the worse speakers known to man. Anyway, I also have a laptop with a built in Blu-ray player and HDMI input. So typically, I just connect my laptop using HDMI into my TV and use my laptop as basically a Blu-ray player. This works very well actually, and the quality is amazing. Then I connected the digital cable from the receiver of the X41 directly to a digital port in my TV. I learned that this actually allows me to listen to movies in full Dolby surround sound and I can also listen to any TV channel (even when the TV is set to mute, since the audio is independent - which is awesome). So then I popped in a Blu-ray Harry Potter to my laptop and was off. All I can say is, WOW. I think these were made more for movies than for the Xbox. I could hear EVERYTHING from all different angles. Up-left, up-right, up-middle, left, right, behind, left-behind, right-behind, so on and so on. When something intense happens you nearly scare yourself half to death. I'm sure these would be really good for a scary movie. Very very impressed with this setup.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Overall, these are great headphones which provide high quality audio at a price you can live with. The only wish(s) I would have is possibly an equalizer and saving audio presets (much like the PX5). Also, maybe upping the max volume would be nice as well, cause I mean, it can never be too loud can it? In addition, higher bass is really needed, though I understand it is not that important for gaming..but at such a high price tag you really need to find every use for these things. I also worry about its durability, but since I have only had these for about a week I can not say anything about that yet..so far, so good.t of movies.

0439023521|5.0|i love the hunger games now, im obsessed! it was a very stressful book. i thought the end was sad ' ''one more time for the audience?'' asks peeta. i grip his hand dreading the moment i will have to let go.\\"' Katniss is a very independant character peeta is not. the whole cross-starred lovers thing made me sad when he found out she was lying part-time im sure she was un-sure about her feelings the whole time...just not the ending. i am still waiting for when i can get the next book. i am waiting for more bouncing up and down waiting for the next one. it made me nearly want to cry when i read that he got a mechanical leg im exited for the movie. i dont want there to be an ending. for everyone who has already read the first book it is amazing,yes and i think suzanne collins is writting a book about the daughter cause it said they will be casting a part for the son and daughter in the third movie. if you are not sure if you should read this i would HIGHLY suggest it.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|1986, What a year for metal. Arguably at it's peak at the time in the music industry, many of thrash's best bands were releasing their best/now classic albums. Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood, Pleasure to Kill, Darkness Descends, and of course Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Well, as time would tell you, alot of people did buy it, and rightfully forseeing Megadeth as one of the top metal bands in the world. This is the album that did it for me, for the longest time not really being able to get into Megadeth's music, no matter how hard friends or myself tried, nothing would stick. But one day, getting this album and listening to the first 30 seconds of Wake Up Dead, as Lars points out in the liner notes, it woke me up to the amazing, sheer brutal-vinegar'n'piss of Megadeth. From there, I was hooked, and still am to this very day. Something that makes an album great is the vibe it creates each time you listen to it, only the best of the best of albums can do this and Peace Sells is one of them. Everytime I listen to it, no matter what I can feel it, and that's just how powerful this record is. When Dave Remixed the Megadeth back catalog back in 2004, this album in particular lost that 'vibe' due to the remixing. Yes, technically speaking perhaps it is sonically better sounding for the instruments, but that's not what Megadeth is about. It's about making a statement, attitude, aggression, pissed, and everything that is pure in metal. This package brings back the fantastic original mixed album, remastered gloriously despite what anyone says, the tape hiss has been removed, leaving crystal clarity between songs. The acoustic stringed parts never sounded better, as with Junior's bass. Everything sounds like it should and it kills! The live show is great for the old-school fan, if your in it for quality performance, not just sound. And it sounds pretty nice for a 1987 bootleg recording! So if you're wondering if it's worth possibly buying this classic album for a 3rd time, well can you put a price on classic!?e, well can you put a price on classic!?
0553801473|3.0|Without spoiling the book...<br /><br />6 years is a long time to wait and I can respect that GRRM had difficulty figuring out where to take the story.  Thus, I think it would be almost impossible to meet my expectations for the book.  The first three in the series were spectacular, the last two books, not so much.  One major surprise in the book has vague support from earlier books, but still seemed a bit out of left field.  A few other major developments are interesting but not shocking or terribly exciting.  My general sense is that we have to much narrative that just fails to develop the primary characters and the inclusion of new secondary characters that just seems pointless.  I hope book 6 starts to bring this thing together and I pray that it won't take another 6 years.

0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion<br /><br />By Richard Dawkins<br /><br />Book Review<br /><br />By Richard E. Noble<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is British. He is a scientist and an avid supporter of Darwin and the concept of Natural Selection. He is a professor at Oxford University. He is also an atheist - or as close as one can get to an atheist by his own definition. He offers no support for \\"faith\\" or religion. The Bible and the God of the Old Testament are not two of his favorite things. In case there is any doubt about where Mr. Dawkins stands on those issues let me quote a snippet from page 31 of this text:<br /><br />\\"The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty, ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously, malevolent bully.\\"<br /><br />I should think that quote by itself should absolve the author from any returns made by purchasers claiming that they bought this book by mistake. They thought that the author was a Christian Theologist and now they would like their money back.<br /><br />He defines \\"faith\\" as belief beyond reason. And he further states that this is not a good thing. To encourage others to believe in what is not reasonable, or beyond logic and scientific reasoning, is the source of most of the world's problems and has been for centuries. He feels it should be discouraged.<br /><br />He is not a supporter of organized religions. He supports those who feel that teaching religion to children is a form of child abuse. He feels that educating children into religions should be stopped. Everyone notices the outrage of this practice when viewing the practice among religions not of their choice but find the whole process legitimate with their own children and their religious choice.<br />I would say that this book is basically an argument against belief in God or a God and the dangers of organized religion. The author deals with this controversial subject intellectually and reasonably. His views are very strong but he supports them with logical arguments and science.<br /><br />He dismisses the proofs for the existence of God by St. Thomas Aquinas in as quick and a simple a fashion as I have ever read. He covers many of the basic philosophical arguments in a simple and direct language. For a more in depth analysis of this subject I would recommend \\"The Impossibility of God\\" [[ASIN:1591021200 The Impossibility of God]] edited by Michael Martin and Rici Monnier.<br /><br />The author says that he is attempting to open people's awareness and especially their awareness of the ramifications of Darwin's principle of Natural Selection.<br />He has got my curiosity. I am interested in his explanations and I am certainly not as aware as he would like me to be.<br /><br />For example: At one point in the book he argues with those who contend that the Universe and Life could not have been a matter of chance. The author agrees but contends that the argument is not between chance and design by a supernatural creator but between chance and Natural Selection.<br /><br />I'm of the opinion that chance is fine. It is the only reasonable alternative and an acceptable answer. To posit God as an answer to the complicated origin of life and the Universe when there is no evidence of the existence of such a phenomenon is the same as saying Santa Clause did it or it was the Fairy Queen who is responsible for life and the Universe. It is a non-sequitur.<br /><br />I can understand the author's position in choosing Natural Selection as the origin of life but I do not see how Natural Selection answers the question of the origin of the Universe. Natural Selection is also subject to the infinite regression argument as is God.<br /><br />To say that the Universe always was and always will be in one shape or form or another is fine with me. I see no other rational alternative at this time. To say that it \\"came about\\" via a process of \\"Natural Selection,\\" I find confusing. Clearly I need to be made more aware. I have another of the author's books on my reading shelf \\"The Extended Phenotype.\\" [[ASIN:0198576099 The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection]]  I will read that and see if I can become more aware.<br /><br />This book, The God Delusion, is simple, easy to read and covers the basics of apostasy as I see it. The author pulls no punches and presents his view confidently and unabashed.<br /><br />I commend the author, Richard Dawkins, for speaking out as forcefully as he does. Theologists and the modern crowd of evangelicals are not the least bit timid in making their superstitions public. I see no reason why those of a contrary and more rational opinion should not do likewise.<br /><br />Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />\\"Mein Kampf - Analysis of Book One - History.ind confusing.

0007250916|5.0|Cancer is one of America's most feared illnesses. It attacks suddenly and indiscriminately, and many of the treatments for it are just as deadly as the affliction itself. Mukherjee covers both the social and medical history of this subject. Up until the latter half of the twentieth century, cancer survival was seen as a battle to be fought in private. During the 1950s, as the author informs us, the very word \\"cancer\\" was considered too indecent to appear in print. A cancer physician himself, Mukherjee examines the illness not so much from a clinical perspective, but from a \\"human\\" one. How long has it been around? More importantly, how can it be cured? These are only a few of the questions that the author tackles in language that is both informative and easy to understand.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|the library has not received this yet but I enjoyed in on TV.    I wish they would come from Amazon to the library faster ahead of the market place so we (the library) would have them first.  I also would like to say the guy turned ugly seems to look like more of the tats the kids are getting so not sure he would be viewed as ugly by all. :)
B002NPCUVM|4.0|Reed and Irving deliver a clear, straightforward adaptation of Shelley's classic novel that older children will be able to both enjoy and understand. Soft, surreal, black and white illustrations set the stage for this gripping, elegant narrative. Facial expressions are never dull, and at times border on the melodramatic. The centerpiece of this work is the Monster himself - towering and lanky with long, disproportional limbs, this creature is dark and frightening, yet expressive and laden with undeniable human thoughts and emotions. Part of the Puffin Classic Graphics series, this graphic adaptation is one that can certainly stand apart from the original. Recommended for Ages 11-15.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I read the first book and LOVED it. This one I kinda felt like something was missing. I still strongly think it's worth reading. I'm hoping the third book will be better. Can't wait! ;)
037571457X|5.0|This graphic memoir documents the Iranian childhood of Marjane Satrapi, the only child of Marxist parents. Beginning with the Islamic revolution of 1979, the author uses black and white drawings in a simple comic-strip format to invoke Iran's tumultuous history, from prehistory days, to the eventual overthrow of the Shah and the triumph of the restrictive Islamic regime. At the heart of this memoir, however, is Marjane's beloved family. Her supportive parents, grandmother, and relatives are as endearing as the spirited, outspoken young girl who narrates their family's story. Persepolis came to the silver screen in 2007, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. Recommended for ages 16-Up for language and violence.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I didn't think much about this book when I chose it to read on my summer reading list. But about a quarter into it I LOVED IT! I've read the Hunger Games and many other top teen picks and this is just as good as any! I don't get whats up with all the negative reviews? If you like action, adventure, and some fantasy I strongly recommend this book. I'm a teen girl and I loved this book. I've already started reading the sequel.
B004KABHEY|4.0|US Marshal Teddy Daniels is sent to Shutter Island, home to the Ashecliff Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to investigate the possible escape of Rachel Solando, a patient who was committed for drowning her three children. None of the hospital staff seem very eager to help, and each clue brings more questions than answers to this baffling case. Who can Teddy trust? Is Ashecliff Hospital what it seems? Teddy is a sympathetic and complex tragic hero, one whom readers will root for until the very last page. While Shutter Island proves to be an engrossing psychological thriller, it unfortunately does not add anything new to the genre. The story's \\"twist\\" is one that has become so formulaic, some readers may figure out the truth long before the big reveal at the end.
B0055D3EOG|3.0|This is the type of movie that makes me wonder if movie producers sit around a table and say \\"it should be scary, but not too scary, or it won't appeal to a wide audience...\\" I wonder what the result would be if someone actually tried to make a movie that was really terrifying. In my opinion, the scariest movies let you invent the bad guy in your own mind, based upon the little hints and things that the movie shows you. If you reveal the bad guy and he looks like a dude wearing a lot of makeup and a costume, it takes all of the suspense away. And it makes the audience members feel like a bunch of ninnies for being so unnerved to begin with. I liked what another reviewer said about the demon looking like Darth Mal from Star Wars. I agree- except Darth Mal was much scarier.    I am a big fan (and critic) of horror movies. This one was edgy and intriguing in the beginning, and I agree with a lot of others in that the whole thing took a downward turn around 3/4 of the way through. Its funny, you watch enough movies and you start to be able to pinpoint the exact moment when the script or the action loses you. I guess the acceptable level of ridiculousness is different for everyone, but this one presses the boundaries of even the most accepting audiences.    Overall, I liked it, despite my complaints. A girl can like something even though she thinks its silly, right? (there are so many jokes that could potentially be inserted here that I have opted out altogether). The ending didn't completely ruin the whole thing, but I walked away from it giggling instead of being slightly creeped out.
0743454537|4.0|In a family struggling with the grueling demands of caring for a chronically sick child, 13-year-old Anna's life has never truly been her own. Conceived for the sole purpose of providing a bone marrow transplant for her sister Kate, who diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia at the age of 2, Anna has been providing her with tissue samples from birth. When Anna learns of the potential long-term effects of the kidney transplant she is expected to provide, she at last decides to claim her life, and her body, for her own. Picoult deals with a controversial topic with surprising grace and scope that covers not just Anna's story, but represents each member of the family. This slow-moving potboiler is not without some flaws. It suffers from the teeth-grating aggravation of unnecessary subplots and backstory (these can be skipped without the reader missing much), as well as a rather annoying surprise ending. But the ending is what it is. You'll either like it or you won't. The verdict? Minor flaws in an otherwise satisfying page-turner.
B004EPYZP8|1.0|This left me feeling that this was film-made-by-committee: In some cases the plot has twists and gimmicks that were both intelligent and demonstrative of some of the slight-of-hand that goes on within and without the justice system. That was from the book. Unfortunately, the rest of the writing is like a juvenile living in mom's basement. Matthew McCanoughy is very good as the slick, unconventional attorney, but when you have him approaching a holding cell to talk to someone who's just been arrested surrounded by other prisoners you know the screenwriting is done by someone who's never been near a jail in his life. Similar embarrassing demonstrations of ignorance mar any drama that the courtroom scenes could have/should have had. Absurd give and take from the witness stand and complete lack of understanding concerning what a lawyer would have objected to mingle what is actually a pretty good plot twist. Stereotypical cops, etc. snarl at defence lawyers and ex-wife Asst DAs trample crime scenes at will, as you imagine a teenager directing this nonsense for a high-school film class. Like a boxing movie made by someone who's never been to a boxing-match.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|My husband and I have watched every Harry Potter movie in the theater; I however, am the only one who has read the entire series.  We have differing opinions when it came to the films.  From a movie standpoint all the films were really good.  Yes the young actors weren't as seamless with their characters as the more mature ones were, but the magic of the movies allowed one to look past that.  What always bothered me was the disconnect between the book and the movie. I remember complaining to my husband and he said `I am so glad I never read the books because I adore the movies.' Hmpf.  What I also noticed was as the movies took longer to come out, more time had lapsed between reading and watching.  This made the movies that much better.  I can say that this last Harry Potter was excellent. I read the Deathly Hollows the day it came out, and haven't picked up a Harry Potter since.  We watched Part I yesterday then followed it up with Part II...<br /><br />This was a strong ending for the series, which really, is the best thing the directing/movie makers could have done. At the end you are left wanting more, but left satisfied that it closed so powerfully.  You can tell how much the actors have matured, both in their acting and ability to fully immerse themselves in the characters. I didn't see it in 3D (sometimes makes me sick) but I loved the special effects.  Like the book it is sad.... Really sad and there were people openly crying in the theater. The music (as with every Potter film before) was phenomenal, really added to the creepiness/sadness/joy of the different scenes.<br /><br />I highly recommend seeing this in theaters. We might go back next weekend just to see the difference in 3D. Enjoy!

B004UUKDNA|4.0|This is a good solid album with some great catchy tunes. Pumped up Kicks is a fantastic song which attracted me to this band. I'm in my 40s so bands like this generally aren't my scene but these guys stand out from the average pack of wannabes. I'm a lyrics man and I really like what the song writer has to say, put together with catchy hooks and awesome rhythm makes for a extremely enjoyable experience which I highly recommend. It's not Nirvana Nevermind but it stands up with its own individual appeal. Highlights for me Helena Beat, Warrant and Pumped up Kicks - enjoy.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This is a good book and an enjoyable read.  If you enjoyed the first three and could at least tolerate number 4, I am heartily recommending it!  Obviously,as many have said--it could have been more satisfying.  I just re-read the series after watching the HBO series, in anticipation of the release of this book.  I did not particularly enjoy book 4 (often skimming through endless repetitive descriptions of what people were wearing or eating...)--this book was better and also focused on characters I care more about.  That being said, the time lag between book 4 and 5 is ridiculous (considering GRRM wrote in the end of the last book that he had already completed book 5 and that it would be out in a year or so!).  Will I really care about these characters and the series in another 5 or 6 years?  Admittedly, it will probably take HBO about 2 to 3 years to make all of the \\"seasons\\" of 8 episodes to somewhat tell the story to this point.  We could expect the next episode of \\"I am making lots of money\\" to come out shortly after one of the HBO \\"seasons\\".  The storyline seems to have degenerated into an \\"I am milking this for millions\\" epic, multi-POV, never-ending story a la' \\"The Wheel of Time\\" (which I have ceased to care about after reading the first 8 or 9 volumes--the story is stale and boring and I hope the same thing doesn't happen to this series).  The use of cliffhangers, killing off major characters, miraculous resurrections in the next book, slowly advancing major plot lines, etc. etc. all contribute to a sense that GRRM is just banking on laughing all the way to the bank and making this a long tortuous epic with no end in sight.  He could write an entire book about people sitting around and eating and what they were wearing and how they got there and people would buy it (for now)--oh wait, he did!  WHATEVER, for now-- this is a great story, I care about some of the characters, and I want to know what happens next.  I hope I still feel that way after the next installment...which hopefully won't be 6 years from now!allment...which hopefully won't be 6 years from now!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|And i gave in to temptation when i bought this ebook from Amazon after reading the sample from my Kindle. Is it worth the purchase? Yes. The 4-star-rating mainly covers the first half of the book, the second half is just a 3 (bordering on 2, actually).<br /><br />Abby is flying under the radar at her university but she still catches the eye of resident bad boy, Travis. From UNlike-at-first-sight to being friends, Abby and Travis trudged on to the very rocky road to love.<br /><br />RAVES<br /><br />1. cocky and sexy banter b/w Abby and Travis at the beginning<br />2. Travis is my ultimate bad boy book boyfriend! Fighter, Tattoos, straight A student. Oh, Trav, I am willing to be a groupie!<br />3. Travis' UFC scenes - more in the lines of the movies Never Back Down and Fight Club<br />4. Poker scene with the Maddox family - dysfunctional but it works on them<br />5. America - whoa, i wanna be friends with that girl!<br /><br />RANTS<br /><br />1. i think the book is too long.<br />2. too much drama on Abby-Travis relationship<br />3. Travis got sappy, clingy, needy when he and Abby finally hooked up. I did not see that coming. Nothing turns me off like a guy who stalks, begs and pleads from a girl to take him back. He could've been a perfect male lead, but the 2nd half of the book destroyed him.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a surprising good read and i really like it despite my rants. I can recommend for you to read and start this one, but after the first half, if you reach the drama hype of Abby-Travis relationship, decide on your own if you're going to finish it.<br /><br />P.S. That is one captivating book cover, i tell you.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|It has been nearly 25 years since I checked out a new Woody Allen film. I was a huge fan of his work in the late 60's and the 1970's but for the most part Woody kinda lost me after that. Several weeks ago a friend called me raving about \\"Midnight In Paris\\". He didn't tell me a whole lot about it but assured me that I would love it. I took the day off today and one of the things on my \\"to do\\" list was to check out this flick. I went to an 11:15 A.M. screening this morning and although there only about 10 people in the theater I wanted to stand up and cheer when they rolled the credits. For me \\"Midnight In Paris\\" was a sheer delight.  In fact, this is a film that I would definitely like to see again.<br /><br />\\"Midnight In Paris\\" stars Owen Wilson as aspiring novelist Gil Pender and Rachel McAdams as his lovely fiancee Inez.  The couple are visiting \\"The CIty of Light\\" with Inez's parents.  Gil and Inez seem very much in love as the film opens but cracks quickly begin to develop in the relationship.  Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter who has simply become bored with his work and dreams of living and working in Paris the way the great artists and writers of the 1920's did.  Inez has other ideas.  She longs for the glamorous life in Malibu with all of the amenities.  Inez is definitely going to be high maintenance.  Gil feels at one with this place and wants to explore the streets of the city and savor the essence of Paris.  Inez prefers to go off with friends and take in the art galleries and museums.  They are slowly drifting apart.  Gil's life would forever change one evening when at the stroke of midnight a limo pulls up alongside him and the occupants invite him to join them.  Suddenly and remarkably Gil finds himself  smack dab in the middle of the 1920's Paris he has always read and dreamed of.  Furthermore he has the opportunity to meet and greet several of the legendary figures who were living in Paris at that time.  That list would include writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T.S. Eliot, the legendary songwriter Cole Porter along with jazz great Josephine Baker and a group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Paul Gauguin.  Gil desperately wants to show Inez what he has been experiencing but only he is allowed to enter into this bizarre netherworld.  During his travels Gil also meets a ravishing young lady named Adriana (Marion Cotillard) with whom he has much in common.  Here finally is a place where he feels fulfilled.  Meanwhile, as you might expect all of these improbable events do not bode well for the future of Gil and Inez's relationship.<br /><br />I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoyed \\"Midnight In Paris\\".  The views of Paris both during the day and at night were nothing short of stunning.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission.  And in the finest tradition of Woody Allen films the music was also tremendous.There are a whole host of great selections from that era.  The acting was superb and the writing top drawer.  Woody Allen has outdone himself this time.  \\"Midnight In Paris\\" is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by teens and seniors and everyone in between.  Very highly recommended!nest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T.S.

B003DO13NS|1.0|I have all of Mike's albums and I was really disappointed in this one. Not his finest, and very poor in composition.Will be gathering dust in the collection
B0012Y1J3K|4.0|UPDATE: [I am adding this in response to a comment] If you are not familiar with Brahms it would probably be better to buy selected pieces of his compositions instead of this large box set. The quality of the set is high, but the performers are not regarded as the top of the line. However, the perception of a reviewer does not necessarily correspond with another potential listener. Therefore all reviews are opinions that may or may not be agreed upon when another listener hears the same pieces.  My own experience is that listening to classical music leads to very subjective views of performers and pieces that potentially can lead to very long arguments into the night.  This Brahms set is so cheap so you cannot go wrong in case you would like to experience Brahms. It will also serve as a reference point. I would not personally pick the Brahms canon from this set (e.g. Symphonies, Piano Concertos, Requiem) since there are many superior performances.  However, I have had much joy exploring the chamber music and the vocal music in the collection. I have come across pieces in this collection that I would not normally have acquired, and this is the beauty about these types of box sets. As you are drawn to certain pieces you can expand your collection of those by listening to other performances. My point is that a box set like this one is simply a reference point for exploring Brahms' music. At this price (a little more than a dollar per cd) you cannot go wrong, which of course is part of Brilliant Classics' strategy. So if you have heard some of the more famous Brahms pieces (e.g. the symphonies) and now are curious about Brahms and his music there is really no better starting point.<br /><br />Some physical aspects: The 60 cds come in a sturdy cardboard box that you open from the top. The contents (summary) of each cd is printed on the backside of the box. The cds are inserted into relatively sturdy cardboard sleeves which have the information of the music printed on the back of it (which is nice - EMI often fails to do this). The sleeves are numbered and color coded so it is easy to navigate. In addition, there is an extra cd that contains digital information (track lists, biography, liner notes, texts of the vocal works, and printable versions of the liner notes and texts of the vocals).<br /><br />__________________________<br />ORCHESTRAL MUSIC:<br />1: Symphony No. 1<br />Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra, Jaap van Zweden<br />2: Symphony No. 2<br />Radio Filharmonisch Orkest Holland, Jaap van Zweden<br />3.

B000RP4LEO|5.0|When I heard her performance in a Beethoven documentary, I immediately went and purchased the CD. Something about her interpretation of Beethoven sonatas is incredible. I'm a teenager with a varied taste in music, but this is some of the best classical music I've ever heard.
B001WCN23W|4.0|This is a review of the 2CD Deluxe version of Sticky Fingers, released in June 2015.<br /><br />I've only rated this re-release as four stars, although Sticky Fingers is one of the best albums of the Rolling Stones' extensive catalogue and certainly one of the classic albums of the 1970s. If you're collecting 1970s music, you need to have this CD.<br /><br />But the reason I'm giving this edition 4 stars instead of the five that Sticky Fingers deserves is that the full capacity of the 2 CDs has not been used.<br /><br />CD 1 is the material on the original vinyl LP release, clocking in at just over 46 minutes playing time. There are no bonus tracks or extra material on CD1. CD 2 is five tracks of studio out takes from the Sticky Fingers sessions and 5 Stones live tracks from 1971, clocking in at a total playing time of just over 54 minutes.<br /><br />Since a vinyl LP only held about 40 minutes of music - twenty minutes per side - and CDs were designed to hold 75 minutes of music, I think that the full playing time of both CDs in the Deluxe version should have been used by filling it up with bonus tracks. I have no doubt that the Rolling Stones archives contain a lot of top quality material from this period which could have been used. But it wasn't, so one star deducted.<br /><br />Having said that, Sticky Fingers is one of the essential 1970s albums and this 2 CD Deluxe set is still a worthwhile version, despite the full CD storage capacity not being used.
0843189673|5.0|Loved these books when I was a kid and my 3 year old loves them too. It's a great case as well. Hope they make more collections like this!
B001EN1R2M|5.0|I listened to this CD ALL the time when I as MUCH younger and I loved it!!! So I decided to order it and it brought back some great memories and love it just as much many, many years later!!! Glad I purchased it!!!  ;)
B005869U6G|4.0|Hello all!    I understand why a lot of people are very disapointed with this album. A lot of people have said they have listened to the samples and didnt like what they heard, or the album isnt like their old stuff. I say, you have to listen to the whole album as a whole to get the whole jist of it. I know we all love the highly talented upbeat music of Incubus, but that doesnt mean they have a gentle side as well, dont we all?     I personally think that this album really completes the circle of Incubus's albums. You have each album that offers a different feel, but this album really has its own feel. With this album, Incubus has touched the softer side of their music. If you really look at the big picture of all of Incubus's music, you can now listen to each of their albums at a different state of mind. Unlike the other albums Incubus has put out, they finally have put out an album for those times you are trying to chill out, making a long night drive, or caught up in any other relaxing situation.    Now to actually get inside the album....The top four songs in my eyes are \\"If Not Now, When?\\", \\"Promises, Promises\\", \\"The Original\\", and \\"Adolescents\\".    I really hope that everyone who is skeptical of this album really sucks it up and gives this album a true listen. I dont think you will be distrot. If anyone is a real Incubus fan, you really owe that to them.
1451629184|5.0|I am not a huge fan of reading, but this book had me totally enthralled in everything she had to say. What an incredible story. I cannot even come close to imagining something of the sort happening to me. For only having a fifth grade education, I'd say she wrote this book very well. I know it must have been hard for her to flash back through everything like she has. Everyone should read this book and donate to her JAYC foundation ([...]). I've already bought my pinecone pendant. I feel terrible for her, but to see her spirit shine through after everything she has been through is absolutely inspirational. Everyone should read this. It makes me appreciate my life a lot more.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee's resilience, honesty and courage amaze me.  I lived fairly close to South Lake Tahoe at the time of her kidnapping and it greatly affected me.  It changed the way I supervised my children.  I think it changed America much the same way that Adam Walsh's kidnapping and murder a decade earlier changed us all.      I can hear the young eleven year old girl in Jaycee's writing.  I am so glad she is finally being given the chance to grow and experience the ability to be FREE!  I hope that all those who continue to hound her and her girls for photos realize that they are taking away her freedom even still.      Thank you Jaycee for sharing your story with us.  You and your family are an inspiration.  I hope you are given the chance to experience true freedom in your life.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Incubus never ceases to amaze me. Every album of theirs is a different style. What surprises me are all the negative reviews I'm hearing here. It isn't like their last album or their albums before this, but that's what makes it so fresh. I like this better than a crow left of the murder and light grenades. Personally, I don't think Incubus will ever suck. Just too much creativity and chemistry between the band.
0061726826|5.0|Wow, \\"deadliest of all deadly things\\". I've read about love before, but haven't seen or heard it described like that! This is one dystopian story that focuses on the emotional connection among the characters as much as the society in which they live, which makes for a more personal and interesting story. The author does an incredible job of building a society where love in it's many forms is held up for examination...love between and by parents, siblings, friends and those of the same gender...    The storyline touches on a number of interesting ideas and perhaps the one of greatest impact, what a society is willing to give up in lieu of personal freedoms is seamlessly woven throughout to great effect. The use of characters who had never known another way of life was thought provoking when played against the lives of sympathizers and the \\"Invalids\\". As the story unfolds, the reader gets to explore the idea of how ceding human rights and humanity by allowing politicians and governments to determine what is or isn't safe is scary and [for THIS adult reader] too familiar for comfort --\\"a cautionary tale\\" indeed.    This book would be a great read-along/compare-contrast for middle school students studying the holocaust. The parallels of how a society goes about marginalizing a segment of its population (Invalids) and then determining that if they can't make them disappear from memory that deadly force against them is acceptable would lead to interesting class discussion.    Along with the bigger ideas presented in the story, other situations more familiar to the daily lives of teens are woven in as well, \\"I'd never understood how Hana could lie so often and so easily. But just like anything else, lying becomes easier the more you do it.\\" hmmmm....  I will be recommending this book to teens in my library who are exploring this type of fiction. The book's references to running will likely make it 'a sure thing' for girls who love running or cross-country as a sport.

B000X2H8G4|4.0|found them helpful      so mine......  i like the product. i bought it more for fun than anything else though i am a little hard of hearing, and this thing is quite cool, I've tested it almost thoroughly, and have found that,    1) it picks up high frequency sound with ease,   2)low freq sound with low amplitude is audible but limited, ie you cant hear someone  breath hard but if the amplitude is high you'll hear it, even with 3 fans going on in the room and 2 doors closed. of course the greater the distance the weaker the audibility,    its like listening to sonar, you will need to listen for awhile to be able to understand what you are listening to, and be able to discern between mechanical sounds, biologic, and mechanical sounds initiated by a biologic.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|its awesome. i love the actions the most thats the reason why i watched the movie!i wasnt disappointed. but it was sad.a sad ending, good though.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|I wanted to hate this album. No Anderson, no Wakeman. Problem is, I love it. I can't stop listening to it.  No, it isn't Relayer or Close to the Edge. But, Benoit David sounds terrific, Geoff Downes is a beast,  the songwriting is wonderful and Trevor Horn does a great job producing. To me, the weakest songs are \\"Bumpy Ride\\" and \\"The Man ...\\" from Squire. Good, but not great, which is why I gave the CD 4 and not 5 stars. Steve Howe - guitar god!    I hope they keep this lineup for a long time!

0553801473|2.0|The first two books in the Martin series were utterly compelling; I couldn't put them down. I was immersed in the story lines, and the character development was truly outstanding. Unfortunately, as the series went on, Martin began going off on frustrating tangents that weakened the original stories. In the fourth book, rather than bringing satisfying conclusions and telling the original stories, he brought in a multitude of peripheral story lines and characters. Why not just begin another series altogether? Honestly, I found myself simply skimming along and bored with the fourth book, but had hopes that the fifth would bring closure. I hardly dare bring in such a canaille comparison, but it reminds me of the silly \\"Left Behind\\" series I read as an 8th grader, wherein there could be no explanation for the release of book after book without any real plot movement. The only possible reasons would be either financial gain or poor writing skills. I stopped reading those because I got bored. After the fifth book in Martin's series, I am about to stop bothering with his books, as well. I am bored. Bored and frustrated. This could have been another truly compelling book, but it's just silly. It just continues to string readers along, wishing for something worthwhile, wishing for some closure. I used to share the original books with enthusiasm, but my appreciation has waned. Very, very frustrating. What a disappointment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't want to read this book. If you look at the majority of my past reviews you will notice I tend to stray from popular, bestseller novels as I often times find them overwritten, overhyped, and typically very boring works of fiction. Then there is the fact that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is usually referred to as a \\"Young Adult\\" novel where it will undoubtedly be grouped with books about lovestruck teenage vampires, lovestruck teenage werewolves, lovestruck teenage wizards, and lovestruck teenage students. \\"The Hunger Games\\" has so many things going against it, it's a surprise I even sat down and decided to read it at all.    But, the bigger surprise, is that I LOVED this book. Not since the 2 part epic disasterpiece \\"Flood/Ark\\" by Stephen Baxter have I been so enthralled and so wrapped up in characters, story and plot.     Where \\"The Hunger Games\\" succeeds is hard to pinpoint because it succeeds in so many places. First there's the incredible plot. Too many times in post-apocalyptical fiction we are presented with one of two ideas: a bleak barren future with no hope, or a technologically advanced society that rises from the ashes and begins anew. \\"The Hunger Games\\" melds both of those ideas into one uncannily believable plot that one wonders if the author, Suzanne Collins, can see into the coming future. Think about it: a destroyed United States of America, a communist run state, an eagerly anticipated and much hyped gladiator type fight to the death?     And that brings us to the plot, which, is outstanding as well. Like I say in most of my reviews, you can get a much more in-depth synopsis from someone else, but the idea of Katniss, plunged into a fight to the death match of wits, brawn and survival was so well written and flowed along so nicely that it was impossible to put this one down. Like most good books I read, I flew through this one in a matter of only 2 days.    Finally, major praise goes to Suzanne Collins. Much like J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame, Collins is an amazing author who obviously knows how to write a successful, addicting, and thoroughly enjoyable novel. Not since the just mentioned Harry Potter series have I read a series book that I enjoyed this much.     There is literally nothing, yes you read that right, NOTHING, that I can say in way of criticism here. Honestly, this is one of the most perfect novels I have read and I cannot wait until I get my hands on the 2nd one \\"Catching Fire\\".
B0050KEVO6|5.0|this game is fantastic. Its an addicting, fun thinkers game. You will catch your self thinking of combinations all the time.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The decade journey closes ( longer for those of us on board with the release of the Philosopher's Stone ). Yates , WB and the cast have done a fine job ( w/ both parts), changes from the books made were less painful than earlier film cuts, although the occasional monologuing of exposition occurs, like Harry explaining wand lore and who the elder wand belongs to... May they didn't do enough of this, even, I thought Harry's on-screen Horcrux Math was lacking, if I hadn't read the material I questioned how it was condensed here. Harry actually says \\" there's one Horcrux left ... I hope the less literate members of the audience could keep up with these potentially confusing leaps.  That complaint aside...The scenes in this story were ready made for cinema ... Breaking into and out of the Gringott's wizard bank, which even on screen is established as the most secure place in the very first adventure. Other homages to the decade of Potter history are made ofcourse... Basilisk anyone? Again I say the cast has done a super job in making us care about these characters , good and evil for what amounts to a 16 hour experience ... Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are over the top as expected, but subtile performances are in the mix like, Dame Maggie Smith's at times elegant Prof. McGonagall portrayal, briefly many other Hogwarts cameos ( surprising how many students are still onboard from Year One). As for Harry, Ron and Hermione, they may have delivered their best work to date, but they are so comfortable with each other as with the characters that is seems pretty effortless ... Although I wonder if even they can make the distinction at this point .... Mischief Managed, y'all .

Some critics here tend to think the book is better than the movie, but until you've seen the poor kid running through an old folk's home in nothing but his UNDERWEAR and the hilarious pranks pulled against each other, y'all have no right to judge! I laughed like crazy from beginning to end. Some days, it feels so good to laugh and these movies will do it for you! Hope they make more of them. I enjoyed this movie a lot!
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey has a brilliant style of humor that can even make stories of workplace discrimination funny. She gives a behind-the-scenes look at her work on SNL and playing Sarah Palin that is intruiging and incredibly witty. Her insights on the world of comedy and the women-just-aren't-funny judgements that gave me a new perspectve and left me crying with laughter.  The audiobook version is read by Ms. Fey and her voice inflection brings the jokes to another level, plus she added some tibits to the audiobook that aren't in the text.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I saw \\"Rio\\" yesterday in Blu-ray with an Infocus 1080p projector in 130\\". The video quality is unbelievable!!! The movie is great too. Maybe the best made in this category. The Rio de Janeiro city is well represented but, of course, the great problems we have in Rio de Janeiro and in all the others great or small cities of my country Brasil (like cocaine, crack, guns, corruption) isn't showed in the movie. Well, it is to be a happy movie and full of hope. Great, great, great work by the brasilian citizen and director Carlos Saldanha and his crew.
140053271X|3.0|Just a short review of my two weeks with the Nook Simple Touch.  This looked the the reader to get when it came out.  Specifically for me the touch screen was a must.  I enjoyed reading on it everyday until I returned it.  It was light and extremely easy to navigate with its touch screen.  What happened though, was on about the 12th day while using it the touch screen stopped responding.  I couldn't turn a page with the screen or pull up a menu with the screen or do anything else.  And, when I shut it off and turned it back on I couldn't swipe the screen to get into the book - I was completely stuck...locked out.  Finally after fiddling with it after about 15 minutes it started to work again.  I went on the web and found out that others had this same thing happen to them so I decided to return it rather then hope for a fix (I was still within my 14 days return policy).
B004WJRF6C|5.0|Of course, Paul had to start his remaster series with Band on the Run, being one of his biggest sellers, and of course he was busy with the Beatles remaster campaign (high time for that as well).  That said, what was the delay with McCartney being released, at long last?  For one thing, it was his first solo album, and it was one of his nicest ones.  This is a much better album than casual listeners and critics would give him credit for.  He was rediscovering himself as a musician, getting to know himself again.  There are no major political or social statements here, just Paul relaxing and learning to enjoy life again, and this is the start of the result.  Junk and Teddy Boy were two songs he'd auditioned for a Beatles album, but these were rebuffed, only to finally see the light of day on this album.  Oo You and Momma Miss America are two great guitar jams, which segue qite nicely into Singalong Junk, which sets the stage for what should have been a breakthrough smash single, Maybe I'm Amazed.  I was definitely amazed he managed to play all the instruments himself as it sounded like a full band album in 1970, the start of a period in which rock music in general was streamlined - no crazy, over-the-top, albeit much beloved, late 60s experimentation.  Listening to this album again after purchasing the remaster even warmed me up to Kreen-Akrore, which was not a huge favorite of mine.  My only problem was it was so quiet before, it was a bit irritating to listen to in such low fidelity, but its quality is brought out via digital remastering.  The guitar solo and wordless harmonies are a nice way to close this album, and I feel this should be given a good chance.  I am so looking forward to the remastering of the rest of his catalogue.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|If you are a Foo Fighters fan, you are going to love this DVD. If you're not a big fan, this might make you more of a fan.  The DVD goes through all the band member changes the Foos had over the years. Great insight into the history of the FF. It also talks about Dave's time in Nirvana and the death of Curt Kobain, and the other bands he and the band members were in and much more. Nicely done, interesting, funny and light hearted at times, and heavy at times...Really great DVD that I would recommend to anyone who likes rock music, and of course, if you're a big Foos fan like me, it's a MUST have.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|Viewed: 2/05, 2/06, 7/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />2/06: Take a delicate, pretty flower. It's all about \\"Oh Dahling,\\" \\"Precious things,\\" and the likes. Enter an animal who tears it all up and smashes it all into pieces. That's what happened between Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski. A Streetcar Named Desire is a fast, furious film that redefines the word acting. It is an important film in terms of acting, emotions, character work, and censorship issue. Marlon Brando, in this film, makes a name for himself as the most influential actor for the next generation of actors that would come and take what was so evident of Brando's style. Vivien Leigh tops herself in A Streetcar Named Desire, over what she had done in Gone with the Wind. Never again acting will be this good as compared to what Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh have done in A Streetcar Named Desire. This is all about naked passion, raw emotions, and fire in clash with sensitivity, pretentiousness, and airiness. In the end, A Streetcar Named Desire is truly revered for setting standards of what a film is supposed to be all about. All in all, A Streetcar Named Desire contains an outstanding cast giving tremendous performances with a brilliant story that is marvelously directed by Elia Kazan.<br /><br />7/11: A Streetcar Named Desire is a landmark film because it is about a changing of guards between Old Hollywood and New Hollywood through Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando. Obviously, the cast was intimidated by Marlon's presence, and Vivien stayed with him mightily throughout the film to the point of giving the third greatest acting performance in screen history. Finally, it's Marlon who steals the film and becomes an overnight superstar based on his raw animalism and indescribable method acting. It's unlike any kind of acting seen before the film, and he should be rightly credited for single-handedly changing acting as it was known before that time. A Streetcar Named Desire is an important film for this reason alone. Every time I see it, I see greatness, and I see nothing else but Brando and Vivien's titanic performances. All in all, Elia Kazan does something so remarkable in A Streetcar Named Desire that we all forget that it was supposed to be a theatrical play.ne.

B004HO6I4M|4.0|I loved the movie Ice Age and when I heard this was from the same studio I figured I'd give it a chance, even though I don't really like birds.  I didn't think the movie could be so active and fun to watch with a bunch of boring birds as the main characters.  I was wrong, the birds are great and there are even a few other animal characters!  The animation and colors in the movie are so vibrant and rich that it was hard to not watch it!<br /><br />The movie is about two birds who are amongst the last of their species and are expected to mate.  The birds then get kidnapped and struggle to escape.  Blu was raised as a housebird and therefore never actually learned to fly!  The story is set in Brazil which is a unique and fun environment to set the story in.  There are also some great voices behind the characters, especially Blu's voice (Jesse Eisenberg from The Social Network.)<br /><br />My husband and I watched this with our 3 and 4 year old but honestly I would watch it again without them.  It is a cute story and the animation is really incredible.  Great for the whole family regardless!
B004WS7QN0|4.0|It is ironic that I write this review in the week that sees the demise of the British tabloid `News of the World' after which the Queen 1977 album was named. This strong and increasingly commercial Queen album came after 'Day at the races' and shows experimentation and a departure from the classic early Queen sound of their first five albums. So now it was bye bye progressive rock elements and hello to the embracing of popular rock, new influences and experimentation. This is Queen at their peak in the 70's trying to deal with the unveiling of the forces of punk and hard rock. (1977 saw both the arrival of `The Clash' and `Van Halen'). And this is how they responded...<br /><br />The album opens with possibly the world's most popular song chant of the last 30 years - from cheering sports fans of a hundred nationalities, teenagers, middle-class professionals, high society, to school children and grandparents - nearly everyone has at sometime participated in the community stomp and hand clap and joyful shout of `We will, we will rock you'. Most of these millions may not have heard of Brian May but this single has since played at every Queen concert followed closely by `We are the champions'. These two worldwide hit songs alone make this album a standout. The only reason this album is not Queen's quintessential great album is because the incredibly high standards of their previous albums like `Night at the Opera'.<br /><br />I like the 2011 `News of the World' case like all the 2011 remasters, but was surprised to see no additional photos with the CD lyrics. Perhaps these only come with the deluxe version? I also find the sound quality improvements not nearly as noticeable as what I did with the \\"Queen 2\\" 2011 remaster. (See my review '2011 Remaster compared to 1991 Queen 2, April 1, 2011').<br /><br />Again what is noticeable is that when comparing the two versions, I turn down the 2011 remaster as the volume has been lifted. Like with the `Day at the Races' remaster, each time I thought how great a track sounded on the 2011, I was surprised that when I raised the volume listening to 1991 remaster it sounded as good. Having said that, I do like the increased volume of the 2011 remaster, it is just not fair to compare the two versions at different volumes as you think you are hearing the detail of the bass and greater vocal definition whereas it is because it is louder.<br /><br />I will comment briefly on three tracks where I thought the 2011 remaster definitely showed improvement. One of my favourite Queen tracks of all time, `Spread your wings' shows a big improvement in the cleaning up of excess sound around the drums, bass and cymbals. The snare drum sound that previously bled into the overall sound especially during choruses and louder sections, is more defined and crisper and bass has more tone where it previously tended to boom. You hear more detail of the cymbals including when Roger hits on the bell of the cymbal and the wash does not seem to blur into the overall sound. So overall when listening to the song, you hear a clearer, more detailed and defined sound of all the instruments and voice.<br /><br />\\"Get down, make love\\" a track that first showed the darker, decadent side of Queen, sounds menacingly clear with amazing bass work from John Deacon that I've never noticed before. The drums crack with a force and the spaces between seem to emphasise the cutting cymbals.<br /><br />The hard rocking \\"It's late\\" sounds so much better. Because of the intensity of guitars, banks of vocal harmonies and sheer power, the intense sections previously sounded loud and possibly messy. There is now increased definition that allows you to hear a separation of the growl of the guitar and cymbals. I've always liked this track but enjoyed this so much more hearing the tones of Brian's guitar at the outset, plus more sense of the vocal richness rather than just loudness with all the other instruments in the final section.<br /><br />ForQueen fans - we buy in the hope that this is indeed a better sound quality. For listeners who already have the 1991 remaster - consider carefully whether it is worth the repurchase as the older 1991 remaster holds up as a good recording. And for those who only have Queen Greatest hits packages, buy this. You'll be pleasantly surprised with the variety of styles and the sheer brilliance of this quartet.better sound quality.

B004Y1USV2|1.0|\\"Fly From Here\\" is a disaster.  I must confess that as a 40-year Yes fan, I have long felt any Yes album without both (vocalist) Jon Anderson and (bassist) Chris Squire was probably not a Yes album.  This effort bears this out.    Squire is here, with (guitarist) Steve Howe and (drummer) Alan White.  Geoff Downes has a few pretty moments on keyboards, and to his credit Benoit David does not try to replicate Anderson's vocal style: he's good enough to not have to.    But the title opus that makes up half of the album's 48 minute length goes nowhere.  In form (though not in style) it will remind us Prog Fans of ELP's \\"Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman\\": absolutely nothing happens.  At least there were a few tasty piano bits buried in \\"Memoirs\\": so far with \\"Fly\\" I've only perked up at those fleeting synth treatments referred to earlier.    The album gets better, perhaps all the way to \\"fair\\", in its remaining five tracks.  Two are Howe compositions, including an instrumental with more accompaniment than Howe usually features, and that sounds quite good.    But honestly, Yes fans, this disc sounds like well-recorded Starcastle, only with less imagination.  \\"Fly From Here\\"s finest feature is offering closure.
B004XZ99LO|1.0|I am a fanatical fan of Cirque du Soleil, and I was waited eagerly for the release of the 3D Blu-ray<br />version of this Cirque du Soleil Journey of Man.  When I received it, it was played on a<br />58\\" Panasonic Viera 3D Full High Definition TV + a Panasonic Threatre Sound System combined<br />with an ORB Audio System; but still I was dismay about the 3D effects qualities of this disc (need to<br />say that that I can't bet of receiving a dude copy).<br />Unliked to the Cirque du Soleil stage show, the underwater swimming synchronization was<br />excellent but its surrounded environment was that cloudly as if it was videotaped in a dirty cow-<br />trough; the forest captures were as if made by a cheap filmmaker's camera; and only fair few other<br />parts of the movie pertaining to rocky & hilly natural scenery were in 3D effects (but in depth<br />ONLY, never came out of the screen); and the beautifully related \\"Journey of man\\"story lines that<br />accompany the performances was cramped into a 39 minutes \\"Much Ado about Nothing\\" dull<br />movie with seasonal 3D effects.  As I see it, Cirque Du Soleil had been discredited by the release of<br />its performances in that 3D version.  My recommendation to mainstream 3D filmmakers are to<br />stick to creature-features movies when trying to convert 2D into 3D; because you are all hell bent<br />on 3d-ing old 2Ds movies instead of producing fresh 3D Blu-ray movies from the start; I would say<br />that there are so many family-friendly movies in the last decade, hence I also know that most<br />filmmakers are turning to already created creature-feature 2D movies that they can convert into 3D<br />Blu-ray movies; and at least their created 3Ds do look better that this one I am reviewing now with<br />a 1 STAR rating.<br />N.B.: To buyers I would suggest you do keep your hard-earned dollars (even your wilfully-earned<br />dollars are worth keeping) for better 3Ds and leave this one on the distributors' and/or retailers'<br />shelves; no offence to amazon.com because that will not stop me purchasing all my 3D movies from<br />amazon; take my advice and Have A Nice Day.e purchasing all my 3D movies from   amazon; take my advice and Have A Nice Day.
0802130208|3.0|I felt the same way after reading this novel as I did after watching the movie \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\" Both are critically acclaimed, both won awards, and both were (are?) marketed as comedies...and both left me feeling like I was somehow tricked into spending my time on them. Also, both are really more like tragic character studies with a few funny scenes thrown in to keep you from falling into a depressive stupor as the characters' lives spiral downward.    I came to read this novel after hearing so much about how hilarious it is. For sure, the narrative, and in particular, I.J. Reilly's character hooked me into wanting to read more. But gut-busting-funny it was not. For one, the main character is an extremely odious and dis-likable person that just made me want to punch something every time he opened his mouth. Secondly, all the supporting characters are just as tragic and fairly dis-likable themselves (except maybe Jones or Angelo, who are merely pathetic). I guess you could consider it a mark of writing genius that such an attention-getting story was crafted from such horrible people, although I suppose its success may depend largely on readers who enjoy others' misfortunes?     In any case, there isn't much plot to speak of. This novel is more like a study of people's lives, and follows several characters around on their various misadventures, and how their lives all connect at some point. If you're looking for a fast-paced or action-driven story, this isn't it. The characters themselves are completely fascinating, and it's worth reading, if for no other reason than to get into the world of some truly bizarre and train-wreck-like people. I felt like the ending was abbreviated, but it's possible the author had intended to write more episodes in I.J. Reilly's life at some point.    Overall, I gave this book three stars mainly for false advertising. It's actually a pretty tragic novel, and I wasn't really prepared for a bit of melancholy right before bed. Also, Ireally disliked the characters, and it's hard to enjoy a book when you hate what you're reading. And while it was not particularly explicit, it was rather vulgar and suggestive at parts, and that can be a turn-off for anyone who leans toward more tasteful material. Worth reading once, if you have a strong stomach.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Comment: Wow... You have to pay close attention to this one so you can understand where this film is going. Being an \\"older citizen\\" I have a little trouble following how \\"todays\\" stories unfold. For some people, me included it helps to know a small amount about the plot before engaging the movie. For me it kept me glued to the action but trying to figure out what that most excellent action had to do with the overall scheme of things. At the end it all came together for me... and I was a little upset that it was ending this way (to the character). This movie gave me an \\"E ticket\\" ride in entertainment. As an aside, I would love to see all the dance (dream) sequences played together as it's own movie. Please don't tell be I can do that with a Blu-ray... I am just saying. So, after I figured the movie out I thought it was outstanding.

0553382152|5.0|I have seen this book on the bookshelf at the book store and never had the urge to read it.  But after the death of my father, I was at a thrift store and there it was staring me in the face.  I decided, \\"What the heck\\" and bought it.  After reading it I felt calm and at ease.  It helped me through the grieving process of my father's death and gave me hope.  Whether people claim it is new age or mormon material or whatever, says nothing to the comfort it gives a person in despair.  I think a lot of people are tired of the same ole mechanical Christian theology of old and are thirsting for something fresh and new.  I am not saying authors need to start making things up or changing the truth, I am saying this generation needs to hear it taught in fresh new ways.  This book is a must read.
B004RSCWZ2|1.0|I expected so much more. I have been listening to Derek Trucks for a long time now, and seldom have had the disappointment that this album brings. While the band and Trucks are performing fine and sound great on most selections on this CD, the Tedeschi vocals are horrible.  This woman just cannot sing. Every song has that grating, shouting, musicless voice taking over. Nothing musical or pleasing about this Tedeschi voice, she should limit her contributions (if deemed needed at all) to playing an instrument. Let someone who has a pleasing voice to listen to sing the lyrics. I cannot and will not listen to this album again, the Tedeschi voice is so painful to my ears. It is truly a shame what most Americans have come to accept in the music world these days, from the frightful noise of hip-hop and rap to singers like Tedeschi on this album. It would be nice to get some good real music in our lives again, which is what I expected when I purchased this album, but sadly, disappointment seems to the the fare for the day. I wish that I could remove Tedeschi from this album, it then probably would be well worth a good listen.
B004R0WKNE|1.0|This may have been the worst \\"romantic comedy\\" I've ever seen.  There was no comedy nor romance, instead this movie is about an annoying young woman who works too hard.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|You would be better off imagining your own ending to the series rather then purchasing this one. The one word I can use to describe this installment is anticlimactic. It turns out our beloved heroine whom all love and worship has no back bone at all, and I am trying to say this without giving away what happens for those of you poor souls who still feel the need to complete the series. Alas I too was among your ranks once. I devoured the first two books in one day and while I kept up a similar pace with this book it was only because my sister was waiting for it and I forced myself on. I hoped it would end with a bang that made up for the pages and pages of whining and crying reminiscent of the middle book in the twilight series... Ugh. Let's just say I was wishing that peeta, katniss, and gale would all die before the end.

I think I messed it up, but there's some simple proof that memory techniques *can* be useful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book isn't about teaching memory techniques. It's about Josh's journey to winning the biggest little award in the US... which is NOT why I set out to read this book.  My mistake.<br /><br />The overall story was interesting, there were some useful tips, and some real truths came out of the work.  However, this book is not, I repeat, about *teaching* the \\"Art and Science of Remembering Everything\\".  I will admit I went into the book expecting much in the way of being taught some useful skills so my rating reflects this entry bias.<br /><br />Read it for an entertaining tale of participative journalism. Read something else for working on your memory.
1594744769|4.0|Over all it was a good book. They left it open for a sequel without the promise of the delivery of one. (Which I don't really like when authors do this.)But it's fine I guess, because while he never ties up all loose ends, it's not a cliff hanger ending either. It's more like a point in the story where everyone is left to reevaluate because things didn't go as planned, and they have to figure out what their next move is going to be.<br />So while their ultimate goal is not reached, and maybe they're not as safe as the reader would want them to be, it's a shift in between phases and tactics.<br /><br />Another reason that some people gave this book low ratings was because they found the narration too mature coming from a 15 year old...<br />It's not as bad as some people claim. It's not like you have to read this with a dictionary in one hand. All the \\"big words\\" that they say he uses, aren't that big. I think in the duration of the whole book I found 2 words I didn't know, but they're used in such a way that you get the meaning of them simply from how he uses them in the sentence.<br />Plus, Jacob is from a small town, he has no real friends to speak of, the one person that he hangs out with, who he calls his \\"best friend\\", is called that for lack of a better word. Jacob all but says that in the book himself. And lastly, after the 'horrific family tragedy' occurs, Jacob is sent to a psychiatrist, who prescribes different pills to him as often as he changes clothes, which leaves him gaining weight.<br />All this is not exactly painting a picture of popularity. So his character reminds me of the fat, shy nerdy, unpopular loner type at schools, who if you take time to talk to them, turn out to be incredibly smart.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, while not the best book I've ever read, is by far, not the worst either. I have no problems recommending this book to others. The reason I gave it 4, not 5 stars, is because, well, it's not the best book I've ever read. And I'm still a little irked that he left it open ended. But he may just come back and write a sequel. He's left plenty to work with.still a little irked that he left it open ended.

At least, I hoped she would and I was determined to see it through. I won't be a spoiler, I'll just tell you that the story flows well and will not leave you bored. Buy it now!

B004XISI4A|3.0|A lot of people criticised GRR Martin for the wait of this book. I was not one of them, if quality takes time then we as readers must wait. After reading the book, You just have to wonder why  it took him so long to write this book?. Nothing is really resolved, the book goes in circles and often becomes a soap opera more concerned about furniture placements rather than the progression of the story. I would not be surprised that in a later date, he will extend this book to a 10 book series, there is so much to tell if Dance is any indication of his pace.<br />All I can say that I am 44 years old and I am seriously doubting that I will read the conclusion of this series anytime in the next decade.

I mean, she went on for what seemed like 40 pages about her cats and all of her journal entries about them I just didn't care to read. I know how they were a big part of her life and her sanity so I see why she wrote about them. All in all, it was a good book and I can't believe she went through what she did!
B00005JLR8|4.0|I fought this movie, the first time I watched it.  Today, at a re-viewing, backed up by playing the director's commentary, I have come to support it 100%.<br />Although commentaries are not always useful, Sheridan's is completely informal, personal, and authentic.  Some of the quieter voices are hard to catch from surrounding noise, which is a shame.  The performance of the young actor Emma Bolger is enough to make adults sit up straight and re-think; her script is Sheridan's, but her assumption of the role, done bravely, is all her own.  Paddy Considine is such a charmer, but this story squeezes him until the pips squeak, and a person behind the charm can emerge.  Samantha Morton too is excellent.  Altogether a rewarding movie.  Then just now I read, above,  the fatuous one-line dismissal by the almighty \\"Observer\\" critic who tossed the whole thing out of the window. Well, good luck to him and his sad career.  I recommend this movie.
B004VSTP4Y|2.0|I loved Shiver, which is probably one of my favorite paranormal romances of all time.  Linger... was okay.  But I decided to give Forever the benefit of the doubt and jumped in with both feet.    Well.    First of all, nothing happens for the first half of the novel, which consists of page after page of teenage angst, and I almost abandoned it more than once.  Thankfully, the pacing picked up for the second half, but in the end, it didn't save the book for me, for a couple of reasons.  First, I really believed in the romance between Grace and Sam back in Shiver but by Forever, it has sort of evaporated.  The two characters have so few moments between them that it's hard to understand what's supposed to be driving the story.  Isabel, to me, was completely one-dimensional, and Cole was only slightly better.    Then... the plot holes.  <<<SPOILERS>>>    At the end of Linger, we learn that Sam's cure isn't real, that the wolf-virus is still inside of him, and will eventually build up and kill him, like it almost killed Grace.  This is *completely ignored* in Forever, in which Sam is cured!  Cole spends the entire book trying to find a cure and, at the end, we're left with the same cure that supposedly didn't work two books earlier.  Another problem... Isabel's big \\"sacrifice\\" (???) that she makes by running out into the middle of the wolf hunt could have just as easily been performed by Cole two minutes earlier, and there's no explanation of why this doesn't occur to him.  And there are no consequences to her for doing this, either.  She gets grounded.  Wah.    Finally, the whole thing with Officer Koenig suddenly showing up and giving his inheritence to Sam is just so much Deus ex Machina.  It doesn't make any sense for a whole host of reasons.  (This guy somehow figured out werewolves on his own?  He accepts this wholeheartedly with no proof?  And he's giving away his family inheritence... to be nice?)    All in all, I was very disappointed with this story, from the slow pacing to the plot holes to the lack of any real emotional connection between the characters.  Oh, and the end, in which we expect to finally find out what happens with Sam and Grace?  Totally unsatisfying.  I think Stiefvater ought to have just left the series with the first book-- there just wasn't enough \\"story\\" here to warrant a trilogy.  It would have been terrific as a standalone novel.
B004VUP8WK|4.0|This album is taking an unfair beating because superficial elements such as lyric approach and electronica are not death metal aesthetics. After an eight year wait  (weight), there would be a lot of expectation involved....hard to overcome those things especially with such a Titan of music. I think people didn't get what they expected and had a violent reaction. I another longtime fan am not offended or embarrassed by this album whatsoever, I am however quite perplexed as to why this such a big deal.  Destructos is infinitely entertaining...you would have to be dead not to groove with this song. Awesome guitar work be Trey. As a guitar player that appreciates all types of music, I find this approach extremely interesting. There is some great riffing going on in those \\"horrible\\"songs. To me I can liken this to the UFO/religion debate.....I don't care how much evidence there is to prove something, some will not accept it and never will. This is not about the music, it about the \\"betrayal\\" that \\"fans\\" felt by adding elements not approved by death metal standards. Don't listen to the hate hype, that is just mob mentality happening online...this is a great and enjoyable album made by musicians who shaped metal as a whole. Listen without prejudice and you will enjoy this album.
B003ASLJMW|4.0|This was one of the first movies I saw on my first duty assignment in the USAF at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany (as it was in 1983).  The cold war was real, the Iron Curtain was real and intact, and the Fulda Gap separated the free West from the communist East.  Ok, the special effects are nothing like they are today, but back then, they weren't too bad.  Back then, there were fears that the Soviets would come up with a better plane than we had so the story is logical.  In the present, I have used parts of this film and others like Moscow on the Hudson [[ASIN:B00005QCTY Moscow on the Hudson]] to show my young son how life was in a communist country (since so many on the left these days think the US should turn from a Republic to Socialist nanny state).  This movie still brings back memories of my early days out on the rim of freedom, staring at the guns of our potential enemies.  Yeah, some parts of it are corny (really? melt a smooth runway on the icepack in only 5-minutes?) and the climax wasn't what I thought it should be, but overall, I do enjoy watching this movie.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|this movie is full of action , the 3d is amazing, the best movie I see on 3d highly recommended
B00574P9EQ|4.0|I loved this series and read them all even though I was a high school senior.  The first part of the movie seeing Greg doing those stuff just felt really dumb, but hey, prob every man in the world at that age done things stupid like that to get the attention of the cute girl in class.  Overall this is a great movie, met my expectation and made me crack a bit.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I don't buy many DVDs and I've never bought a complete series before.  We started watching West Wing via Netflix, but realized that the show was so well done, that we'd want to watch it again.  So, to make that easier, we pulled the trigger.  Actually, we just finished the last episode last night.  We plan on waiting a few months and then start all over.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Having been a Yes fan since 1975 (when my older brother turned me onto \\"The Yes Album\\", I have been a devout fan of the band, buying anything and everything ever released by the band. \\"\\"Fly From Here\\" to me is simply one more chapter in the Yes legacy. There have been many very thoughful, positive and a few negative reviews of the new Yes album, but that shows the passion of the fans, and I will not go into a song by song review of the album since there have been so many great reviews already posted concerning the content of the disc. Rather, I would like to share my thoughts on the band as a whole and the rather obvious wide range of Yes styles that have graced our LP's, Cassettes and CD's over the past 43 years of the bands existance. \\"Yes\\" and \\"Time and a Word\\" encompassed the band finding it's sound with little hints here and there of the music to come. \\"The Yes Album\\" was a departure from the first two discs as it introduced us to Steve Howe and the truly \\"progressive\\" side of the band, but the \\"Yes Album\\" as great as it is was a snapshot in history as Yes has never released another album quite like it. The \\"Fragile\\", \\"CTTE\\", \\"TFTO\\",\\"Relayer\\" & \\"Going for the One\\" usher in what most Yes fans view as the \\"true\\" Yes sound and compositional style, one of which has many reviewers both personal and professional often are referring to when the wish is for Yes to return to form. During the course of those five releases the band's style and progression from release to release did hold a commmon thread, but the content of the albums varied a great deal. \\"Sound Chaser\\" would not fit on \\"CTTE\\" anymore than \\"The Ritual\\" would fit on \\"Time in the Word\\", but the music of that phase of the band is what makes Yes music the groundbreaking progressive powerhouse they are.    After Going for the One the band has never reached the same level of Yes compositional style, from Tormato through the latest Fly From Here release, but we have been treated to some great music during this period, just not in the same groundbreaking sound and style of the 70's period. Beginning with Tormato in 1978 Yes has released 10 albums through 2011, clearly not equal in whole to the 70's catalog, but still Yes music nonetheless.    I am thankful for getting new Yes music in 2011 regardless of who is in the band, it continues on the Yes legacy and shows them moving forwad instead of resting on the past. Reading all the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere of the new album, especially in regards to Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman not being part of the band any longer, brings to mind an interview of Rick Wakeman on the 1996 Story of Yes DVD in which Wakeman says (and I paraphrase) that Yes Music is more of a concept or feeling than the sum of the parts of members of the band, no matter who those members may be. Wakeman goes on the say there very well may be a \\"Yes\\" long after he is dead and gone due to Yes music being this \\"concept\\".    No matter what your personal feelings are about the current lineup of the band or the \\"Fly From Here\\" release, it is still \\"Yes Music\\", and that fact is un-mistakable, not only on the Fly From Here CD but ALL yes music realased over the past 43 years. and I for one would much rather have Yes in any form be releasing Yes music in 2011 than to here of the demise of the band.     Just for fun I wanted to list the Yes members (having recorded music) over their 43 year career, and just by looking at this list it should make perfect sense as to the various sounds and styles of the band:    Vocals-Jon Anderson, Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin, Benoit David  Guitar-Peter Banks, Steve Howe, Trevor Rabin, Billy Sherwood (The Ladder)  Keyboards-Tony Kaye, Rick Wakeman, Patrick Moraz, Billy Sherwood, Igor Khoroshev, Geoff Downes, Oliver Wakeman  Drums-Bill Bruford, Alan White.  Bass-Chris Squire    After all these years, it's still Yes Music to me.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|What can a reviewer add after slightly over 100 reviewers have weighed in?  Well, the only thing is that particularly person's take on said matter.  With that in mind, here goes...This is Robert Plant's absolute finest post-zep album.<br /><br />Maturity is a strange thing, it can sink a artist's muse to the point where whatever that artist does is a shadow of former glories.  When the bar has been set as high as what Robert Plant has accomplished as a member of Led Zeppelin that would seem to be more likely than not.  In a way it is true since no matter what fine music he put out it would be hard to say one of his solo albums could stand with Led Zeppelin I thru IV.  Then there is all the other albums the group put out which certainly had many more highpoints.  Realizing this it is with complete seriousness that I say none of Plant's solo outings matched quite the total heights of that vaulted catalog.  Sure, there is plenty of wheat to be harvested in any of his post-Zep work, yet not one entire album was a complete tour-de-force.  That, IMHO, has now changed.<br /><br />Band of Joy is the mature Robert Plant rising up with all of his influences to create a synergistic whole that can stand with anything he has ever done.  It stands with my favorite single Led Zeppelin albums those being the aforementioned I thru IV.  Like with Zeppelin it took a special group of musicians to create a sum greater than the parts.  Band of Joy is unequivocally that whole that propels Plant's vision and talents to rarified air.  Not only is every song on the album momentous, but if you've seen them live they absolutely can take, it would seem, any other artists stellar songs and propel them further.  Plus, in concert they always take a couple of Zep songs and re-imagine them in a completely new form that almost births a new experience.<br /><br />Buy this album if you thought \\"Raising Sang\\" was his reemergence as a musical force because this album has more earthy grit that electrifies his artistic gifts more.  One can only hope that this band has more to give in the future.  Even if they don't (I thought Emmylou's Spyboy would last) we have  this spectacular musical journey in which we all can truly be absorbed into.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could because this has made me into a Robert Plant fan at the tender age of 51!  I want to say that it isn't only due to Plant, he was blessed to get the perfect foils in Band of Joy.  A true musical treasure that is also a huge sonic treat as it is recorded quite well.  I've never heard such bending of low-e strings ( in my life) complimented with mandolin, steel guitar, acoustic guitar, and banjo.<br /><br />I'll shut up, I'm sure you get my message:  buy this album and be taken to a place no other music today can take you..

0805211063|5.0|As Walter Benjamin indicates, Kafka's ouvre is the testament of our time. What we really needed was an attorney to litigate the absurd madness the direction of our civilization has taken. Kafka gave us that.<br />Now, let's set the record straight. There are a number of reviews here that partake in this madness. To understand Kafka, one must have shed real tears, and not only for oneself. Afficianados of Ayn Rand take note. The Castle is a masterpiece, perhaps even greater than The Trial (imo - yes), and one of the magisterial achievements in prose fiction. The terminal unfinished conversation, breaking off mid-sentence is ... perfection. The seal of the unanimous approval of destiny. What more needed to be said? The endless rondo of futility must continue unto death. A losing battle, initiated by an obscure mistake ... but we must fight on through the slough of materiality, pettiness, and despair until the end. What more appropriate condemnation?<br />Further, Harmon's translation is vastly superior to that of the Muirs. Be aware of this fact. Harmon's translations are the BEST. In time, I doubt whether the Muir translations will be read by any but scholars, the uneducated, or the unfortunate.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I waited so long to read this book (after reading all the other Fae series). This book was very confusing to me, having to go back and re-read. In this book, Karen Moning uses the F word way too much for my liking. Call me old fashion if you will. Then I had to really think about what kind of person would write a book like this??? I just found it to be more \\"way out there\\" than the other books I read.

0553801473|2.0|Let's start with the BIG problem--the book doesn't really pick up until around page 562...which is the end of a chapter. And by \\"pick up\\" I mean \\"the endless repetition stops, and events actually start HAPPENING.\\"<br /><br />It's as if there are two books which have been jammed between two covers. There's the first book, in which GRRM proves that he can write a travelogue just as tedious as the notorious camping trip from Hell in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Everyone is walking or sailing somewhere, the weather is bad, no one has any money or any men, and there are no end of scenes mentioning every food and beverage available. Oh, and pissing. Can't forget the pissing. GRRM never does.<br /><br />The first half of ADwD also includes a lot of scenes which appeared in the previous book from another character's point of view. This can be used to great effect if the two characters in the scene are seeing what's happening in two completely different lights. However, in this case, there is little difference. GRRM has effectively just C & P'd \\"Alaric said\\" in place of \\"Bob said.\\"<br /><br />And speaking of Bob--Dragons is crammed with \\"As you know, Bob\\" dialogue and narrative. Davos' and Daenerys' chapters are particularly bad; oftentimes I felt as if I was at a review site, reading a recap of the four previous books. The last chapter summarizes Dany's entire history, even though it's been mentioned at least seven or eight times prior to this. Tyrion's story, too, gets recapped. Oh, and we're reminded a few billion times that Tyrion killed his father. Just in case we forgot or anything.<br /><br />Catchphrases, too, are over-fondled. These show up frequently:<br /><br />\\"Where do whores go?\\" (Tyrion's chapters.)<br /><br />\\"Reek, Reek, it rhymes with [rhyming word].\\" (Reek's chapters.)<br /><br />\\"The night is dark and full of terrors.\\" (Jon's chapters and Melisandre's chapter.)  The ritual of R'hollr's nightfires, copied and pasted in its entirety ad nauseam, sounds dramatic at first, but it gets repeated so often that it starts to sound silly. Barring lands with midnight suns, most nights aren't known for being light.<br /><br />And then there's the second book, which starts two-thirds of the way in and in which all the questions that people have been asking for years start getting answered very fast. Some fairly key scenes get skipped over, too.<br /><br />Also, practically every \\"answer\\" scene ends on a cliffhanger, or what's intended to be a cliffhanger. They could not scream, \\"You'll have to buy the next book to find out what happens!\\" any louder.<br /><br />I've been going through everything with a mental red pen. At least 90% of the first 500 pages could have been cut down to a manageable size--from several chapters to one chapter, from one chapter to a paragraph or two.<br /><br />There are also a fair number of inconsistencies. Before, the silent sisters were described as the equivalent of contemplative nuns who take a vow of eternal silence. In this book, we're overtly told that a father saying to an eleven-year-old girl, \\"I'll give you to the silent sisters and then you'll never speak again\\" means that he was telling his daughter that she'd have her tongue cut out. Greyscale was one word before--now it's \\"grey scale.\\" Before it was an illness that killed some children in the cradle and disfigured others, like Stannis Baratheon's daughter, Shireen. Now it's the Westeros-and-Free-Cities equivalent of leprosy, a disease which slowly transforms people into stone--such an illness does exist in the real world, but I think that Martin was just trying to come up with something that fit Shireen's scars. In fact, greyscale, or grey scale, is now so feared that one sufferer dares not reveal his illness lest his friends turn against him and even those who have the scars are shunned. It was stated before that Tywin Lannister's father, Tytos, so extravagantly wasted the Lannister fortune on a string of whores as to leave Tywinwith a hatred for prostitutes and a horror of being laughed at; now Tytos had one mistress that he treated like a wife. And so on. Martin may be trying for unreliable narration, but frankly, it doesn't come off that way.<br /><br />Now, do I have anything good to say about this book? Yes. I do like the answers to questions, cliffhangers or no; some are extremely satisfying. Martin's depiction of mutilation, torture and the resultant Stockholm syndrome was exceedingly well done. It was horrifying and unpleasant to read, but it was portrayed with painful, all-too-believable clarity. Jon Snow, my all-time least favorite character, improves dramatically.  I enjoyed most of the chapters with female characters, especially Arya's. Once Martin finally gets going, he tells the story pretty well.<br /><br />But this isn't enough to outweigh the problems. Not nearly enough.<br /><br />If I could, I would give it 1.5 stars. It doesn't really merit two.
0060936223|5.0|This is both an autobiography and biography in one. It is a riveting accounting of the years before Mapplethorpe and Patti became stars. It is a story about beauty and art and the creative process as it existed for this incredibly talented duo. While I thought an artist was defined as someone who could create things the rest of us couldn't, Patti and Robert believed the defining characteristic of an artist was that he or she could see things others didn't. Their ability to perceive the world in a different and unique way was what made them ultimately successful, admired (or reviled) artists as much as it was their ability to translate those visions into works of art. I couldn't put this book down and having finished it, I can't stop thinking about it.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book was very well written. I picked it up every spare chance I got. The Author really captured my interest. What I didn't like was 1) the editing in this book was not great. I find it SO distracting when there are spelling errors in a book I am reading. Takes me out of the story at that moment and it's annoying. At one point the word was supposed to say \\"when\\" and it was typed \\"one\\"...  and 2)  The male lead in this book is domestic violence waiting to happen. It doesn't give the YA readers a real take on what love should be. I don't want to give away what happens so I won't say more.  All in all Jamies good writing and story telling won me over, I am going to get her other books for sure!

0811879542|5.0|My kids (4 and 5 1/2) LOVE this book - they take it so seriously, and you can see the wonder in reading it, it's more like an activity than reading a book - definitely recommended for age 3-5, and fun for adults to read with kids, so clever and creative.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Had promise but took to long to get interesting. AND, the twist wasn't that great either. I wouldn't suggest paying for this book. get it from the library!

B004Y1USJE|3.0|I've always loved Yes. Grew up in the 70s idolizing the band, especially Steve Howe, and even enjoyed the later Drama phase, minus Anderson, in its own way. In fact, I've bought every Yes album released and still enjoy many of them from time to time. The period from 'The Yes Album' to 'Going for the One' remains my favorite, but I've found something to like on every album since. Listening to a new Yes album, especially back in their prime, was often both exhilarating and challenging, with repeated listens necessary for the beautifully complex musical forms to fully bloom and engage. That was the hidden joy of progressive music and half the fun. What a rush.<br /><br />But times change. If I'd never heard of the current band, I'd say that the music's certainly more interesting and accomplished than most contemporary rock hitting the waves. And there's some solid musicianship here, too, especially Steve's acoustic work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when compared to some of the other progressive (symphonic) rock coming out these days, especially from northern Europe, this release sounds surprisingly simplistic and tame to me. A few listens and time to move on. In contrast, the Flower Kings' most recent ('Sum of No Evil') is just one example of current prog-rock that both maintains and expands the genre in fresh, inspiring, even challenging ways. For me, sadly, 'Fly From Here' doesn't even come close.<br /><br />I wish the guys well, though, and expect that they'll find an audience to connect with their current offering. After all, with 40-odd years of Yes in all its varieties, Yes fans differ greatly. 'Fly From Here' is a recording that seems sure to highlight those differences. The good news for classic-prog fans like me is that other contemporary groups, like the Kings, are stepping up to fill the void. Head over to the 'progarchives' site and such to check out some great options that, IMO, far exceed 'FFH's' ability to tug at the beautiful memories of Yes' golden progressive era.<br /><br />But we're all Yes fans here, aren't we? I guess in the end it's just a matter of discovering what Yes means to each of us and choosing Yes music accordingly. Not a bad legacy at all for a band that has given so many of us such great joy through the years.
B000002H97|4.0|That Metallica are one of the greatest heavy metal bands in musical history cannot be disputed. Both commercially and musically, let alone the combination of these factors, it is diffcult to find another band with similarly heavy sound which has ever been as successfull as Metallica. Too bad that they ceased to exist in the early 1990s.    During the 1980s Metallica produced one very promising debut which would have been completely forgotten today had it not been followed by three supreme masterpieces. Then came the Black Album and the beginning of a profound change which was to become more and more repulsive with the passing years. The results were very decent and listenable albums such as ''Load'' and ''Reload'', which are no Metallica however, unsuccessful experiments such as ''S & M'', and some pure junk such as ''St Anger'' - which is hardly music, let alone Metallica. Significantly, the band's best album during the post-1991 period was a collection of covers and old gems (''Garage Inc.'').    Now the problem with the Black Album is not that it is conspicuously light and commercially mind-blowing. I am pretty sure that Metallica never sold themselves out, in other words they never compromised their artistic integrity for bigger sales. They never needed it: even in the 1980s they were one of the hottest tickets and one the bigest sellers in the genre. I am sure that the tendency that started with the Black Album, and later degenerated much further, was a natural and sincere one. And in the very beginning it did produce an album almost as fine as the classics from the 1980s.    Some of the lightest songs in the album - I understand the special term is ''mainstream'' - also happen to be some of the best ones, and they do demonstrate, not so much musical growth, but certainly a greatly expanded musical versatility. The great popularity of ''Nothing Else Matters'' and ''The Unforgiven'' is also their curse: it often prevents us from fully appreciating them. In the company of masterpieces, without hesitation I would put ''Enter Sandman'', ''Sad but True'' and ''Wherever I May Roam'' as well. Both the music and the lyrics are top-notch.     The problem with the Black Album is that it is very uneven, much more so than any of the previous ones (including ''Ride the Lightening'' which is by far the most uneven of these). Half of it is terrific, quite on par with, if different than, anything Metallica had produced before (see the previous paragraph). But the other half is consistently weaker. Even though there is not a single ''bad'' song here, few of them (''Holier than Thou'', ''Through the Never'', ''My Friend of Misery'') might have remained unreleased without any loss for world of music. The rest of the album, though containing fine pieces like ''Don't Tread on Me'', ''The Struggle Within'' and ''Of Wolf and Man'', is not quite on par with the five aforementined songs. To me they have always sounded somewhat laboured, monotonous and uninspired.    So what is the bottom line? Well, there is absolutely nothing epic about the Black Album, nothing like 'One' or 'Master of Puppets'' are you likely to encounter here. But this is a very poor reason for degrading the album. It may be distinctly light and it may be more simplified that the epic opuses from the 1980s - indeed it is both - but it also shows that Metallica can be as creative and profound on this more commercial and lightweight plane as they always have been on the more (or less?) rarefied one which they occupied during the 1980s.     One star down not for any other reason, but simply because the album can easily be split into two halves, one of them distinctly inferior to the other. Yet could anybody in 1991 have predicted what would happen in the next years?    P.S. Is it a coincidence that the Black Album, unlike the previous three ones, does not contain an instrumental? Hardly.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  The beginning was really good, but then the momentum just dropped off.  I found the journal entries to be boring & there was too much talking about her animals.  I was surprised that the book did not contain any coverage of the trial.    I do admire Jaycee for telling her story and trying to help others.  Definitely not worth the money for the read!!
B005869U6G|4.0|I must say that the first time I listened to album, I did not like it at all.  I felt like it was all about Brandon's voice and didn't even sound like Incubus anymore.  I listened to it again.  I felt the same way.  The third listen through I started to dig it a bit.    Incubus is the only band to ever do this to me, and they've done it twice.  I also disliked Make Yourself when it first came out.  I was a huge fan of S.C.I.E.N.C.E., and Make Yourself was so much lighter and really caught me off guard.  After a few listens I realized it's brilliance, and I came to love it.    This is by far Incubus' lightest album.  Other than the ending of The Original, and most of Adolescents, nothing else would be considered anything close to \\"heavy.\\" But don't see that as negative, it just happens to be where they are right now.  And after a few listens, the layers and grooves of the music really start to shine.  The musicianship on this album really is fantastic, but it's so different from anything else they've released that it really does take some time to digest.    All I can say is, give it a few listens.  Even if you hate it, make yourself (hehe) give it a couple more chances.  I know if I hadn't I never would have gotten to appreciate what I truly feel is yet another fantastic Incubus album.

Songs are good (most are sexy), but if you're wanting more of the \\"old\\" Miley, you're looking in the wrong place. This is the new Miley. And I personally think she's amazing.

The adventure features hidden curses left by lost American Indian tribes, hungry and deadly nanobots, Jefferson's coded letters, and connections to Mormon philosophy. Of course we have Painter Crowe, Pierce and Seichan to help save the world. Classic adventure and very entertaining even if the ending was a little melodramatic.

0446892882|5.0|I read this book decades ago. It is an amazing read, very well written. I just bought it for a friend. I bought an older copy as there are before and after photos of the author after he kicked the sugar habit on the back cover. He doesn't even look like the same person at all. In fact you'd never even recognize him. He goes into the history of the use of sugar over the past centuries up to the present and hoe it is implicated in so many health problems. Highly recommended.
B004DMIIO6|3.0|Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- \\"For straight-up sensory overload, not much is going to eclipse the craziness of Goemon. Before I continue, fair warning: If CGI leaves you cold, steer clear. Like 300, Goemon is virtually all computer-generated, featuring actors with their prop swords (in most cases) standing in front of green screens delivering their lines. In fact, there were more than a few occasions that it felt like I was simply watching an extended cut-scene for a Japanese role-playing game on the PS3. I am on record as someone who has become ambivalent towards CGI overuse, especially with regards to action scenes, but I'll give Goemon a pass; from the outset we're in a hyper-stylized world and realism isn't a commodity. My two biggest problems stem from the substance and the style: 1) the film is not a brisk two hours, its myriad sub-plots, character arcs and exposition chunks slowing the momentum down far too much and, 2) the potentially coolest action moments were nearly impossible to see. I could handle a sagging pace--and the middle act of Goedon is glacial--if the action pay-off was ample, but mostly I was squinting just to decipher the over-the-top computer renderings. For example, there's a huge scene toward the end as Goemon scales a tower to square off with the evil lord and he has bound through ascending levels, defeating ninjas and dodging cannon fire. Nifty in theory but almost impossible to follow thanks to the overwhelming busy-ness and hyperactive edits that were stuffed in. Not that the Blu-ray wasn't trying, because the 2.35:1 transfer (1080p, MPEG-4 AVC) is a strong performer. The resolution provides an eyeful, which can be bittersweet: there is some seriously gorgeous effects to gawk at, but the enhanced clarity also pull the rug out from underneath some laughable visual effects. Two engrossing Dolby TrueHD audio tracks: Japanese 6.1 and English 6.1 (go with the original for the extra channel and the lack of dubbing) are included. The disc is rounded out by an hour's worth of behind-the-scenes content, showcasing how the film was staged and the effects were incorporated.\\"sc is rounded out by an hour's worth of behind-the-scenes content, showcasing how the film was staged and the effects were incorporated.\\"
0439023521|5.0|I heard so much about the books and the upcoming movie(s), so I thought I'd give it a shot. I must say that the books are incredible, with the best being this first one, The Hunger Games. I know that the intended audience is Young Adults, but at 33, I really enjoyed the books. I would highly recommend.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|It's hard for me to give a star rating to this book. My heart goes out to Jaycee Dugard and I can't imagine going through and surviving all the things she had to go through.    I watched the ABC Special on Jaycee and I didn't think I learned that much more from her book than I did watching the show. A large section of the book is dedicated to journal entries which are somewhat interesting, but not that important I don't think. I expected to read more about her time there, but years go by without being brought up and most of the time I wasn't sure how old she was, or her girls.    It's hard to rate it because I think it was just ok and if I give 3 stars I don't want that to reflect the content of the story because I think she's brave for opening up and writing about her experience, I just don't particularly enjoy HOW she wrote the book.
0439023491|5.0|Although not quite as good as The Hunger Games, Catching Fire is still an excellent read. It is my second favorite of the series with Mockingjay being the third. I love the introduction of new characters who will play incredibly important roles in the remainder of the series, especially two of my favorites, Finnick Odair and Johanna Mason. I would definitely highly recommend.
B002E2M3KM|2.0|Great music ruined by awful sound...another sad victim of the \\"loudness wars\\". They sucked all of the dynamic ranged out of this thing to make the CD loud and then simply dumped it to vinyl. My original pressing sounds light years better than this in spite of its age. Avoid.
0439023513|4.0|I loved the first two books, but I agree that this one felt like something was missing. I had already been captured by the other two books, so I overlooked most of it, but it simply wasn't as good as the others. It was as if the characters that we were accustomed to no longer consistently displayed the attributes and personalities to the fullest extent.     It is still a decent read, and you have to read it after reading the first two books. I really did like some parts of it, but I agree with most people that certain parts were not well done.

B004P9FAK2|5.0|Half-Blood Prince may be my favorite of the series, and the Ultimate edition continue to live up to the quality of releases Warner has been putting out for the series. If you don't have the previous 5 releases, there's little reason to buy it, but all are highly recommended.
0553801473|2.0|I only stumbled onto this series because of the HBO series.  And I devoured the first four books in about a week and a half, at the same time re-reading the Black Company series from the beginning even as I was in the middle of She is the Darkness. To say I like this particular genre would be an understatement.<br /><br />I fell in love with the series.  And that's been rare and rarer occurrence in recent years.  Truth be told, in fantasy genre, there are a lot of trash out there.  But when you love the genre, you wade through them in hopes of finding something like this series.  Even with the good books, after so many of them in so many years, they don't touch you as the early ones once did.  But this one certainly did.  I cannot even remember being as horrified and actually ANGRY at the villains as I was when I was reading through the Red Wedding.  When you're as jaded as I conceit myself to be, that's a treat indeed.<br /><br />So this book was a huge disappointment.  In fact, this seems another Wheel of Time in the making.  At the risk of sounding snobbish, that's not a compliment.  Maybe the author doesn't mind.  Churning books is lucrative, and as people invest in characters, they forgive much and dutifully buy the next installment.  but if you can't tell a story in about three books (the LotR standard), maybe you shouldn't write. (I know, the Black Company is like 7 books long but the change of POV narrator keeps the books pretty fresh)<br /><br />This book goes nowhere in particular, stews like the thin broth the starving masses (and there are many in this book) huddle around, and dissolves into a cliffhanger that actually gives no suspense.<br /><br />Bear with me for a sec.  Parents who prep the young ones for daycare in the morning may be familiar with an educational PBS program called Between the Lions.  One of the skits is a crudely animated short called \\"Cliffhanger\\" where a mountaineer perpetually hangs from a stunted tree limp on a cliff.  Each episode, he contrives a way to be rescued and in the end, he still ends up hanging from the cliff.  The music concludes, \\"Cliiiif hanger, hanging from the cliff.  That's why he's named... Cliff Hanger!\\"<br /><br />That's this book.<br /><br />However, I will grant the maps in the beginning of the book are drawn much nicer.<br /><br />I'll finish this series, no doubt.  And it can be redeemed with the resolution in the next book.  But I finish all my series, even the foul, unreadable ones. (see my Ed Greenwood book review)

B0015DROBO|5.0|The first 15% (Kindle version) was a little slow.  I skimmed a lot of pages and was starting to regret buying it.  I'm glad I didn't give up.  It ended up being a very good read.  I just downloaded the second book in the trilogy and am looking forward to starting it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is the best book you'll read this summer. Scratch that. This year. Abby and Travis are REAL! Not vampires, werewolves, or dragons. They go to school, fight, have sex, drink, hell even smoke cigarettes! (Gross I know). Abby thinks like a normal girl and I love the part were she takes control of her sexuality and protects herself! BIRTH CONTROL! Get girl! Travis is sexy, emotional, covered in tats, likes to party,  but will do anything to protect Abby...even from himself. Love it. Of Course you have everyone else. The friends who fight for them and the people who will try and keep them apart. It's a gorgeous story! Just read the book and when you get done you'll love it just has much as I do!<br /><br />There is also a discussion you can join and hopefully Jamie will notice**, about whether or not there will be books about the brothers! One can hope right?!?!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I hesitated to read this one because of the reviews, but I'm glad i did.  It's not as riveting as the first two, but it's a fitting conclusion to the trilogy in my opinion.

0553801473|4.0|I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews. It's not great but it borders on being very good. There are lots of mini cliffhangers throughout the book - but an observant reader will be able to figure out which ones are faux and which are actually important.<br /><br />Things I thought were great - at last there is some Bran. The early scenes with Tyrion were very well written. The new characters he runs into were decently done. Most of the chapters were set in the North (always my favorite part of Westeros)and were so good I couldn't put it down. Martin really goes into the many rammifications of the Red Wedding - even into secondary characters like the Boltons and the Manderleys - in ways that I didn't expect and that I enjoyed reading.<br /><br />Theres a couple of Martell chapters, also some others. set in Kings Landing - all pretty good. Plus Asha and Melisandre have some good POV chapters.<br /><br />Things I didn't like so much - the scenes with Daenerys (but then she was never one of my favorite characters - so to me - no loss), some of the cliffhangers were completely unneccessary and run the risk of Martin jumping the shark by overusing this technique - in trying to replicate what he achieved earlier with Lord Eddard's death and the Red Wedding. If you are a reader for whom this would jump out at you - I could see some disappointment. Plus there could have been more Bran, Meera and Jojen.<br /><br />Overall - it's really good. New and well written fantasy is hard to find. I'm glad George Martin continued this story and I'm interested in how he will further it in the next volume. Very good job.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce has out done her self with this album! This album is definitely a \\"4\\"!!! The favorites on the album are: 1+1, Party, Countdown, Start Over, I Was Here, and Run the World. B's voice has grown into a mature sound and she took risk on this album that definitely paid off. Beyonce you scored HUGE with this album Great job!!!
B0053F042G|4.0|Lots of action and adventure, a little hard to figure out in the beginning (by design I think), and then leaves things open for interpretation and a sequel at the end!
1419364375|5.0|I was listenning to the audio version of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" as the first book of the author Jodi Picoult. The Audio consists of 5x voices with right rithm and intonation. It creates the a great affect of the story which hold me tight for few commute rides.
0553801473|4.0|The story is clearly back on a singular track, which given the muddle mess of Feast for Crows, was a real question. But the storylines are all ended with cliffhangers and there's little resolution in any real sense. Still, the story is taut and a worthy read.
1594744769|5.0|Do you remember when you were a child and you came upon one of those books that just seemed magical to you? Something about them drew you in and wouldn't quite let you go, even after the last page was read. Being well over 30 I don't often stumble upon such reads, but I remember the magic, and when I picked up Ransom Rigg's book, intrigued by the title and the photos, I once again got to experience that magic that only a good book can bring. The story is beautifully told in the voice of teenager Jacob, who has grown up being told tales by his grandfather Abe, tales that he used to believe, about a home of peculiar children with special abilities - like being superstrong, invisible and able to fly. Being now a teenager, Jacob has come to accept his grandfather's stories as tall tales, but then something happens that changes everything and forces Jacob to once again reassess the truth. Mixed in with this story are the photos (genuine vintage photos the author has found and borrowed) depicting one peculiar thing after another, and this really adds to the story's magic, making you feel like you are looking through someone's old photoalbum. The whole edition is beautifully made with 3 coloured inlay and a lovely setting, it certainly is a collector's item if you are in to beautiful books. The only negative is that I want more NOW - the book does not answer everything and there is hopefully a sequel in the making. I, for one, can't wait to immerse myself in Mr Rigg's magical world again!
B0058P7KUA|2.0|It has a lot of fun game play and a halfway decent story line for just a time waster, but for some reason the lives don't register. On numerous occasions, the 1-ups you pick up don't count for some reason which is really frustrating on some of the harder to beat levels.

0553801473|4.0|Well now, this book has generated some serious emotions on the love/hate Martin train. The honest truth is that you can only get worked up if you really care, and that is the whole point.<br />Martin creates a world that the reader becomes attached to and storylines that demand resolutions. This newest installation is ponderously large and there is a feeling at times that the story is not moving forward due to the majority being parallel to the previous novel.<br /><br />****** YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK AS AFFC PART2 ***********<br /><br />Do that and you'll be super happy. No matter what anyone says... Martin write one hell of a story.

B0051OZ564|3.0|This was my first Zach Snyder film. The visual special effects belong on the big screen. The metaphorical comparisons between the brothel, asylum, and Baby Doll's fantasy worlds just never connected, even through Sweet Pea attempted to explain it.      I am very happy I didn't waste my money going to the theatre to see it. The plot was just too thin. The action sequences are visually stunning. I feel robbed that Snyder never showed us the `dance' It works for dinner and movie with friends

0007250916|4.0|Dr. Mukherjee's book might be described as a history of people either getting cancer or trying to do something about it.  Most of the book focuses on events since the late 1800s.  Because cancers usually occurs in later life, in earlier times many people had already died before they reached the age at which they might contract cancer.   Thus, there are few references to cancer in ancient medical works and few obvious instances of cancers in human remains from those times.  From about the European middle ages there are more references to cancer; but the only obvious way to deal with some cancers, by surgery, would often be worse than the disease because of the use of unsterilized tools and rarity of anesthesia for the patients.    Beginning in the late 1800s surgery became a practical option as asceptic techniques and anesthesia was available. This allowed for the beginning of decades of slow progress in treating cancer, marred by frequent misunderstandings of the nature of the disease and by the obsessional and excessive application of whatever techniques were at hand.  The obsessional and excessive response to cancer became quickly evident when William Halsted, an American surgeon, came up with the radical mastectomy in order to deal with breast cancer.  This surgery, which removed much other tissue, such as lymph nodes, besides the breast, was either overkill for those breast cancers which could be dealt with by surgery, or alternatively was insufficient for cancers which had already metasticized.  Halsted's belief that cancer would spread in a step by step progression from the breast to the near lymph nodes, and then on to the next lymph nodes, was incorrect; cancer can spread from the breast to a distant location.  Unfortunately, the clearest evidence that he was mistaken had wait about a century, until 1980, when the results of a randomized trial were released.    Sidney Farber in Boston could be considered the originator of chemotherapy for cancer.  He focusedon leukemia because it was the one cancer at the time (just after the Second World War) whose spread or remission could be measured quantitatively.  His discovery of chemotherapy agents followed an empirical approach with little underlying explanation of the nature of cancer.  Working with the philanthropist Mary Lasker, he obtained first large private funding for cancer research, and then a great increase in public funding in the Nixon administration.  By then Farber's approach, focused on empirical screening of chemicals for anti-cancer activity, had already been institutionalized at the National Cancer Institute in the form of a large program systematically screening chemicals for their effectiveness as chemotherapeutic agents. These agents tended to be chemicals that stopped cell division, as rapid cell division is a hallmark of cancers.  However, many normal tissues also have cells dividing regularly, so traditional chemotherapeutic agents are hard on the patient too; the hope is that you kill the cancer before the patient gives out. Just as the nature of cancer drove Halsted to come up with radical mastectomy, so too would traditional chemotherapies eventually be applied by frustrated clincians in extreme and unhelpful therapies in the late 1980s and early 1990s.    Only slowly did knowledge of the basic biology of cancer improve.  Some environmental causes of cancer, such as exposure to excessive radiation, had been known.  In the 1950s the ability of tobacco smoke to cause cancer was first strongly indicated, but without an understanding of the biology.  For some decades after World War Two the idea that viruses caused many human cancers took hold.  The result was another screening program at the National Cancer Institute, this time to find viruses that caused human cancers. Ultimately, the idea that viruses directly cause cancers has been found to be greatly overblown, thanks to our increased understanding of genetics and DNA.  Cancers require genetic changes that allow for unbridled cell division.  As viruses require a cell and its associated genetic machinery to reproduce, they sometimes accidentally incorporate a human cancer gene in their own virus genome and spread it.  Other viruses can cause cancers by modifying the genes involved in cell division.  But viruses don't seem to cause most human cancers.    Although all cancers involve cell division, cancers are not all alike.  Cancer cells sometimes retain the characteristics of the tissues from which they orginate.  For example, some breast cancers require estrogen to grow; since the 1960s, these cancers have been treatable with tamoxifen, a chemical which blocks estrogen from the cancer cells.      Our greatly improved knowledge of DNA is leading to more targeted cancer therapies with fewer side effects.  Now that some of the specific genes involved in cancers are known, cancers can sometimes be stopped using chemicals that stop these particular genes from working.  Since the late 1990s, therapies of this sort have become available.  They will probably never be a complete fix, as cancer cells evolve in response to chemical therapies just as bacteria evolve resistance to particular antibiotics. Still, the new therapies, and the use of screening techniques such as Pap smears that can sometimes detect a cancer before it develops much, suggest that improved outcomes for cancer treatment are likely.  Given the history of the field, we should not expect dramatic improvements or a complete cure, but things seem to be looking up nonetheless.

0062060554|5.0|Before I Go to Sleep is a thriller you won't be able to put down.  Even as you think you have it all figured out, there is a twist that forces you to reconsider what you know.  I was constantly thinking I knew how it was going to end, but each time new information would negate my theories.  It is not the kind of thriller you can't read at night ala Stephen King's novels, but it compels you to keep reading.  You just want to know the secret of Christine's past, hidden by her by amnesia.  In addition to it being a thrill ride, the plot of the novel itself...an amnesiac whose memories are erased each time she goes to sleep...gets you thinking about the meaning of friendship, family, and love.  Highly recommended, quick, easy read that will not disappoint.  Just be sure you have time to read it, because once you start, you won't want to stop!
B004Y1USV2|3.0|I'll keep this brief and short now that I have listened to the entire CD.<br /><br />Unfortunately Benoit David will be compared as the replacement singer to Jon Anderson, and in doing so this album suffers.  Clearly he is mediocre.  I can only Imagine what Jon would have injected into this.  Most of these tunes are credited to Horn and Downes and that had me concerned.  I don't think the Title track is strong enough.  Bumpy Ride comes close a bit but so far it's not carrying me away.  I'm still going to give it a chance to sink in more and give an updated review.<br /><br />Update 8/26.<br /><br />My feeling much the same on the Track Fly From Here.  I think they took a mediocre song and generally developed an old idea.  Apart from the Howe Material, it seems bled to death
B004WOS7LO|5.0|I am thrilled that David Cook's sophomore CD has finally been released and I am absolutely loving it.  My top favorites currently are \\"4 Letter Word\\", \\"We Believe\\", \\"Rapid Eye Movement\\", and \\"The Last Goodbye\\". Overall I think it's a great CD.  David's voice, which I was drawn to like a magnet the first time I heard it on the radio (I never watched American Idol), is amazing...it can be so smooth and turn so raw...love that!!  He hits a range of notes and does it so well.      I love how the CD seems to tell a story that flows from song to song.  The band members do an outstanding job; Neal NEVER disappoints with his outstanding guitar playing...a major reason to see these guys perform live; Kyle never missing a beat on the drums (would have loved to hear a drum solo...maybe in the next CD?); Monty playing bass...esp. \\"Circadiun\\"...WOW; and Andy, a great talent on guitar and piano!  Love the added piano, violins, choir, and orchestra.      David truly is an accomplished singer, songwriter, musician, and live performer.    Now when is that tour schedule going to be posted??  Am looking forward to seeing these guys and hearing all of these great songs live!
B004EPYZP8|1.0|Matthew McConaughty is the wrong actor for the lead in this movie.  Matt is too cute and too cool and does not fit the character from the book. Someone like a young Joseph Mantagnia (?)would have been perfect.  He can act as well which is something Matt struggles with.  It did help to have a strong cast just had the wrong Mickey.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|So moving and inspirational... I urge everyone to purchase this book.    What surprised me the most is the voice feels 100 percent that of Jaycee's... in so many memoirs you know a ghostwriter is actually writing the story and that's clearly not the case here. It's simply Jaycee's story of a life that was indeed stolen from her by a very sick man and the woman who enabled him. I hope someday she is able to truly regain her life, free from hounding from the media. She's an extraordinary person who deserves a chance at happiness after all she has endured. I don't think you could read this and not wish her and her girls all the best in life.    I hope that this book continues to be a huge bestseller and Jaycee is able to use the earnings for the benefit of her and her girls and her beloved animals. Among other things stolen from her were an education and the chance to develop a career.

0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl was, as he put it, \\"a professor in two fields, but a survivor of four camps - concentration camps, that is\\". Already a renowned psychotherapist, Frankl's experiences at Auschwitz and other concentration camps provided him profound and striking insights into human psychology. He sets them out in this brief and elegant book.<br /><br />Firstly, when put in a situation of extreme adversity or deprivation human personalities do not blur into one \\"uniform expression of the unstilled urge\\", as Sigmund Freud had supposed they would but, on the contrary, true personalities are accentuated. Secondly, despair and depression are not at all correlated with the experience of adversity, but if anything inversely so: in our modern, plentiful and comfortable times, neuroses are legion. By contrast, on the whole they weren't in Nazi death camps. Frankl was uniquely placed and qualified to comment on this; Freud was not: \\"Thank heaven,\\" Frankl remarks dryly, \\"Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside\\".<br /><br />This seems right: I dare say you don't see much neuroticism in modern day Somalia either (though I do quite like the idea of obsessive-compulsive Mogadishan parents pushing their kids into extra cello lessons.)<br /><br />Frankl uses his anecdotal observations to propose what was in its day a revolutionary psychology: it isn't our primal physical urges which determine our behaviour, with intellectual constructions being mere epiphenomenal by-products (Freud would have it that love, for example, was a spin-off of the deeper primal sexual urge), but the other way round: it is the intellectual content - the *meaning* of our lives that shapes and drives our behaviour and, crucially, our happiness.<br /><br />The more profound and compelling you find the meaning in your own life, the less neurotic you're likely to be.<br /><br />This leaves open the question of what \\"meaning\\" might be, and what might make a profound and compelling one. This question Frankl doesn't answer, rightly I think, other in rather an airy fashion. Anecdotally, meanings are more likely to count as profound and compelling the more gravely connected with the \\"tragic triad\\" of pain, guilt and death they are (no shortage, therefore, at Auschwitz). But beyond those axes, the implication will be that we, the users, determine our own meaning.<br /><br />This may perhaps be a little self-fulfilling, and neurosis may be a product of existential frustration (in other words the confounding of one's own quest for meaning through preoccupation with things you don't truly value): Frankl cites a senior American diplomat who sought treatment from depression arising from discontent with his working life. Frankl's advice was not undergo psychotherapy, but to change his job to something he cared more about!<br /><br />But all the same this seems to me a plausible explanation for modern melancholy: who, these days, isn't continually and forcibly preoccupied with things he or she doesn't truly value? That seems to perfectly capture the \\"asset rich, time poor\\" existence.<br /><br />This is a short book, but it's a gem: the message of plurality and self-determination are ones which should strike harmonious chords in the ears of those, like this reviewer, who are nudging into middle age and wondering if it is quite all what it cracked up to be.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonly I think, other in rather an airy fashion.

0553801473|3.0|In the long, long years between ASoS and AFFC, GRRM wrote that he was having trouble figuring out how to solve what he termed the \\"Meereenese knot,\\" AKA the Daenerys storyline. A mess of characters were supposed to be converging on Daenerys in Meereen, but timing issues in the story were making it impossible for him to figure out how to pace the storyline to make it all work. His solution to the Meereenese knot? Do nothing about it at all. Only one character who was supposed to arrive in Meereen and meet Daenerys does so by the end of ADwD. Furthermore, after hundreds of pages devoted to the city, Meereen is no better off at the end of ADwD than it was at the beginning. Absolutely nothing happens that could not have been resolved in 100 pages or less. Daenerys only had a few chapters per book in the first three books, but she managed to achieve more character development in those books than she does in nearly a dozen chapters in this one. What was the point of the Hizdahr marriage? Do we need so many pages devoted to her holding court or debating whether or not to open the fighting pits?<br /><br />GRRM is starting to veer dangerously into George Lucas territory here. He must needs find a better editor, and soon. Someone who is comfortable telling him when his language has moved from \\"verbose but fascinating\\" into \\"ridiculously long-winded and meandering.\\" Do we need to hear a detailed description of every single bite of food every single character happens to eat or see? I know GRRM is a rotund man, but it's getting to be silly. And how many times can one author write about how the juices (or the grease) run down a character's chin (or their beard, or their entire face, or their leg?) Seriously...we get it. People in Westeros eat with the fervor and fine motor skills of a two year old encountering ice cream for the first time.<br /><br />It's mind-boggling to think about how much story was packed into the first three books compared to how little is packed into the last two. Almost no one's plot has advanced even the smallest amount since ASoS. Only Jon's story has seen significant movement, and...well...<br /><br />Where this book goes right (Lord Manderly baking the Freys into pies and then eating them! \\"The North remembers.\\" Arya's first official assassination! Sympathy for Theon! The fall of Cersei! '\\"Ghost,\\" he whispered.'), it goes very right. Where it's wrong, it's simply boring and superfluous. It's not that he's ruined the story, he just isn't DOING much with it.

I was also confused in the beginning as to if they were there because she was a germaphobe or if they were captured.    I was a little disappointed in the ending because I felt like it just left you hanging.  How did they recover? Did they fully recover?  There were a lot of unanswered questions.
1451629184|5.0|The human spirit can persevere to survive horrifying experiences, and if this was ever evident it was in the life that Jaycee Dugard was forced to live. The details she has shared must have taken great courage to put down on paper. Jaycee Dugard teaches anyone that reads this book that you can overcome any adversity in life if you understand that you do what you have to do to survive. To have survived in the \\"backyard\\" all those years, and to be so strong, intelligent, and creative is absolutely amazing. The story is sad, horrifying, and inspiring, but most of all hopeful. Because after reading the book, I've got to believe that if you have HOPE, life always has meaning.
1400079144|1.0|I couldn't finish this book.  I got ¾ of the way through and decided to just put it down.  Dan Brown is now following the exact same method for each of his novels.  I doubt they will even make this into a movie it is so poorly written.  Same old same old super strong fanatical bad guy.  Same old same old characters rushing around trying to solve puzzles in the last few moments.  In all honesty I wish I never bought this book.  Don't waist your money.

B004QXJZXA|5.0|I and many others have written about the movie itself, but I'll just say a few words about the new BluRay DVD I just received yesterday.    Simpley put: well worth the money but a couple of odd results to mention.    For a very long time the only copy of this movie I had was a VHS tape I got off a cable channel that had used a horrible print. But I was one of few in country with a copy since no retail VHS was available.    Then, after several years of lawyers fighting, a VHS tape came out and I immediately buought it. But, sadly, it was still not great but better than the one I had. Then, after several more years a DVD came out and I bought it not that long ago (in comparison) and it was much better, especially using an upconverter DVD player and an HD tv.     With that said, I was very happy right off the bat with the BluRay. How one can tell is easy and done within the 1st minute or so when watching the intro section of the movie where McQueen drives his 911 to the track. This has always, photogenically/technically, been lackluster and always looked   \\"soft\\". Much, much better now but still looks a bit soft in sections compared to modern films.    I have come to the conclusion that the film crew/director were pushing the limits of film/light and as a result there is a fair amount of what we called back in the 60s/70s in the photo business \\"grain\\".  Some scenes suffer more than others. They'll be a slightly soft scene followed by a much better, sharper scene, like when he's thinking back on the crash the previous year. But BluRay really is great on close up pit and racing scenes and now a viewer can see the wrinkles in the side number \\"circles\\" on McQueen's 917.    Also, this was first time I played LeMans after installing a fiber optic audio cable in my soundbar. Great! Fiber optic cable is worth the money.  I got a GE one for $16.00 bucks at WalMart. Radio Shack wanted $39 for one.    The odd result with BluRay. The sky shimmers in the prerace scenes. Almost looks like rain. The sky is grainy and BluRay makes it stand out. But only really noticable in early scenes where there's a lot of sky. It looks like they were filming with an overcast and low light conditions. Remember, this is a film using 60s technology.    It is worth the not-so-cheap (as my wife said) cost. My wife also knows I own a DVD of the movie (as well as Grand Prix which I also ordered in BluRay).

1451629184|2.0|......about reading this book.  Diane Sawyer described it as being 'very graphic' and I wondered if every pedophile in America would purchase it as a hand book.  After two family memebers read it and described it as 'difficult but interesting,' I decided to give it a go ahead.  While I applaud Jaycee and her inner strength and ability to forgive and move forward with her life, I wish she would have partnered with someone (her Mom?) to make this book more interesting. I would have liked some kind of time line reference to what was happening to the other people around her life.  Sadly, its not one that I would refer to other people.  I would tell them to watch the Diane Sawyer interview....or read the People magazine archives if they want to learn more about Jaycee Dugard.

B0015AARJI|1.0|Don't buy a PS3 controller from NorAm International Partners, Inc.  They are selling fake controllers.  You can tell it's fake if the buttons seem a little off, the home button and the LED lights at the top are a little recessed, and if you have difficulty syncing the controller to your PS3.  By difficulty, I mean that it takes 30 seconds or more to sync and flashes all four lights for this time.  Also, if your controller is plugged in when you shut your ps3 down, your controller will continue to blink and will actually restart your ps3, meaning you have you manually turn it off or unplug the controller.  Finally, the sticker on the back of the controller is missing most of the specs other controllers have on them.  Wish I would have read their feedback profile before I bought it, as this is not the first time someone noticed it was fake.  Don't buy from them, you'll regret it

B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Nev Schulman is a professional photographer in NYC who one day is contact via Facebook by a young girl from Michigan named Abby.  Abby is an aspiring artist, and she has made a painting from one of Nev's photos that was published in a national paper.  From this one painting (not a great painting, but darn good for an 8-year old)...Nev & Abby begin an online friendship, the results in many more paintings coming Nev's way, several phone conversations with Abby's mom and ultimately, an online romance with Abby's older sister Megan.    Via Facebook, texting and sporadic phone conversations, Nev discovers that Abby is becoming a commercially viable artist (he's excited that his paintings by Abby may be worth a pretty penny) and that he's falling in love with Megan.    Nev makes a surprise journey to Michigan to finally meet Megan and her family in person.  What he finds there is far from what he expected and is quite surprising and even disturbing to him.    What makes CATFISH an unusual viewing experience is that it is (seemingly) a documentary.  Nev is a real person, as are his filmmaker roommates:  his brother Ariel and their friend Henry Joost.  When the paintings by Abby start arriving, Nev is cajoled into letting these two guys document his emerging online relationships.    Nev makes a charming subject.  He's handsome, smart and charming.  He's clearly exciting by his new love affair.  And when suspicions that all is not as it seems begin to set in, we root for Nev.    I'm not telling you what they find in Michigan, because that's the big surprise of the film.  And it's also the big quandary in trying to evaluate this film.  If this is a 100% true, unmanipulated documentary, it serves as a chilling, funny and sometimes touching exploration of the dangers of online relationships and the ways modern society allows individuals to be things they aren't and represent themselves in manners different from reality.    But by pointing out how easy it is to manipulate folksthrough careful selection and manipulation (such as when a documentarian edits a film a certain way and chooses what footage to show and what to leave out)...we can't help but have a feeling at some level that CATFISH is a put-on.  It clearly isn't a complete fake...but have events been staged?  Has it been so edited as to not really represent a reasonable version of the truth?  I know philosophers say that the very act of recording an event changes it...but CATFISH is an outstanding illustration of this.    In brief, this \\"true\\" story is almost too good, too dramatic to be true.  We asked to believe that all this manipulation of the truth is merely being observed and that the filmmakers aren't manipulating it themselves.      That being said, these mind-bending quandaries make CATFISH a lot of fun.  It's a hoot wrestling with trying to figure out just what these people have in mind.  Nev seems like just a nice guy...but sometimes his observations are just so perfect, they feel scripted.  Ariel and Henry seem to ask Nev to do and say things for the benefit of their film, and not because he wants to do or say them.  And the folks in Michigan are a very colorful cast of characters, to say the least.    A sense of sadness permeates the film.  It's sad to think how Nev falls in love with a girl he's never met, when he lives in NYC, a city with a few \\"real\\" single women.  And the truth in Michigan is sad (I wish I could say more).      CATFISH is a fascinating curiosity.  It stimulates the intellect more than emotions.  If what I've described above sounds intriguing...by all means take a look.  If it sounds only like 90 minutes of east coast artiste navel-gazing...you will probably have your feelings validated.  In some ways, the far superior EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP explores some similar territory, but for me, CATFISH was still well worth a look.
0756405890|5.0|Name of the Wind is one of the best books you will ever read. A well told plot with colorful interludes, this story is told in a unique way that will capture your attention. In this novel Rothfuss displays a talent for writing rivalled only by authors such as Robert Jordan, Jim Butcher, Rob Thurman, and Tolkien. If you haven't got this book then your collection isn't complete. And once you read it you will have no choice but get the second one as well. The world Rothfuss creates is too colorful to put down, and if this series doesn't have at least five books by the end then the world of fantasy will be taking a great blow. IF you are any kind of fantasy fan you will have this book.
0756405890|5.0|As a fan of the Harry Potter novels, to compare Rothfuss' work to the same is a disservice, as these novels are not only singularly creative in magic and worldbuilding, but they are powerfully strong in character and pure beauty of language.

030746363X|4.0|I checked out \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" from the library, having done the same months ago with \\"The 4-Hour Workweek,\\" so I knew to expect Ferriss's overcharged style. As a journalist myself, I've had hundreds of readers take issue with my articles, using comments like \\"why didn't you test with THIS?\\" or \\"how could you have possibly mixed up X with Y?\\" Such people seem so obsessive about displaying their superiority with minutiae that they completely miss the point of the story and fail to derive the help and knowledge I was trying to convey. I see that same sentiment riddled throughout these \\"4-Hour Body\\" comments. Come on, people, grow up. You want to argue about whether a female orgasm happens in the advertised 15 minutes versus 20? Or the fine points of glycemic conversion? Or how many angels can dance on the handle of a kettleball? The POINT is whether or not Ferriss sets you on the path to desired results. And for me, he did.  By happy coincidence, my months-long hold request for \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" came in right when a copy of Dr. Michael Eades's \\"The 6-Week Cure for the Middle-Aged Middle\\" also fell into my hands. The two authors came from very different directions and ended up saying much the same thing. I'm 40 years old, spawned from a gene pool that looks like a toxic vat of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. When I read these books a month ago, I weighed 234 pounds (at 6' 0\\") and had blood work bad enough that my doctor wanted to prescribe statins.  I implemented the Ferriss diet plan on June 20th and deviated only slightly from it. For example, I got some plain, nonfat yogurt to mix with a few blueberries as a snack. Eades doesn't seem to object to dairy and low-sugar fruit in the same way that Ferriss does, so I went for a middle point between the two authors. Also siding with Eades, I went cold turkey on all caffeine and alcohol, figuring that if I was going to experience carb withdrawal (which I did for 2-3 days), why not throw caffeine on the fire, too? Butthe punchline is this: After 21 days on the plan, I had my blood drawn and analyzed. With effectively zero exercise, here is what happened:  1. Weight: 234 before, 221.5 after .. 12.5 lb. loss  2. Blood pressure: 132/83 before (averaged from many tests over weeks), 121/71 after [I have *never* had a reading this low in the past three years of measuring  3. Glucose: 93 before, 87 after  4. Total cholesterol: 192 before, 153 after  5. Triglycerides (the most important measurement to me): 228 high, 106 after  I had expected some improvement. I knew that statins (Lipitor, etc.) average a 15% drop in cholesterol and 20% drop in triglycerides (see [...]) after *many months* of use. But nothing had prepared me for the massive drop caused by this diet change -- a change that has me eating 3-4 whole eggs plus bacon plus other meats every day and heaping my plate with vegetables at every meal. The hunger that pervades calorie counting doesn't exist here.  Weight loss is fine, but THIS...this was a new lease on life. This meant that by turning my back on the mass-produced, over-marketed, sugar-and-carb extravaganza that comprises the modern American diet, I just might be free from the decades of torture I've seen my parents and grandparents endure.  I'll visit my doctor in a few days to get more details on my blood work, and I'm very curious to examine LDL and uric acid levels. (Some people caution that a high-protein diet can spike uric acid, which in turn can lead to gout.) But back to my original point, do I care if Ferriss is off on a few points? Heck, I don't care if he's off on 80% of his points. My job as an attentive reader is to identify the 20% of information that is most valuable and pertinent to my life and apply it for maximum benefit. As Ferriss advises, I did that here, then corroborated that 20% against outside reading from trusted authorities, and the results speak for themselves.  UPDATE: On December 14th, I crossed the line and hit my goal of losing 40 pounds. This was with weekly cheat days...OK, and maybe several extra cheat days thrown in along the way. Blood tests showed that my uric acid is slightly elevated, but otherwise everything looks very healthy. Since December, I've maintained at a 40-pound loss. I could probably stand to lose another 10 to 15 pounds, and I expect it will take a decrease in dairy and/or sucralose consumption as well as an increase in exercise to make this happen. Still, the modified Ferriss plan was sufficient to get me where I wanted to go on its own.

B004H8GLXQ|3.0|This is one of those books that I read months ago and now that I think about it, it goes down as not so remember-able.  I want to say it was but in truth I just can not.<br /><br />This book attracted me one because I knew it had to do with a book. Two, because of the dark secrets surrounding the family. The mystery seemed very V.C. Andrews like which is an author I use to love but have grown out of.  I thought I would enjoy it much more then I did but the dark secret wasn't that secret.  The book hinted a great deal what was to come before it did so the ending was no real surprise.<br /><br />I agree with many that it is confusing which time period this book takes place.  It does hop back and forth from past to present which makes it all the more conflicting.<br /><br />This is the first book I read from Barnes and Noble recommends list and I think I can see why they picked it.  It has a certain style about it.  I suppose if you never read any V.C. Andrews the ending might be surprising but to me it was not.  I just wasn't impressed with the plot.  I was intrigued at first but then quickly got bored.  Really wanted to like this book more.

B004U52VPS|5.0|My 7 year old loves Angry Birds. He has the stuffed animals, the shirts, and now, the real life game. This was a present he received on his birthday and it definitely is a favorite. He plays it all the time and brings it out every time he has a friend over. He is able to set up all the pieces they way they are shown on the card, and i would think that kids even a few years younger could do it too. The cards show you exactly what you have to do, they're very straight forward. No, the birds do not explode or split into the mini birds but he loves it all the same. It's very cool to play the game as an App, but its awesome being able to do it in real life. I highly recommend this for all kids(maybe even some adults) who love angry birds. Would definitely buy again, and have recommended to others.

B00005MNP8|5.0|`Parallel Lines' is now one of those mythic albums, cited as one of the best of all time by many a critic and punter, so much so that it has become an `establishment' record along the lines of Fleetwood Mac's `Rumours', Bruce Springsteen's `Born to Run' or Radiohead's `OK Computer (none of which, obviously, it resembles!). Part of the legend has also become the way in which Australian producer, Mike Chapman (Suzi Quatro, The Sweet, Nick Gilder) stepped into the production shoes, taking over from Richard Gottehrer (`[[ASIN:B00005MNP5 Blondie]]', `[[ASIN:B00005MNP9 Plastic Letters]]') to crack the whip and make Blondie muscle up and produce a real record.<br /><br />In reality, though he may have disciplined them behind the scenes, the magic of Chapman's production is that his approach gave them only a slightly slicker, more commercial sound. The real achievement is that he allowed this record to sound like a natural progression from `Plastic Letters', released the year before (which was a marked step up from their debut), and recorded a band that still sounded exactly like themselves - like Blondie. Granted, `Heart of Glass' (it is the glossier `disco version' here, which replaced the first version on the original pressing of `Parallel Lines' a short time after its release) and to a lesser extent, Chris Stein's sickly pure pop confection, `Sunday Girl', interrupt the album's stylistic flow. But even the first two Blondie records showed a formative predilection for genre hopping.<br /><br />Unlike the first two albums, there is no real filler here and all band members, save drummer Clem Burke, contribute to song-writing. Lyrically witty, it features some of the band's most beautiful lines and turns of phrase. It opens intoxicatingly with the short punk onslaught of Jack Lee's `Hanging on the Telephone' and later features another similar composition of his, `Will Anything Happen'. Both of these tracks completely compliment the style in which the band wrote for the album. Despite the well known hits, some of the very best songs and highest points on the record were not singles. Chris Stein's hauntingly slow and dirgey `Fade Away and Radiate' is utterly stunning, as is Jimmy Destri's mod pop rocker, '11:59'. Along with `Picture This', it is the closest thing to the style of the first two discs. `Pretty Baby' (Harry/Stein) is another hypnotic, 60s styled new wave moment. `One Way or Another' and `I Know But I Don't Know' ensure the playful tongue-in-cheek quotient that the band had already established is not missing. The closest thing to a weak point is the somewhat superfluous Buddy Holly cover, `I'm Gonna Love You Too'.<br /><br />`Parallel Lines' is their most famous record, but despite its reputation, it doesn't mean the band were never able to eclipse it They would with 'Eat to the Beat' the following year. This 2001 remaster sounds excellent but the 4 bonus tracks again don't add anything (particularly the terrible live version of T-Rex's `Get It On').m.

B000UJ48VI|5.0|Vladimir Nabokov knew this when he penned the novel; Stanley Kubrick did as well when he directed the film. His version is the original masterpiece, and over the years, its message continues to creep into the psyche and haunt many a virtuous soul. Stellar performances from James Mason, Peter Sellars, Shelley Winters, and of course, Sue Lyons. Kubrick leaves no stone unturned as he pushes the limits of love, lust, loneliness, uncontrollable desire, justice, and murder. Buy it. It's a classic.

159420229X|4.0|I think many of the other reviewers described quite well what the book is about. What I'd like to add is for the comments that he does not talk about the 'how' to develop your memory skills in the book. This is absolutely false. While it is not a practice book he does indeed talk about how he practiced, what techniques he used and what others do for the memory championships. If you are looking for a book on how to practice then get a Tony Buzan book, but if you want to read an interesting journey into practicing and learning about people who do mnemonics then this is a great book.<br /> The other part of the book that I found fascinating are the portions he talks about Savants, and amnesiacs. I wish he'd go into a bit more details about it. Especially about Daniel Tammet's skills and why did he only get to fourth place in the memory championships if he is a savant. That makes no sense to me, and I'd like more insight into that. whether Daniel is a savant or a mnemonic practitioner he's still done some amazing feats.

B004MYDW5A|1.0|Not exactly a review of the product itself (it's a review of listing problems for this item), but I don't know where else to put a note like this.<br /><br />Just a heads up that this is not the only listing of the book and there have been some listings marked higher than those on the other Clash of Kings hardcover entries. Trying to see if Amazon will get rid of this listing since it's basically a dual listing that only allows buyers to purchase from individual sellers rather than through Amazon, for those trying to take advantage of the free shipping. If this entry is still coming up towards the top of the search, the other can be found by limiting the search criteria in the left for hardcover after you enter the title, or by using the ISBN.

B004SGWYW4|2.0|Okay, so my friend was raving about how great this anime is. So I decided to check it out.<br />Well, let me say something first, it's misnamed. It should be called \\"High School of the Boobs\\" because they take up more of the anime than the zombies. I literally had to watch each episode twice just because the boobs were UNREASONABLY bouncy, and incredibly distracting.<br />Pros:<br />-Great animation<br />-(2 or 3) likable characters<br />-They actually did  pretty good job predicting how people would act in a zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Boobs that have the consistency of yogurt mixed with water<br />-WAY to much fan-service. Too much to ignore at least.<br /><br />It's true that there are more pros than cons, but the cons are bad enough to ruin the anime. The only real reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the very few pros.<br />If you like anime's with watery-yogurt-in-plastic-bag like boobs that take up a good 50% of the screen time then this the anime for you. But if you like paying attention to the plot then definitely don't watch this anime.
0061122416|5.0|This book is simple, so yes, the critics have a point.  But I also found it interesting and inspiring.  Santiago is a young shepherd boy on a journey to reach his dreams.  Along the way he has to leave his family and loved ones to seek the desires of his heart.  He meets people that have forgotten their dreams or forgone their dream to lead a more practical life.  One person, the crystal shop owner, is afraid of fulfilling his dreams because he doesn't know what will be left of him if he accomplishes such a feat.<br /><br />Don't we all face the fear of our dreams?  That's why this book has become a best seller.  The truths are universal.  This exchange was eye opening for me:<br /><br />\\"My heart is a traitor,\\" the boy said to the alchemist,  . . \\"It doesn't want me to go on.\\"<br />.... \\"Naturally it's afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you've won.\\"<br /><br />I've been that person afraid to move forward for fear of what I'd leave behind.  So, if you can relate to that - read this book.  You will be renewed and inspired to seek your dreams.
B0000524EM|5.0|This box set includes the Collector's Editions of 3 dvds from The Crow film series: The Crow, The Crow: City Of Angles & The Crow: Salvation. Before buying this, I hadn't seen any of the films. I got it because most people I knew compared the original to Dark City & the original 1989 Batman, 2 other favorites of mine & since they didn't have the original dvd alone, I had to get the boxed set. I'll start with the worst & work my way up to the best.<br /><br />I have not seen the last 2 films so I'm basing what I say on memory.<br /><br />Salvation - This movie was the worst (before the Wicked Prayer film) of the series. It stars Eric Manibus (or however you spell his last name lol who was Riley in Buffy) as Alex Corvis & Kirsten Dunst of Spiderman 1-3 fame. Unlike the other films I've seen, Alex Corvis is the only one who dis not have face paint on. He's framed for murder & because he was wrongfully accused for Lauren's (Alex's girlfriend) death, the mysterious crow brings him back to avenge her death who happens to be the sister of Dunst's character. Some of the music is quite enjoyable: The music heard while Alex visits the grave & where the statue has a tear of blood (this is at the cemetery at night where Alex first sees his girlfriend;s sister but disappears when she calls her dad, screaming that there's someone there), the music at the end where the final dialogue is heard (right before the end credits hit). They are on the score soundtrack as appears as: Alex Visits Lauren's Grave, Slo-Mo Walking, Love Theme - Ending. Listen to these 3 tracks.<br /><br />City Of Angels - This one while better than Salvation & Wicked Prayer still does not hold a candle to the original. Here, Vincent Perez stars in the lead role. Vincent's character is Ashe Corven, who's killed along with Danny, his son. Sarah from the original flm returns, older & played by another actor (Mia Kirshner). Corven is resurrected (which is witnessed by Sarah herself) & along with the guidance of thecrow & Sarah, he seeks vengeance on the criminals to murdered him & his son. Sarah paints his face & he gets black colored clothing & a motorcycle. After killing off the minions one by one, he returns to his grave so he can rest in peace.<br /><br />The Original Crow - THE BEST of the series & one of the BEST films in my lifetime & in the history of films. The late, great, ahead of his time, Brandon Lee gave a performance second to none & I cannot find the words to describe his portrayal. He was totally dedicated to this film. It was his BEST performance & this film made his career, which ended prematurely thanks to a tragic accident on set during the making of the film. I will not go into detail about it because it saddens me too much to do so & people who read this likely already know what happened. Everything about this film is really just magnificently amazing! And that's putting it mildly! The entire cast were great & fit the roles better than anyone I know. But the MVP is & always will be IMO Brandon Lee. It's tragic yet at the same time ironic that the film in which the lead character, Eric Draven dies & is also the film which was supposed to lead Brandon Lee to superstardom, perhaps beyond that the film I believe he was most dedicated to, is also the film where he passed during the making of it. In the film, Eric returns after his death. Too bad Brandon can't.<br /><br />Note: The Skull Cowboy is a character that does not appear in the film. But he was intended to & you can see him for a second or two in an extended version of a scene. You'll find out which one eventually. He witnesses Eric's resurrection or does the resurrecting. I'm not sure. But he's just there to explain certain things to Eric such as why he's come back, what his mission is. Also, he explains to Eric that he lost a portion of his powers because he went off mission for a time to talk Darla into being a mom again to Sarah & quit using morphine cause it's bad. In the extended edition of the Funboy scene, he stabs Eric, who screams. THe reason for that is Cowboy's explanation for Eric losing some power<br /><br />DVD Extras: Deleted footage montage (excellent bgm), Extended scenes, Making-Of Featurette (I love these kinds of extras. It's why I buy DVD's. This was a great one! Wish all the main cast members & crew were present for this. But it wasn't to be), and finally, Brandon Lee's very last interview (that was also on The Crow vhs).<br /><br />If you can find the dvd of the original alone & you should be able to, get it cause the movie & extras are definitely worth multiple viewings & I also recommend the score more than the soundtrack although the soundtrack does have some great songs on it. Both fit the film well especially the tracks that appear in the film. I thought they were heard in the movie at the right times & places. I don't know but I prefer the DVD's audio over the bluray. But the bluray has better picture quality & that is the reason I have both versions.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Dark City is one of my most favorite films. I had the original dvd & still do that I keep it storage as a collector's item. But the Bluray is well worth the price! It has all the special features the dvd has & then some! And includes both the director's & theatrical cuts!<br /><br />I had to watch the film many times to truly understand it. It's mystery/sci-fi thriller flick. It stars Jennifer Connely (as Emma), Kiefer Sutherland (the Doctor who is with The Strangers but later turns on them), Rufus Sewell (as John Murdock, the lead character role), William Hurt (as the cop) & Richard O' Brien who stile the show for me as he brilliantly played the role of the main Stranger who's seen in the film the most, Mr. Hand. The Strangers are an ancient race. As heard in the theatrical cut, their civilization was in decline so they came to our world to seek a cure for their mortal existence. They have this ability called tuning which they use to move around the city that they built based on stolen memories. They want to find out what makes people human so they conduct experiment & switch around people's memories. One day you could be a doctor. The next day, a cop and so forth. John woke up during the middle of an experiment so it was interrupted rather than be completed. Therefore he's left with fragments of memories & sets out to find out who he is. Shell Beach always comes up in every flashback he has so he tries to find out where it is & how to get there.<br /><br />Memorable scenes for me: the beginning scene along with the main titles sequence, The Strangers arriving to get John who escapes, Mr. Hand questioning the whereabouts of John before putting the man to sleep, John's first encounter & fight with The Strangers with saw Mr. Quick's death, Mr. Hand & the doctor (who is in the pool) discussing John, among other scenes.<br /><br />I was totally sold on this film upon seeing the theatrical trailer that I saw in theaters when I went to see the second Mortal Kombat film back in 97. The movie sucked except for the opening scene (minss Johnny Cage's death) but the Dark City trailer, which was better than the MK film itself, was well worth the price alone! It was that good! Watch it on youtube or on the dvd/bluray of you have it! The score music compsoed by Trever Jones is also good so I highly recommend the soundtrack as well!<br /><br />To put it simply, GET IT, WATCH IT (BOTH VERSIONS, I SUGGEST THEATRICAL FIRST) & LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK MULTIPLE TIMES CAUSE THEY'RE WORTH IT!

My wife and I like to have some fun with Grover's voice and play up the tension as we approach the end of the book, and though I'm sure my daughter doesn't really understand the irony of the book yet, she enjoys listening to us being foolish and appreciates Grover's concerted efforts to end the story early.  I'm always pleased whenever this book appears on my lap and never tire of reading this one.

0143038419|3.0|I came to the book via the movie, having seen the movie so many times that I felt I ought to read the book.  I can see why the producers of the film made the decisions they did and why the movie is so different than the book--different, but no less entertaining.  But this is about the BOOK.<br /><br />\\"Eat Pray Love\\" was mostly entertaining, somewhat informative, and by degrees uplifting and irritating; I looked forward to reading it every day, and as a result (against my better judgement) I ordered a copy of the sequel.  I've developed a habit, when I'm into a good read, of looking back to the cover, to the author's picture, as if that will give me any insight as to what's going on.  Elizabeth Gilbert is odd then, in that I could never match her face with the prose.  I went to the internet and saw other pictures, I still couldn't match the face to the character in the book.  Don't know why.  In any case, the book is a monologue, a long-winded, almost stream-of-consciousness monologue that is all about Elizabeth and how Elizabeth can't seem to get a grip on herself.  She cries, she screams, she's a mess, and what the movie doesn't tell you, she's on anti-depressants, although, she doesn't like the idea and won't stay on them any longer than she has to--which is about half way through Italy.  Still, Elizabeth The Annoying Wreck (who would have driven people out of the theater in droves) has some very impressive moments of contact with the divine, and therein is where I found my connections with her, and thus her story.  As annoying as she is, whiney-whiney-whiney--she at least doesn't give up, she fights on, and she does it on various levels, from travel to spiritualism, and when necessary, prescription drugs.<br /><br />Some of the book reads like a self-help manual, with fluffy and often not necessarily well researched conclusions, like a reference to a New York Times article about Tibetan monks hooked to a machine while they meditated, and the machine seeing theirbrains go from the normal red/yellow/orange levels of activity, to a cool blue that coalesces into a \\"blue pearl\\".  Go to the internet and look up that meditation study, and you can see the same brain scans and there is no all-blue brain, let alone a blue pearl, just a blue-center brain with bright fringes.  Close, but would you really want to make policy based on this, and then take it on the road where Fox news is going to rip you apart?  Accuracy may not be as much fun, but it builds credibility.<br /><br />And then, after four intense months in an Indian ashram, where she really came in contact with what ailed her, and made her whole, she flies to Bali, and one short plane ride later arrives worried that she won't be able to find her old friend Ketut, the medicine man.  Wouldn't the Universe take care of that?  This is a woman who meditated herself to a stormy beach for a lesson with a dead Yogi, and later was swept away (in meditation) to a brief moment in the palm of God's hand.  Didn't anything stick?<br /><br />Yet, as I thought, the Indian part of the book was my favorite, where the Indian part of the movie has become the part I most often skip over.  The movie is far more visual, and that part doesn't serve the camera as well as it's content carries and enlivens the book.<br /><br />One thing I didn't expect, and which I found quite pleasant every time she did it, was her way of bringing brief but detailed histories of places, activities, rituals or words into the narrative.  One moment she's approaching \\"air head blonde\\" in a really bad way, and the next minute she's telling you something you really ought to know, but that other writers wouldn't find germaine to the story and would skip, as a result.<br /><br />This book will not be for everybody.  Many--as the customer reviews attest--will find it all self centered whining and babble, and that is understandable.  But for those who have their own issues with getting themselves under control and are always looking for ideas, this is more entertaining than a run of the mill self help manual, and may well show you that some people are even a bigger mess than you are.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is one great show.  It is engaging and all characters are flawless in their performance.  I can only watch this series on DVDs because it is such a great show that if I watched the series weekly I would not be able to contain myself if I had to wait to see the next episode.  I know it's a bummer to wait it out so long but to be able to watch as many episodes as I want without commercial interruption is worth it. Yep, it's that good.  If you haven't already, get season one and two and curl up on the sofa and treat yourself to some fine TV.

While I may never be able to take all the tenets to heart, there is a weath of information here that may lead many to a much healthier lifestyle.  Even my partial attempts have gained me some better outcomes. I'd highly recommend this book, for knowledge if nothing else. I had only marginal knowldege of what the book was about, but was very intrigued to hear more about dietary changes for good health.  This has been a quest for some time now. One more piece of the puzzle.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Yes, the title was a bit corny but no matter. I walked into Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 thinking it was going to be like Part 1- Slow and uneventful- I soon found that I was wrong. I was sitting in the theater shushing people if they spoke and telling people to put their phones away when they popped out around me. I loved this film a lot. The action and special effects were just great. The score was just so beautiful that I was dumbfounded by it. And the emotion... oh my God. The emotion in this movie is so great that it compells you to choke up. And then there was that scene from the book, (Minor spoiler here) The Prince's Tale with Severus Snape, that made me choke up a bit. Alan Rickman stole the show. He was just so great with Snape in this movie. Thank you David Yates and Cast for this wonderful gift you have given to my generation. I will be sure to pass it along. Note to Academy: Get that nomination ready. After 1o years of denying Harry Potter it MUST change. Oscar attention must be paid...    EDIT: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 will be released on 2 disc Blu-Ray and DVD on November 11, 2011. The Box set including all 8 films and a 4 disc Blu-Ray version will be released on November 30, 2011.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I'm not sure if I'm more disgusted with Philip & Nancy or the MEDIA. This poor girl and her daughters have been held prisoner long enough - LEAVE THEM ALONE! Let them live and enjoy their lives in peace. The media is holding them prisoners in their home, afraid to go out anywhere for fear of being exploited. They are manipulating just like Philip did. Shame on all of you!   If I see or hear of any media agency reporting on what they've eaten for lunch or where they're camping for the weekend, I swear I'll never watch/read another thing from them again.    Anyway, I purchased this ebook for my kindle mainly because I wanted to do something to support Jaycee & her girls as well as the JAYC foundation. I had $19 left to my name... and wanted to share it with her so badly.     I thought I had a feel for the story already from what I've read online and have seen on TV... I was WRONG! You truly can not get a grasp until you read the entire story.. It really explains a lot.  Jaycee is an amazing woman with unbelievable strength and courage. I wish everyone would take the time to read this book and support her cause. I'm rarely left speechless... but after reading this, I just don't know what to say... there's so much, my brain is overloaded! My jaw is still on the floor.    I hope that Jaycee, girls & family continue to get the much needed help, therapy and support that they need. I'm so glad she's discovering herself and trying to catch up on things she was robbed of. I hope the laws toughen up on sex offenders in the future so we can prevent these things from happening in the first place.

0062060554|5.0|This novel had me turning the page. I don't think I put it down until the last word was read. The ending however was a little too much, a little too far fetched maybe. However, I enjoyed the whole story.I loved it.    Erika Garza
0553801473|5.0|INTRODUCTION: As I mentioned in other posts, there are only two authors that I regard as iconic in fantasy and one of them is George Martin since before A Game of Thrones appeared - and especially before it started taking off in the late 90's, early 00's - I found very little genre fantasy to read. I am not a Tolkien, Feist, D&D, Jordan, Erikson, etc fan since I prefer my fantasy to be with little magic and closer to historical fiction - my main problem with magic is that it suffers from the \\"works at one clock, but not at two a clock\\" syndrome as well as the authors rarely exploring the implications on societal evolution of having unambiguous, \\"I can kick it\\" proof of mind's ability to influence matter directly, not through technology and science.<br /><br />Before AGoT, I knew about Mr. Martin from his awesome Sandkings novella which was one of the defining texts of my childhood that made me a lifelong sf fan, so intrigued by the blurb I bought AGoT on release and never looked back, while thinking, that, \\"yes, this is the fantasy I want to read\\". On the other hand I do not tend to agonize over unfinished series and I read the books as they come, so after A Feast for Crows and the rereads of the earlier three books in 2005, I kind of forgot about ASoIaF until this year's superb TV series put me back in a Westeros mood and I've reread the four earlier books.<br /><br />So very, very high expectations for A Dance with Dragons and after the first two reads, I have to say that the book while not perfect and quite transitional and expanding the story-lines rather than starting to pull them together as one would expect in a fifth out of seventh series novel, delivered more than enough to be my top fantasy of the year so far.<br /><br />In the following I will try to avoid major spoilers for the novel itself, though there will be of course major ones for the series up to AFFC and as befitting a novel of such huge scope with action taking place in many locales, lots of characters, etc, the \\"review\\" will be more of a collection of impressions and highlights, as well as some of the stuff I thought worked less well. As usual, whatever counts as spoiler for a person may not count as such for me, so if you have not read A Dance with Dragons so far, read what follows at your peril!<br /><br />OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: The first thing that surprised me when reading A Dance with Dragons is that the book does not have the \\"each word counts\\" finished feel I expected after the very public six year struggle of the author with it; for the first 600 pages I felt like almost nothing happens as the big picture goes, just going back and forth to mark the time until the timeline gets to the end of A Feast for Crows and things can start happening; when things start to happen, yes the action is mostly awesome, but there is some silliness too.<br /><br />Now, \\"almost nothing happens\\" would be an indictment for many authors since it would mean bloated verbosity, but in GRRM's case, the world building, the character dialogue and the nuggets of action that we see are more than enough to make the pages turn by themselves and keep one absorbed.<br /><br />Yes, not all story-lines are equally absorbing and for me the North alternates between very interesting when we see the actions of various Northern lords, most notably the Boltons and lord Manderly in the new circumstances, while Stannis prepares to assert his rule and confront his enemies and the more boring parts of Jon trying to be \\"humane\\" and integrate the starving, fleeing wildlings with their historical enemies, the Night Watch whose commander he happens to be. Never a big favorite of mine, I have to say that \\"Lord Snow\\"'s arc is one of the best realized in the book and it will be a highlight for many.<br /><br />Or Tyrion's wanderings where maybe because of him being still in shock after the dramatic events of A Storm of Swords, he is far from the sharp operator we got to know and love and seems more like acomic relief persona thrown there to be blown away on the wind by whatever current is stronger at the moment. This was the part I was looking forward the most and maybe because of that, it was the most disappointing thread of the novel.<br /><br />The other main story of the novel, Daenerys' rule of Meereen is quite interesting though, even if it is not what what is generally assumed that happens in fantasy - where the destined one comes, conquers, snaps his/her fingers and all live happily ever after. No, here we see \\"reality\\": conquering with a strong army and better weapons is easy, but holding on what you conquer is very hard and requires sacrifices; this point of \\"is it worth to conquer hoping to give people a better life, only to realize that most want the lives they led before and having peace may mean compromising all you hold dear?\\" that we see repeated throughout history up to the present, is one that GRRM keeps making and as mentioned above there is no \\"out of jail card\\". I found this thread excellent and very realistic though I am sure that people wanting traditional fantasy will hate it the most.<br /><br />Daenerys' peregrination and decisions were simple so far - she acted true to her principles and despite hardships she has won - but now that she decided to actually rule, she faces two equally unheroic choices: bath Meereen in the blood of her enemies, including the hostages from her entourage that she came to like, or compromise with the slavers and their allies and allow a more relaxed form of what came before. And the way this dilemma plays through the book was to me one of the highlights of the novel; without easy choices, the author's handling of it was as good as possible within the constraints.<br /><br />Interspersed with these three main stories, there are a lot of other characters stories and those mostly work well, but here and there I was wondering at the structure of the novel and how quite a few of those (Bran and Cersei's chapters forexample and maybe even Arya's) could have easily been included in A Feast for Crows since they are tangential to this book, while leaving space for expanding the intrinsic stories of A Dance with Dragons and sparing us the \\"unfinished feel\\" we get in the end, feel which the author clearly indicated was due for lack of space.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons is not short on great lines and there are quite a few scenes that hold with the best to date in the series but I will leave that for everyone to discover them. For myself, besides the obvious ones, Cersei's arc was quite memorable for example especially still having clear in mind Lena Hadley's arrogant but great performance of the queen in the TV series...<br /><br />As for characters, for me the best one - in the heroic fantasy mode - was Ser Barristan who has several POV chapters and he is given ample scope to show why he is so famous after all. The most disappointing one was Tyrion as mentioned above.<br /><br />Now for the things that worked less well - I think that Mr. Martin's decision to split the story geographically rather than chronologically was misguided and A Dance with Dragons shows it since until the timeline catches with AFFC, nothing major we do not know about can happen and this - what I call the prequel's bane - makes those first 600 pages or so much slower than the rousing finale.<br /><br />The wrap up to most stories is another issue - here the culprit is the page count which basically forced the author to postpone lots of events to the next book - so there is a feel of incompleteness and while it bothers me less than others, I think that will be easily seen as the major shortcoming of the novel. The good news is that once The Winds of Winter will be out, this aspect will be forgotten, the bad news is that we have no idea when that book will be out...<br /><br />And here we come to the last thing of concern, namely that at the current pace, I have a hard time seeing it finished in two more volumes, even of 1000 pages like this one. Now that is not a bad thing since I am happy to read at length about the wonderful characters of GRRM and their world, but one thing I hope is that the author will not try again to be over ambitious and stick with a \\"I said seven, seven must be\\" plan and then realize he simply does not have the space to tell all the stories he wants, the way he wants. When in a fifth out presumably seventh book and in 1000 pages+, the story and characters expand, sometimes quite a lot, rather than starting to get together, this is something one has to mention.<br /><br />Overall I think that if you are an obsessive fan who discusses the finest points of the series in great detail in various forums, the book will be acceptable but not totally awesome for the reasons mentioned above, but if you love a grand scale epic series where the author keeps his \\"action have consequences and there is no get out the jail card\\" stance that so shocked people including myself in the earlier volumes, A Dance with Dragons (A++) will be the one novel you want to read this year indeed!<br /><br />Note; this review has been published first on Fantasy Book Critic and all links and references are to be found there
B002KKCWD6|5.0|I was looking for a comfortable sandal that didn't have a strap between my toes.I found that this sandal is very comfortable and has contours that match a regular shoe. I highly recommend this pair of sandals.
1600108512|5.0|I just picked up my copy and I can say that I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.I've always loved  the 80's movie.Seeing Peter S. Beagle's work through other artists creativity is inspiring!
B003Y5H53S|2.0|The movie was okay kinda boring. I'm not sure why it was marketed to children as the theme, the dialogue and the language are highly inappropriate for kids.
0307887960|5.0|Excellent book, well written and explains the how and the why.  Lost 1 1/2 stone in a few weeks and have kept that weight off despite eating more or less 'normally' for the past couple of months.  Far more useful than the Recipe book.  On the face of it it would appear to be rather dull reading material, but in fact I found it very easy to read and wanted to know/learn more.      Highly recommended for anybody wanting to follow the Dukan Diet.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I have all but completely stopped watching big studio fiction films, and primarily stick w. documentaries, however the previous high marks and general interest I had after watching the trailer made me roll the $3.99 dice, turns out that was gamble hit the paydirt for a change as this film is a gem in every respect.  It's wonderfully written, directed, and acted...esp. Matthew McCougney who flat out delivered his best performance to date imho.      So anyway, first review...perhaps the last one I ever do, but I believe when a product or service delivers far beyond a customer's expectations, than it's the customer's obligation to spread the good word when avail.     5/5 stars all day long in my book...bravo Lionsgate, your know how to pick the winners and then deliver them better than any other studio, and Ive felt that way for a long time.
B004L79VUI|1.0|I waited for a while after the disc came out to listen, because I feared that it would be 'a wasted effort'. Don't know why I thought that but I did. I wanted to like this more than anything...and I just don't, I don't like anything about it. Perhaps a book of prose or poetry or..........anything but this. He just doesn't sound good singing imo and I just feel embarrassed for him and it's too bad cuz I wanted to like it.<br />BB
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Recently I tried to think of as many bands as I could that if they were to make a new album or come to town with a show, how many would contain the groups original lineup.  The answer was almost none. So I came to the conclusion that the only real way to judge a new release was to be not too concerned about the current lineup and also not to obsess about whether what the band is currently doing sounds exactly like something they may have done 30 years ago!  I grew up listening to Yes in the 70's and saw them in 1972 and then again in 2004 (both times original line-up both times great)  I will always love Yes 70's output through \\"Going for the One\\". I really haven't been blown away by anything they have put out since, except maybe Drama and some of Keys to Ascension.  But I'm glad they have continued because they are still phenomenal live and each record has moments of great Yes music.  I had no idea Yes was working on a new record and when I heard about it I was not expecting much.  I feel as though on records like \\"The Ladder\\" and \\"Magnification\\" Jon has gone from being a visionary to unfortunately a singer of bland New Age sentiments.  Not awful but kind of weak in my opinion.  I actually heard part of Fly from Here before I even knew that Jon was no longer in the band.    So now I have heard FFH 4 times and I am somewhat surprised and cautiously hopeful for this one.  There is I guess nothing wrong with judging a piece of art a few days after it has been released but it is a fact that time will be the real judge here.  Somethings rise while others fall with the passing of time.    My first impression of FFH is that it is a proper Yes album.  It has a 20 minute epic, a Steve Howe solo guitar piece and the right kind of album artwork.  And I am thrilled to say that it sounds like an old school Prog Album!!! However, it doesn't sound exactly like an old school Yes Prog album.  But, at least in my opinion this is an interesting development.  I'm hearing hints of KingCrimson, Pink Floyd, Kansas, Asia, along with Drama era no Jon Anderson in the music and since none of those groups are really doing this any more it may not be a bad idea for Yes to carry the Prog torch since in my mind they are the best at it anyway.  FFH may be a bit too MOR but at least so far all the music seems a good representation of this sound/style.  The music is very uplifting without being sappy and too new agey.    Apparently Benoit David was involved in a Yes tribute band and at times he sounds just like Jon singing.  I can't help but think that the injection of young blood has been really good for this new Yes record.  He does not drop the ball once, during the whole of the record and I think he deserves a lot of praise for this and maybe for fans of Yes music a new Star has been born. Two thumbs UP!!!
B004LWZW24|1.0|This movie is an absolute joke of a plot and is one of the most pathetically written storylines I have ever seen. If the \\"Time Travelers Wife\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\" had a baby together, it would be called INSIDIOUS.    I like watching horror movies for entertainment value and normally do not care much about storyline or flow, but that is where Insidious totally screws up - its presented in a way you are expected to take it seriously. It tries to walk the same lines as \\"The Exorcist\\" or \\"Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" which relates directly to possession but Insidious has it's own twist  with the idea of astro-travelers.    Insidious begins on the right foot building up tense and scary moments as the family moves into a new house and 'odd' things start to happen. It really does do things right in terms of instilling that creepy feeling into the viewers early on. The first half of the movie you are constantly wondering why happened to their son and what is all this strange stuff that is happening.     THEN, it totally nose-dives into a rushed explanation, ridiculous, almost laughable turn when they move into the second house. As soon as the psychic lady strapped on the gas mask to `cross to the other side' I quickly realized this movie was a total joke. I was waiting for the rest of Slipknot to come out and start playing `Wait and Bleed' (only metal fans will get this joke). I will cut the writers some slack on moronic `astro traveler / out of body experience' stuff but the way this `astro traveler' garbage plays out was just absurd and I found myself laughing more than once during these parts. Astro travelers can jump in and out of `the further/other side,' battle the bad guys in fist-a-cuffs, save cute little kids from Darth Maul looking `fire demons,' then wonder aimlessly in the dark with a kids Coleman lantern looking pathetic, but just have to `follow the voice' to go ahead and jump back to the real world. Perhaps it would have been better if the writers included ruby redslippers that you click together and just say `there is no place like home' to transport back. At this point in the film I was expecting anything absurd, so this would have fit right in.    I put Insidious up there as one of worst horror movies I have ever seen, right next to JEEPERS CREEPERS.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Rango is a different type of animated film, to say the least. It resembles a classic Western - with the new Sheriff, self-dealing mayor, and wretched citizens - more than it resembles anything Pixar has put out. The characters curse and can be downright grim. In short, this isn't a kid's movie.     If you can get beyond that fact, Rango is pretty entertaining. It has two great strengths. First, the animation is exceptional - easily the best I've ever seen. The hair and scales on the animals looks eerily real. At times I even wondered if ILM had inserted real animals into the film, particularly for the Hawks and Snakes.    Second, the characterization of Rango - the little green chameleon - becomes a more convincing and complex character than those found in many live-action Westerns. He begins as almost a Don Quixote type character, starts telling tall tales, and soon finds himself forced to respond to events. He never quite loses his inner doubts, but he also clearly possesses an inner strength. It's a joy to watch him grow. In addition, the film has some genuinely funny moments, mostly with Rango at the center.    Despite this, my criticism of the film is precisely the same one pointed out by so many other reviewers here: the film seems to want to appeal to adult and child audiences at the same time, but doesn't really succeed in doing this. So much of the film - the language, the allusions to Western classics, the grim ambience - is geared towards adults, that the more childlike scenes - particularly the cartoonish battle royale at the end - are all the more jarring.     Overall, if you're an adult or older kid who likes animated films, Rango's worth checking out.

B000063V8R|5.0|During the first season TNG was getting its feet wet, during the second the crew and cast coming together, and now for the third season they've produced a masterpiece. The series had matured impressively by this point (unlike the Original series, which was floundering in its third season). Almost every episode in this season is worth watching, either for the adventure, character development, or the thought-provoking plots. Some of the series' best episodes can be found in this season, including \\"Sins of the Father,\\" \\"Defector,\\" \\"Sarek,\\" \\"Offspring,\\" Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" and, of course, \\"Best of Both Worlds.\\" In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this season is the best of all Trek. Some of the bonus features are interest too, such as the making of these episodes. I only hope the blu-ray version comes out soon.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|The last installment in the Harry Potter film series, The Deathly Hallows Part Two lives up to the entire Potter filmography.  Everything from the storyline to the action packed scenes between the protagonist and main character Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and antagonist Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), in essence, continuous theme that the story centers upon finding the truth behind Harry's life.  An adventure that has taken Harry from child to young adulthood that has involved his rites of passage as a wizard in a very complex world and all of its complexities.  Viewers who have followed the story through books and films, they too share the experience that Harry and his friends and peers of Hogwarts, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupter Grint) will finally confront by the end of Deathly Hallows, the end of an era but also a beginning.<br /><br />The film contains a wide array of surprises and predictable moments that may appeal to the diehard Harry Potter fan or those just beginning to be exposed to a cavalcade of excitement that is the Potter experience.  The difference between Part one and Part two, is that although both compliment each other, the latter shows much more of a cohesion and progression of the storyline and the characters that finally come full circle; the last two films appeared to lean much more on the adolescent romantic schmooze between the main characters.  But with Part two, Harry is the central focus as well as a few unassuming moments, especially with underdog, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis). With the effective direction and production and cinematography of the film, these factors contributed to climatic scenes that included an assembly of pyrotechnics that resembled something out of The Lord of the Rings and other fantasized films as well as a massive display of force by a band of mobs from Voldemort's camp against Hogwarts, and the subtle ironic and sentimental scenes in the form of flashbacks that Harry recollects in order to find the truth about himself and what had brought him to his present dilemmas.<br /><br />By the end of Deathly Hallows Part Two, viewers may have their own conclusion or expectation of the film.  But as a hint, it is the choice that Harry makes that shows much triumph on his part as well as the people that helped him to overcome what had happened in the past.  And the film does not end without a bit of nostalgia, especially as the Harry Potter jingle, that twinkling melody, waivers in the background, that gives a sense of how far Harry, Hermione, and Ron have come since the first film.  Indeed, this may be a farewell to this chapter in the Harry Potter series, but when watching each and every scene, there is a possibility of another chapter in the life and experience of the boy wizard turned adult that has been left open for more adventures to be had, especially fans who have kept that prospect open.uth about himself and what had brought him to his present dilemmas.

B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture(1979) was a minor success at the box office. The studio was willing to green light a sequel with a lower budget of $11 million and most of the creative control was given to writer/producer Harve Bennett. Gene Roddenberry had an idea for Star Trek II where Klingons would go back in time and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but the movie studio didn't give approval. In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982), Khan(Ricardo Montalban) and his followers escape from a planet colony and steal the Starship Reliant. Khan Noonien Singh was the bad guy in the Star Trek episode 'Space Seed'. Khan also steals the Genesis Torpedo; it's a terraforming device that can be used as a weapon. Admiral Kirk(William Shatner) takes command of the Enterprise when Space Station Regula doesn't respond. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is dark and violent, but it's also action-packed and thrilling. It was well-made considering the limited budget. Director Nicholas Meyer(Time After Time) adds a swashbuckling sense of adventure into the film. The late Merritt Butrick is quite good as Kirk's son, David. He gives an earnest performance and doesn't \\"phone in\\" the role. This film has the famous catchphrase yelled by Kirk, \\"KHAAAAAAAN! KHAAAAAAAAAN!\\" James Horner(Aliens, Wolfen) wrote a good music score for Star Trek II and III.   Star Trek II started a story arc that completes itself in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home(1986). This film has an unpleasant scene where Khan puts a Ceti Alpha eel in Chekov's ear! Some clever stop motion, animation, and cloud tanks were used to keep the special effects budget under control. The models for the USS Enterprise and the USS Reliant were filmed with VistaVision and Dykstraflex Cameras. Some early computer animation was used for the Genesis Torpedo video. The Starfleet Uniforms were redesigned to look more like naval uniforms. They were made with red/burgundy cloth. The critical and box office success helped to renew interest in Star Trek in 1982. Star Trek III: The Search for Spock(1984) continues where this film leaves off.
0062060554|5.0|I was drawn to this book because of the premise.  What must it be like to awaken each morning and have to relearn your life?  Where are you?  Who is the man sleeping next to you?  How did you get here?      A \\"tragic accident\\" robs Christine Lucas of her memories.  She wakes each morning unable to remember the last twenty years of her life.  She has a rare form of amnesia that erases her memories as she sleeps each night.  Every morning she wakes up unaware of her surroundings, her husband a stranger, her life a mystery.  Each morning her husband must convince her that she is 47, not 29.  He must remind her that they are happily married and he his not a stranger.  With the help of a daily journal, Christine begins to piece together the fragmented memories of her life and begin to learn who she is now as well as who she was.      The story is told primarily through the journal that Christine has written.  The reader is unraveling her history and mysteries alongside Christine as she reacquaints herself with her memories.  What caused her amnesia?  Who is telling her the truth about her life?  Does she even want to know the truth each day?  Why would she see a doctor, but not tell her husband?  How can she know what is a true memory and what is her imagination trying to fill-in the blanks of her life?  Is someone hiding things from her or is she becoming paranoid?   When you can't remember who you are who can you trust?  Can you even trust yourself?  All of these questions and more form the basis for a thrilling, psychological ride.  The pages practically turn themselves as the questions pile up.  The reader feels as confused and terrorized as Christine as various aspects of her life come to light.  The heart-stopping conclusion left me as blind-sided as Christine.      I'll definitely be waiting for Watson's next novel!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I use it to play my PS3 while I watch movies on my 32\\", the screen is excellent quality.  Took it on a road trip, and was able to play games while I was in the motel room. The plastic the case is made of is high quality, I'm not afraid to drop it which is nice, the latches are sturdy.  The headphone jacks are a nice touch.  The G-155 has made true gaming mobile. Handhelds and portables pale in comparison to being able to take an actual console with you wherever you go.

B0047VEE0U|4.0|What can I say about this set? I'll admit I'm not as huge a fan of Desplat's score for \\"Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1\\" as others, but I was intrigued by this set because of the extras that come with it. I managed to get my edition at a heavy discount, which made it far more desirable.     To detail what's included, I'll begin with the basics: the CDs. The first disc is the standard release that is available singularly. It comes with the booklet but no track listing, so if you intend to store it anywhere but the box itself you won't know what track you're on (a bad con and something Watertower Music should have thought through). The second disc includes more of the score from the film not included on the first disc, including a beautiful choral track titled \\"My Love Is Always Here\\", which is probably the best thing out of all of Desplat's work and well worth the extra price of buying the whole set alone. There is also a DVD with a 5.1 mix of the score and a behind-the-scenes look at the composing and scoring of it. The LP I can't vouch for as I have no record player to try it out on.     As for the other features, each box comes with a certificate stating the number of the edition, a mid-sized poster of the Trio running from Snatchers, a copy of a piece of sheet music, and a double film cell. I was very impressed with the latter, getting scenes from both \\"Hallows\\" films that were very well chosen and made getting this set worth the price.    All in all, I wish more had been included considering the high retail price, but I am pleased with the bonuses I received in getting this rather than the standard issue soundtrack.
1451629184|5.0|Other reviewers have already summarized the book, but what struck me most was the tone of the writing having the voice of an adolescent at many instances.  At times I felt I was reading something that was written by an adolescent, when the author is speaking as an adult.  I guess I should not be surprised but it offers additional evidence of the damage that has been done.  Thankfully, she also talks about her movement forward and she has an incredibly positive attitude.
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I have a Nikon point and shoot camera and the side pocket was roomy, well-padded and adjustable.  I could have fit a lens if needed.  I took this bag on vacation and it made security a breeze.  I love the way it fit on my suitcase handle.  I also appreciated the ventilation on the back since Costa Rica in the rainy season is very muggy, which leads to my only complaint:  the company shows a rain cover on the early reviews but there isn't one.  I was able to pack my computer, camera, accessories, snacks, a journal, a water bottle and a light jacket. A great buy--very sturdy!
B003DT194G|4.0|I remember when this movie came out and was being reviewed on the Today Show while I was getting ready for school. They praised it and said this would make Charles Bronson a big star and after watching it a few times, I agree.  I had not been exposed to spaghetti westerns and found them a little different. The latest DVD version has much more to it than the original American cut version.  Several years went by and Bronson had become a top star internationally and I watched him climb from charater roles to top billing... most of them in a tough guy role. He fit his roles well because he looked and acted tough, not like many of the Hollywood actors that just weren't believable in those type roles.  I decided to watch \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" again. it got better as I became more accustomed to the uniqueness of 1960s & 70s films showing different perspectives. I was finally catching up to the new movie world that differed from the majority of phony American westerns of previous decades.   I bought the DVD Of \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" and realized it, especially with some of the commentary, was a special western. It was not only the dying of the old west through the movie but the dying of western movies as we knew them (numerous and most lacking realism).  The four stars (Bronson, Fonda, Robards, and Cardinale) were great, playing each part to their best. The support cast with a variety of European and American actors also did well. I think Sergion Leone and Ennio Morricone (music) did some of their best work here. Leone made a big budget spagetti western that equaled or even surpassed some of the American western classics. The long camera shots of the tough western characters' faces was magnificent. The two major gunfights with Bronson taking on three gunman at the railway station in the beginning and the ending with Fonda were short but powerful. The buildup worked.  Watch the complete (uncut) movie with utmost attention and you won\\"t be disappointed. I loved the ending....emotional for the west that was.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I never heard of the flaming lips, until I read an article mr.Coyne. it was interesting and I decided to try yoshimi as the first purchase. This disc is short of nothing amazing, if u like maroon5, or coldplay then this disc will put you where you need to be.

073935650X|5.0|I could not stop listening to this book. It is a must READ / LISTEN to. I have already told many people about the book. I have told my kids they have to listen to  or read the book,  to show them that no matter how small they think something is it may be a lot more to someone else . That maybe by listening to this that can see Suicide is a Permanente solution to a temporary problem. That like in the book there are people who do care and can help.
B000JQV68A|1.0|Their is no action, the characters are boring, self absorbed snobs. By the end of the book I wanted the two main characters to kill one another. I would have settled for murder suicide. Fitzgerald did not even deliver that. I hope I don't download any more Fitzgerald books. This was simply awful.
0670022411|2.0|I can't say what bothered me the most about this story...was it the contrived romance between vampire and witch?  Perhaps the fact that about half of the storyline consists of explanations and not too much in the way of action?  Or is it that the main character spends an inordinate amount of time waiting for things to happen?       The story is about Diana Bishop, a witch who finds an enchanted manuscript that reacts strangely to her magic.  Due to this, she starts attracting the attention of a slew of other supernatural characters, many of whom are trying to obtain the manuscript from her and do her harm.  Diana also attracts the attention of a vampire named Matthew Clairmont and, of course, a relationship between them starts developing.   Sadly, this is where the story falls apart because of all the conversations.  In fact, that summarizes the whole book - characters talking to each other incessantly.  They talk about the taboo of a witch/vampire relationship, they talk about Diana's background, they talk about Matthew's background, they talk about the manuscript.  They talk and talk and talk throughout and, after a while, I started skimming through all the conversations, looking for juicier parts or hoping that the story would move along to no avail.  There are some great fantasies out there and you would be better served reading one of those.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought this because I wanted to just get out and run where ever I wanted to but still keep track of the distance.  Now I can do that all in the convenience of only wearing a watch.  I love it and it does exactly what I wanted it to do.  I did have some trouble with the bezel area at first.  After figuring out it was going to a \\"power saving mode\\" (duh!) that helped me determine why the bezel wasn't responding at all.  After figuring that out, I then also switched it to a \\"high sensitivity\\" mode and that completely took care of any bezel problems for me.  I love the interval training function too that I can choose the exact time or distance for both the interval period and the rest period.  I love that when I run in different locations in my home state and visit family in a neighboring state I don't have to wonder why it seems easier/harder because I can see the difference in elevation.  Still learning all it can do but it seems to have everything I want and more!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is awesome. Really addictive. Simple to pick up, difficult to master. Some of the later levels are really difficult. The writing (such as the \\"almanac\\"'s desciption of zombies and plants are hilarious) is great, the weapons are great.  Only negative about it is the amount of space it takes up. 76 MB or so. Pretty large file on my phone. (HTC Incredible). Price was right. for free.
B0010ZR160|4.0|After the success of Mystic River, I'd been hoping that someone would bring author Dennis Lehane's working-class PI team of Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro to the screen. When Ben Affleck, of all people, did so for his first film as a director, he chose to film the fourth film in the series, Gone Baby Gone. 4-year-old Amanda McCready has disappeared, and her aunt brings in Patrick and Angie, who are from the neighborhood, to help with the case. It seems at first that the duo are successful at developing a lead, but readers of Lehane know that things are never what they seem on the surface in his stories. Ben Affleck does a good job in capturing the atmosphere, the complexity, and the moral ambiguity of Lehane's novel--he has more directing chops than I'd have expected.<br /><br />The cast is pretty good. Casey Affleck does a pretty good job as Patrick Kenzie, although he looks a little too boyish at times. Michelle Monaghan is also solid as Patrick's longtime friend and partner, and sometime lover, although she's limited by the way the script marginalizes Angie a lot of the time (the Angie of the books has a lot more fire in her). The supporting cast is excellent. Amy Ryan was, deservedly, Oscar-nominated as Helene McCready, Amanda's substance-abusing, self-absorbed mother. Also excellent are Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman as Boston PD heavyweights involved in the case, Titus Welliver as Lionel, Helene's brother, and rapper Slaine in a cameo as Patrick and Angie's sociopathic friend Bubba Rogowski. I'd love to see him return as Bubba if someone were to ever film any of the other Kenzie/Gennaro novels.<br /><br />There is a reasonable selection of extras on the DVD release: a couple of \\"making of\\" featurettes, some deleted scenes and an alternate ending, and a commentary from Ben Affleck and co-screenwriter Aaron Stockard.
B004K7HMJ6|3.0|'Who You Are' is Jessie J's appropriately titled first studio album. \\"Why\\", you might ask? Well, every studio artist is a product. Their image, sound, style, vibe, etc are all designed to appeal to a particular demographic and in Jessie's case I'm not quite sure what that demo is supposed to be. Her niche genre is unclear and includes everything from ballads about overcoming adversary to traditional uplifting uptempo pop tracks, topped with a big band number. I may have even detected some reggae/dancehall influence. That said, is this approach odd? Yes. Confusing? Yes. Refreshing? Very.<br /><br />Apparently, Jessie J is no stranger to writing hits and, in fact, co-wrote Miley Cyrus's 'Party in the USA' among songs for other artists such as Chris Brown. She shares writing credits on this album and, as mentioned elsewhere, in today's money/credit hungry corporate powered world, 'writing' credits aren't as viable as they once were. However, judging from her brilliant charismatic live performances, I'm inclined to believe Jessie J is the real deal. This is a solid first album and I believe there is enough talent here to garner an adequate fan base. As previously stated, it appears this album is an experimental introductory endeavor where Jessie J dons many musical hats in an effort to discover who she is as an artist.<br /><br />First off, the ballads drag the whole album down and the only one worth listening to is 'Big White Room', a live performance where Jessie's pitch perfect voice saves the day. The track is very stripped down and consists of just Jessie and a lone acoustic guitarist. I honestly had no idea this was live until the audience started applauding about 1/3rd of the way into the song. Her live voice really is that good and I wish she had better material, but I doubt this is the last we'll be seeing of the up and coming pop star. Give her time and I'm confident that her sound will evolve, but until then more lackluster tracks follow including 'Who's Laughing Now'. Jessie 'confronts' her tormentors via song, donning an uber mockney accent that really grates on my last nerve despite the fact that she's clearly parroting those who did her wrong. 'Do It Like A Dude' has a hip-hop/reggae heavy rhythm laced with rock guitar riffs; a love or hate track for sure. Personally, it doesn't work for me as I prefer to 'do it like a lady', but as an open bisexual perhaps this track is a not so subtle allusion to Jessie J's sexual proclivities? Well, 'Love', a bright even tempered pop track, definitely is and states as much: \\"Love doesn't choose a boy or a girl/when I met you you hugged my heart and filled my world\\". It appears Jessie's personality is as varied as her body of work.<br /><br />Lyrically, this album is not half bad. J is no Bob Dylan, but for a pop album there were instances where I was legitimately impressed. 'Price Tag', for instance, is co-written by Jessie herself and laments the music industry having taken a turn for the worst: \\"We need to take it back in time/When music made us all unite/And it wasn't low blows and video hoes/Am I the only one getting' tired?\\", not particularly original, but enjoyable just the same. 'Mamma Knows Best' is an invigorating big band/jazzy number and I hope she continues along this vein in the future, her voice certainly suits the style. Jessie has the ability to belt it out with the best of them; look out Lady Gaga, move over Beyonce! The song could  have easily tended towards her fellow UK songbirds (Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Adele, etc) and been more brooding and dark, but instead ended up a self-aggrandizing power anthem. Nice one, Ms. J!<br /><br />The album closes with the title track which is another underwhelming ballad bringing the final tally to about four (not including 'Big White Room') which is four too many. For the record, pop stars put far too much weight on ballads and they often end up being the weakest tracks on an album. I feel a solid pop album should have one or two ballads and that's only if they are stellar. Go big or go home. Ballads require a lot of raw emotion and should feel like it's coming from a real place, but usually ends up sounding like filler (which I loathe). This is really a criticism of pop music in general, but Jessie unfortunately manages to fall prey to this trap as well. If Jessie J nixed the paltry ballads this would easily have been a four star album, but I can only give it three (rounded down from 3 ½). Overall, I'd say it's a promising debut and recommend it to anyone with an eclectic taste in music who's also looking for a breath of fresh air.hat's only if they are stellar. Go big or go home.

0307346617|5.0|This is the first review of a book I have written.  I tend to be somewhat harsh in my reviews of horror and zombie books, and at first glance I didn't think I would be that impressed with this book but I have to admit this was probably the best zombie book I have read.  Sure still some flaws in the logic; zombies aren't likely to over power a modern army with thousands of rounds of ammo and high explosives but that doesn't really detract from the fun of the book.  Have to admit couldn't put this book down, read it in only a few days which is unusual for me nowadays.  The only zombie book I've given 5 stars too.<br /><br />Now that I have read some other zombie books while still in my top 10, it's no longer my favorite try Craig DeLouie Tooth and Nail(#2) and J.L. Bourne Day by Day Armageddon(#1)
B0000013G9|5.0|I hadn't heard this album since I was about 13...I'm not sure what made me want to get it again, but I'm glad I did. Took me right back to when I was a kid.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Wow this is an incredible piece of historical blues collection, and the compilation is so well done, Robert Johnson would be so proud to see this himself!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Like many others, I read this in one sitting.  Indeed, it was tough to put down.  In the forward to the book, Jaycee says that this book was written in her own voice.  No, there were no fancy copy editors, no one to tell her to move things around, omit this or add that.  The fact that it WAS written in her own voice is what makes it so good.    The fact that this is a best seller is no mystery.  Too many people want to know what HAPPENED? And how did she deal with it?  Survive? And what is she like now?  For many, it is hard to understand how she could be in captivity and not try to escape--this book makes this very clear.  It is told in HER voice--with HER thoughts, so understanding that is easy once you've read it.  I cried.  A lot.  But this is also the tale of survival, and in that, it is truly inspirational.  How does someone get through even one hour, let alone that many years of horrible abuse?  Her strength is a true inspiration.  Jaycee, stay strong, go forth and have a wonderful life.
B003IPC5UC|5.0|Stuart Price and his team did a top job with the musical arrangements here. The production enhances rather than overwhelm Kylie's breathy, airy vocals.<br /><br />The club heavy theme is designed to get even the palest wallflower shaking their booty and titties vigorously and with abandon on the dance floor.<br /><br />I kind of like the electronic bit on All The Lovers which feels like a nice ear massage. Instead of Better Than Today, I reckon the itchy Can't Beat The Feeling or the highly infectious Too Much would have been better choices as singles.<br /><br />The bonus DVD comes with concert footage from the For You For Me US tour not on the Kylie X 2008 Tour DVD. I also enjoyed the Making of All The Lovers video. Where else can you do naughty stuff like that except in music videos? OK, I know but I will not elaborate...
0002247402|3.0|(Spoilers ahead) For me the first two books were filled with exciting events, and the whole narration featured many enjoyable characters interacting with each other, i.e. Robert and Cersei, Lord Baelish and Ned, Tyrion and Jon, Arya and Syrio. Also, it was easy to grasp the geography of the story. In the latest 2 books, exciting and history-making events are few and far between. As far as I can tell, only 4 truly important events took place in books 4 and 5: Cersei destabilizing King's Landing and allowing the priests to rise to power; Jon letting the wildlings through the wall; Dany marrying that guy and disappearing on a dragon; and Aegon beginning his conquest of Westeros. Since the Brienne, Stannis, Jamie, Tyrion, Bran, Arya, Selyse, Melisandra, and Greyjoy narratives haven't really gone anywhere yet, I don't count them. I kind of feel like we're reading Martin's notes instead of the grand narrative as it should be.<br /><br />Meanwhile, most of the interesting characters are separated from each other and paired with a host of less enjoyable or ephemeral characters. Particularly annoying was all the time wasted on Quentyn Martell, who we met for the first time in this book; he did basically nothing of note for 100 pages and then he died. Furthermore, he and his companions were not in the least entertaining to read about.<br /><br />And the disjointed maps make it difficult for me to figure out where one place is in relation to all the other places. Mr. Martin, please finish your map of Essos! And then please make a single map of the whole region!<br /><br />I am sad to admit that while reading books 4 and 5 I continuously consoled myself that HBO, if it ever got around to these books, would surely edit the narration down into a polished, elegant series. They'll probably add more sex, though.
B001HN694K|5.0|This may be considered a childs movie but I disagree.  I am 63 years old and I love this movie.  The story line is great and it has a great love story if you just open your heart.  I have been told I a child like heart...I really don't see that to be a wrong thing.
3832793836|4.0|I bought this book after seeing the amazing exhibition of Elliott Erwitt's photography at New York's International Center of Photography.    Erwitt's work is broad in scope, including more traditional photo journalism, as well as what would better be described as street photography. Much of his work takes scenes from everyday life and finds the irony and humour in them. There's a long-necked bird right next to a pipe sticking from the ground that forms the same shape as the bird. There's a woman in a market with two coconuts on a shelf placed exactly where her breasts would be. We see silhouetted people on a train platform, who appear to be African Americans, while an advertising sign promotes Griffin Allwite white shoe polish. There are numerous hilarious pictures of dogs, including one with a tiny chihuahua next to a woman's feet and the feet of a great dane, that are almost as big as the chihuahua itself.    This book is very complete. It contains all my favourite photos from the exhibition and many more.    I would rate this book a five except for one thing. Many of the photos span across both pages on the spread. In the paperback version, this means the centres of many photos get somewhat lost in the binding. I saw a hardcover version of this book at the exhibition, and in contrast, its pages could open very wide so that the full picture could be properly seen.    Overall though, this is a great book with the best work of one of the best photographers of all time.
B0012GMWCU|5.0|Yes sir, you are so right, Willie Dixon is the BLUES! Classic album always has been one of the best discs to own among the trad Blues artists of all time!
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Mark is a genius.  All of his albums are filled with beautiful, meaningful stories and wonderful creative musicality, not to mention his masterful, emotive guitar playing.  Get Lucky is no exception.  Great tunes on this one.  If you are a Mark Knopfler fan, you most certainly will run this one in the ground as I have.  Not a bad song on this album.  So far from the Clyde makes my hairs stand up on end.  We music lovers are very lucky to have Mark Knopfler's creations to enjoy.  Thanks Mark!  And please keep putting them out!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Last month I saw Brandi open for Ray Lamontagne at the Britt Festival and up to that point had very little exposure to Brandi's music.  She is an excellent performer and I became an instant fan.  I recently bought The Story and have listened to it every day since I bought it.  I love it.  I'm also an audiophile, so the sound of how cd's are recorded is very important to me.  This cd is recorded above average- it sounds clean, wide sound stage and strong bass in many of the songs.   Her songs are intimate and she sings with emotion.  Highly recommended cd.
031261246X|4.0|I picked up Zero Day as the first book to read on my new Kindle. I was expecting the book to be an expose on technology, but probably a pretty dry read. Boy was I wrong!

B000002NAK|4.0|Love the music, had lost my original CD hence I wanted to purchase it again, not the same as \\"downloading\\"
B004USRKX8|3.0|I'll provide only a quick review here, so that others may avoid some purchasing confusion.  The music deserves 5 stars; the product information, or lack thereof, has made me insert a 3-star review.  I have to basically agree with \\"mediafreak\\" (7/5/11).  The 5/24/11 release info, and the accompanying disc, seems to be in error, probably from inaccuracies passed down from WEA, or their distributors.  Information here, and on other sites, e.g. Barnes & Noble and Borders, show, for approximately $7.99, a May 2011 two-disc re-mastered version. Sometimes the UPC codes match up, sometimes not.  The supposed 2011 disc I just received from Amazon is not the one with the bonus track, nor does it indicate any other date on disc or packaging, other than the original vinyl release date of1971.  It only duplicates the original vinyl/sleeve information.  (This may possibly be corrected by the time you read this).  Unfortunately, I have no other CD version in my collection with which to compare it to.  Suffice to say, the sound isn't bad at all, particularly for an AAD release, and, of course, the music is timeless, especially if one went through the personal \\"changes\\" that were happening around 1970 -1971, particularly the suspicion that the dream was disappearing.  If I had this purchase to do over again, I'd probably go to another outlet, and hold them to the advertising.  Since the price was good, and I don't want to hassle a return, I'm keeping this item.  But, be aware of this product discrepancy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is no doubt one of my favorite series. In this book, we are introduced to Katniss, a very interesting character. When she is sent to compete in these games, you learn that she's not the kind of person who goes into a tricky situation going, \\"Maybe I can make it out of this.\\" She thinks, \\"There are so many ways I can die right now.\\" Her love triangle between Peeta and Gale will keep you waiting and wanting more. I remember reading this in a day, where I only put down the book to either eat when I was shaking of hunger or when I thought I'd pee in my pants if I didn't go to the bathroom. The Hunger Games is incredibly gripping, engulfing, heart-pounding entertainment for people of all ages.
B004APVI1G|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie on regular DVD=it was already great & better on blu-ray but a bit disappointed not enough 3D eye-popping effects but love the movie itself. wish i just bought it on blu-ray instead coz it's a bit costly. It's already amazing in 2D can't really tell as much in 3D but some that has the 3D effects was very good
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|if you're a fan of evangelion you still NEED to watch this. this is required viewing for any otaku.  this keeps to the story with a few changes (and omissions) all the memorable scenes are kept.  if your new to the evangelion franchise this is the first of 4 movies (as of this review only the first 2 have been released), im not going to go into details as there will be spiolers and the product description has the basics down well  there are 2 versions of this movie out ([[ASIN:B002KYIAJ2 Evangelion: 1.01 You Are (Not) Alone]] (or simply eva 1.0), and this one evangelion 2.22 (or simply eva 2.22), I don't believe there was a release of Evangelion: 2.02 You Can [Not] Advance but I could be wrong and that's also for another review) if you're wondering \\"whats the difference between [[ASIN:B002KYIAJ2 Evangelion: 1.01 You Are (Not) Alone]] and eva 1.11?\\" well here it is: this is a little longer and you probably wont even notice unless you play them both at the same time. the main difference is the special features this one has a LOT of them and the other has little to none  if you're a collector (like me) get 1.11 if you just want to see it and have it on your shelf, and or are budget minded get [[ASIN:B002KYIAJ2 Evangelion: 1.01 You Are (Not) Alone]]
B001NFNFF8|2.0|Do not know why I didn't like this movie...but maybe I didn't understand the story line.  Hope others enjoyed it.
031261246X|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book - I had high hopes as to the story line and the accuracy (given the author).  Unfortunately I couldn't stomach more than the first few pages.  Why is it necessary to ruin what otherwise could have been a great book by starting it off with illicit sex and vulgar language?  Seriously disappointing.  I cannot recommend this book.

B0033QEUGS|5.0|Nazareth were a fellow Scottish hard rock band that had worked their way up with several albums in the early 70's, finally hitting their stride around 72-73 with minor gems like Loud N Proud and Razamanz. Breaking into the US/UK charts with those 2 records, the band had worked up a following and in 1975 released Hair Of The Dog. If you're a fan of 70's hard rock or early heavy metal at all..this album is an essential. The title track is of course a familar FM classic rock radio staple. A kick ass slab of 70's hard rock with a vicious vocal, a mean guitar, a killer rock groove and topped all off with tambourine, cowbell and talkbox. It's a crown jewel for the solidified 'hard rock' genre. Followed up by the gem Miss Misery, a bludgeoning riff worthy of Sabbath. Slow paced but with a more livlier chorus, its a first rate rocker in an album ripe with inspiration. The main reason behind this albums success was the top 40 hit ballad Love Hurts, which would remain Naz's most recognizable hit to mainstream music fans and continue to be a popular cultural song to use in soundtracks/movies/advertising etc. While it is a nicely done ballad it does suffer from overplay throughout the years.    The album kicks into gear again with Changin' Times. A truely on fire 6 minute rocker, starting off slow building its verses till it speeds up to a chugging heavily inspired rocker with some great guitar work. It's probably the best song on the album actually. The ball keeps rolling with another cover (the first being Love Hurts originally done by The Everly Brothers), Beggar's Day, being done before them by Crazy Horse. It's a sludgy mid tempo rocker that has some great vocal work and a great feel but the cool aspect of the song is that as it dirges along it soon stops and transforms into its companion track Rose In The Heather. An instrumental sort of poignant track driven by synths and guitars, its a pretty lovely song, but it doesnt present itself as soft or \\"wussified\\". It's a greatsong that adds an air of diversity. The band shows more style with its blues work out Whiskey Drinkin' Woman. It might be the low point of the album but its a good cut and reveals a nice laid back feel before the band hits you with its anamoly track.    Please Don't Judas Me. Something like this was rarely heard in the many pantheon of 70's hard rock groups (think April Wine, Foghat, Ted Nugent, Foreinger, BTO, Kiss, Bad Company, Black Oak etc). It's a 9 minute slow building highly atmosphereic synth laden piece with eastern sounding guitar parts over lyrics dealing with the singer insisting not to wrong him in any way. It's a strange song indeed and has a omnious feel to it. After all these years, some might find Naz's hard rock dated but one thing is, in the style of 70's hard rock this album remains a high water mark. Naz had some slight experimental type rock albums before this that slowly found them carving out their arena style hard rock sound and after breaking big with this record they continued to copy the style of this album and they did make some good albums after this (No Mean City, Malice In Wonderland) but this record overall was really lightning in the bottle. Note for note highly inspired, fun and rocking record that stands up and even proves itself to be a little different.

0670022411|4.0|It hardly seems worth reviewing this, since there are already over 800 reviews on the site. Still, I'll take a shot at it. This was an entertaining book, with attractive, sympathetic characters. Matthew Claremont is a vampire. Diana Bishop is a witch. In this fictional world, there are rules against the two intermingling, but it's love at first sight and we're off to the races.    I have not read the Twilight books, and so the supposed cliche of Matthew's character was not so apparent to me. Diana is a modern woman, spunky and self-reliant. Matthew is 1500 years old and has some archaic ideas, a high testosterone attitude toward life and all its creatures foremost among them.    The book had some problems. For instance, the two take refuge in a medieval castle--Matthew's ancestral home--inhabited by his mother and another strong female vampire. Diana is then attacked and carried off by witches. After she is rescued, the two run away to upstate New York, to Diana's ancestral house, inhabited by her two aunts. The rationale is that Matthew can protect her from Vampires but not from witches. Huh? Here, of course, they are attacked by vampires, and it might as well have been witches. Whereupon it is agreed that Diana's aunts will take refuge back in the castle with the female vampires. None of this makes a great deal of sense but the plot moves briskly along. The almost immediate (and very sappy) infatuation between Matthew and Diana is the worst part of this book, being overwrought and overdone, and I skipped over these parts rather quickly.    The book sets up nicely for a sequel and since I read this one with some enjoyment, I'll keep an eye out for the next as well. Still, I'll wait for the library to get it. I wish I could give this book 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll be generous...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is so wonderful, I am trying to read it slowly so it will last.  If you love fanciful, creative books that are a mental vacation, you will LOVE this book.  Ransom Riggs, PLEASE keep writing!!!
0553801473|2.0|Short and sweet - still love the series but it seems like lots of pages that don't move the plot forward.  It is starting to feel more and more like the Wheel of Time series which we all know ground to a halt.  Hopefully Mr. Martin will not die before he completes the series.<br /><br />I first gave this a 3 for its OK but downgraded to a 2 as I realized I didn't like it.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This a very good movie with a great story line and great action movie.  I really liked this one better than the first one.
B0007OCG56|5.0|I love this movie.  It is about being a decent person and knowing there is value in doing the right thing.  the movie is insightful and touching.   This is not a brainless action/comedy/ romantic comedy movie.   It is an observation of real interactions between people and how people and things in life dont turn out the way you expected.  That being said, it is a sweet, sensitive story and the homes are fabulous.
0060930349|5.0|This is a wonderful book full of known and unknown facts about American history.  Johnson doesn't just focus on politics but also illuminates religion, artists, businessmen, race, architecture, and music.  Johnson is an admirer of the U.S., but he doesn't let that cloud his observations about our culture.<br /><br />Johnson is British and says in the introduction that he had not been taught anything about U.S. history.  He came to the subject fresh and delves in with unabashed enthusiasm.<br /><br />The book has 976 pages and becomes easier to read as it continues.<br /><br />I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The entire trilogy is amazing.  The first book is the best, but all the books are fun.  Fun read for teens and adults.  Good twist at the end.
006112429X|5.0|This book took my breath away the first time I read it.  I loved the way it was set up, seducing the reader into the story and allowing us to sit between a husband and wife as they approached parenting a unique and challenging child.  Eva knows there is something amiss, and Franklin refuses to see it. The end is heart-rending.    But it was the second and third reading - some time later, that really allowed me to examine this book as a love story between Eva and her difficult son Kevin - the connection that they fight through and that Eva never gives up on, although the tragic ending reflects horribly on her as a parent.  I love Eva more for her ability to state that there was something wrong with Kevin while still trying to love him in her own way.    I am looking forward to seeing this when it comes out as a movie - I hope they capture the feeling that I have had with this book.

B004X8W4A4|3.0|Book2 in the Nikki Heat series<br /><br />Without any doubt this charming series is intended for fans of the TV program 'Castle'. Each new addition mimics the warm chemistry created by the show. The plot sends the readers' imagination on a wild ride that has ample cute and amusing twists. This latest is undeniably entertaining, although the writing is run of the mill and predictable; we nevertheless find red herrings, snippets of police work, moments of tensions and romance between the two leads and a snappy dialog.<br /><br />'Naked Heat' centers on the murder of a well-known gossip columnist famous for her revealing articles on people in the public eye. It is rumoured that she is about to release a career making tell-all, one that will blow the minds of all concerned. We follow Nikki Heat and her partner hotshot reporter/writer Jameson Rook and her team of detectives on the trail of the murderer of this high profile columnist. The clues some good some misleading takes us through a maze of information, a world of secrets, cover-ups and scandals as they trade barbs and innuendos all the while taking heat from the press and their superiors.<br /><br />This fun and fast read will appeal to both regulars of the TV show and enthusiasts of simple, exciting mystery novels.

B001HN694K|2.0|I waited a long time to see this film and besides the good CG, the movie was just boring.   The story was bad and there was very slow character development. I yawned four times and i watched it in 3D, That's how bad it was..
B0034G4ORC|3.0|This movie is not bad, it's just that it really lacks any kind of substance or originality. The best way that I can recommend this movie would be if you are the kind of person who likes action movies with great special effects and somewhat cliche depictions of marines, I would not hesitate to recommend it, You will love it. If you're the kind of person who strives for a little more in your flicks, new ideas, deep thinking, intelligent dialogue, you won't find it here. This is a straight action humans vs. aliens movie with very little attention focused on who the aliens are or what they are doing on earth, the soldiers seem completely unimpressed by them as well, like seeing an alien is a regular occurrence for them. Not my thing but I know there are people out there that will enjoy this.

B004WPT3ZM|1.0|I'm a Megadeth fan, have been for years. I had a lot of hope for this release especially for the fact that it was going to be the original version remastered. I also had hopes that it would not be a victim of the infamous Loudness Wars. My fears were confirmed upon hearing this version. It's unfortunate that we are never going to get a remastered version of this album that isn't highly compressed. To give an example, just take a look at the waveform posted here (edit: amazon doesn't allow links):  go to stevehoffman(dot)tv /forums/showpost.php?p=6747978&postcount=78    for a very good presentation of what the 'Loudness War' is all about, watch this educational video:  go to youtube and add this to the end of the URL: watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ    At least it's not as bad as the unlistenable CD version of Death Magnetic..

0439023521|5.0|When I first learned what the book was about I cringed, and thought how could anyone want to read this? But I did, and I absolutely love it. It was exciting and suspensful. There were twists thrown in at every turn. I was very happy with it, the second one however not so much. But the hunger games was amazing
0425242099|5.0|Kiss of Snow was one of the most expected book in a series. This is the book that fans of the series has been anxiously waiting for, the one that's going to knock you off your feet; however, all those other highly-expected books had been huge letdowns for me. I approached Kiss of Snow with great trepidation, especially since this is the book that was the first in this series to be released in hardcover. I am ecstatic to say that I more than received my money's worth with this book.    I had started this series with the dismally unsatisfying Mine to Possess and decided the series was not for me. But I was persuaded to give the first book a read. I was extremely pleased with Slave to Sensation, so I decided to give the series a second chance.    As much as I loved Lucas and Sascha, I've always preferred wolves over cats and I was instantly drawn to the SnowDancer alpha, Hawke. I was equally intrigued that this dangerous, vicious wolf had given refuge to his sworn enemies, a family of Psy defectors, the Laurens. I completely adored the Lauren family, their sense of familial bond and willingness to sacrifice all to save the Lauren children from rehabilitation grabbed my heart. I bought and devoured all the books featuring the SnowDancers, Hawke, and the Lauren clan. Caressed by Ice is my second favorite book after Kiss of Snow.    Young Sienna Lauren is a marvelous heroine, she is vulnerable, brave, and strong in her laser-focus of obtaining what she wants, the stubborn, possessive, and irreverent Hawke.    Slave to Sensation and Kiss of Snow are excellent bookends to this story arc. It was especially cool that the alphas of SnowDancer and DarkRiver ended up with Psy females as mates. I prefer the Psy/Changeling parings over human/changeling or changeling/changeling unions because Psy females bring a sense of wonder and imagination to the story when they enter into the world of emotions, their journey adds layers of discoveries in the dance with the hardened alpha males.     In contrast, the changeling females, Mercy and Indigo, already have personalities that are set in stone, so there's little new to learn about them; the human heroine, Talin, mostly came across as hysterical, self-centered, and indecisive.    I found nearly everything about Kiss of Snow to be phenomenal. The battlefield action was sensational and the romantic build up between Hawke and Sienna was perfectly executed. The secondary story with Lara and Walker was a nice addition that advanced the story quite nicely.     Usually I dislike cutsey and/or surly kids in my romance stories but I love the lovable, intelligent SnowDancer youngsters, Toby, Marlee, and Ben. One exchange between Hawke and six year old Ben, \\"Didja really put Sinna in jail\\", is one of the most delightful scenes in this book.    This was a very emotional story that delivered on its long-awaited promise and is certainly one of the most entertaining and satisfying books I've read so far this year.
B000005RQT|2.0|Deep Purple In Rock somehow wasn't as enjoyable as the first time I heard it way back when as an early '70s nymph. The sound has been ably enough remastered for the 25th Anniversary (UK) CD edition (what I purchased from Amazon), but the whole thing just fell flat for me. There are alternative versions of some of the songs on this offering, along with short audio chats by the band members, but that doesn't help the thing at all. It's still an archaic example of rock music from the year 1970. Even the liner notes are a snooze. In its defense, it was this line-up of the band's freshman effort, so they were assuredly feeling their way through the genre while trying to distance themselves from their first era. It just didn't gel though compared to a lot of what else was out there at the time. I guess I had originally bought it way back because I'd learned Ian Gilliam had sung the part of Jesus Christ on the studio album of Jesus Christ, Superstar and wanted more. One of 'In Rock's songs, Child in Time, made it onto what many can argueably agree to as the band's best, Deep Purple Made in Japan. Get the remastered and extended version of that CD for an unregrettable and thoroughly enchanting listening experience.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Not only is this a phenomenal film but the blu ray is jam packed with special features to make any fan more than happy
B002ZG98C8|4.0|While watching \\"Machete\\" I flashed back to other films tackling the immigration problem, \\"The Visitor\\" and \\"Frozen River\\".  What you say?  Isn't this a grindhouse picture? That said director Robert Rodriguez cleverly incorporates themes that are close to his heart into an action extravaganza that has a lot of heart and more than a passing tongue-in-cheek sensibility.  This movie is akin to the first installment of \\"The Transporter\\" where social themes are couched in what is essentially an action movie.  The film falls a little short of the classic grindhouse homage that Rodriguez achieved with \\"Planet Terror\\".  It's possible that Rodriguez captured the grindhouse ethos so succinctly in that film that he had nowhere to go but down.  One minor quibble is the acting prowess of star Danny Trejo.  Trejo is a fine character actor but when asked to carry the burden of lead he falls a little short.  The scars and pockmarks on his face say infinitely more than anything inherent in his performance.  Not to worry because Rodriguez surrounds him with an expert cast.  Who would have thought of Steven Seagal capable of giving a full bodied performance.  This made a better \\"trailer\\" than a fully realized feature.  That doesn't escape the fact that it is a consistently entertaining flick.
B0053F042G|4.0|Just a great movie. No real hidden political agenda (other than perhaps wringing every bit you can out of a servicemans enlistment). GREAT acting, plot, direction, editing.....a real surprise considering every other movie I have been unfortunate enough to see that was released this year.<br />I only regret that I didnt see it at the theaters....woulda been even better.....but the video is certainly worth at least renting.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have an HTC Hero that's not even 2 yrs old.  I spent a lot of time picking out what music I wanted it still has 12 hrs to go.  Then I find out that my Android version isn't high enough.  It's 1.5 and  the App needs 1.6.    VERY disappointed !!!
B004LWZW24|3.0|Insidious starts out so great. Creepy, subtle, very scary. Like all great horror movies, it hinted at things; allowed you to catch fleeting glimpses or hear sounds. That which remained out of sight or imagined was scarier than what you were seeing.     Then....we get the seance scene.     This is the point where this great horror movie jumps the shark tank and becomes a modern day \\"Poltergeist,\\" leaving nothing to the imagination and relying on schlock instead of shock.     It's worth seeing for the first half, but I was really disappointed because of what might have been. I just couldn't believe how far the it fell from it's oh so promising first half.
1400067936|5.0|Loved the book.  Easy to read, easy to understand.  Anyone with an interest in finance should, investing or basic bath in general should pick this up.  Explains very well how large investment groups can loose billions upon seemingly \\"correct\\" information trends.
0451228375|5.0|This is the second of two novels about the village of Kingsbridge, and the central role played by the cathedral. One does not need to read these two novels in order--\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" took place two centuries before \\"World without End,\\" in England in the twelfth century.<br /><br />This book is characterized, as the earlier volume (both running to 1,000 pages--and it is truly amazing how the length of these books does NOT prove a deterrent to completing them), with a rich set of characters, with an interwoven plot, featuring many subplots, and the entire novel being placed in a time and place that has the ring of verisimilitude. Follett has done his research. One can almost understand how one would construct a bridge or a cathedral or. . . . These processes simply ring true, and Follett's research and writing skills make this work.<br /><br />Four young people, at the outset, witness a sanguinary fight in a forest, and this event has ramifications throughout their lives. What occurred there--and what was hidden--emerges as critical at the climax of the novel. The four are followed as their lives separate and sometimes intertwine. We see characters face challenges that thwart their desires, such as the love between Caris and Merthin that was displaced by internal politics and the dynamics of the community. The church is at the center of the village, and we see the emergent leader of the priory use and abuse his power, itself leading to many problems that the community and its key figures had to address for there to be progress.<br /><br />The book covers many important historical events which affect the thrust of the plot line--from plague to the ambitions of church leaders to the intrigues within the king's court to the effects of some of the men's lust and love toward key women characters toward the place of cries of \\"witchcraft\\" in the land.<br /><br />A very rich work, fully worthy for this to serve as a sequel to the equally powerful predecessor work, \\"The Pillars of the Earth.\\"
B004LWZW24|2.0|I'm an avid fan of scary movies. I like a good thriller as well.  The scene where the family permits the woman to try and make contact with their son whose spirit is trapped in what she called 'The Further\\" well I just about lost it when I saw her put that confound contraption on her face...it looked like a gas mask...attached to the mask was a 4 ft hose.. I about laughed out loud when I saw her male associate pick up the hose and attach it to his headphones...  this is a 21st century movie.. and this is what they come up with to contact the boy trapped in another dimension? ridiculous... don't buy the movie  rent it and see for yourself that it's a crappy movie.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|The theme is so simple and true that to express it briefly is to make it banal, but here goes: life puts you through a lot of changes, and then you die.    Egan expresses this theme through the structure of the book as much as through its plot: A Visit from the Goon Squad is comprised of a set of interlocking shorts, each of which features characters from some of the previous stories -- sometimes very minor characters -- thrust to center stage. Some of the characters do recur frequently, either as POV characters or as bit players in other people's stories, which allows us to see them at very different moments in their lives, and from very different narrator's perspectives. When we meet the character Sasha, for example, she's in therapy for her mostly-harmless kleptomania. We meet her again as the hyper-efficient personal assistant of a record executive. She is also the Patti Smith wannabe in the East Village nursing her drug-addled in-the-closet gay boyfriend through a suicide attempt. In the near future, she is the embarrassingly chipper suburban mother of a bunch of over-achieving children. I want to be clear: it's not that she had a series of strained, artificial epiphanies that made her go through all these changes. It's just that she went through changes, because that's what happens to people.    And then people die.    The prose is mostly unobtrusive and clear. That's rare these days in literary fiction. The only time I felt like Egan was showing off was in the chapter where she parodies David Foster Wallace. But I liked that chapter anyway. There's also the much-discussed PowerPoint chapter, too, but that felt necessary and right to me, given the POV character and the timeframe, rather than gimmicky.
B002NZUACI|5.0|Great book but the audio is read by the author and he tells stories at the end.  One of my very favorites.
B003W5C0VC|5.0|This movie ties in the entire series of Hannabal movies Staring Sir Antony Hopkins. This remake adds more to the story showing details only mentioned in \\"Man Hunter\\". Great movie to start out w/ only to be followed up by the rest of the series.
B004BSFC46|3.0|It rattles ok. I got some new ones from walmart that rattled so much better. The design and color are amazing. I have a chubby little two month old, and she only was able to fit in the wrist rattles for two weeks, and now they don't fit. If they were to fit longer, they would be amazing.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Very good movie.  I was very impressed with the special effects and so on.  This movie is a must see.
B0034G4P8K|5.0|i thought the action in this one was unbeleivable and just pure great. this is another movie that critics should just not give a review on. the acting is not the greatest but i am a fan of Labouf and the rest of the cast and i dont care what anyone else thinks but hes my favorite actor of my generation. this movie is mostly about the action the storyline is the same as the first two the dicepticons are trying to destroy the earth but Bay takes his skills to the next step and kicks some a** in these great CGI scenes. i wont go to far into it but this movie is something fun to watch where you root for the good guys thats it period i would love to see another one but i just dont see it happening Bay has said that himself but if he does do one wait a few years not two like the two before this one. GET THIS I WILL! TRANSFORMERS 3 RULES!!!
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I received my Mobee Wireless Charger today.  I unpacked it, set it up, and connected it to my computer via the USB interface. Within 2 minutes I started smelling this terrible smell of burning plastic. I looked at the charger, and the surface of the charger was starting to turn brown in one small area. I touched the brown area, and not only was it scorching hot, but is was also getting very soft and mushy.  The surface of the charging platform was melting. I immediately unplugged it, packed it up, and returned it.  This is a total piece of garbage and, I would argue, totally unsafe. Stay away.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Zack Synder might be a visual genious, but his movies are getting worse and worse. The plot was so so and a lot of new faces so you cant expect the acting to be great. Zack Snyder needs to go back to the roots of 300 and do better projects with quality story telling.
B002ZG975Q|3.0|I love the movie. It was ok to get from ED Movies. I should have know that since I got a used one it was going to have a lot of problems. There were scratches on the dvd and some of the parts were frezzing for only a second and one part of the movie keep repeating til I had to fast forward that part to get to the next part of the epsiode. But all and all it turned out well, played well, see well like new. And thank you of shipping it early when it was going to come in between July 18th-August2nd.    Thanks.
B004LWZW2E|4.0|Insidious is defined as operating or proceeding in an inconspicuous or seemingly harmless way, but actually with grave effect. This movie relies on the slow burn....cranking up your nerves with small jumps and tense music. It builds and builds, until it finally dumps a bucket of crazy on you. If you love good supernatural horror movies, then you know good ones don't come along very often. This movie caught me a little off guard. It's a jump inducing, butt puckering, scarefest with minimal hokiness. One of my favorites since Drag Me to Hell...
6304711905|5.0|Bought this dvd the same time I purchased Wyatt Earp. Needless to say he was also pleased with this one.
B000001FS3|4.0|This album may be their best album (Im between this album and Pop) Especially the first 4 songs are really amazing and their best songs ever. If you are new this is a good place to start. Im not a huge fan but in this album they make the difference. The rest songs are a little bit average, but overall its a good album to hear from start to the end. A must for U2 fans, and generally i recommend this album to all who likes pop cool music.
B004RLP1V6|5.0|July 1942 marked a dark period in the history of France where thousands of Jewish families were rounded up and forcibly kept in the Velodrome d'Hiver. They were then sent off to transit camps in France such as Drancy, before being packed off to Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp. What is disturbing about this whole incident is that the rounding up and mobilization of Jews for deportation was done by the French authorities.<br /><br />Based upon this seldom mentioned, little known piece of French history, author Tatiana de Rosnay has crafted a well-written novel that alternates between the past in 1942, and the present. The past centers around a 10 year old Jewish girl Sarah Strazynski who is forced to go to the Velodrome d'Hiver with her mother and father, innocently leaving behind a 4 year old brother Michel locked in a secret cupboard with the assurance that she would return to let him out when it was safe.<br /><br />The present revolves around writer Julia Jarmond, a transplanted American who is married to a frenchman and finds herself being consumed by the story of the Vel d'Hiv incident. As she digs deeper, she uncovers dark secrets surrounding her husband's family which are connected to the deportations of Jews from France. As the truth emerges, the author deftly handles the question of guilt caused by supressed secrets and how the truth can sometimes not only bring about pain and disrupt the regularity of life, yet also have the ability to heal and move forwards into the future.<br /><br />The method employed by the author, which alternates between the past [1942] and the present is an effective tool for it ties both periods together and brings the story to a satisfying conclusion. I do confess though that I found the story of the past much more dramatic and interesting than the one which deals with Julia in the present. On the whole though, it was an engrossing read and I would recommend it, especially to those interested in the genre. I'd also recommend the following books which deal with the Holocaust and France: \\"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews\\" by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction), \\"One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France\\" by Fred Gross (memoir), and \\"France:The Dark Years, 1940-1944\\" by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period).ith the Holocaust and France: \\"The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews\\" by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction), \\"One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France\\" by Fred Gross (memoir), and \\"France:The Dark Years, 1940-1944\\" by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period).
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Awesome new CD from the Classic-Prog rock band. I was very pleased to see that Trevor Horn and Geoff Downs were among the players. Interesting to note that the song \\" Fly From Here \\" was actually for the Drama CD, and was never used. A little rework was done and recorded. Great music............
0792163710|5.0|Alan Ladd stars as Shane in this wonderful, touching, western classic from 1953.  If this is not a 5-star film, there is no such thing as a 5-star movie!  This film meets and exceeds all expectations for being a classic.  There are so many memorable scenes, from the \\"Shane come back\\" tear-jerker by little Joey at the end of the film, to the axe-stump removal on the homestead with Shane and Big Joe attacking the stump together.  These are just two scenes of many which make up this remarkable and unforgetable film. The strong supporting cast of Jean Arthur (as Marian in the her last film of her career), Van Heflin (as the simple but trustworthy and strong Joe Sarrett), Brandon DeWilde (Little Joey), and Jack Palance (as the gunslinger/murderer Jack Wilson) give this film the fullness it deserves.  The plot is simple, the homesteaders simply want to farm their land and build a community, but the rancher barons will do anything to discourage them, to keep the range open, even killing the homesteaders to drive them out.  The rancher barons have guns and Wilson on their side, but the homesteaders have ex-gunfighter Shane.  The film comes to its dramatic conclusion when Shane faces down hired gunslinger Wilson and the ranchers in the town saloon, with the future of the homesteaders at stake.<br /><br />\\"Shane\\" is ranked 3rd on the American Film Institute's list of all-time classic westerns.  It is a film for the entire family to enjoy over and over again.  Director George Stevens crafted a true classic in this film.  It is truly a film for the ages.<br /><br />kone

B005869U6G|1.0|I have been listening to Incubus for years. I love the way S.C.I.E.N.C.E. sounded and Make Yourself, even Morning View and ACLOTM. But this new album is even more chill from Light Grenades and I feel truly loses the essence of Incubus. They used to be funkier and harder, and this new album feels like they are trying to be indie. I can't listen to it unless I am trying to fall asleep.     This review is not meant to be technically picking them apart, but from a long time Incubus fan, I feel like they have lost the sound that really made them who they were, they don't stand out anymore and seem to fall into the background white noise for me. Kilmore barely even uses the turntables, and I can not rock out to them anymore. If you are an old school Incubus fan, this album will most likely let you down and make you sad about the band you love. At least it did for me.
0451169514|5.0|I have read a large chunk of Stephen King's bibliography.  Some are excellent (The Talisman, Salem's Lot), some not so excellent (Carrie, Insomnia).  It is probably my favorite book of his (as of right now, he does seem to be getting better with age.)      At its core, the story is about a group of kids who have to confront an ancient evil as children and as adults.  A common King theme of ordinary people in extraordinary situations.  He does a great job of showing how the characters react when confronted with the evil as children and adults.      Some complaints have been raised about the characterization, but I felt that this group of characters were some of the strongest Stephen King characters he ever wrote.      If I have one complaint it would be the length of the story, it is not long enough!  At over 1000 pages I did not want to leave the world that King had created.      Bottom line: if you are familiar with King then you probably know how much enjoyment you will receive from reading this book.  As always he has good characters, interesting plot, and a mediocre conclusion.  If you have never read King before this is a fine place to start.  Don't be afraid of the length, it read much quicker than its size would suggest.
0811874192|5.0|I have a very large collection of pop-up books, and this is my absolute favorite. It can actually be used as a center-piece on a table.  I have it in the center of my living room coffee table and have received many compliments on it.  Each display of flowers is spectacular. Well worth the price, the book is simply stunning. It would be a great gift to give a friend so I'm sure I'll be buying more in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Though I had never heard of Collins nor the book before, I was surprised to see just how highly rated \\"The Hunger Games\\" was - and not disappointed at all. The book is of the same genre as \\"1984\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" but much more action oriented. A number of districts are forced to sacrifice a boy and a girl for a brutal annual game, organized by the Capitol to remind them of their defeat and unending subservience. You quickly get caught up in the emotions running through the key protagonist \\"Katniss\\", knowing that she might very well die at the very beginning of the games.<br /><br />While the book is meant for young adults (and sometimes reads that way), it's cuts quite deep into human nature. Collins does a great job of bringing out our darker sides, and how we can quickly turn a blind eye to atrocities - as long as we're not involved.<br /><br />A definite must - looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
1451629184|5.0|I live in Concord, which is where Jaycee was ultimately found. Her 18 years in the unfathomable living conditions were 15 minutes from me. She is my age. Yet where she is in her life is somewhere I cannot even imagine. However she has risen above all of the agony and horror to be a loving, smiling, and real woman. After watching her with Diane Sawyer and reading her story, I feel like I know her, I wish I did. Parts of this books made me almost sick, some made me so angry, and others filled me with happiness. It's a quick but eye opening read, and you will be a better person for reading it.
B0055D3EOG|4.0|OK, the pacing may have been a little off towards the end and the paranormal investigators perform a few comedy bits you've seen before.    However, Rose Byrne manages to portray a freaked out mother without replaying every other freaked out mother you've seen.  Patrick Wilson plays a vacuous, but amiable husband who just wants peace and quiet.  Barbara Hershey plays a very small part.  Lin Shaye gives the most comfortable performance - you've seen her in many movies - as a clairvoyant.  She did the best work of anyone.  The craftsman bungalow also plays a huge role in this movie - lots of running up and down those stairs.    Picture-wise, this is best seen on a TV instead of a small notebook LCD monitor - a lot of detailed dark shots.    As of July 2011, this and 'The Bleeding House' are my favorite online scary movie releases this year.

This is not a very difficult game, though there are some levels can be a challenge. I would have given this 5 stars but it crashes my phone quite often.  Maybe it's an issue with my phone (Epic 4G), but every so often while playing, the phone goes through a \\"reboot\\" cycle where it disconnects the antenna and remounts my micro sd card.

If you want a crash course in the institution of marriage, while also finding out what happened next in the author's life, read this book.

B0058U0EEO|4.0|'Life of Leisure' sounds like Ernest Greene spent tons of high hours in a bedroom (one with good sunlight) and might of accidentally produced a (short) masterpiece.  'Within and Without' might be described as the \\"professional\\" Washed Out.  There is planning heard here, writing rather than just playing around.  It is damned good, probably the best pop album of the year from the best pop artist out there.<br /><br />My ears hear an album that is decidedly European in sound.  Without a doubt a meeting ground between the haze of Slowdive and the crisp metro of New Order.  There is more emotion than previous releases; much more sorrow to be found here as opposed to the ethereal joy of previous releases.  Balearic influences (as much as he knew he had them) are far less pronounced.  The \\"island in the sun\\" or \\"by the pool\\" feeling is not constant.  'Within and Without' gives off more of an \\"indoor\\" vibe.<br /><br />Not a masterpiece, but a huge record of maturation.  That said, I must say that 'Within and Without' has produced a certifiable classic in the track \\"Eyes Be Closed\\".  This single is probably the best he's written, one of those songs that hits a place beyond mere emotions and touches on the triumph of just being alive.<br /><br />In ten years, I hope he makes his 'Avalon'.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Do your homework; read the Mystery Knight novella before reading Dance, and take notice of Sam's mention of a song called 'A Thousand Eyes and One' during a conversation with Maester Aemon in Feast. This is also fantasy for those who know their literature: MacBeth and Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast are alluded to throughout Feast, Dance, and the Mystery Knight. There's also just a little Julius Caesar, Romeo and Juliet, a walk of shame from Richard III, and maybe, just maybe, Titus Andronicus. Someone in Feast and Dance should remind you of Lady MacBeth, and if you imagine the three weird sisters rolled into one weird hag... Imagine Shakespeare's tragedies all shaken up with a strong dash of bitter, dark fantasy, but that's only for flavour. The story is uniquely Martin's own, despite its parallels to other fantasies. I would have to say this series is more for the type of reader who found James Clavell's Shogun books fascinating (especially Gai-Jin, Tai-Pan and Noble House).<br /><br />This series continues to expand and improve with each book; the world building never ends, and never gets old. I honestly do not understand the negative reviews for the last two books. This is high fantasy's masterpiece. Massive, twisted, and rewarding; not for the meek of mind, and not for short attention spans. (Does Tyrion shake the drops off a few too many times? Maybe. Only flaw...)<br /><br />Seriously, read the Dunk and Egg novellas. They enrich the series, especially the Bran and Jaime chapters in Dance. The history of Westeros' Blackfyre rebellion on the Redgrass, the Tragedy of Summerhall, and the characters tied together by these two events weave a web that underlies many of the events of ASOIAF, and can only be clearly seen through the novellas.<br />I would give this book a thousand stars (and one) if the rating went that high.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|Robocop is one of my favorite films. In futuristic crime plagued detroit, a cop is murdered by a gang of thugs, only to be brought back as a half-man half-machine to bring order to the mean streets of detroit. Other stuff gets old, but not this. I have seen this movie maybe 1,000 times. I could see it 1,000 more times and will not get tired of it
B005869U6G|5.0|I was not expecting a mellow record by Incubus at all!! I listened to the whole thing a few times and it grew on me. I appreciate when artists experiment with their sound and Incubus did just that. Stands out tracks for me are if not now, when, the original to name a few. Do not compare it to other albums by Incubus and you might like it as much as i did.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This is an amazing product. I love it so much. First of all, I had an issue with my 80 and 120g zune. The storage was amazing but just like the iPods it had no music quality unlike the 30g zune's with eq. Well anyways I figured I'd give this a try to improve mainly the bass on this because  neither my beats by dre Studios/ pro's  were working to boost up bass, but as soon as I got this, that quickly changed. Now every time I use this, it's Like you're in the club. No kidding. The sound quality improved by at least 30 to 35% it's really worth the money.
1594484805|5.0|Whether you're a parent, a teacher, a manager, or a leader you ought to read and try out some of the suggestions. If you're a salary worker, you might discover that there are different - and at least in my opinion - better ways of doing business: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.<br /><br />Though I fail to see how you can simply live the hedonistic  way, and only do, what you currently feel like doing, I do agree that providing workers with autonomy on how and when things are done - as long as they are done - greatly helps these in their work, and often leads to a better end result than what a slave would do. Those who do the work probably know better than the God-perspective architect the best layout of their workplace.<br /><br />If having the option of mastering something you like to do or just leaving at 'good enough' I think most people would chose the former.<br /><br />The book is well written, and drives the point home that most workers - especially those trying to be creative - are far better off at a looser level and less restrictions. As Fred Brooks mentioned: Some things you can't force, e.g. adding more women to a group of pregnant women will not speed up the birth.
B000F8O35U|1.0|I purchased the Little Mermaid movie from this vendor. In the description it said the movie was \\"New\\". I received it today and my 3 year old daughter was screaming with excitement to watch it. I opened it to find that both discs were scratched and seemed to have been watched many times. Frustrated but not wanting to disappoint my daughter,  I put the disc in and sure enough about 10 mins into the movie, it began to freeze and was skipping scenes. What a lousy way to make a buck. Did you really think we wouldn't notice that the discs were scratched?
031606792X|4.0|I just finished Breaking Dawn and have to say that it was not what I expected at all.  It is quite different from the other books (which were all good) in the series.  You just don't get the same romantic feel from this book that you do the others - whereas this one is just creepy and freaky from beginning to end.  Don't get me wrong - Bella and Edward still have their true love thing going throughout but it doesn't dominate the story in my opinion.  I really really liked the weird twists this story takes.  But ultimately its about the characters - and they are what have kept me coming back for more as I read this series.  The author does a really good job of writing likable characters and putting them in some incredible situations.  Four stars instead of five though, Stephanie - for having Charlie and Emmett watch a Gators college football game!  The Seminole Tribe wolves are not happy!!!

Some of the yield amounts seem to be a little off at times.
B000000H66|5.0|I love this album. But first off let me say this: Death is one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Right up there with Sabbath, Maiden, Priest and Slayer. Why? Every album they created is a 5 star masterpiece and you look at those other bands? They never achieved that. Simply stunning. Onward to the album, it is magnificent. Schuldnier is on fire on every track, Koeble and Conlon blaze and Hoglan is beyond remarkable. Every song is great but Crystal Moutain, the title track, empty words and 1000 eyes are some of the greatest metal songs I have heard.
1451626657|2.0|I decided to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of classic American literature--I didn't grow up in the US, so I hadn't read most of the books US students would have read in school. I was scratching my head over this book after several chapters and gave up on it after several more. It seemed to me that at the time it was written, the book may have been a powerful anti-war statement and perhaps an example of a writing style that hadn't been seen before, but I found it very dated, lacking context, and little more than a sequence of caricature vignettes and slapstick devices. Maybe I failed to appreciate it because I'm not American, though I have a decent knowledge of US history and I've been living in the US for more than a decade.
0307716511|4.0|Arabella Beatrice Hemming (Bee) is a young English woman and art designer living in New York with her fiancee. One day she receives a frantic call from her mother in London who says that her younger sister Tess has gone missing.  Bee takes the next available flight into London, even though she is not terribly concerned as her sister has always been a bit flighty.<br /><br />Soon after Bee's arrival, her sister is found dead in a abandoned public restroom; she has cuts on her arms.  We also learn that she has recently given birth to s stillborn baby.  The police are quick to rule Tess' death a suicide probably as a result of postpartum depression, but her sister Bee is certain that Tess did not commit suicide, but was murdered instead.<br /><br />Bee is determined to dig deeper into the life of her sister, and she discovers several things: Tess was receiving nuisance calls, she was seeing a married man who wanted nothing to do with the baby, and she was undergoing gene therapy because their brother died of Cystic Fibrosis.  If it was a murder, there could be several possible suspects.<br /><br />I loved the way this story unraveled. Bee was telling her sister what was happening. The characters were interesting, and the plot twists kept me guessing, something I enjoy in a good psychological thriller. It was also a story which showed the sometimes powerful bond between sisters, and between a mother and her daughters as well.  This was a very very good debut novel.  Lots going on that held my interest. Recommended.
0553801473|3.0|It sounds trite, but so many horrible things have happened and continue to happen that it tears my heart. It isn't just a matter of no happy endings. Where is the humor that used to bring us out of these horrible things? Can I just have ONE good thing happen in this story??? Some chapters (\\"Reek\\" comes to mind) are so full of pain and endless madness and suffering that they turn my stomach to read.<br /><br />I loved the previous books. But this one is too much.
B001O5EH3G|3.0|The album has lots of great songs and the DVD has some interesting material.

0670813028|5.0|This is Stephen King at the top of his game. What really stands out to me is that King is known as the master of Horror. Yet most of his best lay outside of that genre. The Stand is Fantasy,and The Dark Tower series is.... well a genre onto its own. This work though is like the Bible for Horror fans.<br /><br />The story is told from two different times. One as kids and then another as adults. So much drama stems just from this choice alone. By the end of this book these characters will be more like old friends than words on a page. And how many pages their are. This isn't a quick make a buck story. It is a huge sprawling tale that has a little something for everybody.<br /><br />I have read many horror novels and I have to say that this is one of the only ones to truly unnerve me. It has some frightening chunks that become all the more frightnening because you actually care what happens to them.<br /><br />So instead of my words let me show you a passage from this book. This is my favorite quite from any novel I have ever read. I promise reading it gives away no plot points.<br />\\"Friends.<br />They aren't any such thing as good friend or bad friend.<br />Maybe there are just friend.<br />People who stand by you when you're hurt and who helped you feel not so lonely.<br />Maybe there are worth being scared for and hoping for and living for.<br />Maybe worth dying for too.<br />If that what has to be.<br />No bad friends.<br />Only people you want.<br />Need to be with.<br />People who build their houses in your heart.\\"<br /><br />Constant reader will love this.
0679735909|3.0|This is from the most popular Amazon review of the book: \\"It's pretty hard not to be impressed with this thing, with its amazing scholarship and spectacular writing. [...] [S]o much so that you almost feel you have to genuflect before it every time you pick it up.\\" I don't remotely agree.<br /><br />While `Possession' is certainly impressive in some respects, it is clearly deficient in others. Let me start with the glaring insult to Americans. The ridiculously obvious villain in this book is Mortimer Cropper. Take a good look at his name. `Mort' is death (mortician, mortuary) and `crop' as a verb means to cut; in short he's the Grim Reaper. Let's look at Byatt's lack of subtlety in the first scene in which Cropper appears: he is wearing a \\"Black silk dressing gown,\\" over \\"Black silk pyjamas,\\" \\"mole-Black slippers,\\" and he \\"pushed down on a switch on his Black box.\\" (Capital \\"Bs\\" mine.) He had \\"American hips, ready for ... the faraway ghost of a gunbelt.\\" (American hips? There's her minor, separate, pot-shot at American gun laws.) Morty drinks Black coffee, and in case you are a dense American reader and still don't get it, \\"His car was a long black Mercedes ... a swift funereal car.\\" So there's Cropper, death driving a hearse.<br /><br />That's not the insult. The insult is that Cropper, backed by tons of American money, is busy buying up all the \\"relics\\" of fictitious Victorian poet Randolph Ash as though the material items that belonged to Ash were more important than the poetry he wrote. This is Byatt's way of saying Americans are not very bright (Cropper is a scholar don't forget) and easily mistake the image for the thing itself, are so dazzled by gold foil wrapping they forget to analyze the contents of the box. It's a clumsy perpetuation of a stereotype--one that Kazuo Ishiguro brilliantly annihilated in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. Byatt's hero, lowly Roland Mitchell, says at least twice how he's not interested in Ash's personal belongings, just in what Ash wrote. One just wants to reach into the book and pat him on the head.<br /><br />To be sure, Cropper's Scottish counterpart, James Blackadder (a double-sided name I'll let you ponder for yourselves) doesn't come off particularly favorably, but he's the under-funded underdog against the rich American. And while both men have subsumed their identities under Ash's, have devoted their lives to someone else's work rather than producing original work of their own, Cropper is clearly the more reprehensible of the two: \\"Maud decided she intuited ...\\" notice the clunkiness of the phrase by the way ... does Maud really need to decide to intuit? How about: Maud intuited \\"something terrible about Cropper's imagination .... He had a peculiarly vicious version of reverse hagiography\\" [note the cheap repetition of the letter V]:\\"the desire to cut his subject down to size.\\" Precisely what `crop' means, of course.<br /><br />Do I want to \\"genuflect\\" in front of this text? Hardly. While Byatt does an admirable job with recreating Victorian letters and Victorian poems--really first rate--the actual story suffers. There are so many poems, so many letters the narrative never gains much momentum. Every time you think the story is going to go somewhere, she throws a 10-page poem at you or 20 pages of letters. They bog the story down interminably.<br /><br />As for the \\"spectacular writing,\\" it's all reserved for the Victorian recreations. There's nothing particularly impressive about the sentences that convey the contemporary story; there's a lot to be desired in fact. Here's an example: \\"A very small woman appeared .... She wore a large apron covered with purple and grey florets, over a skinny black jumper. She had a small hard, brown-skinned face under white hair drawn into a bun.\\" A very unimaginative piling up of 5th-grade adjectives: colors, small (twice!), large, and that's about it. The writing is workmanlike, competent, but hardly better.<br /><br />Or \\"The librarian fetched a checkedduster, and wiped away the dust, a black, thick, tenacious Victorian dust, a dust composed of smoke and fog particles accumulated before the Clean Air Acts.\\" [p. 5] Do we really need this repetition of dust? We certainly don't need the comma after \\"duster,\\" which is just mispunctuation. Don't we call black dust \\"composed of smoke particles\\" soot? (And fog is not composed of anything solid; it's water vapor.) This is just unnecessary hyperbole and repetition.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that Byatt throws Freud and Lacan into the novel, in spite of the fact that it's set in academia, giving her the freedom to wallop us with an interesting theory or two, Byatt gives us little more than a few tired lines discounting penis envy. All these professors and textual critics and not a single interesting idea that I could find in this novel. It is mainly an exercise in contrivance--albeit expertly executed contrivance.<br /><br />So Byatt has done well forging a believable pair of poets from the 19th century but failed to give us realistic counterparts. She excels at imitation but, like her villains, has nothing original to convey.ck, tenacious Victorian dust, a dust composed of smoke and fog particles accumulated before the Clean Air Acts.\\" [p. 5] Do we really need this repetition of dust?

0553582038|4.0|Where this book really suffers from is a motif that runs throughout this book. It invovles a whole portion of the book being told through different peoples perspectives each time you return to it. What this does is that you never really start to care about any of these one and done characters. Worse than that you become annoyed everytime you get to one of these chapters. It is like the brakes get slammed every other couple of chapters.<br /><br />The other problem is that half the characters are gone. This story is at it's best when the characters we love are either heading into, in, or reeling from the aftermath of a battle. With half (some could argue the best)of the characters missing then you don't get that play off eachother thing that is so effective in the other books.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad novel as some would have you believe. This playground of Martin's is just so much fun. He is to talented to not make the proceedings boring. Another note is that you are to treat this as half a book. Until you finish A Dance with Dragons you have not completed the arc that this story has in store. A really encouraging thing is that the last third of the book really gets good. You may be a little annoyed at parts but he will get you back if you trust him.

B00559B9N8|5.0|Not a lot of writers would be brave enough to pen a love story between a girl-turned-old-lady and a wizard missing a vital organ.<br /><br />But fantasy dowager Diana Wynne Jones was one of those brave enough to write such a story -- and not only does she succeed, but she creates a brilliantly charming story. It's crammed with complex magical conspiracies, unlikely heroines, dimension-hopping, curse and contracts, and some sly subversions of the usual fairy tale tropes (such as good things only happening to the youngest).<br /><br />A misunderstanding leads to ordinary Sophie Hatter being turned into a crone by the malevolent Witch of the Waste. Finding old age oddly liberating, she wanders away from her hat shop, and becomes the cleaning lady for the powerful wizard Howl, who lives in a moving castle with his fire demon Calcifer. Calcifer strikes a deal with Sophie -- if she can break the contract between him and Howl, he'll restore her youth. The catch is, neither he nor Howl can tell her WHAT the contract is.<br /><br />While assisting Howl and his apprentice Michael, Sophie discovers that Howl's reputation for wickedness is rather exaggerated -- he doesn't actually eat girls' hearts and suck out their souls, but he is a prodigious flirt who abandons girls once he gets them to fall for him. He's also kind of a drama queen. But soon Sophie finds that the powerful wizard is ensnared in a horrifying curse -- and Howl has only a little time before the curse strikes.<br /><br />One of Diana Wynne Jones' favorite sources of humor was poking fun at the tropes of fantasy and fairy tales.  If you've ever read a fairy tale -- &#34;Cinderella,&#34; &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34; -- you'll know that the youngest kids are always the pure-hearted ones destined for great things. So Jones obviously had a lot of fun with this idea, and uses it as the jumping-off point for &#34;Howl's Moving Castle.&#34;<br /><br />Along the way, she peppers her novel with a complicated, intertwined conspiracy that Sophie only discovers as she spends more time with Howl, involving a curse (&#34;“Go and catch a falling star/Get with child a mandrake root...&#34;), a lost prince, and the Witch of the Waste. The curse's slow unveiling creates a growing sense of dread without revealing much, except the awareness that something terrible is rising slowly.<br /><br />But it's handled in a fun, tongue-in-cheek way, with Sophie having to deal with Howl's immaturity (he has a green slime attack when his hair is dyed ginger) as well as the woes associated with magic (the seven-league boots). And Jones clearly had some fun throwing odd twists into the mix.<br /><br />Sophie is a rather timid, dull character until her unexpected aging sets her free from her unhappy life. Her sensible, assertive new self is a pretty entertaining heroine, especially as she starts feeling both exasperation and romantic interest in Howl.  Howl is a delightful character -- he's fickle, immature, flamboyant, eccentric, irresponsible and has cultivated a distinct image as a wicked, heart-devouring sorcerer to keep everyone far away from him. And yet, he's oddly charming and fun to read about, especially as a foil to the sensible Sophie.<br /><br />Moving castles, fire demons and an oddly charming wizard make &#34;Howl's Moving Castle&#34; an absolute must-read -- especially for those who like their complicated fantasies to be a little tongue-in-cheek.ends more time with Howl, involving a curse (&#34;“Go and catch a falling star/Get with child a mandrake root...&#34;), a lost prince, and the Witch of the Waste.

B000Y5JFN4|2.0|Comedies in general are a strange lot; they rarely if ever retain their comedic value over time as they age poorly being mostly a sendup or a reflection of the times they were made.  There are countless comedies that literally made me roll on the floor with laughter but after subsequent viewings years later barely raised a chuckle out of me.  Thankfully there are a few truly classic films from the genre that still retain or even exceed their comedic value over time but these are few and far between.  \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" though especially for those who are musicians or who follow the 80s rock scene closely never fails to amuse and this is mostly due to the excellent performances of Guest, McKean, Shearer and even director Reiner who is an excellent comedic actor in his own right.  It was also nice to see Fran Drescher putting in a great performance before she achieved worldwide fame as \\"The Nanny\\".<br /><br />Too bad this blu ray release doesn't live up to the quality of its content; the picture quality can be described as only slightly better than standard dvd in too many frames and I have many standard DVDs that look better.  There are two discs but the content on the second disc barely reaches 15 minutes in length suggesting they could have just put everything on one disc or they could have added more and better Special Feature documentaries on the second disc.  Sadly we get neither here.  The sound quality on DTS HD MA 5.1 surround sound is good except for the very irritating fact that when the band plays, the sound level goes up so high but it goes back down again when the dialogue resumes which is very bothersome when you find you have to quickly adjust the volume whenever this transition is made.<br /><br />Many fans already have this film in various guises i.e. VHS, DVD, LD etc and so MGM/Fox have to ask themselves what would make fans want to double dip?  As this release is only a slight if I am being generous improvement to the DVD release I am left extremely disappointed and I now wish I had waited for a worthier blu ray release before double dipping.  How about a digibook with much better restored picture quality and a better adjusted sound volume levels for both the music and dialogue parts?  This is not the first Studio Canal release that is subpar and I guess I should have known better instead of taking a chance on this release given how poorly other Studio Canal blu ray releases have been in the past e.g. Kurosawa's \\"Ran\\".<br /><br />This is a great comedy that is still very funny today and will probably still be so for years to come but if you already have this on dvd it is not worth the double dip.

B000003EPN|5.0|What a beautiful voice she had in her prime, lovely, caressing, liquid and rich.      Verdi is one of my favorite Italian opera composers and who could sing his herione's better than Moffo. Maybe loosing his daughter so young Verdi always wrote beautiful arias for the herione. THe early/mid 60's finds Moffo at her peak in power, richness and control.  This recording is one of my favorites of hers.  There are many other versions out there, more up to date with digital sound but I always find myself comparing it to this version.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|After going through several inexpensive cases, I didn't have high expectations for this product. I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. It fits my white iPhone 4 perfectly and doesn't really tarnish its looks. The protection, while obviously not on the level of Otterbox, is good. The screen protector is solid and the packaging was a breeze.    If you're mostly careful with your iPhone, but want some peace of mind without sacrificing the iPhone's looks then this is an excellent case to consider. If you're clumsy and looking for the sturdiest protection then I'd suggest look at an Otterbox Defender.    Bottom line -- this is an inexpensive case that looks great and provides decent protection.

0670019933|5.0|The Dharma Bums has the Jack Kerouac style that On the road carried, but is faster paced than the authors most famous work.  The themes are drastically different also, On the Road being a sensualist's dream, and Dharma Bums being the down to earth maturity that came from years of living on the road.  Nature is a key factor in the book, its no Walden but the way Kerouac intertwines nature, Buddhism and the American dream is a very entertaining read.  I would recommend this book over On the Road simply because it is shorter and blends a variety of things that are uncommonly seen together.  The only difficulty was having to look up a few terms in regard to the eastern religions, but even that doesn't detract from the flow of the book.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked On the Road, and if you haven't read any Kerouac, this is a good place to start.
0670022411|1.0|This book is terrible.  It doesn't flow, the \\"historical\\" aspect is uninspired, questionable and feels like it was pasted in to give the book some sort of credibility or merit and the romance aspect is unexpected, unecessary, boring, flat and repetitive (to the point you start skipping passages).  I was very disappointed in this book.  After perusing the cover a few times at the book store, I bought it.  I would like my money back. I wish I had opened the book itself and read some of it.  I wouldn't have wasted a dime on this book.  Please Ms. Harkness, spend some time writing a story, not trying to include every genre you can think of.  The story itself could have been good if you had devoted time to story development rather than throwing out a shoddy piece of work that seems to be all over the map.  Your editor should be fired.  No thanks here.
0071762345|5.0|An excellent book for those looking to get started in social media, gain a better understanding of it, or understand why it is important. The examples that Kerpen gives are spot on as to the value that lies in the new, but oh so old, form of interaction.<br /><br />At its base, social media is not much different than all the communication that we have all been doing for years; that the human race and consumers have been doing forever. What is different about it is the immediacy, the permanence, and the reach. Kerpen illustrates this very well with examples of how social media has been used to help companies and causes, or ignored to the peril of those on the wrong end.<br /><br />As one saying goes about social media, \\"your customers are already talking about you, don't you want to be part of that conversation?\\" Likeable Social Media helps you to understand how to be part of that conversation without being a pushy salesperson or an overpowering know-it-all. You want to be liked. You want to be the person that others gather around at the cocktail party instead of the one they all avoid.<br /><br />You don't have to read this book cover to cover, in fact your don't even have to read the chapters in order. In that way it is a great desk or bedside reference to just pick up from time to time to get a quick bit of inspiration.<br /><br />If social media bewilders you at all, this book is highly recommended.
B000002UY5|5.0|Great album from a band I knew of but never cared to listen to until this past year. This album, Soup and Nico are all classics.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|This isn't to review the Gilmore Girls Series.  Obviously I liked that enough to buy the complete collection!  My problem, much like other reviewers, is the packaging.  It is shoddy to say the least.  I have had numerous (5-8) disks nearly ruined because the pockets that they fall into covered the DVDs with glue which would not play in my blu ray player.  I had to struggle to pull the DVDs out of the pockets and then again to put them back in because of the glue issue.  Aside from that and the, lets face it, ugly packaging I have no issues with the DVD playback.   I gave it three stars because I couldn't give this 2 stars seeing as the DVDs play well and I love the story, but if I could only grade the packaging I would give it 2.
B005869U6G|1.0|Come on, Incubus! You guys used to be cool. Kind of embarrassed to have ever loved your earlier albums after this most recent disaster. Please stop perpetuating the downfall of original rock music in America and try a little harder next time!
B004Y1USJE|5.0|This is not for Bob Seger or John Mellencamp fans. This is talented sophisticated powerful melodic music for those who need more than three chords and 4/4 time signatures to keep their ears happy.   I admit, the first time I heard this, I was not that impressed, but there is so much music on this disc, it can go over your head the first time. Listen and be patient like I did and you will be so rewarded.   Squire's using his Rick with awesome bass lines. Howe is writing overlapping melodies that fight and blend beautifully. David's voice sounds more like Horn than Jon, so what? I love Jon, but David's voice does just fine and change can be good.   This is more a 70's style CD than an 80's CD. Lots going on that can mean a lot of listening discovery, and for me, a total and wonderful addiction. The more you listen, the more you want to.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I met Chris Squire at Best Buy last year (Hi Chris! How's the Macbook?) who invited me back stage to meet the band after the concert at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center that night. It was an energy packed concert, and meeting the band convinced me they have so much left in the tank. They are very in-tune with their fanbase and love what they do. I have seen them live twice since then and I think they are doing a magical thing by keeping Yes going. Last year they performed Close to the Edge in its entirety!    Yes, the ratings will increase for this album with time. I am a huge fan of the Proggiest records from the 70's including Tales from Topographic Oceans, Going for the One, and Relayer. I am also 23 years old.    This album takes a few listens to \\"get\\", even for the most die-hard Yes fans. If you give it a chance, you will find it to be an exceptional Yes release. The first time I heard it, I was confused between the progressive and pop aspects to this album. But, now I find it to be one of their most charming and beautiful albums.     The 22 minute epic is extremely high quality. I feel like this will cater to those who love their 70's prog albums and appreciated their Drama and 90125 albums. This may sound strange, but it plays by a lot faster than their other 20+ minute epics. It just seems to me that there is so much substance to this song that it flows by so quickly. Along the way you ascend, float, fall down, are picked up, dusted off, then ascend and float again. It is quite a fun ride indeed, and for me the best thing they've done since Drama.    \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me\\" to Be is a very brilliant Chris Squire-penned song. If you've ever heard Fish Out of Water, you know what I'm talking about. This song contains many hair raising moments for me, and possibly is the best song on the album. Great bass playing and singing by Chris. Probably the best song for me since Tempus Fugit. Positive and uplifting.    Steve Howe highlights the next few tracks \\"Life on a Film Set\\", \\"Hour of Need\\", \\"Solitare\\", and \\"Into the Storm\\". He basically gives a guitar workshop.    Thanks Chris and crew for putting out such a brilliant album. One thing I need to mention is Geoff Downes, who really fits with this band. He and Steve Howe have a chemistry that Alan White and Chris Squire have. That's a really good thing.    To be honest, when they announced the album I expected another Ladder or Magnification where you get an okay Yes album and just wish it had a little more energy and strong writing. Upon the first listen I was proven wrong. There are many hair raising moments on this album. As Yes fans, isn't that what we live for? The peak of the beginning of \\"The Revealing Science of God\\", the buildup to the end of \\"Awakening\\", and where \\"The Gates of Delerium\\" peaks towards the end of the track. There are moments to this album that gave me goosebumps like those songs do in a still proggy but more modern way.    This is the first time since 1983 where they've sounded like they are really going for the one.    Essential for all Yes fans.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I am sure it is just coincidence, but this week's Gospel in Church is about how an enemy has sown weeds into the field of the Master's wheat (see Mt 13:24-43). I think one of the messages of the reading(s) is \\"patience\\" with the world, with others, and with ourselves. Frequently, we are little aware of the weeds that have taken root in our lives, although we are quick to see them in others. All the while the weeds can have a dominating affect on the good we also possess.<br /><br />I was reminded how this movie is a good example of this message & more. Michael Ober had more than a few negatives overshadowing his life. The Touhy family, especially in the form of Sandra Bullock, was able to see the good, in spite of all else, and enable Michael not only to look past it, but to excel. Most already know the ending before watching the movie: success in the form of college, scholarship, All-American and NFL. Not bad for someone who was abandoned only years prior.<br /><br />In this true story, credit must be given to John Lee Hancock for his great directing. I suppose the final product would not be what it is without great editing also (mentioned in other reviews). I found Sandra Bullock an essential ingredient in the movie. She was terrific! I never saw her in such a role, but her acting does the job. It is an incredible film: with all the anguish & excitement!
B004LWZWE2|4.0|Great concert film featuring the Bon Squad at the height of their powers.  The remaster on the audio and video is a noticeable improvement  on the original footage.  The concert is excellent and the other footage is okay, with a goofy voice-over interviewer that somehow has some 1970s charm.    The 4-star review is because of the bonus features, which are not bonus at all.  I'm in agreement with the Richardson \\"Clarence\\" review that the parade of usual VH1 \\"Remember the 70s\\" talking heads add very of value to a true fan who would shell out $40 for the limited edition.  They really missed the mark on the special features... they could have interviewed roadies, fans, management, or just about anyone else.  When Scott Ian or Billy Corgin talked about Angus' gear or playing style, they could have easily had a guitar in hand and demonstrated it.  The special features were filmed cheaply and with no imagination at all.    DON\\"T BUY THE LIMITED EDITION unless you really want the tin can.  But enjoy the hell out of the performance!
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Not for kids but that aside it is action all the way. If you can stand up to that m e a n look from Danny Trejo without running home to momma you will be entertained. You'll get a slice of a man betrayed but willing to battle it out on his own terms with a little help from unlikely sources.It's packed with laughter too.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Works very well and gets amazingly clear sound.  Really like the built in card reader / usb slot feature.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|This is an excellent DVD.  For those who like future projections, this could be a possibility.  This was exciting to watch and the story line is pretty good too.  I was not disappointed.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|The acting from both of these \\"beautiful people\\" actors is top shelf. The story is a good one, and well-portrayed characters were extremely essential to it. Superb - I completely enjoyed this.
B003Y5H51K|3.0|I bought the dvd on the reputation of the executive Producer, James Cameron.  I realize also that it is based on true events.  I have a fascination of the caving phenomena, but ended up disappointed.    Who would want to go caving in a remote place, after watching this Movie!
B004WN96ME|3.0|This box set had the potential to do a lot of things for collectors, however it does not deliver. Sure, it does have five discs, but the first three are the same material, just mastered by different folks at different times. Disc one is \\"the original album remastered 2011\\", Disc two is \\"the 2004 remaster\\" and Disc Three is the Randy Burn's remixes from 2004.  On these first three discs,only 4 tracks are sort of \\"new\\" because they were not released 4 of the Randy Burn's mixes were not released. Disc four is a live show from 87, which could have been cleaned up a bit better.  Finally, disc five is just the 2011 remix and the live show on a DVD-rom as wav files. That disc could have been left out, becaue most folks can and do make their own wav or mp3 files, not a real additional value.  I really wish the 5th dvd disc would have been an actual recording of a live show from the 1987 era. That would have been a thing to have on hand and added value to the set.  I really do like the vinyl that was included with this, 3 lp's first being the 2011 remaster album, and the second and third being the live show.  They are on black, grey-white, and clear vinyl, a nice addition.  The added 20 page booklet is really nothing special, just has liner notes from Dave and from Lars Ulrich. For the price it should have been hard bound.  The ticket, two fliers, two pictures, and folder are neat, finishing off what could have been a really nice box set. The outer box is excellent though, 3-d hollograph, very nice.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fair box for completists, like myself. For a lighter Megadeth fan, the 2 disc version contains all the true \\"new\\" material on the live disc.  If this would have been priced about 75-80 bucks, this would have gotten 4 stars from me, but the price and effort put forth in this drags it down to a three for me.
B004Y1USJE|5.0|After ten years, Yes has reformed in a new line up on this studio album. It is very tight with great harmonies.  The Horn/Downes writing team did a much better job than on Yes' Drama album.  But in my opinion, there was not enough material, we need another album real soon.  Benoit David, blends his voice very well with the other members of the band, I guess after two years performing live, Yes has re-invented themselves once again.
B001DF68MA|5.0|The wee rider was very easy to assemble on to the bike and my toddler fits perfect in the bike seat.  My toddler loves riding in the wee rider.The wee rider is well constructed and stable on the bike.  I would recommend this product.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|It was fun watching this one.  Arnold's being himself, acting wise, the machine part was the best.  Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton did great performances, a classic.
0385732554|5.0|This slight volume is so well written, so thoughtful, so well developed, that it is a small jewel of a book.
B003XQG0JI|5.0|I loved this album.  Brought me back to my younger days.  If you like the Corrs, you'll love this one.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I always keep meaning to write reviews. I read so many reviews that often help me immensely in making a purchase decision.    Well if you are looking for a really good movie I can't recommend this one enough. But if you are someone who would rather watch an action movie with no plot and nothing but computer generated special effects then you might not enjoy it. However, if you enjoy great acting and a movie that makes you feel emotions when you watch it then it might be for you!    I rarely have tears in my eyes when I watch movies...but it seemed to happen a lot in this movie. I guess I am a very empathetic person and so many times I felt like I was feeling what she felt and many times I felt what it must of been like to be her mother. Such a remarkable story. Easily the best movie I have seen in years!
B004UQPM4E|5.0|All I can say is wow, this is a great collection.  From the old cartoons to deleted scenes this is a great box set for any true super fan!  I had the previous set, but BluRay makes all the difference!
B003XU02QG|4.0|I must say, i really didnt care for the main antagonist, whom i wont reveal here. Lets just say that there is no way that person defeats a warrior with superior training and experience in single combat. At least, i dont see it truly happening. The person in question repeatedly kicks a bit more ass than you figure could really happen. That part was pure Hollywood.<br />However, the story itself was pretty cool. Essentially, the Ninth Legion gets wiped out and the seven survivors try to first, rescue their general, and then make their way out of enemy territory, which they find themselves pretty deep into. The primary protagonist is a fully honorable soldier, but some of his companions are arguably less so. However, since their survival is tied to one another, they have to get along. The really cool aspect of the story in my opinion is the depiction of them basically jogging/running everywhere. Want to get somewhere in the olden days and you dont have a horse, you gotta run. That really stuck with me as a very good plot device as well as exhibiting quite a bit of realism.<br />You will have recognized a few of the actors elsewhere, but the most recognizable were the boyfriend from the first two seasons of Dr Who, and Dominic West.<br />Anyway, i will refrain from describing too much else about the movie, but it is an overall enjoyable experience.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I found this to be a sort of updated Poltergeist. While not a true reboot, it does have some of the same mix. A small child caught up in an unknown \\"otherworld\\", 2 parents and 2 siblings left to deal, a trio of experts to help the family out, and in the end a parent goes in to retrieve the child.<br />Now I'm sure others will question my analogy, but it's how I saw things.<br />As for the movie, it has a nice spooky element to it that sets the pace all the way through. Small things at first leading up to many more unexplained happenings. The scares were not in your face, although there were a few well placed got ya moments! Overall I enjoyed this movie and consider it one of the better horror movies to come out in recent years. I will be buying the blu ray version as it does have a few special features not on the DVD.
B0016OVEYA|5.0|Okay, this movie has been reviewed to death, so i thought i would take a different tac with mine. I recently debated the merits of this movie with a friend of mine online. He said that it was one of the best, worst movies of all time, meaning that it was a horrible movie that you just couldn't help but watch whenever it comes on. My response was as follows:<br /><br />\\"I actually wouldn't call Starship Troopers a terrible movie at all. If you consider that it was a Heinlein magazine serial in 1959 written (the actual story name was \\"Starship Soldier\\", and was published in \\"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\\") that was then published as \\"Starship Troopers\\" in novel form at the end of that year (won a Hugo award also). It was written as a response to a newspaper advertisement in 1958 placed by National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, calling for the unilateral suspension of nuclear weapon testing by the U.S.. Heinlein actually founded a group in support of nuclear weapons testing, and then wrote his stories.<br /><br />So....considering the background of the story, and the fact that Verhoeven kept the movie honest to the book and its intent, which included a very heavy depiction of how propaganda campaigns can shape or threaten to shape national policy and the public mindset and/or acceptance of policies, i would say the movie was actually quite brilliant.<br /><br />It brought the innocence of the time period it was written in to life while telling an outrageous counter propaganda tale of why we need to arm ourselves more heavily as opposed to ridding ourselves of armament.<br /><br />p.s. I had a band once called \\"Games & Theory\\" back in 1998-1999. Can you guess where we got that name from?\\"
0143038419|1.0|It took me over 6 months to complete reading this book. It was recommended to me since I was going to the Italian Alps to ski. I felt no connection to the author. In fact I regret purchasing this book. I wish I would have used my library card for this read.
B0041VT6HW|2.0|I thought it notable that Josh Brolin was embarrassed by this movie, and he is the star. It is more of an eye candy flick, with enough violence and shots of prostitute playing Megan Fox, but other than that, the movie was lackluster at best. This was not the best effort from Malcovich, who is really a fine actor in most movies i've seen him in, IMO. The action seemed a bit too contrived, the humor forced, the story gutted. Not at all the way to pay homage to the comic book series.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Three friends have horrible bosses. For one reason or another they are stuck at their jobs. Nick works for Kevin Spacey who is a ridiculous driver and badgers Nick when he is 2 minutes late. Kurt works a chemical company. His new boss is a coke head who sees the business as an ATM machine and wants to run it into the ground. When he says he wants to \\"trim the fat\\" that means he wants to fire fat people. Dale, who is engaged, is a dental assistant to Jennifer Aniston, who wants to have sex with him. Even his close friends have trouble believing that is a problem.<br /><br />Kurt claims killing his boss, who wants to dump waste on the proverbial poor Bolivians would save lives and that they have a moral duty to kill their boss. Jennifer Aniston develops a comical potty mouth in this film, one that makes Madonna sound like Mother Teresa.<br /><br />After some very brief soul searching our trio decides life would be better without their bosses. However getting to that point is not easy. The movie takes some unexpected twists. The role of Dale (Charlie Day) was clearly written with Zach Galifianakis in mind. In spite of that, this was still an excellent movie. Good laughs, and an enjoyment to see Aniston as \\"R\\" rated.<br /><br />F-bomb, crude sex talk (mostly by Aniston)
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|You know, at first, i was hesitant to watch this show. Another crime drama? I mean, how many NCIS, CSI's and Law & Orders do we really need? However, i knew that Nathan Fillion was in it, so i TEVO'd a few episodes. I still hemmed and hawed, until finally, i gave in to curiosity and gave it a go. What i realized is that this was really a stellar show. Unlike the other crime drama's out there, this show really makes a point of not taking itself too seriously. While it deals with serious topics, it also is good for quite a few laughs in every episode. The interplay between Fillion and Katic is awesome, and the rest of the cast is perfect as well. So, a few episodes into the first season, once i actually watched them, and i was hooked. Plus, if you really pay attention, you'll find a reference to Firefly in every episode...the writers and/or directors tribute to Fillion himself, who is arguably one of the more beloved actors in this generation.<br />The first season is a must for any collection.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|Cameron Diaz plays an extremely self-centered individual who is looking for a rich man to marry after her fiancee dumped her because she was a gold digger. (She claims she caught him with the dog and peanut butter.) Teaching junior high gets in her way as she \\"needs\\" augmentations to be able to compete with all those Barbie Dolls out there. She uses movies to babysit her class. The gym teacher is interested in Cameron (she don't date gym teachers). Cameron in turn has her eyes on a nerdy substitute teacher (Justin Timberlake) whose family comes from money. He however likes Amy Squirrel.<br /><br />Meanwhile in class there is a student who could be a young self centered Diaz who badgers a boy who shows her interest, sort of a parallel to her \\"miserable\\" life. Lucy Punch plays Amy Squirrel (as a red head) an overly perky teacher who becomes Diaz's school nemesis. Diaz helps the junior high car wash using moves she learned watching Paris Hilton commercials, pocketing some of the money for her \\"t#t jar.\\"<br /><br />The movie changes gears when Cameron finds out the teacher whose class gets the best test scores gets a bonus. The outrageous practices of Diaz both as an apathetic and serious teacher is the core of the movie.<br /><br />F-bomb, nudity(not Diaz or Punch), crude sexual humor, Timberlake dry humping Diaz, bad music, worse poetry, and Lincoln rolling over in his grave.
B0055D3EOG|3.0|First I would have to say that I am an avid horror movie fan. I enjoy the gore and the mental scares. I enjoy everything from \\"The Birds\\" to \\"LeatherFace\\" to \\"Twilight Zone\\". Here's why I gave it 3 stars:    #1: For me, the art cover of this movie is misleading. Because, well without giving the whole story away, the boy on the cover is actually not that much in the movie. -2    #2: The first half of the movie reminded me of Paranormal Activity (which I dislike and was a HUGE disappointment). The second half is where the actual action starts. But the only scares are the cheap loud music tempos and the pop-up shots of scary characters. You know the ones that pop up real quick in front of the camera to try and scare you like the ones in a haunted house. +1    #3: I would say that this was an okay rental but definitely NOT a purchase. I was very interested after I saw the previews and rent some of the reviews here. It made it seem like it was a mix of the Poltergeist and Exorcist. But unfortunately, I would rather consider it a mix between Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. +1    #4: I think if the director/writers really applied themselves to this movie, it could've been an awesome mental thriller - one that everyone would remember and would have been part of their Halloween routine. -2    #5: I would just like to also add that this movie should not be viewed by children. Simply because they do not understand how astral projections work and may try to experiment with it not only causing damage to their selves but to others. If you do decide to allow your children to watch them, please explain to NOT COPY what they are seeing. It is very dangerous and very real.
0553386816|5.0|I have each and everyone of his books and treasure each and everyone of them. You and count on John Grisham's wit and suspense. Please keep creating your books we look forward to each and every story you put on paper.
B001AEF6D6|3.0|A Movie I don't think I would watch again,despite watching it before and then a 2nd time, not because I couldn't understand it or wanted to but because I just did. I really Like John Goodman and Love his potrayal in this movie and while I am not a Jeff Bridges Fan I did like his Hippie Potrayal in this movie.(They all are smelly lazy), I also liked buscemi's role too.(Donny!)I think this movie is for those who enjoyed Fargo and those type of movies,My favorite quote though is \\"Say what you want about National Socialism at least it's got an Ethos.\\".So the movie is entertaining to an extent,I hate the smashing up of the Vette.
B00005K3O4|5.0|I remember this movie bieng shown on late night cable TV a lot in the early 90's. I thought it was crazy and cool at the same time. I love the bonus features included on the disc. I was always wondering how they did a lot of the visual effects. The home movie made by the filmaker's as kids was nice too. Nothing wrong with a little creativity!
B004RSCWZ2|1.0|This cd is exactly what's wrong with music today. There is not one original note sung or played on this. The sub-Bonnie Raitt stylings of Susan Tedeschi were boring 10 years ago and even more so today (Grace Potter falls into this category as well). Yes Derek can play. But it's all so similar and unoriginal that two songs in you reach for the delete button. And having the songs written by committee is silly. Where is that band that is gonna come out of nowhere and turn the music world on its ear?? This ain't it. Good luck keeping an 11-piece band alive in this industry in 2011. Back to the drawing board kids.......
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a movie the whole family could enjoy. It was full of adventure and comedy.   Totally enjoyable movie!   A must add to everyone's collection.
0553801473|4.0|There is a terrific novel in here but like the last few books it is buried and strangled with the glacial pace and extraneous bits that clutter it up. Also like the last books there is no attempt to have a book that stands on it's own with a beginning, a middle and an end. We are left abruptly with no resolution to the story or most of the characters.<br /><br />Given the amazing breadth of plot and deep character development and the fabulous and richly fleshed out world that has been developed maybe I am being too picky? But I feel as if some talented editor could go through and help make this much tighter and faster moving book. But while I am gripping about the pacing and lack of resolution there can be no question about the brilliance of the author's creation. I am speechless with admiration about his willingness to brutally eliminate favorite characters in keeping with the nature of the world he has created which has allowed this series to avoid the boring predictability and tiredness that so many series fall into as the same lead characters have the same kinds of adventures over and over.<br /><br />I may be complaining but I am still hooked and at this point I am thinking we may never get typical book style character resolution. After all in real life there are no nice tidy resolutions and these characters and this world is more like looking down on what is happening in another world than reading a story
B002RKSZKI|3.0|I listened to this as an audio book which is a somewhat different experience than reading it.  I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles.  I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal.  It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place.  However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.      As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable.  She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position.  This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt!  She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others.  When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person.  Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.    There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I've seen band of brothers and alot of other movies and tv shows, but i can honestly say The Pacific is a clear favorite. It may have to do with one of my favorite actors in the lead James Badge Dale. But I have never cared so much for a group of people as i did for Bob, Snafu and Eugene. Take my word for it, this is a mini series you dont want to miss
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why pay for the blu-ray set when it doesn't even include the original theatrical releases?  It's amazing that George Lucas and Fox studios won't include the original releases of the movies that are worth money.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|This is a great product, I'll just give my pros and cons.  Pros  + high quality build  + nice and heavy  + display is useful and fun  + lots of buttons  + the joystick is useful  Cons  - It is a little bit of a stretch for my hand, but my hands are a little smaller than average  - As others have said, that hat switch requires a lot of pressure, I have it mapped to a rarely needed key stroke  - I wish I could change the key and display colors seprately    This unit is well worth the price, I enjoy using it !

B000W7JWUA|3.0|This is a wonderful game for 3 or more players, but it is absolutely NO FUN FOR 2 PLAYERS! When only 2 people play, one person always creams the other, and the losing player never gets a chance. We have owned this game about 6 months and keep trying to play with 2 people. We even downloaded special adaptation rules from the Internet, but no matter what we did, one player got way ahead immediately in the beginning of the game, and the other player had no chance of ever catching up. However, if you have 3 or more players, it is a lot of fun!

B001FB4W0C|5.0|The DVD came in great condition and was packed well. I love this show so like having it on DVD to play when I want.
B004VSTP4Y|3.0|Love the series but Maggie: totally disappointed with the ending! It read like you rounded everything up very quickly and said see ya! I would've like to read more into their future instead of a few lines about **SPOILERS** her turning 18 and moving out (etc etc). It just felt rushed. Also Isabelle and Cole? Come on! It just seemed so half @ssed. Ugh, wish the characters got a stronger ending to such an amazing series.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I appreciated the American version of Lindqvist's novel. I saw the original Swedish version and it was compelling. I noticed some differences, especially in the final scenes. Aside from the CGI effects, which were fine, director Matt Reeves seemed to find two ace young actors that had a chemistry that was unsettling. Pre-pubescent love? Kodi-Smit McPhee is a fine young actor, with insight and passion for his character, delivering a most natural angst and desire for a friend. He is bullied, mercilessly, as many are, at school. His family has fallen apart, and you never see his father or his mother's face. He is isolated. In comes Abby, played by the very brilliant Chlo&eacute; Grace Moretz. Suspicion ensues, trust sorta happens, and they end up friends. There's a lot more than that, but I can't blab too much. You may already know this, but it's well put together by Mr. Reeves, and I admire this re-imagining of a fine film. McPhee and Moretz are magic together. The original Swedish \\"Dragon Tattoo\\"  films were fine. And I plan to see Fincher's re-imagining of those, too.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee doesn't disappoint in giving her insights on her kidnapping and captivity from the day she was taken until her rescue. Throughout the book she she recounts the events as they happened, sharing her thoughts at the time, and  then her current view as a 31-year-old survivor of how she views those events now.<br /><br />Yet, the book is written very much in the voice of a young child.  Ms. Dugard was taken at 11 years old finishing up the 5th grade. In some ways her writing style seems stuck there, which makes the story she tells more disturbing and sad.  A journal that she kept for one of her pet cats is included in the pages of the book - her attempt at some normalcy in the midst of her psychological and physical abuse.<br /><br />She does not refer a lot to the two children she bore as a teenager (at age 11 and 17).  In the book they are referred to as A and G although she does give an update about how they are doing in school and how much she worries about them as they try to re-enter the outside world and attend regular school. I get the impression that Jayce wrote more about her pets as opposed to her daughters because she is trying to protect their privacy and give them the best shot at having a normal life.  They probably have their own issues to deal with after learning that the father was a pedophile rapist and that their mother was one of his victims.<br /><br />There are a lot of details about the exual abuse she endured;  it started almost immediately with inappropriate touching and nudity and escalating to rape after a few days of captivity when Phil Garrido had Jaycee completely under his control and dependent on him for food, companionship and even a bucket to use for the bathroom.  That part was very similar to Elizabeth Smart's captivity. But the more interesting part to me was how Jaycee dealt with those events in her mind and her own subtle ways of rebelling while still surviving her conditions.<br /><br />I have a lot of hope for Jaycee Dugard. She's clearly a very intelligent woman. Without any formal instruction she learned to use the computer and even operated a successful printing business for her captors. Also, because of her own efforts to homeschool by usint resources from the internet, her daughters were already academically ready for school. As her book went to publication, Jaycee has already obtained her driver's license as well - a big boost for her feelings of independence!<br /><br />Overall I think this is an important book. It certainly speaks out to the dangers of pornography in our society.  Phil Garrido's obsessesion with sexual fantasy and acting it out came from his avid use of ponographical materials. When watching it was no longer enough, Jaycee became his victim. I'm sure this book will also provide valuable insights for profilers, counselors and law enforcement officials in years to come. As a parent, it makes me question a lot of the things I have told them or need to tell them about sex and sexuality and how to balance what they might need to know with preserving their childhood innocence.  I don't know if as parents we can ever strike a good balance there.<br /><br />But most of all, this is a book about survival. And I truly admire Jaycee Dugard for doing just that while keeping her ability to love, hope and dream intact.  I truly wish a bright and happy future for her and her family.<br /><br />Overall I think this is an important book. It certainly speaks out to the dangers of pornography in our society.

0316056863|3.0|Here's the thing about autobiographies from the world of show-business.  There are usually at least three parts.  The first is about their childhood, the second about the tough years as they crawl their way to the top, and the final part mostly deals with their life as a celebrity.  Tina Fey is an incredibly smart, talented, funny woman but  \\"unfortunately\\" her childhood was fairly ordinary and this part of the book was the weakest.  If you want a good comparison you can read, or even better, listen to Kathy Griffin's book:  that woman had some real problems growing up.<br /><br />  The second part of the book - crawling to the top - is better.  Tina did work hard to become a success and clearly had to overcome some serious obstacles not the least of which was the common held assumption that women could never be as funny as men.  There are certainly a few laughs here, but I sense that her ability to write and deliver sketch and situation comedy material is where her true talents lie.  As someone who uses quite a bit of humor in lectures I know that for many delivery and timing is at least half of what makes them funny.  Because of this,  you might be better served purchasing the audio version of this book and have Tina reading her story aloud (I decided after reading so much about her life, that we are now on a first name basis).<br /><br />  The best part of the book is when she arrives at Saturday Night Live.  I, for one, have always been fascinated by the writing process and by the incredible challenge of putting on a live show every week.  Tina Fey learned some valuable lessons from her mentor Lorne Michaels and also from her great success producing and staring in 30 Rock.  This part of a the book is pure gold.  If the entire book were at this level I certainly would have given it five stars.<br /><br />  This is a good book, but not a great one.  I enjoyed it but based on Tina Fey's work and the enthusiastic reviews here and elsewhere I was expecting more.  I would give it a 7 out of 10.<br /><br />[[ASIN:034551856X Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin]]t of 10.

B000I186FW|1.0|This movie bored the socks off me, I was watching it in the background as I was talking on the phone and noticed how over the top it was. All the theatrics, the masks, oy vey!  I could care less about the story and natalie Portman looked like Britney Spears when she shaved her head.  Not a good visual! This film was trying to be important and relevent but it came across as eurotrash.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|It seems like Beyonce keeps topping herself, but she really did it this time. This is her absolute best album. Out of all the forgettable and trashy pop artists who have songs that go to number one on Billboard just because \\"it's catchy\\" and \\"you can dance to it\\", even when it's all an autotuned mess, Beyonce goes above all of that on this album. It's way different than anything she's ever done. She's doing more ballads, inspired from different decades, and it all has a fresh sound. As soon as she announced the release of 4, I knew I had to get it the day it came out, and now I know it was worth it.       The album starts with the soft ballad \\"1+1\\". The lyrics are wonderful and I love all the instruments. It's a great start to this brilliant album. \\"I Care\\" is the second song and it's one of my favorites. It has ballad-ish verses with a powerful chorus. It's amazing! \\"I Miss You\\" is a great and soft melodramatic ballad. The melody is very depressing and while this song is just 1 second short of three minutes, it's still a very excellent song. \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" has to be my second favorite. I'm so glad she released it as a single, because it's so worth it. This Babyface and S1 produced track has a powerful beat and chorus. I didn't know B would come back that strong after \\"Run the World (Girls)\\" (which is still a great track in my opinion).       \\"Party\\" featuring Andre 3000, isn't a techno-ish party song, like it thought it could possibly be (thank God it wasn't). I love the laid-back yet bouncing beat, along with great verses, chorus, and intro/outro sung by Kanye West, \\"You a bad girl and your friends bad too. You got the swag sauce, you drippin' Swaggu\\" I love it! After two mildly loud tracks, the album tames down with \\"Rather Die Young\\", fitting more of the \\"1+1\\" mood, with very romantic lyrics and brilliant production. \\"Start Over\\" is another one of my favorites. The lyrics, beat, and chorus are all wonderful. \\"Love on Top\\" is a great 70s/80s throwback song, and it shows Beyonce's diversity with all the songs on this album.       \\"Countdown\\" is one of my favorites, too. The horns and \\"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\\" countdown are all undeniably catchy, and I think it could possibly be a single. \\"End of Time\\" has amazing African sounding drums and horns. It's my kinda song, cause I love when songs sound tribal, and this really did it. Out of the 72 songs picked for this album, I'm glad she put this one on here. My favorite is the second to last, \\"I Was Here\\", a powerful Diane Warren ballad about how she wants to \\"leave her footprints on the sands of time\\". The chorus is absolutely amazing. It's the best track on the album, in my opinion. Of course the album ends with the lead single \\"Run the World (Girls)\\". Even though it rips off the entire best of \\"Pon de Floor\\" by Major Lazer, I still think it's irresistable. It kind  of feels like a bonus track to this album, and it really does do great as the closing to this album.       The second disc on the Target deluxe begins with \\"Lay Up Under Me\\", a jazzy and romantic throwback love song. It's a four-minute jam that's fun to listen to. \\"Schoolin' Life\\" sort of sounds like a cool throwback song with great lyrics, but I think \\"Dance on Me\\" is my favorite out of the three. It's a sexy 6 minute song with intimate lyrics and a wonderful chorus. After that, there's three forgettable remixes of \\"Run the World (Girls)\\", the Kaskade Club Remix, the Red Top Club Remix, and the Jochen Simms Club Remix. It also comes with a cardboard slip that comes with a sample of her fragrance \\"Heat\\". You peel a piece of waxy paper back and you get the scent of the frangrance, and it smells pretty good, especially against the ink of the booklet paper. The booklet to this album also kind of looks like a magazine, with a picture on every song credit. For each song, it shows the regular \\"Written by, Produced by\\", and then it says \\"Photography by\\", and to the side is a photo. I think the booklet was well put together.       Altogether, this is a \\"4\\" star album, and it's definitely B at her best, using real instruments in her songs instead of cheap synthesizers, breaking the pop mold today. That's why I love Beyonce. Can't wait for the next album B!    My top 3 favorites:    1. I Was Here  2. Best Thing I Never Had  3. I Care
B0000C6K09|2.0|If you want to just hear the songs, it's passable. BUT even an \\"undiscerning ear\\" can hear this is NOT the London Philharmoic, and not John Williams conducting.

0553801473|3.0|After waiting 5 years for this book, I really expected better. It's 1000 pages long but spends much of its page count adrift on a sea of stories that could have been scrapped in favor delivering the book earlier (and shorter). The Meereen story is one I would have preferred to see resolved in 50 pages. So too the Stannis story.<br /><br />Instead, we got hundreds of pages of Mereen and Stannis, and only a few brief drives on the key stories: Bran, Arya, and Dany + dragons. Painful. What's worse, the Jon Snow story foundered, making us wait painfully through more hundreds of pages that could easily have been summarized in much less, without sacrificing any story integrity.<br /><br />All in all, I am disheartened. This book feels rushed (kinda weird, five years later) and I fear GRRM has lost the handle on the story.<br /><br />Here's hoping The Winds of Winter turns out better -- and quicker.
B003102JDM|1.0|I am a fan of Coen Brothers, I enjoyed all other movies they made.  This was a serious misfire for me and made me upset because it wasted my two hours, and there was nothing to show for it.<br /><br />The short story in the beginning did not fit anywhere in the rest of the movie.  The whole movie was incoherent and very boring.  This movie would probably appeal more to people who understand the Jewish culture, and then perhaps get inside jokes and Jewish culture related references and verbiage.  For me it was cryptic with not a single funny moment in it.<br /><br />Just one example: the dentist discovers some letters engraved in the back of each one of his patients teeth.  Well, even this story goes nowhere, and has no meaning whatsoever.  OK then, why is it there?<br /><br />Another problem is that the movie is trying to connect any two completely unrelated events by the idea of \\"actions have consequences\\", and based on that support superstitious belief systems.  Well, *some* events are completely random and do not depend on your or my actions.  When Larry Gopnik changed the letter grade, he immediately gets a call that he has (presumably) a cancer.<br /><br />Gimme a break, that is why I am rating this movie one star.
0525425578|2.0|Because Grisham is Grisham, he can get away with most anything writing-wise.    Theo is portrayed reasonably well, as are a few other lesser characters. Problem is that the \\"kid lawyer\\" locates the missing girl via dumb luck more than anything else, and the youthful sleuths--as well as the police--overlook a likely suspect, April's mother. I was hoping for a plot twist involving this poor excuse for a mother, but no.     Like I said, bland and implausible. Try Gail Giles for much stronger mysteries for young readers.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not doing any spoilers (trying).<br /><br />Finished it last night and my immediate response is much the same as when I was about 60% through it. Had some very good things in it, for example:<br />- GRRM still knows when to stab you with stuff you weren't expecting<br /> - Tyrion & Arya character development keeps you rivited and is something fresh<br /> - Redemption can be possible for anyone<br /><br />Now, what I was dissappointed in:<br />- jfc this is a long book, WAY too drawn out in some areas<br /> - (tied to above) at several times I found myself wondering 'why is this long description important? He could have just mentioned it and I would grasp it!'<br /> - (tied with his decision to split publication with AFFC) ackward structure, see below<br /><br />Thoughts: GRRM describes writing AFFC as 'a bitch' and finishing this one as 'a bastard and three bitches'. In truth I think thats his own damn fault - the brief, tight style of writing he used to describe plot development in the first books is long gone in the last two. What I thought of during this read was if he hadn't gotten so verbose he might of been able to trim AFFC (remember how brutal the first half of that book is?) and ADWD's first half and combine them for a damn good book on par with the first three in the series. I can only imagine the HBO producers are going to look at the last two books and trim them WAY down to make a single season, excepting the last half of ADWD which is different in content.<br /><br />I will say this, I found the overlap of storyline between AFFC and ADWD ackward. It took away from the pleasure of reading this book.<br /><br />To give GRRM credit, the plot IS developing, and not predictably. He certainly has the finest storyline of any author out there currently, and his writing style continues it's gritty narrative that isn't afraid to go into the nasty side of human nature (as well as each character having a very definative personality). I just wish he would get back to giving the reader credit and not feel it necessary to cover plot development so damn deeply it wears the reader out, it might be the same issue of going so deeply is leading to wearing the author out too - hence the long delays in publication.<br /><br />GRRM should learn from Robert Jordan & give the readers some credit, tighten some of this stuff up, finish the damn series before too long.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I am so glad I did not write a review for this movie until now.  In all honesty I did not like the Deathly Hallows part 1 as well as I did the rest of the series.  But over time it grew on me, and I can watch it.  But it would not have earned a 4 star rating if not for the fact that I just saw Deathly Hallows part 2.   Anything I would have stated negatively about part 1 was erased immediately.  The producers of the film had no choice but to split the story in two parts.  At first I thought it was for the money, but that is not the case.   Sure there is about 30 minutes of this movie, I thought was a waste of film stock, so it could have been made a little shorter and still had the same impact.  However, overall for fans of the books (which I have never read); this was the only way for the movie to go.    Now for the part I really wanted to write about.  If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 2, go see it!!!!  It is (in my opinion) the best movie of the entire series!  I knew quite a bit about it from reading snippets of the books from various sites, but never realized how great the story actually was.  What surprises me even more is that I was not at first a fan of the series.  The first film I found a little too childish. The second one was better, but then again it was still a bit childish for my taste. However, as the series progressed, I will say this is a must own series for anyone.  In fact (like Star Trek, and soon like Star Wars) I plan to own these movies on both DVD and Blu Ray so that the films can be watched in different rooms that might not be equipped with a Blu Ray player.      I will not go into this review any further due to the amount of secrets this film and it's sequel reveal.  After seeing the latest one, and this one back to back, I think I will have to go back and rewatch the entire series in order again.  This movie and the newest one is the perfect ending for an excellent story.    Enough said.  Just buy it, it is worth it.

B004WPT3ZM|1.0|There was no true remastering done whatsoever. All they did was jack up the volume almost as loud as Death Magnetic. I was really hoping this record would get a spectacular remastering like Killing is My Business (Nothing added, nothing taken away, only ENHANCING the sound), but it looks like that will never happen. The 2004 remix may have a different sound, but, nostalgia aside, you can't deny that it sounds the best. A bit too loud, yes, but it sounds much more \\"full\\" and balanced.

I'm amazed by Mr. McDougall's exploration of how we as humans are designed to run, more so than ANY other creature ever created. I highly recommend this book as it positively impacted my life and running style. Born to run has the potential to change your life for the better!

B003U21TBO|3.0|Amy and the Doctor visit an art museum in France. They look at the Vincent Van Gogh artwork and the Doctor notices an alien in his paintings. The Doctor gets excited so Amy and the Doctor travels back in time to meet Van Gogh and to meet the Alien. Amy and the Doctor are mesmerized by Van Gogh. Even though he is a troubled man, Amy and the Doctor are pleased to meet him. They found the alien and Van Gogh kills it out of fear. Van Gogh feels miserable about himself and his art work so the Doctor takes him to his future to prove him wrong about his art. Amy and the Doctor wanted to prevent his suicide. It didn't work.    I found this episode disapointing. I liked the first half of it when they meet Van Gogh and the alien. It was mysterious and cute to see them playing with history. But, I felt disapointed in the other half when Van Gogh goes to the future to see his art work recognized as masterpieces. It was unrealistic and a bit phony because the screenwriters didn't convince me that this can be true.

B003TA69A8|5.0|The Doctor goes down beneath the earth to understand the Lizard people better. He understands that these people want to live back on the surface of the earth. The Doctor tries to show good faith by releasing their comrade from his possession but he finds out that she's dead. This causes a lot problems. The Lizard people decide not to live on the surface until humans are more friendly towards them. But not every lizard was so happy. Because of the death of their comrade, Rory dies. Then that strange crack on the wall appears again from episode one. The crack shines strange lights on Rory earasing his existance thus earasing Amy memories of Rory as well. This is part two of a two part episode.<br /><br />Part two is better than part one. I like the death scene of Rory being killed by a ray gun and seeing Amy trying deperatley to remember Rory before the crack takes Rory existance away. What I didn't like was the crack itself. It's a recurring theme for some past episodes. It seems so silly to have it pop out of nowhere without telling the audience why its there.
B00000B9BD|5.0|Every band should get this lucky. If your 70's rock - prog rock collection is sounding a little stale, may I recommend this classic from the Strawbs. It was made in a very short time by the inspired leader, David Cousins , who was trying something a little different for inspiration: the I Ching, an ancient chinese text of philosophy. The songs are very thought provoking and so well crafted, it's not fair (I'm a musician by the way!) It just shows you you never know where inspiration will come from. There is not a bad song on this album. It is somewhat conceptual in that each song kind of goes into the next. It sort of follows the life of a man from youth to adulthood to old age and has thought provoking things to say about life and how it should be lived. Musically it's very theatrical. Lots of flourishes and even dynamics here and there.     David Cousins and Tony Hooper and John Ford provide the vocals. They mix it up and you never get tired of one voice. Also the harmonies are very good in songs like \\"The flower and the young man\\" and \\"Benedictus\\". There is even some cool sitar work on \\"Is it today lord?\\" in the style of George Harrison and \\"Concert for Bangladesh\\". Also the keyboards of legendary Blue Weaver are inspiring in themselves.    The only annoying thing about this CD is because the original album was about 40 min in length, the CD producers thought it would be nice to include 2 more tracks at the end of the CD. I guess this is nice, but it detracts from the conceptual bent of the album. These songs have nothing to do at all with \\"Grave new world\\".
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This is one of my favorite go-to CDs. There isn't a bad track on the entire album. This band has such a unique sound and Florence's voice is so amazing. In addition to the group's most popular song, \\"Dog Days are Over,\\" my favorite tracks include \\"Between Two Lungs,\\" \\"Kiss With a Fist,\\" and a great cover version of \\"You've Got the Love.\\" I can't wait for the next album from this talented bunch!

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have to give this film five stars even though I wasn't completely satisfied with it. To be fair when critiquing this film, you need to judge the film on its own merits and not just compare it to the book it was based on. Even though the film adaptation of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part Two\\" took many, many, MANY liberties with J.K. Rowling's book, the end result is still a spectacular and entertaining film that really delivers everything audiences have been expecting. It's filled with action, drama, suspense, and an amazing ending to a story that's captured moviegoers' hearts for the past decade.<br /><br />And then there are the fans of the books. Like me. And although I recognize that \\"Deathly Hallows, Part Two\\" succeeds as an entertaining movie, there are some things about it that really bugged me.<br /><br />I understand that things always need to be cut for the film versions of books, and I also realize that filmmakers often change things just to make them a bit more entertaining when they transfer to the big screen. Some of those things I take no issue with (spoilers are ahead, so consider yourselves warned). For example, little things that were changed for the movie (altering Ron and Hermione's big kiss, adding a little Neville and Luna romance, etc.) did not bother me. Other changes actually were for the better (showing the scenes where Ron and Hermione seek out the basilisk's fang and where Neville kills Voldemort's snake), because the audience got to see these moments that were never described in detail in the book.<br /><br />However, certain things about the movie were changed for absolutely no reason and added no value to the film whatsoever. The thing that annoyed me the most was the way Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix. When Bellatrix died, she sort of shattered like a piece of glass. What was that all about?! And the end sequences with Harry and Voldemort were so different from the way they played out in the novel: still entertaining for the movie version, but different for no apparent reason. I also thought the Fred Weasley death scene was glossed over way too quickly. The way the scene was shown, you didn't even get a good look at Fred's body. Unless people read they book, they may not realize who it was that died. It just did not do them moment justice. I thought that was the problem with a lot of the changes in the movie...and there are many more that I haven't mentioned here. The film tried to make many of these moments \\"bigger\\" for the movie audiences...more action-packed. But the result was that the scenes lost some of the emotion attached to them, weakening things that were so powerful in the book and making certain aspects of the movie a bit anticlimactic, in my opinion. It was unnecessary and disappointing.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the movie included the whole Snape pensieve flashback sequence, which was definitely a bit different from the book but was so incredibly well-done that it didn't matter. The epilogue was also fantastic. I was a little worried about how successfully the film's makeup artists would be able to age these young actors to make them look like they were in their 40's, but they did a fantastic job and the final scenes of the movie are absolutely brilliant. (I will say, however, that I wish the film included info about what Harry, Ron, and Hermione were doing in for their professional adult careers. That was something that was entirely omitted from the movie.) I also really loved the way the film included flashbacks from the movie \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\\" It was great to see those scenes of the three main characters when they were so young, and then see the amazing young people they've grown up to be.<br /><br />So, all in all, when viewing the movie just as a movie itself, I give it five stars. It's a very well-done and entertaining film. However, Harry Potter purists like myself may be a bit disappointed that so much of the material from the bookwas tampered with.

0307716511|5.0|Thought this book was great. What a good story. I could not put it down. I was stunned by the ending! While it is not an \\"action\\" mystery, I found it riveting. Recently read another equally suspenseful book, The Lock Artist by Steve Hamilton. Both not the usual mystery format but very compelling. I would recommend these to anyone unless you only like action, action, action. Hope to find more from this author.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|Somewhere in New York City in an alternate 1985, superheroes have been outlawed and Richard Nixon is still president. A former super soldier named Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered one night, Comedian's pals from a team called CrimeBusters with heroes like Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a Superman-esque immortal god of powers, blank masked avenger Roschach (Jackie Earl Haley), sexy buttkicker Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and intelligent Batman-esque Nightowl (Patrick Wilson) are together trying to untangle the mystery of who killed Comedian. They are also trying to find out who is behind an uncanny government conspiracy that could cause World War III for they must find the culprit who is behind this.<br /><br />A brilliant and faithful adaptation of the beloved DC Comics graphic novel from Alan Moore and David Gibbons. After many years since 1987 in development hell through many studios like FOX, Universal, Warner, New Line, Paramount to even MGM trying to make the unfilmable graphic novel into a motion picture as many directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Arfofsky tried, then after the success of the motion picture adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 Zack Snyder was chosen as director since he's a comic fan. He used the graphic novel as storyboards for the film as the film was a shot-to-shot frame-by-frame nearly adaptation that captures Alan Moore's masterpiece well on the big screen. It also uses the comic's brilliant satire on superheros and political issues that brings the audience to an alternate universe not seen since The Matrix. It's a thrilling, complex, intelligent and ultraviolent film that sure isn't like any superhero film you seen and it's definitely not for children, this is a comic movie for adults. This is R-rated stuff here like the graphic novel with language, a couple of sex scenes with some nudity, gory violence and of course complexity, Greg Cannom's make-up effects are terrific including the motion capture technology for Dr. Manhattan.

B004BLJQOK|1.0|this movie is so bad its slow paced and choppy. half the story makes no sense what so ever. i did read the book first though so that's where most of my disappointment comes from, the book was acctually really good it explains every thing and is so much more in depth. so basically read the book junk the movie.
B00003CXXP|5.0|If you grew up without a mother, then this picture breaks your heart and it sticks with you forever. It's the ageless, timeless, evergreen Howard Hughes recluse selection that you wanna watch in your old age or on into eternity. It's oh so perfectly subtle and intellectually sentimental. This was Kubrick's baby. It has his cryptic provocative style written in every frame. Most disillusioned reviewers and critics seem to forget that. Master Spielberg pulled off a cinematic magic trick as midwife lensman translating the late fellow giant's vision. In effect, the special effects melodrama foil combo make it the greatest sci-fi flick of all time.      This awe inspiring film appeals in tone, content and scope to the broken home hearts of motherless children as well as those who find a special humanity, or dare I say wistfulness, in the futility of eternal unrealized dreams or wishes. In the lost and found fable, cast wise Frances O'Connor should have won an Oscar, since her angelic presence is what makes the movie work on a gut level. Those who won't allow art cinema a full range of emotion just want fast action or care free happiness in film when entertainment reality requires a fair balance to make us human as in real life. And in doing that, AI will never be surpassed.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Yeah, this version is completely not worth the money.  It DOES NOT contain the original theatrical releases.  Considering Blu-/ray holds 100 gig.  They.....couldn't fit them in....really...really guys???!  Yeah, don't bother.

B003HE2B6C|5.0|I have loved Hanson ever since I was in the 5th grade and MmBop was the biggest hit. Over the years I have really enjoyed how their style has progressed.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|I must start my review by stating that I love the Harry Potter series,but I,am kind of at a lost when the part 1 is better than the part 2,or when the preceding movie is better than the ending of the series,but this is what is happening here with Deathly Hollows part 2.I must say that this was made so much more apparent as we went to Cinemark Theater in Somerdale N.J.where we had the chance to watch both Part 1 and part 2 back to back in one showing on July 14th.First of all you have so many whys in this film,like why when the writer apparently wanted to vindicate Draco do you let Nevil Longbottom kill Nigani the snake rather than panning up from the legs and let Draco do it to vinicate his evil ways all through the film series.Also Dracos two buddies Crab and Goyle have been there through the whole film series but yet one is missing in this film and no one has said a word as to why hes not there, Dead,left the series,did not want to do it,at least something to tell us where hes at.Then we have professor Snape killed by Voltemolt who tells nigani the snake to finish him,the snake in every other film has eaten its victims but he does not eat Snape,why.  This is the last in this fabulous seres and you would expect tremendous magicical super FX effects but there was more power between Voltemolt and Dumbeldor in the next to last film.The producers had a chance to really show some super fire power like between Snape and McGonagle in the first 20 minutes but its snap ,snap and thats it.The duels between Potter and Voltemolt should have been a drawn out explosion of epic proportions but you see more fire power in the new Smurfs movie, maybe we should have had Gargamal in this instead of Voltemolt doing the fight scenes with Potter.  Then we have the last scene 19 years later where they claim all these characters have children but yet the only one that looks any older is Draco.Where was JK Rowling that she would let this series be filmed like this with so many open ended questions.For all the hype that this movie would be the crowning achievement of the series and the most spectacular special effects I think The Deathly Hollows Part 2 comes up way short and I hope when the dvd is released there certainly is a lot of deleated scenes and an alternate ending because this was a really sad ending to a series that was hyped and hyped and hyped..The only high point in this film is we get to see professor sprout,maybe they should have let professor Sprout milk the mandrake plants for a solution that could bring this film back from being petrified....  Such a sad final tribute to this series I loved so much..Shame on you JK Rowling and Warner brothers Films.
B004NJC0B6|5.0|I hadn't watched this in about 20 years because I no longer owned a VCR and the last time I saw it the audio/video quality was not good to say the least.  Wow! What a difference this DVD is.  As many have stated the video transfer is wonderful.  I can't beleive how crisp and clear this concert is now.  It doesn't look like something filmed recently, but for an over 30 year old show, it looks amazing.  Unlike others, I don't have a hang up with the audio.  I think it sounds fine, but then again I'm comparing it to a VCR copy watched on a 19 inch Sanyo TV in the early 90's.  As far as the concert itself, it's classic.  If you're a fan of the band you have to get this DVD.  Bases on others reviews I chose the no frills regular DVD because I didn't think the extras that were listed were worth the price of the special edition or Blu Ray.      The one thing I will mention about the show is I forgot what a pleasure it is to watch Phil Rudd play the drums in his prime.  I'm not saying he's Buddy Rich or Neil Peart, but the man CAN FLAT OUT PLAY.  He's a machine.  I know Angus and Bon get most of the camera time, and justifiably so, but I love watching Phil pound the skins.  If you've seen this movie on VHS, you NEED to own it on DVD.
0156027321|4.0|Very smart work from Yann Martel. Tells the story of an Indian teenager (Pi) that survives the sinking of a cargo ship (in which his family and half a zoo was travelling), finding himself in a lifeboat with a tiger, a hyenna, a zebra and an orangutan. Most of the book is focused on Pi's description of how he managed to avoid being killed by the tiger and survived.   The story has many other levels. Pi's adventure can be described in other ways (I will spare the details to avoid spoilers). The book has many references to religion and zoology, that allow the whole story to be seen with other lenses. It's a very smart work and I recommend it.

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee said she dreamed of becoming a writer during her years of captivity and she has achieved that dream.  I am more than amazed that a young woman with no more than a 5th-grade education is as knowledgeable as she obviously is.  Few of us could have survived the sexual abuse, being torn from family, much less bearing children in such squalor and at such a young age, to say nothing of the brain-washing and isolation she endured.    The book was an easy read in one sense but a dreadful read in another. And Jaycee's story should be a warning not only to children but to all of us.  Our prisons are over-populated and wicked, unbalanced individuals are released every day when they should not be. I often wonder if the man in the check-out lane standing behind me in the grocery store is the nice fellow he appears to be?  You never know--and there is no way to know.      Thank you, Jaycee, for sharing your story.  You are an inspiration.  My best wishes to you and your family.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Think about Tolkien and Frank Herbert and the books they didn't publish while they were alive.  That continual dribble of drivel put out by their children is rather like most of the last 2 books.  A liberal use of the redacting pen could have turned AFFC and Dance into a pretty tight 500 page novel that would have really BELONGED with the other three.  The rest of the material should have been left for posthumous collections for aficionados.<br /><br />This could have been titled Other Stories from the land of Fire and Ice.  The criticism of the writing itself (too much description of the mundane) is to me somewhat off-base.  That is Martin's style, and if you cut it out, what would be left would be more concise, still wouldn't move the story, and would not even feel like Martin anymore.<br /><br />This book is for the type reader who wishes for even more Dune books, and one wonders if Martin has computers full of stories to be mined into another 20 or so such novels after he is gone.  Herbert, I think, was still alive when God Emperor of Dune came out.  That was the last Dune book I looked forward to reading, and so with this one.  Martin may add to the series, but I won't be looking for them - I've had one too many chapters that could be entirely snipped out (but you don't know it till after reading it).  I think Martin should have showed us a little more respect - he is (or was at least) a much better storyteller.<br /><br />I just can't recommend this book.  Read or re-read any of the 1st 3 -your time would be MUCH better spent.  It will be very interesting to see what HBO does with these last 2 books, if anything.
0240816250|5.0|This book is amazingly thorough.  It covers every aspect of black and white photography and also development techniques, such as dark room and retouching.  It goes from light metering to composition and then to finalizing the product.<br />It is big and heavy and very structured, like a textbook.  The focus is definitely on film photographers though, not so much digital.<br />I think it would be a great book for a course.  Great for advanced users that have the vocabulary to understand it all.  However, there is a lot in there that would benefit beginners as well, such as composition and using light.  Beginners might get overwhelmed with the scope of the book however, and digital users will find much of the book perplexing - I know I did.  I have no dark room experience and don't really desire any.  If I did though, I'd have liked this book twice as much.  I did learn a lot, and it offered more than I wanted.<br />The plates are beautiful and it is well illustrated.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really like the \\"plants vs zombies\\" game on pc. I normally dont like tower defense type games, but really like pvz. I even got my parents hooked on the pc version.<br /><br />I downloaded the droid version of game on my phone. I have only played up to some of the back yard levels, so far works fine on droid X(2.3.3). No saved game data loss(as others have reported) yet, but have not played that many levels. Will report back later if any issues.<br /><br />With smaller screen the shovel can be a little clumsy sometimes, you can accidentally dig up wrong plant. The sun packets seem to dissapear faster than on pc if you dont click them right away. Other than that the game seems to be exactly the same as pc version. My only real complaint is it will drain your battery faster than any other app.<br /><br />I would recommend this game to a friend without hesitation.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|When all is said and done - when the eye candy special effects of Quidditch matches and fantastical creatures has been superseded by advances in technology in Hollywood blockbusters yet to come - it is the little moments that this viewer and his wife will return to.    When a friend one time bemoaned the fact that `Half-Blood Prince' gets bogged down in pointless hormonal teen-angst instead of getting on with the story, I smiled... and shook my head.    No, I said, that IS the story and it's what I love about the Harry Potter series: it never loses track of the characters. It never forgets that, when viewed as a whole, these eight movies are a story of growing up, of the transition from childhood to adulthood. Of love and friendship and death. Because without those little funny and touching moments between the characters - if all you want is for the movies to rush from one plot element to another - then all you're left with is plot... and no story. Remember: plot is what happens TO the characters; story is what happens AS A RESULT of the characters.    That's the real gorgeous beauty of these movies, and it's what will bring viewers back repeatedly to their DVD shelves. As Frodo said to Sam in `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers': \\"What are we fighting for Sam?\\" \\"That's there's still some good in this world,\\" Sam replies, \\"and that it's worth fighting for.\\"    That's why you need those little indulgent moments, because without them it's just razzle-dazzle special effects and set-pieces. Harry and Ginny's first kiss: they're in the Room of Requirement and Ginny tells Harry to close his eyes while she hides Professor Snape's copy of Advanced Potion Making. And before Harry opens his eyes Ginny leans forward, kisses him and whispers, \\"That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.\\" That, my fellow Muggles, is pure movie gold. That's what the characters are fighting for. Love. Yes, the PLOT concerns itself with good triumphing over evil, but that only comes to pass as a result of the STORY which is about friendship. Because that is something worth fighting for.    It's why the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's astonishing trilogy, `His Dark Materials', is an utter failure: `The Golden Compass' movie rushes from one plot element to another: and THEN we go here, and THEN we go there. Never slowing down to allow the characters TO BE characters. What are they fighting for? Well, nothing the viewer could care less about...    Ultimately, all of this success comes about because of the brilliant way in which the author J.K. Rowling has constructed her seven-volume storyline. See, `The Chronicles of Narnia' are good - very good - but in the end don't quite fully succeed, and this is because the author, C.S. Lewis, had never envisioned them as a series: `The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was originally intended by the writer to be a one off. As thoroughly enjoyable as the three Narnia movies are, there is no through-story like Rowling's Harry-Voldermort. Indeed, over the course of the three Narnia movies even some of the Pevensie children themselves become side characters. And although that was entirely the point - part of the plot - in the end it harms the story. It dilutes what the characters are fighting for. It weakens its forcus.    Look at the Harry Potter series: viewed in hindsight it's not just the story of teenage friendships, for it also presents an astounding portrayal of one man coming to be viewed in the end entirely differently by the viewer. Professor Snape. What an astonishing character arc - and yet Rowling had it all there, right from the beginning: Snape using a counter-curse against Professor Quirrell to save Harry during the first movie's Quidditch match. Wait, isn't Snape the bad guy?! We're made to wonder, right from that first movie all the way through to the revelations of the eighth. `Narnia' has nothing on that. It's clear that Rowling has thought her seven-volume story through like a military operation: the first four books may have come out only a year apart, but the author had begun planning them seven years before the first one was ever published.    And the friendships, that's all there too. Look at the Ron-Hermione moments seeded throughout the entire movie series. Harry and Hermione are just good friends, thus all the unself-conscious hugs she gives him. Yet there is a physical tension - a conscious awareness of each other - between her and Ron. At the end of `Chamber of Secrets' Hermione flings her arms around Harry... but, both of them equally awkward and embarrassed, Ron and Hermione only shake hands. In `Prisoner of Askaban' during Hagrid's first lesson with Harry cautiously approaching Buckbeak, Herminone grabs Ron's hand, before quickly letting go, both of them looking around uncomfortably. All, finally, converging in Hermione's emotional outburst at the end of the Yule Ball in `Goblet of Fire' where (like a soul crying out `Look at me!') she says, \\"Next time there's a Ball, pluck up the courage to ask me before somebody else does - and not as a last resort!\\" And in another moment of movie gold, Harry and Hermione comforting each other on the steps in Hogwarts, unable to be with the one they want. \\"How does it feel, Harry, when you see Dean with Ginny?\\" After Hermione sends her bird charms crashing into the wall beside Ron and Ron flees, Harry replies, \\"It feels like this.\\"    It's why `Half-Blood Prince' is one of my favourite instalments: not only is it the calm before the storm of the seventh and eighth movies but it allows the characters' friendships to come to fruition. `Half-Blood Prince' does not become sidetracked, far from it. You need that, because that is the story. It's what I love about it: yes, they're wizards and witches but the film makers never lose sight of the fact that they're also young adults going through the most important transitional period of their lives. These movies aren't about fantastical magical events inconveniently interrupted by mushy teenage moments. Instead they're precisely all about those ordinary, everyday teenage moments, played against the backdrop of incredible events. Those amazing events only occur at all because of who the characters are; it's only natural that the plot should play second to the story of their lives. Because they are what truly matters. Because they, as Sam would put it, \\"Are worth fighting for.\\"    As if that wasn't enough, as if the story of Harry-Ron-Hermione (and, indeed, Snape) isn't in itself reason enough to revisit this whole series, Rowling has also given us an amazing supporting cast of characters. All too often in a series, all the characters outwith the main group rarely hold a reader's/viewer's attention for long. And yet Rowling has created not one single boring character, and what an amazing supporting cast they are: the Dursley, the Weasleys, the Malfoys, Hagrid, Dobby, Sirius, Bellatrix, Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, and on and on. In fact, one of Rowling's most inspired moves, and certainly a wonderful way of keeping things fresh, was to continuously have a new colourful character each year as the Professor of the Dark Arts. Glideroy Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Mad-Eye Moody, Dolores Umbridge. Not to forget the delightful potions master from `Half-Blood Prince', Horace Slughorn, or the Professor of Divination, Trelawney. Then, too, you have the caretaker Argus Filch, the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. Well, you get the idea. Quidditch, the Ministry of Magic, the Dementors. The richness of the world Rowling has created is so rewarding that I can't ever imagine tiring of it.    Watching these characters - and, indeed, the actors - grow up before us is fascinating. I love the fact the first two movies are kids movies; there's no hint, really, of what lies ahead. Until, of course, you get to `Prisoner of Askaban'. Even the naysayer film critics sat up at that one and said, \\"Hey, hold on a minute...\\" From the fifth film onwards these were no longer merely kids' movies. It's what accounts for their immensely broad appeal: children will watch them for the action and special effects, teenagers and adults for the humour and the series' growing depth. Even the opening titles change as the story darkens: from bright gold in the first few movies to chipped and crumbling grey stone.    Viewed as one 1100+ minute über-movie the achievement is nothing short of remarkable.    Thank you, Rowling.    And thank you Warner Bros and the cast and crew for the ten-year visual journey of these marvellous books that you have taken my wife and I on.
0817439390|5.0|If you are new to photography or have been scared to break away from auto mode and unleash your total creative abilities - this book is a must.    I recently purchased a professional Canon DSLR. As a casual user of various digital cameras I always had an interest for photography and how to use my creativity to create great photos. As a casual photographer - point and shoot was the way to go - as an engineer - I wanted to do something simple and not worry about learning aperture and shutter speed calculations - since playing with numbers is my full time job and that's the last thing I want to do as a hobby.    I have always wanted to shoot great shots and learn how to manually take great photos and understand HOW I took those great photos. So I forced myself to buy a canon 1D Mark II and jump right in.     This book in less than one hour has made manual photos a breeze. What I feared all these years was explained in a concise and clear way - it's the type of book that makes you get up and get your camera to see if it really is as easy as it is explained - and it really is. Hats off to the author - well done and well worth the money - what I thought was a complex gadget has turned into a enjoyable tool - I recommend this to anyone still using auto or P settings on your camera - you will unleash some amazing possibilities!
B004WJRDN2|5.0|the mccartney (deluxe edition) is mccartney's first outing from the beatles and also his first home-grown album (\\"mccartney II being the second) released in 1970. it contains 5 instrumentals. 7 of the songs are acoustic based. the rest are excellent melodic rockers. great album for the beginning musical artist. shows what you can do with just a simple recording console, some great melodic hooks, and plenty of guts. the sound quality is superb. the book is excellent. i recommend this package to fans who want to listen to macca's first outing, crystal clear, with 3 previously unreleased songs thrown in for good measure.

B004WJREPO|5.0|the mccartney II (deluxe edition) is macca's second home-grown album (\\"mccartney\\" being the first) released in 1980. 2 songs are instrumentals. this album is for fans who want to hear macca's earliest venture into techno pop combined with great pop melodies. it is a precursor to the fireman albums macca would create later. the sound quality is superb. the accompanying book is packed with great stories and of course, excellent behind the scenes pictures (cool studio pics), many never before seen. i recommend this package to fans who truly want to hear another side of his genius plus enjoy 5 previously unreleased songs.

Could be used stand-alone for sure, but in my opinion I think it is best used in conjunction with another book on Java programming, referencing both in support of one another.  Highly recommended.
0439023513|1.0|I understand I'm extremely late to the game here. This book has been out almost a year, and most avid readers of the series had devoured the series ending in a matter of hours of its release. However, my journey through this series was a bit different. I was introduced to the first book as part of the curriculum of a children's book course I took my senior year of college. The first book had a lot of things in it I enjoyed. I appreciated a strong heroine who wasn't completely ruled by her emotions. This I see as a rarity in a lot of YA novels, especially given the turn of the market to more supernatural stories about werewolves and vampires trying to catch onto whatever twilight had going for it, but I digress. Katniss in the first book was a girl who knew what she wanted and knew how she wanted to achieve it. It was very simple: she takes her sister's place in the games to save her from the slaughter and makes one promise that she'll come back alive. It's an amazing premise. It's one I'm left rooting for her whole heartedly to succeed in. It's one that I'm left completely satisfied in seeing how she eventually achieves it while also fostering new feelings of longing to see how she further rebels after her first act of defiance with the berries. However, this is where it all ends for me.    I couldn't articulate what my feelings were for this book for the first couple days after finishing it. I couldn't put my finger on just what enraged me the most. What was the trigger? What's the one thing that disappoints me? I had to take some time and read through some reviews to see just what it could be that's filling me with this sad feeling of disappointment. I want to thank Suzanne G. who wrote a really lovely review about everything that fell short for her. It touched on a lot of things that I agreed with but not even the culmination of those points were quite what was bothering me, but it did help me work though just what was. The answer was in the title character herself. The mockingjay: Katniss Everdeen.     From the first book I was led to believe she was a very different protagonist than what she really was. Perhaps it was because the very periphery role matters outside of the games held. Katniss was focused on surviving the games and the obstacles that presented. What we see is a strong determined girl who might also be one to finally question the capitol's cruelty and actually do something about it with her act in the berries. But that's not really who Katniss is, or at least that's not who she was ever meant to be as we soon learn from the second and last installment of the series. Katniss didn't hold up those berries because she wanted to overthrow the capitol. She did it because she wanted to save herself without having to sacrifice someone she had grown so close to (Peeta). It's said many times in the series, but Katniss has no idea what effect she has on people, and unfortunately she never learns. Making a better world is never a priority to her, as we see her walk through district 12 and meander through 13 it's quite clear that if she could turn back the hands of time make things how they used to be she'd do it in a second. Never mind the fact that people in most of the districts are starving and living under the capitol's tyranny, that people in her own district suffer in a similar way. All that matters to her is that the things in her very small world are ok. As long as her family is safe, Peeta and Gale and their families then she's content. There's rarely a \\"bigger picture\\" moment for her, and that bugged me. I understand she's just a teenage girl, and it isn't completely unique to most teenagers that they should be so narrow minded, but she's not just any teenager. After she saw the backlash of her actions from the games and how it inspired the districts, why did this not inspire her in the least? I will never get over that.    It's bad enough that that's the character Katniss became post hunger games, but what wesee in book 3 is a regression even further. The Katniss we're left with would probably be an improvement if she was just narrow minded, but instead what we get is deranged. She doesn't really care about anything, and she can't make a single decision no matter how small. I was disappointed in her character evolution by the 2nd book, but by the 3rd I was simply enraged. We're finally in the stage of the rebellion, in the thick of things, and we're left with a protagonist who couldn't be more disinterested. I couldn't help but wonder where the character's patience for her came from because I for one couldn't stand her. The one glimmer of hope of redemption for her was her moment where she shot that fateful arrow. For that one split second of a moment I wanted to root for her again, only for all of that to be erased the very second afterward when she's screaming like a lunatic not understanding the weight of what she had done? And in her hysteria afterward she ponders the fastest way to suicide? No, sorry I simply can't stomach that. How can a character perform an act so noble only to be so loathsome despite it all? It's most certainly not a character I want to follow.    I've accepted that perhaps it's my own fault for not being privy to the character Katniss actually was from the start. I've never been a fan of these wishy washy characters who can't make up their minds about anything. That uncertainty can drive suspense in a plot for me for only so long, and after that it's just frustrating and annoying. That being said I'd had enough of that ridiculous love triangle by the end of the first book and afterward it was just tedium. I'm not on team Peeta and never will be as I found his character to be weak and the epitome of milk toast, but her choice (or lack there of) in the end wasn't really what ruined it for me. I felt like she never came into her own. There's very little control in life, but I'd like to see a heroine who despite all that is hopeful she can finallygain control again if anything at the end. Not a girl who concedes to the tumultuous waves of life. Not the heavy handedness of an author who writes away any situations where she might have had to make a choice, and although I hate to keep driving this nail, writing Gale as a more antagonistic character in this installment and then having the bomb he created have the indirect effect of killing Katniss' sister to me is writing that choice completely out for her. Of course he wasn't going to come back in her life. And despite the fact that Peeta was hijacked, of course he would return and make some incredible \\"off-screen\\" transition back to his old self. But again I digress. Katnisss wasn't the character I thought she was, and the character she actually was wasn't one I was ever interested in standing behind. So maybe it was my mistake for thinking she could evolve into the strong heroine I hoped she would be.
1451629184|5.0|This book is written in Jaycee's own words.  Only she could tell her story as she remembers it and as she lived it.  Her endurance through such horrors is remarkable.  Throughout the book she doesn't feel like she has done anything especially courageous, but says she only tried to survive and asks us \\"what would *you* have done to survive?\\"      The terrors of sexual abuse are described in a way that the reader can barely imagine, and even that is too much to bear.  I had nightmares and bad dreams after reading these parts.  The cruelty is indescribable, yet she voices it now with candor and openness.       Although only 11 years old when abducted, she showed an incredible insight into not always letting her abductor see her fear, sensing that such would bring worse consequences to her.      Your heart breaks as you hear her describe her years of loneliness, of her intense longing to see her mother, her pain at realizing she cannot remember what her mother looks like.  She is fiercely protective of her little daughters, and is now somehow trying to learn that the world isn't all bad and scary, that there are people who are good and who care.      I cried and cried reading this book.... Jaycee Dugard recounts a horror that NO CHILD anywhere should ever have to endure.  It makes you furious that the authorities never knew the actual size of Phillip Garrido's property or ever really checked the back yard.  You will want to hug your own children close and do everything you can to make sure they're safe.
B004SBQAL0|4.0|Good story-line, likeable characters, lots of action.  What more do you need from good sci-fi?  Ends with the possibility of a sequel.
B0041KKYD8|5.0|I must preface this by saying that before this movie's remake was released, I wasn't even aware that there was an original version.  Thus, I'm not going to arduously analyze which one is better, more shocking, influential, et cetera ad nauseam, but am going to treat this as the fantastically brutal film that it is in and of itself.<br /><br />Quite simply, I Spit on Your Grave is one of the best revenge shockers I've seen in quite some time.  Lead actress Sarah Butler is simply phenomenal in her role as the protagonist Jennifer Hills, a young writer who seeks solace in a remote cabin to seek inspiration for her creative writing.  Very early in, she is emotionally, physically, and finally sexually assaulted by a ragtag band of rednecks including a mentally challenged man (Chad Lindberg, perhaps the best performance aside from Butler's) and a local police officer.  Anyone lucky enough to not know the plot of the original classic will be wonderfully surprised, as Hills proceeds to hunt down, torture, and kill her perpetrators by the most hideous and imaginative of ways.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, even lovers of brutal horror and gore films will be challenged here.  The brilliant cinematography yields sickening special effects, and the bloody scenes will remain with you long after you sit down to watch.  The inevitable rape scene, though necessary to fuel the viewer's rage and hate at Hills' attackers, is difficult to sit through for numerous reasons, not the least of which is the deep vulnerability of Hills prior to that horrifying event.  If you can persist past that scene, however, you are in for a treat - not since the recent movie Taken have I been so fired up at the response of the film's victim to obstacles, and not since Hostel have I been so pleased by the results of the torture Hills inflicts on those which have inexplicably drawn her to unending rage and madness.<br /><br />All in all, this film is a delight, but for the most stalwart of fans:  disturbing, sickening, and redeeming, all in its own right.  I Spit on Your Grave indeed!g, all in its own right.  I Spit on Your Grave indeed!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Looking back at the Megadeth discography, this one has always been my favorite. The high amount of technical abilities and ultra fast rhythm section is a very special feature on this release. A fantastic musical performance, full of intense songs carried out with great technical ability. Get this album.<br /><br />P.S. The remastered edition sounds great.
B00005JLEU|5.0|(pardon my spelling)<br />Spirited away is the first Miyazaki film I watched. It was also one of my first looks into the realm of anime. The arts work, music and story line held me enthralled at both the ages of eight and now nineteen. I give it a five star credit for being such a simple but elegant move with a story that flowed. It didn't get bogged down in useless detail and leave me wondering what happened.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to all ages.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|By far, this has got to be the best Yes album in decades. There's no Jon Anderson, but it makes no difference. Benoit David holds his own. Trevor Horn's super slick production value easily makes this the best recorded Yes album I have heard. Highly recommended.
B000002UV9|4.0|Queensrÿche's commercial breakthough is not bad, It's certainly got a lot of really good songs on here like Jet City Woman, Hand on Heart, Anybody Listening?, and The Thin Line. There is also the exceptional, spellbinding Silent Lucidity that really stands out in the bunch. However there are some songs which are not nearly as interesting, such as Best I Can, Resistance, and One and Only, which is my least favorite song on the album. These three songs in my opinion are what hold the album back from gaining any more of the \\"Metal meets Pink Floyd\\" praise that this album in particular has received throughout the years (even though it deserves much of that kind of praise). It's a great effort with some really good songs, but all-in-all, not nearly as exciting or riveting as Operation: Mindcrime, Rage for Order, or even Promised Land.
1439156816|2.0|This should have been called the \\"cheap edition\\" rather than the 10th anniversary edition. The binding is extremely poor; the pages are detaching from the bottom part of the spine after just a couple of days' reading, and I don't usually damage books.<br /><br />As for the book itself, well, King's style tends to the vulgar and brusque. He says some good things, but they are mixed up with a whole lot of rambling and self-aggrandization. I'm happy to have read what many consider a classic text on writing, but I can't say I'm any more of a fan of King now than when I started.

0690043961|5.0|Dr. Seuss who? In our house, the Eric Carle books rule the roost, and this is one of the favorites. I have 3 boys: 2 preschoolers and an infant. We have TONS of books, and a large Eric Carle collection. I particularly like this one as the message is good for my older boys, and my youngest likes the bright colors.<br /><br />The story is not too long, probably about as long as \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" but shorter than \\"The Grouchy Lady Bug\\". I think the \\"Bear\\" books (Polar bear, Brown bear, Baby bear, and Panda bear what do you see/hear, etc.) are the best introductory Eric Carle books, with this being a nice transition to a longer story. Visual cues are present on one side of the pages, which enables my 4 and 5 year olds to \\"read\\" the book to me.<br /><br />In short, the story is of a chameleon who wishes he could have features of other animals, but finds in the end it is just better to be himself. What a powerful, yet simple message to send to kids (and grown ups too!).
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|The beginning grabbed me, but I couldn't even make it halfway through the book due to its vagueness. My friends made me read i becase it was &#34;super good.&#34;   It's not.  The author is horrible at describing thngs. Instead of describing something as &#34;blue as a stormy ocean,&#34; it's just &#34;blue.&#34; Well... there's a million shades of blue!!!  I was entirely confused, and also a litte shocked that this book has such a good rating.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was an inspiring yet heart-breaking story. How this girl came out of this with the positive attitude she has about life is awesome. I truly hope Jaycee is able to live her life in peace and comfort while enjoying the freedom of all she has and spending time with her daughters.
0345529057|5.0|I cannot stop reading these!  I have finished this set and am almost done with #5.  Very riveting, rich, and exciting reading, but not for the faint of heart.  These are HEFTY books.  Characters are as diverse as the lands they come from.  I will feel depressed when I am finished, but I will certainly try other books from George R. R. Martin.

B000OONQ9O|4.0|The \\"Director's Cut\\" is different from the theatrical release in that he (Walter Hill, the director) has gone back and added some comic book effects and narrative to enhance the storyline. A lot of people have cried foul, but I, having seen this movie at the theatre upon its' original release back in the late seventies, and also own the original DVD, have no such qualms. The so-called added \\"comic book\\" effects are minimal and take nothing away from the original theatrical version, in my opinion.  The blu-ray version is clean and crisp, surprisingly so for a film of this age and with a low budget. Looks and sounds great. And the extras are very worthwhile. No complaints here.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great little pocket sharpener. I have never been able to get a razor sharp edge with a wet stone but now thanks to Smiths I can. I can get any of my knives to cut a piece of paper by holding it up. Even got my SOG Jungle Primitive bowie knife to razor cut paper. For those who don't understand what I mean by paper test check out this [...]    If you are on the fence I am here to tell you it is worth every penny and honestly I would have paid more for it! It is worth it!    Only complaint is the size. I'm a big guy with big hands and it is shorter than my index finger, so I have to have a death grip on it when sharpening otherwise I slip and cut myself. If they make a larger one exactly like this one I would buy two in a heartbeat. But being small it is more convenient and easier to carry. So you win some and you loose some. I can deal with it being small as long as it performs like it does now.
0071373586|5.0|A few years ago I went on a \\"Trout bender\\" and read everything I could from Jack, including the armload of books he cowrote with Al Ries. Positioning was the only book I ended up keeping afterward, as it was the only one that I ever consistently deployed. I love it - from the product naming advice (including \\"if it's not working, change it\\" which seems to be a very underused concept) to the cautions about line extension (and when to make it work). It's odd to me how many companies ignore or simply aren't aware of very simple ideas that make successful companies what they are. This book covers a lot of them, and if you use what you read you'll be ahead in the game.<br /><br />With that in mind, the predictions may be best if ignored. A lot of examples of \\"look what they did, and they're going to fail because of it\\" ended up never happening, or not happening the way Al and Jack predicted. Oh well, their brash approach to applying their ideas made them hugely successful and I can overlook a few bad rolls of the dice, as should anyone who reads this. The advice still applies, so use it.<br /><br />Highly recommended and is definitely one of the only marketing books worth a damn, in this or in any era.
B002L2GK0O|5.0|Before I bought this book, I made a few batches of homebrew. I wish I had read the first few capters of this book before attempting my first brews, it would have saved me much heartach. After reading this book the quality of my brew increased dramatically.  The knowledge shared in this book is well worth the price tag, don't hesitate buying it. Happy Brewing!!!
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|I love this program.  Can't wait for Season Two to be available for purchase.  Constantly trying to figure out who A actually is an ongoing source of entertainment.  Good to see Holly Marie Combs and Chad Lowe back on primetime television.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I'll never forget the days surrounding her abduction as well as when she was found.  As South Lake Tahoe residents we mourned with her mother in 1991 and rejoiced in 2009.  Needless to say, this struck very close to home and I knew I had to read her story.  It was difficult to read but I understand on all levels why she wrote it, for herself and others.  My daughter, after watching the interview, commented on how \\"normal\\" she seems.  After all her suffering, her matter of fact attitude and the fact that she understands harboring hate will only injure her further are signs of her intelligent, mature character.  I wish her only the best for a happy, full life.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I feel this movie catches the spirit of the books very well, which I am in the middle of reading the series.  Some may think this is creepy and different from the Judy Garland movie and it is.  Don't expect a cheery musical.  Expect creativity and a great story with new characters.  I was young when I watched this, but I'd hold off showing it to the under 9 crowd.      Don't miss out on the lunch pail tree and talking chicken!  I always wanted this to be real.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I just finished this book and was disappointed that finally after reading through so many pages that the end was so quick and you really wonder if she is cured or not.

B001UV4XWY|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Based on the short story \\"Button, Button\\" by Richard Matheson, Richard Kelly's \\"The Box\\" starts off as an intriguing morality tale with a \\"Twilight Zone\\" flair, but the longer the movie goes on the sillier it becomes.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz and James Marsden play a married couple living in Richmond, Virginia in 1976.  He works for NASA, while she teaches at a local prep school, although both receive disturbing news about the continued viability of their jobs and careers.  One morning, they discover a strange package lying on their doorstep, one that contains a mysterious box whose purpose is not immediately apparent to either of its recipients. Enter Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), an enigmatic stranger with a grotesquely disfigured face, who informs the couple that, if they push the button on the box, they will receive a million dollars in return.  The catch is, though, that when they do that, someone they do not know is going to die.<br /><br />So far, so good, as the movie explores the moral dilemma facing these two obviously decent people who certainly would never think of shooting a stranger in the head for a million dollars, but who just might be willing to push a button with the same result if they didn't have to see the death they'd be inflicting on an innocent party in the process.  It might even be an allegory about how people living in the First World don't much care if someone in the Third World has to suffer or be exploited (or perhaps even die) to support their lifestyle, so long as the First-Worlders don't have to know about it and thus can continue living at ease with their consciences.  Unfortunately, the movie isn't able to leave well enough alone, and soon it's devolved into an incoherent mess involving brainwashing, government conspiracies, extraterrestrials, and out-of-body experiences, all swimming around in a stew of metaphysical mumbo-jumbo.  The problem is that very little of it makes any kind of sense and, though the audience keeps waiting for an explanation, one never comes.<br /><br />The movie also suffers from an unnervingly high quotient of goofiness and cheesiness, both in its look and in its performances.  There are times when you find yourself wanting to laugh, even though you know you're supposed to be taking it all with the utmost seriousness (the actors sure seem to be).  The biggest culprit in this regard is the musical score, which is so overemphatic and melodramatic that it becomes almost a parody of itself - much like the film itself in fact.for an explanation, one never comes.

B004KNM3EY|5.0|I expect fans of Suede will really enjoy this new series of reissues.  Each disc comes with the original album remastered, plus \\"all\\" of the associated b-sides (mostly true, but not completely), some demos, rare tracks, and a dvd with live footage (of varying quality) and an interview with relevant band members discussing the making of the album.    The liner notes include lyrics for album tracks & b-sides, plus Brett Anderson's alternate tracklisting for the album, which he created while listening back to all this old material -- typically his new tracklisting deletes one or two tracks from the original and adds a couple of the b-sides.    Coming Up was Suede's best-selling album, and it launched five top-10 hits.  The interview on the dvd features Brett, Richard, and Neil discussing the making of the album.  It's an interesting interview, since this was Richard's first work with the band, and he's pretty eloquent and forthcoming about what the process was like.    As with the other reissues, there are a few odd choices with the extra material -- the original version of \\"Europe Is Our Playground\\" from the \\"Trash\\" single is used instead of the longer (and, IMHO better) version that appeared on the \\"Sci-Fi Lullabies\\" and \\"Best Of\\" compilations.  And throughout the releases, some of the b-sides have been edited or otherwise adjusted since their original versions for no apparent reason.    So if you collect all 5 reissues, you'll have _most_ of the Suede catalog, but avid collectors may not want to ditch all of their old albums completely.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Got this to watch in backyard with projector and new screen.  Got it for 3 families with little kids, big kids and adults.  Primarily, so I thought, it was for the little kids since one was having a 5th birthday.  Well the little kids quickly disappeared to go play with new toys instead, leaving the teens and myself.  As the movie played on a couple other adults strolled out to watch it.  End result is that the three adults and six teens who watched it all liked it a lot.  I'm sure the little ones will like it too when they watch it inside tonight.  The content of the movie wasn't quite what I was expecting.  I thought it would be more about the little yellow guys but they were really more background and sideshow to the main characters.  I'm sure they will end up in some really good shorts though, they're very fun characters.  Steve Carrels voice is great, lots of fun to listen to.  If you liked UP you will probably like this, the same sort of overall feel to it.
B000002UR7|3.0|Disclaimer: I am a middle aged guy, 50-ish in fact. I had heard of Radiohead for some time, but dismissed them as a college band, & I was long out of college. Moreover, I had the impression that a lot of their stuff was techno-driven, and that's just not my cup of tea. Recently, though, I listened to the Bends, & LOVED it. It has stayed in regular rotation for me, shuttling from the home stereo to the car to work & back.   I explored their other recordings, which only seemed to confirm that their later recordings (or at least some/most? of them) were highly techno-driven, and again, that's just not for me. But I thought their debut effort might be a little more accessible to my tastes. Real musicians playing real instruments, not noodling on computers.   Gotta say, though, that this is primitive compared to The Bends. This sounds like just about any other preening post-grunge band of its era. There is little special, little unique about it. Indeed, there's really nothing to suggest the brilliance that was to be The Bends.   It may just be that for me, Radiohead IS the Bends, & ONLY the Bends. The Bends may have been a point at which they quickly passed on their journey from this OK but largely forgettable, derivative debut effort as they made their way to ethereal electronica.   Perhaps other fans can enlighten me: did the band ever produce another disk that sounded anything like The Bends? I was going to say \\"return to the sound of\\" that disk, but I am sure this obviously talented & creative band never moved backwards in their evolution. I just wonder if on their musical journey, they ever hit another point in their progression that would appeal to an old fart like me, who LOVES the Bends, but hasn't found much else in Radiohead's library that finds the musical sweet spot.

Every spoonful you eat makes you sicker and more ashamed of yourself, but for some reason, you don't stop until the bowl is empty, at which point you just get up, walk away, and hope nobody saw you.

B001MSMUH0|5.0|I bought the book after having enjoyed many of the talks by Sir Robinson available on the net. The book is a written version of many of the concepts that Robinson discusses frequently in his talks and lectures. I appreaciate Sir Robinson's style when giving a presentation and I was happy to find this same style in the book. It was almost as if I was listening to him talking. His way of narrating and building a case gets through the book with the same intensity as in live presentations.<br /><br />That said, the book presents a number of examples of people who managed to find their element. Yet, there is much more than that: I found myself thinking about great teachers I had in school, bad teachers, ranking of subjects (is math \\"better\\" than music?), the evolution of creativity, the role that one specific person has had and is plaing as a mentor for me...<br /><br />At the very end of the book, Sir Robinson introduces two methods for quality control used in the catering business: the fast food approach and the Michelin guide approach - that description is sinply brilliant. If I had come to that point not liking the book (which is absolutely not the case), I would have considered giving the book 5 stars for that page alone!
B000002MNR|4.0|Local Hero/Cal: 5 stars; The Princess Pride: 4.5 star; Last Exit to Brooklyn: 3.5 stars<br /><br />I was browsing at a local record store the other day and saw this in the used CD section for literally pennies, so I just had to pick this up, even though I already have the Local Hero and Cal soundstracks. But I was curious about the other music on here.<br /><br />\\"Screenplaying\\" (18 tracks; 72 min.; 1993 release) is in essence a \\"greatest hits\\" of Mark Knopflers 1980s solo output. You may remember that Dire Straits was still around, and very successfully at that (Brothers In Arms, containing the mega-smash Money For Nothing, was released in 1985), so Mark Knopfler chose to do movie soundtracks as an outlet for other creative juices flowing in him, and not just any movies but mostly 'under the radar' indie movies like Local Hero (1983), Cal (1984) and Last Exit to Brooklyn (1989). The only exception was The Princess Pride (1987), which was a fairly high profile movie. This compilation starts with 5 tracks from Cal, each of them with a distinct Irish flavor, check out opener \\"Irish Boy\\" and closing track \\"The Long Road\\", featuring Knopfler's delicate guitar work, just beautiful. The 3 tracks from Last Exit to Brooklyn are very different from anything else on here: mostly violins, and very sober (I have not seen the movie but if it's along the lines of these tracks, it must be a pretty downbeat movie). Please note that while the music for Last Exit to Brooklyn was written by Knopfler, he did not play in it. The 5 tracks from The Princess Bride on here are the big surprise and discovery for me. The songs are instantly recognizable as Mark Knopfler's, and have a wonderful melody to it. My favorite on here is \\"Once Upon A Time... Storybook Love\\". The compilations closes with 5 tracks from Local Hero. What else is there to say about this extraordinary movie and music? I truly believe that the Local Hero soundtrack is in the Top 5 or Top 3 of soundtracks of all time, yes, it's that good!<br /><br />In all, if you are curious about Mark Knopfler's earliest soundtrack work, this compilation brings a very generous and representative serving of it. I will keep my eye out for The Princess Bride soundtrack CD as I definitely want to pick it up now that I've heard the 5 tracks on here. If you haven't seen Local Hero the movie yet, do yourself a favor and get it from your local library or here on Amazon. It's one of the best \\"little\\" movies of the last 30 years (and it's one of the few movies I actually have on DVD). Last but not least, if you don't have the Local Hero soundtrack yet, drop everything and order it now. You'll thank me later for that as well. Meanwhile, \\"Screenplaying\\" is HIGHY RECOMMENDED!In all, if you are curious about Mark Knopfler's earliest soundtrack work, this compilation brings a very generous and representative serving of it. I will keep my eye out for The Princess Bride soundtrack CD as I definitely want to pick it up now that I've heard the 5 tracks on here.

B001992NUQ|5.0|If you like this movie, you will like it even more on Blu-ray. As will all BD, the pic and audio is superior. I don't get many older movies on BD, but, very glad I made exception for this. If you love this movie as much as I do, this is a must-have for your Blu-Ray collection.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I loved the movie and how cheap it was than getting it a Walmart. If you ever want to buy movie or anything else, buy it at Amazon.com you will love the price so much better than going to Walmart or any other store.
B003CLG80A|3.0|This box set was kind of disappointing for $60. First off I was expecting a nice cardboard box that would house the booklet and CDs, like the nice Rhino handmade releases. Instead it came in a thin paper box with a crease down the spine. The CDs came in this awkward paper booklet that seemed like a waste of paper. Second, the track listing wasn't all that great. I was expecting all the unreleased Raw Power tracks, remastered. Instead you receive this mediocre 8 track CD that includes two songs from the 1997 Iggy Mix of Raw Power, which everyone already owns. I have no idea why they didn't include the classic un-released track, \\"Gimme Some Skin\\".  They should have released both the Iggy and Bowie mixes on the first CD and then maybe the original pre-Bowie mixes with all the unreleased songs from the Raw Power sessions. It's not worth paying an extra $45 for what is basically six un-released songs and a 30 minute documentary, in my opinion. You would be better off buying the Heavy Liquid box set for the same amount of money with about three times the amount of music. This is what they should of re-released or taken note from.
B004L49K20|5.0|\\"Astronaut\\" - fantastic - \\"RCM\\" - confusing - \\"All You Need is Now\\" - fantastic.  Makes me worried about their next release.

B001VNB54A|2.0|I couldn't wait for this series to come out being a huge fan of band of brothers, unfortunately in the end it was rather disappointing.  In band of brother you got to learn about the characters and you started to feel as if you knew them personally but with the pacific you have a random group if guys you doing ever really connect with.  The series was 95% dialog, 1% sex, and 4% battle wich in my opinion made it  rather slow and uninteresting.  All in all it, to me, was a disappointment and nothing I would ever buy.
140053271X|5.0|Been in the market for an e-reader, I have tried to read on a tablet and it really just tires my eyes.  Really when you are looking for an e-reader there are two brands you look at: Amazon and Barnes & Noble.  I have tried both and you really can't go wrong with either reader.    However, the Nook Touch is currently the best e-reader available because of two major features:    1.  Touch screen    2.  Short body    Ok, so the Nook has no keyboard because of the touch screen, which makes this guy even more portable than the Kindle.  Its the size of a small pamplet and weighs slightly more.  You wouldn't think that this makes a difference, but it is almost pocket sized and with the same size screen as the Kindle.      Finally, but most importantly is the touch screen.  The current trend in electronics is toward touch screens and there is a reason why.  With out sounding too vague, it just \\"feels more natural\\".  Want to turn the page? swipe, like you would if you were turning a real page.  No button presses, or having to look away from the page, just gently flick the screen. Its so simple, but really makes a big difference and that really sums up the Nook.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|This film is about a criminal defense lawyer who practices out of his Lincoln Towncar.  The movie embraces many of the lawyer stereotypes and shows Attorney Mickey Haller (played by McConaughey) wheeling and dealing with his clients to make a buck.  For instance, in several scenes, Haller is shown strong-arming his criminal clients into paying by delaying a trial or making up excuses about the costs of expert witnesses.  Much of what was shown would be unethical and violate the rules of professional responsibility applicable to all attorneys.  But, it makes for good drama.    Without giving too much away, one underlying issue is the impact of the \\"attorney-client privilege\\" (a rule that forbids disclosure of confidential information about a client) as it relates to his representation of a present client while learning of information that could exonerate a former client.  Throughout the plot, the audience is given a few twists as Haller investigates the crime and learns what \\"really\\" happened.  In my opinion, most are predictable.  But, it is clever how they put it all together in this film.      One of the most interesting parts, in my view, is how Haller gets around attorney-client privilege and cleverly obtains justice in the end.  When you watch it, notice when the detective asks \\"why did you subpoena me\\" to come to the trial.  The reason is obvious if you think back to the detective's asking about the client who was in San Quentin and the implication that the detective was familiar with that case.      In the end, it is a great legal drama.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|I don't usually take the time to make album reviews but I felt that I really needed to state my thoughts on this album. I've been following this band since about 1999/2000 when \\"Make Yourself\\" came out and have experienced several different levels of Incubus...    Having listened to all their albums and being satisfied with every direction they have swayed into and caught their drift every time with no problem and embracing change. Never have I put on one of their records and immediately had a feeling of confusion and disappointment until \\"If Not Now, When?\\". Now don't think this is a bashing review because it is the complete opposite.     Anyways, after giving it a full listen and feeling the disappointment that I did, I was just going to call it good and steer clear from it and stick with their previous releases only. But then the next day I got this inkling to give it another shot, this time with headphones on and a clear head. And to my surprise I was actually enjoying what I heard! The musicianship is tight, and Brandon's vocals are definitely as strong as ever, just more...centered I guess you could say. If you go into this expecting another \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\", or \\"Make Yourself\\" then I'm sorry you might be terribly disappointed but at this point in time with what they have sounded like on their past few records I don't know how you could think they would just turn the ship around and switch back the gears to old territory.     You see what I failed to do was just that, listen to this with an open mind, instead I shamefully dismissed this album wayyyy too early. What you need to do is listen to this album for what it is. Its an album that in my opinion, needs to be listened to as a whole and not in segments to get the full effect. Listen to the band and how they are performing their instruments. All band members have an important role in this record. Listen to the vocals, how they are executed and most importantly pay attention to the intelligent lyrics that this band is known for. If you have fully embraced who Incubus is and what this record portrays then you will surely understand the direction. They are great at what they do. The fact that they can reinvent their sound on every single record, improve and progress along the way really says something about their passion for music.    So I ask you please if you haven't heard this record and are about to embark on the journey that is \\"If Not Now, When?\\" please go into it with an open mind and let it take you in. And if you have already listened to this record and felt unsatisfied then I advise you to give it another listen, a very close listen. See it from the band's prospective rather than your own. Be open, thats all I can say.    My favorite tracks as of now are:    \\"Thieves\\"  \\"Isadore\\"  \\"Defiance\\"  \\"In The Company Of Wolves\\"  \\"Adolescents\\"          Now, what are you waiting for? Listen!
B004SUDPXW|5.0|The quality of this show - the script, directing, acting, etc.  is unfortunately NOT what I'm used to seeing on TV.  Superior
B00006G8HX|4.0|In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982), Spock was killed by radiation in order to save the crew on the Starship Enterprise! Kirk(William Shatner) left Spock's body on the Planet Genesis in a photon torpedo tube. In Star Trek III: The Search for Spock(1984), Kirk and the crew hijack the decomissioned Starship Enterprise in an attempt to rescue Spock...who may or may not still be alive. This film gave actor Leonard Nimoy a chance to direct the film. Christopher Lloyd(Back to the Future, Suburban Commando) plays Lord Kruge, a hostile Klingon who wants to get this hands on the secret of the Genesis Torpedo. This film is almost as dark in tone as Star Trek II. In a tragic scene, Kirk destroys the USS Enterprise in a desperate attempt to defeat some Klingons! In another tragic scene, the Klingons brutally murder James Kirk's son David! This film is one of the first Star Trek adventures where the Klingons speak their own language. This film recycles matte paintings from The Towering Inferno(1974) and models from Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979). Kirk and Kruge beat eachother up just like in an episode of the Star Trek TV show. Two or three soundstages at Paramount Pictures burned down during the making of the film! William Shatner himself helped to fight the fire with water. The scene where the USS Enterprise is blown up by explosions was filmed upside down to simulate zero gravity and no oxygen. Janice Rand(Grace Lee Whitney) from the Star Trek TV show make a cameo appearance as well as a few Tribbles. A young Miguel Ferrer plays an officer on the USS Excelsior. Some of this film's detractors claim it's corny and some of the stuffier ones claim it's \\"very bad\\"! Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is one of the best of the Star Trek feature films. The story continues in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home(1986).

B003UCPEJ2|5.0|Munch, Reiner, Fiedler. Cliburn, Heifetz, Piatagorsky, Price...    When the Living Stereo series came out, it was an all-out effort, a shoot-the-moon style improvement in sound. Yes, there had been high fidelity mono recordings in the past, and they had been done well, but even today, you won't often find the orchestra more accurately and impressively rendered than what you'll hear on these seminal recordings. Just pop in Also Sprach Zarathustra with Reiner, and you'll be floored. Even more so...listen to the Saint Saenz \\"Organ\\" symphony. It's beyond belief. If you didn't have a single classical disk, this would get you up and running, giving you a lot of the \\"core\\" classics in one place, and with fantastic quality. An easy decision: buy it soon, before it's discontinued.
B0055D3EOG|3.0|First, I agree with jce3 about the movie, well...at least the latter part of the movie, being in the tradition of the 1980's Poltergeist.    Also, I echo about what Mathematically Handicapped says about \\"Darth Mal\\" look alike doing a cameo in the movie.   If they would have spent more time on the latter half of the plot and taking out the \\"Darth Mal\\" look alike, the movie would have been more impressive.      Usually a haunted House or a ghost story movie ends when the family moves out of the house.  But this movie did not end even when the family moves out and into another home which is brighter and  quaint.  This kind of made it interesting enough to watch the remainder of this film.    Also, the ghost/demons did not always appear in lonely, dark and dismal settings, but also in the plain light of day in the suburbs -and still retaining the chilling effect. Not to many movies like that out there that has that, except for paranormal activity(1 and 2).  I hope they do not milk this and come out with a sequel.  Keep it as is.   Oh, th  violin sound effects were classy in the beginning.    It does have the creepy factor for those who live alone or at least isolated with an active imagination or even with a semi-active one.  Also, after watching this movie,  they probably will be sleeping with the lights on and plugging their ears with cotton so they will not allow themselves to hear any (new) noises throughout their home.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I checked out this book from the library. After having enjoyed the Harry Potter series, I was hoping to find another series to enjoy, but no such luck.  On the positive, I was interested enough to keep reading the book. However, it never developed.  I have created a point by point list of my issues with the book:  **** WARNING SPOILERS******  1. The first 150 pages were incredibly boring. I got tired of reading about the emotions Katniss felt about her father. Over and over the same emotions were reviewed. I skipped over several pages.  2. After the \\"drawing\\" of names for the games I realized that this story seemed familiar. It was definitely something I had read in high school back in the 80's (yeah..I'm old). I searched on the internet and read a lot references to the book being a knock-off of Battle Royale. However, I am now certain it was The Lottery that I read in school.  3.  Capitol turns out to be a technologically superior district. When Katniss went to the roof of the building there was a shield that keeps contestants from jumping off the roof. Okay, since no one is allowed to go into the forests, then why is district 12 surrounded by a chain link fence. Why not have a shield. Wouldn't that make sense in a totalitarian country?  4. Okay kids as young as 12 are going to fight to the death. Yet they are dressed-up, paraded around, and go on interviews. They act like they are on American Idol. Seriously, if I knew there was a good chance I was going to be killed...I wouldn't be able to sit through an interview. I'd most like be spending my last moments in the bathroom.  5. Page 94: \\"And like as not, the winner will be one of them.\\" What does that even mean? Also, are words like thirstily and guilty a good choice? Too much use of adverbs, especially weaks ones like these are a no-no.  6. I can't get into Katniss' character. She is confused and devoid of personality.  7. The only character I actually liked was Rue. I was sad when she got killed. (positive point- in that the writing made be feel a real emotion.)  8. Is it me or did the images of the contestants that got killed being project in the sky seem a lot like Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire?  9. The deaths of the contestants were uneventful.  I was expecting more gore. More attention was given to reiterating Katniss' feelings. Very little was given toward the deaths.  10. Toward the end the gamekeepers create werewolf like creatures out of the dead contestants. That sealed it for me. That was the most ridiculous part of the book.   11. So it's interesting that Panem has medicines that can cure an infection overnight, but Peeta still loses his leg. Also, they do things to Katniss after the contest to erase her scars, etc. Okay so why not clone the guys leg?  12. Page 216: \\"A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself.\\" Huh?  13. The ending was abrupt and left me feeling empty.  I desperately tried to like this book, but it was terrible.
0545259088|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy. Maggie has such a unique writing style in all her books. She draws you in from the first page and doesn't let go. The characters are so real it's like you are really friends with them and are there throughout the book. Sometimes I forget that they are supernatural beings and not entirely human. They deal with everyday issues along with their lives as wolves.<br /><br />I have loved Grace and Sam since the beginning in Shiver. That was the start of such an amazing trilogy that I could not get enough of. While they are still teenagers their love has been tested so many times and has just continued to grow stronger. I liked how when they first met and it was all teenage love, boy meet girl. Then it evolved into something so much bigger. Their struggles with friends, family and each being a wolf just brought more to the story. Then add in Isabel and Cole and the story gets even more interesting. I thought Maggie did such a great job with these two characters. I loved their whole love/hate relationship. How they came together to save Sam, Grace and the wolves was truly spectacular. I liked how Isabel and Cole's family science background was brought in without it sounding all scientific. It was really interesting and I'm not into science at all.<br /><br />I was surprised and sad that some of the characters did not make it to the end. The part with Sam and Beck was well written, not going to give away any spoilers though. I was really shocked and was wondering the entire time about the Sheriff. I kept thinking he is just setting them up but happy how that turned out. I also liked how Cole was able to communicate with the wolves while he was human. That was an added bonus. There were just so many moments that I could list that I loved throughout this book and the previous ones. I have read and own all the books Maggie has published, I just can't get enough of her writing. She is truly an amazing author. If you haven't read her books, well you need to, you will not be disappointed. While I am sad to see this story end I'm looking forward to reading Scorpio Races and anything else she writes.<br /><br />This book was given to me as a review copy from the publisher, it did not affect my review in any way.ill not be disappointed.

B000AP04EW|5.0|Price was right so decided to purchase Mr & Mrs Smith as I had started watching it on TV and was constantly interrupted.  Therefore, saw movie in bits and pieces.  It is a silly, fun movie - the fun is in watching Pitt and Jolie working together. the beautiful people, so to speak. :~D
B0055FR5PS|2.0|Stereotypical Hollywood view of soldiers. Stereotypical but effective.  Excessive camera movement. Background noises so loud you can't follow the dialogue. Backstory - almost incomprehensible.<br /><br />Special effects were top notch. Aaron Eckhart's performance although given boilerplate lines straight out of a bad John Wayne movie - was quite good.<br /><br />It certainly had potential.  Blame the director.
B002NSLMYU|4.0|I liked the story, didn't like how the author felt he has to explane everything for the reader.   I wish he would just tell the story and let me make my own conclusions!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Maybe more of a 3.8 or 3.9 than a 4.0. But - in this day and age - McFestus rounds up. Story - credible. Acting - good. Matthew M is not the same as the lead lawyer in the book, but his take is more than passable. Plot - interesting with enough twists and turns to keep one involved. William H Macy and John Leguizamo deliver with authority in their brief parts. Ryan Phillipe handles the spoiled young man part with aplomb. Almost as if he has done it before. It's a good solid effort.
0749942010|2.0|After reading good notices, I ordered this book.  I finished it yesterday and found it a disappointment.  Billed as a thriller, it was anything but.  I thought the prose was turgid and the book was over-written.  By the middle of the story I was tired of the narrator's self-pity.    As to plot, the villain was evident rather early, but the saddest part was the contrived ending.  I felt cheated by such a cheap device, which I won't spoil for others who haven't read the story.      If you like gothic romance, you'll like this book.  If you prefer superlative writing and a tight plot, try \\"The Secret History.\\"
B0051MKNV8|5.0|What I Can Tell You: First, lets start with, I am a huge Bradley Cooper fan. I mean, how can you not be, the body, the eyes, the hair, the quirky sideways smile, love it!<br /><br />The movie starts off with Bradley standing on a roof about to take his life and someone banging at his door. How did  he get there? The movie takes a huge \\"mother may I\\" step backward and we find out. Bradley, or Eddie in this movie is a divorced \\"after two seconds\\" sad sack writer who can't even get people to believe he has a book contract because he is so pathetic.<br /><br />How do you make sexy Bradley Cooper look like he is pathetic? Well, give him crazy, lackluster, long hair and don't let him smile because it will crinkle and brighten his sexy blue eyes. Eddie is a slob who can't pay his rent, or come up with a sentence for his book until he runs into his ex-junkie-brother-in-law. His brother-in-law gives him a designer pill and tells him that all will be clear once he takes it. Like Alice in Wonderland he takes the pill and suddenly, Eddie has the gift of gab!  The drug kicks in as he is being screamed at by his landlords wife/girlfriend (I don't remember, she was unimportant) and suddenly he is in her apartment, helping her write and having sex with her. He can recall things he doesn't even remember, everything he ever read, things that he only saw but didn't even realize it had imprinted on his brain. He learns to play the piano in 3 days. He can speak any language. He suddenly knows everything about everything.<br /><br />He heads back to his brother-in-laws for more drugs. The BIL tells him he knew he would be back and that he needs to get his cleaning and some lunch for him and he will give him the drug. When he gets back his BIL is sitting on the couch after being shot in the head and the apartment is trashed. He calls 911, searches for the drugs and has a lot of explaining to do.<br /><br />The drugs change Eddie's life. He is back with his ex girlfriend, he is successful, has tons of cash and everyone is interested in him. Sounds great but his new fans are good and bad people. Eddie's stalkers want the drug and want him dead.<br /><br />Great movie for fans of dramatic thrillers or Bradley Cooper fans. Oh BTW...the great Robert DeNiro is in here too.is interested in him. Sounds great but his new fans are good and bad people. Eddie's stalkers want the drug and want him dead.    Great movie for fans of dramatic thrillers or Bradley Cooper fans.

B004WKOCP8|3.0|It's no doubt to anyone who (even remotely) knows me that I am a huge Incubus fan. I have been since high school; in love since that first Incubus concert I saw in 2002. If any regret, I wish I had been listening to them sooner on. My obsession and love for Incubus has been the same as it always has since day one. Even after this album's disappointment, I doubt there will be a day where I will up and boldly say, \\"Incubus blows.\\"    I placed my hopes for this album, oddly enough, on a song that isn't even on the track list. Incubus was headline band for Cypress Hill Smokeout 2010 in San Bernardino, California. They performed \\"Surface to Air\\" and I was looking forward to the new album from that point on based on that song. I heard \\"Adolescents\\" a while after that and thought it was alright...maybe more appropriate as some sort of Morning View b-side. I hoped that the remainder of the album would move in the direction of what \\"Surface to Air\\" had in it.    It didn't.    There have been numerous statements from various members of Incubus talking about this new album and from the start everyone knew it was something that was going to be different than anything they have done in the past.    Lead singer Brandon Boyd dedicated a blog to this topic specifically; [...] ...and that's exactly what it is. Someone listening to the new album might think, \\"am I listening to the same band that created S.C.I.E.N.C.E.?\\" I know that thought ran through my mind more than once while listening to If Not Now, When? for the first time. I had to listen to the album while reminding myself that the year is 2011, not 1997.    Mike Einziger, guitarist of Incubus, attended Harvard to study musical composition and impressively infused components of science into his music, notably physics. He premiered his piece \\"End. > vacuum\\" at UCLA only a few years back where he experimented with a variety of sounds and how they would combine. He had a large hand in the direction of the music and the composition of this album. It leaves me wondering what his inspiration was for this album's composition. I'm a little lost and slightly disappointed because they have plenty of songs which demonstrate more complexities than there seemingly were in this album but Einziger would likely disagree with my sentiment. He said recently that he feels this is their most solid and concise work yet and he feels it is the best. To be fair, if you have the time to sit down and listen to any of Einziger's work you'll see it is a different sound than that of Incubus.    As far as Jose Pasillas, Ben Kenney, and Chris Kilmore all seem to be in agreement that this is their best record so far (there are some various interviews easily found on YouTube). My guess is this is the direction we're going to be seeing in the future for this band and I reluctantly have to accept this reality.    Despite my initial disappointment of If Not Now, When?, I knew I would have to go back and give it a fair chance. I had to keep in mind what was said by the band members about this album. I still felt as if there were a lot of songs on here that just lacked that something. I didn't feel like Incubus. It lacked the intricacies of bass lines running obscurely under the main melodies. I found the beats basic. I found the music undynamic and even boring at times.    With everything said by this point, I'm trying my very best to look at If Not Now, When? as its own entity separate from anything prior to this album. To have a fair evaluation, I would have to look at this album as if it were by a band I didn't know. Though if I were trying to convince someone that Incubus is a great band, this is not the album I would use. The Incubus on this album is definitely not one I know well, but it is still undoubtedly Incubus.    Track list  1. If Not Now, When?  2. Promises, Promises  3. Friends And Lovers  4. Thieves  5. Isadore  6. The Original  7. Defiance  8. In The Company Of Wolves  9. Switchblade  10. Adolescents  11.Tomorrow's Food      1. If Not Now, When?  As an opening track, I found it to be boring and almost painful to get through. Though, listening to this track with what Boyd had said in his blog, you can see the visualization of \\"ripples\\" throughout the song pretty easily.      2. Promises, Promises  At this point, I was getting panicked. I wondered if anything was going to pick up. There are a few phrases in Promises, Promises that I listen to and expect them to go somewhere, but they end up falling flat. In fact, the whole song starts out sounding promising, no pun intended, but it builds (or doesn't) to a sort of anti-climatic chorus with layered vocals that sound a little bit cheesy and out of place. I would sum this song as being a piano rock-type that is a bit monotonous and drags.      3. Friends and Lovers  This was the first song that was written for this album...but that's irrelevant. This is a ballad that has unenthusiastic, drawn-out verses leading to a rather mundane chorus. The musical aspects of this song are quite lovely and surprisingly the vocals take away from that beauty (composition, not Brandon's voice in itself). The bridge is somewhat redeeming. The bridge comes together well and provokes a little more feeling and emotion than the other parts of the track. Unfortunately, the bridge also leads you to believe that something amazing is about to unfold but never did.      4. Thieves  The fourth song in we have something with a little more drive that the previous three songs seemed to lack. The moment Brandon's vocals begin you catch a glimpse of the older Incubus. At first listen, the verse is much less impressive than the chorus, but when you reach the chorus familiarities of an old band return but with a very modern sound. After those few listens the verse is fitting and builds nicely into the chorus. Overall it's a nice song.      5. Isadore  This song was a wonderfully redeeming factor of this album. It was a great surprise embedded in the middleof this track list. I was enamored the first time I heard it. Everything about it, to me, is quite beautiful. It's beautiful and it's tragic all at once. Weird, but this song sounds a lot like \\"She Will Be Loved\\" by Maroon 5...      6. The Original  The drum beat reminds me of the 90s or 80s. Maybe it's just me. The song initially catches attention but it doesn't feel like it goes anywhere. It's ok. It feels like it drags more and more as the song progresses.      7. Defiance  This song just has the acoustic guitar and Brandon's wooing vocals; it sounds as if it belongs on an acoustic record. It's not a song to write home about, but it is nice. It has energy but simultaneously edges on being a little boring. It's the shortest track on the record at 2 minutes and 19 seconds.      8. In The Company Of Wolves  When you have the \\"long songs\\" (as I refer to them as) such as Just A Phase, Sick Sad Little World, and Vitamin (live performances) then followed by In The Company Of Wolves, I was a bit let down. The first 3 minutes of the song is kind of boring. I'm not going to lie. Shortly after the 3-minute mark is where the magic starts to happen. The second part of the song, as I refer to it, is a musical and lyrical journey. It has a seductive sort-of groove to it and makes me wish something different preceded it. I have just ended up jumping in 3 minutes just to hear the last 5 minutes or so of the song.      9. Switchblade  This actually starts out like something you just might find stuck in between some tracks on Light Grenades. It starts out like it could be going somewhere from the verse and into the pre-chorus but it digresses into a cheesy series of layered vocals. The verses are the best part of the song. However, the absolutely best part about this song is the guitar line.      10. Adolescents  This is the single. It's all over the radio. It is everywhere. And it is deceptive. Nothing on this album is like this song. This song sounds like it should come from Morning View. It's a decent song, but not amazing.      11. Tomorrow's Food  There are definitely some very pretty aspects of this song. It's a bit undynamic like the opening songs. It's a very pretty song, but I'm still unsure of the vocals. Musically it's a nice way to end the album.      I tried. I tried my best to create a review sans comparisons to earlier albums. I flopped a few times on that, but I feel it was necessary.      Here is what Mike said in an interview: \\"I think we're asking a lot of our fans,\\" he says. \\"We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making his type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album. It's a very straightforward concise album. And it's a lot more focused than anything else we've ever done. So naturally I think this might disappoint some people, because there's a pretty obvious lack of heavy rock music on this album.\\"    ...and he's completely, 100% accurate. Maybe when I get to be the age they are all around now I'll get it. Perhaps there's something I'm missing because I'm not at the same point in my life as the members are. Until then, time will tell.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I found the first season of Haven so fascinating I watched all 13 episodes with few interruptions. Wonderful writing, characters and visual effects. The series does a fabulous job showcasing Lunenburg Nova Scotia (where most of the filming takes place) and that area is now high on my vacation wish list.   If you enjoyed X-Files, Roswell or Fringe, Haven is a must-see.
1586487981|5.0|I had the opportunity to read this book Poor Economics by  Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. The book provides excellent insights into the life of poor. The main objective of the book is resolve the conflict between the two solutions for global poverty. One of the solution being is to do nothing and allow the market to evolve in poor countries and other being to fund them until the markets are mature enough to take care on their own.    The authors try to emphasize the fact that there is no one fixed approach to solving the poverty problem. But through RCT (Randomized Control Trials) which many researchers and authors have conducted, the authors try to show that how simple policy changes to existing programs can make it more effective.    For eg. take the example of child vaccination. The authors inform us that in certain poor areas in rural Rajasthan even when vaccination is free, people tend to avoid the program for a variety of reasons. One being superstitious beliefs against vaccination and other factor is time inconsistency. Time inconsistency affects the rich and poor but in the latter's case the consequences are much more drastic. Here the poor understand that vaccination might be better for their children's future just like we understand that eating healthy foods will prevent heart-attack in the future. We keep postponing our habit of eating healthy foods, the poor who have other immediate problems to take care (like the next meal) keep postponing their decision to take their vaccinate their kids. Now when the vaccination program made a small change of adding an extra provision of providing 2Kg dried lentils with each vaccination, the program saw a significant jump in % of children getting vaccinated. The authors explain that the superstitious beliefs though prevented vaccination, it was not rooted strongly in their minds. And by adding the free lentils to the program the poor could come to the camp, get vaccinated and go back home and need not worry aboutthe next meal at least for that day.    The authors also show that poor, in contrast to the popular view that they are lazy and spend irrationally have a lot of factors going against them. For example the middle class society takes many things are granted. For eg. Vaccination: Once the child is born, the hospital immediately provides vaccination. An other example the authors cite is drinking water, we need not worry on water being treated with chlorine to prevent certain water borne diseases, the government does that for us. But for the poor, the water sources (wells, ponds) in their case needs to chlorine treated, else they are susceptible to infections. The poor need to take decisions constantly for their next meal, medicine, money for their business etc and at each step they face more problems than a typical middle class person.    The authors cover the following topics of health, education, insurance and loans (MFI, banks etc) for the poor. In each case they provide insights on why certain policies work and certain don't and how significant achievements in reducing poverty can be made even within existing political structures. Well researched and an useful book for anyone who wants to understand about global poverty.
B00005JOA0|5.0|This is another wonderful BBC period romance/drama based on the book by Anne Bronte. The well-cast actors do a great job.     Helen, an affluent society woman arrives in a rural farming town in widow's attire with her little boy.  She is reserved and reclusive, so the local folk are very curious about her and a bit disapproving. However, Gilbert, a handsome, charismatic farmer takes a strong interest in her. Although she is cold at first, she warms up to him bit by bit. They become friends, then more then friends in their feelings towards each other; but there is something that hold's Helen back that she is unable to divulge to Gilbert or anyone.        The local folk begin making presumptions about Helen's character and \\"I dare say\\" the gossip abounds and the community including the Vicar, all judge her harshly and begin to snub her. Gilbert defends her while knowing she IS hiding some secret, even from him and tries to get her to talk about her burdens.  It is not clear what happened to her and her boy for half the movie; but there are several flash backs to some dark memories.      The movie is a bit of puzzle that unfolds slowly and comes together at the end, with some twists and surprises.  What happened to Helen in the past?  Will she and Gilbert who clearly come to love each, ever get together? Alternatively, will Gilbert marry the village girl he was keen on up until Helen appeared on the scene?    This movie will not disappoint BBC fans.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I have read all three of the books and they were fabulous I read Shiver while in school and my teacher told me more than once to quit reading in class.With the first book you instontaneously fall in love with the chariters and the plot and storyline.Linger I read while on break from school it sucked me in, it made me laugh and it made me bawl like a baby in some parts.Forever I got preordered to my kindle and the moment I woke up (on July 12th) I grabed my kindle and started reading. The trilling conclusion to this wonderful series you will love it guarented.  All in all: the love story told throughout these booksis a beautiful one showing what one will do for love. P.S.

0553582038|5.0|Many have complained that GRRM has lost his way, citing A Feast for Crows as the primary reason. More specifically, the slow pace of this book is cited, especially after the exciting finale of A Storm of Swords. Yet it is important to remember that Martin's books are not about rapid plot developements but rather complex, contemplative characters and careful political manuevering that builds up to a series of brief but shocking final events. It took 3 books to reach the brilliant climax of A Storm of Swords. And now, with book 4, GRRM is beginning the buildup again, with a focus on newer characters, or else a deeper focus on previously underdevleoped characters. If you enter AFFC expecting another series of plot developements like the end of ASOS, then you will be disappointed. But, if you view this book as another Game of Thrones, a book of slow developement that culminates in one or two crucial events, then you will understand.    This is, ultimately, Jaime and Cersei's book, and it reveals minds of the two Lanniester \\"villains\\" (and I use that term in quotations with good reason) as never before. Brienne, also, has an interesting journey, but this book is really about the changing natures of Jaime and Cersei, once twins and seeming reflections of each other, now being pulled apart by different moral codes and situations. The distance that grows between them is both literal and psychological, and this book is a masterful chronicle of that development.     I have full faith that GRRM will bring the newly created plot threads together in a conclusion that will rival ASOS for its intensity. AFFC was not inteded to be another Book 3. It was another Book 1, a set up to push the characters in specific directions will climactic events looming on the horizon, yet still a ways away. Enjoy the book for what it is - a meditation on the morality and culture of world GRRM created through the eyes of the series' antagonists, with a depth that few fantasy authors care to explore.And rememebr, while this book may feel like a long journey, GRRM will, as all great authors do, deliver to us a wondrous end.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|This movie was superbly directed, which I would expect from Clint Eastwood.  I can honestly say it is now one of my all-time favorite movies.

B000UDCU96|5.0|This superb thriller mixes danger, suspence, and political conspiracy.  Supreme Court justices Abe Rosenberg and Glenn Jensen are both murdered on the same night, victims of the same professional assassin.  The killer left few clues, but following a hunch by her professor (and secret lover), a young law student from Tulane University named Darby Shaw investigates a series of legal papers that might provide clues to the dual murders.  Sure enough, Darby discovers a possible angle, and writes down her discovery in a legal brief.  Her professor/lover then hands her  ¨Pelican Brief¨ to his friend who is legal advisor to the FBI director.  Soon the CIA, FBI, and President (plus his top political sharpshooter) are all manuevering due to Darby's Pelican Brief.  Days later the professor is killed, and Darby (who narrowly escapes) realizes that as author of the Pelican Brief she is now the prime target of unknown but diligent killers.  Darby eludes her pursuers via disguises and moving between hotels and cities, but they remain hot on her trail.  She also teams up with that FBI legal advisor plus a top political reporter in an effort to uncover the mystery while also staying ahead of her would-be assassins.      Attorney/author John Grishman has an gift for flowing prose that puts readers squarely in the place of his main character.  Here we join young Darby Shaw as she tries to outwit and elude unknown, deadly pursuers.  The result, unsurprisingly, is another top-notch legal thriller.  Readers might also enjoy Grisham's others other top efforts, including THE FIRM and THE CLIENT.
0553801473|3.0|The first 800 or so pages of this book are exactly what everyone would expect: Every piece on the board moving towards the interesting plot points. Bran, Daenerys, Tyrion, Victarion, Quentyn, and several others who's mere mention is a spoiler. Jon too is doing lots of interesting things up on the wall, and the North has many great happenings. And, it is all greatly written.<br /><br />But then, all those leads lead nowhere. The big battles are off in the future. The big secrets are still secret, with not even a new lead as to any of them. Even the cliifhangers in the last chapters of the book are not half as thrilling as many in the middle - most are merely frustrating, knowing that we will not hear of them again for years.<br /><br />I imagined great things going into this book - learning about Jon's parents, traveling to new and exciting locations (Asshai or Valyria, mayhaps), and getting down with some Others. But nothing great ever truly happens. This is indeed the second half to A Feast for Crows - a transition book that only hints at the actual transition about to unfold.<br /><br />Personally, I think is is best to wait for the next book instead of buying this one, if you haven't done so already. The most you'll miss is some speculations with your friends, but even those will most likely rely on information from the first four books, with no big nuggets of information in this one.

B000056JYC|5.0|This is one great annivesary release, it brought back alot of memories from the seventies for me. I remember everybody had a copy of this recording on cassete, 8-track or album carrying it around in school. This remastered version sounds so much better than the original, and the track listing makes you feel right at the show as the songs were played in that order instead of picked and placed in an order like the original. I also like the booklet and aditional photos that came with the release. It is easy to see why this album was the best selling live album of all time because it sounds just as good today as it did then, you can't go wrong with this one!

Now after understanding their significance in their life, I started teaching to my colleagues and family members.<br /><br />There are examples I can say here to understand the effect of Jack's writing. ASK! ASK! ASK! is such a wonderful philosophy I would say which transformed me like anything. I never used to ask to anybody thinking that I have everything and I know everything.

B004WN96ME|5.0|In a very short amount of time around 15 months, I have become an enormous Megadeth fan and quickly acquired almost all of their works. I saw this box set for the re-release of Peace Sells and it was pre-ordered soon after the announcement. This box set is the most amazing piece of memorabilia I have, and I hope you can enjoy it as well. Here I'm going to go through each disc first since it comes with 5!!! The LP are not necessary since the LP's are simply LP versions of discs 1 and 4. Disc 1: Being a new fan of megadeth, I own all of the remixed tracks, so to play the original album just blew my mind. They sound completely different and have their strong suits, this one being it's classic vibe and ultimate raw feel. Disc 2: This is the 2004 remixed disc excluding the bonus tracks (this will be explained) and it is also amazing, especially as the counterpart of Disc 1, being much tighter and refined and sounding much more modern. Disc 3: If you are wondering about those missing bonus tracks, this is where they ended up, because Disc 3 is the entire Randy Burns mixed album remastered. This one plays similarly to Disc 1, but gives an even looser feel, and a look at one of the ways the album was designed to end up. Also a great listen, it is really another way to view a fantastic album. Disc 4: This is where I saw people getting angry. This a fantastic 1987 performance, trying to represent that era. I've heard immature complaints about the sound quality, but this is normal because of the time it was in, and the bands less than much popularity, thus fortune to spend on live recording equipment. If you can ignore the \\"sound quality\\" and listen to the \\"musical quality\\" then you are in for another thrashing live performance. Disc 5: Quite simply, this is a hi-res version of discs 1 and 4, running at 4600+ kbps instead of the common 320 kbps, not much to say.  Other: The artwork included in the album is absolutely incredible, along with some amazing band photos, an Intro byMetallica Drummer Lars, and an Intro by Dave Mustaine. The last addition is two Peace Sells era band photos, two Peace Sells era concert flyers, and a Peace Sells concert ticket. It's a beautiful collection of memorabilia and history along with every way possible to view one of the best Metal Albums Of All Time. This is a must have for any Megadeth fan. RATTLE YOUR GOD***N HEAD!!!
0143038419|5.0|Fabulous read! I saw the movie first, which I normally don't do but, in this case, it was helpful. The author is wonderful with words and imagery. Perfect condition and timely arrival!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I guess everyone like the other two better, I really liked this one.  I felt that things came together nice in the end, and that there were fewer crazy surprise events.  I was leery on the first two, I thought they were a little dramatic for me (ok now rabid dogs are attacking, really?) But this one I felt was just dramatic enough to be more my style.  I enjoyed it.
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is another amazing installment of the Fire and Ice series.  I am so impressed with GRRM's ability to write such vivid novels, with so many characters, places, and plots.  This book has tied together a lot plots, explained a lot mysteries and brought some characters into the game of thrones that were previously believed to be dead.  I Enjoy everything about this series, including the fact that I don't want to love any character as they could be dead before I turn the page.
0393338827|3.0|Michael Lewis tries to show how a handful of traders and hedge funds saw what no one else apparently did -- that the U.S. housing market was about to crash and a lot of big companies would suffer terrible losses -- but falls down almost from the start by not being able to explain clearly the kinds of dubious financial products helped cause the calamity. I have now read this book three times over the last two days and still do not fully understand (a) how these products were put together (b) how they were supposed to work and (c) how it was that the people on the wrong end of the zero sum bets ended up losing so much money. Lewis writes in his usual fluent fashion and is good at describing how the handful of people he focuses on developed the analytical skills necessary to work out there was a ton of money out there waiting to be made. I wish he'd spent the same effort explaining to the reader how these CDOs and synthetic CDOs and such-like worked (or didn't work).
0553801473|3.0|This is a hard one to write about.<br /><br />We all wanted it so much. Those of us who read A STORM OF SWORDS in 2000 doubted we'd ever see A FEAST FOR CROWS, and when it finally appeared in 2005 it wasn't nearly the banquet everyone wanted. Now, nearly six years after that, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS arrives. To be honest, it wouldn't be humanly possible for any writer to give Song of Ice and Fire fans all that they crave, or even enough to sate them for what could be, realistically, another five-year wait. Any book will fail that task. As does this one, even while in some ways it succeeds. Partway through a re-read I'm finding more to enjoy, more gems and clues, but ultimately it falls short of what I'd like it to be, or would have expected.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Mr. Martin set his own bar impossibly high eleven years ago. STORM was, and remains, riveting, moving, exhilarating, utterly engrossing. I still believe that the second half of its massive text is one of the best reads anywhere, anytime. The sweep of characters across continents, through court, and within themselves never stops moving. It is a masterpiece of huge players on a stage of immense richness and depth.<br /><br />Then came FEAST. So much smaller, both in size and character. It had to be: the momentum couldn't possibly be maintained. While much-maligned, I feel FEAST is better and more purposeful than its detractors would believe. Its smallness paints a picture of what Westeros has become: the aftermath of STORM's turmoil. It felt like a stepping stone, a prologue to the next chapter. The calm before the next STORM.<br /><br />DANCE is not that storm. It is, however, the companion to FEAST, which is what it was meant to be. After so many years it is difficult to remember that DANCE is the other half of FEAST, the half that couldn't/didn't come out at the time. It's not going to be as immersive as STORM was because it was never intended so. DANCE matches FEAST's smallness by introducing (or re-introducing) smaller characters and smaller gains. There is no way the Ironborn or various Dornish can hold their own against Tywin Lannister, The Hound, Varys, Beric Dondarrion, Lysa Arryn, the Band of Brothers, the Queen of Thorns, Oberyn Martell, The Mountain, or the Others. The book will feel smaller because its people are smaller. It is a flagstone in a path, a setup for the next book. To judge it in this manner is to judge it fairly.<br /><br />So let's do that. Just because DANCE's (apparent) goal is to set things in motion doesn't meant it can't do so deftly. Two major plotlines emerge in DANCE: one in the north, and one in the east. While writing the book, Mr. Martin spoke frequently of untying the \\"Meereenese knot.\\" Unfortunately, he never successfully does so. Admittedly, I have never enjoyed Danerys as a character, but at least I found her actions to be logical from her standpoint. Meaning, that while I may not have agreed with her decisions, I understood how she might have made them. Not so in DANCE. As expected, DANCE follows several petitioners/rivals/suitors as they close in on Meereen. Yet Dany's actions and attitudes towards them are often confusing, and frequently seem to run counter to her supposed ideals and goals. The courses of these suitors are often confusing themselves as they move towards or away from Meereen and Dany without strong reason. The result is a muddle of explanation and motive that never becomes clear and ends with a move that looks promising, but also as if the last year may be erased when WINDS appears; about as satisfying as \\"This was all a dream\\" resolutions can be. The storyline in the north fares better. At and around the Wall, Stannis, the Watch, and the wildlings dance around Jon Snow, new Lord Commander and beset by all. Mr. Martin details Jon's difficulties well, but his forays south to Winterfell and White Harbour are on the skimpy side, as is his attention to Bran in the far north.<br /><br />I said this was a difficultone to write about, and it is. I find myself asking \\"What DID happen in all those pages?\\", and it's not an easy question to answer. Of course, there are a few shocking moments and twists, a couple extremely so. Yet the bogged-down feeling of the Meereenese knot extends even to characters and places that traditionally have worked well, or better than well. Tyrion, perhaps the most deeply-drawn of Martin's characters, feels at short shrift in DANCE; he doesn't have enough to do, and what he does do feels half-hearted. Occasionally we get a glimpse of his wit, bitterness, or tenderness, but not for long, and not enough. Stannis, Arya, Melisandre, Roose Bolton, Jaime, and Davos are touched on briefly but never given a chance to truly speak in the way we're used to hearing them. Cersei has one moving POV that does advance her story and display her character well. Perhaps the best-rendered POV is one of an old character, now returned: Mr. Martin demonstrates the changes wrought upon the character with the insight and rawness we have come to expect and love. In no other POV are we brought so well into a character's heart. A hallmark of Mr. Martin's writing is his ability to create initial shock and lingering sorrow. There is some of that in DANCE, but not enough. This is likely its main flaw: it holds us at such arm's length. After STORM's embrace, we can't help but feel a little colder.<br /><br />When I saw the first season of The Wire, I enjoyed it. But it wasn't until the second season that I was blown away. The brilliance of the second season made the skill used in the first season appear as mastery in the way it carefully constructed plot and character. It was as if the first season was only truly there to launch the real story, and not be the story itself. My belief, or hope, is that DANCE and FEAST are similar stones in the path; they are the boat and the crew, but not the WINDS that move them. Moving them will be a formidable task: the crew is enormous and the boat ungainly. Watching their assembly was enjoyable at times, but I'm waiting for the real voyage to start.
B003UESJEM|2.0|This is a surprisingly poor movie, marred by a flat script, incoherent character development and bad direction. Ben Affleck plays a well-paid salesman for a big corporation who is laid off without warning and within moments, we are deep into cliche land. He refuses to believe he will be jobless for long. He is snappy with his kids. He won't admit he has to sell his nice car. His saintly wife, as interesting and complex as a sheet of tissue paper, says she has faith in him. Affleck's two immediate bosses at the firm keep their jobs for the time being but are very hard to tell apart and my wife and I kept asking each other \\"So which one is that?\\" Other characters make so minor an impression that we couldn't figure out whether the nasty human resources woman who keeps firing people was having an affair with one of the senior bosses or not. Back in cliche land, Affleck is forced to take a building job offered to him by his brother-in-law and -- drum roll as we plunge deep into the dire heart of the movie -- he discovers there is more to slaving away for a corporation. He reconnects with his wife. He comes home early enough to play basketball with his disaffected son. He goes for a walk around the deserted ship yard his firm once ran and listens to one of his bosses talking about how great it was to actually make something. And before you know it, that boss has bought the yard, and gives Affleck and all his pals their jobs back. This film could have said a great deal about corporate wage slavery and what is happening to the U.S. job market but consistently pulls its punches and prefers to wander around in saccharine rather than dousing the topic in some well-needed vinegar. This was a major disappointment.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|I'll forgive a movie many (minor) faults if it is imaginative and has an ingenious script, and Limitless is that film. Down and out writer Eddie Morra bumps into his drug dealing ex brother-in-law, who introduces him to an amazing new substance which lets him access 100 percent of his brain as opposed to the 20 percent the rest of us have to make do with. Eddie quickly discovers his intelligence can bring in the dollars, so he wows his new stock-dealing friends and is soon on the verge of making serious money in the market. At this point the drawbacks and challenges emerge -- a Russian loanshark becomes more persistent and Eddie learns all about the side-effects of taking too much of the drug -- and the movie takes on a darker tone. I don't want to give too much away but the film doesn't disappoint and doesn't wimp out at the end. Recommended.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I've been listening to Fly From Here almost none stop since it's arrival in the mail from Amazon yesterday.  Yes, I'm one of those Yes fan-atics, ever since hearing All Good People in the early 70's.  I can hardly believe it, but I'm about to say Fly From Here may be the best Yes album ever, taken as a whole.  And this comment comes from one who considers Close to the Edge, The Yes Album, Fragile and 9015 (in that order) to be contenders for the number 1 spot in the Best of Yes Album category!  Yes, this particular set of songs takes a few listens to seep into you heart, mind and soul.  But, if you give it that chance, the subtle high points and masterful calming notes do light a flame of musical bliss inside of you. You'll find its lyrical and musical themes staying with you long after the listen. That's what's so special about this spectacular compilation of Yes soundscapes with influences stretching from their early 'classic' period through the Tales, Drama, 90125, Magnification and now current era of their ever changing but interestingly consistent explorations of rock's musical boundary land, so-called Progressive Rock!  If this work doesn't influence the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to finally recognize the huge influence Yes' musical geniuses have and are still having on the world of Rock music, it would be a sad commentary on the institution.  Whether you're a Yes fan-atic like me, or just someone looking for a great collection of new songs to enjoy, buy this CD!  You'll be saying, \\"Yes,\\" I'm glad I took a chance on this one!
0345457692|5.0|Altered Carbon is a masterpiece, a classic that is deserving of the highest praise. Richard K. Morgan has produced an exciting and highly creative book that from the first page immediately engages the reader and leaves you thirsting for the next page. I could NOT put this book down and found all aspects of the novel, particularly characterization and plot, to be highly enjoyable. I found myself laughing and cringing in equal measures but most of all I was compelled to uncover the mystery surrounding Laurens Bancroft's suicide. Takeshi Kovacs is a most memorable protagonist, a character of deep complexity that is both realistic and interesting. The technology of the novel is creative and the concept of stacks and sleeves added greatly to the complexity of the plot and the crime at the centre of it.    As a debut novel it is especially impressive and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a thrilling, enjoyable read.

B004EPYZU8|1.0|I'm a huge fantasy movie fan, and love comic-book style movies, so this was RIGHT up my alley.  Or, at least it would have been if it were not so repulsive.  I simply couldn't appreciate the gorgeous graphics and amazing acting behind the sick and twisted way that women were treated in this movie.  All I can say is thank heavens I rented it, and did not purchase it based on the genre hype.  I would hate to throw away something I'd just bought!  That said, however, if I had bought it, it would have gone straight into the trash regardless.  The victimization of this poor girl (and the others) was just too horrible for me to bear, in spite of her fighting it.  I would have LOVED this movie based on the graphics, acting, and \\"fight scenes\\" if the subject matter they chose didn't turn my stomach.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Ok so I went with some friends to see this movie when it hit the theaters back in April. This movie literally scared me silly. I jumped quite a few times. And then the scene with the boy inside the house dancing to the record player- hilarious! Personally, I think this movie followed your basic scary movie guideline. If it were not for the ending, which I TOTALLY did not see coming, I would've given it a 3 star rating. However due to the rating system here, I couldn't give it a 3.5. Instead it got a 4 star. Either way, watch the movie- during the daytime, w/other people around and be prepared to get no sleep!

B004WCTLNY|3.0|Damon & Blunt have pretty good chemistry, but the script's threadbare treatment of their romance doesn't give them much to work with. On the plus side, I liked the restrained effects work used in the \\"space jumps\\" through the doors. Terence Stamp is a natural for a MAD MEN guest spot. This should have been called THE ANGEL IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT. +1 for being less annoying then INCEPTION. 5/10

630218021X|4.0|Florid nonsense, but that's why we love Ken Russell. Everyone, especially Glenda Jackson, overacts gloriously except Richard Chamberlain as Tchaikovsky, who seems overwhelmed by all the chewed-up scenery, but isn't bad. The fantasy sequences are a riot of color and camera movement & cutting, but the 1812 Overture sequence, with the heads of Dick's enemies being blown off by cannons, really is a bit much. 7/10
1451629184|4.0|I am so glad that Jaycee decided to write this book. I have been so curious about her and story and she didn't let me down.    The beginning of the book, to me, is the most riviting part. I was on the edge of my seat with the tale of the kidnapping and horribly troubled by her grooming by that horrible man and her eventual sexual abuse. I grew to understand her not running away when she had the chance.     I am further amazed at the wonderful young woman she has become. It is definitely a choice she made to move on from this tragic event and I wish her all the best for the rest of her life.

Looking to avenge the death of his mother at the hands of the Tekken group, Jin (Foo) fights his way to the tournament.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  Very, very entertaining with very good fighting scenes.  It also stayed very close to the video game, complete with the pick-a-fighter sections.  The downfall of this movie is the same problem with all video game movies though.  When the movie is just the one-on-one fighting sequences like the game has it is very strong and fun to watch.  When it tries to add a story aspect and a plot is where it begins to drag.  But the filmakers knew this I think and the movie never strays too far from the tournament aspect for too long.  Overall, much better then I expected, and knowing it's a video game you will have certain expectations going in.  I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I actually might.<br /><br />*Also try - Muay Thai Fighter
044654759X|5.0|Wow, this is definitely one of the better Sparks books I've read, I sure hope he keeps going in this darker, less sappy direction with the next one too. I picked up SAFE HAVEN during a very busy time in my life and still found it unputdownable. Full of twists and turns, mystery and surprise and a HUGE suspense factor throughout. Of course we also get the romance (nicely done) and it again takes place in a small North Carolina town again (write what you know) but this was way darker then anything of Sparks' I've read before.<br /><br />The story slowly and deliciously unravels throughout so that we don't ever get a huge background dump with any of the characters multiple POV's instead their lives, secrets and issues are gradually introduced which I loved. And the bad guy here, jeez he was horrible, and I mean that in a good way. The kind of character that you love to hate, but I also really enjoyed getting into his head, as he slowly fell apart, very intriguing stuff and really well done. I highly recommended this one even for those non- Nicholas Sparks fans; I think you'll be surprised.<br /><br />The story here is somewhat reminiscent of A BEND IN THE ROAD but way better, it also reminded me very much of that older Julia Roberts movie Sleeping With The Enemy but again its better then that too. I won't give too much away here with the synopsis, its well worth discovering on your own. Cheers.<br /><br />Katie is on the run, but the good people of Southport don't know that they're just wondering what the pretty new waitresses' story is and why she keeps to herself so much, after all everyone here knows everybody else. For the first time in months Katie is allowing herself to breathe again, she's found a good paying job, a secluded place to live, and avoiding any personal ties should allow her time enough here to save some money before she has to move on again. What she hadn't counted on however was being drawn into the lives of anyone in this small town. First it was her outspoken single neighbour Jo, who only made her realize how much she missed having friends and then it was Alex, the widowed shop owner and his two adorable children. Slowly Katie is letting her guard down, growing attached and falling in love, allowing herself to dream of a future with a man that won't hurt her. But Kevin is good and he's on her trail.<br /><br />I've just learned that this is going to be made into a movie, can't wait.

I thought was very slow moving and a little boring.  This does not really work as a kids cartoon.  The opening scene will appeal to them, but the movie then becomes a full on western in the vane of \\"The Man With No Name\\" movies starring Clint Eastwood.  Very little action and a drawn out story line make this a little too adult for kids.  My eight year old loved the first half-hour, then got really bored and went to play outside.  My two year old who loves \\"Toy Story\\" and pretty much and cartoon was very disinterested in this. I did finish it to see how it ended, but that's the only reason.

0805086846|5.0|This is a book that apparently was sorely needed when it first came out, and it has continued to be so. To be honest, this perception, though probably factual, bothers me.  Did it really take Dee Brown finally to tell the real story about the so-called Indian wars in the United States? I learned about much of the material he presents in a series of books I read when I was eleven years old or so in a series of books in Germany. They were basically biographies of various chiefs, shamans, or entire tribes if warranted: Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull,the Seminoles, etc. I was devasted by Sheridan's declaration that \\"the only good Indian is a dead Indian\\" a decade or more before this book was published. Why was Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee an eye opener? Why does it continue to be so decades after its first publication? My hunch is this: at first it was due to the ongoing process of soft-pedaling the facts within a nation that was still subconsciously enamored with the idea of the \\"Manifest Destiny,\\" while nowadays, it's because the complexity of nineteenth-century American history does not allow itself to be jammed easily into a single formula of political correctness. Regardless of the reason, if you have not read this book or a similar one, I urge you to become acquainted with what his now our history, yours and mine.<br />Dee Brown writes this book from the vantage point of the Native Americans, and the product is anything but light reading. The saddest part, perhaps, is the seemingly endless repetition. Promises made, treaties signed,treaties not enforced, promises broken. Repeat. Brown does not specifically address the struggles, both internal and external, among U.S. leaders because the tribal leaders did not see them. But he is very careful in presenting an honest picture of the turmoil within the Native tribes and the philosophical differences among their own leaders, for example: Black Kettle, who would not take up arms due to his blind faith in the White Man's trustworthiness, Red Cloud, who combined negotiations with physical clout, or Sitting Bull, who would never agree to any negotiations. All them up faced the consistent challenge of controlling their own people, whose anger at times drove them to exacerbate their situation by giving the U.S. excuses for retaliation, frequently carried out against innocent people.<br />Even for someone who is fairly knowledgeable about the facts, because this book brings together so many stories, Bury My Heart becomes something of a cathartic experience. But catharsis should never be an end in itself. We need to go on from there and continue a rational process of reconciliation. Doing so is going to mean working with each situation on a case-by-case basis. May our manifest destiny now be that we stand out among the nations of the world as a country of justice and good will.stworthiness, Red Cloud, who combined negotiations with physical clout, or Sitting Bull, who would never agree to any negotiations.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|To AJ fans this movie would probably be great. The movie is unfairly compared with Bourn just because it borrowed Bourn's style and even some action ideas like crashing a SUV over the highway pass; but, overall it is just sub par compared with Bourn. The plot is interesting but unbelievable. How much spy training could a Russian spy master give to a bunch of little children besides brain washing? When these children become adults, how would they remain loyal to the Russian spy master after all these years without seeing him? Toward the ending Salt empties two out of four magazines from an automatic rifle against the wall trying to open the door to the nuclear missile launch chamber. Why doesn't she carries the same rifle with the remaining two magazines and enters the chamber to kill Ted Winter? Instead she carries a pistol with single clip and has a shootout with Ted Winter in the chamber. Obviously the director wants a fist fight between these two characters when both runs out of pistol bullets.  Another illogical plot is how Ted Winter thinks he will get away from trying to launch the missiles. Even the only witness, the US President, is knocked into coma and will never wake up to testify against him. The sub-machine gun Ted Winter used to kill those 7 staff members in the chamber has his finger prints all over which will incriminate him anyway. This movie is watchable for its action sequences if overlooking the plot holes.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|For those that enjoy the warm, sultry and retro voice of Imelda May, consider a tour over to Max Raabe and the Palast Orchester.  The Live at Carnegie Hall (and live in New York, DVD--check u-tube for video clips, seriously, now while you're thinking of it--just open another tab on your browser and u-tube search Max Raabe) is stupendous, retro, and a wonderful companion to the sultry May.  Both deserve a spot in your CD changer or iPod, and both Rabbe and May are true pioneers of their genre.  Max Raabe played at the wedding reception of Marilyn Manson.  God, he's good at what he does.  So stark, so expressionless.  The perfect coup-contracoup to Imelda May, who is more expressive than the tattooed fat lady at the traveling carnival.  But, oh, so much more comely.

B000FC1LOC|3.0|This book did keep me engaged and was an easy read.  I read it very quickly.  The problem I had is with the jumping around to different points of view and timelines.  I was constantly trying to figure out what time period the character was in and sometimes has to flip back to see what character was narrating.  The story was good, but definitely not 5 stars.
0553801473|3.0|ADWD was a loooong time in the waiting, and since the previous book was a character-driven travelogue, it was generally believed that this would make up for it with plenty of action and plot resolution. Not so. This, like A Feast For Crows, is 1000 pages of scenic character study.<br /><br />The characters travel about, and have immense conversations with other people. These conversations are fascinating, and you can see the characters develop (and not always for the best) as the book goes on. But action? Not that much. We have been invested with these amazing characters for 20 years now, so watching them develop is rewarding - but it seems to be at the expense of story momentum.<br /><br />By the end, we're not much further along in plot than we were by the end of Book 3. But it's now starting to become apparent that GRRM's focus is on character first and foremost, and plot must fit in the small gaps whenever the character is allowed to plateau for awhile.<br /><br />So the real standout storylines in this book are oddly, the ones with characters with the fewest chapters. Then, they have to be sharp, succinct, focused and dramatic. But the \\"Big Three\\" characters each get about a dozen chapters each, and as a result have bloated, fuzzy, rather impotent storylines, where they talk a lot and worry a good deal, and evolve or devolve as people, but don't get much further towards their respective goals.<br /><br />A great many new characters are introduced, but oddly, are not detailed that well. An important new figure in Dany's storyline, Hizdahr, is sketched so vaguely that you never get a sense of him at all, and care even less. It seems GRRM is too fascinated by the Big Three to be much interested in the lesser roles.<br /><br />GRRM's writing style can be visceral, beautiful, haunting, unforgettable. But his weakness is wandering away into asides that are full of description and backstory, and that tendancy seems to be getting much stronger with each passing book. His editor apparently reveres him too much to call a halt to the endless minutiae. Allowing for that, how he proposes to tie up all the myriad loose ends in two more books is beyond me. I can't see it happening. This feels at the moment like it may turn into a never-ending series.<br /><br />I'm still a massive fan and would recommend the series as a whole - there are too many moments of beauty not to. But I may not be first in the queue next time, as I was for this one. I have re-adjusted my expectations somewhat.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|-----NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW------------<br /><br />Having just finished this book, I am a little bit surprised to see all the negative reviews.  Although after reading them all, I can see their points of views.  However, I still believe GRRM has not lost his way and this story is just as compelling as the first 3.<br /><br />Many people think this story moves along slowly, and there is a whole lot of nothing and dialogue going on for much of the story.  I can't say that isn't true, but I don't think it's a bad thing.  The thing you have to remember is although this whole story is set in a fantasy setting, GRRM still tries to keep his characters, actions and reactions as human and realistic as possible.  Where  most authors will see it through the end that important characters will persevere, GRRM has no qualms with killing them off to progress the story.  So with all the crazy whirlwind of events that have passed in the first 3 books, there is going to be periods of downtime, much like in real life.<br /><br />A Storm of Swords ended with the Tyrion murdering Tywin and leaving King's Landing in chaos, Stannis and his army coming to save the Night Watch at the wall, Jon becoming the new Lord Commander and giving quarter to Stannis, Daenerys deciding to settle down in Mereen after laying waste to the other slave towns, and all the Stark children splitting off into the unknown (and much much more).  After all that, what's to be expected?  Obviously the pace and action won't be able to continue.  At King's Landing, we'll have to see how all the characters pick up the aftermath of Tyrion's actions.  At the Wall, we will have to see how Jon settles into his new position and see how Stannis will plan his next actions now that he has a small foothold in the north.  Across the Narrow Sea, we'll have to see how Daenerys will handle actually trying to rule a city.  These events following the fallout of A Storm of Swords is obviously going to not be as action packed.  However I truly believe that this story is just as much about character development as the lore.  So while A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons may lack the amount of action that some readers are looking for, it's still very very rich in character development, which I have enjoyed greatly.<br /><br />Also I think all the random characters that gets introduced for a few chapters are refreshing.  One of the appeals of these books are all the different point of views that GRRM introduces.  At least in my opinion, it feels like outside of Joffrey and Cersei, he does intentionally try to portray any side of the war as being the good guys or bad guys.  They just are what they are, people fighting for their side of the war.  Reading the story from one person's point of view will lead to bias on which side is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", so I welcome GRRM introducing some new perspectives to the story here and there.  I really believe it only helps enriches the story.<br /><br />With all that said, I do believe A Dance with Dragons is deserving of a 5/5 rating.  Although it lacks the action and pace of the first 3 books, it still does a spectacular job developing all the characters.  But most importantly, by the end of the book, it has moved and set up all the pieces in this game for the Iron Throne for what should be a truly epic final 2 books.<br /><br />Winter isn't coming anymore....it has arrived!

031603441X|5.0|I LOVED this book.  It is 536 pages, and I enjoyed everyone of them.  I've read a lot of books, I am addicted to reading, I always have to have SOMETHING to read.  And I've read a lot of crap, and of course, a lot of really excellent material, and everything in between.  But I am SO GLAD that I took the time to read this book, it is excellent.    The fact that I am a musician, and a Rolling Stones fan from way back certainly doesn't make me an impartial judge.  But I stand by my assessment; excellent.    I never knew much about Keith except he was the BAD BOY, junkie, funky guitar player who supposedly had all his blood swithed out; like an oil change; in order to get off the junk (a fairy tale), and that he had his head smashed by a cocoanut when he was climbing a tree somewhere in the south Pacific (another fabrication).    I took all these lies to be truths; I thought Keith was just a lucky guy who happened to be Mick's guitar player, and song writing buddy.  I drank the kool-aid, I fell for the media hype; hook, line and sinker.    After reading this thoroughly entertaining book; I know Keith is someone I would love to be freinds with, even if he was just a poor guitar player who eked out a living playing in local bars.  Keith tells you his version of the truth so candidly, so bluntly, that you just believe it.    I'm sure that not evey single word is the truth, we're all human, and Keith surely did a little bit of spin control when telling his version of the crazy stories we've all heard.  But who you gonna believe? A guy that couldn't really give a hoot what anyone thinks, (and therefore has nothing to loose); or the MEDIA? Which hardly ever tells the truth when it comes to the lives of Rock Stars, Famous Actors and so forth.  The media lives for scandal.  So, I believe Keith.    By the end of the book you feel like you know this guy intimately, like you just made a new best freind.     Keef: Thanks for sharing with us, and thanks for all the great music. May you make beautiful music till you drop; because I know that is they way you'd prefer to live and die. Sincerely.
0553801473|2.0|Intro<br /><br />After the reading of ADWD I was so numbed by the outrage and disappointment that I was unable to identify the true reason for such feelings. That was six days ago, so I have substantially cooled down and managed to sort my impressions in the more rational fashion. My disappointment stems form my ill founded expectations, which are based on the quality of the first three books, almost eleven years of meager development of ASOIAF series, and neglecting the true proportions of catastrophic consequences of AFFC. I think I have found a more or less reasonable explanation for its present form, even its plausible purpose in ASOIAF series. And I still don't like it.<br /><br />Devil's advocate<br /><br />First of all, ASOIAF is projected as a seven book series, approximately 800 pages per book, so it is not realistic to expect ending of all major storylines (Tyrion, Dany, Jaime, Cersei, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Jon) sooner than the end of the seventh book. I'm pointing this out because many fans (myself included) have raised the question whether GRRM knows how to finish a storyline. He definitely does - the only problem is that most of the major storylines are going to span through entire series.<br /><br />As an aftermath of the war of five (or six?) kings, which ended with the ASOS, it was logical to cool down a bit and redeploy the major players for the upcoming Ice versus Fire clash. However, GRRM manage to make a huge mistake and seriously mess up ASOIAF series with that miserable decision to put the whole logistics into two books. Hence, instead of one OK book, he produced a 700 pages long boredom generator AFFC. In addition, GRRM managed to fail to deliver ADWD in 2006 - a cataclysmic mistake.<br /><br />As a consequence, he placed himself between hammer and anvil: on the hammer side, fans and publishers were constantly pushing him to finish, with increasing intensity as years has passed by; on the anvil side, AFFC has tied his hands with respect to the plot progression - he can go as far as the beginning of the winter.<br /><br />This unpleasant situation has sprouted some serious problems:<br /><br />1. The Others need winter in order to invade the North, so the principal conflict in the series cannot kick in. This considerably limits Jon's actions - he can just stay on the Wall and somehow try to increase the ranks of the Night watch. Recall that leaders of Westeros consider NW as a place to exile criminals and political opponents, not as actual defense against the ancient enemy (they actually believe that Others never existed and that the Wall is just an extravagance of Brandon the builder), so they have neglected the NW for a long time (at least decades, probably centuries);<br /><br />2. How to develop Dany? On the one hand, the book is titled \\"A dance with dragons\\", so it is pretty much mandatory to expect a large portion of the narrative devoted to Dany and her dragons. Besides, fans would probably demanded GRRM's head had he failed to deliver less than seven chapters on Dany. On the other hand, she cannot be expected in Westeros sooner that the last book, there is not enough time for some serious events (the upper limit is beginning of winter), so the reasonable number of chapters available for Dany is no more than three;<br /><br />3. The main characters of AFFC (Jaime, Brienne, Cersei, Sam, Arya, Sansa, Asha, Aeron, Areo Hotah and Victarion) can either be omitted, or barely mentioned - a consequence of their earlier development in AFFC and the time limit (beginning of winter).<br /><br />This time-limit obstacle has imposed difficulties with development of the other characters as well. Enough with advocacy, the time for trashing has come.<br /><br />Agent Bran<br /><br />Considering Bran, I am disappointed with the resolution of his journey to three-eyed crow. Firstly, the three-eyed crow is a man almost turned to a tree, which is too much Treebeardish for my taste. Secondly, Bran's greenseer training looks like rewriting of Neo's training in the Matrix: Bran eats wheirwood paste, which is a part of the plug-in process, they plant him in the \\"gear\\" and he starts to browse Matrix/wheirwood database of the past and present events. Combined with the skin-changer skills, he becomes \\"agent Bran\\" (in terms of technical performance of the agent Smith within the Matrix). I understand the logic behind this - Bran is the actual warden of the North and the Matrix-agent type of skills would facilitate this role perfectly. Still, I would be much, much happier with the substantially longer and more mystical/religious training.<br /><br />Parlor Mel<br /><br />Considering Mel, I'll start with the following quote:<br /><br />&lt;&lt; Food. Yes, I should eat. Some days she forgot. R'hllor provided her with all the nourishment her body needed, but that was something best concealed from mortal men.<br />...<br />While the boy was gone, Melisandre washed herself and changed her robes. Her sleeves were full of hidden pockets, and she checked them carefully as she did every morning to make certain all her powders were in place. Powders to turn fire green or blue or silver, powders to make a flame roar and hiss and leap up higher than a man is tall, powders to make smoke. A smoke for truth, a smoke for lust, a smoke for fear, and the thick black smoke that could kill a man outright. The red priestess armed herself with a pinch of each of them. The carved chest that she had brought across the narrow sea was more than three-quarters empty now. And while Melisandre had the knowledge to make more powders, she lacked many rare ingredients. My spells should suffice. She was stronger at the Wall, stronger even than in Asshai. Her every word and gesture was more potent, and she could do things that she had never done before. Such shadows as I bring forth here will be terrible, and no creature of the dark will stand before them. With such sorceries at her command, she should soon have no more need of the feeble tricks of alchemists and pyromancers.<br /><br />Martin, George R.R. (2011).

From my point of view, this is a material mistake (both GRRM's and editorial) in the portraying of Mel. I see Mel as a powerful cleric of R'hllor and would expect her consistent development in that direction.<br /><br />Sookie Targaryen<br /><br />Considering Dany, I think that GRRM has failed miserably. As I said before, Dany cannot be expected in the Westeros before the seventh book and AFFC has tightly tied GRRM's hands with respect to the plot progression (he can go as far as the beginning of the winter, no further). As a consequence, I don't see any reason (from the overall plot point of view) to give more chapters to Dany than to Arya or Bran. Three chapters would serve the purpose quite well. GRRM chose to stretched the logical development from three to ten chapters. I don't like the result: this Meereen version of Dany reminds me of Sookie Stackhouse - a cute, incredibly stupid blonde from the HBO True Blood show. Now I'm unable to think of Meereen version of Dany as Daenerys Targaryen, but as Sookie Targaryen. Yuck!<br /><br />The narrative<br /><br />Let me put it bluntly - the book has around 500 pages more than the actual events covered in it deserve. As a consequence, instead of reasonably OK 500 pages book, we have been served with a supreme generator of boredom, a masterpiece on stalling, a PhD on dragging and meandering, a slap in the face, a heap of dung, a catastrophic failure.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />If I have to compare ADWD with AFFC, then my vote goes to AFFC since it is significantly shorter. Of course, the last two installments of ASOIAF series have seriously chipped the overall quality. I think that the main reason is a lousy decision to split the entire logistics in two books. The only remedy is that GRRM majorly revise this two books and merge them into a single book with the upper limit of 800 pages (of course, that's not going to happen).<br /><br />Can I recommend ADWD? Barely, with the following warnings:<br /><br />1. Don't by it unless you want to a priori support GRRM's work. Otherwise, you'll probably feel cheated (after you finish the reading);<br /><br />2. Be careful about your expectations: ADWD will advance the plot only to the beginning of winter, no further. This genuinely small advance is heavily stretched on 1000 pages.of the feeble tricks of alchemists and pyromancers.<br /><br />Martin, George R.R. (2011).

B004ULEEY8|3.0|This movie is filled with non-stop action, but was not all that exciting to watch.  Most of the movie is very loud, to the point where you cannot hear the voices of the actors.  It does live up to it's name, it is one long battle.  This is one movie that I could have waited until it came out on cable to watch.  The battle could have been more interesting.  I kept waiting for it to get better.
B005529BDK|3.0|Works and runs great on Samsung Vibrant with Froyo. However, sometimes when I flip the coins to go for the combo or to save myself from death, it usually ends in disaster. WHY?!?!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This film showed what irreversible damage has been done to our society and its people  by the venal few, when allowed free reign and without regulation. There are some wonderful points made. Moore gives numerous and fascinating vignettes of the tragic consequences of the powerful and greedy on ordinary lives. He comes over as a believer in the original principles of the founding father's of America, and in the principles that guide christian belief. He quite rightly plays the innocent abroad,a man curious to find out the truth - only because it is an effective way to communicate without layering the whole film with a personal diatribe of 'his own views'. He lets us make up our minds based on evidence we might not have been aware of before.       His repeated call at the end of the  film for 'us' to \\"DO SOMETHING\\" was spot on. I particularly liked the point about the scientist, Salk,  who discovered the Polio vaccine and refused to patent it for his own self interest. He could have been hugely wealthy, but rightly, gave the vaccine to the State to serve the people and save lives.  He personified the kind of rare selflessness that humanity needs now and much more than we might recognise.      I have come to really appreciate Michael Moore.  His stuff is deadly serious delivered under the guise of the questioning buffoon. It is brave, well researched, and deeply moving. He knits together a story of corporate greed and Government simony, with the dreadful impacts on individuals lives-particularly the voiceless poor. He uses eclectic examples which at first you don't think can be relevant, but successfully shows how unchecked Capitalist greed reaches into all areas of society. For example -he highlights news stories that pass by so rapidly in today's fast news agenda, to pull together the most damning indictment of the system's failure and horrors. There is the young people's correctional institution which makes the point so well. Here we are introduced to an $8 millionfacility, leased to State authorities. Moore interviews four young people, stunned and damaged by their experiences. Many of them were locked up for three times as long as their sentence allowed for minor infringements for which they should have only received a telling off. We meet vulnerable young people who were locked up for smoking a joint, or the girl who created a website that criticised the deputy head teacher at her school. They were locked up by a corrupt judge who lengthened sentences at will. They were sent to this private, for-profit correctional institution because the Judge was paid. The judge got paid for sending them customers!!! This was child abuse. It was stunningly shocking. Then we had the life insurances taken out on workers' lives by companies. They benefited from workers' deaths.      There were a few stories of co-operative working which lifted the spirits -the co operative bakers and other workers facing unemplpyment, who showed how things could be done differently.      The spotlight turned to the banks and their relationship with Government. The behaviour of the democratic party in supporting the Republican led $70 billion bailout was exposed. Paulson, Goldman Sachs, and their control of the Executive in Government still leaves me speechless however many times I hear about it. The stream of foreclosures, through state after state- were spotlighted. We saw the despair of the sick, elderly small farmer , encouraged to refinance who finds his payments doubling then tripling. He is evicted with nowhere to go. We see how refinancing was packaged and sold by such companies as Countrywide. The former farmer and his wife earn their last dollars by empyting their own home for the finance company who had sold it to someone else. It was cheaper for the company if the evicted couple cleared the house than to hire a professional house clearance company. The couple desperately needed the small amount of money this brought. This was a lesson in the ultimate humiliation which rampant greedy Capital and its officials are prepared to deliver. Talk about putting the boot in. Truly heartbreaking.   These tragic stories are countered with stories of fighting back. (We see the homeless Miami family taking over an empty property backed by community support.) But the fighting back has not really begun in earnest yet.     People talk about Moore being wealthy now from making movies.  I am glad he is wealthy. He can use the money to make more movies. He is still of the people. Money can often divorce people from their roots, but that hasn't happened to Moore yet. He is still the only one making populist rather than elitist documentaries that successfully communicate with the many. That Michael Moore was able to make this movie in America gives hope. Made in 2009, it needs updating, particularly on Obama's hands being tied by Capital's lobbying powers.     Moore offers a more popular and accessible overview of derivatives. It is an everyman's guide,which is necessary. He does it very well. ( For a clearer focus on the causes of the financial crash and the individuals in banks and their links with Government, see 'Inside Job'. This is a very good fast-paced and detailed doc made in 2010 which looks at the causes of the failures and on the actions of bankers and their friends in Government. It takes a more detailed look at packaged derivatives, Credit Default Swaps, Credit Default Obligations and Ratings agencies).       Many Americans have been brainwashed into believing that Socialism equals Communism and that Stalin was a socialist. Socialism has always meant Capitalism with a social face. What is wrong with that? There were a lot of people in this programme who caused this crisis and who actually loathe socialism because it shares out profits. (There is one rich man who says on camera that he won;t give up a piece of his pie. \\"I want all my pie\\" he says. I hope it chokes him.  Socialism is not an economic system. Capitalismis. But Capitalism can only survive if it serves the interests of all people not a few as we are now seeing. Capitalism can't survive in a country that has ever increasing unemployment and low wages. Who buys the goods?     The sovereign debt crisis has not played out yet. That will be the next chapter in Capital's crisis. More Moore of this kind of vintage please.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Works and runs well on Samsung Vibrant running Froyo but the programming disallows for smooth play. I'm unable to control where and when my character shoots, especially with the shotgun. Not to mention the levels get really hard really fast when you can't shoot through holes our accidentally pick up a shotgun in a horde of 80+. Great game otherwise.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The animation is amazing.  I never tiring of looking at the exactness of the animation to reality.  The story is magical, but still has the realness of relationships between mother & son, child & child.
0439023483|5.0|I was instantly hooked on this book from the first page.  It's a great story of love and oppression.  I recommend this to adults also.  As soon as I finished this one, it was straight to the next book in the trilogy.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|I thought this movie was a lot of fun.  The cover failed to convey what the movie was about.  A front view of a black charger with Nick and Amber in it with hell in the background would have been clearer to me but I am a graphic artist by trade so I have to put in my two cents.  Again, this was not what I expected but the concept (spoiler) of Nick Cage as an escaped damned soul stealing a magic gun from hell and escaping to save his daughter from a crazy cultist who would sacrifice his only daughter is great.  William Fichtner as the devil tracker (The Accountant) was amazing, I will never look at the song \\"That's the way I like it\\" by K.C. and the Sunshine band again.  Also the \\"Doing it\\" and \\"Doing people with a gun\\" scene was great, I never saw a scene like that before.  I do wish Amber's role was more integrated with the story and not in the sexist roles you see for women: the babe, the bate, the mother.  Personally I wish she was the actual mother from heaven, coming to help.  I guess that would change the story quite a bit and leave the child parentless unless David Morse's character lived and took the child but I think he would make a nice dad character.  He played a caring soul.  Of everyone I thought William Fichtner's role was the best.  Every second he was on the screen he did something funny, crazy or both.  I laughed so hard it hurt.  Personally I thought he was the star of the show and very well cast.  He did so much with the role.
1451629184|5.0|I hesitate to call it a \\"good book\\", because of the situation on which it was based.  However, I feel Jaycee did an excellent job telling her story.  She is obviously above average in intelligence, articulation, and bringing her feelings across on paper.  It is very well written.  She is candid, and open, and I as a reader appreciate that.  I appreciate not just reading hints, or having to guess or assume the facts.  What was done to her was nothing short of horrific, and I'm so glad to see she survived, and is blessed.  It's not just about what happened to her, but about her feelings, before, during and after, and her healing.  It was very tastefully done, and very considerate and thoughtful with having her girls in mind.  If she does decide to become a writer of fiction, it proves promising.<br /><br />Jaycee, if you ever get to read this, I want to say thank you for sharing your story, thank you for being brave enough to share your story.  Thank you for being an advocate for others in similar situations.  I know you have a long way to go, and I hope what Phillip did to you does not forever turn you away from the Lord.
1451629184|4.0|To hear this story told by the little girl who lived it illustrates better than anything I've read how monsters like Phillip Garrido actually groom their victims to do their will.  For those who ask, \\"Why didn't she just run away,\\" I say read Jaycee's account of the days, weeks, years of physical, emotional and sensory deprivation that stole away her own will. Jaycee's account or the challenge of trying to overcome those lost years and regain the person she was meant to be is inspiring.  I found it fitting that the somewhat childlike writing at the beginning gives way to more adult perspectives as the book proceeds, just as the little girl grows into a woman.  I thank Jaycee for sharing her life in this way.  Her account is bound to help others understand how to help those who have lived through such a horrendous experience.  She thanks her rescuers, therapist, family and others for their participation in her recovery.  I'd like to say thank you too.  I'm glad you people exist and are willing to help.  It is proof, that unlike Phillip Garrido's view of the world, most of us are here to support rather than exploit and love rather than use. Best of luck to Jaycee and her family.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I really like books that give you a history of a business. I especially like books that give you a history of technology businesses because they are usually so current. This is exactly the case with this book.<br /><br />Many have heard about what makes Google tick but this book take your behind the scenes from day one and reveals what makes the place tick. It demonstrates how Google is really an extension of the personalities of Sergey and Larry. Reading the book helps you to better understand why Google does the things that it does and its whole approach to business. This is extremely beneficial given that fact that most people use a Google product every day.<br /><br />The book is well written, easy to read and very entertaining as it takes you through the history of Google, dwelling on the major moments and products that have made it the colossus that it is today. It is very interesting to see how major products like Gmail grew from extreme small, almost hobby like projects into the features of mass culture they are today.<br /><br />Most importantly of all it it gives you fantastic insight into the way Google thinks, how it make decisions and most importantly what it sees its mission in the world. As they say, knowing is understanding and with this book you'll certainly be more knowledgeable about what makes Google tick.
B0052ADN16|5.0|My friends and I have so much fun playing this game, it is very simple and easy to learn.  Great for all ages, and family nights, there are many different variations that fans have made, and that Mayfair games has made, there are expansions for the game so that more players can play and new objectives, it is one of my favorite games of all time.  I will chose a night of Catan with friends over almost any movie, or video game hands down.
B00003CX5P|5.0|From a true fan of Star Wars    The \\"phantom menace\\" was to me what \\"a new hope\\" was to the baby boomers. The original trilogy was about Luke Skywalker. The new trilogy is about the Jedi and Anakin Skywalker. The new trilogy is almost like what Jesus was to the pharasee's, but Jesus was God and thus Star Wars the new trilogy is Star Wars. The truth is that a lot of reviewers get it wrong and dont understand what Star Wars is truly about. The opening credits give it away. Star Wars is about \\"in a galaxy far far away.\\" Star Wars is a universe that anything could happen in: people, plot, etc. It is not limited to Luke Skywalker. Also if the Star Wars pharisees(those who hated the prequels) actually looked into the back stories of each of the characters then the prequels match up. The truth be said, all the Star Wars pharisee's dont truly like Star Wars. They like the image of Star Wars, but not the true spirit of Star Wars. When I saw Episode 1 in theaters I was like \\"wow! This is great\\" The movie started out perfectly too. I loved it up until the end and I had seen the original trilogy too. My grown mother liked it and she was a huge Star Wars. But then again thats the reaction you get from a really Star Wars fan and not a fake Star Wars fan. Also I find it funny how people argue the stupidness of the new trilogy when in reality the original trilogy had so much more stupidity in it then the new trilogy. Also with episode 2, I really think that the reason why the romance between Anakin and Padame seemed horrible was because all George Lucas was doing was showing how dumb people can be at romance, even in a galaxy far far away. George Lucas, you ARE a genius.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Every now and then, a film comes along and reminds you of the way it used to be. Back in the eighties, blockbusters were made with heart. Everything from the acting to the direction was top-notch, especially if the film in question was a Spielberg film. Steven Spielberg is one of the best film directors in the industry. His love of the medium shines in just about every project that he has been a part of. Some of the most influential films of the past have his name attached to them, namely E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jurassic Park. He deals with fantastical themes with a heartfelt, childlike curiosity - a definite trademark that appears in many of his films. Recently, director J.J. Abrams made a film which can be seen as a love letter to Spielberg. This film is `Super 8', and it is one of the best offerings of the summer, as well as one of the best films of the year. And, for those of you who have followed me over the past two years, the mere fact that I am glowing over a mainstream blockbuster is nothing short of a miracle.     The film opens in Lillian, Ohio in 1979, and follows a group of close-knit boys during summer break, as they attempt to film a zombie flick with a Super 8 camera. Young Joe Lamb has recently lost his mother in a steel mill accident, and as a way to cope with his loss, he vows to help his best friend, the film-obsessed Charles, complete his latest cinematic masterpiece. Together with three other boys, and his latest crush, Alice, Joe slowly begins a journey of self-discovery. Everything changes one night during a film shoot, when the boys witness, and barely manage to escape, a horrific train wreck. The kids flee the site, as the U.S. Air Force arrives.    This leads to strange phenomena in the town; pets running away from their owners, the disappearance of car engines and power lines, and people being abducted. Soon after, the boys discover some disturbing footage which was caught during the train crash, while the camera wasstill rolling film. Something crawls up out the wreckage, and dashes out of the frame. The boys decide to delve into the mystery themselves, and the adventure begins.     The performances in this film are amazing, especially from newcomer Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, and Elle Fanning. Each delivers an incredibly genuine performance, and I was blown away by the raw energy displayed on screen. The direction is perfect, with splashes of J.J. Abrams idol, Spielberg, splashed about the screen in nearly every frame. The musical score is magical. The mystery is involving. It all makes for an excellent time at the theatre, and will make you long for the days when summer blockbusters had a soul. With strong messages of hope and forgiveness, it is also one of the most touching films to come out in a while.     Super 8 is rated PG-13, and is 112 minutes.

B004QSQML8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, i really like the high fantasy lore. while i may not be a huge Tom Cruise fan, esp how strange he`s become in his later years, i still like how he played his charecter well. I think how Ridley scott made his vision come too life was beyond reproach. i liked how lovable every charecter was including the bad guys. i would highley recomend this movie too any fan of high fantasy.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I didn't know much about this movie when I bought it and had never remembered seeing a preview for it either. I love horror movies and rarely think most of the movies out lately are even creepy. If you are expecting something like Paranormal Activity (PA) this doesn't really even compare, it doesn't have home video cameras and is a lot smoother. The movie reminds me more of a modern version of Poltergeist with a hint of PA in it. It keeps you wondering what will happen next, yes even at the end of the movie! I love the way the plot ran and the fact that the scenes were dimly lit.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|How one very strong little girl coped with immensely abusive circumstances and became a survivor. This book is a brutally graphic, and straitforward retelling of Jaycee Dugard's 18 years in captivity. I could not put this book down. When I was not reading it, I was thinking about it. A haunting story that will stay with you for quite some time. (Thanks for telling us your story Jaycee.)
0553801473|4.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />I don't know how to feel about this book. I don't know that I like it any better or any worse than A Feast for Crows, which was my least-favourite book of the series thus far. And I was, if not expecting, at least hoping to like this one a lot better, because I so many more of my favourite characters were in this one. And there were certainly parts I enjoyed a lot. But there were a lot of parts that frustrated me, a lot of parts that bored me, and a lot of parts that felt completely extraneous. It's definitely in need of judicious editing. I sort of get the feeling that his editors, so happy to have him finally declare it finished, didn't actually spend much time editing before sending it to print. Apart from a lot of unnecessary repetition and a lot of extraneous material, I also found five typos.<br /><br />So, overall -- I'm giving this 3.5 because I just sort of don't know what to do with it. There were quite a few moments that genuinely excited me. But there were a lot of things that frustrated me, that needed editing, or that should've been held off till the next book. And there are so many things left unanswered, so many arcs that began in this book or in Feast that have yet to see any kind of fulfillment whatsoever... Well, I guess we're in for another five or six frustrating years until The Winds of Winter comes out.<br /><br />Full, spoiler-heavy review at: [...]
0739375970|5.0|This is an excellent book (audio) that meets all the standards: unpredictability (like life), good people doing stupid things, good people doing good things and so on. Martin's well woven tapestry covers a land that is fascinating to visit but I wouldn't want to live there. Oh no! The best part of this series is being able to visit such a world; the worst part is now it will be years before we can get back in. For those people who are disappointed I can offer no solace except the knowledge that there is always another book in the offing. For folks like me, it is indeed a great ride. Characters you love to hate end up being sympathetic and you actually root for certain people to succeed while only a few hundred pages before you'd like to see them burned--and you'd gladly toss the torches yourself. The book does move the plot lines along in a way that is almost medieval in pace and yet the point of view chapters help to keep the world spinning and show the characters as fresh and as complex as they appear to be, and so they are.<br /><br />Jon Snow, Ariya, Dani, Tyrion are characters for the ages.<br /><br />My major concern with the series is a familiar one. At well past sixty, I may not be around to see this masterpiece serial finished. I never heard of \\"Game of Thrones\\" until the HBO series and read all the books soon after, waiting for this one to come out. I shall have fun trying to anticipate what winter will bring and look forward to rereading (and listening) to the entire series again a month or two before the next book arrives.<br /><br />A word about the audio: Roy Dotrice is excellent, way better than the fellow they paid to read the previous book. Dotrice and Jim Dale (Harry Potter series) are of the same ilk and if you have read the books and are still hungry for more, try the audio series because they provide a different and yet satisfying experience.
0545259088|5.0|Wonderful conclusion. Lots of action & excitement along with the beautiful love between Sam & Grace. Some parts brought tears to my eyes from the sadness, others from relief or happiness. Of course, I wish everyone could've had a perfectly happy ending, but that doesn't make for a very exciting read, does it?<br />I'm grateful for the conclusion, but also feeling some huge disappointment because it was the end of the series. I will miss Sam & Grace - but I'm glad to have their complete story on my shelf to read again and again
0553801473|5.0|There's a lot that I wanted to happen in this book. There's a lot I expected to happen in this book. None of it happened. None of it. And I mean that in the best possible way. A lot happens in this book, a LOT happens, but hardly any of it what you expect/wish, and that keeps you on your toes. Characters who seemed to previously have \\"Plot Armor\\" and rampant success after rampant success, are brought low and humbled, as they find themselves in new commands that may just be beyond them. Characters whose purpose had been served and finished, have been given new life and a story. A character who seemed destined to succeed and conquer from book 1 has suffered major failings, while another character who was previously one of the most despised in the series is made sympathetic. New players come out of left field, goals are left unfinished and may never be due to the harsh unfair world in which this takes place. And it moves. Much of that movement is interior to the characters, and some of it in the plot, and some of it is just a moving of ideas as the pieces move across the board. The cliffhangers are in abundance but this is book 5 of 7, so the third act will start in the next book, and we'll hopefully get to a centering on Westeros at some point towards the end of 6.<br /><br />Right now many fans are angry at this book and at Martin, and I can see why. But if you are not the kind to step back and watch your expectations of what will happen be dashed, you may end up angry as well. However if you are patient, and you allow the falters of the characters and the storylines to be as magnificent as the triumphs, you will love this book as much as I did.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I saw this movie on Hallmark, and fell in love. True story. We named our new shitzu afer him.   It is a tear jerker. Great for the whole fam.
1594744769|4.0|This book had me after reading the first chapter, and I could hardly put it down! It is an amazing story of unending love and acceptance of all people, peculiar or not.  I finished in two days while on a beach trip, and my mother did as well.  The pictures are amazing, and they fit in the storyline perfectly.  Even the book binding is done in such a way to make you feel like you are \\"in\\" the story.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The book is extremely difficult to read.  The graphic details are disturbing, moreso knowing that it is based on a true story.  What I enjoyed most about the book was that at the end of each chapter, Jaycee provides a \\"Reflections\\" section, analyzig, in retrospect, the situation that occurred in that chapter.  I also enjoyed her analysis on policy relating to the parole system, making public the various flaws present in the current system; hopefully policymakers and government officials will take her perspective seriously to make serious changes in the state's approach with dealing with sex offenders.  Lastly, I enjoyed the last chapters dedicated to her rehabilitation, explaining the types of treatments she and her family have undergone to make it through.    All in all, an excellent book of survival, strength, and hope.  Though beware on who you lend the book to - graphic details are disturbing.
1582701709|5.0|The book \\"Secret\\" is all I thought it would be and more.  I've had to go back and read certain parts of the book to really grasp the true meaning for me.  A good purchase. One for my collection.
030746363X|4.0|Packed with many ways to improve different aspects of your life, I found this book informative and easy to understand.  I've been following the diet for almost 2 weeks and have lost about 8 lbs.  Haven't moved on to the other parts of the book yet.  Overall I would recommend purchasing for the diet alone.  Although if you already know how to follow the South Beach diet, his diet is a simplified version of that.
0525951652|5.0|Thanks so much, Ken! You made such an absorbing and understandable portrayal of all that precipitated the Great War and then engulfed the world in it until ten million deaths was deemed enough to bring the insanity to a close. And your creation and interweaving of an international cast of characters who could bring out nobility and corruption throughout the social hierarchies in the different countries involved more than makes up for the sometimes stretched coincidences that kept them all connected with each other. A marvellous read! Can't wait for vols 2 and 3!
0811869261|5.0|I can't get enough of this book! Every time I look at it, I find something new. The images are beautiful and the colors are so vibrant! It explores different animals as well as customs in different parts of the world with simple, yet humorous dialogue. Plus there are great cling stickers inside the book which adds an activity factor. I would highly recommend it.  You will enjoy every page!

B005AUWY90|5.0|Let me start by saying that I didn't have high hopes for this movie.  I thought there was no way that they could make it as good as the original and I wasn't sure how they would pull it off.  If you expect it to be just like Cars and have all of the same characters, of course you will be disappointed.  I think that this movie was a great sequel.  They had plenty of action and plenty of Mater's antics.  Most of the original characters have small parts, but Lightning McQueen, Mater, Luigi, Guido, Sarge and Fillmore are in it throughout the movie.  I don't want to say much about it because I wouldn't want to ruin it for others, but I absolutely loved the plot and all of the new characters that were introduced in this one.  There was plenty of action, adventure and fun.  I think that the reason some people don't like it is because it isn't what they expected.  Honestly, I didn't know what to expect either, but Pixar exceeded my expectations, once again!  I think this is a great addition to the Pixar family and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This series makes the life and times of Henry VIII, his wives, and the politics of church and state so real.  You get a real flavor for how it would be to live in that period. With the discs it is easy to follow the story line at your leisure. The acting and the story are superb. The film is not appropriate for children because of the adult content. It is beautifully packaged. I haven't seen the additional information discs yet, but I'm looking forward to them.  This is a series that you will want to see again and again and it would make a terrific gift.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This concert is the best presentation of classical and modern opera featuring three artists that I have viewed.  The orchestra accompaniment is suburb and the conductor is most impressive and the setting is spectacular.  This DVD is a must-see.
B0055D3EOG|1.0|I originally had seen previews on TV and a spot in EW that both gave me the idea that this would be a really scary and creepy movie.  The cast also kind of lead me to believe it would be decent, I mean Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrn and Barbara Hershey are all fantastic actors.  For the life of me though I just don't understand why anyone would consider this movie good or scary.    As some people have mentioned, the first half of the movie and the second half of the movie are almost totally different plot lines.  When the family moves to the second house the plot just takes this huge leap from demonic possession/haunting to astral-projection and the fun-house horror of \\"The Further\\".  I actually would have been on board with the plot leap and the terrible pacing if the effects hadn't been so utterly absurd.      When Josh goes into \\"The Further\\" the movie quickly goes from a decent horror movie to a campy romp at the local fair's house of horrors.  Even low-budget movies should have better costume design than this, I've seen scarier Halloween costumes than anything that was presented in \\"The Further\\"!  I'm usually kind of a chicken when it comes to horror movies, but the second half of this movie was just so ridiculous I was too distracted to be scared.  Everything about this movie was kind of reminiscent of a really bad, really cheesy B horror movie from the 1950s, to the point where I started to think that maybe that was what the filmmakers were going for.    Other things I didn't like were the plot twist (very predictable from fairly early on) and the film's music score.  The music didn't really add suspense at all, it was just jarring and kind of kept me from getting too scared.  Overall, I'd say the preview for this movie was much better than the movie itself and I don't understand why its been so well-received.
B00475AUWW|4.0|Although this book is primarily aimed at writers, the advice is applicable to almost any area of a persons life. If you have ever been plagued with self-doubt, had your projects destroyed by self-sabotaging behavior or procrastination, this book will tell you why. And how to beat it. There are no \\"5 Keys to motivation\\" or bullet points here. This is not \\"rah-rah\\" motivational psycho-babble. This is not rehashed advice from the slew of self-help/ get rich authors that seem to dominate this niche. I'm sure the author never even needed to spend much effort marketing this book. It will market itself. If you are serious about destroying the barriers to your creativity, get a copy of this book.
030746363X|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book and found it entertaining.  I am 67 years old, a nutritionist, and I was very skeptical about the diet, but decided to give it a try.  Wow!  I have lost 10 lbs. in 4 weeks.  Would have lost more, but snuck fruit and some chocolate in and once had 2 \\"cheat\\" days in a row.  I prefer a vegetarian diet, but eat some meat, so it has been hard to get in substitutes.  I use seitan products, quinoa and amaranth (plant products that are complete proteins) as well as soy, chicken, and a bit of beef.  But I am losing after being at a plateau for more than a year.  I am glad to be spending less time at the gym while still gaining muscle mass and losing fat. Cravings for sugar are down and I feel great.  Interested to see what happens after several months.  I only have 10 more pounds to goal.  Just wondering how to maintain rather than lose when I get there.   I got the Kindle edition, by the way.  Cheaper, but a bit harder to maneuver around the chapters and view the charts.
B0055FR5PS|1.0|Yup, we're all about war now. As you watch this film, notice the subliminal messages couched in this military recruitment propaganda film:<br /><br />1.

B004VFYO52|5.0|Briefly, from start to finish a well-done release! It's nice & loud/a now classic late 90's live show from the Donnington Festival! Whitesnake's concert here was great all around! Excellent track listing and I especially enjoyed hearing Slip of The Tongue as the killer intro.! Attention Whitesnake legacy fans, go get this live audio 2cd set or the one w./DVD if you are not to concerned about the mediocre footage and sound! Take care!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this booked.  I started it around 11pm, and finished at 6am without a single break.  The plot, the charaters, the co-dependant relationship are simply amazing and thought provoking.  While I feel like I could relate to Abby at times, and America, it was Travis' intense longing and Abby's absolute denial of their attraction, that kept me turning the pages to see when they would finally connect.  Its a story line that still sticks in my mind, and I will definately read it again!
B003V6L94Q|4.0|Lets just start by saying that I wouldn't put pen to paper if I thought these guys weren't up to it. They've been around a while now and it tells.  My intro to this band was by way of a one-song set on the Ellen show ( I'm from New Zealand ) - that was good enough for me to review their other songs via Amazon and on the strength of that, I ordered two of their CD's, You Get what you Give and The Foundation.   I believe first impressions count when listening to a new music CD and for most part this music doesn't disappoint. If you want to produce and sell music,You have to build a CD that appeals to a cross section of your intended audience - the Zac Brown Band have managed to do that quite nicely.  Having said the above - why not get yourselves a distributor \\"down under\\" and  start distributing your music in Australia and New Zealand - both countries have a fairly large and growing appetite for what I would call \\"modern country music\\"(if I have to pigeonhole you at all) and I believe your music would sit very well with the folks down here.
1401223176|5.0|This is the best Batman story, I've ever read, better than Year One, the Man Who Laughs, etc.  Loeb tells a brilliantly story involving Batman's rogue's gallery from Joker to Ra's Al Ghul with an appearance by the man of steel himself as well. None of the involvement of the characters feel forced with a specific reason for each villian.  Catwoman plays a central role in this arc, developing the relationship between her and Batman.  Jim Lee does an amazing job with the artwork and this is one of the most impressively drawn Batman novels.  This is a must buy for everyone, from hardcore fans to casual readers.
0061205699|5.0|For whatever reason, I did not have the privilege of reading this book in school.However, I made it something to accomplish as part of my bucket list and am so glad I did. What a great book. I felt as if I could have been right with Scout and Jem. It brought a childlike perspective and yet, shed light on a serious social injustice and unfortunate part of American history.
1594484775|1.0|This book showed up with 30 pages missing - skips from 344 to 377.  You'd think amazon would have some sort of QA process in place!  So bizarre.  Good book up until pg 344, wish I knew what happened in those 30 pages.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Really this Compact Disc of 19 of her collaborations range from Don Johnson to Frank Sinatra as well as others like Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Ray Charles, Donna Summer, Barry Gibb, Harold Arlen and yes Judy Garland.     If you are a Barbra Streisand fan, this compact disc is a must have. The music compiled here have legendary performers singing songs with the legendary Barbra herself. There is one track which is really two tracks sung only by Barbra.     The compact disc has 19 songs which is pretty heavy amount of songs on one compact disc. While Barbra and her duet partners are included, this really is a tribute to a woman who can sing and never outsing them.     For the price here and the bargain bin at the local supermarket where I purchased mine, this compact disc is a pleasure to listen on the ride.
0316069884|4.0|This is among one of my favorite books in defense of making conscious food choices. Having been born and raised into a vegetarian family, I initially embraced vegetarianism out of necessity and later out of habit.  As such, I've never really wanted to make a statement about vegetarianism or make it seem like I was upholding some greater ideal because I've always known that many of the more complex emotional aspects of 'giving up meat' or 'going vegetarian' were not my reality. Instead, I've fielded the various questions about my dietary habits by referencing my family history and 'inherited' food culture.  In later years, I've come to understand and experience the environmental, societal and health benefits of being vegetarian, and I am deeply appreciative of this priceless legacy that my parents have left me.    As my husband and I consider having children ourselves, I wonder whether food choice will be as simple for our future kids as it was for me, and I question whether they will accept our family food choices as their own. What I like about this book is that Foer intricately weaves a story about his own challenges with food choice as well as the catalyst that the birth of his first child had on the approach he and his wife have now taken in raising their kids. While no person or book can provide 'the answer' to these life questions, I appreciated the way Foer writes about the topic in a more comprehensive and personal way than I've seen from other authors. I recommend it to anyone looking to broaden his or her perspective on food and food choice.

0439023513|3.0|After spending all day reading Mockingjay I am finally finished. I think I need some more time to process what I just read but I thought I'd offer my initial reaction, for what it's worth. Let me preface this by saying that anything I say about the novel is going to be a spoiler. So, I am going to try to write a review without any spoilers, which is quite a task. The thing that I can't seem to get out of my mind is the shift in tone at Chapter 25. The whole novel just takes a shift and it felt very bizarre, unnatural and unexpected. With only fifty pages left in the novel I got the impression that Collins felt she needed to hurry up and wrap things up. I've said this before and I'll say it again, I am not a fan of epilogues. I find them unnecessary and offensive, because the author is assuming the reader has no imagination. When, I reached the end I groaned to see that, yes an epilogue was included.   Getting past the parts I didn't care for I could never hate Mockingjay. Collins made me so emotionally attached to Katniss that any ending of the series would have pleased me. I think the book was well written and examined human relationships, which is when the series is at it's finest. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to spend a summer day.

0439023491|5.0|** spoiler alert ** I was weary of reading this when I finished The Hunger Games. I thought The Hunger Games was so well written and I thought it would be impossible to follow. When I read the first novel I thought the best part of the book was the actual games and I was concerned that without the games the second novel would fall apart. Suzanne Collins surprised me though when she decided to include a second hunger games. This all star version of the game was even more heart wrenching because the people competing were never supposed to have to do this again. Every participant is connected and it makes the games that more difficult. As a reader I became uncomfortable while reading because I was so emotionally invested in these characters. Collins managed to create an outstanding second novel that made Katniss even more likeable. I would definitely recommend this sequel.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|To be perfectly honest I didn't expect to like TRON: Legacy, but as I sat watching it unfold before my eyes, I realized that something was happening that rarely happens to me.  I was seeing something I had never seen before.  The world of TRON: Legacy, although it resembles vaguely the world of the first film, is a much darker, moodier, and more beautiful world.  The story is familiar, but I found myself totally immersed in it, watching with delight the entirely original realm of the digital world.  In short: I loved TRON: Legacy.     The film begins in 1989, about seven years after the end of the first film with a digitally de-aged Jeff Bridges reprising his role as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer and now head of a giant computer company called Encom, telling his son Sam about his adventures in the digital world and how he invented the video game \\"TRON\\".  Sam listens in amazement to what his dad has to say, and Flynn even promises to take him to the \\"Grid\\" one day.  Then suddenly, Kevin disappears, leaving his son an orphan and his company in ruins.  Twenty-one years later, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) finds the portal to the digital world his father created, to find not only his father, but also the system in ruins.  All of this takes about twenty minutes of screen time, which seems to me, in light of the subject matter, to be a bit of a long intro.  This film takes itself a little more seriously than the original, and as a result, can get away with a lot more generic story plots.  But the faults in the screenplay are hardly noticeable since we are so immersed in the visuals.  Seriously, this is one good lookin' film.  It is dark and atmospheric, and the CGI is used not just to dazzle us, but really as a kind of story devise, something rare in modern Hollywood films.  To all of the fans of the original TRON, take heart, because all of the iconic images from that film have been either transferred over to or improved upon in this one.  One of the best action scenes in the movie is a light-cycle battle much like the chase scene from film one, but instead of taking place on just one, two-dimensional coordinate plane, it now takes place on a multi-leveled grid which allows for some of the most fascinating and exciting shots of this past year.    Honestly, it's one of the best visual production designs in recent years.  The picture is so dark and cold looking, it's tranquil and peaceful and quiet despite the war going on around.  Where the first movie looked bizarre, electric, and colorful, this movie is the exact opposite.  As I said earlier, I've never seen anything like it.  I'll forgive the plot inaccuracies and contrivances just because of the visual style of the film.  It's really quite stunning, like something you might dream of.  Not anything like the first film.  There's something to be said for pure wonder and spectacle in a film, and I was bedazzled by TRON: Legacy.    I think my only serious problem with TRON: Legacy was its length.  At two hours and five minutes, it seemed way too long for this kind of film.  I think cutting about a half of an hour would have made it a much more acceptable running time.  By the time the credits rolled, despite my involvement in the motion picture, I found myself jumping out of my seat to get going.  It's way too long, a rather big problem in an otherwise wonderful film.  It's no masterpiece, but it's a whole heck of a lot better than TRON and for that matter, better than most of the recently released Disney sequels.  I hope that other such visually striking films will be married to a better screenplay, and then we'd have a rare sci-fi masterpiece.  I was suspicious of the ending, which seemed to leave room for TRON 3, a film I would greatly discourage.  A concept like that of the TRON films is a complex and interesting one that could probably be open to a lot of real philosophical debate.  If perhaps the film had been a little more understandable, and a little more thought provoking, it would have gone beyond a good sci-fi picture and could have been, well, great.         -Cole Webb Harter    read the full review at: [...]
159514188X|4.0|I started this book at 1 am Friday night and read until I couldn't keep my eyes open. As soon as I woke up Saturday I began reading it again and quickly finished. I was captivated by this book. The basic plot is this: Clay finds that he has been given seven cassette tapes that he must listen to. These tapes are narrated by Hannah, a girl he knows from school. When he's done with the tapes he has to pass them on to the next person on the list. I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that Hannah recently killed herself and on these tapes are the thirteen reasons why she did it. What happens next is a morality story about treating people nicely and being aware that even the smallest actions have consequences. I thought this book would become to preachy about loving your neighbor, being nice to everyone, blah blah blah. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was not. Jay Asher simply presents the readers with the facts and then lets them draw their own conclusions. I became emotionally invested in Hannah and hoped that in some surprise ending she didn't actually commit suicide.   This book is beautifully written with the view points of both Hannah and Clay alternating simultaneously. I read this over a week ago and I still can't get Hannah out of my head
B004VFYPTW|5.0|This is easily the best version of Whitesnake's historic performance at Donnington in 1990.  Fans of Whitesnake  should buy the CD/DVD combo - you won't be disappointed.  The video was taken from Coverdale's personal collection, and though the video quality won't win any awards (it wasn't shot in high def) it's the best quality I've ever seen for this show and the audio is top notch.  A great picture of a band at the height of their creativity.
0316067938|2.0|** spoiler alert ** Okay, I admit it it. I was a twihard. I read the first three books and then eagerly anticipated the release of the final installment of the series. I went to the bookstore at eleven p.m. on release night and waited it out for an hour with throngs of teenage girls. After I went home and recovered from all the squealing I began to read the series. Unfortunately, I was instantly disappointed. The beauty of the series was the build up of sexual tension between Bella, Jacob and Edward. (Not all three at the same time, although that might be interesting). There was some action in the first three books but for me the central conflict was always, who will she choose? The fourth book completely took this element out and left the final book feeling vacant and like a shell of it's more compassionate predecessors.   When Bella chooses Edward and they are married I felt like it all happened to quickly. What happened to Bella's confusion over Jacob? Breaking Dawn starts like a horse race and never lets up. Bella and Edward are married. Then she gets pregnant? How is this even possible? Edward is dead, shouldn't all of his sperm have followed suit and died when he became a member of the no pulse club? Okay, okay even if I believe that a vampire can impregnate a human (and on the first try too!) is it really necessary for Bella and Edward to have a child? Can't they be married awhile? Experience the slump after the honeymoon period? She can get fat and they can fight over the remote? Apparently not. As soon as little Renesmee (I'll just let that one go) is born Bella has to quickly be turned into a vampire because she would be unable to survive the half vampire child's birth if she were human. Right. Perhaps, they should have thought about poor delicate Bella pushing out a vampire child before they had sex. I'm just saying. Since, they were both going to be vampires anyway then this whole mess could have been avoided. But no, because then we wouldn't have a plot. The rest of the plot is fuzzy to me. Dainty Bella becomes dainty vampire Bella and Jacob uses Renesmee as the rebound girl after her mom broke his heart. Well to be fair, Renesmee is a newborn and will not techinically become the rebound girl until she is old enough to give consent. But, he imprinted on her so her consent is not really important. (Don't even get me started on that. The lack of a feminist hero in this series is incredibly sad).   I feel like Stephenie Meyer felt the pressure of quickly writing the final novel to her series, which had become wildly popular overnight. Unfortunately I think she dropped the ball. The problem with writing a novel quickly is that the character development that was so crucial to the other three books is lost. I loved the first three books but I could not get into this last one.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The best because of the atmosphere which surronds the characters in the film.  Very well put together and very convincing.Why would you try and copy this great movie?
1416955070|3.0|I'm not entirely sure what to say about City of Bones. The plot is not exactly what one would call original and I found myself being taken out of the novel because of the familiarity. There were some points where exact lines were word for word plucked from something else. Now I'm not saying she plagiarized it's just the phrases she chose to use are so common it felt at times like I had already read this. Not just the phrases are familiar either. I read somewhere that Cassandra Clare was a popular Harry Potter fan fiction writer before hitting it \\"big\\" with her Mortal Instruments Series and that made sense. The villain reminded me of Lord Voldemort so much so that when I was reading his dialogue I could hear Ralph Fiennes saying it in his creepy Voldemort voice. I don't blame Clare for using Voldemort as the basis for her villain, Valentine, because I too am a fan. However, I felt like I already read this novel. There are also bits of Twilight and Star Wars that seem to seep into the narrative.   Despite my general dislike of the novel and my ability to get every \\"secret\\" or plot point way before the protagonist I didn't hate City of Bones. I know I should, the creepy ending alone is enough to make me throw my book at the wall, but I can't. The actual demon hunting and slaying is fun and the sheer amount of mystical creatures was enough for me to keep reading. (Well that and the creepy \\"plot twist\\" at the end. I kept thinking, Oh Gross! This can't be true. But alas...) Clare created a beautiful landscape and filled it with potentially interesting characters. Having just finished this a few hours ago I'm still unsure whether or not I would recommend it to someone. It's a fun summer read but also a bit derivative of other, better works. I must admit that I do plan to read the next book in the trilogy out of pure curiosity. Hopefully, it succeeds my expectation
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|its something that every band for the last 5 yrs to re-release their old albums with few extra tracks or to re-visit an old fans fav album live bot megadeth had done and they succeeded in doing that . this time they have released a deluxe edition with a killer extra cd of live material not like what judas priest done a live dvd thats been recorded 20 yrs later , dave by releasing an old gig done the best job . iv been a fan since 1990 a die hard fan and iv been collecting everything and this is the best edition ever i hope dave next will release the same edition for RIP \m/ long live megadeth \m/
0439023521|5.0|I love this book! All of my friends were reading it and I was apprehensive at first because it's a young adult series but I am so glad I disregarded my holier than thou attitude. The Hunger Games is a beautifully written novel about the struggles 16 year old Katniss faces. The book is great for sci-fi lovers and is definitely not just for young adults. Suzanne Collins presents a dystopian society that is both fascinating and heartbreaking.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|For the sake of perspective, I haven't read the Harry Potter books, and though I have seen all of the movies, I haven't seen any of them more than twice.  I feel like that qualifies me as a non-fan, so I can only judge the film as a general moviegoer.  Having said that, I thought it was an exhilarating couple of hours that provided an epic conclusion (overused phrase, but it fits) to the series.  It was a satisfying, action-packed ending with a few surprising twists and some incredible confrontations.  The climax was thrilling, and for me, the movie overall was more exciting and had a clearer plot structure than Deathly Hallows Part One.  It starts off fairly slowly for about the first half hour, establishing a dark tone that persists throughout the movie, and matches up well with the tone of Part One.  Then, once the plot begins to roll, the film rarely lets up, with intense battles and stunning special effects.  At times, especially the light-hearted moments, you get the feel of the first few movies, but it's basically a very dark, violent fantasy film that is quite different from the series' beginning.  While there will surely be some who are not fully satisfied with every detail of the adaptation, I think most general movie fans will be impressed with the Harry Potter finale.
0553801473|3.0|I really hate to say this but...<br /><br />I loved the first 4 books in this series. I grant you, some more than others but love them I did. So it  pains me to admit that I have no love for this installment. In fact, i am shocked to say I found it extremely tedious. There was so much journeying and very little arriving that it was like an interminable, one step forwards two steps back , talky travelogue. It seems GRRM may need a more assertive editor.<br />I knew that his book was going to feel more like book 4, volume 2 than a book 5 but I still found it disconcerting that ADWD went back over already travelled ground. I would have preferred that the two books had been split by time rather than POV but that's just me. At about the 70% mark  it did get somewhat more interesting..When Cersei's story was continued I became more engaged, but Briennes story development was kind a wtf moment for me. Did I misread that last time we saw her? No explanation , really?<br /><br />Tyrion, usually a POV I enjoy the most was one I found myself reading some pages and skimming many  others. My heart sank in disappointment a couple of times when I approached his chapters. What a yawn.<br /><br />I also thought that the sexually explicit scenes and vocabulary, while always on the crude side, veer further into the arena of the gratuitous and perverse n this book. Especially when it comes to describing women. It came across as relentlessly  demeaning. One scene in particular comes to mind: a certain wedding night. I understand that the behavior of the groom was in line with his character but the bride was supposed to be only 10 or 11 yrs old! A line was crossed there for me. GRRM just loves the C word doesn't he? It never bothered me previously. I barely noticed it before, but it irritated me at times with this one.<br /><br />So, sadly this was a disappointing read for me.

B004XQO90O|4.0|Not since Minority Report has there been a really good time suspension futuristic-like thriller that has really captivated me and held my attention.  I didn't expect that at all from Source Code, but it exceeded at just that.<br /><br />Jake plays a helicopter pilot named Colter who has been \\"killed\\" in combat and should be dead, but when his brain still shows signs of activity he's entered into a test program called Source Code.  It claims that when someone dies, their brain records the last eight minutes of their life.  The military created Source Code to insert someone else into that eight minute recording in disguise as the dead person in order to combat terrorists or learn more information about who committed the crime. Colter is being sent onto a passenger train bound for Chicago, disguised as a teacher who was on that train, in order to find out who planted a bomb on it. The bomber is claiming to blow up Chicago later that day, as the train has already exploded that morning and Colter is \\"going back in time\\" in sort of a role playing scenario to figure out who did it.<br /><br />The conflict here is that Colter doesn't know how all of this is possible.  He has no knowledge of his real life events or of the events that have already taken place with the train.  He thinks he's in some sort of training simulation.  As details are unveiled to both him and the viewer, the plot really gets going and both will begin to contemplate what is real and what is imaginary.  And Colter begins to wonder if his actions in Source Code can or cannot really affect what has already happened.<br /><br />It's deeper than just time travel and much more intense that just some military action thriller.  Jake does a good job in this one and his acting seemed very real and believable.  I didn't remember much about the movie when it was first being advertised, but it looked good enough to rent and I'm glad I did.  I was well pleased overall and definitely taken by surprise.  Great film!  You may even have to watch it a second time to catch all the details that really lay out the plot, but definitely be prepared to be entertained!tch it a second time to catch all the details that really lay out the plot, but definitely be prepared to be entertained!
1439102724|1.0|The title of the review says it all.  Too much proselytizing on homosexuality, but no depth of characters and plot.  Skimmed through all the courtroom drama, or lack thereof.  Too much blah, blah, blah.  The book is as boring as its title and its contents.  Should be called \\"Ennui.\\"  This from a Picoult fanatic.
B003ASLJRW|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my brother-in-law, a Clint Eastwood fan, and he loved it.  He recently got a 46\\"Samsung hi-def TV with bluray player and is astounded at the clarity of the picture.  Thanks to Amazon movies are easy to find and affordable.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I started watching \\"Burlesque\\" with high hopes and they were FAR exceeded! I've always liked Cher, most of the time have enjoyed Christina, and the movie sounded like a lot of fun.  It was!<br /><br />First of all, the music was grand.  I just finished watching and immediately got online to order the soundtrack. Only a couple of songs by Cher but \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\" tore my heart out - Cher at her very best. And Christina! Wow -what can I say. I've never heard her any better. I especially loved \\"Bound to You\\"; \\"Something's Got a Hold On Me\\"; \\"Tough Lover\\"; \\"Guy What Takes His Time\\"; and \\"Show Me How You Burlesque.\\" None of the songs are bad, though.<br /><br />There was a great cast of secondary actors.  Stanley Tucci outdid himself.  Cam Gigandet was a hot love interest for Christina's character, Ali.  Alan Cumming had a small part but I loved him.  Eric Dane and Peter Gallagher played what they play best - men that are not easy to like.  Small cameo by James Brolin - would have liked to see more of him.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It was bawdy, suggestive, funny, romantic and just full of great music.  I plan on getting it for my permanent library.
0894803123|5.0|Love using this book!! Not only is it extreamly informative, but it has great stories and is full of humor! It's fun just to read! Lots of Ben & Jerry recipes! We have made a few things already and they were great! So looking forward to making more!
B003Y5H51K|4.0|I liked \\"Sanctum.\\"  It would have been worth watching for me if just the outer scenes of the cave entrance were shown - WOW.  I am assuming they are CGI but they are still breathtaking.<br /><br />The movie was based VERY loosely on the true-life experiences of writer Andrew Wight.  The changes definitely spiced up the movie but I wish it had been based more on the real experiences.  It was a great caving and exploration movie but I think too much was made of saying it was inspired by true-life experiences.  Of course, Pannikin Plain Cave is nowhere as spectacular as the images shown for the movie.  Oh well.  Truth or art?<br /><br />I liked Richard Roxburgh as Frank, the Dad and head diver.  I liked Rhys Wakefield as Josh, the son.  Both did a great job.  The other actors were good also.  Not a lot of dialogue in the movie and actually not a huge plot.  Group goes in cave, gets stuck in cave, has mishaps and tries to get out of cave.  But the images were beautiful.  I liked the computer model tour of the cave system shown towards the beginning of the film.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone that likes diving, caves or adventure films.  One unfortunate - there was PLENTY of unneeded salty language thrown into the dialogue.  It felt like the language was dumped in just to up the rating to an \\"R.\\"
0783229372|2.0|The overrated George C. Scott heads a cast of wooden actors through a thin plot built around the famed zeppelin. A laborious and meaningless flight has the audience waiting for the historic climax that could otherwise be seen acurately at your local library.  Wait for a film with a thoughtful and proper leaning perspective on this unique airship.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|I just finished watching the movie \\"Burlesque\\" (which I loved) and immediately got online to order the soundtrack.

0307271862|1.0|The had hopes of liking this book having read Mankell's Depth's and thoroughly enjoying it.  I was hooked from the first two pages and unhooked after the first two hundred.  It wandered aimlessly from country to country, it was so political, it stunk from then on and never got better.  I will probably never read Mankell again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the first book in the series and you meet the main character Katniss Everdeen, who is somewhat of a no nonsense girl who is striving to take care of her family in the harsh world that the was once the United States. It is a dystopian novel so the government is corrupt and cruel, and the people are subjected to harsh living conditions and the whims of the Capital. I'll start with the style...it's a very quick paced book and after the first few chapters you'll be drawn in because the world is so different and no harsh detail is spared. It's separated into three sections which helps give you breathing time because things move at a steady pace in the first section, and they definitely pick up in the second section. Like I said before it's a harsh story and I was a little surprised at the violence, it wasn't overly gory or horror story violent but i you don't like stories where there are quick, blunt and sometimes heart wrenching deaths don't read it.The characters are easy to \\"feel\\" for, some will be extremely easy to hate and others you'll love from the moment you read about them. One example is Rue, she's not in the book for a long period of time but in the short amount of time you are subjected to her she finds a way into your heart. I personally can't wait for the second one, and I hope it's as gripping as this was.
0307716511|5.0|Lupton's stunning debut novel is not what you've come to expect from your average mystery.  Her story is a hybrid-part mystery and part personal narrative of what it means to truly know and love someone.      I was not able to put this book down and the last chapter is exquisite.  Lupton is a screenwriter and I'm sure this will make a fine film.
0385341679|4.0|I very much enjoyed spending time in Moning's world throughout this series. This final book tied up most of the loose ends nicely, in a mostly satisfying way. I look forward to reading any spinoff series she's planning.<br /><br />I think where Moning shines most is in her characterization and world-building. Each character had very distinct voice and I enjoyed the consistency from one book to the next. I loved Dublin (warts and all), and felt Moning was able to immerse me into the city (and other worlds) very realistically. I also love her gift of dialogue and banter - especially between Mac and Barrons. It made them so real to me.<br /><br />All that said, I think this series would have shined even more if it was written a little more tightly, maybe into three books instead of five. There seemed to be a lot of repetition. Mac seemed to think back to when she first came to Dublin and compare herself to her present life multiple times in each book. While I understand why she needed the reflection (and her changing is a major component of the storyline), I felt that it became redundant.<br /><br />Starting with the third book, Mac also seemed to start making the same mistakes over and over again (with her relationship with Barrons and with her trying to figure out who she really was and how to defeat the book, etc.), and spinning around in place instead of growing as fast as she should have. I think if the author would have cut out some of the \\"spinning\\", and let some of the questions be answered earlier, or just tightened up the story to a trilogy, it would have been stronger overall. That said, it was well worth the time I spent on it, and feel it deserves four stars (this final book, and the series overall).
B0034G4OVS|5.0|We rented this movie on a whim.  It sounded really good, but from unknown actors we didn't know what to expect.  I'll admit - this movie started out sloooow and my husband wanted to give up on it.  I convinced him to stick with it because they had to give you background info so you'd know why things happened later.  We were so happy we stuck through the first 20 minutes.  Once it ramped up it really ramped up.  It was intense!!  It wasn't the \\"gory, gross you out\\" kind of scary movie so many people think of as 'horror' movies.  It was genuinely intense; watching through my fingers over my eyes intense.  Upon researching the film we found that the ski lift parts was entirely filmed on the actual lift (no green screens here people - live action!) and those were real wolves.  Matter of fact, if you watch the actors' face at one point you'll find that he wasn't 'acting scared' he really was - hence the real wolves - because they were so close! I won't spoil the movie for you, but surmise it to say - I won't be on any ski lifts, EVER again, lol!
B00006DEF9|5.0|\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is one of the best movie musicals, as well as one of the best movies about the movies, ever made.  Set at the dawn of the talking picture era, the film concerns silent film stars, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), a tremendously popular romantic duo, who attempt the difficult (and for many, impossible) transition from silent pictures to the talkies.    The acting honors here go to Hagen, who gives one of the funniest performances in movie history, playing a leading lady with a voice like fingernails on a chalkboard.  As Lockwood's best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), says, she  is a triple threat:   \\"She can't act, she can't sing, she can't dance.\\"     Kelly was never better.  O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, as Lockwood's love interest give fine performances as well.  The entire cast, even down to the minor characters, is superb.    Directors Kelly and Stanley Donen work movie magic.  The songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown are perfectly integrated into a witty script by Adolph Green and Betty Comden.  There are numerous memorable musical numbers, the best being Kelly's rendition of the title song, sung as he dances down a rain-soaked Hollywood street.    This film is a must for any fan of musicals, or movies period!
0553801473|3.0|wow - had to skip entire chapters and nothing much happened in the book other than dragons growing larger. If GRRM is not careful the Dragons might die of old age and then he will have an other Kong to deal with.<br />S
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|This franchise did not deserve to have a sequel. There where so many other options, but no!  Pixar was just trying to make a quick buck on this movie.   When Cars 1 ended it all ended, nothing more to extend upon.  When the Incredibles ended, it ended on a cliffhanger.  And i believe that Monsters Inc. deserved a sequel.    So...    I believe that this movie is a waste of time and was made just to take the money of poor parents that have their children screaming, wanting every car from the terrible movie.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|It has been a long time since I have seen a horror movie produced so well with great acting. This one is a classic to be and after watching the rental I had to buy it.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|This CD simply blew me away from the start. It launches like a speeding bullet and seldom lets up. Even the token slow songs impact with force. Michael Romeo's guitar playing is as virtuostic as ever, Russell Allen's vocals are regal and hard hitting. The songs range from fast euro-metal syle burners to powered groves and riffs that would make Dimebag proud. Granted there are a couple of moments that are uncomfortably Pantera-esque..in fact maybe TOO Pantera-esque, not that that is a bad thing, but I just hope there isn't any litigation over it!<br /> This is what Dream Theater SHOULD be, yet they can't get out of their own way sometimes. Symphony X manages to pack all that same brilliance into a 6 minute song without the 'Look at me!' 15 minute musical excess. Since I've discovered Symphony X, I can't even listen to Dream Theater anymore (without repeated yawns). But I digress.<br /> Iconoclast should be a contender for Metal CD of the year...it's that good!
1451629184|3.0|Jaycee is a survivor and I wish her nothing but the best in life and I hope she makes a ton of money from this book.  The book was ok, but I often found myself skipping through pages that were redundant and even boring.  A survivor she is, a writer she isn't.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This historical fiction brings out a rainbow of emotions out of the reader. Hate, disgust, compassion, love, admiration... to name a few. The most interesting part of the book is that the episodes that bging out those feelings were the 'historic' part of the life of Frank Lloyd Wright. Whatever your take on Mamah and Frank, this book will make you question your life and convictions. It will also awaken curiosity for the life of this genious. The more you read after the book, the more you want to read. His life was full of grandiosity: his ideas, his emotions, his creations and even his burial. What a story!! How little had been published about Mamah and I find myself wishing there would be more and MORE about this woman, who in spite of my feelings for her choices, was spectacular during that time in history. As a feminist of her time, I think she failed but I think you need to read the book and decide for yourself.

0143038419|5.0|I loved this book!  I truly believe with all my heart that all women should read it.  Although her views on spiritualism and her personal choices on romance might differ from mine, it is the fact that she exposes her raw emotions concerning choices that makes this book a truly unforgettable gem.  Everybody goes thorugh 'something' in our lives and hearing the story of how this woman overcame HER issues and conquered HERSELF is truly inspiring.
032147404X|4.0|Very quick read, but after finishing it has made its way into my camera bag for quick reference.  Author is very forthright in recommending better tools to improve your photography (lenses, tripods, etc), but even if you're cheap like me, you'll find plenty of value in using his tips to maximize what you can accomplish with what you have already.  Excellent pick for somebody who can understand the theory of f/stops and apertures, but has problems in the practical application of them....
0553801473|2.0|1/3 of the way into the book I realized that the story was going nowhere, and Martin just keeps throwing one-dimensional characters into the mix to flesh out pages.  A MAJOR disappointment, I wouldn't bother buying it.
0062060554|2.0|This novel was one of the most repetitive I've read.  By the nature of the story line, it had to be to some extent - and that I understand.  But, seriously already!    I put this book down a number of times and then, after reading a few more glowing reviews, felt I was missing something and tried again.  I grew to dislike the protaganist (Christine) and wasn't all the crazy about the surrounding characters.  In some places, the writing was juvenile and stilted. The dialog was predictable. And repetitious.  I will admit, right toward the middle, it takes off.  But that burst of energy doesn't last too long and the end is almost laughable.  I don't often leave negative reviews, but I wanted to let other readers know this novel does not live up to its hype.  Another reader here described it as bad 'chick lit', and I have to agree.  Not at all what I was expecting.
B003L77GH4|5.0|This show is definitely not aimed at teenagers, as I am 26, and it's my favorite show. I am definitely a fan of the Twilight Saga, but I first read the books and thought they were incredible, then soon after I downloaded season 1, which I was instantly hooked. It starts off kind of slow with the first few episodes, but then really starts to pick up. Twilight and The Vampire Diaries are no comparison. TVD blows Twilight out of the water for several different reasons. TVD makes vampires seem a bit more realistic. Well, as much realistic as vampires can be. I also love the part that the werewolves and witches play in part with the show. The acting is much better and doesn't seem as fake. The lead female is LIKEABLE. I know a lot of people when watching Twilight say how much they can't stand Kristen Stewart and her acting. Everyone in the cast does a phenomenal acting job, and they only get better and better as the seasons progress. They are showing growth. There is something for everyone. There is the love triangle between Elena, Damon and Stephen. Then you have the drama surrounding all the different rivalries such as the vampires and wolves. I also think at times it can be quite humorous. Damon plays a big part in that, in my opinion. There has never been an episode where I can say \\"Yeah, I know what's going to happen next\\" and each episode just gets better and better. The real action is when Katherine appears in season two, and then the mystery surrounding The Originals and all that goes on with The Sacrifice to break The Sun and the Moon Curse. All the flashbacks from 1864 in Mystic Falls really sheds light on future events as well. I can't wait for Season 3 and I know it's going to blow both previous seasons out of the water.
0553801473|2.0|George R.R.Martin can write but at this point most readers are ready for a bit of resolution and progression, which doesn't take place in this volume. Danny still has not learned to control her dragons, still has not invaded. Tyrion still has not met Danny. Arya's still training. The people at the Wall still are not fighting the Others. It feels like too many stills as the plots crawl towards a resolution without achieving it.<br /><br />There is plenty of sailing and the trademark detail of Martin, but at this point it feels like a case of get on with it, dude.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|...I couldn't watch.           The realism...amazing!  The effects...outstanding!  The story line..intriguing.  The acting...strong.           The camera work... nauseating!!!!  Oy!          The camera shake was so continuously disorientating that I began feeling nauseous, and that feeling just got worse and worse as time went on.          What's frustrating is that I WANTED to watch the movie because it is so riveting, but my equilibrium simply wouldn't let me.
B002RI9ORI|2.0|This book had some good information and at times was quite amusing, but I had one major beef. Constantly throughout the books the author goes on about \\"humanities graduates\\", equating them with ignorant science-deniers who spread misinformation and endanger people's lives (i.e. by being journalists who 'resent' science and by not believing in immunisation. Really, he has researched every immunisation opponent and discovered they are all humanities graduates? Please show me the statistics, Dr Goldacre.) This is ridiculous and a massive generalisation that is just as much bad science as that which he is seeking to expose.<br /><br />He also seems to think that all of his readers are male, because says, \\"I recommend looking at your sperm [under a microscope]; it's quite a soulful moment.\\" (location 4347 of Kindle edition). Well I'm sorry but I don't have any sperm and yes, female humanities graduates can read books about science. But that doesn't fit in with his world view. These kind of tiresome things really interfered with my enjoyment of the book and drove me to write this review. The book would have been better if he had left out these stupid, unsubstantiated and prejudiced jibes.
030746363X|5.0|A very amusing and interesting book.  It's part diet book, part Ripley's Believe it or Not.  I'm trying a few things more out of curiosity than anything.  I did lose 4 lb on my first week of slow carb.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|I really enjoyed THE TOWN...The cast, the plot, the plot twists, the writing,   direction, editing....EVERYTHING!  Ben Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Jon Hamm, and an outstanding cast NAILED THIS!!  Ben Affleck also did an impressive job as the director of this film.  Everybody who I have shown this movie, whose into this kind of drama and action, loves it.  Lots of action, a strong plot progression & dialogue between the characters...just a winner.  I'll spare you all the whole premise and blow by blow details, because there are so many reviews  here that already do that...It just suffices to say that this is easily one of the best films  (in this genre) of 2010...and it shouldn't be slept on.   I can watch it over and over, and see something different that I missed before.   To me, that equates to a classic! (-:
0553801473|3.0|I started reading this series around 2003, when I happened upon it at a bookstore. After that, I've hopelessly become addicted to this series. Like butter, if you forgive my comparison, I churned through the first three books relatively slowly and did not finish the third book until around 2008~2009. However, by the third book, the story was growing at a relatively fast pace, and I was enthralled by the action in the storyline. Even the fourth book, A Feast of Crows, did I think action was at its height since my favorite characters, Brienne, Cersei, and even Jaime had the opportunity to develop. Because of that, I rated book four 4/5 stars a few years back, and would do so again, if I had the chance. Therefore, I was disappointed when I purchased this book to find out that it was rated 3/5 stars by the readers on Amazon. I figured it could not be as bad as they say....right? I purchased this book at a local bookstore and sat down to read and burned through the book in about 2 days.<br /><br />Here are the summaries of what I thought of certain portions of this book:<br />*a bit of spoilers (nothing major)*<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed with the development of the plot. In the Tyrion POV, the character crossed over the narrow sea in an attempt to present himself to Daenerys. I thought it was boring, really, because each Tyrion chapter was so repetitive that I actually fell asleep reading! Each chapter was pretty much how he complained about the ship rocking back and forth.....pointless, in my opinion.<br /><br />The Daenerys POV's were a bit more enthralling that those of Tyrion's, but were pretty much pointless. In the beginning, she was in Mirien, and in the end, she was still in Mirien (well technically she was OUTSIDE of Mirien in the end, but who really cares?)....To get the point across, the Daenerys plot had very little plot development and I would have like more more my money!<br /><br />Other characters like Bran, Jon, Cersei, Arya were actually funto read, and their plot lines had actual development. That is enough to say, I think, without giving too much spoilers.<br /><br />The minor characters like Quityn, Victarion, Davos, and Mellisandre were basically pointless. I think the only POV I payed any attention to was that of Davos'. The rest I fell asleep to....<br /><br />To sum it up, I thought this book could've been more, plot-wise, and I was quite disappointed with the amount of material I got for my money. That is not to say that I won't be buying the next book---not at all, I love this series! I just hoped that there could have been more in this book, but aside from that, I really want to see how the plot will develop from now on.
0553801473|2.0|Some alternative titles that came to mind after finishing the book:<br /><br />\\"A Lacking of Editors\\"<br />\\"A Cashing of Royalty Checks\\"<br />\\"A Fulfilling of Contractual Obligations\\"<br />\\"A Losing of Interest\\"<br />\\"A Yawning of Readers\\"<br />\\"A Stuffing With Padding\\"<br />\\"A Bloating of Subplots\\"<br />\\"A Skimming of Chapters\\"<br />\\"A Nothing is Happening\\"<br />\\"A Why Am I Reading This?\\"<br />\\"A Done With This Series\\"<br /><br />Who are these five thousand tedious new characters introduced over halfway through the series and why should I care about them?<br /><br />Why have all the ostensible main characters turned into boring whiny passive/reactive repetitive unconvincingly drawn shadows of their former selves?<br /><br />Why does the plot only advance three inches in over a thousand pages?<br /><br />The first three books are great, awe-inspiring classics.  Enormous, towering achievements.  I can't remember the last time I became that emotionally caught up in a series of novels.<br /><br />The fourth is decent.  A change of pace, yeah, but still lots of interesting stuff there.<br /><br />But this one... sorry, I have to get off at this stop.<br /><br />If the next two (three? four? five?) books do come out at some point, I'll skim summaries.  But I'm not wading through this murk again.<br /><br />I don't mean to be mean.  Martin's a once in a generation fantasy writer.  A man of staggering talent.  And I wish him the very best of luck in his future endeavours.  This story's just clearly - to me, anyway - gotten very, very far away from him, and I can't go on watching it getting driven into the ground like this.
0553801473|2.0|I'm new to the series. I came to it via the HBO show, devoured all the books back to back in the past 6 weeks, and loved them - even AFFC, which puts me in the minority in terms of ASOIAF readership. So it really pains me to say that I found this book to be an excruciating read.<br /><br />If storytelling is the art of poetically crafting the essentials, then this book has failed miserably; repetitive, indulgent, meandering, full of one dimensional side characters (everyone not from Westeros), poorly drawn environments (everywhere east of Westeros) and monotonously developing main characters. Not to mention a preponderance of coincidental events that would stretch the credulity of a 10 year old... even for a fantasy series.<br /><br />Logan Pearsall Smith said \\"What I like in a good author is not what he says, but what he whispers.\\" Well, GRRM says far too much in this book and hardly ever whispers. ADWD is at least 300 pages too long for the story it's telling, and yet, amazingly, it still manages to end in a way that leaves the reader frustrated rather than satisfied, starved rather than nourished. It's a case of too many words for too little plot development.<br />For dredging through page upon ponderous page of unnecessary and mind-numbing fluff you are rewarded with not a single resolution to the myriad of old, and some new, open threads in this series.<br /><br />Writing this book was hard work for GRRM, and it shows.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|Unsatisfying novel of the Holocaust within France, seen through the eyes of a 10 year old child and a 45 year American journalist. Too much of the novel revolves around the marital and other problems of the journalist. Sarah's voice disappears early in the book and her life is only described third hand and from the lazy writer's friend, \\"the secret diary or letter\\" that explains all.

B004EPYZPI|5.0|Excellent Movie!  I have not seen a movie this amazing in a very long time.  The plot was excellent and you never know what's going to happen next.  Both the client and the lawyer are very conniving and really know how to sell a story. It's an incredible movie to see!    I rarely rate any products anymore, but when they're as outstanding as this one it's important for others to know.  If you're searching for a good movie then this is the one.
B0057UVLQ0|5.0|This is an astounding album for a girl as young as Selena.  Awesome songs, and she is an incredible talent.  At least 5 songs on this album are worthy of TOP 10 status.  I don't think I've enjoyed an album this much since the 1980s.<br />Download this one - it's a keeper!  I vote for BANG BANG BANG as my favorite, closely followed by WHIPLASH, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT, MY DILEMMA, and LOVE YOU LIKE A LOVE SONG.  Listen closely to the lyrics of THAT'S MORE LIKE IT - it's a riot!  It sounds like a perfect theme song for most of the girls I've dated:)<br />I should also mention that Selena's prior two albums are also winners and you will enjoy them all if you enjoy any one, although in my opinion THIS is her finest effort to date.  I can't WAIT until album number four!  Her videos are also artistic masterpieces in their own right - this is a girl who has every facet of her career honed to perfection.  And parents: Selena is the PERFECT role model for your child.  Selena is NOT a Britney or a Lindsay. She IS a truly gifted and gracious artist who every young lady can proudly aspire to emulate.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/16/2011:<br />I had the great pleasure of seeing Selena perform live at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas last weekend.  She put her heart and soul into that as well.  Thanks, Selena, for always giving your fans everything they could ask for and MORE!  Please come back to Vegas SOON!  One show wasn't nearly enough for me.<br /><br />I should also mention - if you enjoy Selena's music, be sure to listen to Meaghan Martin as well.  She sounds very similar to Selena but unfortunately has only released a few songs.  And you can see Selena on WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE on the Disney Channel, which is a very funny and entertaining show, and be sure to see her movie MONTE CARLO - Selena was fabulous in that.

Never the less...this book left me with a feeling that I had met a fantastic bunch of guys doing what needs to be done for our country.  Hoorah!

I think of them and I am out of my mind if this were to have happened to them. I cant shake this story and I am so taken by this special girl and so happy she is living out all of her dreams. just amazing. thank you for writing your journey and I wish I could hug you and haved saved you from your nightmare.

0066620996|3.0|After hearing about it in the pop psychology book [[ASIN:0307459667 The Invisible Gorilla]], I decided to read something I had seen so much about a few years ago: Good to Great. While the author of Great felt as if they his team had achieved something great in their study--real replicable science--the assessment in Gorilla was that Jim Collins didn't use science at all. Collins took companies that were great and tried to find what the common denominator was, then contrasted them with similar companies that did not become great. Science would be take a random selection of companies, put half of them on the Good to Great recipe and the others the not-so-great recipe and see the results.<br /><br />Of course, that would be nearly impossible to do in the business world. No one would want to participate in a study in which they were the control group which would lead to failure supposedly. So, unfortunately, this isn't science.<br /><br />All you need to do for proof of that is to look at one of the Great companies he talks about: Fannie Mae. Really? Fannie Mae a great company? Somehow, I just can't put a government-sponsored-enterprise free from real competition which also invented some of the risky investment vehicles which caused the economic collapse of 2008 in the great category. Of course, its greatness could have evaporated in the short time from the revision of this book (2005) to the housing market implosion in which Fannie was such a horrific victim of its own corrupt financial devices that Collins praised (it required and still requires billions of taxpayer money to stave off catastrophic bankruptcy).<br /><br />Okay, so if you excuse the author and his team for blowing it on Fannie Mae and you can get past the cheesy `90s catchphrases like \\"level 5 leader\\" \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" and the most irritating, \\"wash your cottage cheese,\\" you will enjoy this book. I do like the idea of following your passion and looking at the facts. Then again, it may bother you that Collins makes one final point at the end of the book that makes absolutely no sense: it doesn't matter what core values your company has just as long as you have values and stick to it. That's what will make yours a great company says Collins. Well, I guess having the wrong kind of values worked for Fannie Mae . . . at least for a few years.int at the end of the book that makes absolutely no sense: it doesn't matter what core values your company has just as long as you have values and stick to it.

B004LWZW24|4.0|I rented this movie based on the positive reviews. The opening title with the high pitched scary music made me question my sanity in checking it out. I wasn't sure if they purposely going for over the top, old school scary opening or thought this was really good. Turns out, the movie was actually pretty good.    Start off with the typical horror movie plot... family moves into a new home, problems arise, and the family is now scared out of their minds. Voices on the baby monitor, books pushed off shelves, doors opening, etc. Then a child falls into a coma, not medically a coma according to the doctors, but he won't wake up. The movie itself goes for the old fashioned suspense scare while mixing it with a whole lot of creepiness. There are several corny moments but in the end I was left freaked out enough to give this a thumbs up!
B003K025TQ|4.0|It is a good disc. When I got it I was thinking about jazz. Instead, the disc is a combination of a variaty of styles. Rock, blues, jazz, improvisation.In any case, all musicians in the disc are A1!!!!
0062060554|2.0|I couldn't stop reading this novel.  I wanted to desperately..... for it felt I was on a treadmill that was endless.  I was strong and read the rushed conclusion.  Rent it, borrow it, steal it but save your money for therapy!  I know, it has wonderful reviews and I thought I had a winner but many of you will regret the experience.  My review is weak, so am I; I just finished reading the book.

B004N44SOI|4.0|Great follow up to The Heroin Diaries. 90% of this album is fantastic. I'm not a fan of \\"Oh My God\\" but the rest of the material the guys have put onto this album is well written and performed. I think reading the book will add to the experience of the CD, which is what Nikki would want anyway, but it should be enjoyable to anyone who liked their first album, too.

0553801473|2.0|I finished Dance Thursday and waited a few days before penning this review to give myself a few days.  Despite effusive praise from a handful of somewhat respected sources, reviews that set my expectations through the roof for a book that was supposedly as good as ASoS, Dance disappointments on multiple levels.  The writing is probably the worst in the series, with tedious, repetitive expositions on food and clothing.  There is very little sharp dialogue that's so present throughout the previous books, even Feast.  The book appears to be building toward a grand finale, and then abruptly ends on too many cliffhangers, some of which feel very artificially tacked onto the book.  Reviews stated how the narrative arc begins to centralize itself, and yet that simply isn't the case.  One of the main expectations for the book, which also served as GRRM's Meereenesse knot excuse for its long delays, fails to even occur, with only one out of the expected four characters or factions arriving at Dany's court, and that one gains a new PoV that is entirely unnecessary and quite dull.  If GRRM struggled so mightily to manage this one addition to Dany's court, and needed to add even more PoVs to write the rather uncomplicated events that occur with Dany, he's going to flop like a fish out of water at his keyboard as he tries to juggle the myriad assortment of PoVs he's saddled himself with for the next book.<br /><br />At this point, I expect GRRM will need nine books to finish this story.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005ONMJ Mozart - Don Giovanni / Furtwangler]]  A friend of mine told me about haw impressed she was when she saw Cesari Siepi playing Don Giovanni, when I saw that the same production was among the offers, I bought it even though I had two versions of the opera playing the main character by Roggerio Raimondi and Bryn Terfel.  I found this cast very good .I have been very lucky in the selections that I have made of this difficult opera because it required very good singers /actors and frequent scenery   changes.  Even though the production is from 1954 the quality of the film is pretty good as well as the sound.  I read in some reviews that the applause from the public was deleted when the DVD was made, I really like to hear when I see a live performance because I can have an idea about the reaction of the audience that is watching the show,but it is not a reason to don't give 5 stars to the DVD, for me the must important things in the quality of the production are the singers/actors, the direction, the sound of the music and all these aspects were great.  It was an outstanding show that it wasn't outdated for the time that it was produced.
B003ELOQCK|3.0|I am an avid U2 fan, having loved their tunes after falling in love with Mysterious Ways as an 8 or 9 year old back in 1991. My first album was Zooropa, and I was the only person in my circle-of-friends who actually liked (and still likes!) Pop. I lost touch of them after I couldn't score tix for the Elevation Tour, and found them after buying their Atomic Bomb album with a gift card given me as a Christmas gift from a former boss. I saw them on the Vertigo Tour in Atlanta with my best friend and his dad, about 10-feet from the b-side ramp. Edge playing his Until the End of the World solo and the band ending the night with Bad were my two main highlights.    Fast forward a few years, and to No Line On the Horizon. Personally, I think it is their best, most realised album since Achtung Baby (my personal favorite). So, when my mom called me to say that she scored 4 tix for us to see the opening North American show in Chicago---stating, \\"Who's the most kickass mom in the world!!!\\"---I was stoked beyond belief. And, rightfully so. In a word, the show was epic. Almost overwhelmingly so (they spontaneously ended the main set with Bad, for crying out loud!).    So here we are at this dvd, which is the closest I have to a memento from my Chicago show. Minus the absence of Bad, I think the Rose Bowl setlist is overall better.  (The band later adding Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me and swapping I Will Follow and New Years Day depending on the night is even better!).  On this dvd, the band performs with uncanny energy, and Bono's is more consistently strong throughout than on most of their recent dvds.     So, what are my two quibbles? The first has been voiced by many below: editing Breath out of its opening slot. It may not be the best opener, but the martial drums starting things off sent such intense shivers down my spine in Chicago that it is an utter shame that Get On Your Boots has been relegated as the opener. Second, the audience volume is turned WAYYYY too low formuch of this recording. At Chicago, the audience singing along was audible for the majority of the show, particularly for Still Haven't Found, Bad, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Pride and With Or Without You (the same can be said for Atlanta on the Vertigo Tour). Even when the audience is turned up, it sounds too weak. Compare the video of Breath on the bonus disc to the main dvd. Compare the audience in the ZOOTV dvd, particularly when Bono prowls the ramp during Until the End of the World.      Overall, this dvd is epic, and despite my beefs, I recommend it! 3.5 stars!

B003UESJH4|5.0|This is an excellent film that explores the ability to overcome adversity and the power of relationships in providing the support needed to overcome adversity. Colin Firth plays Prince Albert, the Duke of York, who later becomes George VI. Helena Bonham-Carter plays his wife Elizabeth. Early in the film we see that the loving relationship between Elizabeth and her husband, Bertie, as he is called by family members, is in stark contrast to the chilly formal relationship that Bertie has to his father King George V and his mother, Queen Mary. Michael Gambon plays King George V, a not unsympathetic figure, but certainly completely in the dark in understanding the stammer with which Bertie struggles. It is Elizabeth, Duchess of York, who pursues some efforts to help her husband it is she who makes the first contacts with Lionel Logue, an Australian, who came to London after World War I. Gradually a relationship is built between Lionel and Bertie on which the speech therapy can progress. But there is an underlying reason why this story is of such importance. England faced a great challenge with the growth of Nazi Germany and the future was uncertain. In addition, after the death of George V, Bertie's older brother Edward became king. King Edward VIII was not mentally strong or emotionally mature enough to serve as king and he abdicates the throne to marry an American woman who had been twice divorced. Guy Pearce is excellent as Edward VIII, a charming and sophisticated man with limited intelligence and strength of character.  Thus Bertie and Elizabeth are thrown into roles they never expected to inherit and Bertie, as George VI, must be the voice of authority and reassurance as England enters a tense and unsure time in relationship to Nazi Germany. This is the historic background on which the film is based, but the film actually spends the majority of time exploring the interactions between Bertie and Lionel as Lionel helps Bertie explore the emotional underpinnings of his stammer and develop the skills to overcome the disability. Elizabeth finds Lionel and begins to believe in his services but the relationship with Bertie has several starts and stops.  Lionel comes to understand that Bertie has the moral character and determination to lead England should a war arise with Germany and Bertie comes to judge Lionel by the services he offers and the devotion he has to Bertie rather than by his credentials. The room in which Bertie and Lionel work is certainly worth mentioning since it is a large room with skylights and about 20 layers of wallpaper scraps clinging to the walls forming a fascinating collage that serves as the background of much of the human interaction in the film.  Lionel is extremely protective of the process he undertakes with Bertie and even his wife, played by Jennifer Ehle, does not know the true identity of this client. All the actors were superb and Colin Firth is excellent as George VI but Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as Lionel. The film is excellent and its core message of teamwork and trusting relationships in overcoming adversity rings true.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I have watched this concert probably fifty times and made my friends watch it and even made my favorite radio DJ watch it. I have never seen a recorded concert with this much raw talent, energy and just plain greatness.  My hope is that the Chili Peppers will stay together now that they are all sober and go onto the greatness that they have in them.  This band could have easily been as great as U2 if they had stayed sober and I think they still have it in them to reach that kind of greatness.  Each one of these guys is the best in what they have to bring to the table.  I wish them all the best and I hope they will continue to give us the gift that only they can give us.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Others have given in-depth reviews, so I'll suffice to say that if clever dialogue, great characters, a dash of romance, and a really well written mystery is what you're after, this book is for you!
B004RE29PO|5.0|I love this movie but watching it in Blu-ray format gave me twice as many goosebumps. Seeing such sharper detail on each alien's anatomy, and the face huggers, made me jump a few times. A must for the Blu-ray collection!
B004WN96ME|5.0|I cant say enough about how much I enjoy this box set. I'm a hardcore Megadeth fan, have seen them in concert  about 30 times going back to the late 80's. I have always wanted them to remaster the original recording, because i'm  not a fan of re-mixing and re-recording albums. The sound quality is much better than the original. This album is great,  every song is raw power, displays technical musicianship and is easily one of the top 5 thrash metal albums ever.  Nobody was playing metal this fast \\"AND\\" this technical back then and that Megadeth lineup was loaded with talented, although troubled muscians. I really love the live CD and always wanted Megadeth to release live material from their early days.  Yes, the recording equipment back then wasnt what it is now, so this live recording is very raw, has the expected rough patches, but WOW, does it ever capture Megadeth as they were in those early days... Fierce, raw, powerful, driven and talented!  The artwork and 3D cover adds a excellent touch and I enjoyed the booklet, photo's flyers and ticket stub also.  Hearing Lars rave about this album and Mustaines funny take on that time was classic also. Its expensive, but treat yourself  to the box set, you wont be disapointed! \m/
0345529057|5.0|I bought these books after watching the first season of the HBO adaptation Game of Thrones, and I am thoroughly impressed with these books. They are absolutely fantastic. The television show actually pales in comparison to these amazing books. If you are a fan of the show, or a fan of any fantasy films or books, especially The Lord of the Rings, then I highly recommend reading this truly awesome book series.
B004UG7RQ0|2.0|I bought this product specifically to fit into the male ipod adapter in a Honda Ridgeline RTS and it unfortunately does not work.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|Not meaning very great offense to other reviewers, but those who give this film 1 and 2 stars and claim that there is little of Jane Austen in this film must be very ignorant. Amanda Root's performance is exactly what I would expect to see as Anne Elliot onscreen. People complain about her and Ciaran Hinds as being too old; I call BS. Wentworth in the novel is in his mid-thirties, I believe, when he and Anne are re-united; Anne is 27, which was considered old in that time period. The point is that the characters have matured, it's been almost 10 years since they fell in love, of course they're not young anymore. Persuasion is largely regarded as Austen's most mature novel (which is one reason it is my favorite Austen novel). If you want youthful fluff, there's Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, or Emma.     If you are a Jane Austen fan, and especially if you love Persuasion, you should definitely see this movie. I mean, for God's sake, I just watched it for the first time 3 hours ago and am now watching it again!

031261246X|3.0|Zero Day had some very cool, technical details on how computer attacks are conducted, strategies hackers would use to cause massive amounts of damage, and some insight into their culture, but everything and everyone is very one-dimensional.  The scenes, situations, and characters are almost predictable, and ultimately almost boring.  The bad guys are really bad, the unsuspecting, under-prepared, reluctant heroes man-up just in time and are saved by just the right confluence of events and always end up in just the right point on the planet to save it.    We all suspend our disbelief some when we read thrillers and mysteries. My disbelief had to go into extended hibernation for the entire novel and finally woke up with a big yawn
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I found this to be great for the cost. Fit well, holds 2 cups, snacks, cell phone and the zipper pocket for my keys is a great bonus. Easy to put on. Does not fold in half becasue of a wire that helps hold the shape but for the low price I can deal with it.
1400052173|5.0|As a scientist, I had put this story in the back of my mind and reading this brings it straight to the front. It's an historical account of groundbreaking science but also raises some very interesting ethical considerations about who owns and can profit from our body parts. Of course, it's also a considerate story about the woman who unknowingly gave us this important tool for research.

1400064287|5.0|This book was mind blowing. If you are interested in psychology, this would help you connect dots as to why we do certain things.    Not only does the author state in vivid detail why his concepts make sense, he provide attention grabbing examples, stats and studies to prove his point. After you have read the book, you can go back to study what tactics he used in writing this book. Essentially, it is one big case study.    This is the kind of book you would want to go back over and over. Each time you will gain a deeper understanding, or be exposed to new ways to tackle challenges in your life.
B004WKOCP8|3.0|Been a big Incubus fan for a long time, and I'm not going to complain about the lack of heavy music. On all the previous records, I've always enjoyed the ballads, because Brandon Boyd and Mike Ezinger are able to produce such lush melodies. Even the \\"earth to bella\\" on light grenades was a departure for Incubus, but a good one! The problem with this cd is not a lack of heavy songs (although good Lord, did these guys write \\"sick sad little world\\"?), it's a lack of GOOD songs. I had to wait until track 10 for any driving, emotional music. I'll concur with many of the other reviewers and say most of the songs are just uninteresting, and devoid of any climax.     If this is the type of music Incubus wants to write in the future, then that is fine with me. However, I just can't understand why such an explosive and imaginative guitarist like Mike Ezinger substitutes piano for guitar parts on half of this cd. Frankly, after a five year gap, I am just so surprised that this is the product that came from this dynamic band. If you want to write 11 acoustic or adult lite contemporary songs, go for it, but make quality music! Drive, Mexico, Aquatic Transmission, Earth to Bella, Paper shoes, all great slow tempo songs. What a huge disappointment after five long years.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered this PS3 controller at the beginning of the month. It was sold by Noram International Partners, but fulfilled by Amazon.com. I live in Canada, but had it shipped to my brother's place in the US and my mom brought it back for me on her recent visit.    Like other reviewers, my controller was defective out of the box. The PS button in the center of the controller was permanently depressed and the battery would not charge. I called Sony Playstation US and imagine my surprise when I provide the model number and find out that I have a HONG KONG controller. Sony US will not do anything for me, because it is an HK controller. If I want Sony to repair it, I need to send to contact Sony HK and send it there. I cannot return it because I already threw away the original package, plus it is not economic for me to return it to Amazon because by the time I mail it to my brother, who would have to mail it back to me, I could buy a new controller from a local retailer.    I am very upset that there was no mention on the webpage that I was purchasing an import product. Had I known, I would have not purchased this.  I question whether it is even a legitimate import product or whether it is a fake controller. In my opinion, if Amazon.com is going to take the responsibility of fulfilling a third party order, there should be some oversight to make sure customers get legitimate, working products.  I will no longer purchase any video game hardware from Amazon.com for this very reason.
1451629184|4.0|This is not a heavily edited masterpiece. It isn't even a usual memoir by any means. So one can't review based on whether the storytelling is \\"good\\" or not -- it isn't what the author meant to convey. You have to let the contents sit and be felt. Let's be honest, some parts of the book were boring and repetitive, but that's exactly how she felt her life in captivity to be, and how else could the depth of that be told?    This is a distressing book to read. The graphic contents and \\"shock\\" are early on and brief, but it is always in the back of your mind. The most distressing parts come later though, when time drags itself out, hope fades, and you realize her prison is not physical, but psychological.    I listened to the audio book version to hear it in the author's own voice. There were some parts where you could hear her voice breaking up, it was awful. But she also has a sense of humor and not just a few deep insights. This was an intelligent woman who spent a lot of time thinking about her life and life in general, and that is worthy of being heard.
0802798233|5.0|Perfect Chemistry was the first book I read by Simone Elkeles, and she just blew me away. I read this in one sitting... which meant staying up more than half the night. I can't remember the last time I've done that! The next day, I went back and re-read parts of it... wanting to just devour it again. This was like West Side Story and The Outsiders meets Pretty in Pink. The writing is amazing, and I was completely immersed in the story. The characters are believable and have so much depth. I never would have thought I could get emotionally attached to a \\"perfect\\" cheerleader and a gangbanger! Hmmm... all I can do is gush... so how about a list of things I LOVED about this book:<br /><br />I LOVED how the chapters alternate perspectives between Brittany and Alex, so that you could get entirely into their heads.<br />I LOVED that the story is about two kids from opposite sides of the tracks, with differences in wealth, race, and social circles.<br />I LOVED that Brittany could recognize her own façade.<br />I LOVED that Alex was a smarty pants.<br />I LOVED that Brittany was so dedicated to her sister<br />I really liked the friendship that developed between Brittany and Isabel, and how realistic it was...<br />I LOVED how Elkeles tied in so many life lessons into a beautiful love story (don't judge a person by how they appear on the outside, or where they are from).<br />Most of all, I LOVED the chemistry between Brittany and Alex!<br /><br />Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this book! I did find the ending to be a little too... tied up in a neat little bow... but I loved the characters so much that I just ate it up. In case you couldn't tell... I highly recommend this book! Be advised that this is aimed toward older teens as it deals with drugs, sex, and gang violence.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Thanks God America chose David Cook as an American Idol! David, your first CD was one of the best I had bought in a long time. After much anticipation and time, your new creation is above and beyond all my expectations, thank you! It was worth the wait. If I was 3 decades younger, I would have to be a major groupie! Love, Love it!

B0056369RO|5.0|If you loved their first album, you'll love their new album. Upbeat, fun music that'll keep you shuffling for days. I would definitely go with the deluxe edition, I think you get like five more songs, all of which are good, and its only $2 more. Its some great tunes and makes a half hour drive to work go by in about five minutes.
0525423273|5.0|I read this in less than 24 hours... I just didn't want to stop reading, and I was sad when it ended. Every character is well written - flawed and realistic. I felt like I knew them, that Anna's friends were my friends. Ugh, and St. Clair is completely swoon-worthy and now possibly my favorite male fictional character. What made this love story so sweet, is that it wasn't an instant romance. It was the gradual, real, relationship building good stuff.<br /><br />I have to say that I also loved that this book took place in Paris! I actually studied abroad right outside of Paris when I was in college and it was hands down one of the BEST experiences of my life. I could relate to Anna about how she learned her way around the city (except I didn't hesitate to get out and do things). Reading about the city and her experiences was like the cherry on top of the best sundae ever (I know, complete and utter CHEESE... but this book does that to me)!<br /><br />This made it onto my favorites book shelf. I know this is a book I'll be picking up again and again. Seriously, one of the best YA books I've read. I can not wait to read more from Stephanie Perkins.
B0054U53WG|5.0|In the late 90's a young Larry Page, enrolled at Stanford in Computer Science, needed a subject for his Phd dissertation. His was a razor sharp engineering mind, but he was in need of something big, something worthy of his geek brain. They say technology lies on the edge of complexity, and thus, in those days, the most complex thing was the Internet, just a few years from launching into the mainstream. The web was growing at an amazing rate, truly a worth challenge for Page. That Stanford project became Google (not Googol), and today, the web is sprawling more than it ever has, making a Search engine, on the face of it, worth more than it ever was. Amidst infinite complexity, Google's algorithm has incredible value precisely because the world, and the web, is incredibly complex.<br /><br />The story of Google turns out to be a nice little summary of the last 15 or so years of Computing, picking up right about the time our last gen Silicon Valley Royals (those being Steve Jobs and Bill Gates) buried the hatchet (that story, by the way, is depicted nicely in the great \\"Pirates of Silicon Valley\\" TV Movie by Noah Wyle and Anthony Michael Hall, respectively).<br /><br />So why read a book about Google anyway? Well the truth is, most people won't. Most people will find this stuff incredibly dry. Everyone wants a Google business card, but few of us actually want to actually work at Google and stay up for 14 hours discussing search algorithms, Gmail Spambots and Google Streetview. Engineers, however, love this stuff. The simple act of saying, \\"This is hard, it's never been done before, it's probably impossible\\" is the equivalent of telling Schwarzenegger in the late 70's that he couldn't pick up a huge boulder. He's going to pick that rock up or die trying.<br /><br />The other thing Engineers like is money. It turns out that if you go back to Apple in the 80's, Microsoft in the 90's, and Google in the 2000's (and now Facebook in the 2010's), Engineers go wherever the IPO tells them to go. And thus we find ourselves in an interesting position: Google has lost some of its smartest people, and Facebook is the coolest kid on the block. Despite all the bad press, Mark Zuckerberg (who famously had more Facebook plaintiffs than Friends) is the most popular kid on Google Plus (Google's Facebook wannabe).<br /><br />But before we get into that, let's take a step back and try to understand what really drives this company: Google was never about making money. In fact, the founders taunted the business guys, mostly because they weren't smart enough to be Engineers. To be an MBA with no Engineering experience at Google is to be, in a way, a second class citizen. And yet Google gets richer and richer, almost as if to say, \\"We can do this stuff without even trying. What do we need you for?\\"<br /><br />So how does Google make money? By saving the logs of everything everybody on the Internet searches for, they can track incredibly detailed patterns of behaviour (like the way our brains have muscle memory and habits). If Google understands what you want, maybe Google can anticipate what you're looking for. And thus, perhaps they could actually give you an ad that you didn't hate. This is the point. You're not supposed to hate Google Ads. You're supposed to like them. And for that, Advertisers pay big money. Ideally, it's a win-win. If an advertiser starts talking to you about something you want, they're not annoying; they're actually useful.<br /><br />Here's where it gets really interesting: you may have heard that Google's mission is to organize the world's information. As such, it's inextricably tied to the growth of the Web. And thus, Google will do anything that promotes Web usage. This is why almost all Google services are free.<br /><br />Who could argue with this great business model? You take something that people are looking for, and give it to them for free. They never pay anything (like TV commercials), and we get big businesses to foot the bill. But Google does have its critics, namely Privacy advocates. Google often responds to criticism by calling upon the Invisible hand of the market: \\"If we do something wrong, people will tell us, and they'll stop using our stuff, and thus, the product will fail.\\" It's the kind of undeniable and irrefutable logic that almost suggests the Governments step away from all consumer protection. There's just one problem: a similar defence could be used for Drug Dealers. After all, the addicts keep coming back, they obviously like the product right? (What's the emoticon for sarcasm again?)<br /><br />And what's Google's drug in this analogy? Free (as in Beer). By getting the users hooked on free, they can pull in the advertisers. And it turns out, as long as you have lots of white space (Google's most preferred design language. Ahem.) you can put ads there. And if you suggest Google is exploiting people, they will respond that they are merely anticipating what their users are looking for and suggesting solutions. We users should be so lucky.<br /><br />Don't think of Google as a Search Engine, or a business; think of Google as a Brain. And where is that brain? Strewn around the world in Google's top secret Data Centres of course, where it holds indexes of everything on the Web, with its own fibers engineered to bring you the fastest results it possibly can. Like a man made Cerebral cortex connected to the worlds most efficient and genetically perfect spinal cord. Zero Downtime, Unlimited Memory and Super-Speed.<br /><br />You see, human brains are great, but they have this little problem of wearing down and expiring every 80 or so years.<br /><br />So if you're going to build a mechianical brain that can live forever, first you have to teach it stuff (Indexing the world's Information), and you have to give it a great memory (aforementioned Data Centers). As the brain becomes more intelligent, soon you'll want it to learn to speak (Google Translate) and develop feelings and social skills, which brings us back to Google+, Google's \\"Facebook-killer\\".<br /><br />So Social turns out to be the next phase in building a brain. Ironically, such technology only helps Google anticipate the users' wants and needs, feeding them better ads. Your friends know you.. they know what you like.

B005AUWXZ0|2.0|I'm not even a kid, but I was looking forward to a follow up to this Pixar classic. From the beginning of the movie, it is a very different tone overall compared to what the first movie was about. In the first movie, it had a lot of great values, a lot of heart and soul all while being an entertaining ride. In this one, it's all about action and corny jokes, creating a very different tone compared to the last movie.    It starts off introducing a James Bond like atmosphere where the spy car, voiced by Michael Cain gets busted spying on a group of \\"bad-guys\\" and an action filled chase follows with thrills and explosions; then the plot of the film kicks in where a guy, or I should say, a car, invents some new fuel source and creates a race challenge where he invites all of the different styles of racing champions from around the world to compete in it, all while the spys and bad-guys are up to something behind the scenes.     This movie features Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), but more of the focus seems to be around Mator (Larry The Cable Guy) who returns as a bumbling goof and gets himself mixed up in some spy business.     I won't ruin the plot, so I will leave it at that, but I will guarantee you, you are not going to find someone who can honestly say this movie is better, as good, or comes close to being as good as the first one. Why? It's just so different to the first, it has no heart, no soul, no morel and just relies on a few sight gags rather then make you feel you just saw something special, instead you just feel like they crammed together any old thing for a quick buck.    Don't get me wrong, it's not a TERRIBLE movie, but I would recommend hiring or d/l it. to purchase a copy, I know I would feel ripped off that I just bought a 20 to 30 buck coffee coaster I will never have a use for after seeing it once.
0553801473|3.0|This review will contain mild spoilers. You've been warned.<br /><br />This book was considerably better than A Feast for Crows.  It had characters many were looking forward to (Jon, Dany, and Tyrion), but the story did not move nearly as much as I expected it to and hoped it work.  The east (Mereen) has not moved forward much.  Dany is not much closer to Westeros and is perhaps farther from that.  Tyrion did not make it to Dany and the journey with Penny seemed to be irrelevant and boring.  Much of the planning in Dorne seemed all for naught (which isn't a problem, but I feel the book would have been better without Quentyn in it at all).<br /><br />On the plus side, Arya's and Samwell's sections were interesting but too few and far between.<br /><br />This series will not be finished in seven books unless the last two take place at a breakneck pace.

B004Q84Z0S|5.0|Ariodante ranks with Juliuo Cesare, Alcina, and Tamerlano as one of the four greatest of Handel's  operatic output. My first introduction to this masterpiece was years ago on lp's with Janet Baker in the title role under Raymond Leppard and, as is the case with many recordings from one's past, this one still holds much special meaning for me and I treasure her in this role.<br /><br />Later, however, and lucky for Handel fans, a series of great(er) recordings have come along, not least of which have seen Lorraine Hunt-Lieberson and Anne Sophie von Otter tackle the work. This latter, under Minkowski, has long been my favorite recording as I am sure it has for many others.<br /><br />A few years back I happily discovered Alan Curtis and his great work with the operas of Handel and Vivaldi. My esteem for him and his efforts has steadily risen and I now consider him the greatest proponent of these two giants' operas, and I have come to look forward to each new recording from him.<br /><br />This Ariodante, with Joyce DiDonato in the title role, is simply stunning and seems to be completely balanced, with everything in the right place vocally and instrumentally. The sound here is just wonderful, and to my ears completely idiomatic to this composer and his time, with Il Complesso Barocco again delivering a fabulous performance. I would place Curtis' efforts firmly alongside Minkowski's for direction of this work.<br /><br />As much as I like the previous singers of the role, DiDonato clearly rises above them all. She has mastered Handel's idiomatic style completely and seems \\"born\\" into this role. Her vocal delivery here is so beautiful as to be clearly the best we have heard, and to my ear impeccable. Her coloring of each aria quite simply opens doors into Handelian interpretation. Simply put, she is unmatched by any of the previous singers. Her execution of Handel's text throughout is marvelous, every utterance just seems tempered and delivered to perfection, breathing greater life into this role than we have seen before. Her trills will knock you back in your seat and her \\"Dopo note\\" is stunning. The \\"Scherza infida\\" is shaded and delivered more darkly by her here and it is simply fantastic!<br /><br />Karen Gauvin as Genevra is quite commendable, able to wring out all our sympathy, and I doubt anyone would have any disappointment with her interpretation or abilities. Marie-Nicole Lemiux sweeps everyone before her in her dark portrail of Polinesso. She, also, just seems born for her role here. Lurcanio, sung here by Topi Lehtipuu, is totally commendable and certainly on par with, perhaps better, than previous singers on other recordings.<br /><br />All in all, this new Ariodante clearly is a first choice for anyone coming to this opera for the first time, and it is definitely a \\"Must-Have\\" for seasoned Handel fans. I would expect that later this year when the Awards Season arrives, this will be a clear winner for best Opera Recording of the Year!<br /><br />You're gonna love this recording!<br /><br />****And, better yet, look at the price! How can you resist that, Handel Fans?****n we have seen before. Her trills will knock you back in your seat and her \\"Dopo note\\" is stunning. The \\"Scherza infida\\" is shaded and delivered more darkly by her here and it is simply fantastic!

B004J4WN0I|5.0|I thought the book was very well written.  I have always enjoyed playing a druid in MMORPGs and to finally see one cast in a strong light in a book was great.  In addition, I am  of Irish descent and my ancestor's mythology is never covered very well in any writing, fiction or not.  The book was a page-turner, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has become my favorite gift to give to friends.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I have been a Priest fan for decades and when I heard about this concept album, I was skeptical but decided to go for it.  I'll be honest; when I first heard it, I was like \\"WTF?\\"  After hearing such songs like \\"Pestilence and Plague,\\" I was quite ready to shelve this thing and call it a day.  Then, while doing my Greek homework (yeah, I'm a dichotomy...listening to a heavy metal story sung by a gay man about an occultist mystic while doing Christian Seminary studies); the beauty of this work began to shine through.  It is a sad journey about a tormented man with visions of apocalyptic destruction, the loss of his family, and being ostracized by his community.  You can feel Nostradamus' questioning of God and his crazy life while trying to deal with his obvious issues...something of which so many of us can relate.<br /><br />The guitars range from biting-edge to melodious darkness and the song that I hated most; \\"Pestilence and Plague,\\" transitioned from my least favorite to the top four most played songs on this cd.  I never cared for opera, but Halfords ability to tell a story not only with lyrics, but with such operatic vocal inflection, is nothing less than amazing.  Also, the, song \\"Future of Mankind,\\" reflects so much vocal emotion that one must ask if this is Rob Helford's question instead of the title character--a masterpiece of singing.<br /><br />I have Judas Priest's \\"Angel of Retribution,\\" of which I am quite fond.  But after one listening of that work, I have to call it quits for a while (especially the last minute of Lochness--makes me want to pull what hair I have left out of my skull).  Nostradamus, on the other hand; is a flowing \\"metallurgy\\" of meaningful movements from sweet silent reflection to full-on rage!  I will enter the realm of blasphemy and say that Nostradamus ranks up there with Rush and Pink Floyd's ability to create lush stories designed for mind trips.  Great driving music and if you can try this alone on a road trip during a lightning storm, I promise you will be hooked.ise you will be hooked.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was hysterical.  And unexpectedly heartwarming.  I really loved the Minions - their trip to the local kids toy mega store to buy a replacement toy for one of the little kid main characters was a laugh out loud moment for me.  Also the extras rocked.  There's this one where one of the Minions has brought a banana for lunch and we find out fruit is an important and desirable part of a good diet in the world of super criminals, but that sharing is not and will be avoided at any cost.  And then even better: there is the short about the first day on the job for three new members of a crack team of bomb carriers with ego issues... Sheesh, laugh till my eyes watered and sides hurt moments.  As for the main feature itself, this was a fun movie.  I had put off seeing it cause I couldn't see how a master criminal with kids could really end up being funny or even enjoyable on any level, but you can guess early on that the bad guy (spoiler alert) is going to turn out to be a pretty good Dad, cause he knew each of the zillions of his genetically engineered Minons by first name.  He was too good of a boss to really make it as bad guy for long.  He was mostly great at getting to the head of long lines effectively and finding parking on any street - I'd love to master either of his methods for these things.  Not that he should have ended up my role model as he was after all, a super villian, but none the less, he had very many interesting and in the end redeeming, qualities. Very funny movie.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|An excellent way to travel our wonderful planet. This DVD is filled with knowledge and wonders that the average person would never experience. i.e. the depths of the sea where no light is ever present, the creatures of the sea floor that live and survive in dark cold waters.  Caverns of beauty with natural crystal lighting. These two examples merely scratch the surface of what awaits. I was amazed at the many wonders that I never knew exist on our beautiful Planet Earth, you will be too.  This DVD is worth every penny.
B0042MEQVG|1.0|This movie is so terrible that I'd like an apology from someone.  I admit I watched it out of pop culture curiosity and it is vile.  Kristen Stewart has only one facial expression (disoriented anxiety) and I liken it to Harrison Ford in 'Regarding Henry' -- after he is shot in the head.  Why is this person so irresistible?  I suppose this would be cleared up if I read the book but I cannot imagine willingly interacting with these characters again.  There was no chemistry between Stewart and either Edward or Jacob - and I believe Stewart is involved with Pattison in real life.  Perhaps they sleep in twin beds.  The only pleasure I derived was from the hilarity of the werewolf uniforms:  regardless of the temperature, here they come again, clad only in long shorts.  In short, it's awful and should only be seen if you have a crush on one of these actors but not if you have any interest in acting, plot or enjoying yourself.
0307595862|4.0|Pushed by a brief but glowing sentence of praise from Michael Connelly, possibly the best of American mystery/thrillwriters, I succumbed to the lure of \\"The Snowman\\", by Jo Nesbo.<br /><br />Since the untimely demise of Scandinavian author Stieg Larsson, who set his thriller/killer trilogy OUTSIDE the standard approach of the police procedural, publishing houses, taken unawares by the incredible acclaim and book sales generated by Larsson's \\"The Girl\\" (with the Dragon Tattoo, etc.) in the English translation, have rushed to bring other Scandinavian authors to the American scene, with varying amounts of acclaim.<br /><br />Jo Nesbo, living and setting his novels in Oslo, Norway, briefly worked in journalism, but is an accomplished musician.  Nesbo published his first crime novel, featuring Detective Harry Hole, in 1997, some 8 years before Larsson's first novel went to press.  That successful novel, \\"The Bat Man\\" won two national awards for best crime novel in Norway.  Thus far, this novel and the second in the Harry Hole series, \\"The Cockroaches\\" have not been translated into English.  \\"The Snowman\\" is actually the 6th book in the series, and Nesbo followed up with \\"The Leopard\\", published this year.  As the series has progressed, Nesbo has won more and more world wide acclaim for his characterization of the flawed detective, his use of the visual to introduce some especially gruesome crime stories to his readers, and his exciting use of twists and turns that make it difficult for readers to predict his outcomes.<br /><br />Hole's an alcoholic, and I feel that Nesbo succeeds, quite apart from his skill with a police procedural, in his description of Hole's point of view on his disease, and also from his relationship with Rakel, the love of his life, who, at the start of \\"The Snowman\\" has found happiness with another.<br /><br />Nesbo's novel is about the disappearance of a number of women, under suspicious circumstances.  They start as missing persons cases, and it takes some time for the cases to be linked together.  The villain has left a cryptic message for detective Harry Hole, and the taunting voice of this note allows Hole to begin linking cases together, even as the timing of the disappearances of these wives/mothers begins to escalate.<br /><br />I may not have enjoyed this novel as much as others, because I have not read Nesbo's prior Harry Hole novels.  I found it moving too slowly in the first half of the book, and found the use of the visual symbol of the snowman to be a little distracting, and not as macabre as the author intended.<br /><br />By the middle of the novel however, having been led down a couple of false roads, the investigation, the willingness of the authorities to accept almost any plausible perpetrator (to quell fear of serial killing, almost unknown in Scandinavia) and the complication of Harry's relationship with his new partner all combined to make this a compelling read that kept me guessing right up to the end.  And I did, sit up all night, to finish the last half.<br /><br />It left me wanting more, and I will probably go back to the prior books to see if Nesbo can draw me in.  Satisfying, ironic in that Nesbo keeps his thread tied into the American political scene by using our presidential elections as a backdrop, well-crafted although plodding in the first half, \\"The Snowman\\" is well worth your time.o be linked together.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|First off, this amp meets the lowest prerequisite for me to carry around-the liability is just too high, and I don't have money to throw out the window. If the power was any lower, it wouldn't be worth it to me to carry around. I use mp3 players on a daily basis, and I am always on the go. In my box I have a smashed nano, two Creative Zen V+'s, a Sylvania, a Sansa, an Emerson, and a Trekstor to name about half of them. I think as of now three of them work.<br /><br />I still haven't used it a lot so I am not quite used to it but for the size, it's not bad. It will hold me over until I build my cmoy.<br /><br />That said, this thing is FLIMSY! It is not built solidly, so if you are accident prone like me, be very careful. I built a metal cage out of parts laying around because I KNOW eventually something will happen to it. If you want to see the pictures of it, either look at my profile or look at the customer images for this product.
B000001ESP|5.0|This album is a classic from Rush.  It is their 8th studio album, released in 1981.  It is possibly their most popular and well known.  Due to this being the 80's, there is a bit more synth involved than on the early albums, but it is incorporated very well, in a bit of a timeless fashion.  It still has plenty of awesome guitar and bass work from Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart has really hit his stride with insanely awesome drumming.  The album starts off with the radio staple \\"Tom Sawyer\\" showing much more synth than on their earlier albums, which I would recommend getting if you are only buying a few songs off this album.  The third song on the album, \\"YYZ\\", is a pretty awesome instrumental, also another song I would recommend buying if not buying the whole album.  YYZ is the airport code for Toronto Pearson International Airport, and the Morse Code for YYZ is played at the beginning of the song, and also is worked into the main riff.  The rest of the songs are also pretty good and round out the album very well.  I would put this as the second best Rush album, behind 2112, but it might be a little more accessible to casual listeners.
B003L20ICE|1.0|Hated the way the film treats Paul - the children bring him into the family and ultimately the whole family uses him and then cruelly discards him in the end.  He was the only character that felt like a genuinely nice and real person.  The rest of the cast are more messed up than he is but the film forgives them and demonizes him.  Really a lame movie.
0393334988|4.0|'If I'd never been able to put a name to the face of of one of the men who had harmed me, and never discovered that behind that face there was also a damaged life, the nightmares would always have come from a past without meaning. And I had proved for myself that remembering is not enough, if it simply hardens hate. (last page).    A calmly-written story of astonishing suffering and scarring, taken to another level by the attempts of two old men to bridge their mutual wounds through forgiveness. Lovely, moving book.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|The self-proclaimed mother monster is back with her second (and a half) studio album where she takes on 80's power ballads and the retro dance genre. This 80's theme extends to the European techno vibe that took off during the same decade, note 'Scheibe'. Even the umlaut in 'You and I' (can't replicate here) is mega 80's a la Motley Crue and Queensryche. The old drum machines and synthesizers are all here, notably what sounds like a TR-808 cowbell and hand clap, possibly the same electronic percussion for the I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Whitney Houston) sound alike track: 'Fashion of His Love'. The synthesizers in particular act as a conduit, at times melding New Wave 80's with modern electronica. Born This Way commingles the sounds of a plethora of artists (Pat Benatar, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, MJ, and Journey) against a religious themed backdrop. In keeping with the themed album formula, The Fame espoused shallow virtues like vanity, notoriety, wealth, and power. The Fame's second incarnation, The Fame: Monster, was an appropriately darker, more brooding piece as evidenced by melancholic lyrics and dissonance. Born This Way exhibits the full fledged evolution of an artist, a markedly different sound compared to Lady Gaga's debut album which has split her current fan base. Love it or hate it, Lady Gaga has attempted to break new ground and made some pretty outrageous claims like promising this would be the best album of the decade and certainly the best of her career. Judging by Amazon alone, Born This Way has fueled either hard core loyalty or dissension, but an overinflated ego won't earn her any new fans.<br /><br />There's a lot to love here including the title track and if you haven't heard it or seen the video by now you clearly live under a rock. The video leaves much to be desired and I was expecting something very different. Lady G wrote the script and brought some outside influences to aid with art direction and styling so it's a tough call as far as what's her vision and what's studio manufactured. I'm willing to bet it's a bit of both, but the message of self-acceptance in the face of adversity is great and the song hits  high notes lyrically and melodically. The 'country road version' is also the only remix I've ever liked, let alone tolerated, so thanks again, Gaga! As for the other remixes on the album, they are mostly tailored for the dance/house/trance crowd, many of whom are Gaga fans so that makes sense despite the fact that I really didn't like them. Finally, I just don't get the Express Yourself comparison. I've heard both songs and they sound nothing alike, although Gaga does copy Madge's style (make-up, clothing, etc) and sings similarly. 'Fashion of His Love', on the other hand, while fantastic it really does sound exactly like I Wanna Dance With Somebody and I'm surprised that comparison hasn't been given nearly as much attention. 'Judas' is my favorite record on the album about being torn between two lovers, one a backstabbing betrayer aka Judas and the other a quintessential good guy archetype aka Jesus, while secretly seeking revenge. The video is as intriguing and evocative as the lyrics and both are replete with religious symbolism; a simply superb track. The late Clarence Clemons (RIP) of E-Street Band fame is featured on two stellar tracks 'Hair' (secretly hoped it would be a remake of the title Broadway musical hit) and 'The Edge of Glory'. Reportedly, Clemons spoke very highly of Gaga prior to his death and was honored to be a part of the project.<br /><br />Additional tracks include 'Bad Kids' which lifts lyrics directly from the intro of MJ's They Don't Really Care About Us: \\"We don't care what people say, we know the truth!\\". It should be noted that at the time Michael Jackson wrote that lyric he was dealing with some pretty dire legal troubles so the line itself rings rather hollow in an obnoxious tune about being a degenerate and thumbing your nose at anyone who takes offense.'You and I', however, is highly underrated and has some serious potential as a single. The ballad follows the same vein as Speechless with throaty vocals, piano, and a stomp-stomp-clap rhythm akin to Def Leppard/Queen. 'Marry the Night' is another solid track about living/loving the night life, basically unabashedly enjoying yourself accented by a pulse pounding, upbeat tempo with soaring vocals.<br /><br />However, no one is perfect, not even Lady Gaga (although she is trying to convince us otherwise). 'Americano' is basically Alejandro 2.0, so if you loved The Fame: Monster's incarnation you will love this as well and if you didn't then you and I are in the same boat. I had heard a lot of good things about 'Heavy Metal Lover', including infamous lyrics like \\"I want your whiskey mouth all over my blonde south\\" and \\"Dirty pony, I can't wait to hose you down\\". Really the song comes across as an amalgamation of sounds culminating in noise under the guise of 'experimental'; 'Scheibe' suffers this same fate I'm afraid. Both songs try way too hard to be 'different' and 'edgy', but just sound confused: vocal distortion, auto-tune, overwrought bass beats, dissonant synths and infantile lyrics...yuck. You could actually add 'Government Hooker' to this pig pile since those criticisms fit this track almost to a T. The intro is nice enough and features a glittery, almost operatic Gaga mezzo-soprano, but after several seconds the beat starts and, woof!, the magic dissipates as soon as it began. I was desperately searching for something subversive or at the very least introspective, but alas \\"Put your hands on me John F Kennedy/I'll make you squeal baby, as long as you pay me\\" is as close as she gets. It's astonishing that Lady Gaga can produce an album (mostly of her own design) that features such dichotomy. That's probably why I can only give this four out of five stars.<br /><br />This album was not a complete let down, but I will expect better in the future. Overall I enjoyed most of it and some of the bonus tracks were worth it (excluding the remixes). I'd recommend the album although so far her best work has been The Fame: Monster, in my opinion. Many out there (apparently on Amazon among other places) still regard Lady G as a passable annoyance, but her live performances set her apart form any other and I would direct doubters to YouTube which is where I learned to love this wunderkind misfit from NY. Beautiful vocals and a knack for writing great hooks and melodies, our mother monster isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In the words of Clarence Clemons, \\"She's the real deal. All the craziness and stuff, there's a purpose to all of it. She has no boundaries....\\", however, is highly underrated and has some serious potential as a single.

0061251321|5.0|How effective is your company in achieving its mission?  What role do you play in your teams?  How effective are you as a leader?  How can you improve your leadership beyond steering or controlling groups?<br /><br />No doubt we've asked these questions of ourselves.  We may have even come up with somewhat satisfactory answers.  However, there's nothing like research-based studies and books to shed light on what we may already intuit, or in helping us understand how to better lead our professional and personal lives.<br /><br />This last thought is exactly what may occur to you when reading the paper-back edition release of  Tribal Leadership by Dave Logan, John King, & Halee Fischer-Wright. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in better understanding how to lead teams, groups, or companies into a new level of productivity AND camaraderie.  Read on to learn why.<br /><br />Overall<br />The book is well-written and easy to follow.  In fact, you may start the book and become addicted to the ideas, unable to put it down.  The conclusions are based on a study of 24,000 people in different companies at different levels of efficacy.<br /><br />The description of each stage of leadership, from complete chaos (Stage 1, \\"Life sucks\\") to a well-oiled machine (Stage 5, \\"Life is great\\"), is lucid enough to seem familiar from your day-to-day life.  You'll likely come away from this book  with a new mindset to navigate your personal and professional life to better serve, not just yourself, but your community at-large.<br /><br />In short, after reading this book and applying its lessons, you'll become a better member of society and the world community, increasing your happiness as well as everyone else's.<br /><br />Pros<br />The authors' approach to leadership is based on a study of 24,000 people in different organizations. The focus is not purely on Drucker-style of leadership lessons, but historical evidence of effective leaders and the common theme that runs through each leader's story.<br /><br />This may sound like a typical theme for leadership books, except the authors approach and interpretation is different.  The authors focus on relationships and the languages that represent the different styles of leadership, not just ideas.  Given the book is based on studies of individuals and their results, the concepts aren't theoretical in nature.  In fact, the authors admit they had to revise their pre-conceived notions based on lessons learned in the course of preparing to write and update this book.<br /><br />The various levels of an organization and leadership are described as Stages, each signified by a general state of mind, consisting of a Mood and a Theme (table below is recreated from page 25 in the book):<br /><br />Stage 5: Innocent Wonderment, \\"Life is great\\"<br />Stage 4: Tribal Pride, \\"We're great(and they're not)\\"<br />Stage 3: Lone Warrior, \\"I'm great(and you're not)\\"<br />Stage 2: Apathetic Victim, \\"My life sucks\\"<br />Stage 1: Despairing Hostility, \\"Life sucks\\"<br /><br />The Themes are summaries of the language a person in each stage uses to express their state of mind.  Each of us have been at these Stages at one point or another in our lives, though, as the authors explain, the majority of population gets stuck at Stages 2 and 3.  Stage 3 is the most prevalent, as is apparent in our day-to-day interactions with overpowering managers, bosses, or business owners who portray the \\"I'm great, and you're not\\" mentality, with especial emphasis on \\"you're not.\\"<br /><br />The goal of the book is to provide each person and, in turn, the groups that they lead, the tools to elevate to Stages 4 and 5 as quickly as possible.  However, there are apparently no shortcuts. You need to own and graduate from each Stage.  The graduation comes when we have mastered a stage and realize there has to be a better way of operating than the current Stage.  Trying to bypass a Stage by purely using the language of a higher one comesacross as disingenuous.  We've all worked in companies where the leaders talk about how \\"we can be great if we do X,\\" but their actions demonstrate they mean \\"I can be better off if YOU do X.\\"  This approach doesn't just come across as lacking, but also leads to distrust of leadership and eventual downfall of an organization into the ineffective Stage 2 mentality.<br /><br />The stages are described as Viral.  To demonstrate this concept and how quickly Stage 2 groups can form, during a presentation to large groups, one of the authors often states aloud that, \\"My life sucks because I have to be here with all of you\\" (page 64).  After the audience gets over being stunned, one person may pipe up that their life sucks since they have to listen to the speaker.  Soon, everyone's chiming in why their life sucks as people become comfortable airing their daily life frustrations. This viral nature isn't limited to Stage 2, but can be replicated in all other stages as well, pointing to how language can be used to lead a group into a higher Stage of operation.  The caveat is that the members must be ready to graduate to a higher stage.<br /><br />The authors warn that the Stages shouldn't be used to categorize people, but to understand a person's or organization's language and relationships.  They argue that categorization leads to pigeon-holing which prevents a person's or organization's graduation to a higher Stage.<br /><br />The concepts in the book are sticky given the book's clear structure and presentation.  Each chapter starts out by introducing the main points in the initial pages, then delivers the ideas in detail, and, finally, summarizes the chapter with Leverage Points and Success Indicators.  The summaries are essentially a bulleted list of key points that could be actionable.<br /><br />Aside from the main content, the book contains three key Appendices.  You may be tempted to skip them, until you realize they provide the ideas in brief for each Stage of Tribal Leadership, the summary of the research that lead to the book, and details of how the authors can be reached.  The authors do truly practice what they preach: setting up relationships that benefit a group or the society at large.<br /><br />Cons<br />Some of the ideas in the book may seem academic, though nothing like theoretical models you'd see in textbooks.  In fact, the authors have skipped the \\"academics\\" by providing some of the theories and research details in Appendix B, thus allowing the reader to focus on the lessons learned in the main body of the book. In general, the ideas are approachable and will be comprehendible by most readers, from individual contributors to leaders.<br /><br />Also the tips on how to progress from one Stage to another could be more detailed.

B004V6MWFU|5.0|This is an awesome CD, although very different from what you'd expect from Eddie Vedder.  Romantic oriented and some songs are slow paced, but the music draws you in and his instrumentals are beautiful. Nice mellow music to wake up to or wind down with. Forget the crowd surfing here, but you can truly visualize him writing these songs in Hawaii. A must have for your Eddie Vedder collection.
0545123275|2.0|I'm an avid reader, but only just recently have I started reading some fiction that is classed as \\"young adult\\".  I read the Twilight series and just finished The Hunger Games series; both of which I really enjoyed.  Sometimes you just want a light, easy, exciting read.  Shiver was not that book.  It was in fact a light, easy read, but I did not enjoy it at all.  Many other people have reviewed what's wrong with it, so I won't go through all the excruciating details.  It just felt very one note to me and the plot was weak.  Enough said.  Not my cup of tea and I won't be reading any more of this series.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|\\"Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here.    The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry), Rupert Grint (as Ron) & Emma Watson (as Hermione) is excellent. The directing by David Yates is excellent. The screenplay (based on J.K. Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves is excellent.    The music by Alexandre Desplat is excellent. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra is excellent. The film editing by Mark Day is excellent. The casting by Fiona Weir is excellent. The production design by Stuart Craig is excellent. The art direction by Andrew Ackland-Snow, Alastair Bullock, Martin Foley, Christian Huband, Molly Hughes, Hattie Storey & Gary Tomkins is excellent. The set decoration by Stephenie McMillian is excellent. The costume design by Jany Temime is excellent. The make-up effects design by Nick Dudman is excellent. The visual effects are excellent.    This is a fitting and well-made conclusion to one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. It is also terrific and entertaining. This is the best movie of the summer and possibly, the best movie of the year.
0596522347|1.0|This book is unreadable!  There are too many contrasts in type size and color.  Odd that a book written on slide presentation has violated this basic priciple of readability.  I regret that I wasted my money on it.

And you don't have a guy in the seat next to you screaming \\"EDDIE!!\\"  Just got back from seeing him in Phil. PA. where he sang a lot of this material.  He has come a long way from croud surfing, but I like it all! He's doing so much more and keeps producing awesome music.  You got to get this!
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Got this as the app of the day, and based on our love of 'Plants vs Zombies' and the playful dinosaur icon thought it would be fun for my six year old. Turns out its way too graphic, so I just uninstalled it.  Also had problems on my Evo... it loads, then goes to an error page. You can back up and then the game is there, but I don't have the patience to deal with buggy software.  Can't really recommend this one.
B004LWZW24|1.0|So, the previews, prior to the film coming out, made it appear to be a nice, creepy, perhaps subtle haunted house story. Something with a ton of suspense...maybe not the most original plot and some really great actors. If only they'd decided to go ahead and make THAT movie...<br /><br />This was awful. Just awful. However, it started out really well. As per usual, we get the seemingly normal, attractive, happy family just going about their daily lives when...suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, bad things happen. Suspense starts to build when they begin hearing strange sounds, seeing strange things...it's all very creepy and simple at this point in the movie. Very effective.<br /><br />Then we enter the second half. When things REALLY started going downhill. The explanation for what was going on was interesting enough, not very original, maybe a bit silly but, interesting nonetheless. The first time I saw the \\"demon\\", I was shocked. Really shocked. Mostly because of how idiotic it looked. Then I started thinking wow, they actually put THAT in a movie. I brushed it off and said to myself that it had been great so far...maybe we won't see it again. But we do...time and time again. Along with other ridiculous looking creatures and people or...whatever you want to call them. The entire thing was just absurd.<br /><br />In the second half, I felt like I'd started watching a different movie. The entire tone changed, the pacing changed, the look and feel of the movie changed. It turned into completely cheesy trash. The sets were horrible, the costumes, the makeup, the effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. The guys who did Saw (only the first 2 Saw movies are watchable) and Dead Silence (terrible, terrible movie) have NO idea what \\"creepy\\" or \\"scary\\" looks like. Not to mention I feel like they keep copying themselves. The \\"twist\\" they always stick in there right at the end...ridiculous! It makes me mad at just how ridiculous...I just sat there shaking my head when I wasn't laughing. Someone obviously took a trip to a costume store and stocked up on as much discount makeup, bad masks and bad wigs as they could find. Cheap, cheap, cheap! It all just felt so lazy.<br /><br />Overall, what we have is something that could have been a really great movie but it was directed and designed by guys who have really bad taste and absolutely NO clue as to what \\"scary\\" is. A complete and total disappointment. I can't help but feel like James Wan is somewhere counting his money and laughing at everyone that wasted our time watching this mess.<br /><br />Avoid it. Unless you think old women in gas masks and a Tiny Tim obsessed Darth Maul haunting a house has some entertainment value somehow.ne obviously took a trip to a costume store and stocked up on as much discount makeup, bad masks and bad wigs as they could find.

1451629184|5.0|Coming from a horribly abusive home that stretched on for too many years I can say this book really hit home for me.  It struck a cord deep within me.  It makes me really sad to know that I can identify with this story because it reveals to me just how sick the environment I grew up in was.  Regardless of what type of home you have grown up in, this books is important to read.  I think it is vitally important to all of us to read about the many variations of the human experience we all live.  I hope Jaycee and her girls are able to move past this and live happy lives just as I wish the same for me and my sisters.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was a great series that documents how war takes its toll on us not only physically but psychologically and how families dealt with seeing their sons sent off to war. Great series and I strongly recommend it to everyone.
B00003CXBK|3.0|The movie was as good as always but the video quality was really weird. like when I have rented the movie previously the quality was WAY better, Leading me to believe that this was a poorly made digital copy.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I was introduced to this singer just a week ago, on a (3 day) trip with my daughter and grandsons. Heard the cd a 'few' times, woke up with it stuck in my head. I just bought it, can hardly wait to find it in my mailbox. She is a mix between DIDO and Tracy Chapman.
B004VJJF34|3.0|The picture quality on this blu ray is inconsistent. The nightclub scene at the beginning of the movie looks good. I thought this was a good sign even though I was not thrilled that my rear speakers were silent. However the quality took a dive when Liza belted \\"But The World Goes Round\\". The picture quality was so grainy it was exactly the same as on my old DVD. But all is forgiven at the end of the movie when Liza sang \\"New York New York\\" in startling clarity. I do not regret purchasing this but I wish they had done a better job.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|This is a classic thriller in every sense of the word and really enjoyable. Some things annoyed the hell out of me, especially the dialogue tags. Every single line of dialogue had a tag, mostly he said, I said, he said, I said. Even when there were only two people in the scene. It drove me nuts! Also, some of Jack Reacher's clever working stuff out stretched credulity a bit too far, which was a shame. But on the whole the book was a very exciting, well researched counterfeiting thriller and I enjoyed the read.
B004RQVVGU|5.0|I pretty much only buy remastered versions of older recordings now,and I have to honestly tell you..without a doubt..this is the BEST job of remastering an older album that I have ever heard! Unlike the recent Black Sabbath remasters which arent really remastered at all(and there fore suck)The sound quality on the original album is SO MUCH better than Ive ever heard it before,and I go back to the vinyl release in 1982. And the live stuff is no slouch either! This is simply worth the price you will pay for it.Bought it on Amazon ,got it fast and the price is right .You MUST have this!
0399250573|5.0|I've noticed some of the other reviews on here and I see that some say that this book was \\"too sad\\". Well, it was sad, but things are looking up for Alex. The sad part really added an emotional level to the book, it made it more than just another extreme action book.     I'll have to say this... It was not my favorite Alex Rider book. I'm not altogether sure why, but Snakehead was the best, in my opinion. I think the overall plot of Snakehead was better, and that involved finding out about Alex's past, about his parents, about Ash.     But it really was a close call. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this book wasn't good in any way shape or form. Snakehead, well... I just enjoyed it more. But this thing really was blockbuster. It brought back old characters (Point Blank, hint, hint), and still had that emotional level that made Scorpia and Snakehead great and that Ark Angel didn't have.    Overall, I loved it. But there was something about it, just something, that made me hold it, in my mind, as 2nd best.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Initially wasn't thrilled with the simple, exclusive sound of the ukulele ~ but it absolutely grew on me & is my \\"go to\\" music! Genius, Mr. Vedder.
B000007R0S|5.0|I was hoping for this DVD audio format to improve of the excellently recorded concert. Well it's arguably slightly better balanced than the DVD video. At the expense of 2 fewer tracks including the tremendous \\"Help me through the night\\". It may well be the best recorded DVD concert out there, but I feel the DVD-audio falls a long way short of a SACD's superior 5.1 separation format. I can't complain as the Eagles - Hell Freezes Over concert, is just such an enjoyable experience. In the future, I may only purchase the DVD-Audio format where dts or 5.1 aren't available on video. I'm more than satisfied with the DVD video version of this concert. But left ever frustrated by the lack of hybrid SACD's out there in 2011.
B00008S2VH|3.0|The box package comes with stamps and a fold out poster. While the music here is well crafted, the lyrics to several songs are highly discomfiting.    American LIfe details her dissatisfaction with her current status. Well, Madonna has everything - fame, tons of money, power \\" DO you think I'm satisfied?\\" Maybe she had to make some sacrifices for fame but think of the millions who will gladly trade places with her.    Hollywood. \\"I lost my memory in Hollywood. I had a million visions bad and good...I tried to leave it but I never could.\\" Is she regretting her choice? I mean she did everything to make it in Hollywood. It's such a sinister place, she lost her mind and became a prisoner. Is she warning Hollywood wannabees about the place?    I'm So Stupid. Madonna chides herself for \\"believing in all the pretty pictures and wanting to be like all the pretty people\\" So she realised things are not what they seem and the in crowd can be mean and nasty? Remember, she wanted to be a star and become part of the Hollywood in crowd. It's kind of contradicting to say this.    American Life the album is good for the overly analytical and cynical or for those who likes contemplative, introspective stuff.     I don't play this as regularly as her 80s sruff. Songs such as True Blue still works better. Simple, catchy and positive.    \\"True love oh baby true love\\"    Spare me the subtext please.
B005869U6G|4.0|Incubus is many things, and ever-evolving is at the top of the list.<br /><br />Anoyone who expected more of the same from the guys clearly haven't heard much of their music. In that sense, If Not Now, When? isn't so surprising. However, the extreme altering they've done to their sound is. Make no mistake, this won't be the Incubus you're used to or expect to hear. Really though, the cover art depicts exactly what If Not Now, When? has to offer. Its a guy balancing on a wire. To me that's the perfect analogy. Basically they're walking that fine line (or, in this case, high wire) between being who they are, Incubus, and really pushing themselves musically in an entirely new direction.<br /><br />Were they successful? Honestly, it's a mixed bag.<br /><br />If you are a true Incubus fan you'll give this CD multiple spins before giving a final verdict. Which is exactly what you have to do in this case. This isn't the same Incubus that made Make Yourself or Morning View, let alone S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Personally, I was very disappointed the first time I heard this. I was upset that the tempo was so slow, that the lyrics were so simplistic in a lot of the songs, and that the band seemingly stepped back to let Brandon come forward more. However, repeated listens, and actually REALLY listening to the entire CD made me realize that, no, the band didn't step back, and while the songs may be slower, they very much contain the same amount of passion as any other Incubus record. The only qualm I had that remained was the simplicity of the lyrics.<br /><br />That is where my lone problem rests with If Not Now, When?. I can deal with the fact that they've slowed things down, they've been progressively doing that for the past four years. Sure, there are some lyrically excellent songs included such as Promises, Promises, Thieves, Isadore, and Defiance, yet for the most part there's just a lot of repeating. They don't seem to have as many thought-provoking moments as they used to. Look at Adolescents, the lead single. It's incredibly catchy and deserved to be the lead single, but the chorus consists of three lines. That's it. Even the verses are bare bones. That trend follows throughout the CD.<br /><br />Once you move past that one fault, this proves to be an excellent CD once you open your mind to it. The opener, If Not Now, When?, is a perfect, sublime, opener that really displays Brandon's voice in the best possible way. From there Promises, Promises brings in some of that Incubus flare, Thieves is an amazing song that poses a great question, Isadore follows much in the vain of 11:00 AM, Defiance shows how good Incubus is stripped down to only acoustics, Switchblade, the sore thumb of the bunch, successfully reminds us of the energy of songs like Blood on the Ground and Priceless, and Adolescents, like I said, is a terrific chorus driven track. The only songs I can't get into are In The Company Of Wolves and Tomorrow's Food. Even then, they're worth a listen. Tomorrow's Food is, lyrically, a very good song, I just don't really like the outcome and In The Company... just drags on too long.<br /><br />All in all, they could've done far worse. By reading the reviews you'd think that this was the worst CD of all time, but don't buy into a lot of it. Judge for yourself. Just go in with an open mind and expect the unexpected. Bands need to evolve and experiment or they'll get to the point where they put out the same CD over and over. Incubus has never done that, they've always evolved as a band, any fan knows that. This is just another adventure they've invited us to join them on. I, for one, am enjoying it.

B004LUNZ6Q|5.0|Sorry, I am not able to write my review in English.    Dès le début de ce Freischütz enregistré en 1958, l'impression est favorable. L'ouverture est dramatique, puissante même. Par la suite, on n'est pas déçu. Rien ne vient vous signaler qu'on n'a pas la représentation de campagnards allemands de Bohême, on est pas dans le post-moderne, pour une oeuvre dont l'authenticité presque populaire, la naïveté ou l'innocence si l'on veut, est comme redoublée par la nostalgie, puisque l'opéra de 1821 est censé rapporter une intrigue se passant au XVIIe siècle.     Entre atouts, Keilberth dispose de sa propre honnêteté, de sa connaissance, assumée sans distance, de tout l'univers germanique, de la splendeur de l'orchestre de Berlin, enfin d'une distribution qui a beaucoup de mérites. Certes, la voix et surtout la capacité d'évocation de Karl Christian Kohn ne se comparent pas à celles des meilleurs Kaspar : écoutez Kurt Boehme chez Furtwängler-1954 [[ASIN:B00004TYR3 Der Freischstz]] ou chez Jochum [[ASIN:B00099BPPG Weber: Der Freischütz]]. Mais on ne peut guère trouver mieux que l'Agathe d'Elisabeth Grümmer et même que la fine et joyeuse Ännchen de Lisa Otto. Le rôle de Max suppose du charme, de la vaillance, mais sans trop d'héroïsme, puisque l'intrigue lui attribue une certaine faiblesse. Rudolf Schock n'aurait pu être un Siegfried, mais comme Max, il est idéal. Gottlob Frick a au moins la voix d'un Ermite et Hermann Prey celle d'un Ottokar, encore que certains ont eu plus de grandeur que le premier et incarnent davantage le pouvoir princier que le second. Mais enfin, globalement, les rôles sont bien tenus.     On est pleinement satisfaits par la direction de Keilberth qui n'a tout de même pas la grandeur de Furtwängler, déjà cité, et à qui on ne reprochera pas de n'avoir pas l'élégance supérieure de Carlos Kleiber [[ASIN:B000006145 Weber: Der Freischütz ~ C. Kleiber]], qui n'est pas, à mon avis, ce qui est le plus nécessaire dans cette oeuvre, ni son génie. On est dans un studio, on ne l'oublie pas toujours, mais il y a le maximum de naturel et de vie qu'on peut avoir dans ces conditions. Keilberth n'est pas aussi inspiré que ses deux collègues, mais il est toujours crédible. N'oublions pas qu'il a dirigé, et toujours honorablement, une grande partie des opéras allemands, y compris Euryanthe et Obéron, dont le disque témoigne même pour l'avant-guerre [[ASIN:B00000I15X Oberon]]. Pour la scène de la Gorge-aux-Loups, Jochum et Carlos Kleiber sont davantage fantastiques, plus évocateurs. Dans la discographie de l'oeuvre, sauf à choisir Furtwängler, précaire techniquement, la version Keilberth est des plus conseillables.

B001CISHU4|3.0|I like Amon Amarth's music. Especially Oden, Fate, and Once Sent, and even the latest, Surtur Rising, but this seems glossed over, almost lazy. Not standing out at all in their collection. The music is still good, but there are much better Amon Amarth albums out there. Short of the singular solo addition from Roope Latvala, there isn't a whole lot going for this album other than Amon Amarth's great execution. Execution is one thing, but execution without inspiration is pointless. 3 stars for chops, 0 stars for anything else.
B000067DNC|5.0|one of the great science fiction shows that uses it's brains/intelligence/humor instead of relying on sex,foul language.great entertainment  for the whole family.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This falls into the classic genre of &quot;find things, figure out where they go, and then get more things.&quot;  There are a few puzzles, but not a ton.  Basically Myst Light.  Still, I had a blast for the hour it took to finish, and for a buck that's not bad.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|so i am an avid sports fisherman in real life.  i love this game.  i have beat it and plan on doing it again.  the use of tilt controls really adds to the fun.
B004LWZW24|4.0|The build up to this movie is perfect; just enough to keep you guessing and anticipating.  The 'events' will have your hair standing!  This movie reminded me of Polertgeist but is way more scarier.  It's been years since I've seen a movie that spooked me enough not to want to watch it alone!  Good movie!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It is sad what happened to Jaycee for 18 years.  I cannot believe what she went through. She had many chances to escape  but was so thoroughly brainwashed she did not try. I cannot believe the authoritys did not investigator more about her captor as he was a sex offender.  There are quite a few pages that I could not read because it was actual copies from a journal she wrote. I have a Kindle 3 and use the next to largest font available and was unable to read what the journal said even after I selected the largest font on the Kindle 3. Simon $ Shuster publishers had not offered this book in Text to speech so I missed a lot of things in the book.
0307719774|5.0|I'm in grad school right now and going through a lot of change and I feel that this will be interesting to go back through after I'm out of school and hopefully have a job! I like that you can start any day and the cycle will still work. I think I'm going to get a few as Christmas presents for my friends since it's the perfect price for gifts on a budget! Only complaint is that I wish it had a bookmark, but putting one in is no problem.
0385474547|4.0|It began as a requirement for African American History up to 1877 and became a very enjoyable read. It is a story about a father and son from two different worlds. The traditional African father whose beliefs reflected his native upbringing versus the son who has accpted Christianity. The title describes what happens to the father perfectly.     This is the story that put Achebe on the map. Read it and you'll find out why
0143143492|5.0|This CD set is fabulous!!  My mother and I have listened to it over and over again in our cars.  Everything Ekhart says makes perfect sense.  To live in the now is to be free. :-)
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|If I had known from the outset, that I needed to be in the mind-frame for a 1950's or 1960's genre film, I may have enjoyed it more.  Seemed like nothing more than a vehicle to show-case how glamorous Angelina Jolie could appear.  Love Johnny Depp, kept waiting for his character to break out in this movie.  He seemed to play such a milquetoast.  So disappointed in the role he played.  And I mean the role he was given to play, not the way he played it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Best alarm clock I have ever used. i have to habe my phone charging every night, why not use it ad an alarm clock. I have no desire to look for a better alarm app. This does everything.
0199537151|5.0|I thought the movie was good (circa 1933, all the others pale in comparison, but that is another review all together), until I read the source material for myself. Now I will not watch any iteration of it on celliod. Hollywood, has slowly killed an amazing story of man playing God. Only after playing God, did the good Dr. realize why man isn't a god.<br /><br />Even more amazing than the story itself is that Mary Shelly wrote this by the time she was 20 in the early 19th century.<br /><br />Definately a great way to spend your spare time. Infact, set aside some time just to read this one.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|I know, the book is always better....but in some cases it might be worhwhile just to bypass the movie.  No spoilers here, but where was all the snow and cold?  Rhea's(?) journey/story was surrounded with an icy, cold Hell, but in the movie it's almost springtime, or autumn; and, unfortunately, that's just one missing element of  ambience.<br />It's really, really hard to capture the nuance of the written work and transform into visual, but it has been done, sometimes wonderfully. Not so much here.  I liked the book so much I bought the DVD w/out a 2nd thought; try renting it first, is my advice...the book is so much better.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|After I got it, all my audio-loving friends liked it, and some of them bought it for themselves. This is a great product.
B004LWZW2E|1.0|Webster defines Boo as \\"expressing contempt or disapproval, or used to frighten.\\"  Unfortunately the film \\"Insidious\\" directed by James Wan can only fall under disappointing. Boo.  Not scary and not terrifying, painful, yes, in watching it to the end.<br /><br />Warning: Possible spoiler between dashes.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />\\"Insidious,\\" starring Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne play the father and mother who along with their three children move into a new house.  One of the young sons has the ability to leave his body through astral projection, also known as spirit walking, and becomes lost in the spirit world.  His shell of as body is now attracting spirits, evil ones, who want to come back into the real world.  Throw in some unexplained whispering and closing doors into the mix.  Enter the ghost hunters, a really laughable group, who must help the boy's spirit return.  The father, Patrick Wilson, who also has the ability to spirit walk, must venture into the spirit world to help his son find his way back.<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />At times the movie and its spirits reminded me of a cheap \\"Funhouse\\" carnival ride.<br />The only thing scary one might find in this movie of worn out clich&eacute;s is that their name may appear in the credits.  There are plenty of good horror movies out there, skip this one, but if you must see it go to your local library and check it out for free.  \\"Insidious\\" is worthy of only 1 Star.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I've loved all of the Harry Potter movies (and books.) I think the movies have done an excellent job staying true to the books and cutting out what isn't needed in the movies (mostly with the 4th and 5th one)<br /><br />The 1st part of the Deathly Hallows was good. It was slow, but the first chunk of the book was too. But I knew that this movie would be exciting and fast-pace. I was crossing fingers hoping it would go out with a bang.<br /><br />It did.<br /><br />As always, the acting is just fantastic. All of the actors are so talented. Never once does anything feel sub-par or faked or forced.<br /><br />The special effects were just...wow. I was impressed with how realistic the dragon was and Nagini looked just as real.<br /><br />I thought the movie would be depressing. After all, the 7th book was not exactly flowers and rainbows. However, the movie keeps a serious tone, but also throws in comedic lines to lighten the mood.<br /><br />So, as you can gather, I loved this movie. Why, you may be wondering, only four stars?<br />****SPOILERS****SPOILERS****<br /><br />Mostly because of how the deaths were handled. Most of the characters haven't been so much as mentioned (in part 1 or this one), so at the end of the first battle, when you see Fred, Lupin and Tonks, if you didn't know who died, you'd be thinking,\\"What?\\" Fred, in this film, only says, \\"Yeah.\\" (In reply to George's question, \\"Okay there, Freddie?\\") Then you see his dead body and instead of an emotional ending, you're thinking, \\"Oh...okay then.\\"<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />Also, the effects to make Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny look older could have been better. Harry looks a little bit older and they just put Ron in a fat suit. Besides that, it looks as though they just put on old person clothes and called it good.<br /><br />But besides that, this movies is amazing. I loved every second of it and it was the \\"bang\\" I hoped it would be.
B004ZGYEKC|5.0|This record simply gets more distinct as the years pass: a beautifully eccentric and frankly odd setting of impressions and ideas that remain unpredictable and absolutely filled with the sheerness of innocence, light and conviction, gratefully absent of commercialism, malice, posing or calculation. By all means, sit yourself down between the speakers and listen at different times of day, in different frames of mind with attention fixed or wandering. And offer the air around you some measure of appreciation that you lived to hear it.<br /><br />As for this particular incarnation: the stereo is masterful but, when it comes to what we really want, there is a profound and odd modulation issue with the mono version. Something's just not right with that mono disc. ( I'm listening on a Meridian reference transport, with upsampling and internal D/A conversion through a pair of monoblock Red Rose Tube Amps -- Black Sable and NOS valves -- and hybrid dynamic / ribbon towers.) If you doubt it, A/B it with the profoundly perfect remaster of Donovan Live and a few others of his, of the past few years, that capture the splendid bounce and holographic imaging reproduced by the best microphones of this period and you'll hear what I mean.<br /><br />Gear and technology aside -- as always and who really cares? -- be sure to Never Let This Music Die!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is a family friendly film that is just great every time around. Lots of funny quotes and hilarious action. Very inspiring movie as well. 5 stars for this one!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is a classic!  VERY 70's with a phenomenal Barbara and magnetic Kristofferson who make a truly beautiful couple.  The soundtrack is awesome; Kris' are raw with deep meaning and Barbara's are punchy and show a different side of her.  I waited a long time for this video to come out on DVD.  Love it!
B002IDH4PQ|5.0|Kid Cudi's Man On The Moon: The end of Day is a fantastic album, and sounds amazing on vinyl. Must Have!!
4770031246|5.0|This isn't just a lunch book, this is a great collection of recipes! The number one thing I love about this book is that the author has all sorts of tips and advice for eating right and packing the most healthy lunch. I find that these food is filling, delicious, and over all smart. This is amazing! :D
0679805273|5.0|I've given this book to all the grandkids in the family when they graduated from high school.  All of them were familiar with Dr. Suess from \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" to \\"Horton Hears a Who\\"  This is a bible for young people about to embark into the world.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|I watched this film for free on some satellite movie channel, and believe me, it wasn't worth it - even at that price. I'm stunned that two talented actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were in this dog of a movie. I love great science fiction and I'm willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief to enjoy a nice film, but that simply wasn't possible in this case. The movie is silly and implausible from beginning to end and revolves around two brilliant scientists who make infinitely stupid, unethical decisions - one after the other. With bad CGI and gripping dialogue between Adrien and Sarah like, \\"I don't even know who you are anymore\\", this is a film to avoid. Dumb.
0738711500|5.0|I have these cards and it is my first time using tarot cards and after only a few weeks I'm learning the cards and picking up meanings for them. they are very colorful with a lot of information on each card in the pictures themselves. I recommend these for anyone just starting out.
B000AYEL1A|2.0|This movie has a kind of \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" kitsch appeal that's hard to resist, even if it isn't very good (\\"Dolls\\" is flat-out ludicrously awful; \\"A Star is Born '76\\" doesn't rise above mediocrity). The score is mostly the kind of music your mother listened to in the 70's on AM radio. (Do people really love \\"Evergreen\\"? \\"Love--soft as an easy chair.\\" Do they think those are good lyrics?) I'd thought the picture was a gigantic flop when it was released, but I've learned recently it was the second highest grossing movie of the year. And the soundtrack is the biggest seller of Barbra Streisand's career. Baffling.    Steisand is, from the moment she appears onscreen, the fully formed singer and fully self-conscious celebrity she had been for almost 15 years at that point. Which kills the whole point of the movie. And everybody who meets her character immediately just loves her. Which also kills the whole point of the movie. For this story to work, we have to see the awkward and ignored girl with talent grow, gain her confidence, convince people of her talent, and become the star who is born in the course of the movie. That doesn't happen here.    This is a vanity project. We're not going to see Streisand slaving as a background singer and told angrily \\"We heard your voice to loudly!\\" the way we saw Garland playing an extra and told angrily \\"We saw your face!\\" (Even in the very first scene, when Streisand's a nobody, the two black girls in her trio are already just backup singers.) We're not going to see a woman unsure of her talent, or that she can go further than the marginal position she holds at the beginning of the movie, as we saw with Garland. (Streisand is hesitant when Kristofferson first tries to push her onstage, but they've already cut an album for her; it's the awkwardness of the situation, not her lack of self-confidence, that holds her back.) We certainly aren't going to see Streisand accidentally slapped, and publicly humiliated by her husband, as wesaw with Garland (Kristofferson's character only embarrasses himself; and intentionally punches a photographer).    Well, at least being a vanity project it looks beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous onstage and off, and the leads look great. (Knock Streisand for wearing clothes from her own closet if you want, but they look good in that very 70's Annie Hall fashion.) I do wish she hadn't insisted on incessantly being shot with a halo of light around her head.    But the movie also has huge gaps in credibility. Kristofferson is a country singer, not an Alice Cooper (though off the music stage, he gives the only convincing performance in the movie). And why would Streisand's character be attracted to someone from that particular world? Streisand isn't remotely a rock singer, and trying to be, she seems silly.  Then there's the weirdness that the people who make up the audience for Kristofferson's character would fall in love with Streisand's sound, or that the exact same people would want to handle them both. The movie doesn't take place in anything like reality, and doesn't succeed in convincingly creating its own reality. After Kristofferson's death,  Streisand runs through the house when she hears Kristofferson's voice on a tape. She's really not familiar with tape recording? In a house with it's own private recording studio? The source of sound is a tiny portable cassette recorder. How can it be heard across the mansion? A workman in the house turns out to have turned it on and asks helplessly \\"How do you turn this off?\\" Um, you press the button marked Stop instead of Play? It's the kind of player everyone owned at that time, not some confusing piece of high tech machinery. But they needed some feeble excuse for her to momentarily think he was back again, and then have her hopes crushed. What drama!    I was always under the impression the movie was a giant flop when it came out. Yet, bizarrely, it turns out to have been the second highest grossing movie ofthe year. And to judge by most of the comments here, continues to be loved to this day. I can't figure out why.
0307887960|5.0|Bought it.  Followed it.  Lost over 25 lbs. in less than 3 months, and still working on it.  Haven't gotten to the phases where you work on stabilizing your new weight and then re-incorporate all the stuff not included in the weight-loss phases.  I haven't felt deprived or hungry -- it's a matter, I think, of figuring out what you really like that falls in the categories allowed.  It does take a little will-power to stick to those things you like that are allowed and not just eat any old thing, but that is a diet, right?  The book is plainly written and easy to understand/follow, without sections or ramblings unnecessary to the point of the publication.  The doc does bother,though, to explain why the diet works/why the instructions are the way they are.  All in all, good book, and for me, good eating plan (I don't like the word diet).
B001I0T92Q|5.0|Why buy a memory stick for your PSP when you can get this? I had some extra micro sd's laying around the house from old cell phones and they work like a charm with this adapter. I am using an eight GB card for anyone that would like to know from the compatibility side. To get the micro sd card(s) to work with the adapter you must format them first with the device being used otherwise they will be unreadable. Overall, this is a great, cost effective product and very useful with the PSP.
B002RVCD6O|3.0|The movie was ok. I would say it's probably the worst of the first 6 slightly.<br /><br />I rented it via the Amazon internet rentals. Even though I got the \\"HD\\" selection for $3.99 it was not very high definition. I would have rented it locally if I had known how blocky some scenes would be, like the action-packed underwater part.<br /><br />The convenience of that was nice, but the price was steep as well. I would give the movie a 3 star but the Amazon rental a 2 star.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this story in one afternoon.  I pledge to work towards helping people fight back.  May you and your kids spend the rest of your lives in peace.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was so amazingly... real. I mean it hits all those in between pieces of a romance that most authors skip. I've never read a book with such an appropriate title because thats exactly what this book is about-A beautiful disaster. And i love love love how this author has brought to us, in the middle of the whole vampire-werewolf obsession, a good solid love story about humans *gasps*. And also they're not in high school! I'm first year of university as well and for once a book about people my age!<br /><br />I ADORED both the main characters Abby and Travis. They were perfect for each other. And i loved how all their imperfections weren't just smoothed over when they met and they didn't just get fixed over time. This book kind of makes me understand why people stay in relationships when looking in it looks like they make each other miserable. Because there's ALWAYS more going on than we can see.<br /><br />I really loved all the secondary characters America, Shepley and Travis' dad and brothers. The whole gambling thing and the underground illegal fighting system was really interesting as well and brought a new dimension to the story.<br /><br />This is definitely without a doubt one of the best books i've read all year. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wether or not your a romance fan.
B005BW0MUK|4.0|\\"Fear Of The Dark\\" was the first album by Iron Maiden I ever listened to. I really loved it back then. Nowadays I still listen to it on a fairly regular base and I still love it, just not quite as much as I used to. I mean, the first half of the album up until \\"The Fugutive\\" and also the song \\"Judas Be My Guide\\" rock. \\"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\\" is the highlight of the album and an all-time Maiden classic with everything you love in a Maiden song. Somehow, I do not care so much for the title track, though, many will say otherwise and consider it a classic, too. (maybe it's the lyrics for me, I don't know). So, in comparison to \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" it is in part a step toward a more traditional Iron Maiden, again. \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\" is a great opener, very fast paced. \\"Weekend Warrior\\", \\"Chains of Misery\\" and \\"The Apparition\\", while not being bad songs, feel a little dull to me. \\"Wasting Love\\", a ballad, I sometimes like to listen to, sometimes don't, depending on the mood. All in all a good album, definitely worth owning.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|If you're looking into buying this box set, you're probably already a fan of the series, so all I'll say about that is that the series' mysteries are creative and the actors have great chemistry.     This DVD box set gets 5 stars because it's packed with extras and commentaries. There are, quite literally, hours of special features here - 10 of the 13 episodes have cast, producer or writer commentaries and 2 episodes have multiple commentary tracks, so you get different perspectives on what happens in those episodes. Then, there are 3 making of featurettes, 6 behind the scenes video blogs, 3 cast interviews and a sneak peak at Season 2. (Thumbs down that there's no commentary for ep 10, though, since it seemed like kind of an important one for the relationship between Audrey and Nathan.)    So, if you're a fan of the show and are interested in finding out more about the thinking behind the episodes straight from the talents' mouths - not filtered through journalist interviews - you'll really appreciate the effort that was put into this set.  It sure beats those box sets which are basically all the episodes and then a crappy 3 minute featurette that gets tacked on as a second thought.
B000XA5K48|3.0|Okay this was not the greatest movie ever made but it did have many moments that had me laughing. It is obvious that this movie is meant to be more of a comedy and a spoof of action movies than a true action movie. However I do not think this is the kind of movie to be making political statements about the 2nd amendment as the main character shoots everything and everyone he sees from beginning to end. I know the director has freedom of speech but the contradiction is a little weird. Like the people who are against eating meat but they still wear leather shoes and leather belts. Okay I am finished. All in all it is still a funny movie.
B003F5WOEC|4.0|I like this album.There are a lot of complaints it doesnt sound like their earlier albums.I think thats a good thing.Theyre evolving as a band.Keep doing the same thing the same way and it gets stale.Personally, I like the older stuff and the newer stuff.Keep evolving I say.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Don't stare into those eyes for too long. You'll see them in your dreams if you do...not the little boy's but rather the black and red-faced creature's.<br /><br />Good flick. Nice violin and smash-hands-on-a-piano music. I personally was pretty cool throughout the whole movie, though I think everyone has a certain variety that specifically \\"does it\\" for them. I found \\"The Rite\\" to be more mine.<br /><br />It's interesting to read the comments here on amazon and the opinions / beliefs on what they call astral projection. It's one of those things that you really cannot disagree with someone on, and nobody can tell whether someone else did or didn't experience what they say they did. But, rest assured now that it's \\"out in the open,\\" those who claim they have had such experiences will begin to reference to this movie to try to make their case stronger...as if that will help instead of bringing giggles.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This is a great size pool and the decorations are cute. It is bigger than the other ones you see with a slide, but it is not deep (even the \\"deep end\\" has an overflow valve so it doesn't get very deep). It is still plenty of fun for my 6 year old and 3 year old. Like another reviewer wrote, the pool does deflate slightly each day. I just pump it up a bit the second day and when I dump the water, I deflate it completely when not in use. Good value for the money especially because of the extra inflatable toys and the sprinkler system.
1591843162|5.0|\\"You have to like Seth Godin's books. His super conversational writing style makes all of his books enjoyable reads. Linchpin is relevant for today's marketer and speaks directly to those change champions....those who refuse to \\"do\\" just to \\"do\\" and dream big because they believe all things are possible. Very inspiring and my only disappointment was that Seth wasn't sitting across from me on the plane while I was reading it so I could get him to elaborate on a few things he touched on. Get it for your team, product or marketing, and even sales would benefit from reading this book. \\" [...]
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I absoloutely love horror films, and to be more specific I love zombie movies. But, with every zombie movie, it must end.. or it just gets dragged on, IE Resident Evil.<br /><br />If you're in my shoes, trust me you will LOVE this series. It is simply amazing. Just as a little FYI this series is based off the comic books The Walking Dead created by Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore.<br /><br />First off, I love the characters, and I also love that their story is unpredictable. In a movie you can basically tell who is going to live and who is going to die. In this series its up in the air; if there is any one character you expect to live you may be surprised. Not to mention the fact that they're all really great actors. My favorite characters are Rick Grimes, whom the story primarily focuses on (played by Andrew Lincoln.) His journey into this new world overtaken by zombies begins in a hospital bed. He has been neglected after a gun shot wound, and walks out into the real world to find everything he loves is gone. Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) is another character to watch out for. He's a military vet, and is handcuffed to a metal pole as impending doom is knocking at his door (literally.) Don't worry though, he finds a way to survive... by removing his own body part. And finally you have Glenn (Steven Yeun) who provides comic relief to the characters as they are enduring the Zombiecolypse, haha<br /><br />Another thing to watch for: the zombies themselves. My fiance and I agreed the zombies in this series are probably one of the best special effect make-up we've ever seen. They truly are a work of art, something you have to see for yourself. Not to mention the fact that the zombies must be killed by destroying the brain, and the show spares no expense showing the viewers the gruesome scenes.<br /><br />This isn't your typical zombie movie. These people are trying to survive during the zombie attacks... and just when you think they're safe.......... well, see for yourself :)<br /><br />The only negative that I have about this series is that it is wayyyy too short. This is normally why I only purchase series when I know they are done filming, and I can buy a complete set... and not have to wait until October 2011 to see what happens! (Even longer actually, we don't have TV out here so I have to wait until it comes out on DVD.)ve that I have about this series is that it is wayyyy too short.

B0038AUY96|5.0|My first Jo Nesbo read, and what a treat it was! I was engrossed from beginning to end, as the book had lots of surprises, and twists and turns throughout. I do hope all the rest of the books from this author offer the same good reading experience.
