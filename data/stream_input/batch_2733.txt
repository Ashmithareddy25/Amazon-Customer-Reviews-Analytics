B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is fun but does not have all the mincemeat features. This a great games for on the go and on car rides. It takes a wile for the updates to come out but you will get used to it.it's is made by Mojang which means it's not another ripoff from some fake guy  making a scam. You can't play Online But you can play LAN. There are only two difficulties peaceful and has not yet been added. Skins have also not been added yet without hacking. Overall I think this is a great app and I hope you found this helpfull
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a very addicting game. I'm always on it and I can't stop pinning thing. I'm on way to much.<br />AMAZING APP :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game keeps my son occupied for awhile he loves the minions. When they laugh he cracks up at them..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging, makes one think outside the box. Limited directions force one to use their skills in problem solving so that they can escape each floor. I enjoyed each level especially the floors that had more than one area to look in.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This book was riveting, informative, and eye-opening.  I have talked about this book with so many friends and co-workers and they've all purchased it and have had the same reaction I did.  It's shocking to learn just how much engineering has went into our food in order to make us want it even more.  I will never again eat processed food.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|Well done.  A provocative story made real by incredible acting by Helen Hunt and William H. Macy.  Just the right touch of humor in what could be a depressing story.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I'm a committed Christian--he's a committed Muslim..we are obviously going to disagree on who Jesus is.  It's a good read..I do find it scant on support when backing up his assertions about the &#34;why&#34; ---as in why the NT writers has to invent the story of the resurrection to save face (for lack of another way of putting it).  He goes in with the supposition that the resurrection is a verifiable non-fact and writes from there.  It is an easy, good read.  And I just disagree with him lock, stock, and barrel.  He makes the good marketing statement that he can follow Jesus without being a Christian. I believe , as well, that the majority of humanity does not  find fault with the moral lessons that Jesus taught.  But in order to call yourself a Christian..well....that whole Son of God, resurrection, sin, salvation  thingy...kinda has to be there....
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Oprah includes notes on quotes at the end. Very useful.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed is a real and fascinating author. You'll love it!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|AFTER WATCHING SOME OF THE LATER SHOWS I JUST HAD TO GO BACK TO  ITS START AND AS EXPECTED THIS ONE GRABS YOU RIGHT AWAY AND WONT LET YOU GO. ITS FIRST CLASS ACTING WRITING AND PHOTOGRAPHY . TV AT ITS VERY BEST. CANT WAIT FOR THE LAST EPISODES THIS AUGUST.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cool awesome just like subway surfers and temple run and temple run two first I saw this game I thought it would be cheap but I regret it it is the bomb
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a pretty good game but could use some improvements in my opinion. For the most part I do enjoy the game.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE, IVE SEEN ALL THE HERO FLICKS, I LIKE EVERY ONE OF THEM, HULK SEEMS TO CHANGE A LOT AND KIND OF STOLE THE SHOW IN THIS ONE! WISH THOR PLAYED A MORE CENTRAL ROLE SINCE HE COULDVE DONE ALL THE WORK HIMSELF WITHOUT THE AID OF THE REST!! DONT NEED ALL THEM OTHER HEROES RISKING THIER LIVES WHEN YOU COULD DO IT WITH ONE GUY WHO IS IMMORTAL, LIKE IF IT WERE JUST HIM AND HULK THEY COULDVE HANDLED IT EASILY!!!
B009LMTDL0|1.0|Amateurish attempt to coach. Points aren't well supported by anything but crony-ism. This is not useful coaching for the everyday business-person. Don't waste your money.
B00D4ABW82|4.0|This sounds just like their previous albums. And that is a good thing. I wish it was longer. Not much else to say.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is an awesome game I love it and I love playing it. also I like all the other gameloft apps as well.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Dont listen to the fools that say this movie is boring or no good on here. Goslings acting is just unreal in this film. He can throw you a glaring look that says a thousand words. The lighting in the movie is also great. The sound tracks are awesome and fit perfectly. If you like the crappy Fast and the Furious movies then Drive is not for you and you would not know what a good movie is anyways if you like those terrible Fast/Furious nonsense crap movies. 5 stars.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|How do you see? Do you see what is happening or just what you expect to happen? Are you brainwashed or can you think out side of the box? I challenge you to test your thinking by watching Life of Pi.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the dimension of emotion in this series.  Inventive with infamous characters. Human yet raw and painfully and beautifully told.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Best movie ever, I love it! No matter what keep showing happiness for your kids is always a good feeling.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I loved this movie, the acting was super, Ryan Gosling, Rachel Mcadams, were great. Gene Rowland & James Garner<br />what a pair. This movie help you better understand when a family member has dementia. Ryan & Rachel what a couple, they are one of my favorites stars, especially Rachel Mcadams. Love, Love this movie. The whole cast was great.<br /><br />Liz Martinez
B007IXWL2C|2.0|does not have any redeeming v alue,  I only read a chapter or less, thought it might have  some  value but didn't find any  kinda like reading jr high girl trying to be cool and show her knowledge of sex  bahahahhahahah
B00A4TKDKY|4.0|Buddy Guy's legend continues to grow. He's best live and now ranks with B. B. King as<br />a  true blues legend.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Using evidence based on psychology and biology studies, Paul Tough explains how character, rather than just simply grades, IQ or SAT scores matter in determining success in life. This has huge implications for schools, educators and parents.
B00BKU9ZFU|4.0|A much-needed new voice comes to jazz.  Can't wait to see how Salvant's artistry  evolves. Best new female talent since Krall, Monheit and Peyroux?  We'll see.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful and poetic, thoughtful and intense, this book is well worth the read. It takes a new look at cancer and the meaning of life, and lays it before the reader effortlessly and perfectly. I reread the last chapter just so it wouldn't have to end.
B00BY1F8UQ|4.0|As usual, the trio of Jarrett, Peacock and DeJohnette brings innovative flare and meticulous musicianship to new compositions as well as classics.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Close to book line. Acting and creativity excellent. Ease of downloading great. I enjoy having prime download movies from amazon
0393037010|5.0|Beware. Opening these first pages will transport you into the late eighteenth century British Navy; part of you will never return. You will witness the first, unlikely meeting of Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin--and after you've been drawn into this series, you will look back at that first shaky encounter as an historic event. O'Brian has combined a life's work of research and an unquestionable love of the era into a sublime recreation of a world long vanished. You will thank the author for his generosity; 20 separate portals into another world that will continually call you to return.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The is the best my computer can not have minecraft on it so since the I a pocket edition of this it works out perfectly
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Mc4 is an all around solid game. plenty of weapons to choose from and plenty of game modes to play.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|Great movie. It holds true to the original somewhat. There are parts that make you wish for the outcome to be exactly what it was. Good entertainment.
0879306033|5.0|a wonderfull book<br />I keep reading it<br />and okee I also keep looking at the pictures<br />one extra chapter should be in it, on Roland. yhey deserve a chapter<br />otherwise very good book
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I ordered it and never received it. Maybe it is my Kindle Fire(junk edition). If I ever receive it then I can review it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Complex, interesting. and compelling!! Great acting and script!! Well worth the viewing!! Great characterization, plot, and subplots and dialogue! Great!!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|this has been my favorite movie since i was 5 I had to own it and watch it whenever i want
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The writing, acting and cinematography is first rate. This season wasn't as good as previous years, but the story is still quite engaging. A great set of DVDs.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|For even the advanced this is a must have app<br />Affordable easy to use and all inclusive however I believe that if there was a way to charge as fast as Asus tansformer tf 300 would be nice
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved! Perfect romantic novel for summer reading. I love Nicholas Sparks and fall in love with his books every time. The book is also way better than the movie!
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|This book finally came thru in that it answered several questions about the monolith, the story actually concludes and does not leave you hanging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Greatest game always fun and loads quick love it and fun I always want more it keeps you coming back
B000JMKQX0|4.0|have not seen the movie yet, the book was good and worth reading, hope the movie follows the events and story in the book as they occurred.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George RR Martin is a wonderful author,  This book, like the others in the series was a hard one to put down...couldn't wait to see what happened next.  I can hardly wait for the last two to be published,.,,,,write faster George!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|We all like to play this one.from my four year old my eight year old and myself we love it
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is great and easy to use. Keeps me more organized on the go. I have an HTC Thunderbolt and I use the voice to add my lists. Highly recommend it!
B005HSL626|1.0|two words, hate-it. all you can do is classic mode and you cant unlock all of the bales because you have to purchase the full version in order to do that
1452126577|5.0|I love this book, I sat there laughing the entire time I was reading it. Sure there are some memes that you can find online thrown in there that I've seen before but the other content (Anatomy of a Frown, How to Get in a Grumpy Mood, etc) is perfect. I can't believe there are some \\"just ok\\" reviews! This is the perfect Grumpy Cat book.
B000ITF86E|5.0|This movie is timeless.  the chemistry and comedy of the actors still works today. You will be laughing from beginning to end.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Great picture quality. Again when Hollywood made movies that got you thinking. For the price it's worth the anniversary edition.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|We play this often when we need to kill some time; out to dinner, on game night when we're waiting for people to arrive, etc. It's a quick game that is easy to understand, even for my 5 year old. The zombie aspect is much more entertaining to him than normal dice. I highly recommend this game.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Some poor reviews on it. I find this Bond fits the times better then the earlier ones. I still like to watch the earlier bonds also, it's all a matter of ones personal taste.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a must read for anyone interested in the history of the technology industry, or in technology design. Steve Jobs was a visionary in design, and this book really chronicles his life and philosophies. It's long, but well worth it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I purchased the kindle version of the set and I can't seem to put it down.  I take my Kindle with me every where I go just<br />in case I find 10 or 15 minutes to get back into the books.  I purchased the set to find out what happens since I also got<br />engrossed in the HBO series but the books are even better.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This \\"review\\" is linked to the \\"font package\\" software, but the comments here also obtain to OfficeSuite Pro v7.  Font pack or no, this software will not properly display Excel graphs.  I'm not even concerned here with the mathematical issues of the spreadsheets - just wanted the ability to display graphs.<br /><br />Excel graphs will display, but not with any of the attributes they had in the Microsoft software (MS Office 2010).  Legends are all moved to the right of graphs (a default position), fonts on the axes are HUGE, often overlapping to the point of illegibility, and so on.  Completely hoses any stylistic touches and generally looks really, really bad.  I thought the \\"Font package\\" might at least address the latter issues, but no cigar.<br /><br />I don't know what this software is good for, but if  you're hoping that Office Suite Pro 7 ($15) or this Font Package ($5) will improve display of Excel graphs on your Kindle Fire HD 8.9 - that has NOT been my experience.  The \\"bait\\" version of Office Suite that came on the Kindle was as good as it gets for the display of Excel graphs - not encouraging news - but then again, who expects to do any real spreadsheet work on one of these toys?<br /><br />For the record, if you haven't found where to place xlsx files on your Kindle for Office Suite to find them, the default folder (in Windows Explorer) is Kindle\Internal Storage\Documents\Sidecars.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Both me and my four year old grandson have fun playing it.  No violence, just fun!  Should have more games like this one.
125000098X|1.0|Best to borrow so you can return or buy in Kindle version so you can delete this book, unless you want to learn how a book...surely not this 1...makes it to the top 15 best seller list, or how the upper crust lives, or how elections can be manipulated.  I felt like I was seated at a circus with too many acts performing, and when it came time for the grand finale, the tent simply fell on top of me.  Perhaps I'm old fashioned, but I expect an author to identify earlier on a direct path to follow, where characters have meaning other than to fill space and pages.  Best kept secret's why this even got published.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really fun game, bingo with items to collect, slots with items to collect, daily free bingo tournament. You can gift and trade items with friends. Buying items is a problem though, no refunds even if it doesn't go thru.
0788859544|5.0|I GOT THIS FOR THE MY GRAND DAUGHTER, WHO OF COURSE LOVES PRINCESSES. MY DAUGHTER (27) ENDED UP WATCHING IT SEVERAL TIMES
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I DID  LIKE THE CUTTER, JUST HAD TROUBLE WITH THE CUTTER STAYING ON THE CUTTER IT SELF. DIAMOND TECH, INC. NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE WAY THE CUTTER HOLD ON.
B002NOH7G6|5.0|This movie was intense and true to the time period. Anyone who enjoys ancient history and action needs to watch this film. The HD was incredible.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Good movie for kids and adults alike. Quite the fairytale using these cute little guys. All my friends (especially with kids) raved about it so I just had to get it. Very cute for all ages.
B0064HJX56|3.0|I found this book to be okay. It continues the story and tries to develop threads to ground us in book three. I found that it took a long time to get to the point.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|This movie was really confusing to me and a few of my friends. I think maybe if I watched it again I might think better of it. It was hard to track the things that were going on. I have always loved Tom Hanks and was pretty disappointed in this one
B008XG1X18|5.0|I stumbled across Pinterest a year ago and have been a big fan ever since. The app is as easy to use as the desktop version.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|&#34;Undeniably scary&#34; as one of the critics wrote on the jacket, I would have to agree with him on this one. It's a pretty good horror. If you enjoy these types of movies I would definitely recommend this one! I thought it was pretty awesome!
B0063M22QO|3.0|The game is okay to play but not as much fun as the Windows version on my computer.  I do like the shuffling of remaining tiles when you've matched all you can.  You can choose whether to play timed or not, with sound or without.  Graphics are very good on the Kindle Fire HD.  But on the Windows version I can alternate between various layouts and keeps statistics on percentage of completed games.  So this is okay if I'm traveling because my Kindle Fire HD is so easy to carry anywhere, but at home I prefer to play the game on my computer.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|One of the best Science Fiction movies I have seen in a long time. It's story was fresh. The actors did a great job. The film was enjoyable. I really enjoyed it.
B00CLD65X0|4.0|Why is it that every time they have a baby someone has to die?  Its getting to be more soap opera ish
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I liked the movie and the thrill of watching Mama. It had a very odd storyline but very enjoyable. It had it's moments of scare All I can say is watch it I don't think you will be disappointed, I wasn't.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it was okay because it was hard to control. I think you should just stick with the computer for now.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Excellent movie for the &#34;action freaks&#34; I thoroughly enjoyed this one! Bruce Willis has once again come through for me! It is full of action with bursts of comedy. Has a story. Take it from me this one is a keeper!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love the Twilight Series! Breaking Dawn is phenomenal, brilliantly written, and absolutely intriguing to any audience. Stephenie Myer is a sophisticated, daring author who takes fantasy and science fiction to a totally different level of amazing. Any reader will enjoy every Twilight Book written by Stephenie Myer!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I just got mine today. It works good overall but there are things you should know.<br />It requires you to use the USB power adaptor to wall socket to get power. People mentioned it should power from HDMI but it does not seem to do that. You need to use USB power adaptor which adds little clutter with wiring.<br />I had problem setup because the setup could not connect to my WIFI network using my iMac for some reason. This was frustrating. But I ran setup on my PC and it could detect WIFI network and worked fine.<br />Netflix and Youtube worked fine on Mac and iPhone and Mac.<br />Mirroring from Chrome works fine too from PC or Mac.  However you cannot mirror chrome from Ipad or Iphone - it NOT supported yet. So it is kind of inconvenience to use your Mac or PC as remote for TV when mirroring.<br />I have Amazon Instant Video too and you can mirror video to TV when you watch video over web on Amazon website.<br />CNET gave it so so review mentioning that for $15 more ROKU does more with tons more apps including Amazon Instant Video. So there is some regret but I am hoping that more apps will eventually come out for Chromecast. But for $35 it is still good deal especially if you do not have Apple TV or Roku before. I bought it on first day so I should be getting Netflix free offer but I am still waiting for any email about this - I have not gotten anything about Netflix free offer.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I LOVED This book.. I mean it's the best that I read in a while. Always had me on the edge of my seat.<br />LOVED This Book.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Bought it for my girlfriend, and she's watched it 15+ times already.  Loves it.  I've seen it myself,  and it was pretty entertaining.
1500376809|5.0|Unique plot line with a host of cool characters.  It's a fast and engaging read.  Hope the series continues, as I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I Put this in the pocket of my Schrade and fits perfect. Sharpens great and will last me a lifetime!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington's character reminded me of some of my own family members who share similar tolerances to alcohol. The film is well paced and moving. I laughed in many parts, and could relate with others. A true functional alcoholic who saved lives, but still owns up to his own addictions.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This entertains my twin three year old grandsons more than anything. So glad to have it. They get so excited.
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|Loved watching all the weapons and technological gizmos that were used in this film. Reminded me of a military operation. Of course having dinosaurs running around snacking on people is always entertaining too.
0788859544|5.0|Movie is an all time classic that we introduced to our 2 year old daughter on her birthday. She loves it!
B00C1BU8G2|3.0|It was a recent watch. But for the most part it was just capitalizing on the first 2 movies. More of the same here. Just a few newer special effects.
B001C34HUS|3.0|As an avid reader of business books, I got this one to try and stimulate my creative side. I found it to be a bit dry and formulaic. Quick read.
B004RGHWIQ|5.0|I bought the first 3D coraline and watched it on a regular TV using the glasses.  The 3D effect was underwhelming at best, I found no \\"ahhhhh\\" when the birds came out or any of the other great scenes.  I watched this version on a 3D computer screen using NVidia shutter glasses and I was totally blown away.  The effects where actually better than I recall from the theater.  Stunning and cute movie, the details really stand out and nothing is missed in this version.  The extras where a welcome addition and completes this package.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I could, and have, listen to it twice in a row. Britney, so glad you Held on.
161655164X|5.0|This is a great book if you're into seeing how concept art is created. I'm a fan of the game and it looks amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun challenging game that will get the wheels turning. I can't wait till they add more levels.
B00009RAJH|2.0|By looking at the photo of the &#34;Delux Edition&#34; one would think that they were getting Fleetwood Mac &#34;Rumors.&#34;  However, due to the utter dismay of the receiving party, many of the &#34;Rumors&#34; songs weren't on this compilation.  I would have gladly paid for the original &#34;Rumors&#34; album then this.  In essence it was a waste of money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this series of books. I can't put the book down. I have already downloaded book three. Got to go see whatsoever. Bye.
B003G8Y4QO|3.0|Obviously I love Dr Who so there's nothing to review about the show.  I'm used to watching Who on Netflix, but the 5th season wasn't out when I wanted to watch it so I bit the bullet and bought it off Amazon.  The picture quality was great, the convenience was great, but the playback is awkward.  Fast-forwarding or rewinding is much more cumbersome than on Netflix.  I couldn't find close-captioning anywhere, major downer for me.  I don't regret buying it, but I wish Amazon programmers would watch Netflix and pick up some more user-friendly ideas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its a great game! A good way of keeping your mind working and able to react fast. Need the upgrade that has the phone version. Great colors
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I read this book because it was chosen by my book club.  I cringed a bit as it's not my usual fair. 'Oh great, another young woman finds herself' book.  (I was not a particular fan of 'Eat, Pray, Love' chosen a few years ago by the same book club member who recommended this).<br /><br />Strangely though I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Cheryl is completely flawed, broken and battered, but somehow makes us understand that it's ok.  Sometimes we need to embrace our wounds completely instead of hiding from them or burying them beneath questionable personal choices.<br /><br />This book reminds me of a saying I love; 'I'll be ok, just not today.'  I never doubted that Cheryl was going to prevail, but it's not very often that we get to go through this kind of personal journey with someone else.  Set this quiet indomitable spirit against the beautiful majesty of the Pacific Crest Trail and you have story that's impossible not to enjoy.
B004UID2LC|5.0|you can download to you mp3 or gallery and watch any videos you want.so I think you should get this app
B004I9G486|5.0|I have an VW CC and my MDI cable went out and the  VW deallership wanted to much money. This cable saved my life and my wallet, it arrived on time and works great!
B0015XAT3Y|3.0|I really only wanted two songs off of this album, but the cost entire album was about the cost of 4 or 5 songs.  But the crazy thing is the cost of the actual CD was 1$ cheaper than the MP3 download price - which also includes the MP3 download!  What kind of accounting smoke & mirror shenanigans is up with that?<br /><br />As to the music, as a kid I listened to this album on my record player an entire summer.  I loved it.  Listening to it again decades later, however, just didn't do it for me.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It's the Adventures! What else should I say? It's everyone's facorite characters all bundled up in one. Made feel like I can kick some a#%
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|Last year I read Anna Karenina and was quite dismayed with all of the boring references to farming during that time period.  This movie edits out all of the author's tangents and sticks to the main theme.  Well done but glad I waited to see it at home instead of the theater.  Nice but somewhat forgettable.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|The writing of the series is amazing there is always a twist you don't see coming. I have even started watching the old series because of this.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Nothing on TV? This was a pretty fun movie and both my husband and I liked it.  He only likes movies with action or aliens and I tend to like comedies or drama.  We were both pleasantly surprised.
B00CLF80O0|1.0|This Cd is so compressed , so loud . so poorly mixed that i will never listen to it because it's impossible. So what's the point of buying music , just listen to it on youtube where it sounds just as bad. The last Whitesnake on vinyl sounded like a MP3 file put on vinyl. Sorry mates I'm done buying.<br /><br />STARKER 7-13
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Didn't get a chance to see this in the movie theater so I saw it on HD Amazon.  It was really entertaining.  Worth it!  Got swept away and didn't once think about comparing it with the book.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This application does not work on a tablet Samsung Tab 2. Very Quickly uninstalled. shame. See you soon Bye Bye
B009JZPH32|3.0|This movie did not live up to expectations.  Far fetched overall.  Graphic sex scenes unnecessary.  The love triangle was ridiculous.  Two guys sharing this woman and living happily in a drug fueled haze with unlimited finances thanks to selling high grade weed.<br />Some good performances yes, but overall, not a very good movie.  I am being generous with 3 stars.
B000V5ZIBU|5.0|I LOVE the first Episode of DS9 it is in my top ten. Character Development is wonderful and it has alot of background info well done into a condense episode. I highly recommend this to anyone who is starting Star Trek and wants a good start into it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|When I ordered my Chromecast from Amazon at 7:56PM PST on July 24th, there was absolutely no indication on the website that the Netflix promotion had ended at 5:31PM. Every website, including Google's official website, said that the promotion was valid.<br /><br />Today I logged in to check my order and saw the notice on the product page. This was DEFINITELY not there when I placed the order.<br /><br />\\"Please note that the Netflix promotional offer (which was available in limited supply) has now ended. Customers who ordered their Chromecast prior to 5:31 PM PST on July 24, 2013 will receive a Netflix gift code via email within 5 days of their product's ship date.\\"<br /><br />Apparently I missed it by ~2.5 hours.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon's famous customer service expecting full well that they would see how shady this is and make things right, but the agent basically told me to get lost and that I was in the wrong.<br /><br />I promptly canceled my order out of sheer principal. I might order it again from either gPlay or Best Buy when it becomes available again.
B009AMANBA|2.0|This was a real &#34;snoozer&#34; of a movie for me.  Good acting but I thought there would be more action but it was about the dilemma of the slavery issue & how Lincoln had to consider different aspects of the issue & face his adversaries.  I feel asleep in the middle of the movie and will donate it.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I think that you should read this book after you read the other books it will make more sence but It would also be fun to read it before and have you're mind trying to figure out alot of it but over all it's a great book
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Beautifully written book about his experience on the other side of the veil.  Compelling and a page turner.  Enjoyed this read!
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|The pianist, Leon Fleisher, recorded for Epic records (a CBS label) from 1954 to 1963.  His popularity at the time was overwhelmed by that of Van Cliburn on RCA.  He was no less of a great artist.  Sony (the present owner of the CBS label) has released this wonderful limited edition box set of 23 CDs of Fleisher's Epic recordings and his later Sony recordings from 1991 to 2008.  His most famous recordings were those of the Beethoven and Brahms piano concerto cycles with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra.  There are several recordings here with Szell.  However, the most interesting discs are those rare Epic albums that have never appeared on CD before:<br />Debussy and Ravel<br />Hindemith<br />Copland/Kirchner/Sessions/Rorem<br />There are other recordings of Schubert, Brahms, Lizst etc.  But the discs of 20th century music are the treasures of this set.  The original Epic recordings were in mono and later in stereo.  4 of the 23 discs are of the later Sony recordings.  Each mini \\"LP\\" album has it's original album art and a hardbound booklet with notes and recording info.<br />This is a Limited Edition release, so go for it ASAP!

B009AMANBA|5.0|The cast is a who's who of actors and they all comport themselves with brilliance. Understated where the character requires it, bombastic when it suits. Daniel-Day Lewis performs the role of his career as Lincoln, Sally Field is extraordinary as Lincoln's wife, as are the children who portray their sons.<br />One is a voyeur into the lives of these people, and it is sometimes uncomfortable to watch, but never overwrought.<br />The political scenes are brilliantly done, and you really get inside the political world of the period.<br />This film spans the last few months before Lincoln is assassinated, and concerns itself with the ending of the Civil War and the Anti-Slavery Bill.<br />This film should be shown in every school in America, so we are reminded of what one human being can do to another, based on colour, race, religion, mode of dress, sexuality, whether 200 years ago or today. The moral of the film remains utterly relevant.<br />A must-see for all.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|great book, not a big reader but once I started to read it could not put the book down. great book
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|A terrific ensemble cast and great script define this film. Quartet is a divine film. It's like getting a box of chocolates and discovering you love every single piece in the box. All the actors are brilliant and complement Dame Maggie Smith, who is the aging diva come to live. The music is wonderful and the directing is brilliant.<br />This could not have been filmed in the US with and American cast. It just wouldn't have worked.Dustin Hoffman has outdone himself in his directorial review and I look forward to seeing what he does next. Quartet is a very difficult act to follow.<br />A must-see, must-have film!!

B004QOB8SY|5.0|The best Show I ever seen, and an extraordinary actor....Benedict the best Sherlock, he is simple amazing impossible don't watching
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is addictive and fun. I wanted something engaging but not too consuming. This one fit the bill. Recommended for light gamers.
B00BWDJILG|3.0|I hear the &#34;musicality&#34; in this CD. I sense the direction-----using strings.<br />However, there is so much energy in the string writing {ie let me show you my &#34;chops&#34;] that most of the time there is not enough room for the tenor sax to breathe. Also, the writing indicates that  the lyrics of the songs [which gives one the sense of the somgs emotional  quality[ were not considered.<br />If they do it again-----open up the form-----let the sax breathe !
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i would reccommend this game to others. i dont love it because there is only 10 levels that can keep you waiting for the next 5 levles :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a good game not just for fun but to help think a little more but in all it was a fun game and a little hard
B00119ZMKW|4.0|A Classic. Not as campy as the original Star Trek, but very creative and humorous.I like this show a lot. Atlantis is also good.
B007HO392S|5.0|This CD has exceeded my expectations. Carrie has addressed so many of life's issue on just as many levels. She's not only a positive influence through her music but also in the way she lives her life. The commitment to her marriage, over anything else, says a lot about her integrity. Keep it up Carrie!!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Inserting the CD auto invoked the driver wizard - click next, next, next, finish.<br /><br />Plug the unit into any USB port, the OS will map the device to an unused port automatically.<br /><br />Go into Device Manager and then Ports - double click and go to the advanced tab and redirect the port number to the unused port of your choice.<br /><br />Open Hyper Terminal and create a connection to that port.  Short pins 2 $ 3 and type some characters - the display should reflect what you type.<br /><br />Removing the short (paper clip) will result in no characters displaying when typing.<br /><br />That's it - she is good to GO.  Great device!  Easy to install - no headaches.
B00BLON1AK|5.0|High action, unique bike stunts, was lots of fun to watch. Love the Manhattan backdrop where movie takes place.  You'll especially like it if you enjoy fixed-gear bicycling.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever<br />Hugh king of them hhb and money from the same time for pe version of them are a very long time to craft.<br /><br />Job and thrivecfjn to craft of the best games in a class of our movies are a few years old.

B00CL50LEC|5.0|I am a fan of both resident evil and twilight .  I never thought you could have a love story combined with any zombie movie.  I was wrong.  If you like zombie movies and twilight love story you will like this movie.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Fun addictive game slot like bejeweled blitz with a little more flare so if that is your thing you will love it as I do
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I read this book because I liked Blade Runner.  The book is different than the movie.  The book focuses on empathy and and delves into the psychology of human and android.
1878424505|5.0|This book has been one of the Most Important Books I have ever bought. It has brought me Great Contentment and has given me great strength to confront life...Thank you to all involved in its distribution.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Lila
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a most entertaining movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it - especially the interaction between the Julie(ia) and their husbands.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Best movie I have ever seen definitely worth the watch. can't believe there are some people rating this film 1 star. #Morons
B001NLKT60|5.0|Steig Larson was a great writer and I thoroughlt emjoyed this book.  My only regret is that after the next book in the series (Which I will read next) there won't be any more.  The level of research and human insight in Larson's writing is without par.
B000J1AGQI|3.0|This could have been monumental, however, poor production detracts severely from sterling performances and a great story. Yes, Gibson was convincing. as were Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|So far this story has grabbed my attention and kept me very entertained and interested. The characters and writing are well done. Like the way the story is written. Have almost finished the this 1st book in the series.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Yes, this does resemble Miami Vice, but the cinematography and acting make it A+. James Fennimore Cooper might not appreciate how they mangled his story or how it was shot in North Carolina as opposed to Lake George where it all happened.<br />But, all in all- a classic, well worth your time.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I lost my level 45 dragonvale game and got restarted at first level. Not very happy I have spent 8 months playing to lose everything.
0765334798|5.0|If you've ever been a fan of Star Trek you'll like this book. The fanfic portion is hilarious. Scalzi excels at writing witty banter and snappy comebacks, and placing characters in believably ridonkulous situations. His pacing is admirable, you're always being propelled directly into the next exciting event even as the previous one is wrapping up. There's no hang ups, no chance for your mind to wander, yet it's never dizzying. It's hard to put it down, and it's not too long, making this a very fast read. And while the main show is supposedly the novella, the real meat is in the Codas. The writing slows down and a number of rather serious concerns about existential angst are explored by characters struggling to find meaning in their lives. As fun as the fanfic was, these essays really made the book for me, and for everyone who discussed this at our book club.
B005UG542S|4.0|Loved all the Potter films. Adventurous.  good entertainment.  Nice ending.<br />It's too bad there wasn't more filmed when the kids were in their teens.
0765365278|5.0|Pure awesome. Nevermind the great fight scenes, the creepy-as-hell Outsiders intruding into the world, the rich but lost history of gods on earth, and the constant growing sense of doom. All that is great, but what really sets this book apart is its idealization of the human spirit. This is a book of Capital Letter Ideals. Honor. Loyalty. Duty. Empathy. These characters are archetypes of the things we most aspire to be. Unless you have a frigid heart of stone, this story will stir things in you. It's worth the huge page count, you won't even realize how fast the pages are flying by.
B00498YZH8|4.0|I'm a Lawrence Fan.  She is a fantastic actor.<br />It's an eye opener for the type of family lifestyles, loyalty and culture in the remote areas of the country.
B005HSL626|5.0|FUN GAME VERY ADDICTING..MY NIECE LOVES IT, GREAT FOR LONG TRIPS AND SITTING ON BEACH...WORKS GREAT ON MY KINDLE FIRE
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! it was worht the money and really entertaining! this was my second attempt at reading it and im wondering why i stopped the first time! the storyline was amazing and it was so well written. I gave it a 5 out of 5
B003VS0CXS|4.0|Fun movie.  Good to see my own son appreciates it as much as I did when i was kid. Good movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale it's so cool. I'm telling u if u get this game you'll love it just saying dont think twice
0307341577|2.0|I was extremely disappointed by this one.  First- here's my history with Flynn:  I started with her third, \\"Gone Girl,\\" and loved it.  I then skipped to her first, \\"Sharp Objects,\\" and loved it even more; I couldn't believe it was a first novel.  I think Flynn is brilliant- she has a seemingly inexhaustible imagination when it comes to crafting sentences (every page is chock-full of literary gems) and weaving stories together, and the depth she infuses into her characters and their backgrounds reminds me of Stieg Larson (who says mysteries can't be literary?).<br /><br />With that said, I was utterly bored and ultimately furious with this one.  First, I'm fine with darkness (\\"Sharp Objects\\" is definitely dark), but I just felt like this one was needlessly dark and violent and just gross.  There were actually scenes that I skipped, and I do NOT skip pages (for example, there was an animal sacrifice that seemed to go on for ages, and for no apparent reason other than for Flynn to show off her talents in description, which is unnecessary).  Even the pointlessly extreme violence and darkness would have been tolerable though if Flynn would just give us a reason to give a crap about any of her characters.  Unlike a lot of reviewers, I didn't find myself loathing Libby-I thought she was somewhat sympathetic-but I certainly didn't care for her enough to really care about what happened to her (whereas I was very attached to Camille in Sharp Objects, and still felt invested in her even when she did some very loathsome things).  Then there's Ben, whom I think Flynn means for us to care for (or at least to care about whether he's innocent, and to care about him being vindicated if it turns out he is innocent), but I loathed him.  The only person I really liked was Lyle, but he wasn't a main character. The novel just seemed to drag on and on and on, not a page-turned in my view, and maybe it's just me, but I was utterly unsurprised by the ending--I didn't exactly predict it (though I had a general idea), but that's only because by the middle of the book, I had an attitude of \\"whatever, they're all evil, any of them could have done it and I just won't be surprised.\\"<br /><br />Bottom line: I just wanted Flynn to give me a reason to care, about the characters, the plot, something that would compel me to finish other than just for the sake of finishing.  If it weren't for my fondness of Flynn and my habit of finishing even the duds , I'd have dumped this one halfway through.  I'm just glad I read Flynn's other two first so that I know what she's capable of, because if I'd have started with Dark Places, I'd have been done with Flynn.  But, since I read the other two first, I'm willing to overlook this flop and stick with her in the future.<br /><br />So, my advice: skip this one. Definitely read Gone Girl (everyone seems to like that one), and from my view (though I've noticed a lot of mixed reviews), read Sharp Objects.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Its likely that if you are buying the 5th season of Gilmore Girls you already love it, but I will say that you will not be disappointed with this season either.<br />Be prepared to stay up too late and be grumpy all day at work to then go home and stay up too late... again. There is no way around it, I'm giving you fair warning.<br />Enjoy!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The movie starts out a little slow while developing the characters but then picks up and becomes fun to watch. I enjoyed it enough to want to see the next one.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It should let you go in the porn shop and he should get laid a few times and there should be prostitutes
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This movie has lots of twists that keep you guessing right till the end. Definitely worth watching if you are a Holmes fan.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Too much fun.<br /><br />They had this planned all along, of course: release _Elysium_ that wanted to be _Behaviour_/_Release_ but wasn't quite, leading some of us Petheads to worry...but then here's _Electric_ less than a year later, and it's back to the heavyweight jam (TM Scooter).<br /><br />Who else can do this, not just after three decades of doing this, but ever?  May Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe continue to mess with us in the friendliest possible way, balancing the occasional dud (\\"Inside a Dream\\") with a flood of gems (\\"Vocal\\") and, every once in a while, a stunningly good cover (\\"The Last to Die\\").  Bottom line: it's a joyous, funny, moving, heartfelt album, and you should probably buy it if you like that kind of thing.<br /><br />PS. I disagree with anyone who doesn't like either \\"Everything Means Something\\" from _Elysium_ or \\"Shouting in the Evening\\" from this one.  They're both brilliant, so you and I may have to physically fight at some point. I'm pretty sure I can take you.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was just fun from start to finish. The actors seem to embrace and enjoy playing their characters. The movie is fast paced which I always like.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Just wanted to point out to those wondering that this device does indeed work with Kindle Fire HD. Netflix, Youtube, and other features work.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|A good sci-fi horror. Melissa George (Home & Away, 30 Days Of Night) and friends go on a boat trip. There is a storm ahead and they board an ocean liner and that's when the chaos begins. A cleverly shot and edited film. Great acting from the cast. A must see if you enjoy films like DeJa Vu, Frequency, One Missed Call, Final Destination, The Jacket, Back To The Future, Ghost Ship, Groundhog Day, 12:01, Twelve Monkeys. So many twists. I'm selling my copy sometime. Mrkish09 Mrkish2013.
0385341008|5.0|The story of this epistolary novel takes place just after the end of WWII. Juliet Ashton is a London-based writer who used to have a humorous column in the Times under the name of Izzy Bickerstaff.<br /><br />While she is at a loss as what to write next, she receives a letter from a Mr Dawsey Adams in Guernsey, saying he has book that once belonged to her, which he got from the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and could she please tell him more about its author.<br /><br />Juliet's curiosity is piqued by the Society's name and thus they start exchanging mail about literature and life on the island during the war, soon involving Dawsey's neighbours in their correspondence. As letters come and go, Juliet grows fond of her new friends and after a few months, she decides to travel to the Channel Islands and meet them in person.<br /><br />This book was offered to me by my father-in-law, who knows I usually only read Fantasy. However, he was spot on! This is indeed an exciting novel full of charming people. I wish I could go on reading about them, and I would love to see a film!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Typical 'boy band' style writing. The story is so unbelievable and you can recognize that the author is making it up as she is going along. I am tired of these generic books, typical of the Grey series without the porn.
B008OHV5W8|5.0|I play this every morning when doing my brief yoga to start my day. I can see this being a great help to falling asleep also Love it!
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|It was well acted and produced.  I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in this type of movie.
B000001ESF|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1977 and 2112 is a must to understand the complexity and sophistication of this band.  I still am amazed that three guys can produce this kind of sound.  Saw them in 1978 in Tampa, Florida and have been hooked ever since.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|For sheer scale of the finishing story, I have found nothing that compares. This book grips the reader and thrusts them into a world where anything and everything is possible. It swings you from humor, to drama, to outright painful loss as fast as you can keep up, where you watch as notable and favorite characters from both sides come to terms with victory and defeat. A must read for anyone, but especially required for those who have braved and mastered the other books in the series that lead up to this momentous Last Battle.
B00BHWG0HW|5.0|Bought this for my grown son for his birthday.  He loves the product and believes this was their best year of production.
1936891026|3.0|His book - though well intended - is really just quotes and stories relating to the trouble with writing. If you're looking for something to help you in  a real-world way this book won't do it for you. It's more of an example of: If you put together enough thoughts and already have a publisher, you can get a book published.
B009GX6600|5.0|The show is very interesting. Like CSI but better because of the comedy. The characters are diverse but fit well together.
B005544V6A|5.0|If you wanted to be a lawyer this is the reason why.  Great show, loved the cast.  Looking forward to Season #2.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a perfect little app. Use a calculator several times a day at work and find myself grabbing my phone to use this app instead of my calculator.<br /><br />Also, when I downloaded this app I downloaded several similar ones in order to compare and keep the best.<br /><br />This is the one I kept.  :)
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am up to date every moment with news and friends. I Kindle is part of me now so to have the news in here is just great.
0061122416|4.0|I read this book because it is a favorite of a girl I started dating. I enjoyed it. It was motivational and thought provoking.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|But greatest to have it in my kindle. I really enjoy It challenges me all the time and you never wanto to stop from playing it.
0007526024|4.0|rich in detail, engaging story of immigrant issues, the hard decision to stay, or go home. at times seemed in danger of entering the chick-lit genre, the protagonist always more of an emotional presence than a physical one...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a really great critical. thinking game! my daughter. and I loved trying to figure it out together. ad loom forward to new rooms!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I was skeptical of this book at first but it reminded me of the writings of robin Gibb in the farseer trilogy. The book is written in an second person but it does so eloquently. The characters and plot leave you guessing the whole time. Very good read and hoping for a sequel soon.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I downloaded this in hopes that it would help me with the levels I've been stuck on. It's not a bad app, but it's more for the advanced player than for someone who can't get past level 63. The app starts off with level 400-something, which at this point, I don't even know if I'm going to make it to 100, let alone 400. I'm sure it's helpful to someone out there. Just not me.
B003QSLW0K|3.0|Probably not the most suitable for young kids, but would be great for older children (7+?). Some violence and awkward questions.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this on my Kindle and my phone. I put notes on the calendar and use it over the calendar on my phone. Also use it for general notes, color coding them.  Does exactly what I want and best of all it's free
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Oh my gosh I loved this book. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but wow this books really sits with you after you are done. Hard to put down. Read it now!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I usaly don't enjoy theese tiypes of games. But this one is pretty fun I was surprised at how fast it was alittle fast but I like it....
B00CW665VI|5.0|If you want to laugh and get into a man's psyche, this is the book for you. Very enjoyable. Happy reading!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids play this game all the time. would give it a 54 if I could great app all for kids
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written. A wonderful story. Excellent winter. His books are treasures to read. Thanks. Can't wait for his next book.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was looking for a combo cover for my Kindle Fire; one that would stand as well as provide protection while in transit. This product doe both. It is well constructed and looks like it will serve it purpose for quite a while.
0071373586|4.0|In our overcommunicated society, the name of the game is to form an image of the product you are selling in the customer's mind. When a product does not sell, the problem is almost always the perception of the product, or lack of an independent identity of the product in the buyers' minds, not the product itself.<br /><br />People buy according to what they expect. As an example, blind taste tests often rank cheap, little-known wines ahead of prestigious French wines.<br /><br />Trademarks such as Mr. Clean exist to form an image in the customer's mind. To dilute such trademarks is known as the line-extension trap. For instance, to the customer, Levi's means jeans. It was a mistake to expand the line to cover footwear, so-called \\"Levi's for feet\\".<br /><br />The only way to dislodge a leading product is to reposition the product in the customer's mind. Consider the institution of aspirin. The only way for the makers of synthetic pain relievers to beat aspirin was to reposition it with the phrase, \\"For the millions who should not take aspirin.\\" It worked.
B00AFARIZA|5.0|I've made it a point to own these recordings since the LP days of the 60s.  Of course, they're excellent, and anyone who wishes to gain a more complete picture of the Maestro should collect as many of his earlier recordings as they can find, even if the recorded \\"sound\\" can only charitably be described as \\"historic.\\"  It should be mentioned that, at the time these HMV recordings were made, the great French horn virtuoso Dennis Brain was the leader of the BBCSO horn section.  That must have been a dream come true for Toscanini, and there are times here when the horn section seems to exhibit (dare I say it?) almost *too much* personality!  This is a set that should be in everybody's collection if they have an interest in Maestro Toscanini's contribution to the art of orchestral playing.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|best current album in my collection. both the quality of songwriting and recording are superior. I was kind'of getting sick of today's indie-rock and the whole &#34;recorded poorly 'cause it's cool&#34; thing. This brought me back to actually listening to the music.
B002QFYJF4|4.0|this movie is one of Tom Cruise's better movies!! excellent movie! engrossing, good plot, well acted, all in all a great movie!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can be campy at moments but Maggie Smith's character keeps you entertained. Lord Grantham is slowly evolving with the modern times. Will Lady Edith have her moment to shine?
1401311083|5.0|Thank You for this great book, and I am looking for all his books-Your help would be appreciated.<br />THANK YOU<br />Basil
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun without thinking too much.  Just hard enough to keep you interested. Can't wait for more levels to be created
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is the most amazing game ever. I have all the hungry shark games and this one is the best one. I'm also addicted to this game. if I was slinky I would so marry this game.lol I'm in luv
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As I said, excellent entertainment.  I'm looking forward to season 4.  I didn't like losing a main beloved character but that is life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is just that solitaire. However the graphics are out standing but no extra bells &amp; whistles which I love. Just good ole fashioned Solitaire.
B009AVCAJ4|4.0|Its Fooking ninjascroll! looks great, sounds great. the aspect ratio kindof pisses me off though on my widescreen tv.. had to fiddle a bit to not get a goofy little video in the middle of my tv and that is my only gripe.
B00AEBB8FQ|5.0|This movie is amazingly funny. None stop laughs from beginning to end. Ben Stiller, Robert Downy Jr, and Jack black at there funniest!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The characters are believable, the plot is intriguing, and the time period information is interesting. The show will drag you in and you can't stop watching until it is over.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty good puzzler. Had to go to youtube once to get a clue. Once means it was hard but not too hard. Fun but way too short. Only ten levels.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I got hooked on this book reading the first pages, in the look inside \\"demo\\". The main idea is  very good. The science part interesting. I thought it would be an attention gripping book as The Sphere or other Michael Crichton books ( not that  I have read all his books, only about 3). I found the story was diluted by too many and too long sidetracks produced by many breaks in the main story, in my opinion this impairs continuity. Sometimes I read a book in \\"one sitting\\", not this one.<br /><br />I repeat - it is my first Sigma book then I can't compare to other Sigma books. For this reason I cannot recommend to get or not this book to Sigma followers.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not much of a TV watcher, but agreed to watch this series w/my best friend. The writing is simply incredible! I can't wait for the next season. It's like watching a good book. Beautiful!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game that gets harder each level. No good directions, though-i had to figure out out as I went. Fun to play, just wish there were more levels
0812993845|5.0|I love this book and can't wait to see what happens! I haven't been able to put this book down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The card movement is easy and the graphics are good.  Although the popup ads are somewhat frequent they are easy to skip and don't really interfere with game enjoyment.  If you like to play solitaire this is a good product.
B001TM14VC|5.0|When you talk about the most exciting, most influential, most widely-seen, most widely recognized, most ingrained into pop culture, most quoted, and most cherished films of the 1980s, Top Gun is one of only a few that fit every single one of those talking points. While I believe Arnold Schwarzenegger's Commando to be the quintessential 1980s action movie, I concede that Tom Cruise's Top Gun is perhaps the most decade-defining film, period. The film embodied everything 1980s: the &#34;need for speed,&#34; an incredibly successful soundtrack that epitomized 1980s music, and served as a showcase of American aerial might and superiority as the Cold War drew to a close. Top Gun also paved the way for Tom Cruise to become one of the hottest and most widely-recognized stars Hollywood has ever seen, action or otherwise. With its death-defying aerial stunts, memorable characters, quotable moments, high-flying soundtrack, and plenty of first-rate action, Top Gun remains one of the most popular films even today, some 22 years after its initial release to theaters.<br />Edit Review Delete Review<br />You wrote this on 3/20/12
B0027VTMAE|5.0|johnny depp is amazing in this movie. great acting, storyline and plot. very intense and i would definetly recommend it.
0553384775|2.0|This book starts out like it's gonna be a really good story, but then the narrator starts going off on tangents that are non-essential to the story and it goes off the rails. By the page 350 (150 pages left), I just wanted it to end. Much of the story repeats itself (tons of drug use, Jordan thinking he's better than everyone) after the initial introduction. You keep waiting for a major event to shift the story and give it purpose, but it never happens.<br /><br />Jordan Belfort has a very limited vocabulary, as evidenced by his constant go-to word: \\"Loins\\". That word is mentioned at least 50 times...in the first 250 pages. This book was a bad read written by a narcissist, however it will make for a good movie because excess is much better portrayed in film and won't seem as repetitive when Marty Scorcese tells this story.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This is a good series. It is instructive and deliveres a positive social message of understanding and treating each other with dignity and respect. No wonder the U.S. Department of Education endorsed it.<br /><br />The first episodes are a little bit rough around the edges. But once the crew of the Enterprice get their act together, this actors blend it very well and deliver a fantastic series. Just a few reasons when I think this series has been so popular, despite its age.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. It is sad and adventurous. Get this book it is the best book ever
B00CHRB9RM|4.0|&#34;Hittin' the Note&#34; magazine had a big article about this set before it came out. I already pre-ordered it so the mag helped fuel the fire of anticipation. I was not disappointed to say the least. The outtakes and rehearsal cd was rather dull, almost like going thru the motions. That's the only somewhat negative to a great, historical set. But to hear it gives a listener a sense of the struggles the band was going thru . As for the live stuff- oh, my word! Sometimes I personally do not care for Greg Allman's singing when he sounds &#34;lazy&#34; or &#34;tired&#34; or worst. Not on this stuff!! He sounds GREAT! Singing like he means it-oh yea! Lamar Williams plays &#34;bottomy&#34; bass, not in the upper registers yet so inventive. The interplay between Dickie Betts and Chuck Leavell makes it a way different band than before, obviously. A great remix for the original album of &#34;Brothers & Sisters&#34; brings out a lot. The Allman Brothers live, both on cd or seeing them in person,is what musicians should strive for.This cd set is another example of why they deserve their reputation of being one of the best acts in music history.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This arrives exactly as promised. Love this show & I really thought I wouldn't since I hate blood & don't really like crime dramas. But I am a fan of Dexter! It's got a great story line & yes, I find myself &#34;rooting&#34; for Dexter when he goes after the true bad guys!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the puzzles but it needs to be longer.  I've played it through a number of times and am still enjoying it. Please make more soon.
B0091REZMW|3.0|An easy game that helps pass the time, not challenging and a bit repetetive. Also need to purchase things with real money which is annoying.
B00932A4XE|4.0|This prob. Would not have been as funny if we didn't just become parents. Cute movie would recommend to others
B00CLMA3HK|4.0|This is a book that enabled me to experience the magical mayhem of other worlds, I discovered wonderful characters and creations, and enjoy a storyline that was refreshing and direct. Jesse is on a mission to discover what happened to her mother. Jesse has been brought up by her older brother, and both of them are scarred by the loss of their mother. Each of them dealing with the mystery in their own way. When Jesse, with the help of dreams and instinct, begins to put the clues together, we, the reader are taken on a journey that spans more than one world. I enjoyed the relationships between the characters, and was caught up in the conflict. I cared about my favourite character, (which happened to be Marcus!) and couldn't put the book down until I'd found out what happened to him. Great work.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Three nights in a row I was up until 3am to read what would happen next. This story, while not a thrill ride, was like a great conversation that I didn't want to end.

0937381888|5.0|This was my assigned textbook for a brewing class in college that we got to pass by calling it &#34;Applied Microbiology.&#34;  It is a great read full of useful information and great tips and offers everything you would need from the new extract brewer to all-grain and brew-in-a-bag.<br /><br />For the cheap price this thing was great, I bought the paper version instead of the electronic one so I could have it on-hand and write notes in it for myself.  This was a great idea and has proved very handy especially when I lend it to friends.<br /><br />Best resource I could find.

B00A757EFW|2.0|good game when I was young 30 years ago and could handle the stress. this game lets you know very quick how fast you have aged.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show started strong, and has only continued to grow throughout the second season. A mix of light and heavier fare makes this easy to watch, easy to fall in love with, and easy to stick with. Also, Gabriel Macht in a suit is worth an hour of anyone's time.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's worth watching! Saw it at a drive-in and was sorry I didn't take my son but I expected it to be less family friendly then.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife got me into this show and it's great!  The storyline, acting and cinematography are very well done.  Looking forward to season 4!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This series continues to satisfy.  Everything from the cast, to costumes, to the writing, to directing, and any other element of good television drama you can come up with - is all done with complete EXCELLENCE!  One episode, and you will be hooked.<br /><br />Can not wait for season 4!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Had this plugged in for a few hours so far, and love it!  Plugged it into the HDMI and USB (for power) on my TV, switched to that input and it fired right up!  Used my phone to quickly configure it and go!  So far zero issues.  Streams YouTube well from my phone, tablet and desktop.  Right now streaming some Music from my tablet, and no issues.  It is nice enough to move the album art around the TV about every 20 seconds to prevent burn.<br /><br />I am using the extender right now, but may remove it.  I believe I have enough room.<br /><br />A note to people: You have to use a wireless device with the Chromecast application to do the initial setup.  That is a WIRELESS device!  When you do the initial setup it seems to do a point-to-point wireless connection to the Chromecast device so that you can join your home wireless network.<br /><br />Overall, from unboxing to using, took me less than 5 minutes.  Chromecast doesn't seem to support the 5GHz wireless spectrum, so I had to join it to my 2.4GHz network.  Not a huge issue, but be warned if you try to connect to your 5GHz wireless network.<br /><br />Another tip: make sure to install the &#34;Google Cast&#34; extension for Chrome on your computers and the &#34;Chromecast&#34; app on your mobile device.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|This is among my favorites of John Wayne movies.  Liked the ensemble acting between Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and John Wayne.  The supporting actors were great too.  Is a movie I can watch over and over.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Several favorites on this album - the play was awesome and now it's great to have the music, so I can listen whenever I want
0385738765|3.0|The Good: The goals of WICKED remain undecipherable. What they want the kids for, what the desired end result of the testing is, all of the \\"whys\\" are unfathomable. Somehow, James Dashner continues to weave a tale in which the reader has no understand of the past, future or even the present and he makes it an enjoyable experience nonetheless.<br /><br />The Bad: I strongly dislike \\"on the run\\" novels, especially when situated as the second book in a series. That's basically what the second trial is, getting from point A to point B alive and within the set time period. While other things happen along the way to clue readers in on how things arrived at this point and move along the characters personal relationships, for the most part the book is constant movement.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just cant figure out how to get past level 6 for some reason.. with the pyramid number thing. idk what the numbers would be.
B00B4804MQ|5.0|I enjoy this movie because there are not a lot of car guy movies out there. The movie has great action!  Even more importantly  the movie has a lot of cool cars in. It is not a good movie for everyone who wants everything to be perfectly realistic but fun to watch nonetheless.
B00AXVHHTI|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best dramas hands down on TV in years!  Story lines are wonderful, great acting and visually superior to most things you see now days.<br />I have watched all three seasons between here and Hulu Plus in about 6 weeks or so.  Very sad to know that it will not be returning to American TV until January.  As I do not have cable, it may be next summer before I can watch Season 4.  :(

B005544TRQ|5.0|I like this show for its wit and humor.  Fun show and look forward to seeing the next episode. one.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|well i can tell that the very concept of this book has set off a review firestorm just by looking at all the one star reviews crying that the author is a.......wait for it....MUSLIM!!! actually the author grew up loving the christian religion and he began his historical journey in to jesus' life while he was in college just trying to learn as much as he could about him. so if you want to review the book, actually read it, because its very good. if, however, you want to merely throw around insults, save it for the websites you troll.
0425263991|5.0|Twelfth in the Psy-Changeling paranormal romance series revolving around the shifters in the DarkRiver and SnowDancer packs just outside San Francisco although the primary location in this story is Moscow. The couple focus is on Kaleb Krycheck (!) and the woman he's been hunting for years, Sahara Kyriakus.<br /><br />You really want to have read the previous stories, if only so you fully understand how terrifying Kaleb Krychek is.<br /><br />My Take<br />Oh, this one is so romantic. In a terrifying way! And so very emotional. Totally unexpected considering that it's about two Psy who were raised in Silence. Singh makes a great argument as to why Silence is wrong, and I do have to wonder how a brilliant man like Krycheck can be so obtuse about his own emotions. He's obsessed with Sahara and will do anything to protect her. She arouses him...which is a pretty emotional reaction. I must confess I'm just dying to read on to the next and the next in the series if only to read the reactions of other Psy when they discover how much of the wonder of life they've been missing out on.<br /><br />Singh is brilliant in stretching out our ignorance, dropping small clues here and there, just enough to titillate and confuse as she herds us along in one direction. She pulls at my own emotions, and I cried for these two damaged people. I loved how Singh had Krychek so full of guilt (so unexpected), and how he expressed it. Beautifully done. I already want to re-read it! Yep, I re-read it...<br /><br />Great tension...<br /><br />Part of what is so very fascinating about Heart of Obsidian is the almost robot-like reactions and honesty of both protagonists. Well, with each other, they are honest and forthright. As much as Krychek wants to lie to keep Sahara at his side, he realizes he would lose her in the end by doing so, and you can feel him hunching over inside, cringing as he waits for her to abandon him. As for Sahara, reading through her fears of what he's done, knowing that he had something to do with her imprisonment, realizing the various possible interpretations on why he reacts and treats her as he does, and yet she still holds true---it's amazing.<br /><br />Singh slips back and forth from current time to the past providing us with a ringside seat to Krychek and Sahara's meetings as children and his treatment and training by Santano. I do think Krychek protests too much about his lack of empathy. His Silence is broken after all, and his strength of mind would enable him to convince himself of anything.<br /><br />It did answer my one suspicion when I learned who the mysterious figure, Ghost, is who has been appearing randomly throughout the series.<br /><br />For such intelligent people, you'd'a think they'd'a thought of this!<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch two Psy break down. It's always been a Psy and a shifter in the past with that clash of culture between one group that requires a cold nature \\"versus\\" another group that strongly believes in touch. Instead, we have two Psy who are both starved for touch, and oh, man, it gets literal when Kaleb rocks her world...!<br /><br />Ha! I love it!! Vasquez is not getting the response he wants from his terrorist attacks. What an idiot! He's so clueless and isn't even aware that his own Silence is fractured. Besides, isn't the fact that Pure Psy is so passionate about maintaining Silence an emotion?<br /><br />I liked the letters to the editor that Singh distributes throughout this story. An interesting back-and-forth from Psy arguing for and against Silence. Some of 'em I just wanna smack!<br /><br />Krychek is the one who lifted the train off Annie (see [[ASIN:0425223558 The Magical Christmas Cat]]: Stroke of Enticement, 3.5).<br /><br />The Story<br />The bright and shining hope of Silence is shattered as those with power realize that while the Psy leaders are the cream of their race, they are also psychopaths.<br /><br />And Kaleb Krychek has found the one for whom he has been searching. The one for whom he would destroy the world. The one with no memory of her past. No memory of Kaleb. The question is, is her mind already destroyed and past all hope?<br /><br />The Characters<br />Too young when kidnapped and tortured, Sahara Kyriakus of the PsyClan NightStar created her own protection in her mind. She's not Silent, but she has passed. Leon Kyriakus is her father; Daniela Garc&iacute;a is her mother. Anthony Kyriakus, the head of the NightStar Clan, is her uncle. Faith is her cousin, and she's mated to Vaughn of the DarkRiver pack.<br /><br />Kaleb Krychek is a deadly dual cardinal: telekinetic and a teleporter; he has been searching for one person for years. Silver Mercant has been his aide for years. Krychek's parents sold him when he was a child back to Santano Enrique, a brutally psychopathic councilor who could also function as an anchor (see [[ASIN:0425212866 Slave to Sensation (Psy-Changelings, #1)]]). He was raised and taught, using brutally efficient methods; he was forced to watch, participate in Santano's crimes against women.<br /><br />Aden currently leads the Arrow Squad, covert Psy operatives highly trained and dangerous. Vasic, who has volunteered to be implanted with a test computronic gauntlet, and Judd Lauren ([[ASIN:0425218422 Caressed By Ice (Psy-Changelings, #3)]]), a Tk-V, are fellow operatives.<br /><br />Father Xavier Perez is one of three working to bring down Silence. Nina is a woman whom Perez loved, and Judd gave him the information to find her.<br /><br />Nikita Duncan and Anthony Kyriakus are the Psy Councilors who live in the area claimed by DarkRiver and SnowDancer. Max Shannon is Nikita's chief of security; his wife, Sophia, is an ex-J with her own extensive contacts. Other councilors include Ming, Tatiana Rika-Smythe, and a very quiet Shoshanna Scott. David Sezer is one of Tatiana's people, bright but cruel.<br /><br />Mercy is pregnant with her pupcubs. Lucas Hunter is the alpha for the DarkRiver leopards. Nathan Ryder is DarkRiver's most senior lieutenant. Hawke is the alpha for SnowDancer wolves. Teijan is the Rats alpha and head of the best spy organization in the region. Adam Garrett is the alpha of the WindHaven falcons. Drew is one of the trackers looking for traces of the terrorists' attack.<br /><br />Jim Wong is the representative of the shopkeepers in Chinatown.<br /><br />Andrea Vasquez is the current leader of Pure Psy since Councilor Henry Scott's death.<br /><br />Silence. Protocol, a state by which all emotion is conditioned out of a person. A concept proven by Adelajas. Pure Psy is a radical pro-Silence group, which intends to terrorize the Psy back into Silence. Anchors are a specific type of Psy who are able to hold the Net in place. The PsyNet is a psychic network which helps hold together the Psy, providing them with the biofeedback necessary to keep them sane. It's a health that is splintering, dying in pieces. The NetMind, equal to an innocent child, and the DarkMind, similar to an ignored and abused child, are twin entities which reflect the health of the PsyNet and have been Krychek's only friends for too long.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is so perfect when you realize the story. A lone man stalking in the rain to the top of a hill on the streets of San Francisco. Just over that hill is a blaze of golden light---the perfect metaphor as this tormented and lonely, desperate man is about to find his Holy Grail.<br /><br />The title is also perfect and not what you think!

B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A beautiful, funny, touching film about our bodies get old but our spirits stay young. Billy Kennedy makes the movie.
1590171993|5.0|A fictional biography of an English literature professor who tried.<br /><br />My Take<br />I have to agree with Steve Almond's assessment of Stoner. Williams does treat his characters with brutal honesty, and it's a story that is so incredibly depressing. A life that is not so much lived as endured. It is a life that is a series of disappointments, that makes one question why one must live at all. Except for one brief period of actual joy in his life before it's torn from him by an enemy.<br /><br />Williams does write beautifully, if depressingly:<br />\\"Her needlepoint was delicate and useless, she painted misty landscapes of thin water-color washes, and she played the piano with a forceless but precise hand...\\"<br /><br />I do commend Stoner for the stance he takes on Walker, and I can't believe Lomax was allowed to get away with this...I'm astonished. And, even more depressed. I do love the steps Stoner finally takes to readjust his schedule.<br /><br />\\"He realized it was the first time [in five years] anyone had spoken his name since he had come there.\\"<br /><br />Stoner is a decent man who deserved so much better. And the best he received is in Williams' writing of him.<br /><br />Williams' depiction of the time period and the intra-departmental politics was very well done. It certainly brought home to me how very lucky we are to be living now with the relaxed manners of today and our acceptance of mental health---although I'm not sure it would have done any good if Williams had set Stoner in today. Perhaps it might have allowed for a change in Will and Edith's circumstances, perhaps greater education would have saved them both.<br /><br />Yes, if you are a writer or simply appreciate excellent writing, I do recommend Stoner. However, be aware that it's so incredibly depressing that it may be difficult to read. God knows it took me five weeks to get through this...and mostly because I'm stubborn and wanted to understand why, suddenly, Stoner was being promoted everywhere as such a good read.<br /><br />The Story<br />It's a life like most. An unexpected opportunity results in a switch of Will Stoner's aim in life, and he becomes a teacher of English literature at the university in Columbia.<br /><br />War breaks out and the inevitable indecisions arise with life proceeding along. It's after the war that Will meets Edith in an awkward courtship which leads to an horrific marriage. And on down, down, and down.<br /><br />The Characters<br />The son of an impoverished farmer and his wife, William Stoner is sent off to University with hopes of what Will can learn at the College of Agriculture. Jim Foote is his mother's cousin and has a farm where Will works for his room and board. Edith Elaine Bostwick is the daughter of a well-to-do family in St. Louis with an interest in the arts. Emma Darley is Edith's aunt. Horace and Mrs. Bostwick are Edith's parents. Grace is Will and Edith's daughter, committing a slow suicide. Ed Frye is the man Grace marries.<br /><br />Professor Archer Sloane arranges for Will to teach at the school, and war creates its own demands. David Masters and Gordon Finch are schoolmates and acting instructors in the department with whom he becomes friendly. Caroline Wingate is the girl whom Finch marries. Josiah Claremont is the dean of Arts and Sciences. Hollis Lomax and Jim Holland are a couple of the professors; Rutherford is dean of the Graduate College. Professor Joel Erhardt arrives later to the department. Dr. Jamison works for the University.<br /><br />Katherine Driscoll audits the class in which Walker is the fool; she is an instructor in the English department while she writes her dissertation. Charles Walker is a pet student of Lomax's. I do wish we had eventually learned the why of it.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is grim with its mustardy yellow background and Will Stoner, hands in the pockets of his ill-fitting suit, contemplating his life.<br /><br />The title is the man about whomwe'll read, Stoner.we'll read, Stoner.
B00AW57L96|2.0|I had trouble getting interested in this book right from the start. I did try to give it a go and made it to nearly half way through, but found it hard to follow the storyline. Maybe it was just me as I have not read any books from this author in the past. Sorry, but I just couldn't continue with it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I really likes how fun it was when I finally started playing because it is somewhat different from all the other games similir to that (temple run &amp; angry gran run ect) but it took a whole load of time to load.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I never appreciated Kanye West until well after he went nutty and busted in on Taylor Swift's awards acceptance speech.  So, I won't be comparing \\"Yeezus\\" to Kanye's back catalog.  And I won't be coming at this from the perspective of a hip hop connoisseur.  I will, however, be coming at this from a music enthusiast who appreciates artistic risks.<br /><br />I've listened through \\"Yeezus\\" in its entirety at least half a dozen times and I just can't get enough.  It wasn't until this last time through that it clicked for me, \\"Why?\\"  To me, \\"Yeezus\\" is to Kanye as \\"Kid A\\" was to Radiohead back in 2000.  You had an established artist with a huge fan base that decided to take an artistic risk and ended up with a masterpiece.  Kelly Clarkson's \\"My December\\" and Fiona Apple's \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" also came to mind (though I'm harder pressed to call those masterpieces).  The arguable commonality across all of these albums is that none of them seem to have an obvious hit single, yet they all hold together extremely well as complete works.<br /><br />The droning beats and experimental sounds of \\"Yeezus\\" generally appeal to the part of my brain that loves Bauhaus, Joy Division, and Portishead much more than the part of my brain that loves Jay-Z.  I can totally understand why long-time Kanye fans and top 40 listeners would be confused and dissatisfied.  But for me, it's quite possibly my favorite album of the last five years.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Wonderful acting, great sets, amazing costumes.  Wish they had shown Catherine of Aragon as a redhead, which she was in real life, but the actress, Ms. Doyle I believe, was excellent as Catherine.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers really brings King Henry to life.  Henry Cavill as Lord Suffolk was of course excellent.  Natalie Dormer was unforgettable as Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />This movie is not for children, or even teenagers, because of the gruesome torture scenes.  They are beyond R-rated.  Not for pregnant women.  I had to turn off the sound and look away.  These scenes could have been cut much shorter, and less detailed, and still would have conveyed the horror of those times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game!! I love all the antics of the Minions. It keeps me smiling. Great way to pass time when I have to be waiting around.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|A beautifully written story that takes you into the lives of many characters. Expresses the value of family and the tragedy that occurs when one is broken apart. You can easily picture this story repeating itself in many war or impoverish countries.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Stupid, boring, can't believe I spend $ on this trash.  That was the point of the author, to make money.
0670024813|3.0|The world until yesterday is Jared Diamond's (author of Guns Germs and Steel and Collapse) latest book.  The book is an account of how tribal communities function and how they construct the fabric of their society and how their constructions, from the author's point of view, can give us valuable insight into improving aspects of modern society.  The book is split into 5 parts and includes concepts of community, war, age and dependency, danger within the habitat, religion, language and dietary health.  The book is very personal and less of a thesis driven book as much as its an introspective account of the author's life and broad lessons that he has learned.  It is interesting and informative but it lacks the academic weight of his previous works.<br /><br />The first of the five sections focuses on how space is divided in traditional society.  The boundaries are much more distinct in tribal society than it is in our porous modern day civilization in which citizens can for the most part freely explore their nations lands.  The dangers in crossing  into the unfamiliar as well as hostile are detailed through specific personal experiences in the author's travels.  The author discusses the differences in trading patterns in traditional society versus modern, in which the former do not specifically trade for comparative advantage and are driven by a broader set of goals and dependencies.<br /><br />The author then moves into the space of justice and areas of war.  In modern society the author notes how civil and criminal justice works and the point of the institutional arrangement.  Criminal justice is not about the victims seeking justice it is about the state seeking justice on behalf of civil society.  The civil justice system which addresses tort and contract law deals with commercial issues but the formality of it is shown to be very different from conflict resolution in tribal society.  The author uses specific stories from his history to detail how conflict resolution works in some tribes and how it can bring much more closure to the parties involved.  The author then gives some prescriptive advice about how arbitration and face to face emotional correspondence could potentially be far less costly and more fulfilling for parties involved.  The author then moves on to war and how the duration and alliances and death rates are very different in tribal society.  The participation rates of tribal society are much higher and the rules of war much different.  Though the number of lives is much smaller when comparing tribal war to national wars, the percentages of the population affected are much greater.  This sort of narrative is frankly obvious and the ideas about how war is much more deadly for the average tribal member vs member of society is trivial for most people I could imagine reading this sort of book. The differences between how and why society goes to war is discussed and in particular the attitudes of modern society vs tribal society about war is discussed.<br /><br />The author discusses the different approaches tribal society has for its young and old people.  There is no consistency in the various examples used; in some society the elderly are cherished and in the others they are burdens which can be left to die by themselves.  The author shows that tribes usually have clear cultural reasons for the differences.  He discusses modern society and how their attitudes differ as well, distinguishing Confucian and Western philosophies on their elderly for example.  The author brings up the idea of greater inclusiveness of the elderly in taking care of grandchildren in the West.  These are interesting points and are policies that will keep many families in better balance but it is often hard to understand where the book is going.  Cultural lessons like this, though i agree with them, sometimes seem misplaced and the personal longings of the author come through instead of a concrete message.<br /><br />The author discusseshow our experience shapes our apprehension in different circumstances.  People from tribal society brought into modern society can be extremely fearful of cars and crossing the road and our background in understanding risk shapes our perspective on risks worth taking.  The author includes a story of what seems like a very dangerous situation in Indonesia with a capsized canoe.  The author is in a situation in which he feels like he might have almost died due to the carelessness of youthful and irresponsible boatmen and at the end of the experience when he is safe, he discusses the episode with a native who replies back that he had avoided the boat because he knew the waters can be choppy and this boat crew looked cavalier.  The moral of the story is that the risks to the journey could be seen by people who live with those risks but are overlooked by those who don't who assume the expertise of others.  The author also discusses other traditional risks in society, disease, starvation and violence.  The author discusses how diversification of land holdings though ineffective from personal energy utilization improves survival through the benefits of diversifying the randomness of weather.  It then is discussed how modern solutions have overlooked the benefit evolutionary solutions and the evolutionary solutions work for a reason and improve survivability.  Honestly parts of the book like this can be quite frustrating as anyone rational would agree, but the modern solution would also say that if one evolved a monetary economy then it is more efficient to consolidate and have a savings system to smooth the variation in weather on your better maintained concentrated plot.  If you can have a better aggregate yield by consolidating and use a better trading system to distribute that yield then that is the better solution.  Often the benefits of tribal solutions are just descriptions of how when people don't coordinate, diversification is better.  That is not a good lesson totry to share, its a scary one.<br /><br />The book goes on to discuss Religion Language and Health, this is the final part of the book.  Much is covered in this chapter, but nothing particularly completely.  Evolution is discussed and how the electric eel cant be used as a counterexample of Darwinism (it is used as an example because its electric charge is a large quantum above the next creature and the incrementalism of Darwin would question how this evolved).  One later discovers this is used because it was the author's dissertation.  It discusses the role of religion and how it has evolved.  One valuable insight given is that people who pray feel less anxiety about that which they cannot control than those who don't.  Hence it fills a psychological role for people.  Much has been written recently on this subject and this is not particularly strong, for better content and origins of human religions and moral code read [[ASIN:B007Q6XKEY The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates]].  The contents of the chapter are a combination of political institution building and moral philosophy.  The author moves on to language and describes how being multilingual can deter Alzheimer's.  In particular people who are bi/multi lingual are better at reasoning in a changing environment, apparently because the need to always choose words from a larger word choice set instills a background mental discipline that keeps us sharp.  That is an interesting fact.  That fact alone does not really argue the author's broader point about language and that 7000 languages is variety to be cherished (which i am not for or against just the argument and the conclusion are not along the same line of thought).  Finally the author describes diet and how modern diets have brought upon elevated hypertension and diabetes.  This dietary science is pretty well documented and the prescription is good (watch your exercise and your diet).  Tribal diets and daily routines don't lead to these diseases and hence if we force ourselves to be better balanced we can improve our health and decrease our likelihood to suffer these diseases.<br /><br />The stories of experience within tribal society are insightful and one gets a good sense of how different tribes live and solve problems.  The messages in the book are mixed and more philosophical then a function of the tribal lessons.  Though the author tries to draw parallels they are done in ways that are unconvincing and self selected.  I do think the author has good ideas about the ways we can improve our lives and taking lessons from a lifestyle most of us have long forgotten but this is not an academic text so much as its a personal history that is sprinkled with personal philosophy.  I am glad i read this, but this is a far cry in terms of ideas presented from Guns Germs and Steel and I'm not sure it really fulfills the author's goals of showing what we can learn from traditional society.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I was already fan of this movie. My wife and kid also liked it very much.<br />Excellent graphics, good story, good dialogues
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great app!! Very fun, and has a very addicting twist. After a while it gets hard to put down! I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys Temple Run or Subway Suffers.
B00005U122|5.0|A must have for any fan of Pink Floyd, Roger like the rest of the band is one of a kind. :)
0345803485|1.0|I read it. And when I say that, I mean I read start to finish, but I could not stand to read every word. The prose are so repetitive, the author glorifies what isn't romantic and attempts to make it romantic (fails), and the inner-thoughts of the main character are asinine. I am at once completely incredulous that a nearly 50 yr old woman wrote the book and at once believing. I mean, she wrote a book I can imagine my mom bringing with her on a summer vacation to the beach. Yet, I cannot imagine a 50 yr old woman constructing such shallow characters and implying that they're somehow deep and pining and damaged. Well, they are damaged, but in the most lazy ways.<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, but really, ladies, stop giving this book a high rating simply because it turned you on. There is a reason the Oscars do not have a pornography award. Porn does what it is supposed to for a lot of people, but it is never mistaken for art. This book isn't artistic. It's fluff. It's something you read when you're frustrated or bored or unable to commit to something with substance. It's easy like Sunday morning, and that's all it has going for it.<br /><br />If you want to read about characters with depth, go read Jane Eyre. Don't pretend this compares to that sort of book just to justify the fact that you have just indulged in porn. No one is asking you to justify it. It's ok. You're grandma isn't turning in her grave. She's dead. She cannot turn. And if you want to read erotic novels, I'm sure that there are well-written ones out there. Go read them and compare the two. You'll find that this one isn't approaching the genius rating of 5 stars many here have given it.<br /><br />Basically, I need the ratio of 5 stars to 1 stars to shift in favor of the 1's because I am slightly ashamed of being of the female race. Is it irrational of me to judge us all for the Amazon ratings? Yes. I know that women liking the book are possibly more likely to come on here to defend it. Or at least,those with strong opinions either way, and those who indulge in romance novels more are more likely to read this in the first place than people who do not. And I know I am guilty of having read it just like you, out of some morbid curiosity I kept going, hoping that the characters would drive me more than the sex, but alas, I hated them until the end. I want to spend the rest of my life forgetting them. Please, if you have indulged, let us make a pact. Read good things from now on, and if you cannot find works that satisfy your hunger for story, characters, and explicit sex, write something better. For all that is good and Holy please.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It is a Musician's Delight!<br /><br />Absolutely wonderful film! The actors, the divas all beautifully portrayed what Verdi House must have been like.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|My grandaughter loved it.  She wants to collect all Of the dolls.  Easy purchase for me. No real thinking for me.  Usually there are so many options for gifts and it is hard to choose with so many items on the market. This was a real winner
B005LAIIHG|4.0|The cinematography was amazing. The film beautifully rendered the author's imagination for the viewer.<br />Well worth viewing more than once.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|I liked the game at first, but then it started dragging on and on... back and forth, back and forth.  It really is tedious.  The ho scenes were fun, however I wouldn't recommend this game.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I kept finding myself rewinding, could not keep track. All over the place. Not interesting, expected to be much better
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I am a new Castle fan and absolutely love each episode.  Recomend this series to everyone who likes a good mystery with some banter along the way.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|both my husband and I enjoyed it very much.<br />I can wait to see Despicalbe Me 2 in themovies this week.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|A very well made story combining the background concept of Captain America with a way of bringing the character to the present day. I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Nice graphics. Simple controls. Easy enough to keep it fun, and challenging enough to keep you interested. Great for kids and adults.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Takes a character from Marvel who I didn't particularly like and makes an enjoyable story around him. It leaves enough unanswered questions to have me interested in a sequel, if one is made. definitely sets up interest for Avengers movies to come.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses.<br />In this movie she is fantastic.<br />It is a musical so if you don't like them, it won't be for you.<br />Love the acting and the beautiful sets.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movies based on several individual characters in the movie did a nice job leading into it, but Joss Whedon's ability as a director shines in making the pacing relentless, every shot important, and the whole of the story build something greater than the sum of the characters- though none of them fade into the backdrop. A very well written and balanced story which can be enjoyed more than once.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I liked this movie because of subject matter. It portrays seniors as being real people with real feelings.<br /><br />Also it was a pleasure not tobe bombarded with sex scenes and foul language
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|No CGI, very hands-on special effects, just well imagined cinematography with a compelling story focused around two lasting themes of the genre: Where is humanity going, and how is humanity defined?
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Could sit back and have a good laugh and not be bombarded with sex scenes and foul language.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed RED . My kind of movie
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I don't particularly like Jane Austen.  PD James did write a good mystery, but I don't like the social ideals of those times.
B000EQ5SRK|1.0|Too expensive. I found out later that was half that price here in Boise, Idaho. ALSO: it HAS been cut from the original version. Visual quality was poor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is perfect for me because I love the. minions and I love despicible me 1 and 2!! you should make more minion related products!
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|what is the point of it all u do is kill zombies u can do that in call of duty
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the minions they are so funny and now I'm a minion :) excellent game features and I love how we can see the world of Gru and his adopted daughters!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I loved this movie, but it was an emotional rollercoaster! Even though I knew how it would end I was gripped the entire time to see if the family would survive and find each other.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Liked the characters and would have loved the book but too much drama for me. I feel the back stories of the book are given in pieces that are not complete. Would have liked to know more.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|How can you go wrong with Mr. Washington. The movie could have been 15 minutes shorter with the same impact.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As expected from downton abbey--a great storyline that keeps you super interested with well developed characters.  Cant wait for season 4!
B009K0P10K|5.0|DYNASTY AND NIKKITA WRAPPED TOGETGER! IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WATCHING THIS SERIES! ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING FROM BEGINNING TO END! GREAT!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I love this Trilogy.  I think this movie is good, but the worst of the Trilogy.  The story drags a bit, but the payoff is good.  I don't like the beginning bits where batman is retired and all that junk, and the movie kinda drags in the middle.  The acting is good, but the cat-woman character seems random and probably could have been written out of the script, or at least her story could have been expanded so it has a point.  The acting is great, and the effects are fun.  This movie has the least 'wow' effects of the three.  Maybe the movie just has too many characters, hard to care about most of them as they don't have much screen time, just my opinion.<br /><br />That said, I love the Trilogy!  In my opinion these are the best batman movies ever and you should own them!  But, this movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter, and possibly better for it.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I loved it but after the update I lost my park and I had 2 gem dragon's and I spent 30$ on it
159315724X|5.0|A little about me. At 22 I owned an apartment building.  At 26 I was closing on a multi 6 figure income as a manufacturers rep.  Today my company has the most 5 stars (by a lot) of 101 competitors (that is all of them listed in super pages) in my field in  Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. I bought the audio of this book because Jeff Olson of \\"The Slight Edge\\" referenced Darren's book \\"The Compound Effect.\\"  It is obvious I have a high standard for satisfying the customer from the above information.  The Compound Effect has taken me to a higher level. By his example and the way he presents his information, I now see  a path for going even more the extra mile.  Based on his book, and the way he runs his life, there is no doubt I would be number 2 in 5 stars if I was competing against him. If you really want to gain some ground and you are looking for some sifted info, there is some here. I also liked the way he read the book.  He put a lot of emotion into it and that emotion is contagious for me.  I would ignore the strong negatives that some have given, and notice what most of the people are saying. I doubt some of negative people are really at the top of their game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Most of the 1 & 2 star reviews are based on the fact that people aren't getting three months of Netflix free. Seriously? Three months. Get over it and review the actual product.<br /><br />Product is great. Does exactly what I need it to do, exactly as advertised. If you have AirPlay, you might not find it that useful, but seeing as this is my first device->TV product, I love it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game. Some times I win some times I don,t.  When I lose I just want to play more.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I use an MK808B dongle Called a mini TV.Cost 40.00 and up, Has BLUETOOTH plus 2 USB inputs and can go \\"anywhere\\" your computer can go and is just as good. Can even hook up a keyboard and mouse, external flashdrive or hard drive. This also hooks up to your TV HDMI.<br /><br />CHUCKR
B0090P98Z4|4.0|This game is awesome with being able to fight dragons and demons this game is perfect for all action seekers.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|This would not function in the Kindle  - which I love BTW. i will easily find a way to youtube  - just give me more time. i just deleted it and will find an alternate.
B00DSAYADC|5.0|The all time classic with the original illustrations by Alcott's sister. A wonderful tale that is far more than a children's book -- its richness and drama make it a must read (and re-read) for men and women of all ages.
1426308469|5.0|I nought this for a little boy whose parents work so hard they never get to take him to the great museums in my area<br /> ( NYC ). He's a bit too young really but he LOVES this book and I got to see it and it IS a great book. Colorful, great pictures, informative and I also sent him a set of dinosaurs so he was thrilled. When he is a few years older I will make sure he gets more books which will send him far afield and even pay for him and his Mom to go to the American Museum of Natural History. I took my own son there when he was about 10 and we still go - but we take his wife and she loves it as well. Seeing something in person is so much better than on the net. I love shopping on Amazon because I have seen all the stores I ever need to see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was fully engrossed in this show. The acting was exeptional. The storyline was good but I would have liked more if it wasn't so soap opera-ish.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It is what you want to cover the F connector on your Nikor lens. This is not a shabby knock off.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Lot of fun<br />I like to get up and play all the time<br />If you have the time you should play
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started playing, truthfully I've seen better hidden object games out there but I figured I could give this one a chance being free and all. But so far, there's nothing out of this world to grab onto.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The book was good, however it got to be  slightly repetitive. I enjoyed the suspense in the middle  of the book. I would recommend the whole trilogy to anyone who is not taken back by some erotic language and situations.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Never read any other books by this author, but was told that this was his first \\"adult\\" book. This book should have definitely been classified as a book for tweens/young adults.
0375851569|5.0|I bought this collection for my 3 year-old nephew and he loves it so much. when I visited my sister, everyday my nephew used to pick one of the books and ask me to read it to him and it was so much fun I used to read the first part of the sentence and he completed it from his memory.<br />absolutely recommended!
B00B29J0I6|3.0|Makes you do math in a fun way. If you not good with it you still have fun watching him fall
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This one I highly RECOMMEND, though, I did dread, not in a bad way, reading this book because I'm a hopeless romantic and I always want a happy ending with the fictional characters that I read about. =)) I stayed up and finished this book early this morning and it's A MUST READ!!<br />John Green couldn't have come up with a more perfect title for Augustus and Hazel's story. It was very sad, but don't let that discourage you from reading it (it really is a good book), so sweet and beautifully written. Not to spoil anything, but have a box of tissue ready if you do decide to read it. I woke up with puffy eyes, but it was worth it. Happy Reading!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Kinds like tic tac toe. Don't have to think or really plan but makes neat designes but same colors. But its free
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Great movie has been one of my favorite movies for a long time definitely will watch again<br />Has a lot of bad language
B00881VLCE|4.0|Just like the real puzzle. Fun would be better if you could build up to harder puzzles Or diffrent pictures.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have enjoyed Downton Abbey immensely!  The dichotomy between the aristocracy and the servants is interesting and enlightening.  I never thought about the way the aristocracy lived and behaved before. Great show!
B00AHHODH2|5.0|If you're a fan of shows like Desperate Housewives that sway between the farcical and the semi-serious, with a lot of humorous coincidence thrown in, then this one's for you. The Southern lady dogwalkers of Gordonston are a gossipy bunch of drinkers with a little too much time on their hands. Their business is knowing, or imagining, everyone else's business in the small, privileged enclave where they live. Of course, the line they tread between consideration and meddling is too easily crossed. Add in hearty doses of judgment, deep veins of social propriety, the panicky need for absolute control, and you get a bunch of prim and proper wackos who will stop at nothing to maintain the sense of order each one requires. Unfortunately for the ladies, they are fighting a losing battle against the forces of Southern hospitality, a mid-life boob job, a life-changing trip to Paris, a contract assassin and a houseful of Nazis, not to mention the guy who doesn't pick-up his dog's poop. The author could easily be writing for TV. This is well done and a fun read, with a nice twist at the end to keep you guessing what's going to happen.
0316056871|4.0|with her hilarious comedy on 30 rock, as well as her appearances on SNL, Tina Fey normally does not disappoint... this book is no different.<br />I would ever suggest reading along with the book (or for a second time) with the audio book from A udible that (you guessed it) she reads.
0316174483|4.0|My daughter was invited to a 5 year old birthday party of a classmate who loves artwork! We purchased this book along with the FingerPrinting Art Set and Melissa and Doug 6 Color Stamp Pad. The gift was a hit! A lot of the others mom's wanted to know where we purchased from as it was out of the norm and cannot be found out our local retail chain stores. I love finding unique and creative gifts and this book not only inspires for stamping, but also with drawing pictures. Definitely something kids will have fun with!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I thought this book was going to be a bust. I didn't care for the Portuguese. Glad, really glad I stuck it out. Well thought out and all the characters were very believable. Highly recommended.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app for the large selection of sounds. You can even layer them together (think frogs and crickets by a creek or campfire in the woods with wolf howls). I haven't heard any gaps or patterns and I'm usually extremely sensitive to those sorts of things. My personal favorite is the river combined with the brown noise. I definitely recommend this app!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received my Chromecast early afternoon 07/25/2013. I ordered it from Amazon on 07/24/2013 a few minutes after it became available. So far the Chromecast is working as expected and as described, I bought it aware of what it can and can't stream. I use it in the master bedroom, where I have no internet or game consoles connected to my TV. Now the wife and I do not have to resort to our phones or tablet to watch a movie together on Netflix or a video from Youtube.<br /><br />My TV is mounted on the wall and extends/swivels outward, so I was worried I would not be able to extend the TV away from the wall If I had to use the wall outlet to power my Chromecast. Luckily for me, the USB port on my TV, which happens to be directly below the HDMI port the Chromecast is using, was able to power the Chromecast (not sure if it will work on every TV).<br /><br />Setup was extremely easy and within minutes I was steaming Netflix movies and Youtube videos. The load time for Netflix movies was not any longer that it usually takes on my PS3 (living room TV), the picture was HD quality and once the movie started, there was no lag or lowering of picture quality at any time. As I continued to watch the movie, I was able to leave the Netflix or Youtube app on my phone, while the movie remained playing on the TV, and I was able to check email and text messages on my phone without causing any issues to the stream. Unfortunately, I do not have a laptop, so I cannot say how the Chromecast works on laptops that steam Chrome tabs.<br /><br />In conclusion, this product is well worth the $35 price tag and I would recommend it for anyone looking to stream content (although limited at the moment) to their TV.<br /><br />If I experience any issues or problems in the future that cause the Chromecast not to work as it was intended, I will make sure to update my review.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy this product if you happen to buy it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|So far this little devise has done exactly as advertised.  It hasn't been used much so there might be a problem down the line, but the thing charges my iPad just fine, and I love that there is the android connection available too.
030758836X|2.0|I enjoyed the start of this book and character development.  I was curiuos and hopeful that the book could take it all the way to an excellent finish.  I am not one for needing a happy ending; however, the ending must be believable.  The ending was so out of left field it spoiled all the terrific writing.  She could have ended this in so many different ways.  So disappointing.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I really love this game, I first had this 1Mobile, but every time it update it quite playing so I uninstall it and reinstall through Amazon, so far it playing good, keep it working. yes I told all my friends about it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So, I was able to go to BestBuy yesterday around 6PM EST and pick up a new Chromecast. They had not even been put on the shleves yet but were still sitting on a box on the floor. I arrived home at around 630PM EST and plugged the device right into my TV. Some newer TV's will be able to power the Chromecast through HDMI but mine was unable. So I had to plug in the USB and power it off of my powerstrip.<br /><br />In the box it tells you to go to a website to download the chromecast app. At my house I have a Photon 4G, S2, Desktop and Nook HD. I was able to install the app on all 4 devices within a few minutes. You do have to setup the chromecast on your network with password but that took a few seconds. Once the install was complete all 4 devices updated to recognize the Chromecast. I jumped right onto Netflix and played some \\"Jake and the neverland pirates\\" for my 2 year old son. The video took around 5 seconds to load and was playing back at 1080P quality with no lag or refreshing. I then turned to my phone to see that, the show had automatically been recognized by my phone and I could control it. To test out if you needed any device on one a movie was playing I turned off all 4 devices and the video continued to play. I turned my phone back on and chromecast loaded and was able to recognize a show was still playing and let me go right back into control. We then tried Youtube and it worked perfectly as well. There was no lag at my house whatsoever.<br /><br />I'm working off of a 30MBs down speed from brighthouse. Now at first glance this is great for my family as we don't watch TV much and when we do its movies and or kids shows. I was able to use the chrome browser and stream that also it was maybe .5 seconds behind but was still very useful.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I like this game I am not very good at playing the cube, but I am working on it, I<br /><br />show it to my daughter, and she like it to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game (ages 14 and 12) and play it frequently.  I would say it's similar to the Subway Surfers game in format.  It's fast-paced and fun for different age groups, plus the minions are so cute!  (Kindle Fire and LG Spectrum user).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins knows how to keep a reader engrossed. If this series was meant for the teen audience, she crossed that line to keep me interested.

B008Y73940|5.0|the movie had a great cast.  The acting was very good and it had enough suspense to keep you interested.  We also did not figure out the ending halfway through the movie which is a  definite a plus.

B008B1BL4E|3.0|Readers who like history would find this as an useful book. Some of the date are well known, but it also has some information that I was not that familiar with, and it gives a kind of an advantage to the book. It takes time to read, because of a large number of people observed. It is not a page turner, but a good book to have in your library.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I saw this author at a writer's series.  She talked about the fact that her books were &#34;dark&#34;.  This comment made me curious to read them.  Although the book revolves around a character with a psychological problem, it was very well written, offers an insight into this type of sickness, and was well written.  I would call it thought provoking, rather than dark.  It was a very good read and I can't wait to read her other books!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You get to raise your own dragons. :) at first you think man this is boring then it's like oh I want that dragon so bad! Then you get it then your like o wow I want that dragon. This is the best game for any device. Get it
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Really interesting, different book. The author said he thought this book odd, and he was right( not that there's anything wrong with that). Very enjoyable read, good characters and story.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This series is awesome. Definitely waiting for this season to air. Am a die hard fan of the sons. Can't wait.

B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I love to read & love a good book but I just couldn't get into this.  I kept hoping &#34;something&#34; would happen, but it was very slow going.  I don't know why I bothered.  Waste of time.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|In the middle of reading this one but love it so far!  I look forward to finishing this one and purchasing the last book in the trilogy.
B008Y78M60|4.0|A very interesting and informative movie. I wonder how a jury of the defendent's peers would have changed the outcome?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I liked the series.  It was interesting seeing how people lived.  It was also interesting to see the changes in the family.
B00701L5XS|5.0|great for boy scouts or anyone learning to tie knots, being able to see all sides of the knot makes this different than knot-tying books

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Entertaining in a mindless sort of way. I am oddly drawn to the program to play my regenerated coins. Takes only a few minutes to blow thru them, but they are free so who cares.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I've been listening to this for the better part of a month and I absolutely love it. (I got a release from a cousin in Japan) I've always been a big fan of Portnoy and Sheehan. This CD introduced me to Kotzen. There are some wonderful hooks, great melodies not to mention the harmonies. This is a great CD with some virtuoso playing by all three guys. My only (I would hesitate to even call it a complaint) with this CD is that some of the guitar solos sound like they were pulled straight out of an '80s song. But there are so many other great things about these songs that a couple of guitar solos don't degrade a great listening experience. Straight ahead rock, blues and ballads are mixed (the mix is great as well by the way. You can hear every nuance of each instrument)together to make for a spectacular CD. Now to see if I can get to see them live!!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I enjoy all the different configurations & being able to change the background. This will keep me happy for quite some time.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|What might have been.<br /><br />That seems to be the recurring theme in the 5th volume of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". Characters are driven not so much by regret as they are by their drive to make amends for their perceived failures. Jon Connington failed to capture Robert Baratheon and thereby keep him from killing Prince Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident; Ser Barristan feels he could have changed the course of history if only he'd been able to win that all-important joust; Tyrion imagines a life of happiness if only he could have stayed married to the one girl he ever truly loved.<br /><br />While many of our favorite characters -- for me this includes Tyrion, Daenerys, Jon and Davos -- return for \\"A Dance With Dragons\\", Martin continues to spend a great deal of time with new and secondary characters, though I personally found the tales much more compelling here than in \\"A Feast For Crows\\". The various sellsword and mercenary outfits maneuvering around Mereen makes for some fascinating storytelling, and in particular the characters of Quentyn, Jon Connington and Brown Ben Plumm are welcome additions to Martin's canon. I also enjoyed Asha's story, and it was nice to see inside the mind of Barristan the Bold.<br /><br />That being said, Martin's storytelling does often have a tendency to drag, especially in the early goings (as a great deal of travel is required before many of the characters get to anywhere important) and during the final act as the story is winding down, when the plot seems to lose a bit of speed. Fans are also likely to be upset regarding the half-dozen or so cliffhangers Martin left unresolved, and we can only hope that Volume 6 won't be another near-decade in the making.<br /><br />All in all, however, it was a pleasure reconnecting with characters we've come to know (and expect to die almost every time they appear), and several of Martin's plot twists and plot developments were truly remarkable. This is a far cry above \\"A Feast for Crows\\", and we can only hope Martin can keep the momentum from what he achieved here as we roll into the next volume.d we can only hope Martin can keep the momentum from what he achieved here as we roll into the next volume.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is really fun and has a good concept as well. You can rescue injured animals and release them back into the wild
B000URWYTS|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; glimpse into Frank Lloyd Wright's life with Mamah Chadwick.  I found myself reflecting on the reasons behind the choices she made, especially choosing her life with Frank over that with her children.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Only occasionally does a mainstream artist manage to pull off incorporating the sounds of underground electronic music without stripping it of its vitality and implementing only its most overplayed and commercially accessible conventions. Mainstream music, after all, is like airplane food: it has to be just bland enough that most people can find something to like about it. It is a sound that is exactly nauseating to my ears. I need dissonance and conflict; I need something that is not fully appreciable with a single listen; I need something that is uncomfortable precisely because it is unfamiliar and doesn't just play to the trends. The pop music framework simply cannot produce that kind of music--it is a business model that happens to include artists, but not a model for artistry itself. Yeezy's albums have always been a disappointment to me for exactly that reason. Read reviews about his work with Jay-Z and how they toned down their most confrontational and boundary pushing aspirations in favor of more accessible tunes. Not so with this album. Kanye West has taken the plunge into the underground and fully transcended the mainstream music framework--and I couldn't be happier. I can understand why so many people are disappointed by this album. Most people want the audio space they inhabit to be organized around the familiar and the conventional. Consumers of popular music want their musicians to demonstrate familiarity and allegiance to the trends of the time. Black Eyed Peas' \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" is a audio catalog of the trendy sounds and lingo of its time, which is why it was so popular, despite being a completely idiotic song. Yeezy failed to provide the safe space pop music listeners need if they are to arrange their aural space in a way that compliments rather than challenges their assumptions--assumptions buried deep within the mainstream music framework. For that, he will be criticized and the same people who reward schlock pop musicians like Taylor Swift for their mediocrity will decline to award him for his masterful dominion over a (probably temporarily) newly adopted framework. But as far as I am concerned, Yeezus is an album that I can love. I hope he sticks with it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the next big thing! This is the beat one yet! I give it over  5 stars more like 100stars!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting account of Bin Ladens death.  We don't know what really happened in the raid, except for the lies Obama was telling.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Ricardo Montalban plays the perfect villain in this movie and almost makes you forget about fine Corinthian Leather. You should really have seen Star Trek Into Darkness before seeing this one, as it is somewhat of a sequel to the new movie. A little bit in reverse the 3 star Wars prequels  done By George Lucas.
0802130208|5.0|After living in New Orleans for so many years, I found this book to be pure joy!!  Rich with New Orleans flavor.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|This movie that continued the story that began with the wrath of Kahn showed the caring of the members of the crew for each other, especially the bond between Kirk & Spock.  I don't want to say more in case somewhere out there someone has not seen this movie My suggestion is Force yourself to watch the badly done Star Trek The Movie. Then Wrath Wrath of Kahn, Then follow it up with this one. You won't be dissappointed!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think it was captivating and fun! A lot of these types of games are too easy or frustrating. Once I started playing this game I didn't want to stop until I completed it. Addictive!  I just wish there were more levels!!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|when I updated this app it nearly crashed! I didn't want to uninstall then reinstall it! I had a double rainbow dragon on the way in my nursery!! that would have been awful!

B001UV4XUG|2.0|I can think of a few movies of this type which are much better. \\"Singles\\" (Matt Dillon, Fonda), \\"Rules Of Attraction\\" (Sossamon), \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" (Meg Ryan), \\"Reality Bites\\" (Winona Ryder).<br /><br />All these movies have a similar theme. ..I don't know why this movie rates so highly with so many people. It's not as witty, funny, or entertaining as any of the movies mentioned. ..The characters don't even seem real. ..It's like watching \\"The Making Of 500 Days\\"<br /><br />It is unique in one sense. The beginning of the movie reveals that the relationship is going nowhere. ..Fortunately, most movies don't use this technique. ..And if you're hoping or waiting for a twist ending, you will be disappointed. ..The ending does make an attempt to make it feel like it was worth watching. ..It didn't work for me.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I found his book very helpful and informative. I also find his website and the testimony of others very enlightening! For me, the part about getting real with myself was the key. I felt what others were saying and ran with it! It was the bell going off in my head that I needed! This is worth every penny! Thank you!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is somewhat similar to the games of yore wherein you have to match up at least 3 of the same type of thing in a row either horizontal or vertical, but with some great improvements and innovation. This game has a pretty cool upgrade system which allows you to advance further into the game until ultimately you can score 10,000,000 points on a single run and free yourself from imprisonment. Very cool and highly recommended!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game was not worth it.  it kept on freezing as soon as you got to vector. not worth it.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|The presentation was excelent, it was all in perfect condition, the box is really awesome and also the egg, but smaller than I spect. The extra material explain some of the history of the show, letting you learn more of the GOT world.<br /> The product arrived on time.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game and say it's better than temple run 1 & 2.  They play it so much that I should just keep the kindle on the charger.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've had this sharpener for years and it's never done me wrong.  It sharpens everything from kitchen knives to Moras to ka-bars.  The carbide and ceramic bits have never dulled on me, they work awesomely.  The part that I especially love is the fold-out sharpening stick.  It really lets you get into the serrations and clean them up.  My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that its so small and compact I tend to lose it!  But that's on me, the size is a definite plus.<br /><br />Side note:  I got mine at Home depot for $11, this is a way better price.
1607066017|5.0|This is like Star Wars meets Romeo and Juliet if they had a kid and Romeo had horns and Juliet had wings.  Just read it, it is fantastic and if you don't believe me look into the critical praise.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. But I just want to say something to the people who gave this app a bad rating for it being slow, have you thought that you have slow or bad internet. You don't have to blame app for something that you or something you have is causing. Take responsibility for a chance. Because when I played the app it went really well and I would recommend it to anyone who like temple run or subway surfers.
B001BR7CU2|5.0|Love this move, Been a while since i watch it. Reminds me when I was younger. Funny, Sexy, Weird !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome it is so cool and you will have a lot of fun with this game you will love it!!!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book and almost abandoned it several times. It was very slow and introspective. I l oved Independence Day so this was a disappointment.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I got this a while ago when it was the free app of the day. But there was just so much to do that I couldn't just play a little and write some half-hearted review for it. So, now that I've played this game for a while, I can give it a good shot (pun not intended).<br /><br />First of all, this a really fun platformer game that many will enjoy. The controls are extremely intuitive, and the gameplay is simple - click the monkey to wake him/her up, go through the level, vine by vine, avoiding spikes and rubbery spiders, timing jumps onto bouncy mushrooms and caterpillars and trigger tree branches, all to get to the end of the level with a party of monkeys waiting for you. This is the basis for every single level, and yet there's enough variety that it doesn't get boring.<br /><br />As you're going through these levels, there are two types of collectibles you need to get. The first one is the game's currency, and since we're dealing with monkeys, it makes sense for the currency to be bananas! There are several ways you can collect bananas:<br /><br />1) Follow the long trails on bananas. These trails come in groups of 4-7 on average, and each banana you collect in succession without landing on a platform anywhere gives you +1 incremental point value, and the last banana gives you +100 point value. If you land before you get them all or you collect them in the wrong order, the point values are lost.<br /><br />2) Bugs! All those little ladybugs and bees give you +100 banana points when you hit them. In the fourth group of levels, some of those brown cocoons that you hit also contain bugs.<br /><br />3) Hit the bad guys! At least two types of bad critters give you bananas. One is those pesky frogs that throw bombs out of there mouths at you. Just press down on the vine to avoid the bombs, then hit the frogs while their heads are popping out. The second type is bee nests. For these critters, you wack the nest three times (preferably without hitting the bees). Each time, you will have to duck by pressing down on the vine when you land again, because those bees will come after you, first one, then three, then five. After the nest is hit a third time, the bees run off and you get a banana! A couple tips: You can buy a powerful that lets you just blast through the nest in one shot (more on how to buy later). You can also confuse the bees into not chasing you by landing on a different vine other than the one you jumped off of. Not sure if it works all the time, but if it does, then the bees will go to the initial vine instead.<br /><br />So, the purpose of currency, of course, is to buy stuff! You can use those bananas to buy powerups that can help you through the game a little easier, like a gem locator that shows you where gems are, or a powerup that helps you make a more accurate jump off a vine. The powerups are not permanent and eventually get used up, requiring more bananas to buy more use a of the powerup.<br /><br />The other main collectible in this game is gems. Each level contains five gems that need to be sought out. The gems are also sort of like a form of currency, but they are used to unlock new levels rather than buy things. Also the gems give the game a higher challenge, as not all of the gems are in easy-to-find places. A lot of the gems are in hidden locations, in places that are not easily accessible, or in places where accurate jumping is needed in order to avoid missing the gem. After a gem is collected, the gem will be replaced by a 100 point banana on future runthrough of that level, even if you exit or restart the game without getting to the end of the level.<br /><br />In addition to the gem playthrough, there are a few other features to this game that add to the fun (and the challenge):<br /><br />- Totem playthrough - In this mode, you play through the levels on a time limit. Each level in this mode has its own set of 5 challenges to complete. Each challenge completed earns you a medal. To unlock more levels inthis mode, you earn medals similar to the way you do with gems. There are several types of challenges you can play through, including time trial, collecting items in a certain amount of time, blowing up purple mines, and vine jump accuracy (called on par).<br /><br />- Quick play - In this mode, you can play through any of the levels you have already unlocked with any of the challenges from the Totem trials. You don't earn medals - this mode is simply for having fun for hours on end!<br /><br />- Unlockable monkeys - Initially, you start out with one playable monkey. There are four monkeys total that you can play as. To unlock them, you have to play through and finish a certain number of levels (or collect a certain number of gems, I'm not sure).<br /><br />- Acheivements - Last but not least, as if this game wasn't funpacked enough, there are a total of 51 achievements to unlock in this game. Some are pretty easy, like collecting all the bananas in a level or collecting one gem from each level. Some are time consuming, like getting all the medals in the Totem trials, or even playing the game for a week straight (not literally, just playing everyday for a week). Others require you to go online, like going on Facebook and Twitter to like the page or follow the feed.<br /><br />All in all, I think that this game was a steal as FAOTDs go. There is so much to do in this game; I haven't even gotten through half the stuff I've described in this review. However, it's so much fun that it's worth all the time it consumes. I highly recommend this game, it is definitely worth the price. And with no permissions, it's even better.<br /><br />- Sam

I actually did end up caring about some of them but not enough to justify the time i wasted watching. i really can't summarize the story in the space provided here but i would say wait till its free with the Amazon Prime membership. don't waste good money on this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It reminds me of a better temple run, with the funniest characters in animation history. My favorite part is when you battle vector. TOTALLY worth it.

B000OZ0NXA|2.0|This book was just too out there.  This was not a believable story.  Who in America uses &#34;straight away&#34;?  To many coincidences.  This is the first book I have read by Mr. Child's and will probably be my last.
B00BY1F8UQ|4.0|I like this CD, with the exception of the first piece, which I usually just skip.  I have several of his CDs and have liked his artistry for some time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun! this game is hilarious and very easy to play. great for kids. make sure you do the practice first
B00DSY8D36|5.0|Dropbox functionality to boot.  The ability to work with off was my Kindle fire biggest weakness. The speech features is great...too. I Was waiting for this. Am I dreaming?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I just dont like that it lags a little bit. and the chaleges should give us more minion coins
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game. The only downfall is that it sometimes freezes when you get going really fast. Other than that I cant seem to stop playing it.
B002ZG999U|5.0|The Expendables is a simple action movie that delivers. I didn't think the movie would be able to pull off the stunt of having all the action heroes at the same time but Stallone proved me way wrong! Matter of fact, he spreads the action for everyone evenly to showcase there talent. Is the story worth mentioning? NO! The highlight of course is the scene with Willis, Stallone and Big Arnold. Even though it lasts for a few minutes it is classic to see the three icons together. Some tease the scene with Rourke and Stallone (the drama moment) but it did its job and showcased Rourke as the drama guy vice the action hero of the film. The only one I didn't like was Lundgren as the big brain-dead brute Gunner; his performance was equal to his character in the original Universal Solider. Eric Roberts was kinda weak as the rouge CIA bad guy, but Austin helps him out of that jam. Finally, the last 20 minutes gives the action lover exactly what we want: fights, lots of explosions, broken necks and bones, and plenty of bullets flying. In summary this is a great action flick and it does its job in providing the goods.<br /><br />Bottom line this is a awesome tribute to great action movies and great action stars.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|I have some mixed feelings about this book.  I will admit I had high expectations, which is usually a setup for disappointment, and it was to a point.  I wasn't blown away by the book, but I did enjoy it.  I like Pia, and Dragos is pretty dreamy, however they both had their flaws.  Pia's flaws were endearing, but Dragos took some getting used to.  I like an alpha male, but he's downright overbearing.  I did, however, adore how he learned to say please!<br /><br />The urban fantasy setting was pretty cool.  I liked the different races and how they're set up.  It definitely has room for sequels that can go in just about any direction.  I also liked that while some of the races were about what I expected, others weren't quite typical.  Not everything and everyone is as they seem and it made for some very interesting experiences.<br /><br />The plot is where I had some issues.  There are some questions left unanswered, some loose ends not quite tied up, and there were some events and experiences that I felt were unnecessary to the book and/or unrealistic under the circumstances.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed a lot of the characters, including many of the secondary ones, and while it didn't knock my socks off, Dragon Bound was an enjoyable read and I'm looking forward to checking out the next book!<br /><br />**I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.**
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Expendables 2 played off the strengths of the first, while also expanding on it's weaknesses as well. Instead of mere cameos, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger play have acting roles and of course, none other than CHUCK NORRIS comes in! The tongue in cheek references to past hit movies from each of the leading actors is priceless, down to the subtle commentary about Dolph Lundgren's characters intelligence. Unlike before, Jet Li shows off his hand to hand fighting skills as does Jason Statham, though Jet Li's time on screen is far too limited for my taste. It even leaves room to pass the baton to up and coming action stars (younger Helmsworth and Scott Adkins). There is little adherence to a plot, but that serves this particular movie well. It doesn't pretend to be an Oscar, rather, it allows itself to live up to it's true purpose- a tribute, an homage to the high intensity action stars from the 80's and 90's. One of my favorite movies of all time!<br /><br />Bottom line if you loved the first you will love this one as it dose deliver.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Violence is frequently associated to third world developing countries or regions where there are ethnic or religious tensions. Nothing that you would expect to find in the nordic scandinavian countries. However, they offer us very good writers like Stieg Larson and Joe Nesbo.<br /><br />The intuitive alcoholic Norwegian cop Harry Hole is a very well defined personality, at the same level of Adam Dalgliesh and Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg. The conflict of the Norwegian police, trying to hide their best cop, because of his unaccepyable behaviour, but, on the other hand, having to accept him because of his detective qualities is amazing.<br /><br />I definitely recommend the book - and all the following written by Nesbo.
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|This movie was recommended to me and it turned out to be extremely entertaining.  I would recommend it to my friends!
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|This is a beautiful movie with a not-too-gushy, semi-predictable love story. But the real reason you need to watch this? The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is divine. Well work a watch.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Great for all the right reasons. This movie has it all . A must see for anyone. Takes you on a journey across time & space. Well have Ive hit the 20 words yet. lol
1476733953|5.0|I don't normally read science fiction but I loved this book.  I can't wait to read the next book, Shift.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I was new to this series when I found it on prime's instant video and I'm very glad I did.  I especially like the character developement.  The lead actress, Anna Torv, is refreshing.  So often the women leads are caustic, abrasive, unlikeable.  Not so in this series.  The parallel universes and dopplegangers are great touches.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't have to wait for weekly updates.  Watching several episodes at a time is the way to go for me.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|I got exactly what I expected from this movie. A good way to kill a couple of hours.  As long as you don't go into it expecting an Oscar winning movie, you wont be disappointed.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish there were more levels. Fun game with interesting puzzles. The graphics are simple and don't bog down the Kindle Fire.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Is a good game worth getting if you like this kind of thing<br />The big ugly demon on the cover is perfect for the game
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent historical novel with a beautiful story of the human spirit and the true meaning of family. Highly recommended summer reading!
B005LAIIKI|2.0|First off, the criticism is due to the advertising of this as an UltraViolet bundle.  It is not. I activated the code with my VUDU account, but it didn't link to my UltraViolet account.  I contacted support, first through UltraViolet and then was forwarded to VUDU. They explained that the movie is not UltraViolet supported, which is why it isn't showing up on my UltraViolet account from VUDU.<br /><br />I find this ridiculous as the bundle is described as, \\"Django Unchained (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)\\".<br /><br />That being said, I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Always love any book by Nicholas Sparks and this one was great! Thoroughly enjoyed it..............Would recommend it to anyone, they would not be disappointed.

B000B589JI|5.0|I read other reviews where people had problems with a leaking<br />o ring, so I was prepared to fix that, but there was no need.<br />The fuel canister worked perfectly and did not leak.  It has a<br />very nice finish and I have no complaints whatsoever. :)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Going through my amazon orders list, been using this for over 2-years.<br /><br />It does what it's designed to do.  I've learned though past builds it's not worth it to go cheap on power and cooling, or really anything for that matter.  It's pretty darn big but any standard case can handle it.  Noise level is tolerable, it's not extremely quiet but much quieter than most stock heatsink fans.
1932735410|5.0|PMP Exam Prep did an excellent job preparing me for the PMP Exam.  The book provides details that you won't find in the PMBOK, that show up on the exam.  I found it to be an excellent companion to the PMBOK.  Exam questions at the end of each chapter are representative of the types of questions you are likely to see on the exam. If you have disciplined study habits, practical experience in project management and follow Rita's &#34;Tricks of the Trade&#34; you should be able to pass the exam on the first try.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! It's the best sequel to the original book, I can't wait for the third one! Fave book
B0063IH60K|2.0|I bought the free version since that's what I have on my iPhone. Unfortunately on the Kindle you get an annoying ad at the start of every game. Some you can skip, but others you can't.
0765334798|3.0|John Scalzi's \\"Redshirts\\" is a funny, quick read with several good parts and some very interesting philosophical questions.  Yet, when I was done reading, I felt very unsatisfied.<br /><br />The concept is hilarious.  You're probably familiar with what happens to \\"redshirts\\" on \\"Star Trek.\\"  If an unknown gets beamed down to a planet along with Captain Kirk and the other regulars, guess who's going to get shot by the laser!  It's going to be the unknown dude.<br /><br />On \\"Star Trek,\\" these poor \\"redshirts\\" don't know what's about to happen to them, but in Scalzi's book, they figure it out.  They avoid away missions and try their best to maximize survival.  Sounds hilarious, doesn't it?<br /><br />Well ... it was until I got about halfway through and the concept wore thin.  Plus ...<br /><br />#1) The plot was very simple.  The ending was abrupt and didn't provide a good sense of closure.<br /><br />#2) The several f-bombs and \\"college dorm\\" situations seemed inconsistent with the whole established Star Trek universe.  I felt a little gypped, as the book didn't \\"feel\\" like what I expected.<br /><br />#3) The characters were very bland and difficult to remember -- which I expect may be intentional, because they are \\"redshirts\\" after all.  But still, they seemed like pawns moving through a series of very helpful coincidences.<br /><br />I did enjoy the philosophical questions Scalzi raised.  My favorite part turned out to be the \\"first person\\" Coda.  There was some really good stuff in there.  I just wish the rest of the book had Scalzi's usual intelligence and fulfilling story telling.<br /><br />My recommendation ... if you're looking for a light, funny read, then check this book out from the library.  Otherwise, you may better enjoy other Scalzi books such as \\"Old Man's War.\\"
B009GYSQV6|4.0|Very very good release! Lots of sound effects/filtered bass/great vocals with massive amounts of reverb/delay. The theme throughout the album is dark and cold and the songs are pretty memorable.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|The item came on time, fit its online description verbatim, and functioned as I need it to do. However, the reasion it's not perfect is because after only one use, one of the tripod legs came off of the stand. Luckily though, it's easy to reattach
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Phoenix's sound keeps on evolving since the release of It's Never Been Like That - Bankrupt is a testament to it. All the tracks featured on the album are awesome! Production and song writing is top notch :: Be sure to check out the video for Entertainment . . . *****
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|yet I'd recommend it because it is cool with the special effects as well as the love story and with the two mixed, along with good acting, it is too hard to turn it off and away. Do I have a second here folks, not too bad eh??
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game! I think there should be some mini games you can unlock by doing certain things. Ex: Unlocking Fluffy. All in all,this is a really great game.
030758836X|2.0|I with the folks that were disappointed by the ending. This was certainly not the best page turner I've read, but it kept my interest most of the way through. It quickly wrapped up at the end and of course ended the way it did, which was very underwhelming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. great for a horse lover. its almost real. wish it was all free. at least earning gems isn't hard.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|2 fantastic British actors with a modern twist to Sherlock Holmes.  You might be skeptical at first but you will not be unhappy you watched. Guaranteed.  Cannot wait for Season 3!
B005S9EJ14|3.0|I put the video in and was confronted with several 20th Century Fox ads for their Blu-Ray movies that lasted about 5 minutes. I clicked the Play button and the video stopped. I had to start all over again with the ads for their movies. By that time I almost lost interest in watching the film. So, each time you want to view this video, you have to watch the same ads over again: no skipping ahead to avoid them. Annoying to the point that I won't buy any other videos distributed by 20th Century Fox....<br /><br />The film has been described well already. It is an interesting look at those having to make decisions as to where to live when life diminishes money and health. The choice of the internet ad for an Exotic Indian Hotel is a typical overblown description of its true condition, and each person reacts differently to life in India.<br /><br />The characters are not all fully developed, but one man does have a particular interest in re-visiting his old neighborhood -- which has changed completely. We see his anguish and a later reaction, thus making his story more interesting. Maggie Smith does a particularly good representation of those who only go to India for cheaper surgery than in England, and her part is well presented all through the film. Her role changes from one aspect to an ending which is a surprise.<br /><br />The film is one you want to say is \\"wonderful.\\" However, it almost glosses over too many characters who cannot all have their stories developed. Dench portrays a widow who decides to \\"go it alone\\" instead of moving in with her children, and I waited for a better storyline than quickly finding a job -- and then she almost flounders through the rest of the film. As always, a good performance, but not up to the par we expect.<br /><br />The young owner of the hotel and his mother have a more involved and interesting portrayal of the traditions of Indian families, and he is the \\"best\\" character in the film, IMO.<br /><br />It is a film for those who enjoy a rather slow-moving peek into seniors' lives who must find a less expensive way of living. The busy streets of the city are what you can see/hear on any very short travel video. I can recommend it with reserve, but don't expect an exciting adventure or even an intensive look into each character's personality or the changes that may or may not happen to them. I happen to like this type of film, but it isn't for everyone. The actors are fine, but it lacks substance. Again, just my opinion.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. They did a great job keeping with the hunger games theme. Loved how they are advancing the storyline & Keeping the reader entertained with each page
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have to admit I was moved to tears and will miss the characters in this story.  Although, gut-wrenching at times I still didn't want this book to end.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|If you've already read my site's review of Guillermo del Toro's new sci-fi epic Pacific Rim, you'll know by now that I absolutely loved it from start to (almost) finish. A few clichéd relationships and a good dose of summer camp brought the film down at points but these ended up being forgivable shortcomings when put into perspective of the entire package: giant robots vs. giant monsters. I mean, what more could one expect from a movie with the tagline \\"go big or go extinct\\"? Del Toro dared to go big and, thankfully, original and it paid off in spades, making Pacific Rim the surprise hit of the summer for me.<br /><br />  Also a surprise was Ramin Djawadi's score for the film. In interview, del Toro explained how he first became aware of Ramin Djawadi through his addiction to popular Fox series Prison Break, which the composer scored from 2005-2009. What struck him was how Djawadi's music was so integral to his enjoyment of the show's remarkable energy. \\"His scores have a grandeur and also have an incredible sort of human soul\\" del Toro stated while working with Djawadi on Pacific Rim. Not everyone in the film music community would expressly agree with del Toro. Since his score for Iron Man put him on the radar, Djawadi has received mixed criticism and praise for his aggressively synthesized/electronic sensibilities and reliance on the Remote Control Productions toolbox for most projects. Personally, I have always enjoyed Ramin Djawadi's work with a kind of guilty pleasure mindset; his scores often work functionally in the film and usually produce two to three tracks worth listening to on their own, even when he avoids exploring the most thematically developed of routes. \\"Driving with the Top Down\\", the standout cue from his otherwise average score for Iron Man, was a good bit of RC fun and Clash of the Titans provided a few cues that wouldn't tempt traditionalists but entertained me well enough as \\"tepid\\" as they might have been. Despite these leaps into film, though, television seems to be Djawadi's forte. His music for HBO's mega-hit Game of Thrones has gotten better with every season and has garnered significant critical praise. Thus, it's hard to deny that Djawadi has at least made his own niche in the industry. With regard to his style, I suppose it all comes down to whether you consider Hans Zimmer's masculine power anthems and synthetic ostinatos a viable direction for your choice blockbuster sound.<br /><br />  Such a consideration, luckily for us, didn't faze director Guillermo del Toro when he sought out Ramin Djawadi to score his monster-mash epic, providing  the composer with a chance to write what may be the best score of his still young career. Djawadi applies to Pacific Rim all of the bells and whistles we've come to expect from a score by a Remote Control Productions veteran. What's different here is that Djawadi weaves these elements together into an overall package that exudes an effortless sense of style and fun, something mostly lacking in his previous efforts. At the heart of this score is Pacific Rim's main theme, an insanely catchy rock-orchestral anthem. Heard in full in \\"Pacific Rim\\", the theme is composed of a fabric that makes up much of the rest of the score: powerful orchestra, rock influences, and well-integrated electronic elements. It's got a slightly campy, retro feel to it that puts it right at home in the comic-bookish world of the film, but it's still modern and forceful enough to be taken seriously by critics. What's more, this is by no means an underdeveloped, simplistic theme like a few of Djawadi's previous efforts. \\"Pacific Rim\\" is a well constructed, nearly 5-minute track that plays during Raleigh and Yancy Becket's suit up at the beginning of the film and serves as the basis in one way or another for almost everything that comes after it. This development and incorporation of the main theme into almost every aspect of the score is something that Djawadi has up until now only truly successfully tackled on Game of Thrones.<br /><br />  The main theme, for instance, recurs for a full, triumphant, and heavily electronic return in \\"Go Big or Go Extinct\\", showcasing Djawadi's smart intuition to save full reprisals of it for only the coolest of scenes. A Jaeger wielding a Hong Kong cargo ship like a baseball bat is certainly one of those scenes.<br /><br />  The score's rousing B-theme, heard at 3:11 in \\"Pacific Rim\\", serves as the basis for \\"Gipsy Danger\\", the theme for the film's focal Jaeger and the program as a whole. In this track, as in \\"Pacific Rim\\", you'll notice the frequent use of the Inception \\"horn of doom\\", the testosterone boosting \\"bwwooooomm\\" that Hans Zimmer has become infamous for. It blends into the orchestral fabric well enough to forgive the inclusion, its punctuation of certain notes adding to the score's larger than life, self-aware camp. The B-theme of \\"Pacific Rim\\" also informs the track \\"To Fight Monsters, We Created Monsters\\", which accompanies the film's opening montage, and \\"Physical Compatibility\\", among others. It is even seamlessly spliced with pieces of the main theme in \\"Jaeger Tech\\" and \\"Deep Beneath the Pacific\\". While the main theme relies on coolness and exhilaration, tapping into the innate awesomeness of the concept, the B-theme lends gravity and a rousing sense of hope to the story.<br /><br />  Djawadi also varies both the main theme and the B-theme from their normally driving tempos to one of a slower, more majestic build to represent humanity. This is a beautifully warm and stirring theme, employing gradually building strings and brass to tingle your spine in \\"Canceling the Apocalypse\\" before it later gets your blood pumping in \\"We Are the Resistance\\". Also present here is Tom Morello and George Doerning's electric guitar work underlying the orchestra in a more reserved manner than their catchy riffs in \\"Pacific Rim\\".<br /><br />  Other material includes a haunting character theme for Mako Mori, Raleigh Beckett's enigmatic co-pilot. By use of a fragile, solo female voice in \\"Mako\\" (ala Gladiator), Djawadi reminds us of just how much Mako's childhood encounter with the Kaiju plays into her adult character. The theme appears again tenderly in \\"Better than New\\" for an intimate moment between Mako and Raleigh. The Mako material also doubles, interestingly enough, as the film's general theme for loss, appearing in \\"We Need a New Weapon\\" as Raleigh stumbles out of Gipsy Danger after his own traumatic episode. Additionally, a bouncy theme for Dr. Newton Geiszler is a nice touch on subdued electronics in \\"Call Me Newt\\" and \\"Kaiju Groupie\\" and Hannibal Chau's suitably ethnic, seedy theme in \\"Hannibal Chau\\" is another nice character piece. All in all, Djawadi does a surprisingly good job with providing these relatively minor characters with their own musical identities, each theme painting a clear, accurate picture of their personality.<br /><br />  Finally, there's the material for the monstrous Kaiju. Fittingly simplistic and brute, the powerful brass and slamming percussion thrashes up and down the notes with tremendous force, matching the sheer gargantuan menace of these other-dimensional beasts. The Kaiju theme is a nice throwback to the legendary scores of Akira Ifukube for the Godzilla franchise, particularly the iteration of the monster's theme heard in \\"Main Title/Hong Kong Destruction!\\" from Godzilla vs. Destroyah. Though Djawadi accomplishes it with a less personality than Ifukube, he nevertheless provides a suitably threatening identity for Pacific Rim's baddies, heard in \\"Just a Memory\\", \\"2500 Tons of Awesome\\", \\"Category 5\\", and \\"The Breach\\". Nothing I'll be humming like Godzilla's march but it gets the job done.<br /><br />  With Guillermo del Toro's wonderfully imaginative and visually stunning playground of monsters and machines as inspiration, Ramin Djawadi has constructed what may be the best score of his career. While hampered by a horribly out of order albumrelease (the last track on the album, for instance, include's the film's main title music) and some not altogether convincing material for the Russian Jaeger pilots (see 1:34 in \\"Shatterdome\\"), Djawadi's Pacific Rim delivers greatly on fun and flat-out coolness. It may get some flack from the harshest of critics but its catchy main theme and overall spirit should make the score an enjoyable addition to any playlist of 2013's best guilty pleasures.<br /><br />Go to www . moviemusicmania . com for more great score reviews! Happy listening!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Had it out of the box, plugged in, connected to my network and streaming Netflix in about 3 minutes. Simplicity rocks. I've got XBox Gold, Roku, HDMI cables for my laptop and phone, but this device is perfect for it's ease of use. I'll definitely be dropping it in my pocket to carry on vacation, business travel, etc. And, since the SDK was just released, app develops will have other streaming apps working soon I'm sure. Looking forward to seeing what sort of functionality the hackers can get out this little piece of streaming hardware.

B005M5PENG|4.0|Hawaii Five-0 is a visually appealing show.  It is fast moving and reasonably exciting.  The trouble is, we've seen it all before.  The show and its characters seem very much like their counterparts on the various CSI show, NCIS, and all the rest.  They're all a bunch of pretty boys who just aren't convincing in the roles they play.  The big difference between the original and the current version is that originally there was a mystery involved in most episodes that held your attention.  The bad guys were frequently thoroughly despicable and the viewers  were glad when McGarrett would put 'em away with his \\"book 'em, Danno.\\"  The new show is just all slam bang action.  I guess tv producers think we're all too dumbed down to appreciate a mystery. I submit that it was a big mistake to redo the characters of the original Five-O.  The new version might have worked better if the personnel were portrayed as a new generation of people in the positions of McGarrett et al.  But these guys just don't make it as tough guys, and I don't care about gentle cops.  I find Alex O'Laughlin  a wimpy version of the Five-0 boss.  Scott Caan is a pale copy of his father and the others are not in the least impressive.  It also bugs me for them to chase bad guys in Chevy Cameros and Harley Springer street cruisers as in shades of Miami Vice and Nash Bridges.  There's a long tradition of TV cops; Joe Friday, Dan Matthews,  Theo Kojak, and yes Steve McGarrett. In my opinion the new Hawaii Five-0 force aren't in that league.  I was never a great fan of Jack Lord, but he made Hawaii Five-O work
B007EE4XKI|3.0|Good and bad fill this book. While the bookends feel very Star Trek, and the revisiting of history is great, the main &#34;meat&#34; of the book seems to feel like a different story. Not a bad one, but its focus is more Orwellian than Star Trek. Some good bits make this a read, but only on sale or borrow.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Nicolas Cage was on a roll with one bad movie after another. This one is a start to a better streak of his movies. After a rough start, it gets really action packed and the end isn't a dream sequence.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|good choices of melodies and to be able to mix them together is even better.  easy to use and very relaxing.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It brings back good memories.  I saw the original in my youth and loved it.  It was good to see it again.
1594744475|5.0|I think the price is a little too high, but the recipe are good, lots of colorful pictures. +. +.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies! could not ask for a better family movie! I love it! :)
B0030N3O8Y|3.0|i have watched 24 since season 1 to 8. no big difference between them. always there is a mole inside CTU or FBI (season 7). so, the story should be improved, more unpredictable. sometime, the story doesn't make sense, how Jack Bauer alone can win againts more than 5 hostiles.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The whole Lincoln story is actually a very interesting story, and I was excited to see it thinking it would show the battles and everything, but all it was was Lincoln and everyone mumbling around a table in a room practically the whole time. Super boring!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i really liked the book it was better than the movie cant wait to read the second and third book
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book is a little technical and 'over my head' in parts, due to the brilliance of the author, but the story as a whole is interesting, inspiring and so incredible, I'd encourage everyone to read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Not only does Pinterest give your boredom something to think about...it is wholesome good fun! This app is the ultimate pin board for everything you want to keep and everything that interests or inspires you!
B002SGYPS2|4.0|I don't care much for Jim Carrey but this definitely was one of his best movies.  He demonstrated that he could truly act and not just be a total idiot.  The idea of creating a reality show of someone's life was great.  This movie came out before today's reality shows.  I  definitely would recommend.
B008RTE066|5.0|The package is amazing! I am very pleased with it and thrilled to finally have it on Blu Ray. I am also a proud owner of the original 1967 EP.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|Enjoyable movie.  Pretty short, but it kept my attention.  Good actresses and actors, one of better movies in this genre on Amazon Prime.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is very good and I like the weapons too. They Ned to update the app more often though. The only bad part is that they Rent real.
B004KAWC0C|4.0|Beautiful scenery, filmography, and music. Antonio Banderas does a phenomenal job.  Madonna's seemed to lack the more theatrical singing style was mediocre at best, but I'd still recommend it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game it's so fun! Wish you could earn more tokens without having to pay but very fun! Kindle fire!
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Came undamaged in the box. I bought this so I could use it in my dorm where the wifi is not very good. It works as described. I don't think I'll have any problems with this. If I do I'll update this review.

B005UDD1R6|1.0|Well this is one of the worst apps i have owned. Once i got it, it told me in a popup saying i needed to update it to use it. I dont reccomend buying it.
B00160FBWK|5.0|Aliens is one of the best movies out there! Could watch it over and over again. I recommend this movie!
0441009425|3.0|Very good book with a lot of depth, dare I say too much depth. The story is good but very slow to get started, the way the story jumps from person to person is difficult to follow sometimes (especailly at the first). Very good background and detail with the human social evolution interestingly explained. If you like the technical and social aspects of Sci-fi I would strongly suggest this book...however I will not be purchasing the follow-ups.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Amazing book I read the whole thing in a day!! I couldn't put it down. A sad story that turns into a beautiful romantic ending!! Loved it and I totally recommend it to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its awesome, amazingly funny!!! Congratulations but you may create other ways to get coins ;) anyway i spend hours playing this game with my baby who loves it too
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really liked this app until the update.  What's with the stupid pictures that have nothing to do with the area you are trying to see? I am looking for a new weather app.
B00DYESRZY|5.0|Nobody else in music does what Andrew Hung and Benjamin Powers do.  They have relatives, yeah; for instance, Emeralds or Theologian.  There's no shortage of electronic drone and noise acts out there.  But no one gives massive slabs of sound the progression and grandeur that these guys do.  They're true originals, like Burial on the dubstep side, and it seems like it's going to take quite some time for imitators to catch up to them.  That means this is the only place you can get what Hung and Powers are selling.  It doesn't matter whether Slow Focus is better or worse than [[ASIN:B002NNKLJM Tarot Sport]] or their first album, [[ASIN:B0026XTCNU Street Horrrsing]], because if you have those, this is the only other thing you can get that's even in the ballpark. (Power's solo project [[ASIN:B004YWZUZ0 Blanck Mass]] is far mellower and isn't trying to imitate his work with Hung.)  And Slow Focus is in the same ballpark: this is of a piece with their earlier stuff, and if, like me, you were blown away by Street Horrrsing and Tarot Sport, you will get what you liked in that out of Slow Focus.<br /><br />Compared to Powers and Hung's prior albums, Slow Focus is different without being better or worse.  With Tarot Sport, Hung and Powers mixed things up by going completely instrumental.  Slow Focus changes things up again with what some have called a hip-hop sensibility.  I don't see that, and certainly there's nobody rapping here, but the all-instrumental tracks on this album do rely more heavily on percussion than the previous albums and less on variations in the noise-scape Powers and Hung create.  That caught me a little off guard, but I still liked the album enough to listen to it again almost immediately (which is rare for me) and for some of its tracks -- particularly Brainfreeze and The Red Wing -- to play in my head for the rest of the day.  I don't expect a musical act, especially a great one, to maintain its level of quality while changing its methods -- it so oftendoesn't work -- but, for the second time, Hung and Powers have managed to vary their output while maintaining their unique voice.<br /><br />Top Forty fans, if any remain in this day and age, can apply elsewhere -- despite their music's appearance in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, Hung and Powers are unlikely to break through anytime soon (nor did they ever plan on it -- look at their act's name, for heaven's sake).  But people who enjoy drone, noise, industrial, and avant-garde electronic music, and especially those who like it really loud, are going to love Slow Focus.  I hope Hung and Powers don't keep us waiting so many years for their next album.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Fun for the first two thirds and then jumps around too quickly to make much sense.  Main protagonist become unlikable by the end.  A page turner for a while though.
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|This reader is the closest to google reader that I have found, and it can use feedly as a source. The navigation seems natural to me, much more so than feedly or the other readers recommended by lifehacker and network world. And it works on the kindle fire!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I have tried many stylus that were cheaper but this one is worth the money!  The tips are soft but sturdy.

B004WY2M8I|5.0|Beautifully written amalgam of history, fantasy & philosophy. Lester is wickedly seductive, the Queen is wickedly tragic & Louis is wickedly sensitive.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I began sporadically running in Vibram Five Finger shoes in 2009 but it wasn't until this year that I became aware of the fact that (for me anyway) abandoning my Asics was the key to alleviating the pain in my left knee. Too bad I didn't know this back in the 90s, when pounding out the heel-strike miles did enough damage to my knee(s) to warrant meniscus surgery, a procedure that - by the way - didn't do much of anything to help the pain.<br /><br />This entertaining and informative book convinced me to buy a new pair of VFFs and do something I was always fearful of trying: barefoot running on the road. Beforehand, I stuck to a relatively soft &#34;rail-trail.&#34; Not any more. After reading about these amazing ultra runners, both modern Americans and the Native Americans, who cover hundreds of miles in nothing or barely anything, I headed down the asphalt for a 3-mile jaunt that felt so cool I ended up going six.<br /><br />As a former journalist, I appreciate the effort Mr. McDougall put into gathering information and presenting it in a friendly, easy-to-read and often exciting manner. However, I doubt if my friends and family are equally appreciative. I've become a pain-in-the-butt advocate of barefoot benefits!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down, a breathtaking page turner... the story engulfed you into their world where you were feeling what each character was going through. Through the laughter, the tears, the omgs, this book made you feel each emotion. A must read,and reread,read again, again, and again!!
0783233477|4.0|great movie and story line.<br /><br />Amazing actors, will recommend highly to everyone that has a pleasure for comedy and mistery
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|A great new story by the international bestseller Dan Brown.  At 670 pages long, it seems a bit daunting at first; however, it is a very quick read that is hard to put down.  Interesting that the entire novel is about just one evening, which is jam-packed with suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />Brown's novel gives us understanding of the brotherhood of the Mason's, both past and present.  It also gives some insight into God and religion, in a totally different light.  that keeps you asking questions of your own beliefs, whatever they may be.<br /><br />The story is set in Washington, D.C. and provides information about the many museums and monuments in the area.  After finishing this book, I am now interested to go and explore that area.<br /><br />Diana Young - World Traveler and #1 Amazon Best-selling author Financial Fitness For Beginners

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Timeless classic and an excellent seafaring novel.  A good book for young and old alike.  Have a great day all.
0812979656|5.0|This is literally my favorite book.  It's not exactly a feel- good book, but it's just wonderful.  I go back to it time and time again simply because I love Roy's prose.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a story! Suspenseful and well plotted tale of survival in a post-apocalyptic future.  I can't wait to read more!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I think that this game is extremely well done.  Graphics are beautiful and great work for the brain as well.  A puzzle lovers delight!
B00164KYV4|5.0|I got this for a friend of mine that could not find it anywhere.  She came to work the next day and said how much she had loved it, well known actors/actresses in it, good movie, I am told. I believe it is a love story, either way, it was a great price an was entertaining.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Awsome, the only thing missing is levity, so it is kind of a downer. The only other problem I have is that everyone seems to be headed for s bad end, but its what makes the show so engaging. Breaking Bad precurser
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This book by Aslan is well worth reading. It is scholary done, researched plentiful, and written well enough for you to finish. It is not exactly what I would believe but it is certainly well researched enough for me to enjoy this look at Jesus which is a different one from andy I have read in the past. Interesting.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms\\" and \\"Wesley's Wars\\"
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very interesting. You see the traits he had that made him so successful. Part of it was right place at the right time but he was a special person, no doubt.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|very fun and intriguing but before u know it, ur forced to pay for full version w/o getting half way through. sad and disappointing for a kid to expect a free game and end up w/ nothing:(
B001RTSPVY|4.0|One of my guilty pleasures. You keep watching, wondering if anyone will make a GOOD decision. Two down. Three to go.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I love this CD and I like the audio download that come free with it, I put the music on my i-pod and got the cd shortly after

B00499QUK2|5.0|I chose to give Sherlock Season 1 a 5 star rating simply because I couldn't stop watching it!  The writing for the series is phenomenal and it is so supremely well acted that I had to watch episode after episode.  I think that each episode was better than the one before.  The characters in the series are very well acted and kept my attention to the point that I immediately had to watch the next episode.  I highly recommend the series and I cannot wait for the next season.
0783231032|5.0|I bought this for my dad for his birthday because I remember watching it with him when my brothers and I were younger. Classic John belushi, Dan Akroyd, and even John candy stars that make this a great movie especially at this price.
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock Season 2 was given a 5 star rating because it certainly deserves it.  The 2nd season was a continuation of the relationship between Sherlock and Dr. John Watson from a new perspective not seen before.  Previous knowledge of that relationship was from a long term relationship but this series you get to see the beginning and maturation of that maturation.  Benedict Cumberbatch is just perfect in the tile role and has really opened my eyes to how wonderful of an actor he really is.  This is a great series and I cannot wait for the 3rd season to start!
B0060CXSR4|3.0|I remembered watching this movie when I was a little girl and to be honest I loved every second of it. But now that I'm older, I started retrospecting how much I used to enjoy it. As of this day I kind of like it, not as much as when I was 5 years old. I know there are some people who might think if there is any historical accuracy in this Disney movie, to a very small degree there is. But the majority of it is for pure entertainment. Did you know, and this is true but if you don't believe me ask any historian or history teacher/professor, that in real life pocahontas was just a young little girl when she first met John Smith?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. Notch u r smart for making this game. It is awesome. It rocks. I love it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins has done it again with this tour de Sigma Force book.  Complex and fast paced with his usual great plot twists and turns. Couldn't put it down.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|A professional hitman and gun specialist who calls himself Jack or Edward (George Clooney)<br />somewhat reluctantly travels to Italy for one last assignment, set up by his handler Pavel (Johan Leysen). While there he becomes emotionally involved with a prostitute, Clara (Violante Placido). He has already had to kill one of his lovers in Sweden to protect his identity and when he discovers that Clara too carries a gun in her purse, he suspects that she might be planning to kill him. However, local prostitutes have been murdered, so Jack is persuaded that Clara is carrying the gun just for protection. Jack's assignment in Italy is to build a designer rifle for Mathilde (Thekla Reuten), though Pavel has told him he will not have to do the killing himself. Only later does he discover that the intended victim of the assassination that Mathilde is planning is himself, so he makes one final, fatal adjustment to the rifle. There's not a lot of plot, but the setting is captivating, the female leads lovely, and the acting convincing. The movie was directed by Anton Corbijn.
B000E97HIA|3.0|I really like this album (heard 2 of the songs via great Prince performances on S.N.L.).  I shouldn't complain about the package, given the bargain-basement price I paid for it used (&#34;good&#34; or &#34;very-good&#34; packaging supposedly), but this CD arrived here with DEEP grooves in the front of the cardboard cover, like someone had angrily written a stabby hate-letter on paper with the album cover as makeshift blotter paper....  And there was obviously a big white sticker originally on the album cover, I had to remove its last traces because it wasn't completely removed;  dunno if the deep scratches already on it had been from some drunken owner starting to remove that same stupid white sticker with power tools?
B0098VXN2Y|5.0|As a soon to be parent, I thought this was a great movie. It found a way to tastefully cover all the different experiences couples can go through when having a baby with some comedy. I'm glad I didn't watch it before we were expecting because I wouldn't have appreciated how well put together the film was.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|Really like the movie Robert Downey was wonderful.  Him and Law work well together delivered a wonderful performance.  Looking forward to watching the next one.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Moody film, at times pretty scary, but it is a great movie. With several stories (dreams) which blend beautifully this film is very accessible for new viewers of Kurosawa.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Extremely excellent and well written book, I would recommend it for children over 10 or 11.In addition,it is a non-fiction book.However, this book also provides some information and education about geography and history.<br /><br />In conclusion, I really enjoyed reading this and I am really looking forward the next one!😃
B00005ASOI|5.0|The first on the &#34;Three Mothers&#34; trilogy it is also the most successful one. The cinematography by Luciano Tovoli is so saturated but fits perfectly with the mood of the film. This film is truly scary and Jessica Harper's casting is awesome (I loved her in Phantom of the Paradise).
B002UD56I6|5.0|It was a gift for my wife, as she is a huge MJ fan. It gets loaned out to family and friends on a regular basis. As for me, I would rather have &#34;The Greatest SuperBowls ever Played&#34;  DVD
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The coninuing saga only gets better. Could not put the book down. I am anxiously awaiting the third installment of the Trilogy.
0062255657|4.0|I was expecting this to be bad, to be honest - I've really liked all of Gaiman's books so far, and was thinking along  the lines of, 'how long can he keep this up'? But it's good again - classic Gaiman, but with an extra layer of painfully honest realism that adds a whole bunch of flavors that aren't present in his other works. Some of the material comes from his own boyhood, which also makes the book a nice puzzle - what is autobiographical and what isn't? The heart of the plot revolves around the main character having to fight off some sort of demon from another world, which made me think of the plot of Coraline quite a bit - there, too, the dark adversary character disguises herself as a good-looking, witch-like woman who plays all sorts of nasty tricks on the main character. But there was enough originality to the book to make me overlook this basic similarity.
1616551607|5.0|The Final Fantasy series has been a fairly big part of my life for the past decade, so I made my obligatory visits to fan-sites every now and again. Now, a handful of these websites had photo galleries dedicated to concept artwork, most of which was done by a Yoshitaka Amano. At first, I didn't get the fuss over this Yoshitaka Amano guy. He liked to make brunettes blond, and he thought that chocobos were pterodactyls. Everybody either wore nothing but a cape, or they had on garish motley costumes. I certainly saw the Final Fantasy quintessence embodied in my favorites, but some of them just seemed odd.<br /><br />Over the years, I started to pick up on the subtleties of Amano's works. Many of them were still, brooding, and somber; yet just as many were whimsical, vibrant, and active. But somehow, I could feel a small narrative in essentially every piece, that unmistakable Final Fantasy quality.<br /><br />When I saw this box set on Amazon for pre-order, and for a reasonable price, I figured it would be nice to own some of those drawings and paintings in real life, not in compressed .jpg format. I justified the preorder by telling myself that I could probably sell this for a lot of money in due time. Well, I don't want to sell this thing now that I have it.<br /><br />Opening up the first volume yesterday afternoon, I recognized a couple of familiar drawings. I flipped through the pages fairly quickly, until I noticed that there was a clear narrative moving along with each turn of the page. Not only had Amano documented the creative process of Final Fantasy, he was telling the game's story through his own eyes as well! I began looking at each page much more slowly, taking in the big picture as well as each individual sketch. The same as Nobuo Uematsu has defined Final Fantasy through his music, Amano truly is synonymous with the visual world of Final Fantasy. Looking through these drawings, I could see how painstakingly Square's in-game artists worked to bring Amano's visionary ideas to life with integrity and consistency.<br /><br />Throughout the first two volumes, it was amazing to watch as Amano's works became more detailed, more ornate, and more prolific for each successive installment in the series. Final Fantasy VI's section alone spanned over 100 pages! The final volume then showed a different, more experimental side of Amano, as he had been removed from his role at the creative helm, ceding to the likes of Tetsuya Nomura and Yusuke Naora (VII, VIII, and X), and Hideo Minaba (IX). Instead of creating many bright environments and characters, Amano shifted his focus to much more detailed, tender scenes, oftentimes through less traditional media like printmaking. Amano's emphasis on specific moments in Volume 3 casts a different tone than was captured in the first two books, but all paint an equally vivid narrative of the Final Fantasy series and its evolution. It's a spectacular journey!<br /><br />As for the technical details, I was surprised at how heavy the set was! I guess that's the best testament I can give to the set's durability. As others have mentioned, the outer \\"slipcase\\" is in fact an incredibly sturdy box, with an amazing cloth graphic covering the whole thing. The books themselves have nice, thick glossy paper. They are bound loosely enough that the book can be laid flat to any page but sturdily enough that pages don't feel like they'll fall out anytime soon. Perhaps the only technical complaint I have about the book is that a small number of drawings and paintings either appear to cropped to fit on a page or are magnified to take up more space. In both cases the images look slightly out of place. Overall, though, this is an incredibly detailed, faithful, and durable set. My highest recommendation both for product quality and for content.<br /><br />Also of note: Amazon packs this thing as if it were as fragile as an egg! I'm very impressed and thankful for the care that went into a safe delivery.s visionary ideas to life with integrity and consistency.<br /><br />Throughout the first two volumes, it was amazing to watch as Amano's works became more detailed, more ornate, and more prolific for each successive installment in the series.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed watching it with my daughter and our friends. We discuss it and speculate about their future plans. It is fun.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Acting was great but too many jumps from place to place, and storyline to storyline which required too much focus to just sit back and enjoy a good movie.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Highly recommend this.  Have used this before on other systems,  always dependable.  Needed it for my Samsung Galaxy, had no problem with download or install.  Gets the job done.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There are some books that I appreciate for the characters, some books that I appreciate for the plots, and some books that I appreciate for the worlds therein.  However, there are very few books that are just stunning in what they are.  The Book Thief is one such book.<br /><br />Though the summary of this tale may say that it is simply a story about a girl who steals books during WWII, it is ever so much more.  It somehow notes the sadness of the insignificant; bittersweet notes of a story that some may never know.  It's a story about what happens when chaos becomes the norm.  One of the most thought-provoking quotes from the book that accurately sums up its theme, in my opinion, is when Death notes that, \\"I guess humans like to watch a little destruction.  Sand castles, houses of cards, that's where they begin.  Their greatest skill is their capacity to escalate.\\"  And escalate they do.  Above all, this story demonstrates the resilience of a human heart, how we can lose everything and still find something to hold on to.  In our protagonist's case, it's words.  As she watches her world fall apart, she fights back with words: the most powerful things she owns.<br /><br />Please, I beg of you, read this book.  It's bittersweet and beautiful.  One that you'll never forget.  It hits home the timeless message that, no matter the state of destruction around us, we will always find some shred of hope to hold onto.  No matter what.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I have been looking for a photo editor compatible with my Kindle Fire HD.<br />This afternoon I found this application which includes a camera, color management, crop capability, edge softening, framing and other editing that I have not had time to explore. It was so easy that I cropped, shaped and corrected lighting on several photos already in my Kindle, took a few more with the included camera, then posted them directly to my Facebook in a matter of minutes. There is no need for a lengthy instruction book or reading for hours first. It was so EASY to use immediately. I HIGHLY recommend this camera and photo editing app. Don't wait, you will not regret this purchase for a Kindle Fire HD.
0345505387|5.0|For anyone immersed in the Outlander world, this is fun, fun, fun.  It presents events from a slightly different viewpoint than that of Claire without changing the (complicated) story line.  Good visualization of characters
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the game very much.  Please bring new levels. It took me a few hours to complete these. I would recommend to my friends.
193700788X|5.0|I have all her Sookie Stackhouse books in the series and I love every single one them. I have all the True Blood series that is out on DVD too. I loved the books with a passion and I'm sure anyone who loves a love story & vampires will love these books too.
0743289692|5.0|Hirsi Ali describes her life in unsparing detail.  It's not a pretty picture, but it resonates her humanity and her strength in confroning the horrendous problems with which she dealt bravely.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|If I had to choose the definitive artistic work of my generation<br />This album would be present. I would also have Beethovens ninth symphony,<br />The Beatles Abbey Road, Stan Getz with Astrid....Ipenema...Of course Jimi<br />at Woodstock....janis at monterey....Rachmaninov....2nd Piano Concerto....<br />I also like Wille Nelson Stardust album...and the Carpenters Christmas...<br />eclectic....Oh I like the insanity of Picasso......John
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun,  and great to play anytime you're bored. This game is perfect for the fans of the movie! But quick question; how do I beat Meena? I keep trying but I just can't!
B00006JI11|1.0|I only said hate because it did not work. I am in the process of contacting the buyer. As long as they make good on it I am satisfied. They cannot help for a product not working, that happens sometimes. I hope the procedure to rectify the problem goes smoothly.
B0041D843M|5.0|If you care about your health, this is the best book you could ever read. The changes in My weight, energy level, and overall health are amazing.
1490313370|5.0|&#34;Choose yourself&#34; good title . Its important for people to concentrate their energy on things they can control and don't waste energy on things that can't be controlled.  Don't try to control others control your own mind.
145162607X|3.0|While Philippa Gregory as usual has done her homework for the novel, I was not particularly taken with her portrayal of Anne Neville.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Pros:<br />- Looks like a direct port from console/pc.<br />- Graphical quality is comparable.<br />- Excellent design of touchscreen functionality.<br />- I can play MTG on my phone!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very buggy (Samsung Note 2), see below.<br />- Buttons are sometimes unresponsive to taps.<br />- Close up cards (viewing, dealing damage) can get stuck if system messages pop up.<br />- Both bugs mentioned usually require you to force close the app.<br />- Device back button sometimes does not function.<br /><br />If not for the bugs would rate 5 stars.
B0083I90HU|5.0|A very interesting story although it starts slow....then it's hard to put down.<br />Although it is fiction, you can feel the pain.
B00CKQ1092|5.0|D.E.P has been one of my top three favorite bands since I randomly bought their Miss Machine album back in high school and this release did not let me down completely. I think this is the weakest album they have put out in years, in terms of memorable tracks, but the album is rock solid regardless. The other D.E.P albums lived in my player for months after their release being played daily on repeat without getting tiresome to me, this album does click with me as well, and that is primarily due to the lack of awesome melodic hooks, but ITS D.E.P they rule, buy it, love it, or don't love it whatever just buy it.
B000KIRT6A|5.0|Exactly what I needed for my modified EPI Valve Jr head. Made a world of difference. A little noisy if you crank the treble too much but I've never owned any brand that wasn't. Good solid EQ at a great price
B0016OOS16|2.0|Does not work well with the Mac. Driver is not well supported and does not start when applications start. Get the driver issues fixed and this would be a 4 star device (only 4 because it is a bit tricky to differentiate between some of the motions when it does work).
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Movie was great. For this movie and many other Amazon steam, with Comcast (25mb/s) ,Android razr, much lag last half of movie. Netflix steam works great..
B0018O4YT0|3.0|I liked the original theatre release better. Sometimes they should just leave things alone. Some of the cuts took away from the continuity of the film.
B000IDEORY|5.0|My husband and I love this movie.Were both in or middle 70 and order this movie .We both injoy it and love the dancing.Sad that some of the people or not here.But we love it everytime .
B0028KF4ME|5.0|I didn't think I would like a serial killer series but it is addicting.  Watch it from the beginning and you will get hooked as well.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I love this show. Been enjoying it for the second time and my 10 year old son told me he loves it too.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I got this to use my school book on the tablet, it keeps crashing while reading the school book, OK with just reading novels
B009O2XY12|4.0|would be nice if you could win extra credits to 'buy' extra lifes or balls. I don't want to pay for it
B009JBZH54|5.0|The package arrived in time and as promised in great condition. I experienced no issues so far. The movies themselves are great as well:)
B005544V6A|5.0|Very smart, quick, and witty. My wife and I have both been enjoying it. Has a bit of White Collar feel to it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most of my female friends and a few of my male friends urged me to watch this.  At first i thought it was another british soap opera and it is in a fashion. But after a few shows and some online checking i found it to be very correct in showing just how life was in the early 1900's in Britain.  Watch the Crowly family cope with life that includes how their huge estate will be handed down, WW1, severents and each other.  I too will join the huge tsunami of people that will urge you to give it a try.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I overall enjoy the game. The minions just crack me up. Great fun just watching them scream or taking out the other minions. It's easy to play and addictive although very difficult to earn coins. You get one coin for every 3 missions or so you complete, or if you get lucky can pick one  up on your run. There was quite a few missions geared towards adding friends..beating friends scores etc. Which I find annoying being as I myself hate getting invited to games or my FB posts being inundated with them. I hate the fact that sharing is part of missions. Even with all that it's terribly addictive...I find myself just running to challenge my previous scores or banana catching records seeing how long I can dodge obstacles.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|\\"Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" is based on one concept that you will find either interesting or silly. That is, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton), now grown up, make a living as witch hunters in some alternate medieval universe, where Famke Janssen is a big bad witch planning to do something very evil.<br /><br />Because of the film's thin plotline, we are not allowed to know who these siblings are or what they really want to do. Hansel and Gretel are determined to eliminate all the witches because, well, those witches are bad, aren't they? Peter Stormare, typecast as always, is a corrupt sheriff.<br /><br />With this setting and casting, \\"Hansel & Gretel\\" is meant to be (campy) fun, which it is not, because of the heavy-handed direction from Tommy Wirkola. Here is a great material for fun movie, but, like in his \\"Dead Snow,\\" a Norwegian horror comedy about undead German soldiers, the director fails to fully develop the potential of the film.<br /><br />What we get here is so-so action sequences that are enjoyable and forgettable. The leading players Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton look fine, but they deserve a much better story.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am by no means an expert in Romantic Novels, but another Gideon and Eva book... that's just fine by me!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|After looking for an escape game I came across this. I wasn't convinced after the room, but quickly got hooked.
B005F3XV62|5.0|We all had so much fun watching this hilarious film.  The adults were cracking up laughing harder than the young ones.  A true family entertainment to enjoy together.
B00932A3SK|5.0|A progressive sequence of events keeps the action going.  This Norwegian thriller has some common themes with the &#34;Girl who&#34; series.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Very intriguing and had to read it everyday to see how it would end. Was not disappointed at all!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very addictive and challenging. Fun to play. Entertaining graphics, sounds are awesome. Constantly working to improve personal score an performance. Highly recommend this game to others.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I  was in the middle of the book and seriously considering switching to a new read . The historical accuracy of the orphanage bits  rang horribly true as they should. But I was looking for a lie in my hammock summer read, and this was a downer. BUT STICK. TO THE END!  Yes! Rose prattles on,and it seem we have to wait an eternity for anything good to come into Jaime\\"s life.  Looking back, I think McKenna nailed her pacing and character development. In the end, I got just what I was looking for<br />and more!
B004SIP8OI|2.0|The package I got for this dvd right here was all torn up. The plastic cover was scratched and seemed like it went threw something. and inside there were broken pieces of the bluray case which is not what makes me happy about that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much ,so addictive. I love being able to pick out and buy so many horses.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I haven't viewed it yet so I am unable to review it.  I hope it lives up to Phantom of the opera
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This book really opens your eyes. It allows you to think of the precious memories in your life, and think of the precious memories that will never happen in someone else's. I am a freshman in high school reading this book for a project for school. The only con to this book is that it is very boring. Shins life was not boring, but the information about north Korea was.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|A quality movie  Its nice to see some of the older stars doing their thing. A touching story. Older folks will enjoy this also
B003P4MV0A|5.0|Brilliant author. Extraordinary account of historic event. Not afraid to be severely criticized for her opinions. I will read more of her<br />work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun app and the right price.  Watch out for in game expenses they can rack up if you aren't watching.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|im not much of a gamer but i really like this game it will give you hours of fun different vehicles make it really nice each one has its own advantages on different courses
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game became my new addiction from the moment I first played it. My six year old loves it too.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book is long on &#34;I'm a doctor so you have to believe me&#34; and short on what he experienced.  Pretty well written but it just drones on and on about his brain death caused by his illness, his subsequent recovery, and how he's a neurosurgeon of neurosurgeons so he knows what he's talking about.  I believe his story but it's as wordy as thus review.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What possessed Fox to cancel this EXCELLENT piece of SciFi. Truly excellent with a great cast of people you care about - a very important consideration.<br /><br />No question 10/10.<br /><br />There must be more programmes like this out there - recommendations via comments please.....
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Enjoyable, it was a little long but the story was not as bad as the last film. Three more words...
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I decided to watch this because I'm into the mid-evil era. Great way to watch history and others things. Love it.
B003KGBISY|4.0|There are many scenes that remind me of a Western.  Some of the samurai have hyperbolic emotions and lots of male crying.  I understand this was a different time and showing this type of emotion for this culture is a way to progress the story/character.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, but the essays provided by Criterion really help you understand the plot, the director, and influences better.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|Of course the 1st movie is better. It was not what I expected but at least I able to watch it with any problems.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great tool to sort, arrange and remove programs from your kindle fire android.  A convenient way to keep your kindle fire in order.
0439023483|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the flattest books I have ever read. While my 12 year old daughter loves it, I would recommend other books over it anytime.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I bought this album after previewing the tracks on my Spotify subscription. I always support great music and this is definitely a great album.
0544104404|3.0|Interesting book, many people are aware that standardized tests and the like don't indicate much and divert children and teachers from the learning and discovery that could be going on.  Peter Sacks considers standardized tests a form of intellectual and emotional abuse [[ASIN:0738204331 Standardized Minds: The High Price Of America's Testing Culture And What We Can Do To Change It]].<br />Similarly, children are being intellectually and emotionally abused by much of our corporate media and the marketers that use various techniques to influence the psyches of children.  As junk food harms their bodies, junk media harms the minds of kids [[ASIN:B009M6FPWG Consuming Kids,The Commercialization of Childhood]].<br />I think the author could've spent more time on how many problems, for both children and adults, stem from our society being dominated by transnational corporate interests.  With no sense of shame, there are employees of marketing firms that boast of their ability to influence the minds of kids even before they can speak, and to cultivate a \\"nag factor\\" to get children to pressure their parents on consumer decisions.  It's all rather demented, but true, and spelled out in this riveting documentary, [[ASIN:B0007DBJM8 The Corporation]].<br />Kids these days, growing up in a world of bought politicians and a devastated environment are going to need plenty of grit just to survive.  Tough has made some contributions to that end.  I'd also recommend the work of Alfie Kohn [[ASIN:0618001816 Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes]], Richard Louv [[ASIN:156512605X Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children From Nature-Deficit Disorder]], and the excellent magazine \\"for girls and their dreams\\" [[ASIN:B001E547FE New Moon Girls]].<br />We should also think critically about the powerful drugs that Big Pharma has been pushing on parents and children on a massive scale [[ASIN:0738205443 Talking Back to Ritalin: WhatDoctors Aren't Telling You About Stimulants and ADHD]].
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Very enjoyable book,  looking forward the the next book in this collection, have become totally involved with the characters.and their many trials
B009HUB40Y|1.0|The game tends to freeze not allowing you to make your moves. Beheaded is way better and worth the cost.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|Love Dr. John.  Another great CD demonstrating his awesome music.  Easy to see why it won the Grammy.  I do miss hearing the fabulous trombone work of Sarah Morrow
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I started watching the show after season 1 & 2 were over, but I am totally hooked on the Specter/Ross combo.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Being a fan of the Alien Series ..this was a no brainer..<br /><br />movie wise no issues...<br /><br />Getting the 3d Blu-ray to work on my Asus G55VW ..was a nightmare..getting the digitial copy as well....since i am not from the states..cannot stream movies off any of the services provided...now need to figure out the secon screen app and getting it to sync to my phone...sigh..
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I think the reputation and fame of this series speaks for itself. I love this series. The combination of action, romance, and the supernatural is all you could ask for from a series of its kind. I cannot wait for the last installment or for the movie adaptations to come out!!
1565847032|5.0|A well-researched, well-documented historical account of the use of unfettered American military and economic power to extend military and economic control over much of the world, to a large extent without the knowledge and/or support of the American people.<br /><br />This book is required reading for any responsible American.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it kept me thinking the whole time. Thank you for making this game. Just let me know when you have more levels please.
0553801503|5.0|I am listening to it on Audible … but having the hardbound books for my collection is still a great idea.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Very interesting look at how tangled a web can become when just one decision is made, when another decision was possible and would have likely led to something else entirely. Masterfully links the lives of the various characters--kept me reading.
0553801473|5.0|On Audible. When all power goes out like in the TV series Revolution, I will still have five great books to keep me company.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|honeslty i love all of his books they are my favourite... recommend everyone to read ... A+++ all the way
0553108034|5.0|Epic epic. It's so much richer than the TV series, as most books are than their movie version. I just wish the author didn't have to kill everyone after we get to love them. Ooops. Spoiler alert.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|At a time when Hollywood and the American film industry in general has been busy churning out mindless, violent drivel, unoriginal remakes and endless sequel after sequel, \\"Return of the Son of Die Hard Part 14\\", or Disney's coming attraction, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow's Bold Escape from Assisted Living\\", it is a pleasure to watch films as creative and original as, \\"Cloud Atlas\\". I understand that Hollywood now uses software to dream up plot lines that tend to make money. This film plays contrary to that concept with no less than 6 separate story lines and challenging the talented cast by making them preform in multiple character rolls that span centuries and even play different genders and ethnicities. If I recollect correctly I believe I counted Tom Hanks acting as six characters.<br /><br />The cast does an outstanding job delivering depth and freshness to each character in each story line. And such a fantastic story! There are previous reviews stating that the film was too difficult to follow. It is indeed a complicated plot that is also time consuming at 172 minutes but it keeps you riveted and interested as one starts getting involved enough to note where the separate story lines cross and and the message, and it is an important message for our world too, starts becoming clear. Unlike the garbage that most film studios turn out today - there actually is something to be learned from this film. I won't ruin it for the reader of this review by revealing what that message is - watch the movie and find out for yourself.<br /><br />Even though it has been rated \\"R\\" this film maybe appropriate for viewing by mature teens. There is some nudity and mature subject matter.<br /><br />Peace - EV
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|About the most powerful, gripping, and engrossing war film ever--and that's despite Marlon Brando nearly ruining it all at the end. If you want to see the absurdity, chaos, confusion, waste, and utter mess that war truly is, definitely check this out.

0061124958|5.0|My book arrived quickly and in flawless condition. I am so happy it did. Such a fantastic tale. I am reading it now to my 4 year old and she is loving it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book especially if you've read the first one. I can't wait to see the movie that is coming out in September!!!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Hate is a strong word, but I have to say I really disliked this movie.  I found it utterly boring and almost left the theater.  I had to make myself sit and watch the rest of the movie, just to make sure nothing unique and interesting happened that remotely lived up to the hype. I was predicting the next scenes throughout almost the entire movie, and even the next lines at times.  I understand and support what Abrams was trying to do with the franchise, and I'm not ruined on Star Trek, but this movie was very, very disappointing to me.
0307341577|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. Mostly, I thought the character development was pretty amazing. The characters are quirky and a bit difficult to fully understand, which makes them more realistic. Also, the prose was highly engaging. I did not feel like my intelligence was being underestimated when I read this novel. I intend to read more from Ms. Flynn.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is very well written.  It is sad but sweet.  You do not have to be a teenager to enjoy this book.  The characters are so interesting.  My heart just broke for the parents.  I couldn't imagine what they were going through.  I would recommend this book to anyone!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Love the characters,  Harvey can't stand to lose. Glad to see Mike & Rachel together again.  Can't wait to see what will happen next
B000LPS4BG|5.0|The movie is great for anyone that has not seen it. In the extras there is an interview with the Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta and an option to play the movie with Henry Hill and the fed that set him up in witness protection narrating throughout the movie together. EPIC.
0385121679|5.0|This was a great story about madness and psychological terror, created by one of the best storytellers of all time. It has a really awesome storyline that Ive come to love throughout the years. In my opinion I didn't find it SCARY. Although there were some parts that got a little bit eerie. But other than that, not really. Now other people might beg to differ. That's my opinion on the scare value in this novel.<br /><br />Really great read and I totally recommend it!
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Just watched the movie I enjoyed it as much as I did the book.  Books are always better and The Host while It seemed to drag on forever, it was worth following through to the end.  The movie engendered the same peaceful, warm feeling as the book.  It wound through a myriad of situations and is a tribute to the human spirit.  Of course I always love anything where there is resistance and rebellion and the humans succeed in the end...I will read the whole book and suffer through the entire series or movie with all of its confusing intricacies to get to the fighting back and the win.  While there are a couple of romances and lots of romantic angst in The Host.  If you are looking for adventure and violence or blood and gore you find less in the movie than in the book and there is not a lot there.  The setting is very interesting, and there is a lot of food for thought regarding if there is other life out there watching humanity destroying ourselves and our planet from the inside out; what do they think?
B00B7Y0206|5.0|When I couldn't watch YouTube.com any more on my kindle, I tried to look for YouTube.com apps. I found this and it let me watch the videos I wanted. Works with any thing on YouTube.com.I truly recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Great! I would tell anyone to get this. You can look just about everything and anything up on it. Very fun
B000QUUD60|2.0|Too much footage of crowds and distraction from his singing.  Would prefer a DVD that shows Elvis only singing in concert.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Clever and appeals to all! Great app that keeps getting better! For free?!? Let's gets some more of that going on!
0307341550|2.0|I read so many good reviews about this book that I wanted to see what the fuss was about. This book disappointed me. It started out good then lost track. It seemed to jump all over the place. the so called twist was predictable. I wanted so much more from it but it let me down. I didn't mind the gothic style or the gruesome details about the murders. That didn't bother me at all.
1439153663|5.0|Loved the book and just wanted to add my 5 stars. Read this book in one night and wished there was more.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have deleted and redownloaded this app 4 times. It works a few times and then suddenly when I click on a book all I get is a black screen. Once again no books will load... So so sick of trying to relax and read a book! Frustrated because I have a lot of purchased books and no way to read them. Please just fix this issue!!!!!!!!!!!
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|CD was shipped in a timely fashion and overall sound quality is very good. Unfortunately, at least one song, \\"I want you so bad\\" ends before the end.....about 5-10 seconds of the song are cut-off.<br /><br />Otherwise, great Beatles songs at a good price.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|After 6 or so years of not playing, this game has gotten me back into MTG. Love playing with premade decks and being able to do sealed packs is very cool.
B008Y76VW2|3.0|What you have here is a classic drama mixed with a coming of age story.<br /><br />High school kids transitioning into college after the summer. Dealing with relationships with: the opposite sex, parents, co-workers, and people of various ages. This movie focus' on the relationship with the opposite sex with main characters.<br /><br />In short I thought this movie would have been funnier...I don't know if it was the title or the movie cover.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My granddaughter and I completed all 10 levels in about a day. We can't wait for more! thanks.. but hurry!!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|How can you go wrong with Tommy Lee Jones and John  Goodman? Definitely a good watch. Lots of action. I picked it out and even the guys in my house watched and enjoyed the whole movie.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I have a &#34;thing&#34; about tigers!, so as soon as I heard that this movie had a tiger as one of the &#34;main characters&#34;, I had to get it. I was very touched by the story and tho I only got it a short time ago, I have already watched it 3 times. I think the graphics and the COLORS were brilliant, but the story itself keeps me coming back. I compare this with &#34;Cast Away&#34;...some may say that it is a slow going movie, but seriously.........if you are shipwrecked by plane or by boat on a desert island or in the middle of the vast ocean in a tiny boat...for several months or years....TIME DRAGS!  It just helps us appreciate the things we have and enjoy in our lives.
B000WLTEGS|5.0|I bought this album the first day it came out. I've always loved it. I just bought a digital copy. I still love it.
B008H04T84|5.0|I really love this book! I had to read it for a gov/econ class this year, and it's very eye-opening. I love the stories that Mycoskie put in about companies other than his own that were innovative and successful, and it's quite an inspirational book as well. It's a quick read, but there are loads of things I highlighted that were either very interesting or useful/important to know.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It will help the players to practice before go into other angry birds games. love it so go for it beginners
B006GWO5NE|5.0|After having trouble charging me Kindle with the power cord it came with, Amazon replaced it free of charge. No problems since.
B00B6CQIO8|5.0|The acting and story line are really great. Worth purchasing.  Look forward to future seasons and plan on buying them as well.
0307383415|5.0|I enjoyed the book greatly and passed it on to many friends. Obama is a good orator and a good author as well, It provides a look into his background.
B001GCUNW6|4.0|This movie was ordered by my daughter who found it very funny. It is recommended for kids of all ages.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like this app for the fact that you don't miss the things you do like on the regular app. It doesn't push out notifications though so I actually use both.
141694737X|5.0|This is one of our all time favorites.  We've got 4 girls -- twin 5 year olds, a 3 year old and now a 8 month old.  They all have loved this book very much.  Would recommend to start using this book with babies early on.  At around 10-12 months, it ended up becoming a &#34;must read every day&#34; staple.  It's great for those who want to do sign language with their kids too, as you can use sign for elephant, lion, etc. The kids love opening the flaps.  Would definitely highly recommend this book!!
B00886184A|5.0|Being a fan of Gentle Giant it was nice to be able to get this cd.I was happy with the price.
B00005JL78|5.0|First off, when I order this movie brand new from Amazon.com, they told me that the movie would arrive in a normal postal time of 3-5 business days.  It arrives in two days after I made the order.  Thank you Amazon, you guys never quit when it comes to good quality, postal service.<br /><br />  &#34;Minority Report&#34;, Directed by Steven Spielberg, is an amazing portrayal of author Philip K. Dick's short story.  Unlike &#34;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&#34;  A tremendous look into the future where murder is stopped before it happens.  Tom Cruise, &#34;John Anderton&#34; plays the part of a cop from the department of Precrime.  The department of Precrime, is run by viewing the visions from the Precognitives.  The &#34;Precogs&#34; can see the vision of a future murder waiting to happen.  John Anderton &#34;Tom Cruise&#34; analyzes the visions by knowing Location, victim, perpetrator, time and date of the crime.<br />  Eventually John Anderton finds himself being a part of a murder to a man he has never meat before in his life.  John ends up going on the run from Precrime as they attempt to arrest John, due to the fact of the visions of the Precogs being so perfect.<br />  John ends up meeting up with the man, and kills him; by accident though.  John also ends up finding a flaw in the system or what Philip K. Dick calls, the Minority Report, where the system is said to be so perfect that unbeknownst to the operators that the system is infact human; and when it's human there's a flaw no matter how perfect the system is.<br /><br />  Spielberg wanted this movie to be like &#34;A.I Artificial Intelligence&#34; but unlike Ai's warm color hue to the movie, Spielberg made the color hue for &#34;Minority Report&#34; to be  a span of cooler colors using blues and whites.  Spielberg wanted these colors to give a much colder prospect, since Minority Report has a much colder and darker story to the evolution of technology, and the flaws that it possesses.<br /><br />  Remember something very clear that, this movie does possess language, and one small brief 20 second scene with sexual content.  Spielberg normally does not allow any of that content in his films unless it's absolutely necessary.  In this case it indeed was.  During the search for John Anderton, Precrime ends up finding out his current location at an apartment complex.  Some of the officers unleash &#34;Spiders&#34; which are tiny little robots that search the building the for the suspect by scanning their eyes.  The spiders ends up going into each and every room, scanning all of the eyes of the individuals of the building.  Eventually the spiders come across a couple on a bed.  Anyway, Spielberg wanted this particular scene in the movie, to make a point in the movie, where technology had evolved to the point where it can invade our personal lives and affairs, and that we will never be able to hide from it; if it continues to evolve the way it is.<br /><br />  The movie is in a nutshell a great action movie, with a great story, and a great message.<br />  &#34;In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king.&#34;something very clear that, this movie does possess language, and one small brief 20 second scene with sexual content.

I got a couple extra copies for the cat-owning members of my family for Christmas, and they loved it too!
B00BQHA06A|4.0|This is not HIM's best album but, it's still pretty good. The album is not as structured as their other ones. It is worth a listen if you are a HIM fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is amazing its a great game for building whatever you imangination tells you to I recomend this game to anyone who likes building things .
B000VZIOCK|5.0|This is a Queens of the Stone Age at it's best. I love this album. They rock out through the whole thing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|the game is just as good or probably better than temple run 2 BUT, I CANNOT connect to facebook, i tried tens of times and and it has failed. i have the kindle fire tanlet edition, the only one available to download on amazon.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|This is a very good album. The songs are written very well. The lyrics are great. The music sounds great. Classic HIM.
B00C2IN7EE|5.0|This was an excllent movie, easier to follow what was happening than the first movie with Jude Law and  Iron Man Downey.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I love love love all the MIB movies! It is very hard for me to choose a favorite, but this might be it. All 3 made me laugh, but this one might have made me laugh a little bit more. Definitely worth watching over and over again!
0399255370|5.0|Wonderful book! Great illustrations, my daughter loves it! Recommended read for children and parents. This book is quite amusing as well.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Didn't like that you have to be on the internet to play the game and you only get so many levels a week.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|The object of this game is to tag as many trains as you can while outrunning the law.  The avatar's and trinkets you get for points are barely clothed.  Sorry, seems a bit short on end result.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|A lot of levels and challenges. The game works well. Wish it explained more what the charecters do, but overall a fun game. No internet required.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I will admit I did not expect much of this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Tom Cruise is better in this role than he ever was in Mission Impossible.  I hope they make a series of these movies.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Finally no stupid wires in the way.  I also programmed the middle macro key to run an autohotkey script to change the default sound device, so I don't have to screw around with clicking through the sound options in windows when I want to switch between my speakers and headset.  I chose to override the default behavior of the middle one because it mutes the mic, which can easily be accomplished by swinging the mic up.<br /><br />It's also nice that you don't have to stop using them to charge them, just plug in the charge cable.<br /><br />And finally, the range is incredible.  I can go from my room to the kitchen downstairs, with my door closed, and still get great sound quality.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|Great movie. It's interesting how acting has changed over the years.  I love time period movies and this is one to watch.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have some issues with this book because I have a son that's two and it kinda freaked me out, so I love this book but if you have soft feelings for kids then you should probably not read it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I went to the beach and forgot my book, and that's how it started and I can't stop. After reading the reviews on Amazon I didn't look back. I love science fiction so I'm a bit biased, but Hugh Howey wrote an excellent story and I couldn't stop reading. To Mr. Howey, thank you!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love all of her books and personally was a bit sad after finishing this knowing their will be no more sookie books.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Like Coraline for adults. This book is short and very sweet. If you're a fan of Gaiman or magical realism, this is a must-read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fans of the minions will enjoy this cute, well-designed game. The graphics are sharp and the game itself moves quickly and smoothly.
0345529057|5.0|Great books. Great series, I really enjoyed them as I hoped. If you like fantasy reads you should love these books.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|. About 1/2 hour too long.<br />. Special effects:  Not that special.<br />. Tom Cruise:  Aaargh.  Repulsive as ever.<br /><br />Entertaining farce with some good action.<br /><br />Overall:  better than MI III (That's not saying much.).  Pass it by.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Occasional eye candy from a couple of the main characters. Cool technology even if it's not entirly believable. Actually has a storyline.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I travel a lot and always take  my Kindle for watching movies on the plane. Because of Alarm Clock. Xtreme I have no need to take an alarm clock too. It works great, is easy to use, and I love of. It has never let me down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game but its way too short! I want more!!! make some more levels please! so addictive. everyone should try it out!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie is very funny for children an adults alike. The minions are absolutely fantastic. Good to watch as a family film
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book made total sense to me.<br />I love the explanations that the author gives, and it also makes you think about where you come from, and why you behave the way you do.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is freaking great I love it and it was so worth the down load and waiting. I'm glad
B000H6SXMY|4.0|The DVD's are great over all. A few of them stop once in a while but if you fast forward a little it fixes it.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Love Audrey Hepburn in this movie. Quite funny! I did get this to watch with my girls but it was a little difficult for them to understand. They enjoyed it anyway with my explanations.
B003QS67F0|5.0|My two oldest daughters watched this with my wife and myself and loved it. It's even better the second time you watch it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoyed my recent book Dairy of a wimpy kid 7 it was very good and funny! :-) Jeff Kinney is a talented writer.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I believe Gotye has a couple of hits in this album, but there are also a number of duds.  It is worth adding to your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game that I have ever known. My friend told me about this game 2 years ago and I am happy I bought it in the app store. If it reading this please buy this game.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Why do I say it is science fiction drama at its best?  Because there is just enough drama to interest my wife, but a whole lot more science fiction to keep my attention.  Aliens, spaceships, futuristic robots and weapons!  Oh yeah!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A combination of wonderful fantasy layered with unforgettable characters.  I did not want this book to end.  Remember how you felt when you first saw The Wizard of Oz, or read The BFG?  That's what it felt like.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|This case works just fine. It's padded so if you drop it with the Kindle, no damage. It's just the right size so it's not bulky. Fits in my glove compartment no problem.
1885167776|5.0|I don't normally care to take the time to write reviews, but a family member gave this book to me to read after some lengthy conversations we had about recent developments in my business, and I'm glad that he did.<br /><br />So often we are distracted by things that are urgent and not important, among other things.  This book offers insight and excellent tips on how to focus in, and concentrate on The One Thing that would make a difference in your work life, personal life, health, etc.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|I was having a hard time reading the book. The movie was really captured the book and I really liked the story thus the reason it's a classic.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|Short book with really abrupt ending. I feel like I wasted my time reading this. I wish it had a few more chapters for the price I paid.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|I think this movie was OK. My husband and I like Arnold Schwarzenegger so we wanted to watch it. It was so OK that I barely remember it anymore.
B001XUH69Y|2.0|Maybe I started the movie too late into the evening, but my daughter and I found this film put us to sleep before the movie was halfway through.

B0083GQKQG|3.0|This film was interesting as it kept me wondering where the story line was going.  Tilda Swinton played the role of mother and was very convincing as the super-supportive mom of a real screwed-up kid.  Kevin was so naughty and since watching this movie I've renamed my naughty black cat Kevin.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So I bought one of these for every TV in my apartment and I have to say setup was incredibly easy and I've been loving it so far.  So right now it seems like there aren't many applications that work with it, but a) the most important apps do (Netflix, Google, Pandora and Youtube) and b) this is like the first few days it's available so I have no doubt many more apps will follow suit.<br /><br />For all of you out there saying your built in TV functionality can do the same thing, I disagree... well unless you have Google.  I have built in functionality and internet in all my TVs (none are Google) and I have found them slow, they crash, and the music support is terrible.  This system allows me to stream all my music I have in Google Play, which honestly might be the best feature, plus it really does give me the interface I want for using things like Netflix and Youtube.  I can be playing something while searching for other things, which is nice and not possible on any native TV applications.  I know with the PS3 version of youtube you can do this through your phone, but I've found tons of problems with that and this seems to work perfectly.<br /><br />Lastly, this thing is so unobtrusive.  Yes, you do have to plug it into both HDMI and USB on your TV, and I wish you didn't, but that's not really Google's fault... had TV companies had the foresight to build power into HDMI you wouldn't.  I imagine in the future some companies will if these things catch on.  It's awesome and I love it.  I'm going to buy another just to keep on me when I'm out and I want to broadcast something at a friends house who is a little behind the technological curve.
0062235893|1.0|The description included a pair of bunny slippers which it did not come with. The book was cheesy and so not worth it without the slippers
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, lots of action.  If you been an Arnold fan from the 80's you might wanna see a bit more from this movie but i think its awesome.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I loved the movie and now the book. This book explains a lot of things that I didn't understand in the movie. I must now see the movie again to see if it will make sense.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Mists of Avalon and I agree that the Goddess is with us today.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|If you are feeling the need for some action, then this is definitely the movie.  The story was a little predictable but i still enjoy the movie love the action.
B00005JLEX|5.0|The kids have been watching various episodes on TBS but never in sequence. Pulled the trigger and started them off right. Just purchased season three and they are already watching it!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|If you are a person who likes to relax and watch a movie without the class room attention, you may have a bit of problem with this one.  I didn't really enjoy the format of the movie but its ok.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Good movie! Lots of twists and turns. Anthony Hopkins is great as usual. Definitely worth the money to buy and watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best book I've read in a while!! A must for scifi fans. Buy it you can thank me later! Do it.
B00846REIS|5.0|***Spoilers***<br /><br />I've read all three books back to back and am having a hard time keeping the details contained to each individual book.<br /><br />***You've been warned***There are spoilers***<br /><br />Bared to You by Sylvia Day is a steamy, dramatic, romantic tale of a mega rich alpha male and his obsession with the new girl in the building. She's damaged, he's damaged, they are both VERY dysfunctional AND high-maintenance and yet you will find yourself rooting for them to be able to work it out. This first book alludes to the childhood trauma that Gideon has suffered and goes into detail with Eva's past.<br />An ex-fiancee shows up from Gideon's past, completely blindsiding Eva who never even knew he had been engaged. Jealousy plays a huge part in their misunderstandings and problems. Eva's best friend, a gorgeous male model named Cary, also has a tragic past but is the rock Eva leans on. Cary has a meltdown in the form of an orgy and it puts Eva in danger and then Gideon flies in to the rescue, fists flying *sigh* !<br /><br />Audible Audiobook \\"Review: Crossfire # 1: Bared To You\\"<br />Where does Bared to You rank among all the audiobooks you've listened to so far?<br />Bared to you ranks among my favorite of all the audiobooks I've listened to so far and I've listened to a VERY large quantity of audiobooks since I began my Audible membership in October 2008.<br /><br />What was one of the most memorable moments of Bared to You?<br />The scene in the library where Gideon and Eva are interrupted, first by Magdalena and then by Christopher.<br />\\"A movement on the far side of the room caught my eye and I froze, my gaze locking with Magdalene's. She stood just inside the door, halted midstride, staring wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the back of Gideon's moving head.\\"<br /><br />Eva almost revels in the feeling of exhibitionism and ownership when she realizes Magdalena is watching and returns her focus to Gideon, then disregarding the other woman. Then they are interrupted AGAIN by Christopher but are situated so that he can't see what is going on underneath Eva's skirts - and there is A LOT going on under there!<br />\\"I climaxed. Afraid of the wail of pleasure that wanted out of me, I sank my teeth into Gideon's hard pectoral. He grunted softly and started coming, his cock jerking as it pumped thick spurts of scorching semen into me.<br />The rest of the conversation was lost beneath the roar of my blood. Christopher said something, Gideon replied, and then the door shut again. I was lifted to sit on the armrest and Gideon started thrusting between my spread thighs, using my body to rub out the rest of his orgasm, growling in my mouth as we finished off the rawest, most exhibitionistic sexual encounter of my life.\\"<br /><br />Definitely one of my more favorite moments *sigh*!<br /><br />Have you listened to any of Jill Redfield's other performances before?<br />How does this one compare?<br />This is the first time I have listened to a performance by Jill Redfield. In comparison with other narrator's...she is VERY good. She changes her voice and inflection just enough that there is a difference between characters but not so much that it sounds awkward or ridiculous.<br /><br />If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?<br />They have already laid their bodies bare to each other, can they survive the baring of their hearts?<br /><br />Any additional comments?<br />I really enjoyed the story and wish I had a Gideon of my very own!ey are interrupted AGAIN by Christopher but are situated so that he can't see what is going on underneath Eva's skirts - and there is A LOT going on under there!<br />\\"I climaxed.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|Adults playing games of revenge. The start and body of the book was good reading. However when it turned out to be serious, no one was held accountable. Almost like childish pranks from a wife who thinks she is not getting enough attention and goes too far to punish her husband.
1623420148|2.0|I have been trying to finish this book for over 3 weeks now.  I had a very hard time to get excited or interested about this book.  I would not recommend it.  I probably will not finish reading it.
B007SGM084|5.0|What else is there to say? This is a modern day Cinderella story with a kinky twist. Reading the trilogy for the 2nd time now.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|When I read Diary of a Wimpy Kid book 7<br /><br />I thought it was going to be lame. But when I read to the 100th page I realized it was really good
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Had to see it again before we saw RED 2.  Great movie.  RED2 is better.  Can't wait for RED3.  I can relate to these guys; Retired, Extremely Dangerous.
B00985E3UG|3.0|Michael Pollan writes pretty much the same story.  I liked his book better. I cook. Real food. 6 nights a week.  This story is why Europeans are thin and Americans are obese.

B008BU75IQ|4.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed reading about the trials and triumphs of the Clifton/Barrington clan. Archer has a knack for twists and turns and pitting the bad against the good that keeps the reader interested. There are times the plot does seem rather contrived instead of having a natural flow. Another habit of Mr. Archer's is using little cliff hangers throughout the story.  Although an effective writing method, it is somewhat overused by Archer and gets old.<br />The other criticism I have of this particular book is the ending.  When I read the last  page and turned to see what was next, I came across a list of books by Mr. Archer.  My comment was \\"What the heck?\\" If I had been reading a paper edition, I would have been checking to see if someone had torn out the last page. It was  like someone taking an enjoyable trip when suddenly you run out of gas miles from a station and you are stuck and unsure what to do.  So Mr. Archer, did you run out of gas? Or are you planning a sequel?  At the end of the other two books there were advertisements of the upcoming books or of the series in which only 3 books are mentioned.  What are your plans Mr. Archer? Are you a tease? Or are you just really bad at endings?
B0060MYM3S|5.0|THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS SERIES IS REWATCHING IT, THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T SEE BEFORE, AND YOU PROJECT YOURSELF RIGHT INTO THE ROOM WITH THEM.....MAY IT NEVER END!  HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS, LEAVING THE END SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO. GREAT ACTORS IN ROLES THEY HAVE MADE THEIR OWN ......THANKS FOR THAT.

B008JJM88Q|4.0|He's quite accurate and it is fun to see how he questions you to arrive at answers.  With all the user input, he's quite aware of even obscure characters in odd references.  I have stumped him a few times, so it IS POSSIBLE!

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I used this workout for both of my pregnancies and LOVED it. Erin is encouraging and the workout is perfect for pregnancy- leaves you a little breathy and makes you sweat but is not over the top. I used the DVD 2-3 times a week and ate reasonably well and gained 30 lbs in my first pregnancy and 25 in my second. I owe this all to Erin! I will be giving this as a gift to all of my pregnant friends.
1432794426|5.0|I highly anticipated the arrival of my new book \\"Defending the King\\" by Karen Moriarty.  I just started reading it last night and I had a hard time putting it down to go to sleep.  The book is wonderful so far and I am sure by the time I have finished this book I will look forward to another book from Karen.  Very well written and beautiful.  A tribute to Michael and for once something positive about the King of Pop.  He is truly a legend that the earth will miss, he was of the earth as a gift from God.  Karen's work here is a must for all Michael Jackson fans- and for those who do not understand him, you will after reading this book.<br />Thank you Karen!! I am really enjoying your work!!<br />Melinda Marie
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|This is a very cool and useful app. The detail in it is great. I love the cheese mode! It is always accurate and helps prove it when someone says &#34;must be a full moon.&#34;<br />Sadly, it doesn't do anything else. I can't get weather, I can't get time information. It is just for the moon phases.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Beginner is a cake walk. Easy is fairly balanced until you get 12/12 for skills. Normal is where the AI starts to cheat. I don't know if they get a capture speed bonus or make ships faster, but if the AI gets the slightest advantage (and it starts with one), you're not going to win. In the time it takes you to capture 3 systems, the AI will have 4 or 5. Even using special abilities, I couldn't outpace the AI ship production.<br /><br />After you beat easy, it's too simple but normal is simply unfair.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I love this game. It is a lot of fun to play and the graphics are great.
0375703764|4.0|The book is rather strange and a little confusing, however it isn't bad. The fact that there are really three stories being told at once, keeps it interesting.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I read about this in the \\"paper\\" this morning, it was sold out on amazon and i went to best buy immediately and got one of only 3 left.<br /><br />For $35, roku models being >$50 and apple tv $100 (I have an apple tv gen2) this is a sensational purchase. Granted, more apps and flash support through chrome will be required to make it more versatile, coming from apple I appreciate that any android or apple user can simply connect to my tv and display netflix and anything (sans video) on chrome.<br />3 months of Netflix is also included so it's more like $11 if you're already a subscriber.<br /><br />This can be useful for various reasons, presentations at work, projectors at school, it's so easy to plug and play - the only requirement being wifi. So one Chromecast is theoretically adequate for an entire household also.<br /><br />I've used the basic features: Chrome is great for any browsing that doesn't involve flash (that's up to you how bad that feature is lacking), Youtube videos are all available, and Netflix is top quality. I hear HBO GO will be available soon with Hulu and the like.<br /><br />Apple Tv comparison: No AirPlay. Chrome mirroring lags slightly, but just as much.  No access to iCloud/iTunes music or videos unless you 'somehow' transfer them to google play.<br />Otherwise, one major design 'flaw' is that if your hdmi outlet on the tv is not recent enough, hdmi 1.4, it will need to power itself via USB cable into the tv or the provided power adapter (either is discreet enough).<br /><br />This is a game changer, just be aware it's Google's first release and subsequent software updates will improve the features list.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love to chalange myself. This game makes you really think. It's also a race of time. I play it every day!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|The Conjuring is James Wan's best film to date. It's destined to be considered a classic in time. It doesn't rely on blood, sex/nudity or profanity to get a reaction out of you and truth be told, there isn't anything offensive in it.<br /><br />And yet it was given an R rating. Why? The MPAA's explanation is that The Conjuring is just too scary. There's nothing you can cut from it that would change the frightening tone that would make it acceptable for kids to be able to easily see it. Frankly, I agree with the rating.<br /><br />I'm a seasoned horror fan and it's not like I'm calling The Conjuring the be-all-end-all of scary films but it did creep me (a grown man/seasoned horror fan) the hell out and made me anxious as hell all throughout just based on creepy atmosphere, good acting, music, cinematography and the occasional scary but not offensive imagery.<br /><br />The fact is, this movie would give most kids nightmares and while I think it's fine (and admittedly a little fun) to scare them, it's probably a good idea to have an adult there for some kind of comfort.<br /><br />Excellent 70's style, complete with fashion, gritty and soft cinematography, interior design of the house and the famous 70's zooms.<br /><br />The Conjuring, is in my opinion, destined to become a horror classic in like 10 years time once it's brushed off its \\"'new horror movie\\" reputation. This genuinely unsettling haunted house movie comes highly recommended!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a challenging game that me and my 9 year old had a blast working on together. I wish it were longer because we enjoyed the challenge.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|All of the stars shine brightly, and especially so together. This is an examination of humanity, sexuality, and humanism at every turn -- all without cliche. The supporting actors are also astounding in their craft individually and together.  This is a remarkable, courageous piece of work -- at once hilarious, uplifting, and deep.  Based on a true story, but the resulting craft doesn't count on that fact to be memorable and stirring.  Even better on the second viewing.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My daughter (9 years old) loves this game.  She thinks it is awesome! Challenging in some ways, but worth the effort.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was not part of the cult when my daughter recommended it years ago. I saw it then and was struck with its originality, immediacy, and timeless relevance. The writing, directing, and acting are the stuff of enduring art. Each cast member is a virtuoso, and what they pull off together is nothing short of astounding. After years of not seeing it, I wanted to introduce my significant other to it, to enjoy her reaction. I had lent my copy to someone on the West coast, so it was easier and cost-effective to buy another. This time, I was blown away by it, and so was she. Firefly is compelling and timeless, and not by accident. The actors' affection for their ensemble craft leaps off the screen, and the writing sparkles.
B007N85POS|4.0|Yes, I still sometimes play angry birds. I like Rio, although knocking out the golden fruit is sometimes not so easy.
0062255657|5.0|I'm not sure where to begin describing how much I loved this book. It has, as someone has already mentioned, an almost invisible prose, meaning that the story is so good you really have to stop and make yourself aware of the fact that the writing is extraordinary too.<br />Showing the vulnerable and innocent world of a child through the eyes of a grown-up, aware of the fact that memories changes with time. The book is magical, sad, sweet and on top of all, a page turner. A fascinating story, and a must read!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Looking forward to seeing Red 2! The humor and action was very enjoyable. Bruce Willis steals the show with his cool machismo.
159514188X|4.0|I chose this book because the plot sounded amazing. And it does, right? I thought, what a great idea! So I got the book. Duh. Anyway, I started reading it...I won't say I didn't like the book, I totally did. Like I said, it's interesting (Or the plot, at least), the idea is amazing. But the way he wrote it all out...was a bit boring. To me, it seemed to drag on and on...the audio tapes weren't that interesting...I feel that it dragged on, and the characters needed a bit more personality. But all in all, the book was good. I'd definitely give it a try, don't pass it up because I (Or anyone else) think it's boring or slow. It is touching, the ending is good, and the idea is amazing. Maybe he can re-do? Or someone can come along and maybe do a touch-up or something? But knowing this is his first published novel, I'll give him credit. Jay Asher did real well with it, and I'll give him four stars for that. So...let's sum this up:<br /><br />Three stars for the book (the plot, the characters, etc...)<br /><br />One star for Jay Asher, since it's his first book and he did excellent. So totaled, that's four stars.<br /><br />Read the book. There's 50/50 chance, you know. :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got my Chromecast about an hour ago and I freaking love it.  Works awesome from my laptop and my phone.  The picture quality is great.  Watching my YT channel subscriptions just got so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />*UPDATE* -- I've been using this for a couple of days non-stop and its great.  I wasnt feeling well yesterday so I just moved this into the bedroom TV and watched Netflix all day.  The control from my phone is great.  Being able to watch other stuff besides YT and Netflix is just fine by Casting from your Google Chrome Browser.  A little laggy but it works just fine.
1575666286|5.0|Gerson is one amazing family that really cares and I appreciate what they say.  Have confidence in them.  They are brilliant.
B00AZMFO9U|3.0|Left me wanting to &#34;hear&#34; the quartet. The acting was well done but there was no pulling the story all together for the viewers to enjoy. The ending is projected but left me wanting to actually experience the scene.
B00004YRQA|5.0|This is for my son's playstation. Have never heard any complaints from him or any problems and believe me, if there were any he would let me know!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft because its an awesome game to play.you can express your feelings towards minecraft.people love this game and its good that people give the game all stars.it finally came for kindle fire.people love this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I can spend hours on it. My friend and I played this game the whole day it was  a blast.
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"joy land\\". I love the feel of the pulp fiction and Mr. King is so good at it! Of course, I think everything he writes is a masterpiece being a lifelong fan! Keep on truckin'!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am so glad I downloaded this free app.!  I originally downloaded this for my 4yr old who loves minions.  He loves to watch me play the game and loves to change their outfits.  It's a bit challenging to play for a 4yr old.  Love the game and graphics!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|It is just like the one at the theater except it is on my TV and much smaller. What else can someone say about a movie?
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book the first and the last time I read it.Gets better each time I read it. Hope Movie is as good.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I got this today and it's easy to setup. I used to use PS3 and Apple TV to stream contents from my devices or Amazon or YouTube already. I think Chromecast is great product for someone who doesn't have any those devices. I'm not sure if someone who has PS3 or Apple TV like me will love this device. Also this device needs USB power. So you need to hook it up to two ports with unwanted long wire. Now I see why Google doesn't want to mention it in any photos and even promo videos. It looks clutter. This made everyone confused. As a result of wiring with USB cable, well, it looks weird. Overall, it's great device but not super yummy.<br /><br />* Is there anyone who got a redeem code for Netflix? Is it by email from Google? I know the promotion is over but I heard buyer who ordered before 1pm PST can redeem it. But how?<br /><br />- Update : Amazon updated its product info. It says \\"Customers who ordered their Chromecast prior to 5:31 PM PST on July 24, 2013 will receive a Netflix gift code via email within 5 days of their product's ship date.\\" Thanks for letting me know, jonsid.<br /><br />- Update : I heard you don't need to hook up to USB if you have HDMI 1.4 ready TV. I'm not sure about it since my TV doesn't have it but it seems it's true. Check out your TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a good game love i think this game is better then temple run but that is my opinion anyway great game get it
B008Y768XO|5.0|One of the most touching stories I've seen in a long time. A beautiful tale about a dog and his best friend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|O my gosh! This app is a must have for Christians. It has a Bible, devotions, you can share your favourite verses ( which is a great way to witness ) and a lot more!! I really hope you enjoy it like I do. God bless.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun i recommend to everyone  young or old everyone in my family loves playing this game.<br /><br />tv
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Have you ever had one of those nights when you just can't sleep? Well this app is perfect for you. When you just need to relax, just pick some of the sounds, you can even mix them. Great for if you are really stressed.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Too much gratuitous nudity - it doesn't need this to carry the plot. Scenery, graphics and characters are well-cast. Very enjoyable.
B009WUBERW|4.0|these guys are pretty good actors. special effects good but they are to old for these parts and should be the end
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|This is the best album I've purchased in a long time. From beginning to end it's non-stop eargasm. If you like good music, you need to own this.
0345529057|3.0|The story line and (sometimes overdeveloped) characters intrigued me right away and I found myself sucked into the story very quickly. The level of detail at times is somewhat tedious and distracting, but overall I was enjoying the story... until nearly every character you became interested in started being brutally slaughtered. I really can't understand the author's rationale behind investing so much time and energy into building engaging characters, only to summarily kill them off....repeatedly! Just as you get invested in a central character, BAM! they're horribly slaughtered in some over-the-top manner. I made it into the third book only because I was determined to at least try to read them since I had already purchased the series. But less than a quarter of the way into the third book I had all I could stand and set them aside. I have no interest in reading them further, its just too complicated and frustrating to be entertaining to me. I'm sure it made a much better TV series where it cold be simplified and more readily sorted out in short installments (although I would consider an abridged version, if it were to come out as an audio book). Damn shame to ruin such a great story...
B0036EH3U2|4.0|Except for a few lackluster episodes (including the series finale), this is one of the best shows I've ever seen on television.  I was so happy to be able to purchase the entire series on Blu-ray.  I was not overly impressed with a couple of things about this collection, though:  #1 - The physical packaging.  It seems flimsy.  #2 - The lack of special features.  I assumed there would be lots of features about the making of the show, how they created the special effects, etc. but there's really not much of that at all.  Most of the special features consist of episodes with commentary which I really don't care about.  The show itself, though, is out of this world!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|This is my first George Benson CD, but it will not be my last.  It's amazing how you can almost close your eyes & see (as well as hear) Nat singing.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that loves Nat as well as George.
B00BG5CXGM|3.0|I like the case, The color and feel is great! The only downside to it is the headphone jack. You can't fit your headphones in without removing the case or else it won't work. Everything is great except this flaw. I listen to music a lot and use the jack and taking of my case everytime is annoying
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my son loves it! he says it is fun and challenging. i'm pleased because it is enjoyable and appropriate for him at age 9.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics and fun story line. Cool hidden object games, sweet puzzles, and great backdrop. Only loses one star because it is a really short demo.
B0081J95TE|5.0|I love Shirley Manson (Garbage) for being able to be a smart, talented and sexy artist without being trashy and generic like a lot of other female singers out there. Some of my favorite songs from this album are &#34;Control,&#34; &#34;Not your kind of people,&#34; &#34;Sugar&#34; and &#34;What Girls are made of.&#34; Overall it's a very catchy and empowering album.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a blast!  The graphics are awesome and I love playing bingo as well as the slot games.
B00005U122|5.0|Sin palabras
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|John Fogerty is a legend and continues as such. Have been a fan since the 60's, attended CCR concerts, and continue to attend his solo performances. This album is a great collaboration of talent and voices!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Excelente
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best si-fi books I've read - it is awesome! I would recommend this book for middle and high schoolers.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was awesome and very well written.<br />Everyone should have to read this book. I hope this author writes more books.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Watched it on a 106 inch DLP 3D projector, great graphics and spectacular documentary.  IMAX movies are the only thing I've found so far that is actually worth paying the extra price for BluRay and one of the only things I actually like in 3D.
B00821PCJS|5.0|A lot of sci-fi series tend to be hero faces bad guy, fighting him off and saving the day.  While this tends to follow that trend, this has one fantastic trait of being placed in a setting that occurs after the initial alien invasion.  It gives the sensation of hope we get from the standard hero/villain situation, and gives it the twist of the hero already having lost the initial battle.  It's the underdog story we rarely see, and is honestly more realistic for this reason, making it one of the better sci-fi's I've seen on TV thus far.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|I was looking for good music with a good Christian foundation and I struck GOLD with these guys!<br /><br />Now before you pass these guys up because of the &#34;Christian&#34; thing I said, I want to say they aren't at all &#34;in your face&#34;.<br /><br />Look up the lyrics to their music! Their lyrics can go out to any crowd, but they are confirmed Christians and play for youth groups. Again, you don't have to be a Christian to absolutely love these guys.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. I didn't realize he and Watson were such interesting people. I also had never read a book by a Brit author and found the words and phrasing by Sir Arthur to be quite refreshing.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love Harry Potters movies is Great movie and I love it alot and love the Action and the Drama.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. Fast paced, colorful. More levels open up as you earn points that are free. Really enjoyed this one.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I travelled with the book and lived it too !wonderful.. mr hosseini did a super b job one more time
B00D0OR5EC|2.0|This wasn't a horrible book but it wasn't great either. It just fell a bit short for me. Although this book was about Susannas mental disorder,it barely discussed what was wrong with her until the very end. I wad hoping to delve into the inner workings of her mind a bit more.
B00B4804KS|5.0|The title says it all! The 3D makes you feel like the dinosaurs are right in your living room! I recommend this if you have a 3D TV.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I haven't seen the movie, and although I like the actors, I find it hard to believe I'll enjoy it more than the book. Highly recommended!
B004GYY714|5.0|My son want it to have a music app since I use this on my phone to listen mexican radio and works gray for me the paid version I left him try the free one.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I used it to convert a bunch of 35mm slides to .jpgs. Easy to use and worked flaelessly. Couldn't be happier!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I have this app on my phone so when my kid asked me for a calculator app I did not hesitate to install this one specially for the fraction function.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it so much. Horses are fun. This game is awesome.<br />I would highly recommend it. I like the competition in this game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|At first I thought this was just a simple form of solitaire but as you begin to plan its hard to quit and really fun.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The first novel followed in Fifty Shades of Grey's footsteps, but it had some original thoughts in there. While I thought that the exploration of the physical relationship was unique, I found the rest of the novel to be formulaic and at times boring. Not many surprises here. And more Carey would have helped a lot.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This came here right on time and the movie was in the best condition I've ever seen. Way beyond any store bought movie  I might even go to say that it may be better then MOVIE STOP its an awesome  place to find movies but they put all that shrink warp and cover in stickers and I can't stand it it's total garbage when they do that you rip the thing up just tryin to get the stickers off all in all I'm a bigger fan of Amazon now
B002M2T1UO|3.0|I received a nice box set of the seasons but there were a couple of discs missing. Disc four of season two was not there and there were two sets of disc two in season seven. The FINAL DISC OF SEASON SEVEN WAS MISSING!  That is the most distressful, as it is the end of the series. Otherwise the discs and box were in good shape, but the missing discs were hugely disappointing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I think there is a lot of confusion about what you can do with the Chromecast.<br /><br />It doesn't replace my ROKU, however if i am on the computer and want to cast it up to the tv ... its as easy as a click of the mouse. If i am watching a Youtube video and the wife wants to see it ... we don't have to huddle around the ipad screen ... one click and its cast to the TV. Is any of this new ... not really ... but what is new is the fact that it can be done instantly and with no effort....
B005MLOKXA|3.0|This is much like LA Law used to be or Ally McBeal.  It's a good show and I like the interaction between the characters. It is a much more serious show and the main characters are very serious as well.  This show doesn't provide for a lot of levity.  The characters don't seem to be fully developed and in some cases the relationships seem unlikely because of this.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is really good! If you like action and adventure, this is the book for you! Have fun reading!
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|albert king's awesome playing and singing with the stax backing band.  seminal memphis blues/soul recording with booker t and the mg's as a backing band, whats not to like?
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Yea this was the best comedy I saw in a while, only saw it once to say it was a pretty weak movie but loved the jokes!
B00BVVA138|4.0|I have been a big fan of Killswitch for years now.  I like this album, however I do like Howard's older stuff.
1781162646|4.0|This is not your typical Stephen King book.  I was not scary but kept my interest for the whole time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is Coco. She is a brown horse. The competitions are fun. She is a good horse.<br /><br />The End
B00BYISQTO|4.0|Of course, this is totally my own opinions.  But I think &#34;High Violet&#34; is one of the best albums in my collection, I still listen to it all the way through, after 2+ years.  I had really high hopes for the new CD, and it was really hyped, I think a lof of people had the same high expectations from The National.<br /><br />From the Amazon reviews, looks like &#34;Trouble&#34; is another popular release.  It just didn't click with me the same way that &#34;Violet&#34; did.  There are a solid 5-6 songs on the CD, the rest, honestly, seem like filler.  Maybe I expected too much?  Not sure.  I do like some of the CD, just not all of it.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|Has several of the memorable themes from the movie. Great music for getting you pumped up! Unfortunately does not have the vocal tracts from the end credits.
0500516766|5.0|Seriously great job on this book.  I remember seeing a couple of the pics posted before the book was released, and based on those I put it in my cart waiting for the book to be released.<br /><br />Book does NOT disappoint.  For anyone who loves taking things apart and knowing how they work, this is a great book.  You really appreciate the artistry and engineering that go in to making these items.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Lightly entertaining.  No big story line.  A light hearted approach to trials and tribulations of  expectant moms.  A good selection of actresses.
1452126577|5.0|Grumpy Cat, a.k.a. Tardar Sauce, brings out my inner cackling misanthrope.  Every page is full of sour anti-social humor, leaving me wanting more.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|What a breathe of fresh air. An amazingly talented Tatiana Maslany stars in this terrific series. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. Highly recommend.
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Love everything about this album.  Like the old PSB are back.  I am a huge fan and have everything they have done.  This is as good as the originals back in the 80s.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Loved this series!  It was great!!  Can not wait for the other seasons to get down loaded onto Amazon Prime!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Might not compare to the action and creepy zombies in World War Z, but this was a feel-good happy ending movie for humans and zombies alike.
B002KKCVVO|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from these sandals for the amount of I've paid. They were a little tight, a bit slippery when wet. One too many straps. Look else where if you are going to pay over $50 to $60 bucks for sandals.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This is a good and handy calculator.  This is true especially considering it is a free app.  Just beware the ads.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love it and provides hours of entertainment for the whole family.  my kids love it too. definitely a strong recommendation
B008Y2X78S|4.0|Although fictional in nature, this show is simply groundbreaking. If you have not yet given it a chance, do so! The sets, character development, and story all leave little to be desired. And of course it doesn't hurt to have HBO and their unlimited budgets behind the show, either. Highly recommended!
B006S08RLU|5.0|I don't know if this is a girl thing (I'm not a real girly girl anyway) but this movie is freaking adorable. There is some darkness, so it's not completely sugar syrup.
140006922X|5.0|I ordered this book today, after reading excerpts of it in the \\"click to look inside\\" feature.  I had written a scathing 1 star review that had thrown a wet blanket onto anything that smacked of \\"RELIGION\\" - which Amazon wisely refused to post, my apologies and thanks to \\"those guys in the back room\\".<br /><br />After I read the entire book, I'll add onto this review; I'm really looking forward to this read of early religious history.  As a Lutheran Preacher's Kid, I'm attempting to sort out this riddle called \\"religion\\".<br /><br />and then:  This book is a good history lesson of the actors, on the stage, of 2000 years ago.  Do not read the book to prove or disprove a historical & divine Jesus.  Read it for the wonderful history lesson of those times.  The author has no hidden agenda as a (current belief system) Muslim.<br /><br />I eagerly await the author's next quest, a book on \\"The Life and Times of Mohammed - The True Origins of Islam\\".<br /><br />Don't forget - \\"God loves you, just as you are, She really does!\\"
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google's Chromecast is brilliant. I mean really brilliant. The fact that any chrome tab can be &#34;cast&#34; to any dumb TV is amazing. It was so easy to setup and works amazingly well. So far, there is no noticeable lag or delay and quality is amazing - I tried playing a Netflix video and it worked very well. I'll revise this review with more findings as I get to use it more.<br /><br />(You rock Amazon. It's amazing I already have it in my hands.)
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Tried Google chromecast today, this is a very half baked product. it works well with Youtube & Netflix but transferring browser contents is very tedious .... plus even on youtube, it behaves in a very weird way for e.g. even after i close the youtube window, it keeps playing the last video like a ghost. It just shows that like every other Google product this was never tested & just rolled out .... this is the reason why APPLE rocks !! RETURNING GOOGLE CHROMECAST TODAY
B00DHNJGCU|1.0|Don't come much worse than this movie<br />What waste of money ,acting and story about as bad As it gets
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I really enjoy using this tool, and then posting it right away on fb. It can also be sent right away to an e-mail or twitter.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fast paced game. Kids love it! Would recommend to anyone that likes a challenging game filled with the despicable me minions.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Addicting some of the weapons are a little awkward but all in all a great game. Make sure you have some time to kill because it is very easy to get wrapped up in this one.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Yes, you are required to spend real money to finish the game, and yes, the prices are ridiculous.<br />Now that that's out of the way, we'll get to the good stuff.<br />First, it's the usual build your own town game where you purchase characters, buildings, and shops to unlock more levels and new goals. Now for the review:<br />GRAPHICS<br />The graphics are good, for the most part, except for a few moments in the ball game where certain body parts will overlap and look awkward, but that's not a huge problem. There are few mistakes, however, like how Rarity's horn is missing in the shop, and the purple unicorn rarity model (I can't remember her name, Gardenia or Lily or something) is missing her horn when she walks around the town. Those are really the only mistakes in the graphics, I think.<br />MUSIC<br />It's really good, actually. It sounds almost like the real mlp. Gameloft, I applaud you for that. And that's pretty much it about music.<br />IN-GAME GAMES<br />Yeah, we all know these are lacking. A lot.<br />The Ball Game:<br />Boring and not very helpful with progress in earning five stars for your pony. First off, Gameloft didn't bother to lengthen where the ball hits the head of the pony when you're playing with a foal. It bounces off the air above their manes like magic or something. That's laziness for you, kids.<br />Also, the concept just isn't interesting. Swiping my finger across a screen a million times isn't any fun.<br />Star Game<br />Repetitive. Plus, your finger cramps up after so long of playing it.<br />The Apple Game<br />This is the best one of all of them. Though it can be a little boring after a while, it's still engaging as ever. Only complaint: sometimes the controls don't work.<br />Magic Wings<br />Ponified jetpack joyride. That's all that needs to be said.<br />GAMEPLAY<br />Easy enough for a six year old, engaging enough for a twenty year old. The goals are little repetitive at times, but it's still fun. However, I don't think rainbowdash and rarity should cost gems in the store, and I don't think goals should require real cash to complete.<br /><br />PONIES<br />They should have tried harder to get the names right (fleur dis Lee) but it's not horrible. And the designs are all very show-accurate. I wish there were more male designs, though.<br />IN GENERAL<br />A good game. Really, it is. Just because a game charges for certain items doesn't make it evil. So get it. Have fun with it. And remember, it's just a game.
0061950726|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and am now eager to read Christina Baker Kline's other books! So glad I discovered this author!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Fun game I think it is better than the first one, at least I think so really realistic. I recommend this game to WW 2 gun enthusiasts
B00CLD65X0|4.0|This is just a wonderful series!  You get so emotionall invested in each character whether you care for them or not. Emotional season!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a constant ringing in my ears. For years I have been going to sleep to the same tired cds. With this app I can have quiet rain or dramatic storm.  I can try soundscapes I never considered before. I don't have to hear the cd player running. I can program a timer for as long as I like but I rarely stay awake a whole hour. Intuitive to use. Interesting interface.
B009EEDJOM|5.0|This movie by far is one of my favorites! I can watch it over and over for just the music and love story. Always brings a tear to my eye!
B005K17RU0|3.0|the info is there but you have to work to get it.<br />Lots of wasted space. not very well laid out...
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Loved going back to a different time in our world history! The first season moves very quickly. Enjoyed a more interesting history lesson than high school world history!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome. I really do love this game, but, it would pause every once in a while, and I don't like it.<br />If you could do your best to repair this little bug, I would very much appreciate it. :)
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|A great app to start with learning how to use your  new kindle. Lots of books, cookbooks, and more. And it's free.
B0094KOSO6|5.0|we've gone through three dvds and I refuse to buy any more!  he watches it so much, the dvds get scratched and start to skip.  the only bad thing about not having a dvd (hurricane Sandy proved it) is if the cable goes out!!
1579128955|2.0|The story of the elements and the science behind them should make fascinating reading.  Instead we get with this book an author with a liberal-environmentalist agenda intruding into what should be a simple and straightforward scientific explanation.<br /><br />Did you know that sulfur was an &quot;evil element&quot;?  And that &quot;it has the blood of millions on its hands&quot;?  The author seems to think so--because of its association with gunpowder!<br /><br />When we get to radium, we don't actually SEE any radium.  Instead we get a shot of an old radium dial watch, and also various other turn-of-the-century vials of radium-type knicknacks from the author's collection. There is nothing about Marie Curie's heroic efforts to isolate a few decigrams of the element from tons of pitchblende, in an old wooden shed behind her house.  We get nothing about how the discovery and research into radium led to modern particle physics.  What we DO get is an impassioned lecture on the &quot;radium girls&quot; who painted watches and developed cancer; and an attendant lesson on the evils of industrialists and how the &quot;radium girls&quot; case pioneered the increased use of lawsuits in the workplace!<br /><br />Of course by the time the author gets to uranium, he is almost frothing at the mouth over the horrors of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.  Nothing about the laborous and fascinating process of extracting U-235 isotope from the much more abundant U-238--especially with 1940's technology.<br /><br />Many of the pictures in the book are murky and poorly lit, so you cannot really get an idea of what leutitium or lanthanum looks like.<br /><br />Very little on the actual physics of the elements, their production, various compounds, details of extraction, etc.<br /><br />I'm in the process of looking for a better book without the agenda of the author--who denounces modern technology while obviously enjoying its benefits.<br /><br />I give the book 2 stars, mainly because it gives at least a glimpse of a few of the rare earth elements.it gives at least a glimpse of a few of the rare earth elements.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Loved this game to start, highly addictive. At some point they switched the color scheme though, and that made it slightly more difficult to play. No big, still a good game. However, it doesn't take long to get to max level, and after that there's really no incentive to play further. I played the game for a couple more days maybe and then just forgot all about it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Excellent book that keeps you from doing anything else. I can't imagine a better series of books than the Twilight Saga.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|There's a lot of talk about this book being completely unoriginal, wands like in Harry potter and such. But this book was AMAZING! Definitely loved this book, and the story just continues to get better and better as the series progresses. I can admit, it starts off kinda slow, but keep reading!! If you enjoy this book, then you'll fall in love with the next ones!!
B004LROUNG|3.0|I LOVE Grisham but I have to say this novel was just okay.  I kept waiting and waiting for an event that would jump start the book and it never arrived.  This definitely wasn't one of his best.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I liked the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo better.  This one got a little drawn out in places.  Still liked all three of the books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie more than the book but still think both are great.  The book is a little harder to follow but perhaps I understood it better because I had already seen the movie.  Love the perspective it is written in.
B0026KX6TY|5.0|This is an awesome heart-warming movie with a great plot.  It was very enjoyable to watch.  I'd highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|3.0|I had to read it from all the hype I've heard about it over the past few years.  I enjoyed it from the love story perspective...not the other one.  I can see the different opinions everyone has about Christian...loving or domineering? It's not my favorite and I'm not sure I would reread them, but they provided decent entertainment for a few days.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It was good but don't know what happen ....later on the explorer started being acting up.....browser not respond in and no way to fixed....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A really good escape game. Cant wait for upgrade.  Makes you think and look logically. Best of all escape games tried
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I got this for my seventeen-year old so he wouldn't trash or lose his other watch during all his summer adventures.  He's picky about his watchbands, but as I figured, he loves the metal and canvas one on this watch, seeing how comfortable it is.  The black dial is also perfect for summer because it doesn't reflect unduly, the date helps keep him on track, and the luminous hands are perfect for checking time in the tent after dark.  It's sturdy, Seiko's quality has a very good, well deserved reputation, and we even got this on sale.  In other words, I've got one happy kid on my hands, which makes for one satisfied and happy mom.
159463176X|2.0|his first two books were very good,but this one was not good.The story was a muddle and hard to understand
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|When I watched this, I didn't realize the 2 main protagonists are actually played by professional musicians. No wonder the soundtrack is wonderful! This is one of those few watch-with-a-smile/feel good films.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Being a fan of grand space operas and highly rated sci-fi (think Hyperion, Dune, A Fire Upon the Deep), I was expecting to be blown away by this also highly rated book. Dont get me wrong, it was a wonderfully written story with complex character development that I enjoyed. I am glad I read it for sure. ONLY thing I didnt like was that for the majority of the book, the setting was the same. I found myself anticipating a change of scenery, something else to visualize. That unfortunately did not take place as I expected. Mabe if I less of an expectation of grandeur, I wouldnt have felt this slight disappointment. I recommend this book to any sci-fi lover, just dont expect much variation in the way of setting.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Like everything else that I have read by this author, the book was good entertainment. If your looking for Hemingway quality writing, look elsewhere, but if your looking to be entertained, look no further.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|This movie captures many of trials and tribulations of raising children while grappling with growing older and the myriad of responsibilities as parents. The two leads, Rudd and Mann are very funny.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love Big Bang and have watched it from the beginning. This season was delivered fast and undamaged. These reviews are for the product itself, not to review the show itself,so my review is in regards to the product is that it was great.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Quality of the picture and sound is great. This is a must have if you're a Zepp fan! Only thing better is being there.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and the series! I was not particularly happy with the ending, but I understood why Collins had to end it that way.
0767817729|5.0|So very well done. Darned near everything you want in a movie contained in this. Not normal Costner movie and yet perhaps timing of it didn't make it do wonders at boxoffice. I'm sure glad I got it and also got another for one I knew would like it greatly.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Pretty good story.  A little predictable, but with a few twists that kept it interesting.  Worth reading if your a Jack Reacher fan.
0805092447|1.0|The company I purchased this book from sold me trash. The pages were stuck together and the words were missing from some of the pages, They should have thrown this book in the trash can.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I rated the book on the basis of what I expected I might learn from reading it.  That is, I was interested in learning more about the author's warrior life as well as family life.  The book satisfied my curiosity about the brotherhood among Navy Seals as well and the kind of men that aspire to be one.  Finally, I was interested in sniper technique and operations.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Me and my kids love this game. I thought it was gonna be a stupid game but after playing it once, I can't stop. I love it.
B00CM03H4C|4.0|I really like this soundtrack and enjoy most songs on it!  Especially Young and Beautiful by Lana Del Rey, she is now my new favorite artist thanks to this track!
0312427565|5.0|Great history of the early space program. If you enjoyed the Mercury , Gemini, and Apollo programs or Chuck Yeager & his exploits at Edwards AFB you'll love this book. Its one that once started it is hard to put down.  CC
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I loved the game, but really disliked having to continually purchase lives.  Up-and-coming ridiculous.  I eventually completely deleted it from my fire.  I do not like the trend towards saying that an application is free when you have to pay to keep playing.  Offer a version that you can purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really great because it has puzzling levels and that makes you want to play more. I love to play this in the car,in my own room,and anywhere.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|its pretty cool. I like how it starts out.the only thing I don't like is the only place ur in is the lab.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I love that you can train your horse or get someone else to do it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the game so much that the game makes me play it every day.When my friends come they are like do you still have can you escape and I am like yes I do. I love can you escape.
B007JNR518|5.0|One of the reasons why I bought this movie is because I never tire of it no matter how often I see it. The cinematography is beautifully done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quick read and entertaining. I liked the details that weren't covered in the movie - about the genetically engineered mocking jays, natural healing remedies and survival strategies of each tribute. And the vegetation that is edible in the woods.
B001CMV1MG|1.0|I hated it! Did not know what it was about. I'll have to screen the things I buy more carefully.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Orson Scott Card pays great attention to detail when it comes to military strategy, and I appreciate his characters' abilities to find their enemies' weaknesses and exploit them.  The main character, Ender, enters a world where all children are raised as soldiers, calculated and stoic, with little room for mistakes.  Because of this set up, it is difficult to picture any of the children as their actual age.  For each age, children have developmental stages that I believe are lost in Card's futuristic adventure.  I think it would have been more effective to not hear so much of what is going through Ender's head and instead witness his actions.  If the character would have had a more matter of fact reaction and had more of the adjustments to his military life come naturally, I wouldn't have caught myself picturing him as a young adult throughout most of the book.  Children usually do not over analyze everything they or others do--They just act or just know what they know or just observe what they observe.  Children in general are often ego centric and rarely look at the world around them, especially if they are in an isolated environment.<br />I also appreciate the zero gravity battlefields, but I think that unless one has a military background, the action is a little hard to follow--kind of like the Transformers who transform so quickly and are so up close in a movie theatre, that it's hard to really take in what is happening.<br />The book was interesting and kept me reading despite the fact it was hard to figure out who was speaking at times, but because of its hardcore immersion into a boot camp existence and the occasional gory scenes, it just was not my style.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|After reading the book THE MAGIC l am truly grateful to Rhonda Byrne because she transformed my life. For me she is a charming gardener who makes our souls blossoms. Once again very big thank you from the bottom of my heart.
B007MDB71O|5.0|The film was excellent, and it proves that critics just watch way too many movies to retain their balance.  They can't view a movie with fresh eyes like an audience can.  The filmic worlds they created here are equal to those of Star Wars (the first three films) and Lord Of the Rings.  And I demand that the studio make the next two films in the trilogy!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very interesting. Not too challenging, but, good to pass some time. Would recommend if you have a little spare time.  Kids over the age of 10 could play this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Picked up my Chromecast at Best Buy today ( I also have one on order with Amazon ). Currently, You can use your phone to play content from Netflix and Youtube. With a Full SDK its only a matter of a few days before more apps start popping up. On your computer you can stream anything that you can play in a browser. Everything has worked very well so far and I have had zero issues playing a range of media. I think many of the purchasers were really clueless as to what this does and many of them didn't even have the product before they reviewed. If you know what this does you will love it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not User friendly. Old app was. This one has too many ads and a rewards program that gets in the way. Did not find radar map if there is one. Uninstalling now.
B0012NO316|5.0|This movie is delightfully intense. Every single person in the cast was phenomenal! I especially liked Elizabeth Taylor's rough vixen approach to her character. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves theater but can't always go see the shows they want.
034580709X|5.0|The first Harry Hole book has finally been published in English.We find that Harry has been sent to Australia to assist the police to solve the case of a 23 year old Norwegian woman who has been found brutally murdered in Sydney. She had a job in a nightclub and was murdered on a day when she was not working.<br />When Harry arrives in Australia he is met by a detective who is one of the indigenous people who was removed from his mother as a baby and has never really lived as an Aboriginal.His name is Andrew Kensington. He is a charmer who tells Harry that he is assigned to work with him. When Harry meets the police chief, the chief seems a bit surprised by this but leaves Harry and Andrew to work together. Andrew tells Harry a lot about the case but also keeps Harry a bit off balance by his many strange friends and taking Harry around to more places than the reader will think he needs  to go. This is a very intriguing book in every way. I learned a lot about Australia and the history of the indigenous people there but felt Harry was not careful enough about being out of his element. I wish Nesbo would send him back again with all his worldly knowledge he has attained in his checkered career. I thought the book was great and should have been translated when it first came out. I would read anything written by Jo Nesbo, he is my favorite Scandinavian.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|the beginning was very good but it stalled about half way thru. I'm sure I'll get back to it soon.
1452126577|4.0|After reading this book, not only did I become grumpy, the universe decided it was grumpy, too, and set out to ruin my life. First, I woke up to a giant centipede crawling across my ceiling. As I got out of bed screaming, I stepped in something wet and squishy. My cat had shown her grumpiness by barfing up a hairball. Then I forgot my glasses when I left for work and didn't realize until I got there, so I had to go home and get them. Then go back to work. Then I lost my internet connection--after four hours on the phone with tech support. . . I still don't have internet.  Edit: gremlins took over my keyboard and inserted several typos into this review. More proof. So this book is highly effective.<br /><br />Yes, these things really did happen the day I read this book. I'm not making this up.<br /><br />On an even grumpier note, I was disappointed at the pictures in this book. As a long-time follower of Grumpy Cat, I'd already seen most of them. :-( Maybe that's part of the whole \\"learn to be grumpy\\" lesson of the book.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|love this game!! easy, hard, challenging and you work your brain too. it is for everyone. you will love it and it hasn't gotten borning yet!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Funny & Delightful<br />A perfect escape from your busy day!  This is a fast paced enjoyable book that will make you laugh aloud!  Well written and enough layers to make the plot seem possible!  Enjoy!  I have previously bought this book and, later, NetGalley provided an review copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game will make you get addicted to it. There are so many stuff to get or unlock. Anyway,this is the best game to get!
0770437400|5.0|This is a fantastic book. I could not recommend this book more. This is a must read for any fan of post apocalyptic literature
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check the weather where I live in Georgia and where my daughters live in Ohio.  Accu weather is the best app I have had.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I have used multiple Swiss Army brand bags. This one is absolutely the best one. I have a 17&#34; screen Dell Precision Notebook Workstation that is big and heavy. This bag works great with it.
B00049QQHI|4.0|I would recommend to anyone that has been through or wants to know the pain addiction causes in so many lives.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I loved the move in the theater and want my own copy in bluray.<br />I purchased this used copy and it is just like new.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game it is amazing especially the graphics it keeps me entertained after a long day of cheer as a davidson middle school cheerleader it is just something that I enjoy because I love a good challenge every now and then.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought it was a great entertainment to read and I love this series!!! I love the romance and fighting!
B004KKX80A|5.0|i will love it when i get it i hope i get to beat people with my pegasus peace awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked it. It reminded me of unicorns jumping over rainbows. :D I liked this book a lot and I recommend every baby to drool when reading it!
B008UTV6S8|3.0|I guess I was prepared for more Paul Simon-ish sound and not what I heard on this.<br />Too many new, not enough old, not really meant for the grat outdoors.
B009GED3HS|5.0|For those of you who want comedy, drama, clever writing and great acting, look no further. What's even better is that despite being in its 8th season, the show has seen no dip in quality. And, of course, it's the penultimate season--we even find out who the mother is!
0316069884|5.0|The author's bias is clear and his arguments compelling. This book will be confronting for anyone who doesn't really know how animals are raised and slaughtered for food.The book consolidates the information and arguments that I have encountered since I decided to adopt a vegetarian diet 30 years ago. I had cancer back then and became concerned about persistent toxic substances being concentrated up the food chain. As I learned more about my particular cancer, I realized that diet probably had little or no role in its onset. Still, I don't regret my decision and this book gathers together all the reasons that inform my choice.
B0065UF2ZM|5.0|Harry is better than the FBI ... Larger than life... He might even get the girl in the end; he's hard to resist!
B004EPYZOY|4.0|Nick cage is such a flexable character actor it amazes me no end. I am partial to all his movies so don't take my word for it,<br />For Movie content I would only give it a 3 star rating, but because of the way he handled his character I gave 4 Stars.<br /><br />If you haven't seen many of Nick Cages Movies, I would suggest trying a Nick Cage Movie Fest. And most importantly try to watch some of his lesser known movies. If you don;t know them do an Amazon search ......... enjoy
0425266060|5.0|It arrived on time and exactly how described, still wrapped in the plastic protective wrapper that I've seen almost all my series collections come in. Will definitely be purchasing more books on the future.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I first saw this movie when tickets were .26 cents for a Saturday Double Feature with a Cartoon and Newsreel. Ha, those were the days! I do believe we get to see the first appearence of 'Robbie The Robot' (used in Lost in Space) but i may be wrong. Check it out you won't be disapointed
140006922X|1.0|Does this really come as any surprise that the author would be motivated to disparage the image of Christ?  Islamists despise Christ.  The craziest part about it is how the media leaves out that little detail...
B005544V6A|5.0|It is escapist fare and might be a little richly sprinkled with pop culture references to hold up in the long term but it was exactly what I was looking for when I stumbled upon it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hate to see it come to an end!! Do not get to involved with series that often, but was hooked!
B000NY12LO|5.0|Jodi is a great writer. She keeps you riveted to the story and holds your attention. You cannot put the book down.
0553573403|5.0|Yes, just finished reading it. I enjoyed this book. And at the end, talk about waking the dragon... phew!<br /><br />By way of explanation, by the way, Game of Thrones is essentially a dance of royal succession. It's a family feud, Dynasty, and Animal Planet, ensconced in these pages. Historical rgicide, implied regicide (the latter implied, not actual)...let's just say, this is a roller coaster ride, with the brakes off, and you're not quite sure where you will end up, in the end. I'm looking forward to reading book two.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Well done. Pieces click together with musical sound. Beautiful pictures. Hate the ads but worth the price to get rid of them.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I Loved it!!!<br />It was great. I plan on watching it again and again. Everyone should see this. Rent it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This thing is huge, sturdy, and has amazing compartmental organizers. I'm really digging this bag. All of the partitions are moveable and can be configured just as you like. I've got it set up to PERFECTLY fit all of my gear. It has a decent amount of misc. pockets, but I wish it had more &#34;side&#34; pockets. All of the other pockets are on the top or bottom and are great for thin/small items like memory cards, lens caps, cables, etc. But, putting bulky items in there just feels wrong to me. I'd like some pockets on the sides to put some bulkier stuff like batteries, triggers, etc. As of now, they fit nicely on the inside, but I'd prefer the bulky misc. stuff to go in a pocket.<br /><br />Small complaint for an otherwise amazing bag. I'm blown away by the quality and size for the price.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|If yiou are looking to read a stimulating book with somewhat of an uplifting message then you won't enjoy this one very much. dark...somewhat cynical
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Action packed. Love Denzel and am excited by the number of new movies including this great actor.  Safe House was riveting.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|I bought the kindle edition of this book to get a discount on the audiobook, just to find out that I can't buy it!!! It's a shame I had to download it from internet for free when I was willing to pay for it.<br /><br />Hope you get this sorted out soon!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game.  Absolutely funny for our kids (a couple of twins).  Such game makes the waiting times in an airport more enjoyable.<br />I do not grant four stars because is a share version.  Not a fully one. It doesn't matter.  I recommend it highly.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Wish they had spent as much time on being accurate about the weather as they spent on making this app complicated
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We loved this movie.  We had previously seen it but wanted to see it again before we went to see Red2!
B00B2166BS|4.0|Gave this a four star only because the delivery took right to the last day of the ETA. The pogo charging cable works as advertised and frees up my micro USB . I would definitely purchase  from here again.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I just finished Sophie Kinsella's Can You Keep a Secret. This is my second book written by her (the Twenties Girl was the first) but not my last. This is a \\"chic\\" book (chic flick if it was a movie) and a real page turner. For shear mindless fun I recommend this book.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|This collection is simply amazing the colors and images in 1080px are great! This Nightmare collection is a good tribute to the second age of great terror films, all movies except the nightmare 1 (i don't know for why) includes spanish latin languages! This is a great option for my parents! Cause my grandpa is a Freddy's big fan but he don't speak english, well the five stars is deserve if you compare the product with the good price have! Enjoy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game, neat graphics, cool characters. Some times though, the game will not respond to my touch and I lose. Otherwise good, but eats up battery quickly. Also a good way to pass time.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|I have always been a fan of Paul and I was delighted to see this being released in Blu- Ray. I saw the edited version on PBS last year and I would recommend this to anyone. Pricey, so I would wait for a while until the price drops.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|2 sheets of newspaper a match or lighter and in less than 5 minutes the charcoal is ready to place on the charcoal rack
B00DDBNJF6|5.0|It is good to see so many lp's re- released with bonus tracks. This is a great example of a deluxe edition and a must have if you are an Allman Brothers band fan. A bit pricey but consider downloading this collection.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I ordered my Chromecast yesterday (July 25) from Amazon.  At the time, there was no indication on Amazon's product page that the Netflix offer was unavailable.  Today, I read that the Netflix offer is unavailable for those who purchased their Chromecast AFTER 5:31 PM PST on July 24.  This isn't Amazon's fault - Google decided (annoyingly) to suddenly snatch away the offer because they ran out of promo codes.<br /><br />So, I just cancelled my order.  I'm not waiting with bated breath for this thing to be back in stock, either.<br /><br />EDIT: My husband went to Best Buy because they called to tell him they had a few in stock.  He went in, purchased the Chromecast, AND got the Netflix promotion.  This was around 6 PM CST today (July 26).
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is very well designed and great fun. I currently have it for both Android &amp; Xbox 360 and play often.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|I have to figure from reading other Le Carre books that it's not going to be all action packed. He's looking for the realism that he experienced in the field. But this was pretty good. A lot of twists and turns with a bleak ending but it's how it goes in the field.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|The app has been installed on my Kindle Fire for about a month at least an seems to work great. Not sure why some are saying it heats up their Kindle Fire, mine has never heated up because of this app.
0553801473|2.0|Thank goodness I only came to these books recently and didn't have to wait years upon years for A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons, because I feel I would have judged them much harder if I had. Consider my brief thoughts here to be a review of both books, as they have the same problems--problems not shared by the terrific preceding volumes. And of course most of those problems can be chalked up to the very odd decision to split the pair along character lines, instead of simply remaining along a linear timeline. The first message that this unfortunate editorial move sends is that GRRM thinks that the order in which the pov characters alternate doesn't matter. In the first three books, I felt that the sequencing of the chapters was well thought out and helped tremendously to build up suspense and intrigue, but all that is thrown out the window with the fourth and fifth books. That alone gave me the sense that Martin was just treading water for a couple thousand pages. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, where you can skip around and go back later to catch up on what you missed. Story flow no longer matters.<br /><br />Trudging through the uneventful A Feast For Crows was somewhat of a chore, but I can't begin to describe the feeling of reading the first few chapters of A Dance With Dragons and realizing that we're all the way back at the beginning of the timeline begun by Feast. And despite the fact that we are experiencing events through a separate cast of characters, the sense of repetition is overwhelming. Just as an example, the first Jon Snow chapter features Sam being sent off on his journey to Oldtown--a journey that we've already been through in the last book. There is nothing new communicated in these scenes. It's simply repetitious. If people thought that A Feast For Crows was internally repetitious (and it was), then imagine being brought back to the beginning of that book and having it all start over again from a different pov. We're just going in circles.<br /><br />Many of Martin's writerly tics are beginning to wear thin as well. His tendency to simply list things (courses of a meal, contents of a ship's hold, layers of clothing, etc.) in lieu of an actual sentence, his reliance on repeated catch phrases (\\"You know nothing,\\" \\"Wherever whores go\\"), and his overuse of certain descriptions (I imagine a literary drinking game, where everyone takes a shot each time a character is described as wearing \\"boiled leather,\\" or each time the phrase \\"much and more\\" is used). It's all in dire need of editing. I still recall one passage in Feast where a character is referred to as \\"a dusky woman\\" about eight times in three pages. And she's the only woman in the room. We get it. She's black. You don't have to keep calling her dusky. That's not her name.<br /><br />The solution here was obvious: Edit, edit, edit. Cut at least half the chapters of each book (easily more than half of Feast) and combine them along a linear timeline. The sequencing of the chapters matters, and these two books get it all wrong. I'm reading simply out of obligation now. It's sad to see a once great story floundering so badly.
140006922X|2.0|John S. Dickerson, an author and nationally awarded journalist, had the following to say about this book:<br /><br />Reza Aslan, author of the new book, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" has been interviewed on a host of media outlets in the last week. . . .<br />Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.<br /><br />His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.<br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years.<br /><br />Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek.<br />He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.<br /><br />As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br />These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to interviews on NPR, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture. (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine.\\")<br /><br />As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br /><br />In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views--particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br /><br />I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br />My concern is that national media coverage be smart and forthright about this conflict of interest, just as it would be if I--a Christian author and pastor--wrote a book about Muhammad.<br /><br />Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.<br /><br />With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews--some from reporters who want to see Jesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not anobjective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Western culture has believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.<br /><br />Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. It is no more objective than my educated views about Muhammad, as a Christian.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is not new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views that Muslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.\\"<br /><br />John S. Dickerson

The home page is not as clean and easy to read as it once was, and the navigation is not as simple either. I still love weather-watching, so it's staying on my device. It was fine the way it was.

B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|An awesome movie that I am still thinking about a week after watching it.  You MUST sit and think through the movie as it unfolds, not a light movie to be watched while you do the laundry, pay the bills, play on your phone or your laptop.  Demands your attention and even better the second go round when I realized how much I'd missed or misunderstood the first time I watched it.  Love this movie!  Won't be for everyone but for those who will follow it, it is a real treat!
0385349947|4.0|This is a good book with some very credible adaptive strategies for women, certain women that is.<br />Sheryl, towards the end of this book, declares that she wrote it to encourage women to dream big but I wonder which women. Most women, not the CEOs, COOs & CFOs that pepper this narrative, struggle with the daily, relentlessness stresses of work and family. Some aren't even remotely aware of the options open to them because the fight, just to stay in the game, means the serious single-minded business of being concerned about rent, food, clothes, daycare, etc.<br />I agree with a lot of the information shared and found it both necessary and helpful to anyone with even an ounce of ambition. Advice about aligning yourself with a company whose mission includes fast growth, the caution to not hold each other(women)back, successfully negotiating your own desired result, negotiating for all women, personal goals for learning new skills, recognizing that everyone has room to improve, aspiring to lead and getting the support you need from your male and female colleagues, being ambitious, being a participant not a spectator at your own \\"coming out\\", growing your own self confidence, ridding yourself of the imposter syndrome that plagues women and underestimating your own ability, keeping your hand up if you want to get noticed and ultimately ... what would you do if you weren't afraid?<br />All good stuff, however, it is clear that Sheryl is shaped by her personality and upbringing. She is a blessed and privileged woman! I don't know if she knows any ordinary people, women who make a little more than minimum pay and certainly live many zip codes away from her.<br />She name drops a lot and some of  the stories are quite funny/sad. Like the fact that she thinks the woman is a genius who lets her kids sleep in school clothes so that she can save 15 precious minutes in the morning. Yikes, why not give them a month of baths while she's at it, that takes way more time! These people have really smart kids too, for example the 5 year old who worries about who will take care of her kids while she and her astronaut husband are cavorting on the moon. Sorry, I cannot credit that sort of conversation from a 5 year old, no matter how smart. The one about the daughter who wants to be a client when she grows up because they get the most of her lawyer mother's time stretched the bounds of credulity. Also the story about the woman who was not being clear and when asked several times for clarification blurted out, \\"my manager is bad\\". Sheryl shared that it would be good if more people were this clear. Good for who? This kind of work place candor will get you written up at least and at most eventually fired. Most bosses do not take kindly to being criticized and certainly not publicly.<br />Some of her stories are self debasing, some self aggrandizing. The one about asking Google's Zuckerberg for parking spots for pregnant women because she was pregnant and the sprint across the parking lot to get to work/meetings on time was all a bit too much. Most women who are brave enough, never mind foolish enough to verbalize this request would run the risk of Oliver Twist when he asked, \\"please sir I want some more\\". We all know what happened to him!<br />Somewhere in the middle, this book became smug and not at all humble. The examples of Sheryl's big-shot friends and their associates are endless and envious .... if only we could all live their lives for a day. The reality though is what Henry David Thoreau shared, \\"\\"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.\\"<br />I believe that Sheryl is cautioning us against this and in all seriousness suggests that we ask the right questions, what is your biggest problem and how can I solve it? She said if you're offered a seat on a rocket, don't ask which seat, you just get on and ride that baby! Performance, potential and preparation is key to getting to the top if that is what you desire, taking initiative and just lean in!<br />Poet, novelist and editor, John Boyle O'Reilly wrote, \\"Be silent and safe -- silence never betrays you; Be true to your word and your work and your friend; Put least trust in him who is foremost to praise you, Nor judge of a road till it draw to the end.\\"<br />True that!<br />I liked this book, was inspired by it and squirreled away a lot of timely advice. It was an enjoyable read and most professional women will likely enjoy it, I foresee a sequel.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|The basic idea is the same, dressed up in space symbols. Birds smash into objects and destroy aliens. There are some interesting variations on strategy...some missals are fired backward so it is necessary to aim the birds away from the target. It is hard to determine what many of the menu icons are for.
B000FCK9CW|4.0|Sad Cypress closely resembles the Poirot book that preceded it, Hercule Poirot's Christmas, but is I think a much better work. Just as in HP's Christmas, author Agatha Christie provides a rather elaborate and extended setup to the crime in which a series of fairly sympathetic characters are Implicated as possible suspects. Then she brings in Poirot on a consulting basis (to the local police in HP's Christmas and to the defense team in Cypress) and the resolution turns on a case of hidden identity. But Poirot seems more engaged emotionally with the case in Cypress, and the solution is much more plausible than the ridiculous Rube Goldberg scenario Christie constructed for HP's Christmas. I don't think Sad Cypress is a great Agatha Christie book, but it is a very good one, which means a very good mystery novel over all.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great in the aspect of good and evil. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can understands life and how quick it can be snatched away.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I currently own Apple TV, Visio Google TV, Samsung Dongle, and now also Chromecast. Chromecast was by far the easiest to setup, and the overall achitechture (using phone/tablet as remote, and dongle streams on its own) is finally the right step. I am really happy with the way it works... with one BIG exception:<br /><br />There is currently no way (at least none that I found after research of the somewhat limited support info that is available to soon after launch) to display the pictures I took on my phone via TV. My hope/expectation was, that I could stream my photos from Google+ account. I take a lot of pics of the family... Samsung S4... and happy upload them all to Google+ from the nearest wifi or when at home. With FIOS its done in the blink of an eye. While Chromecast appars to allow \\"sharing of a Chrome broswer tab\\", that apprars to only work from laoptops. URG! Big bummer. Of course i do not want to start any laptop when I am home, just to show my kids the photos i took of them on my phone.<br /><br />Certainly I hope that the next Chrome app update for phones/tablets will allow the sharing via Chromecast as well.<br /><br />Overall a very good buy, and you can certainly enjoy YouTube and Google Play movies more conveniently that with other devices.... I think.

B008NCSZQ8|3.0|If I had it to do over, I would've stopped watching this movie mid-stream. I found it way too long and pretty boring. I was probably not the intended audience for this movie. I'm politely giving it a OK rating! Because, I'm a nice person in general!

0812550757|2.0|I come at this from a different perspective than most of the reviewers here.  I  like good novels of any genre with compelling and interesting characters and meaningful and thoughtful themes, but do not generally enjoy science fiction or fantasy as genres in and of themselves.  My general issue with these areas is that authors often tend to substitute meaningful storytelling with complex mythology building for its own sake. (In my lifetime, I have read all five Fire and Ice books and about a gazillion Hickman/Weis books, so I know of what I speak.)<br /><br />With that background, I recently read Ender's Game and enjoyed it; I thought that the author had something important to say, especially in the Cold War context in which it was written.  The story was embedded in a future world which tended to drive the narrative and message and didn't really get too far into side-story gobbledygook until the very end.  Speaker for the Dead takes a different approach; from the very start of the book, an elaborate mythology is constructed in which the characters are placed.  Some of this is meaningful and contributes to the story (such as the extraterrestrial race which humans are trying to understand in light of perceived brutality) but some is just thrown in randomly without contribution to the narrative (a space-colony is a Portuguese, Catholic-chartered bureaucratic dictatorship; there is a secret sentient computer companion that kind of goes nowhere; there's a hive cocoon that the main character carries around and speaks to telepathically, etc.).<br /><br />My perception is that sci-fi enthusiasts will probably loved these aspects of the book and, for them, these details will make for a more complex, vibrant universe in which the characters act and will probably help explain some motivations in clearer way.  For me, all of the side mythology in Speaker for the Dead took away from the narrative effect and the underlying message of tolerance and understanding (which was, by the way, a much more complex and adult take on the concepts than the childish versions with which are often presented).  In all, I think I disliked Speaker for the Dead for the same reason that so enjoyed Ender's Game; while Speaker for the Dead was bloated with unnecessary back-story, Ender's Game was sanded down to the sci-fi minimum to let the characters, narrative, and themes drive the story.<br /><br />In any case, I hope this is helpful even though it disagrees with the vast majority of other reviewers.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Only way to watch this the first week or two it was out was to rent it from Amazon. I wasn't sure if we would like it so I rented it instead of buying it. We all loved it and watched it 3 times before the time expired. Just wish Amazon would credit you the rental amount towards purchase if you deiced to do so shortly after renting it.

And boy was she right!  When delving into Gone Girl, you are signing up for one thrilling ride! I couldn't get enough of the story, and found any opportunity to sneak away to get back inside this crazy world.  Don't miss it.

B00ATPVA78|2.0|The only reason I gave this two stars was because of the interesting plot idea and the gorgeous graphics. Other than that,  this game pretty much sucked. The puzzles are too random and some of them don't even work.  And it's incredibly boring.<br />All in all, 2 thumbs down!

B004BLJQOK|5.0|Great movie, one of the rare vampire films with some actual thought behind it.  Moretz is wonderful, begging the question (although she can hardly be considered a child anymore) why she isn't universally recognized as the greatest child star since the previously incomparable Margaret O'Brien.<br />The best thing about this film (other than Moretz) is that the filmmakers actually sat down and thought about what it would be like to actually live (un-live?) as a vampire.  It avoids occult mumbo-jumbo (no Master Vampire, no Lilith who inexplicably commands the obedience of lesser bloodsuckers)and realistically (a strange word in this context, of course, but you know what I mean) portrays the daily struggle-to-survive of a formerly human child who is now a creature of the night.  In what is probably my favorite moment of all vampire cinema, the vampire is asked by her human pet why she can't enter a human residence without being invited. We've all seen this scene a thousand times, and know what's coming next: some sophomoric pseudo-scientific \\"explanation\\", or the previously-mentioned occult B.S.  This vampire, here, answers as a real vampire probably would: \\"I don't know\\".  She doesn't have time to waste exploring arcane vampiric lore or searching for the Ur-Dracula: her free time is spent scrounging around for something to eat.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Wedding Night follows sisters Lottie and Fliss.  Lottie, the younger of the two, has the attention span of a ferret and is always going from one extreme to the next.  She is sure that her boyfriend of three years, Richard, is going to propose.  When he doesn't, she runs into her boyfriend of 15 years ago and decides to get married immediately.  This sends older sister Fliss into a tailspin, as she tries to make sure that Lottie doesn't make a mistake she'll live to regret.  Fliss herself is going through a painful divorce.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story.  While Lottie was incredibly annoying at the beginning of the book, she kind of grew on me by the end.  I liked the character of Fliss and enjoyed her schemes to keep Lottie from marrying in haste.  As far as Kinsella characters go, Lottie and Fliss are MUCH more likeable than Shopaholic's Becky.<br /><br />Will it change your life?  Of course not - that's not what Kinsella writes.  She's writing so that you can pass the time at the beach or the airport.<br /><br />Recommend.

B003U9TDII|2.0|This soundtrack is effective, if a little detached from the movie's story. However, Mr. Zimmer seems to have re-used the climactic Journey to the Line track from The Thin Red Line soundtrack for the finale of Inception. Time is merely a remixed version of Journey to the Line, a song made by Zimmer 12 years ago. I guess he thought he could get away with re-using a theme song because a decade had passed and not many people remember movie soundtracks; well I definitely will not be remembering this re-hash.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set it up within a minute. Samsung Note 2 immediately recognize the device, then set it up automatically. Video quality totally depends on the video source. Google should have also post a photo of the power source. Not all HDMI ports are close to a USB ports. Otherwise you will need to plug in an AC/DC adapter to power the device.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|When 3 of the original production team decide to remake/reimagine a classic cult film, the expectation is that it should be pretty good.  The original director (Sam Raimi), producer (Rob Tapert) and star (Bruce Campbell) hired Fede Alvarez to update the 1981 film I remember mostly for oceans of blood and satirical humor.<br /><br />In this version Mia (Jane Levy) is coaxed to visit her family cabin in the woods by her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and the usual collection of concerned friends.  All good looking of course and all headed toward doom.  The reason for the sleep-over is an intervention to get Mia off her drug addiction.  When bored Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) uncovers a dusty old book covered in barbed wire, his curiosity gets the best of him...and the rest of the party.  You can pretty much guess the rest as the story just moves from one despicable act to another.<br /><br />Having said that, there is a certain originality to the projectile vomiting, twisted bodies and of course, buckets `o blood.  While the film lacks some of the camp of the original, this one amps up the scare quotient and is quite effective.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  Shot digitally, the film looks very good.  All that blood and bile comes across with excellent color and clarity.  The sharpness is very good.  Check out the detail in the oft seen \\"Book of the Dead.\\"  Excellent black levels provide an stellar picture during the many dark scenes.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless track and it is as good as it gets.  It does a good job replicating the various scenes of hacking, slicing, revving chainsaws, victims screaming and even crickets chirping.  The musical score is well placed and well done.<br /><br />Extras include an audio commentary with Jane Levy, Pucci and Jessica Lucas (nurse and friend Olivia), and 5 \\"making of\\" features.  There are the requisite Sony trailers and a UV digital copy.

B00A8KJN14|4.0|Director Tim Burton takes his live 30 minute film from 1984 and expands it to 87 minutes using his wonderful stop-motion figures similar to those of \\"Nightmare Before Christmas.\\"  Borrowing heavily from the original 1931 \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" (1935) in terms of character names and physical appearance, Burton produces a film that kids and their parents can all enjoy.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) is a middle school kid who stays within himself but has a thirst for science.  His faithful companion is a dog (bull terrier?) named Sparky.  They are always together except when Victor is at school.  Unfortunately Sparky being a dog, likes to chase balls.  One such chase leads him into the street and in front of a car.  Victor is disconsolate as you might expect.<br /><br />In science class, Victor's science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (an homage to Vincent Price voiced by Martin Landau), animates a dead frog using electricity.  This gives Victor the idea of doing the same with Sparky.  Working alone in the attic of the house he shares with his parents (Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short), Victor's experiment works.  As Victor's wannabe friend Edgar `E' Gore (Atticus Shaffer) says \\"your dog is alive!\\"<br /><br />In one cute scene, Sparky nuzzles up to the lady poodle that lives next door.  The poodle that has a mountain of hair trimmed into a cone.  After a nose touch, the lady poodle has those white lightning bolt streaks that appear on Elsa Lanchester's \\"Bride\\" of years ago.  Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) is the name of the little girl that owns the poodle.  When further experiments on various dead creatures owned by Victor's classmates goes horribly wrong, the fun begins.<br /><br />Burton and his screenwriter, John August keep the gruesomeness at a PG level and introduce enough moral-of-the-story awareness to keep the film wholesome enough for most family members.  I loved the wit and the pastiche to the stories of Mary Shelley.  Not to mention the beautiful black and white picture supplied on the Blu ray.<br /><br />With a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the movie looks spectacular.  Contrast and fine detail prevails throughout the film.  This is as good as it gets, as is the terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.  Good use of the LFE channel is deep when it needs to be and silent when it doesn't.  Dialog is well placed and always centered properly.  Extras include a documentary called \\"Miniatures in Motion\\" and a 5 minute piece displaying the excellent art work of the film.  There is also the original live action short, a music video and more.mention the beautiful black and white picture supplied on the Blu ray.<br /><br />With a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the movie looks spectacular.

B00BEIYMAG|4.0|So do we really need another ghost story movie?  Well, maybe if it is as good as this one.  Directed by James Wan who may be best known for \\"Saw\\" of torture porn fame, the film relies more on good old fashion suspense, tension and yes, some traditional movie scare tactics.  As they say, the story is based on true events.<br /><br />This time paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are hired to help the Perron family who just purchased a fixer upper home in rural Rhode Island.  Roger (Ron Livingston) is a trucker and his wife, Carolyn (Lily Taylor) a stay at home mom with 5 daughters ranging from about 6 to 16.  Before they can even get settled they begin to hear things that go bump in the night.<br /><br />As usual, the events start small.  Smells, rattling pipes, thumping, etc.  Over time, things get more serious including possession.  Wan, to his credit, eschews the gore for character development which includes not only the Perron family but the Warrens who are reluctantly drawn in.  What makes this ghost story more interesting is that it relies less on jump scares and more on constant tension.  The finale is as good an exorcism as there ever was, including the granddaddy of them all, \\"The Exorcist.\\"  Nice performances by all involved helps make this a memorably frightening time at the movies.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I don't have much to add to what has been said already.  Everything about this album is great: musicianship, vocals, production.  I hope these guys keep this project going.  I've been listening to the autorip version while waiting for my CD to arrive.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I downloaded this book onto my tablet therefore there is not a comment I can make about the shipping, but I enjoy being able to use the service.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I can read my office documents on my android, and with the limitations of the keyboard, do some editing.  It works just as well with Excel. I don't think that I have tried Powerpoint.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|love the alarm it is loud and wakes me up!  The only complaint that I have is that it sometimes doesn't go off.  Hopefully they can fix that.  Worth the purchase though.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|While I don't use this much, the 30 dollar purchase price made it worthwhile. Similar bags by others can be over $100. If you are only going to use it from time to time- get the Basics. It works, it's relatively comfortable, it has room for a multilens DSLR outfit, plus a few other things (socks and aspirin).
B001FB55H6|4.0|Watchmen isn't another Spiderman, Ironman or Avengers movie. The movie follows the comic books and you don't need to have read them to understand the story. If you have read the comic books you'll understand the nuances of the story allot better.
