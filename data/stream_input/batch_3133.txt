B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Good guilty pleasure, but fell short compared to the 50 Shades series. I would recommend if you like this genre.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This is hands down, the best drama I've ever seen in my life.<br />I'm not going to say anything more than that.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I have tried all the other music apps and they either continually lock up after playing for 20-30 minutes or their mixes are terrible.  In my opinion this is the first music app that has done exactly what it describes; plays only the music you want, uninterrupted and is hassle free.  This is just one of two five star ratings I have given an app in over a year; it is that good.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|This was a terrible remake. But as a film, it was one of the best I watched in 2013. I loved the gore and the violence. I thought that the possessions were really brutal too, the actors nailed it. If you're a huge fan of the original, you're going to hate this. Its not the same movie, it just has the same name and a lot of similarities, but its a new beast.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Good movie.  Nice prequel to the original.  Both my boys (ages 8 and 10) liked it.  Seemed a bit long in the middle to me, but the kids did not complain.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I absolutely give 5  stars to this games. Everything looks perfect to me, you name it: the sound, graphics event the tutorials. Specifically it easy to play.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Just another great animated movie.. Perfect for the kids.great price... I highly recommend to others. I'm sure I'll be buying more movies like this.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Well hard but fun you get to be samoraui or zombies the people are hard but it gives you get a lot of charms when u beat the first level it's cool I give it a 4 star rating cause it's hard but great game
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|There is always a special place in my heart for Caiman's books. The are a joy to read and I always know it's going to be a fun ride from start to finish. This one did not disappoint.
B00FEVYYUM|5.0|the chapters i´ve seen, online, are amazing. I love all the seasons, i love the show, i love the books and i love Nina Ian And paul, All the actors are great, and their voices and acting amazing. Although i´m a native spanish speaker i love the series in oiginal version, english, because i love their voices. I even met once ian, nina and paul and i love them. I would like to see them again. I would buy all the seasons if it wasn´t for the price, that´s why i see the episodes online, because it´s expensive but i would love to have all the seasons in dvd, although i ndon´t know if this dvd works in europe, where i live.<br /> i recommend this series, for me is the best tv show that i´ve ever seen. It´s amazing. I´m looking forward everyweek to watch the next eppisode.
B00000G28U|5.0|I love this CD. I had the same one, but I borrowed it to my son. He loved it too, and I could never get it back from him. I checked on Amazon then, and I found it at a great price. I got such a good deal that I let him keep my 1st one and I got another one for myself. Amazon is always there for what I need.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the Trilogy because, it felt like you were in the book when I was reading it!!! I haven&#34;t see the movies yet but, my sister-in-law have and said, it was different than the book.The book came in handy when we had a hurricane  and a earthquake here about 3 years ago!!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|When I first began this series, I noticed how much lower the ratings were for the third book compared to the first two. And after finishing this series, I now understand why. This series is wonderful, and tragic, and beautiful and terrible all at once. Roth not only captured my imagination with her world, she created characters with real depth and conflict, so much that I found myself rooting for them, crying with them, and falling in love with them. What's more, Roth was not afraid to \\"upset\\" her readers by sticking to her guns and finishing this series as she began it: RAW. There is no sugar-coating, no fairytale-ing, no lets-all-hold-hands-and-everything-just-works-out-perfectly-ing. There is just the story and her courage to stick to it as honestly as she could. If you are the type of person who can watch a movie that makes you laugh and cry and STILL walk away appreciating the depth of the story, you will not be \\"disappointed\\" by this series. If you always need a story to finish like a Pixar film, walk away.<br /><br />I also think the realism and depth of the storyline/charaters is why the movie won't suck. For anyone that's curious: [...]
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun way to unwind after work. Not very hard, fun for all ages. I would<br />recommend for anyone looking to relax.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so cool and finally on kindle fire hd. Dont listen to the bad reviews because this game is awesome and addictive.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is a movie you can watch over and over again with your kids and grandkids!  This can become one of your Christmas traditions.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive and different from other mat h three games.  Good for the developers.  Hope there will be sequels or more levels
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very fun. I hate that the energy runs out so quickly but other than that a completely worthwhile investment of time.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Hungry Shark Evolution is probably the most addicting game I have.  It took me about over a month, but I got to the Great White Shark! BTW Megalodon costs 900 gems, so save them!  This is the first game that meets all of my expectations: I get the full version, it is not boring, and its freeeeeeeeeee! Get it right now, a d don't waste your time on the other version. They are absolutely horrible.  I downloaded this one first, then tried the others and was extremely disappointed.  The point is, get it now!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game to past the time.I cant wait for other levels.attn husband if you go shoe shopping with wife play this game
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Exactly what I expected...really enjoy every song!Talent is so clear in this persons works...keep growing and sharing with us! True talent
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is very addictive and fun. Endless hours of entertainment, it feels like your almost in the game and controlling the robot.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game. Have enjoyed it.<br /><br />Can get a bit annoying when you have to stop to review it.  only 10 levels though
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is awesome but it crashed and is showing something funny. If you guys could fix this problem i would be happy.
B0001ADB8C|3.0|The &#34;Somewhere In England&#34; disk was missing from the case. I think I already own this cd from a previous individual purchase, but I certainly feel cheated, since it was not included as part of this collection, as was advertised.
140006922X|4.0|Riveting and probably on the cusp of blasphemy, which, in a dark way, attracts our attention!  You won't hear much of what Reza Aslan writes in Zealot in Sunday School.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|I love this game it's the best man game in the world the best team is Miami heat because of lebron James I also like John wall
0316322407|5.0|Well-written, unique story, amazing young woman! will surely be heard from in the future -- hope she will be safe
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is one of the best games I have tried yet if you love fighting or robots you will love this game
B001RTSPVY|5.0|You'll be hooked by the end of this season.  Great acting, plenty of surprises, and a great ending to this season.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I think the second time through was better than the first.  Great trio and an excellent story. I love these books.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|Not as insightful as his previous books. A bit preachy. Went downhill from the titled first story. An uneven book.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan. I'm also a fan of Will Smith & his son Jaden Smith too. The acting was good - as I expected. I would have liked to see a little more of Will Smith.  I thought the story was well written with some good interaction between the characters. It does have an underlying environmental preachiness but all in all a good &#34;watch at home&#34; movie.
B002QVZ71I|1.0|painful movie to watch.  absolutely hate this film.  it haunts me every time I hear some idiot say &#34;run, forrest, run!&#34; or I see a bubba gump restaurant.  try anything else but ghost.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My older girls love this game, it is nice to use in the car on trips and while sitting in the doctor or dentist office waiting.
B00E9ZATTY|4.0|The video quality of this blu-ray is perfect, of course, as it's a digital transfer.  But I enjoyed the prequel and felt it is best enjoyed in HD certainly.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Just right for my small 4/3 mirrorless camera.  Lets me store the camera, and a spare lens.  The movable interior divide cna be changed to fit the camra with a telephoto or the standard lens and the other lens fits then in the other side of the compartment.  Room for spare batteries and camera cards in the sides and the lid.  Both velcro and a sturdy zipper to keep the lid closed, depending on if you need quick access to the camera or not.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A good SK book, but not my favorite. It took awhile to become interested in the story line, but by the end it seemed more \\"Kingish\\" to me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really like it. I know it doesn't support a bunch of apps yet but the movies we've watch using chromecast have been fantastic and look extremely high def. Great addon for my tablet and tv especially for the price.
0385350864|1.0|I have never felt as mad at an author as I do at Helen Fielding and this book.  I loved Bridget Jones...one of my very favorite characters over the years.  I'm not upset that she killed off Mark Darcy.  I heard it before I started to read the book and while not thrilled I figured it could lead to some interesting places for Bridget.  Well, I've been trying to read the book and can't get through it because I'm starting to not like the main character.  You would figure after having a happy marriage with Mark and two children that she might of matured a bit.  There is hardly any emotional growth for Bridget.  At 50 she sounds like the same confused 30 year old she was in the previous books.  It was charming at 30, not so much at 50.  I feel like sometimes she is a bad mother.  I had to stop reading it because frankly it was boring and making me mad.  Don't waste your money on this.  RIP Bridget Jones...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have one on every one of my TVs and one for travel and have had one since they were first offered and they are awesome!<br /><br />They do operate best with native apps like Google Music and Movies and Netflix, but you can cast webpages as well. I like the fact that my phone becomes a remote, controlling the content and the volume. Last night I couldn't sleep so just cast one of my favorite Netflix shows to the bedroom TV and I was set!<br /><br />A good wireless connection is required; I had to put a repeater in for my TV farthest from my Netgear AC1750 but once your phone and Chrome cast are on your network, set up is easy. If you have multiples like me, give them good descriptive names so you don't end up casting to the wrong one! I'd recommend setting it up from the desktop  app (if you have a desktop)...it seems to be easier that way, to me at least.<br /><br />They do blink when they are receiving updates; if you wake up in the middle of the night and the back of your TV is blinking, that's what it is. I'd like the option of turning that off.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more apps!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Brilliant game keeps me entertained for hours .  Gets harder as you get further in but keeps you on your t o rd.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is useful but the thing that pissed me off is the fact that you cant search for videos aleast is what they can do is make a genre thing because I'm pissed of that I have to scroll down just to freaking get the video that I might want to get.  so all I'm saying is that you should wait till they make it better bye
B0086HGW42|5.0|I bought this album for one song, but ended up loving every song on the album. I got it at a great price too.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am,,very disappointed with this story. The English have words for this, \\"a penny dreadful.\\"  Pure female fantasy.  REPETITIVE to the point of boring.
B0063IH60K|2.0|It is kinda fun but I think it is more like something you would do if you were bored.I thought it would be fun but it isn't really.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I hear the TV deal is awesome.  The book, on the other hand, fell short of tantalizing or even &#34;good.&#34;  It just was one of those things where I sat there and thought &#34;Why bother?  What's your message?  Better prisons?&#34;  No thanks.  Orange is Orange.  And Orange ain't that pretty.  No trick there.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|My whole family is going to love this game! The graphics are amazing and the controls are simple to use. Love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an addictive game, but it is kinda nice to have that wait time between lives so you can get other things done.
B00770KR7W|4.0|i got it for a christmas present it seemed to be in great condition and all and i got it fairly quick. I would say they did a fair job.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game. I plan on trying other g5 games like it. I also like that this game is free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses, so I love this app. It's pretty realistic and awesome. It's a lot of fun to play
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The book is very readable. Interesting, with engaging characters. However, it all seems too easy for the &#34;good guys&#34;, and therefore a bit disappointing and unconvincing in the end.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After reading the first two Crossfire Novels and then waiting for what seemed like FOREVER for Entwined with You, just to have the release day pushed back another month, I was highly disappointed with Entwined with You. Don't get me wrong, I love Sylvia Day's writing, but after some point it's just another erotic romance. I ended up not finishing it after I got board with all the constant banging and compulsive behavior- complete with a massive outbreak of complaints that there would be a 4th book. Sylvia Day got a little stingy and was worried about proceeds from a 4th book instead of finally giving closure the series for all her fans. I think if she started out with the intent and advertising of only 3 books she should have kept it at that. I have no desire to read through the 3rd to dangle around waiting on the 4th, just to find out there will be a 5th. No thanks- it's not about the money I would spend on the books, but rather a long, drawn out over processed story line.<br /> Greed can kill a great series quick!
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Nice story, good action scenes and the as a sequel it stayed with the original theme. The HD stream completed with out any drop out during the entire movie.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This is a truly heart-felt story that not only is classified as a romance but also deserves the tag of 'tear-jerker'! Very well-written, clean and contemporary, young adult, romance!<br /><br /> If you liked Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire, then you will love Easy by Tammera Webber! It was so great I included it on my list of &lt;a href= \\"http://stephaniesbookshelf.blogspot.com/2013/03/top-5-books-like-beautiful-disaster.html\\"> Top Books Like Beautiful Disaster&lt;/a>
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely marvelous. After finishing this novel, I felt many different emotions. Green's words are chosen pefrectly and honestly, I found myself crying at some parts. Somehow I wish there was more to their love, more I could know. I highly recommend this novel!
1465012796|4.0|It was for my 11 year old Granddaughter, who loves Taylor Swift but she was a little disappointed because she thought she was getting an Aurora Plush Animal but she is a busy 11 year old and she so she decided it was a good gift to keep track of all of her school schedules and activities. It is on the desk in her bedroom. I liked it.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was a very enjoyable read even though the plot was a bit predictable. The author does a fine job of toggling back and forth between several main characters, none of whom felt especially real to me, but since the story was engaging enough to hold my attention I enjoyed it. Overall, pretty solid chick lit, but as long as you know that's what you're getting you won't be disappointed.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|My favorite part of this series are the men of the nights watch. I was disappointed in the killing off of Ned Stark so early and would like to see Jeffrey get what he deserved. I have not read the books, but the series does provide some entertainment value. I find the constant tension between clans to gain power a bit boring and a little predictable, though I would not mind seeing Cersei Lannister thrown off the castle peak, her character I find a bit despicable and hateful.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|The greatest book is Cabin Fever *****=five stars I'm amazed how good it is I love love love it .
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|good movie and a gift to my fiancee, its was a christmas gift from last years been looking for it for long time
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game. Play it while my daughter helps. She loves helping mommy and its educational. However, it is a bit addictive. :)
B00BAXFECK|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, this epic tale describes the interplay between bad and good, and how what we think of as bad behaviour (drugs, thievery, even murder) does not exist in a vaccuum; that bad can inexplicably lead to good because some of us live under the influence of saints in our midst (though we don't recognize them as such, as we only magnify their flaws).<br /><br />How good is this book? I don't read with my glasses on, I put them on the floor next to my chair. I got up to get a cup of tea and stepped on my glasses, crushing the chassis. I was momentarily flustered and then returned to the book because I had to know what happened next. Literally this book had me under its spell.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Just when you think you have figured it out there is a new twist. Happiness and sadness in the end.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This classic is a terrific comedy of manners. It's not quite her best work. Some of the characters are boring or annoying, which is not a problem in itself, but because she quotes from them at some length from time to time, that makes those parts of the book also boring or annoying. But skim those parts, and appreciate the subtle wit, complex characters and deft plotting, and you will probably enjoy the book greatly.
B004M8S3Y6|2.0|I could have really enjoyed this book... except for the fact that I am a woman, and this is a sexist, misogynistic, piece of tripe.<br /><br />It seems to have been pieced together from several unrelated articles and follows no real, coherent pattern.<br /><br />That said there is some good information in there, once you get past the author proclaiming his sexual prowess, and his ability to make any woman orgasm in 15 minutes.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Fast paced, lovely photography, good dialogue, thoughtful content, make it fun to watch.<br />Thoughtful enough to leave  you with a few questions to ponder.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't think I would like the game. But I have enjoyed it so far...Though not an addict of the game, I can pass through time quickly while playing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this crazy book. Way crazier than expected. Very sexual to say the least. Well worth reading! I read it when I went with my hubby on a working vacation. I spent my afternoons on the beach reading it up and sucking up the sun in peace and solitude. Made my vacation all the more better!
B000QUEQBI|5.0|Great story and above all, tons of action. This picture is so good , I watch it at least 4 0r 5 times a year.
B007KYQIEQ|4.0|Love the movie, but it gets a bit corny at the end. Still a great story. Great for kids and adults who like romance or time travel movies.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This movie is timeless. It is the number 1 movie on my list of all time. I watch this movie about 7 times a year. I am sure<br />everyone in the US and overseas has probably seen this movie. I can't say enough about this movie. It,s the classic<br />of all movies, a must see. I don't know of anyone that has not liked this movie.
B009GED3HS|5.0|What can I say. This is one of the best TV series to hit the idiot box! I didn't start watching it when it first came on TV. I think I actually started watching when season 6 was on I was watching season 1. Love, love, love it. It is best to watch from the very beginning. If you make the mistake of jumping in the middle of the show then you run the risk of not understanding a lot of fun idiosyncrasies. It is easy to fall in love with the characters and feel what they are feeling. The series takes you on a journey and leads to some unexpected endings. It's heartwarming and fun to watch. Highly recommended!!!!
0783225857|5.0|What a classic picture. The charactures in this picture are enthrallling, It's such a delight to see a picture that captures your<br />heart. I watch this movie about 4 times a year, Truely a masterpiece.
B00E978FGQ|2.0|Must not have been very good because I know I watched it and I can't remember it. I guess it did not leave a lasting impression. Asked my husband who watched it with me and he said the same thing. We aren't that old...
B0001GMIOE|4.0|Works like a charm, great product. Canon battery does work better than an knock off oem for some reason.  I will be getting more.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Love, love, love these crazy books. A few things start getting dragged out and I wish there was more reaching into his psyche and a little more emotionally deep rather than repetitive. All in all I recommend it.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Great story -- compelling and honest; I couldn't put it down. This is one I'll read again and again. So glad to have found it.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|This is one of the better scary movies I've seen in recent years. If you like um scary this ones worth getting.
0307266303|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible and inspiring. I read this book two years ago, but the characters and stories still stay with me and compel me to run. I bought the five-finger shoes because of the story of Barefoot Ted in this book. It has also enhanced my enjoyment of running and helped me to feel energized about the exercise even when the environmental conditions aren't perfect.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|You can't go wrong with Disney Pixar! This movie is on our &#34;Classic&#34; list. All ages enjoy this fun story of &#34;monsters&#34;.(I even named my puppy Cinnamon Sullivan...Sulley for short!)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This final book of the Divergent series is a rollercoaster ride. So much happens from the very beginning and there isn't much time to stop and think- for the characters or the reader. This book more than the others show Tris and Four's true colors. It's a difficult and great ending to an intense series. Not everyone will agree, but even in fiction sometimes the story needs to remain real and true. It will be interesting to see how these stories play out in the movies. I'm sure they'll do Tris justice.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|This is a new addition to our all time favorite Christmas movies. Everyone enjoys this story of the Christmas spirit.
B000002U82|5.0|A classic.  It was a replacement for the one I had that somehow got stepped on.  I bought this originally on 8 track when it came out.  I loved it then and I love it now.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Gift
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read.<br />Interesting story and excellent character development.<br />John Grishman never fails To deliver what a reader wants!<br />I flew through this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad that Candy Crush has finally made it to Kindle! Now I can play it on a bigger screen. The only thing is that my lives don't sync with the lives on my phone.  I have less lives on Kindle.
B00D48BSBA|3.0|Its quite a simple story with a few minor twists. There are a lot of details which make the tale lengthy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A Great Grisham book.  The Characters and the story are very rich and  believable.  The book makes  you want to keep reading.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This had great action scenes and great storyline.  Although Batman is a character that doesn't lend itself to more development than what he is, the writer's made a great villain and tied him to Batman's past very nicely.
0385537131|5.0|Another winning title, &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;, is a John Grisham &#34;Must Read&#34;.  It is a sequel to his earliest novel, &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;, and the two are easily read in sequence.  The theme is that of the same protagonist, Jake Brigance, the attorney who magically pulls the rabbits out of a hat just at the right moment.  He is kind of a superman in the literary sense.  I refuse to elaborate on the story in order not to spoil the outcome, but the characters are believable, and the legal lingo is easily digested.  Don't miss this exciting addition to your Grisham collection of cases.  I feel that a movie is around the corner with both stories incorporated into one.<br />Dale Blair Haufrect
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Outstanding band...outstanding music...they might be headlining a new direction in rock n roll...<br />I have both of their CD's and watched the &#34;At Red Rocks&#34; concert....they put on a damn good show...<br />Very entertaining...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The first book that John Grisham wrote A TIME TO KILL was to me the best book he had ever written until I read SYCAMORE ROW.  It is just as good as A TIME TO KILL.  I had this book on my Kindle and read it on a trip to North Carolina for my grandson's wedding.  I read the entire book on the trip, just could not put it down.  He is an excellent writer especially when he writes about the state where he grew up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have not read a bad book by John Grisham, this one is real good.  Can't wait to read what he does next.  Thanks
B0024Y9F1K|3.0|The show isn't bad.  The story is ok and I can't complain.  The only character I don't like is John Connor.  I understand he is suppose to be a angsty teenager, but the writers dumb him down too much.  He is way too under cautious for a person who has almost lost his life multiple times.  The writers should have been more creative in bringing danger to him instead of making him a dumb little puppy running into traffic all the time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book woke up my mind. It thrilled me and made me hunger to read more. It's pure genius. I wish I could find more characters like this. It's hard to think of something others haven't said, but it was so important for me to voice how wonderful l think this book is. I'd never read it until I saw the movie. I guess my curiosity caught fire and continued from there. I reviewed the movie in more detail, since I wasn't lost in hundreds who reviewed before me.
1250038820|4.0|This is a beautiful book.  Some of the descriptions which are printed over the photos are a bit difficult to read, but that is my only (very minor) complaint.  I hope Brandon publishes a sequel with more of the longer stories he is collecting on the web page.<br /><br />I bought two copies - one for myself, and one to give as a gift.  My only regret was not buying more than two copies.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|I hate to give bad reviews but if you buy this looking for the Ender you cared so much about in the first book, be warned, they're not the same character, not even the same quality. Not even close! The first novel was full of genius and spirit and the energy of imagination. And not just because Ender was a child, but because the writer was in touch with a more uninhibited creativity that was pure brilliance! But this book moves like a slug, weighted down by the author's heavy-handed religion and moral concerns to the point of being a huge, long drawn out sermon. So painful and disappointing, Ender as a grown man is written with such a dry, theological slant. He bears no resemblance to the exciting genius he was before. The earing that let Ender communicate with the ansible was about the only thing I liked.  The sad part is that the author probably is a genius whose conscience and self-judgment got the better of him, so he decided to write what he thinks is &#34;right&#34; instead of what is truly moving. What's funny is that the first novel, Ender's Game, was a perfect beacon of morality and insight, just by telling a great story. There wasn't one sermon, and yet it moved me to excitement and quiet reflection. This book, I forced myself to get through it and knew I couldn't go any further in the series. I'm still amazed at how bad it was. How is that even possible?
B007BVOEPI|2.0|This is a tawdry series that is more about female nudity and illicit sex than the story line. I don't mind a little raunch, but give me a break! Raunch is. The essence of Game of Thrones.
B00AGYM0DU|5.0|Interesting structure, multiple stories flow well constructed, mystery, presented life/culture as it is in Japan.<br />Interesting characters, reasonably well paced read.

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|connecting to Facebook shouldn't be required to complete missions and then the only way to pass c them is to spend crowns. absolutely stupid and unnecessary. what about the people without Facebook? what will they do?
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|Excellent action packed movie- keeps the viewer guessing and Matt Damon is excellent as Jason Bourne! A definite must see !
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, and the actual plane had just visited Columbia Owens field, it was a thrill to see the real plane
B00C5R71U8|2.0|By all accounts Jony Ive is a soft-spoken man who avoids the spotlight.  This book sheds little light.<br /><br />I was hoping for deeper insights into Apple's design process.  But there's nothing in this book that can't be found in Walter Isaacson's superb biography of Steve Jobs.  In fact, nearly all of the quotes from Jony are from either (1) Apple product videos or (2) Isaacson's biography.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book - I'm a big fan of Ive's design philosophy and aesthetic.  But this is one to skip.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is a freaking great sequel to the first one. It's got aliens, pirates, and freaking crazy New towers. I've been playing for two days strait now! Can't stop, I need help :p
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game.  I was so happy when it became available for the kindle fire.  Its so great. Inoperable to see more like this. I love being able to play offline then able to compare my score with others when I am online. this is such a fun game.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This was an awesome book.  Twists and turns at every corner.  It kept me guessing and intrigued for hours.  I loved it and looking forward to reading more Swank books.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Even though this was on for only two seasons, it captures the total essence of good vs evil - with a twist.  I love the faithfulness to ones=self of the characters, despite their human emotions.  The evolution of the characters is not expected, thus making this much more dynamic.  For those who like this genre, it is well worth the purchase.
1476729085|5.0|The simplest answer is usually correct.<br /><br />Don Tillman is wired differently, completely oblivious to social cues and tact.  He is a geneticist at a distinguished university in Melbourne and he decided that it is time to find a wife.  Thus, the Wife Project.  Set in his ways, Professor Tillman does not set out in a usual manner.  He has devised a questionnaire.  Important qualifications include items like mathematical acuity, the ability to distinguish ice cream flavors, punctuality, non-smoker, non-drinker, a proper body mass index, etc.  Obviously, not a standard dating profile.  Then again, Don is not your average person.<br /><br />After 250 or so responses, with no candidates, Don asks his best friend Gene, a world-class lothario, for help with the project.  One day Rosie knocks on his door.  Don is a bit taken aback since she fits no set perimeters.  Maybe Gene knows more since he has a project of his own – involving bedding one woman from every country.  To Don’s lack of experience, that makes Gene more aware of women.<br /><br />Turns out Rosie has a project of her own.  The Dad Project.  Rosie is convinced that her dad is not really her biological father and Don, being a geneticist, just might be able to help her.<br /><br />Of course, that does not come out right away and as Don is trying to figure out how Gene would find Rosie to be “wife material”, Rosie is becoming more obsessed with finding dear old dad and Don is becoming infatuated - since falling in love and empathy is not on his Autism Spectrum capability wheel.<br /><br />Thus begins their humorous odyssey of tracking down and DNA testing the possible men that could be Rosie’s father.  Don trying desperately to figure out a complicated world that involves emotions and love.  Gene and his wife Claudia trying to find a common ground and the Dean of the University coming to the end of her rope.<br /><br />You will laugh, especially at the part involving the skeleton from the anatomy department; you will become frustrated, and you will begin comparing people that you have met with Don.  I do not know if you will become more empathetic to Don’s plight or not, but you just might see the world involving a Standardized Meal System and to the minute scheduling a bit differently.  Much like Don has to see his world differently.department; you will become frustrated, and you will begin comparing people that you have met with Don.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|For those who love the true romance of the 'Old World', this is a perfect movie.  It may not follow the 'political correctness' of movie making.....but those who love the good vs evil, true love wins in the end, it is a nice movie.  When it comes on tv, I play it even though I have the DVD.  The best saying is &#34;HUNT HER DOWN&#34;.......which ultimately is Evil's downfall.  This movie is superb in its special effects.  I highly recommend it to those who love this genre.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it a lot it works very well. I have it on my Kindle and it is large and easy to see.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't wait for the next book. This is a series worthy of comparing to Lord of the rings. I wish I knew when the next one is coming out.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|This game Is  the one of the most realistic driving games I've ever played. I also think that it is not addictive like other games that try to suck you in.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|First: I loved the show. I saw this at my local library, and I had to read it. OMG. This is NOTHING like the show. The Piper on the show is at least likable. I worked inside a prison. I know how it is. I'm not near as in awe as Piper Kerman thinks you should be. At least, you should be in awe of her. She's a snob, at best. Besides that, the writing is poor, the story lost in the description of all her bourgeois attitudes and privileges while in prison, and there's no climax and denouement. There is only her, and her selfish worldview.<br /><br />Very disappointing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|great read better than the others so glad my sister told me to read it  Not my usual read GREAT
0792164903|5.0|how could you not like johny dep!!now we know this is not how it was written but!! the dark village with its miserbale new york weather much like here today! its a favortie of ours to see at halloween time.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy jigsaw puzzles at home...though with kids it is often difficult ...now I can enjoy puzzles on the go and not loose any pieces ...yeah.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This book describes a technological giant run amok. There's a very fine line between what advances are available to us today and those described by the author in this book. The protagonist is a young woman who, in the beginning, walks a delicate tight rope between being given over totally to technological advances and being nurtured by closing herself away from all technology, kayaking open waters when she's stressed. When she gets her dream job at The Circle-a computer based juggernaut which encompasses all parts of life – her life begins to change in amazing ways. Her relationships with three different men, each of whom represents a different kind of relationship with technology, illustrate the different kinds of outcomes our relationships with our computers and mobile devices could have. Unfortunately the ending is a bit pat and and it requires the readers to have a greater depth of suspension of disbelief then I, for one, was able to muster. This could've been a five-star satire along the lines of Animal Farm but the author lacks subtlety. Nevertheless, it is a good read and I do recommend it. Also right after the book concludes, there is an excellent set of questions for book clubs or other groups to discuss and/or to stimulate the readers own thinking.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|The scenes, interviews and explanations made this series intriguing.  I'd like to see the show based on this introduction and feel that I understood why it is so popular.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I kept seeing this app advertised and have finally given it a try. So far it is very addictive! And for free you can't beat the price!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Amazing game! Now that they add the pork side, this can't get any better! I recommend the shadow trooper for your permanent pork side character. He's AWSOME! Not as AWSOME as hologram darth sidious, but still he's cool.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'll tell you how good it is: There are several plot lines, according to different protagonists. It's so good I had to follow such line to the end of the book as I had to know what happens to the hero. Then I returned to the missed chapters and they were STILL terrific read!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I'm 13 and I love this game.I also think that it has a good message some people die acting dumb.I love playing it its super fun and has a catchy song.one more thing for people who don't want to lose a life because of the airplane go to edgings and turn it off.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Wow, what a major difference the re-mixing of this album has made. It is at times like removing giant wads of toilet paper from your ears - all these new, clear sounds! At other times it can seem like an almost-different song. Drums and bass, which were close to a sonic wall in the original mix, are now distinct and sharp, able to be heard cleanly. The effect is to realize what an energetic set of songs this album delivers - and I thought they were pretty energetic before the re-mix! It's true that the guitar steps back a bit, but in my opinion (and I am a guitarist, and predisposed to wanting more of the instrument) the guitar now sits right where it should in the mix. Geddy's voice is more intelligible, though the lyrics did not suffer nearly like the instruments in the original mix. There are many, many instruments and effects that I can now hear that I never noticed on the original. It seems there is so much more going on - the original album was not nearly as simple as I thought, but I had not noticed the complexity due to the overpowering sonic wall. All that said, I loved Vapor Trails in its original form and did not have the complaints about a terrible mixing (or mastering) job, so this is all written from the perspective of someone that wasn't irritated or unsatisfied with the original. I just think that the re-mix offers a set of songs that are far, far better at representing what Rush is capable of recording and on an absolute basis the songs are now much more listenable - in the very real sense that my ears could actually get tired listening to some of the original recordings but now I doubt that will happen. I have purchased several re-mastered Rush compact discs (Signals does sound a bit better) but this is by far the best money spent on buying a second 'copy' of a Rush album. Hooray for whomever led the effort to make this happen!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I have only just got this app, so haven't used it properly, but so far, I love it!<br />It is so fantastic to have all the different paints, pencils, album etc., there<br />to draw and paint with, all on a small, light to carry around, tablet!  Thank you<br />to the creator of this!  Lesley D. Somerset
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent drama - a bit of a soap opera.  Love the accents and learning a bit about Britain in the early 1900's. Can't wait for season 4.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|The game is simple pure fun for everyone. I recommend seeing the movie first. It really helps with understanding the story and the purpose of the game.
B00AQB2A3I|2.0|This album is a bunch of sparkly paper wrapped nicely around an empty box. This album features nice enough production of absolutely nothing interesting neither musically nor lyrically. Songs are pointless and uninspired, apparently Wilson can write interesting material and he is a decent instrumentalist even though a monotonous singer. I Would rather listen to the underproduced  demos of an album from a band with decent songwriting skills than this. The sad thing is that prog is supposed to be creative not monotonous. Maybe Wilson should stick to remixing and remastering stuff.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|Sadly...pretty damn good! I thought it would be a flop...for obvious reason! But pretty damn good. Actually good enough to deserve a sequel.
B007WR32XG|5.0|Stellar performance for those that can appreciate the chaos vdgg can harness. Totally recommended for every adventurous  fan of prog rock, even though mastermind PH sounds a little strained at times. Not recommended if you're into pop-prog like Modern day Marillion or Wilson's raven disc.
B005HED08I|5.0|I loved the explanation of the whole thing made it extra fun to watch. Trekies of the world are making more with this pilot :)
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Is a good movie, but wasn't as exciting as others of Grisham's.  Was well cast, and DeVito's humor was the best part.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Phew... This was a long one, at times a bit stretched, but it was still a captivating read. Take your time, read through it follow the characters and be rewarded.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Don't use it often, but nice to have.  Has some nice features, and the weather function is useful.  It's easy to use too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have read many books about the Holocaust.  This is a new point of view.  When we look at war and humanity, there are so many ways we are cruel and so many ways we love.  I am still wiping away the tears.  Read this book...
B00GIXWXEO|4.0|My kids loved it. I thought it had some very funny parts.  It is one of those movies you have to wait to see it when it comes out of the theater.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it is a very fun additive app; but you must pay to pass level seven. but i still love the game
B00094ARZ0|3.0|Very lame movie.  A poorly written script, weak acting, and if it wasn't for the nudity it would be totally boring.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time! I could not put the darn thing down! I would recommend this book to everyone!
B007SGM084|2.0|could have reduced to one book and 3/4 of the nasty removed and the point would have still been there.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|The app is okay it gets great pics and good videos but you have to by camcoins to use the video. I needed one that was free. Sorry just not the best.
1400069289|3.0|Challenging for challenging minds. People who want to scratch the surface of understanding habits.<br />Looking for and ok read this is the book.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was a very heart wrenching trilogy. I was disturbed at the way it ended but also think it's definitely something to think about. Like The Hunger Games, it told a very realistic story that people should think about.
0374275637|3.0|The book is good but not a page burner. I bought it at the request of a student who thought I'd like it.
B0000E6XH3|4.0|A fun romp with great animation and sweet tunes. Leiji Matsumoto's old-school character designs are memorable, although some scenes are certainly better-designed than others. Ultimately, a relic from when anime was still cool.
1616550414|5.0|This is a must have for every Zelda fan, i love it. I think that spots the Legend of Zelda as a modern mith and like the old miths, nothing is so clear.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Kevin Costner makes a great Wyatt Earp.  Dennis Quaid plays a decent Doc Holiday althought I prefer Val Kilmer from 'Tombstone' .<br /><br />Overall a very entertaining movie.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|What more can you say?  All the great Bond themes, from the original artist's, and an extra CD with more music from each Bond movie. Adele's wonderful &#34;Skyfall' is absent. But I added it through iTunes.
0981951252|5.0|Great to listen to while I am driving.  I listened to it a few times.  The voice is energetic, so it does not make me sleepy like some other ones.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|If you were feeling all nostalgic about revisiting the world of Bridget Jones, do yourself a favor: save the money and re-read (or re-watch) the original, glorious &#34;Bridget Jones's Diary.&#34; (Amazon's 50% discount on the Kindle edition is telling; I bought it at full price and wish I could get my money back.)<br /><br />I struggled through the first 300 pages of this book, stubbornly determined to finish it, despite the improbability that the fifty-year-old Bridget would behave the same way as the thirty-something Bridget--- only now, in addition to calories, she's counting her lover's text messages. But I can't tell you how bad this book is without giving away a plot point that is exposed in the first twenty pages, so: SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />Helen Fielding kills off Mark Darcy in order to make Bridget single once again, because apparently, Fielding is so limited as a writer that she can only write about Singletons. This in itself would not be a problem if Fielding had any idea how to express serious, profound emotion in her writing. She simply does not have the chops for it. Bridget's suffering is paper-thin, poorly written, hackneyed, etc. Her widowhood never doesn't feel like a manipulative plot device so that Fielding can send crazy ol' Bridget spinning into singledom again.<br /><br />Fielding seems to have her eye on turning in a good film script instead of a good book. From the first appearance of the character Mr. Wallaker, the author shamelessly begs Daniel Craig to star in the inevitable movie adaptation. The book, frankly, is unworthy of him, but as with &#34;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,&#34; perhaps the movie will be better than the source material.<br /><br />The book picks up in the last 60-75 pages, which is why it squeaks by with a two-star review from me.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|I guess I don't like his writing style.  I could not finish it.  A friend of mine recommended it to me...
B000GFLKF8|5.0|Denzel all was play in good movies this one was smart mine games going on tricks and all the above and it was a great movie too love it
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Really good and very insightful and love when justice is done fairly.  Denzel as usual really gets into the character!
B004LWZW24|5.0|A great movie wasnt that scray at all but i like it do i will watch it again to with my two daughters  they dont like scary movies but they will watch this one with mom
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I guess I higher expectations.  The control was not fluid and the graphics are just so, so.  I deleted it.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|this was a gift for a big allman fan, and i could order it online.  i can't attest to the music as i didn't listen to it, but all in all was glad to be able to order online.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good movie with a twist to keep it interesting. Great human interest story where every thing is not as black an white as it appears
B008JFUPK8|1.0|This is a dumb and awful movie.  If the late Christopher Reeve had a traditional burial rather than cremation, he would be turning over in his grave!
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is my favorite biographer.  I have read all of her books and this is one of the best.  She portrays the brilliance of Lincoln, the conflict and tragedy of his personal life, and his leadership in a most readable mannner.  I would wish for many more books from her.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I really didn't know the premise of the movie but figured it would be a good old fashioned shooter/war movie. Guess I should have realized the Z was for Zombie. I generally don't watch movies like this but I thought this movie was great. Very creepy and lots of places to get you to jump in your seat. Worth the watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A well told story of a country lawyer facing a well financed urban law firm. Justice prevails when historical evidence confronts jurors that ties the present with the past.
B000KIPT30|2.0|I tried this product in my home studio.This product does not give balanced volume. One side of the headset plays louder than the other. Also it doesn't give great tone. So if you don't mind those issues i say for the price its a good purchase but if you want a good quality product i wouldn't suggest it.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|The paper camera takes fun images and do so many option to choose from for different types of images..  I feel it is better than the cartoon images
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|Finally a remake that replaces and exceeds the original from 1978. This movie is simply great! Period. Keep in mind it is a action/fiction story about a comic book's superhero. So if you are looking for a coherent to reality, flawless plot you should watch a drama or documentary. If you're looking for entertainment this is a great movie for the whole family.<br /><br />Awesome visual effects, engaging story line, great acting performance and so forth, The bottom line: Watch it alone, with friends or family. Five star from beginning to end.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|If you are planning on buying this, GET IT NOW, the price has already gone up 5 bucks in a week and funimation has there head to far up there ass to make more copies. I will bet this will be just like the out of print bluray
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I'm so annoyed that you have to &quot;Ask Friends&quot; to move to the next levels. I don't get that. Ive been waiting for days to play. I refuse to pay money to advance, so I will be finding a new game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that Kindle finally got Candy Crush!!!I Kept checking to see if it was coming and look it's finally here!! Thank you Amazon Kindle Fire!!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It is a great show!  This won't be the only season you will want to watch - be sure you start from the beginning!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was great. It was really inspiring.  I really loved the characters and description. A great read. Truly amazing. It was really great how somethings just don't matter and more important things do. That's what you need to realize to be a true friend. Love. And I thoughts  that this really showed this theory. Really touching. ~ a 10 year-old
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very good app, it is outstanding!! I like the way it beeps to let you know the battery is low. I can't believe it it free,
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love how things are discovered as the trial progresses.  Jake was the attorney we had met in Time to Kill!  The fact that everyone won in the end was a good resolution!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Janelle's best project yet! It's very few albums I can listen to start to finish and not want to skip any tracks. Love it, love it!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Dramatized account of Beatrix Potters life. Well acted good storyline . She was a womman before her time, a true feminist, and conservationist.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is what the original films should have been. Sadly, this movie did not gross more and therefore will probably not have a sequel.
1250030951|3.0|Recently discovered this author, and I'm glad I read this book (of her three other books) first, because had I not, I probably would have never gotten to this one. This book, however, was a real treat. As someone who remembers, and was very involved in, the heyday of the Harry Potter fandom, I was certainly amused by the Simon Snow plot and the parallels it took to HP. I, too, dabbled in some fanfiction way back when, and I could remember the thrill of people truly loving your take on events--that feeling. I could appreciate Cath's love of writing fanfic--and even enjoying it more than original writing. That was an issue I dealt with back when I was college aged. It was interesting to see someone incorporate fandom into their writing the way Rowell did. Definitely the first time I've seen it, and without delving into details of it all, very accurate.<br /><br />Cath's real life journey was also compelling in a totally normal, very average way--which I enjoy. Just off to college, dealing with roommates, her sister, boys; I can appreciate someone making me want to read about someone's average sequence of events. Cath's life seems like a life I could have lived; I felt like I was on that campus at times.<br /><br />As for the love story. While this is not a direct knock on this book, I've noticed that Rowell's protags (Cath, Lincoln, and Eleanor) are practically the same person when it comes to love. The all are socially awkward and inexperienced at love; they all beat themselves up over pretty much any mudane interaction or thought they have of their specific love interest; they all fall in love incredibly hard and incredibly fast; they all talk themselves out of wanting to be with their love interest because they feel they're not good enough, ad nauseum; and then because their love interests are some kind of rom com definition of a perfect person, the protag is always coaxed back because their love interest refuses to give up on them.<br /><br />I love a good love story--the more real feeling, the better. While I was entirely over this formula by her third book, I read this one first, so I found Cath and Levi rather sweet.<br /><br />All in all, a good, breezy read if you're looking for something light and fun.
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|I loved it when Turbo saw the cars turning into tomatoes in slo-mo and a lawn mower with a spinning blade behind him.  Sam, age 7
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book from start to the unexpected finish. This book is well written, with drama, mystery, and touches of humor. It really makes you stop and think about what you would do in a similar situation.
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|This was such a disappointment for many reasons.<br /><br />The DVD is nothing but still photos with only two actual videos. {I think this is true since I did not make it past 3 songs on the DVD}<br /><br />The remixes on CD 3 & 4 are so far off target to the originals that it's actually a gross misrepresentation of how THE BAND ever sounded.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|this cd is well recorded and the performance is first rate  This is a pleasure to play at anytime, well worth it..
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I've much enjoyed this deep introspection on the subject of marriage, what it means to us, how it unfolds, how it is managed. All presented in the sincere and wonderful style of Elizabeth Gilbert, so honestly.  A book to be shared with friends, daugthers, nieces, and our own motherz
B0002VKZL6|5.0|This particular recording was done using analog recording devices, making for a sonic treat for the  ears, this ia a sure bet for everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|5 STARS for the potential and price point of this device. 1 STAR for its buggy performance and non-intuitive feel.<br /><br />I thought I had a multimedia powerhouse on my hands pairing this with the HP Chromebook 14. Chromecast tab casting is not worth your time and aggrivation, however a software update is supposedly in the works to alleviate this.<br /><br />My honest opinion? Spend an extra few bucks and spring for a FAR SUPERIOR Roku unit of your choosing.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Here are two great musicians playing wonderful music, making for a rare and unique musical listening experience for all who have this cd.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Classic Hitchcock, Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint were great for the roles the black and white of the film adds a lot to the period experience
B00GIXWXEO|2.0|Eh! Turbo was just okay…. It had potential but just never delivered. For a 5 year old maybe but more & more adults are watching animation films and the film must be able to woo the adults also. I know it's just a cartoon but it wasn't put together well. You never get into the movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great weather app ! Very accurate information about the weather and the special watches and warnings are fantastic. I love this app and have it both on my phone and kindle fire hd.
B004132HZS|5.0|Excellent show! A new take on an old classic that's skillfully done. Cumberbatch is the only one who could have made Asberger's into an entertaining job.<br /><br />This Sherlock is completely unaware, or simply doesn't care how his insights come off to others. He's only fixated on the truth, and will stop at nothing to get at it, often running over the lives and feelings of others (mainly Watson). But even so, he's endearing in a strange way.<br /><br />The episodes, while almost an hour and a half, fly by. At the end of the season, I was praying for more. *Note: you have to watch in order or you'll be lost.

B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Cool setup. Nice game but easy, good for beginners.  For kids it's perfect. For more experienced people it's a bit too easy.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin is a true inspiration!  This movie shows the obstacles that this young lady had to overcome and the wonderful job she did in making her way through it all.  We can all learn something from her.
B005KMX866|5.0|I would recommend this CD to anyone. Well done. I loved a loved all the songs and Chris Isaak and his group are great. I saw Beyond the Sun on PBS and have the DVD also.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|First time my twins, age 14 had seen it. I even enjoyed seeing it again. great movie….still. I bought it because they were playing a piece for a band performance.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|the game is ok but it is similar to subway surfers and temple run. this game is like a mix of the two but for younger kids.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You need to purchase the book your library is not complete until you read all three books each one gets better. Enjoy!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is one of the best games I ever played.It is a very fun u should download this game.Also follow me on instagram my name is rebel_matt_2003
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a fun game I played it on my friend kindle but it is taking me a long time to download and it takes me alot of tries
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages.  The pace is much faster than games of its kind, you don't have ya wait very long between quests.  A great time killer
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's an awesome game! But I have some difficulty because I cannot purchase gems because I do not have a credit card or money to do it. That gets me stuck in some quests until there's an update, which brings new quests. And the old quests are still there. Also, I don't know many people with the game. I mean come on ! Anybody who has the game must have pass the get all three of the cutie mark crusatiors. All I'm saying is that there should be more free gems or that the players could trade bits for gems!!! I'm just giving my idea. But after that little problem... I'M ADDICTED TO THIS! I LOVE IT!!! Anyone who doesn't have it, should just downloaded. But parents, be careful with your kids when they are using game. Be sure they don't hit the wrong button and spend to much money in a FREE game.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I find this very relaxing the only thing I don't like is that sometimes it doesn't select the puzzle piece I touch but I can live with that also I don't know if it's my kindle or the app but sometimes it stops. I like the puzzle picture selections and the music is relaxing haha
B00594XOZU|1.0|I am very upset with kik it hasn't been working for me for a while I can't even log in and all it says it unavailable this really sucks and makes me mad
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is great if you don't know much about what to use for each animal. Very addictive. I would recommend for anybody looking for a free fun game.
B0052ZQMLO|5.0|A very useful purchase for everyone who owns a Kindle E-reader and needs a proper German - English dictionary that is also well-priced;<br />I was unsatisfied with the built-in German dictionary  - Duden, which only offers descriptions in the German language and not English translations, plus it is also not very helpful with offering an instant 'snippet translation' at the bottom of the screen since its entries are too elaborate in terms of length -  thus I have chosen to buy this Collins dictionary and use it instead. It works flawlessly on my Kindle (you only have to change the default dictionary of the device once) and it offers adequate English translations of the words, most of which can be found instantly in the 'snippet' at the bottom of the screen once you put your cursor in front of a word. Its word-recognition rate is also pretty high, although not perfect, but that is something inevitable with the German language that has many words that are combinations of others. A reccomended pruchase for those who like to read books in German.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|Cannot compare with the original game I had installed on an older computer.  Color is faded and image is not very clear.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I LOVE IT. THE STORY LINE WAS AMAZING. I WOULD LIKE A SEQUEL TO IT. I WOULD BUY IT AS SOON AS IT COMES OUT.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Was a great little game for filling time when I had time to sit still but then I made the mistake of allowing the update and now it gets stuck after loading the introduction. I've even deleted the game and re installed it several times and it still gets hung up. VERY frustrating!
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Different for me so it was fun to figure out. Don't know how long it will hold my interest. Probably too easy for a lot of game players.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A beauty made of words I love how the author could make me feel a mix of emotion and draw suspense in at the same time I read this book for school and believe it is one of my favorite books its captivating and I could not put my kindle down and had to take breaks from the compelling emotion the author threw right at you amazing i loved this book it is great for any kid my age or a little younger or also if your plenty older loved it
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|So far I really like how it speeds up my samsung tablet. I'm clueless on most of this stuff so it gets the 4 starts for being easy for me to use.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Great game. I love having  a quick game that is easy enough for my little boy but cool enough for me to challenge him.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Beautiful story of the devotion of a dog to his master.  Don't forget your box of tissues!  Hachi is a true story you'll never forget.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun but being limited on how many tries per stage is very frustrating.  After five tries you will be put on a hold status for as long as 30 minutes until your lives are restored.  FRUSTRATING.  So much so that I removed it from my device.
1595827684|5.0|I love video game concept art books, and this one is one of the best. The book organizes concept art by character, location, ships, and weapons for each game. Some of the earlier concepts are quite different from the final designs. The book also includes many high-resolution pictures of some of the squad mates, which look absolutely amazing. The notes from the design team are short but informative, basics about where the design was going and why a design was chosen. I was actually surprised how often gameplay mechanics forced the design choice (often so players could distinguish between types of enemies). Overall, this is definitely a must-have for fans of the Mass Effect trilogy. (Nintendo, take note - this is how you make an &#34;art of...&#34; book).
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The Emperor's Soul is a very emotionally gripping story about a young thief who has the power to see and maniuplate the soul of living and inanimate object. She can feel the history of everything around her, and she reach back and forge their shaping event in new light.<br /><br />The story starts with our main character in a prison cell. She has recently been caught trying to steal one of the national artifacts of a civilization that finds what she can do to be contemptible heresy at best. However, they are in need of her skills after an assassination attempt on their Emperor.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul manages to bring the main character's struggle between excellence and self-preservation to life. Her story is gripping and tense. The magic system is unique and interesting, completely unlike anything I'd ever heard of. The supporting characters are a little archetypal, but sparks of their own personalities.<br /><br />This was the first novella I've ever read, and frankly I felt like it was a little too short. This is my personal bias. I love long, epic tales that span over several books. However, the story came to a nice conclusion, but I can't help but long for more information about this world and the character's that were introduced.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Once again this author has outdone himself.  The plot is great and as usual Jack Reacher  outdoes himself being the hero.
0547884591|3.0|I bought this book mainly because the author claimed it would revolutionize my ability to learn.<br /><br />However, only the first section of three (and the shortest of all) was about the learning process. It was a summary of things that can easily be found in the internet. He repeats some of the famous, but somewhat suspect, claims like the 80/20 rule and how you can gain &#34;fluency&#34; in a language in 3 months by learning a very small subset of the most common words. The idea of breaking skills down at the beginning and focusing on them singularly and intensely in a piecewise manner was very interesting however.<br /><br />The second section applies his method to cooking. It is interesting, and it provides a very succinct type of cookbook style that would be very handy with more recipes. However I found it also to be somewhat of a surface treatment. The perfect example of what I mean is the treatment on knife skills. I think three different techniques were discussed, but the entire discussion was maybe a page or two. That is not nearly enough space to teach someone proper knife handling skills to julienne, dice, chop, and cube.<br /><br />The third section was the application of the method to hunting, gutting, and outdoorsman type activities. Frankly, I wasn't interested in this section and I skipped it.<br /><br />Overall I think the book was just okay. It was a surface treatment of how to become okay at things quickly. I think this is the perfect book for people who like to be &#34;advanced beginners.&#34; The book didn't change my life, or my approach to learning at all. It was interesting, but not life changing as a the author likes to claim.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on kindle. Love it!  Love the game now I can play on bigger screen anywhere!!!  Now get pet rescue!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Story of Lincoln's ability to user his ambition, opportunity and need to change his style of operating to achieve greatness under very trying circumstances.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|My wife bought these for me after our first baby was born so when I play COD I can still have great sound but not to wake the baby. I treated these things well. Never mistreated them. When I wanted to use them I would carefully unwind them and when I was done would carefully wrap up the cord and put them away. Locked them away from my kids, never threw them on the ground (can't say the same for some controllers though) and after 2 years of use, one ear bud stopped working. I don't get it. One day it worked, next day it didn't. Pretty disappointing considering my care with them and the price they cost. Seem's like all electronics last a year or two then you spend another $100 dollars to replace. Skeptical about buying another set. Just disappointed...
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a very good mouse. It is priced much lower than the other leading brands. I would definitely recommend.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I HAVE ORDERED, E 2 twice, the 1st time I accidentally or the Kimball version. Then on Facebook through Louise Hays I ordered the Book, and Amazon seemed to automatically change it to Kimball version. I do not own a Kimball.<br />In the past years I have had excellent service from you until now.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Your thoughts affect what you perceive to be the material 'reality' of the external world. Wolfgang Pauli, one of the 20th Century's most eminent physicists, coined this 'the psycho-physical problem.' He spent twenty years in correspondance with Carl Jung, discussing this issue and even encouraged Jung to write about it in his book, Synchronicity, decades after Jung suspected that such a thing existed. Pam's book, whilst on the surface coming across as a light, superficial read, actually touches upon all the core concepts embedded in the heady world of science (non-locality, wave/particle dualism, qantum entanglement), that unintentionally give weight to this incredible idea that the consciousness of human beings has a quite unbelievable and personal relationship with the 'external' world. The popularity of this book and predecessors such as The Secret and The Celestine Prophecy (what? I hear you say - yes I'll get to that) reveal that there's probably a large mass of people out there who already suspect that something's not quite right. The world, the rational Newtonian, clockwork world, that we are conditioned to be a cog in, may not actually be the world we live in at all. That large mass of people have purchased these books seeking answers, but they may also be embarrassed about talking about this for fear of ridicule. Afterall, surely this is not how the world really works? I suspect that this large mass of people may soon reach a critical mass and that's when the paradigm shift can take place. So Pam is giving these people a simple gift - keep believing. Yes, that incredible coincidence that you experienced wasn't 'just' a coincidence - a random event based on statistical chance. That coincidence happened because of your thoughts. And that's why I mentioned The Celestine Prophecy as a predecessor, as James Redfield many years ago crafted a novel in which many of these ideas that Pam is touching upon, were woven into the fabric of that book - and it started with the perception of coincidences, of synchronicity, and their personal meaningfulness to the observer. For the past seven years I've been 'stuck' myself, as Pam so eloquently put it. I discovered, quite by accident, this incredible world and it turned my perception of my life and  relationship with the external 'reality' that I observe on a daily basis completely on its head. I didn't really know what to 'do' with the knowledge, that's if there was anything to 'do' with it. So, I sat in silence, burying my head in philosphy books and finding the occasional writer, such as Schopenhauer, who may have discovered this previously. I started writing my own book, eventually finishing 'Flight of the Tropicbird', which details my own adventures around the world and into Wonderland. But Pam has kicked me out of my slumber. Those questions I had about what the heck can I do with this knowledge are coming into focus, so I have to thank her for that. So if you think you're in the same position as me, then purchase Pam's book. It will reaffirm what you already know, give you some skills to start putting it into action and make you research other 'to do' manuals to start getting your life on the course you've always wanted it to be on. I know lots of people have shared the outcomes of their experiments, so I'll share the first experiment - the blessing. I asked the Field of Potential, this field of infinite potential, to reveal itself within 48 hours, to show me something that couldn't be written off as a coincidence. As I drove to work the next day in the left-hand lane of a three-laned section of road, a small SUV in the adjacent lane caught my eye. I could see something on the back of the car, but it was too far away. Then suddenly the car swerved into my lane for no reason and slowed down. I came closer to the back of the car. On the right-hand side was a bumper sticker that said simply 'Infinite Possibilities'. On the left-hand side was a bumper sticker that said 'Infinite Power'. The car then swerved back into the middle lane and accelerated off. That was the blessing. That was the message.wer'. The car then swerved back into the middle lane and accelerated off. That was the blessing. That was the message.

B00ECU34ZM|2.0|It was a bit predictable.  Certain parts of the story line were difficult to follow or just didn't make sense.  Tom Cruise's character was just sickeningly typical for the types of characters that Tom Cruise plays.  Tom Cruise needs to broaden his appeal by being cast against type sometime.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|not his best but after the last cd eminem is going back in the right direction,there are a few great songs that make eminem shine
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just amazing. We were a little upset by the quality at first, but after upgrading our wireless router (to an Apple Airport Extreme) we're loving it, and the quality is now perfect. We have two Roku's and now this, and we'll probably be getting a few more Chromecast's. If you stream everything (we don't have cable tv) this will round out your streaming capabilities. Sure, it isn't compatible with very many apps, YET, casting from chrome makes up for all of that.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Well, I loved The Shining, so I suppose I would love this one, too.  I didn't want it to end.  Not often I find a book that I can't put down.<br />This is the old Stephen King.

1410454606|5.0|Quick turn around and smooth transaction. I think this book will make a great gift for a wonderful father who is an avid reader but now requires large print books
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|This book is a fast-paced mystery action story which is packed with excitement and a murder mystery which keeps the reader gripped from beginning to end.<br /><br />There is something in this tale for everyone, from teenagers trying to help solve the mystery, to the murder itself and to a couple exploring the problems which exist within their marriage. It even manages to bring in terrorism and contagious diseases.<br /><br />This really reminded me of a good Saturday evening thriller on the television and would make a great holiday read.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love, love, loved these books. I really did. I couldn't, however give it 5 stars, because the ending. Seriously? This is a YA novel. A genre that I don't always read, but can generally be relied upon to give me that happily ever after. I finished this earlier today and have been ticked off ever since. Life is hard enough, you've got to leave us with a little hope!

B001NLCBJI|5.0|This movie grabs at something fundamental about life. The feeling we all have at some point of being lost, of not knowing where we're going, or why we're going there.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I have not had the pleasure of walking into a music shop and buying a Stryper album in a very long time. At age 34, It was such an awesome feeling to do that again.<br />What came next, I couldnt believe. This band came back with a fire lit in them! I was so happy that I was nearly crying. This is their finest album to date.<br />The powerful riffs, amazing vocals, searing guitar solos, thundering drums and bass have all returned. The production is top notch.<br />This is the album that I have waited a few decades for! Thank you, Stryper, for coming back and delivering what nobody could have ever imagined.<br />Side note to bass players: Pick up the Tim Gaines signature bass from Overture Guitars. It is awesome! I spent a few days with Tim while working the Overure booth at the NAMM shows and got to play his basses. They play amazing and by the sound of this album, record amazing.

B0016K40KO|5.0|A great movie about human suffering during a war. It describes the tragedy on both sides of the war and how pride can make a person blind. The acting is very good. It is the kind of movie that can be seen several times and you'll find a new detail previously missed.

B009NH6JRE|5.0|Awesome show! One of the best TV series ever! If you don't already own season one and two, get em.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had never read a Stephen King book before, but this was excellent.  The interesting thing about the book is to realize how each thing you do can have a trickle down affect on many other things.  It was interesting to read about Lee Harvey Oswald.  During this 50th anniversary year it would be a good book to read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book kept me captivated, I couldn't put it down. The story line was an intriguing mixture of lives and events artfully intertwined. The end left me thoughtful and introspective.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|This wonderfully researched, well-written narrative is an excellent primer for anyone seeking a general understanding of the Second World War, from the individual experience to the sweep of historical events.
B009ZM74F8|5.0|This movie was amazing! I loved the concept of the militant dystopia mixing guns and martial arts. It's good to see pre-Batman Christian Bale being awesome.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I have always read and enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series but, I had such a hard time getting into Dust.  I wanted to love it, but the inner working of Kay's mind are not that interesting.  I know I  am suppose to feel for Kay and understand the meanderings of her mind, but I find myself with more feelings for Marino and his insecurities.  About halfway through Dust the pace picked up and the story became more about forensics and less about feelings and i began to really enjoy it, but then the ending began to feel rushed.  I guess i really wanted Ganby to pose a larger threat, to not cave so easily (even though he was thoroughly caught).  I will definitely read the next in the series, but I sincerely hope Cornwell hears her readers.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|cant find many uses for it.I need more apps to be able to cast. Not a bad price but we need to tweak it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited for this game on my Kindle, I play it alot. Can be frustrating  trying to get thru levels but  so addicting,I love it:))
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Boyko Ovcharov recommended the book, Galactic Energies. As Boyko said, I also didn’t expected anything of the kind, the book was telling me. I was intrigued and curious of the plots of the short stories and couldn’t stop reading it until finish. Each episode, each short story told me something else.<br />Luca Rossi is really a great story teller in the sic-fiction gene. It was a great read.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I seriously love this little guy. Hopefully I'll have some photos up to demonstrate how small it is, but this amp is tiny and classy-looking and very portable. The sound is fantastic. Since this is the first headphone amp I've owned, the only context I have is how crappy my earphones sounded before them. I had made a desperation purchase of Skullcandy Ink'd because my previous earphones had broken. Now the Ink'd sounded okay. Probably wouldn't have thrilled anyone who loves music. However, the addition of the E6 made them a joy to listen to, beside that awful thunder-y sound when the cord moved around. That's a different review, though. Let's get back to the E6. The three EQ settings are very well-chosen by the FiiO people. I listen to a variety of genres and have used all the EQ settings. In my experience, the bass was improved tenfold in detail and the mids sounded a lot more crisp with this added to the set-up. The volume can get LOUD without the sound losing quality. Overall I'm very happy I made this purchase.
0316055433|2.0|Reading the Goldfinch was like being forced to watch a violent, unpleasant movie by Quentin Tarrentino that featured the pain and experiences of hard core drug users. The book could have had 200 pages edited out to get to the point, Art provides what life does not.<br />  Unlike her protagonist, Theo, who may not have been very creative, human beings may change their lives by making other choices which satisfy them better or give them alternatives.  Tartt makes excuses for people who are drug and alcohol abusers to just accept their fate of who they are and go with using the drugs and alcohol until their predictable ends. After all she claims, we want what we want even if it will kill us.<br />  Her name dropping of swanky fashion houses and other \\"high-toned\\" people, businesses and places is her continued ladder to higher climbing away from her beginnings in Missisippi.<br />  How did she get such a clear insight into drug use?  Did she have a habit of her own which gave her insight?

B007KL8Z40|5.0|I wouldn't have thought that I would like this sort of &#34;popular&#34; album, but I'm very fond of it. Great lyrics, Ana Brun's sultry voice, and some very dynamic arrangements, especially with the heavy rhythm on an assortment of drums: what's not to like? I recommend it.

B0000046MM|5.0|There can be no doubt that Paco De Lucia ranks among the world's finest flamenco guitarists. Unlike some of his later recordings, which no doubt present a more pure form of flamenco, I find this one more accessible and enjoyable. The title song ranks as one of my favorite pieces in any genre. Don't fail to listen to his collaborations with John McLaughlin and Al di meola, but own this collection of Paco at his best.
B00433LYBY|4.0|the thing that got me most was her rock god it will also get other people in christianity<br />and realy it is spiraterly wrong rock man would of been fine but if you know who the true god is and you  some how let him know it is to him it is okay
B005JZBP8W|5.0|An all-time classic in Blu-ray, what's not to like!  I suspect today's youngsters would also find this movie highly entertaining.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Awesome job game seems to be well thought out and I'm addicted already. Can't wait to play on my time off.
B00164GDA0|5.0|Classic coming of age movie with excellent acting.  Serious story well laid out, no blood and gore but would be scary, even potentially traumatic for the very young, but I will find a casual way to show this movie to my grand daughter when she hits 10 or 11.
1250038820|5.0|It's a fabulous book full of interesting and fascinating people including my daughter. We love Brandon Stanton. Great book, thank you
B00280LYIC|5.0|At first, this book seemed like an odd book in my opinion. It definitely wouldn't have been my first pick. Although, I didn't have a choice because it is a module in 6th grade. Now that I have read the book I am more open with books like these because this book was great! Take a chance with this book! It is a part of a series and it will definitely hook you in!  Have fun reading!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Outstanding acting by Denzel  Washington and a great script. Denzel  Washington realistically portrayed a flawed character. It was a totally different role than what I was accustomed to seeing him portray.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Why? That's what this book leaves me with. It started slow. Got better and then ...... REALLY? I'm at a loss.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is my favorite author. I grew up part of my life in Mississippi and can relate to the settings and people in this newest novel. The legal aspect of the story gives me insight into a world I know little about and the characters and story are nicely developed. Loved this newest novel.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Sad commentary on US health care or lack of....  its certainly not a comedy.  The US prides itself on being best but it can certainly do a better job of providing health care for everyone.
B00GHJ77KO|2.0|When it has came down to what Lady Gaga has had in music, it has honestly been more of a lukewarm than a driven reception. I was definitely not thrilled with the material so far she has laid out for the Artpop record. Her collaboration with R. Kelly on Do What U Want was really a weak and not strong spot in her works. So is the lead single from the album Applause. It definitely was one song that felt like a boom at first with so many of Gag's little monsters, but instead made itself become a bust in voice. The song doesn't ignite in the way Love Game and Born This Way did. Overall, I really didn't feel Lady Gaga gave it her all enough to make even more applause than she already has in her music. Is it worth checking out and downloading? Maybe, if there was more applause to it.<br /><br />Song: D+
1439190275|5.0|Awesome way to start on the Atkins.  More research and flexibility from the old diet.  I loved that it was recommended that you read the whole book before you begin the diet.  You know what to expect that way.
B00AEBBA1I|4.0|Good movie. Like phantom of the opera has good songs and a good story line of love and violence.<br />Bloody but good if you can look past it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is fun and very exciting I am happy<br />I recommend this game to everyone who enjoyes candy games.<br />I love this game
B00628RVV0|5.0|It brought out every emotion in me. Although I figured what the ending would be, I continued to hope it wasn't so, but then again I thought, &#34;Isn't that what the father had been doing to other's children. Then again, is it revenge we really want?? The children here can teach the adults what really matters in life. Innocence is pure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend came over and she showed me minecraft and we played all day. I was in love with it! I later purchased it on my Kindle, and begged my parents to get it on the XBOX and computer!! BUY IT DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the Pendergast books. This one used cutting edge biology to posit a very possible &#34;what if&#34;. The writing is taut and the storyline and plot are interesting.  Pendergast as you've never seen him before.
0671646788|5.0|This is one of THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!  THE BOOK APPEARED TO BE BRAND NEW SO IT DEFINITELY IS A GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY!  I WILL READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!  LOVE IT!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I just love this whole series. Great story lines, characters, sexiness. It is very enjoyable and I always look forward to more.
0061438294|1.0|This book is about reading people, and has intro material with pictures and basic gestures.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Introduction to gestures.<br />Pictures of gestures &#60;-- Excellent<br />Copious amount of anecdotes<br />Clearly delineated<br />Excellent font<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Very little information<br />A lot of (useless) filler &#34;explaining&#34; why things are so important (example, chapter 2)<br />Written seminar style (it sounds like he is giving a seminar, as opposed to writing a book)<br />Advertises itself (example (page 18) &#34;Once i reveal the answer&#34;)<br /><br />---<br /><br />The back cover says he is the author off 23 books. That alone should have scared me off. It is hard to write a book full of information, and 23 would likely take a lifetime (for the average person). He also gives seminars, meaning he isn't really an author, but is good at conveying information (though not in book form).  Well, he could *also* be an author, but this book testifies otherwise.<br /><br />IMO, the books reads like a cheesy script delivered by a used car salesman, and i could sum up the entire book into two sentences:<br /><br />1. Be alert to people's body Language.<br />2. If you don't know what a gesture &#34;means&#34;, try it yourself.<br /><br />I am unhappy i bought this book. I am aghast at all the positive reviews here. Are people really so daft that they need this book to tell them that scratching your forehead means your apprehensive? I really don't understand.<br /><br />If you are unsure about this book, please, read some of it with the preview feature and see if you think it worth your time (and money).
0061341029|4.0|The Audio is ok, There is a lot of good pointers but the Narrators voice for this type of topic does not hold my attention. He has one tone throughout the whole cd.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|took a few listens, but it has grown on me, and EJ does not disappoint. Some echoes from the past, vintage EJ.
160459201X|3.0|a friend recommended the read. I only read the first couple of chapters. I would recommend this book for someone in a Physiology class.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The case is a little more rubbery than hard plastic as it looks in the picture but it is transparent. I bought it for an old iPhone 4 that my daughter is using because it provides a decent amount of drop protection. I wanted a clear case so I could print her favorite cartoon characters and put them on the back of the phone without having to buy cheaply made, expensive, pre-printed backs. The &#34;ring&#34; pattern is a little annoying because it overlays the photo but she doesn't seem to mind at all. I didn't use the screen protector.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE this addicting game!!! I had request on facebook so many times and also heard people talk about their Candy Crush so i acepted and just LOVE IT!! I'm so proud it's on the kindle now i can play it all the time on it! I rather play it on the kindle then the pc!<br />THANK-YOU KINDLE for letting us have Candy Crush Saga on the Kindle!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|An honest look inside today's minimum security prison.  Our society is definitely losing in the &#34;war on drugs&#34;.  Piper covers her experience of how she survived her stay with candid humor while being respectful of those who were there with her.  I am also a fan of the OITNB series. There are big differences between the book and the series; the series has been pumped up with lots of drama.  Both will have you laughing and crying.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great story about what happened to that little boy who lived at the haunted Overlook Hotel with his family.  His adventures and experiences as an adult keep you from putting the book down until the very last page.
B004LROUW2|4.0|Rereading this book now and finding it fascinating. It had mixed review in our reading group--and a lot of unanswered questions--so I've tackled it again, this time on my Kindle. Even in translation, his words sing.
B00338QENI|2.0|This turned out to be a disappointment to me!!  I thought this book would be so interesting.  Sadly, about midway through it became really boring.....to the point that I put it away and refuse to even bother to finish it!  Also, I just could not muster the massive amount of sympathy and feeling of injustice for the family that I felt the author was trying to conjure.
B003KRLKHC|5.0|At the first didn't like it but the farther it went the better I liked it.  Great message and a pleasant surprise
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Yes it is a soap opera but it is a beautiful period piece with great acting and the superb Maggie Smith delivers the best one liners on TV.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I love it when the old guys win.  Great action and adventure movie.  Love story thrown in as a bonus.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn never falls short of expectations.  His books are always action packed and relevant to current happenings.  He will be sorely missed.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Best album Shea's ever made ...keep them coming! Mostly dance songs and all really great. Great voice still and all good music.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had lost my cable for my Kindle. When I called to purchase a new cable, the lovely lady who helped me was courteous, efficient and said there was no charge. Very nice.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|If you are  patience it is the game for you and that is coming from 14 your old ya brad
B00C33M2EE|5.0|A real gem. Fresh sounding music to wake you up to what talent and great music can do for your day, Keep it up guys. The visuals are stunning also.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|I've used these for over a year and they work well but are eclipsed by newer sets that operate on the 5ghz frequency.  Here are a few key things to know:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great sound quality<br />- OPTICAL PASS THROUGH (important because some only have optical in which can be an issue)<br />- Built in headphone stand.  Personally I love this<br /><br />Cons:<br />- This is the big one...due to running only on 2.4ghz frequency you will most likely get a lot of cracks, pops, and cut outs.  It really depends on what your wireless traffic looks like at your house (or your close neighbors.)<br />- If you have more then one set of these (or any turtle beach on the 2.4ghz) they will not work well together
6305558175|5.0|I watched Sommersby on TV sometime ago and now I ordered it for my Nephew and his wife.  I'm very embarrassed to say that I never did figure out if Richard Gere was her husband or a stranger.  Did they just leave it up in the air or did I miss something?  I still just loved the movie and can watch it over and over again.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|beautiful, inspiring,music, professionally done. we have been listening to it since halloween.i only wish i could play as they do.
1476727651|4.0|Stirring writing as only King can do. The story is powerful, not particularly scary, but the characters are well-developed and the story is sufficiently entertaining. Was slow at times, but overall a solid piece from King.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very interesting book. Great topics for discussion for our book club. Easy to read and very fast. Good beach book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is an everymans Kim Stanley Robinson. Wool is a well written, engaging and smart story. Can't wait to read the next book!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have some cognitive issues due to me. I find this to be a good exercise four brain. Well worth the money.
1434102750|3.0|this book was OK. but I was dissopointed of it when it arived as a booklet. Yes it was clear and all but it was not what I expected. Really dissopointed.
B001AGHV78|5.0|I bought these for my husband's birthday. He and I love these. They fit well, but I did buy them a half size smaller because of the other reviews.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Actually this was a Christmas gift, so I don't have any personal knowledge of this book.  The receipient said it was a good book, so I guess that is all I can say.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|One start is too much for this disaster , Don't waste your money<br />The story line was so far off from the original and boring! Mr. S.is only Clark Kent once for about 30 seconders at the end. one line is all Mr. Kent got, save your time on this one not worth owning<br />MLB
B006YC74E8|2.0|I could never get the hang of using this photo editor for my smart phone.  Maybe it was just not user friendly enough or maybe I just didn't want to spend a lot of time trying to figure it out.
0307279189|5.0|Bought the book originally with the intent on learning a thing or two about running. Got that plus a great story that was well written. Bravo Christopher McDougall, cheers.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Not enough songs on this cd. I would definitely recommend this cd to Bruno Mars fans . Has some great songs on it.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great writing and  acting. Highly entertaining and worth the time to watch the 1st episode. After that you will be hooked.
B0026PW67W|5.0|Beautiful.  Just what I expected.  Total fun for fans of the series.  The price is good and we really love it all.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Sad yet very realistic with an unexpected ending.  a brave man with the courage to do the right thing.  as usual an excellent performance for Denzel.
B001NIC0A6|5.0|One of many of my favorite movies. If you like adventure, than this is for you. With an all star cast it is quite the fun movie!
B001OKGX92|4.0|the corner stone todays cop shows.  it captured my attention & Bullitt would hold up to 2013 action movies.  Steve McQueen was laid back, smooth & very sexy.  He would just rock now.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is a great movie every adult who grew up in the arcades of the 80's & 90's will love it as ore more than the children of today.  Lot's of great references to video games of  the past in the back ground.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I like this game. Very relaxing so far. The battle is a.little mundane, but I like the way you can interact with the combat. Why do they make us write 20 words?
B003L77G6A|5.0|favorite show ever!! Was a really good deal!! I'm happy I bought it! BUY IT NOW! You wont regret it..
B005LAIISA|5.0|I love this movie it's funny and it's a really nice family movie to watch. I have all the age movies and they are all the same each is funnier than the other it kinda goes in order on how funny it is
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is action packed and fast paced. It is a great book to read,  you can't put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Levels actually require thinking, becomes mildly addicting. Make sure to disable your credit card or you will be racking up the charges!!
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great series!  Glad they will have a Season 5.  The HD streaming from Amazon was just as good as from Netflix, price was right too.
B004JRVQX0|3.0|Works well for it's purpose. The only complaint is that the cap is so flimsy that it cracked when taking it off.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|As an avid hunter, this game is just fun. Great to have around. Also helps teach vital organ placement to younger hunters for correct shot placement.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|heard about this game from friends and quickly got it.  very fun game . had trouble getting the boosts to work but i, personally , didn't worry about it. one thing i didn't know their was a time limit on solving the candies. (meaning retrys)<br />fun game to play !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very fun addicting game and i suggest it to all people who like challenges. Thanks for letting me play :)
0385349947|5.0|This book is the change my life forever book for 2013. So much will fall into place when you understand why women find themselves in the position they do today. This will give you permission to step into who you really are.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app thinking it would not be fun but I was way wrong. If you don't already have it get it. If you like building or fighting or playing with your friends this is the app for You!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a match 3 game. I love that it is connected to fb.I love that I can also play it with no internet.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|From the start of the game it is relly good but playing wise I can't play because it crashes way to much
B005HI7NP0|5.0|Love it. Listen to it all the time. Beautiful voice. Lovely tunes. Love the Roots. First Betty Wright album I've purchased.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is an absolutely fascinating story. Only Stephen King could tell this story and make it seem completely plausible to the reader.
B0089LOG02|5.0|very moving story of two girls two decades apart. how they helped each other heal. i didnt want to put the book down
B006ZN7KMM|4.0|Buenos art&iacute;culos en general. Algunos muy buenos y otros sin mayor inter&eacute;s, pero la mayor&iacute;a los disfrute mucho! Muy interesante la visi&oacute;n de Vargas Llosa sobre el Rey, y me sorprendi&oacute; mucho el testimonio del primer profesional espa&ntilde;ol con s&iacute;ndrome de down: un golpe a los estigmas... solo ese art&iacute;culo vale la pena todo!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is easy to use, easy to read.  And on top of that, it's free!<br />I would recommend it to everyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not for the faint of heart!!! This is very ingenious and hours of fun!!! Will be buying the pro version!!!
1934429821|5.0|I prefer this smaller version to the larger version. It is much easier to handle, and the photos look better than the larger book. Highly recommend this version. It has everything the larger version has, just reduced in size.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have no read this book yet, as with many other Grisham books that I have.  Every time a new one comes out though, I have to have it for my collection.  I will get around to reading all of them one of these days.  I have read about 4 or 5 of Grisham books and have always been unable to put them down until finished.
B002KYGLVQ|5.0|Such a great movie! We had to rent it on November 5th.  =)  I love how impactful this movie is, and it paints a bleak picture of a future that may not be far off.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Awful - spend the extra money to buy a Roku. This device is for penny pinchers and does not work flawlessly and there is ZERO support.
B004LQJPEG|5.0|The French Connection #1 is oustanding,.  Very suspensful.  It keeps you on your toes. Worthwhile watching.  # 2 good but slow.
0743277708|5.0|Some people think that rabbits are vermin along with rats, etc., but they are a separate classification - they are lagomorphs.  Reading this book led me on to several other nonfiction books about the history, life and habits of rabbits.  This is a carefully written account from the perspective of a rabbit, of a group of rabbits who decide to venture out into the big, unfriendly world in search of a place they can call home and the poetic stories they tell in the winter evenings in their warrens.  A classic!  Never to be forgotten.
B009KCUX3S|4.0|GOOD BOOK - but KINDLE version is unreadable. Lots of font that can't be resized and so I have to get out my magnifying glass. Returned it. Giving 4 1/2 stars for the content but 1 for bad format on kindle. Pick your poison!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|it's denzel must I say more, he nailed his character and everything seemed so realistic.  This movie will not disappoint.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am a fan of the Walking Dead and every episode keeps me interested.  You can say that I am invested in the characters as well as the story.  There is always the threat of attack by zombies but the main arc of the story is how people would react in a situation as compelling as the apocalypse.  Of course, this is one man's viewpoint but nobody else has really addressed this issue.  I hope in every episode, the characters will find out how to solve the problems they face.  But, new problems seem to crop up, characters die, get sick, get killed, etc. to keep me tuned in. I, like a lot of folks, hope that this story goes on for a while longer as I enjoy it so much.
0143120530|4.0|This a fascinating story about a journalist that first covers the US Memory Championship, then decides to compete in it the following year. This was a very enjoyable read and covered a variety of topics:<br /><br />- The history of the art of memory, which was once considered in ancient times to be as important as logic and grammar -- until the printing press forced it to fade into obsolescence!<br />- The techniques of world-class memory champions<br />- The story of a man with severely impaired memory who can't remember anything that happened more than a few seconds ago.<br />- How the minds of so-called &#34;idiot savants&#34; work (including an interview with Rainman!)<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, but ironically, can't remember 99% of it! I read it because I'm interested in retaining more of what I read. Unfortunately, ancient and modern memory techniques allow you to memorize long lists of things, but can't do much to improve what scientists call &#34;working memory.&#34;<br /><br />I guess I'll just have to invest in some nootropics -- smart drugs!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|the best keyboard out there.  I could go on for a while but I dont really want to do that.  Stores all your language and usage from gmail and texts.  Paid version stores it to the cloud in case you lose your phone or get a new one.
B000FP2Z1C|5.0|One of my top ten albums of all time. Rise Against is the best. Tim's voice sounds great whether singing or screaming and you get a healthy dose of both on this album.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The author, Andy Weir, is obviously a real astronaut who was actually stranded on Mars. His compilation of log entries is the best \\"How to Survive on Mars\\" manual ever written (so far). It should be required reading for all astronauts and for anybody who wonders whether math, physics, chemistry, common sense, and a great sense of humor have any practical value. I hope that he gets stuck on another planet someday and writes about it. I will read any book he may write about anything because it will be funny.<br /><br />Right now is the perfect time to read \\"The Martian.\\" On November 18, 2013, a spacecraft named MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) began a 440-million-mile trip from Cape Canaveral to almost-Mars (if MAVEN lands on Mars, it will have gone too far). According to NASA, MAVEN is intended to closely orbit Mars for the purpose of collecting data about Martian atmosphere. I suspect that the real reason for the close orbit is to drop off supplies for stranded astronauts.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love and hate this game at the same time.  Keep the challenge going and make it easier at times.
B004626XJU|1.0|I got angry early on with the author when his main character said that he 'smiled' when he heard about the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11.  I can't believe someone would make it into a movie.  I won't waste my money on the movie, and I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money on the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fascinating - Showed it to my wife and lost my tablet for the next 2 hours - Excellent brain teaser
B004MPR80E|5.0|A fascinating journey through the discovery of the understanding of cancer. As a doctor I found this intellectually interesting and emotionally moving. Science woven beautifully amongst human stories.
B003O7I6L6|4.0|the bluray packaging is slightly warped on my copy, but that doesn't really affect the sheer awesomeness that is escape from new york.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|GREAT BOOK. Funny interesting and AWESOME. You should read. Try sample if you don't believe me. R.J PALACIO IS A GREAT author and I hope the IS a book 2.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good plots, lots of action, great personal interactions in the characters.  Makes us wonder how we would respond if ever in a similar situation.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Now this thing deserves 6 stars by me.  The 4000 graphics never broke a sweat for my HTPC.  It runs cool and cheap for XBMC and alike.  Gave it 8 gigs Hyper x 1333 and it rips it up!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I normally  hate match three games, because they're boring.  But Fruit Drops is similar to the very popular Candy game, in that it gets progressively more difficult and challenging.  It takes strategy as well as luck, and I'm completely addicted to it now.  I love it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is one of a kind.  Can't put the book down when I get it, and anxiously await the next.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|It was one of the best books I ever read. This is one of my most very favorite books :-)
0345803507|5.0|Excellent trilogy , books were new in condition. If you have read 50 shades of grey you must read the next two on the trilogy.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The graphics are better here than many apps that I've paid for. The game is fun and easy to learn while being challenging.  The temptation to buy better equipment and playing time with real money is strong, but you can play without it.
0345803493|5.0|Excellent trilogy , books were new in condition. If you have read 50 shades of grey you must read the next two on the trilogy.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|Bought this set last spring and have NEVER been able to get the last three movies in the set to play. They either don't go at all or just stop during the film and freeze up the machine. Of course by the time I got around to playing them and made it all the way to the end of the series, it was too late to return them all. Luckily I had the last three movies on regular DVD so I was able to keep continuity in viewing all the films in preparation for visiting the &#34;World of Harry Potter&#34; in London.
006202406X|5.0|I loved it.... Still, the few last chapter were sad , bittersweet and heartbreaking { the people who read the book Knows Why} But that's why I liked it so much.. it was different that all the other YA novels
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|This movie is a pure representation of how a person with no expectations from anyone, with little needs can live a happy life. I have no doubts about Tom Hanks acting ability so I would not talk about it here, he is great actor. On other hand I would like to give my tanks to the Director, writer ScreenPlay to make this movie happen and teach today's human less world what is important in life, which is &#34;just being human&#34;.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Life does not have happy endings. It is a series of constant choices. I did not hate the ending. The book actually gives the reader much to think and ponder.
B00000JGHS|5.0|different kind of movie and you can see Demi Moore in a different limelight. If you like her movies you will probably like this one.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|It is a fun movie with lots of good action and not a bad story line.  Cant go wrong with Chris and Natalie.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|If ii never seen the original movie maybe this movie would have gotten 3 stars,, as it is somewhat watchable with very good actors but it fails in the comparison to the original's crisp writing, directing and acting.  The problem is in the attempt to update the story line and themes that clearly fit in the 30s but didn't fit with ontemporary times.  These are all acomplished actresses.  They re women who are likeable and have done wonderful work in other films but this was just the wrong movie and the writing, because it is trying so hard to update the plot fails miserably, gives these actresses nothing to work with to give real performances.  The original is a movie I can watch over and over again.  This version I've watched twice, hoping I'd like it better because I really liike this cast.  They try hard but I won't watch it again.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I agree with another reviewer, Stephen Chbosky's film should have won several Oscars, from screenplay to directing to acting.  All three of the primary actors, Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson were at their best in this film.  Logan Lerman's Charlie is miraculous.  For such a young actor to understand the power of minimalism is astonishing.  I've watched the film several times, and I can't help noticing Lerman's actorly stillness.  He knows that less is more, and because he seemingly does nothing, he inadvertently steals every scene he's in.  It's a good stealing because Lerman is not out to steal, his attention exquisitely focused on the other actors.  Their scenes are a fine example of ensemble acting.  No one is out to hog a scene.  Ezra Miller is an astounding actor who completely embodies the role of Patrick.  He was born for this role. Emma Watson is so believable as an American senior in high school, her British accent left in England.  And Logan Lerman, he too was born for the role of Charlie.  His acting is all in the face, in the eyes, in the mouth.  He actually listens to his friends, he looks at them, offering them himself in acts of exquisite attention, so it is no wonder that he knows exactly what to give them on Christmas. He knows his friends.  Yes, the major theme to Chbosky's film is friendship, beautifully underscored in three powerful scenes, the Kissing scenes.  The first scene involves Sam and Charlie.  Sam has been sexually abused by men and boys.  Her first kiss stolen by her father's boss when she was a mere girl.  She wants something far more magical for her friend Charlie.  She tells Charlie that she wants his first kiss to come from someone who loves him.  She loves him, a love the Greeks would call Philia (friendly).  When she kisses Charlie, she is not aware yet that Charlie's love for her is of another kind, what the Greeks would describe as Eros (romantic).  Later in the film, Sam and Charlie kiss again on Sam's bed, but thistime both experience romantic love, Eros (erotic).  Then there is the kiss between Patrick and Charlie.<br />In this scene, Patrick is dejected, for he has been rejected by his male lover Brad.  He wonders if he will ever meet and love a good man, and just as he articulates this, he turns and there sitting next to him is a good person.  And he impulsively kisses Charlie.  He instantly realizes his mistake and says, \\"I'm sorry.\\"  But no problem.  Charlie accepts Patrick's display of love.  He has already been the recipient of love from both Patrick and his step-sister Sam.  It was Patrick who invited Charlie to sit with him at the football game.  It was Patrick and Sam who accepted Charlie on the dance floor, forming a circle while they danced.  It was Patrick and Sam who brought Charlie to his first party.  This brother and sister invited Charlie into life, urging him to \\"participate.\\"  Charlie, therefore, loves them unconditionally, a love the Greeks call Agape.  Agapetic loves does not judge, it accepts another with no strings attached.  Charlie loves Patrick, and his response to Patrick's apology is simply, \\"It's okay.\\"<br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a beautiful film, and it will survive.  A Wonderful Life was not honored when it first came out, but it is now watched by millions every Christmas.  And what are the perks of being a wallflower?  To love and to be loved.  Nothing can beat that!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you Mr. Chbosky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CDTSFF8|4.0|The series put me into an interesting mental space. Excellent actors and production. Loved it !<br />I highly recommend this project.
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|Between March 1962 and June 1965, The Beatles appeared on 53 radio shows for the British Broadcasting Corporation (the BBC, a.k.a. \\"The BEEB.\\") The numbers are staggering: 275 performances of 88 different songs, 36 which were never recorded on the group's EMI records. Unfortunately, the BEEB did not keep most of the tapes or transcription discs of the original broadcasts; the only reason that we have them today is because enterprising Beatle fans taped them off the air on home recorders. Bootleg albums of the BBC recordings began to appear in the late 1960s. In 1982, using tapes acquired from fans and bootleggers, the BBC put together a radio series, THE BEATLES AT THE BEEB (a.k.a. THE BEEB'S LOST BEATLES TAPES), which was syndicated worldwide to high ratings and critical acclaim. My first serious taste of the BBC recordings came in 1989, with a two-CD bootleg set on the Swingin' Pig label called FROM US TO YOU (\\"realized somewhere over the rainbow, all rights re-severed\\").<br /><br />Finally, in 1994, Capitol/EMI released the first official version of The Beatles' BBC sessions, [[ASIN:B000007MVD Live At The BBC]]. The two-CD set contained 56 songs, including 30 that were previously unreleased. It sold over five million copies worldwide, reaching Number One in the UK and Number Three in the U.S. Four additional BBC recordings appeared in 1995: three on the [[ASIN:B00000DER4 Baby It's You]] CD single, and a fourth recording on [[ASIN:B000002TYX Anthology 1]].  Oddly enough, despite the BBC collection's success, Capitol Records deleted it from the catalog in 1995; after much public demand, it was reissued in 2001.<br /><br />For The Beatles' 50th Anniversary, Universal Music/EMI/Capitol has assembled two collections of the band's BBC recordings: one a [[ASIN:B00F4BJ4M0 remastered version of the original 1994 album]], the other a brand-new collection called [[ASIN:B00F3VOL38 On Air - Live At The BBC Volume 2]]. I purchased the box set collection containing both titles.<br /><br />The remastered LIVE AT THE BBC has much better sound than its 1994 predecessor.  I listened to both versions back to back; the old version is more bass-heavy and muddy, while the vocals and instruments are crystal-clear on the new version.  The most dramatic improvement is on the Elvis cover, \\"I Forgot To Remember To Forget\\" on Disc 2; it sounded terrible on the original issue, but is terrific on the new version.  The remastering team has also tweaked the album in a few places: there are now two versions of the \\"From Us To You\\" theme, one an opening version with a BBC announcer exclaiming, \\"It's the Beatles!\\"; the closing version, added to the end of Disc 2, is the one without that spoken intro that appeared on the 1994 album, followed by another BBC announcer giving credit to BBC DJ Alan Freeman for producing the show.  Also, two new speech tracks were added: one called \\"What Is It, George?,\\" which features George Harrison introducing the next song, \\"Soldier Of Love\\"; on Disc 2, after \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" Brian Matthew's silly instruction to Ringo to \\"Have a Banana! Catch!\\" is replaced by Alan Freeman's (and Ringo's) proper introduction (titled \\"Ringo? Yep!\\") to \\"I Wanna Be Your Man.\\"  This change was done at Ringo's request, I'm sure. Another tweak, found thanks to an alert reviewer, is on \\"Things We Said Today.\\"  The 1994 version had the BBC's Brian Matthew introducing \\"Things\\" as a \\"film song\\"; that intro was removed from the 2013 version. According to the 1994 liner notes, Matthew's intro came from a BBC Transcription Service LP entitled TOP OF THE POPS, which was shipped to overseas radio stations; for the 2013 release, the remastering team obtained a \\"clean\\" copy of the song without the intro, from the original July 1964 TOP GEAR broadcast.<br /><br />For the record, \\"Things We Said Today\\" was not in the movie [[ASIN:B00J2PQZEY A Hard Day's Night]], but did appear on a trifecta of record releases in the UK: the B-side of the \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"single (Parlophone R 5160); on the non-soundtrack side of the [[ASIN:B0025KVLS8 A Hard Day's Night]] album (Parlophone PMC 1230 (mono) / PCS 3058 (stereo)); and the EP EXTRACTS FROM THE ALBUM \\"A HARD DAY'S NIGHT\\" (Parlophone GEP 8924).  In America, where \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" which WAS a film song, appeared on the B-side of the U.S. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" single (Capitol 5222), \\"Things We Said Today\\" was issued on the album [[ASIN:B00GJ7ROXY Something New]] (Capitol (S)T 2108).<br /><br />The CD booklet has revised liner notes and photographs, many of them in the original black-and-white instead of the fake sepia-toned versions from 1994.<br /><br />One correction to the liner notes: The Coasters' \\"Young Blood\\" was NOT recorded during The Beatles' Decca Records audition on January 1, 1962, as the 1994 liner notes claim; the flip side of that single, \\"Searchin',\\" was sung by Paul McCartney at that audition.  The 2013 liner notes correct that error.  \\"Searchin'\\" also appears on ANTHOLOGY 1.  \\"Young Blood\\" does have an ex-Beatles connection, however: George Harrison and Ringo Starr backed up Leon Russell on his version of that song, performed as a medley with The Rolling Stones' \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" at the Concert for Bangladesh on August 1, 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.<br /><br />ON AIR - VOL. 2 is even better.  In addition to alternate performances of songs from the first album, it has BBC versions of classics such as \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\\" \\"This Boy,\\" \\"She Loves You,\\" \\"I'll Get You,\\" and \\"And I Love Her,\\" as well as rarities such as \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" and \\"I'm Talking About You.\\"  The four 1995 bonus songs are here as well:  \\"Lend Me Your Comb\\" is from ANTHOLOGY 1; \\"Boys\\" and \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" are both from the BABY IT'S YOU CD single, while \\"Devil In Her Heart,\\" also from that single, is a different version.  There are also bonus interviews with each Beatle, recorded in 1965 and 1966, for the BEEB's \\"Pop Profiles\\" series; John and George are on Disc 1, Paul and Ringo are on Disc 2.<br /><br />There are still seven songs that are missing from this collection, according to Mark Lewisohn's excellent book, [[ASIN:0517581000 The Complete Beatles Chronicle]].  They are:<br /><br />1) \\"Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream?),\\" (from TEENAGER'S TURN - HERE WE GO, recorded 03/07/62, broadcast 03/08/62); [The Beatles' first BBC broadcast]<br /><br />2) \\"Besame Mucho,\\" (from TEENAGER'S TURN - HERE WE GO, recorded 06/11/62, broadcast 06/15/62);<br /><br />3) \\"A Picture Of You,\\" (from TEENAGER'S TURN - HERE WE GO, recorded 06/11/62, broadcast 06/15/62); (NOTE: These first three songs, along with several other BBC and Cavern Club live recordings, can be found on the 2013 Rock Melon Music \\"gray-market\\" double CD, [[ASIN:B00B08MIQU I SAW HER STANDING THERE]], although the sound quality is not very good.)<br /><br />4) \\"I Call Your Name,\\" (from SATURDAY CLUB, recorded 03/31/64, broadcast 04/04/64);<br /><br />5) \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" (two versions:  one from TOP GEAR, recorded 07/14/64, broadcast 07/16/64; the other from FROM US TO YOU, recorded 07/17/64, broadcast 08/03/64);<br /><br />6) \\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\\" (from FROM US TO YOU, recorded 07/17/64, broadcast 08/03/64); and<br /><br />7) \\"The Night Before\\" (from THE BEATLES INVITE YOU TO TAKE A TICKET TO RIDE, recorded 05/26/65, broadcast 06/07/65).  [The Beatles' last BBC broadcast]<br /><br />According to the LIVE AT THE BBC liner notes, no quality tape of the three 1962 broadcasts exists.  Perhaps legal reasons also got in the way, or maybe Apple didn't want to feature any tracks with Pete Best on drums.  Unless the other four songs also have missing tapes, they would make an excellent EP, or could be the cornerstone for a future third BBC volume.<br /><br />In conclusion, these two collections - either in this box set or individually  - contain some of the greatest music ever recorded.<br /><br />Hopefully, we'll get CD/DVD versions of the Hollywood Bowl and Shea Stadium concerts next.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think the games is amazing.I love it .the only thing I would do is have better controls.also it's kind of hard to tell the difference between my area and the ones I have to get
B008CPZNL6|5.0|LOVE this!  I was using flipboard on my phone only but I love reading it on the kindle. I like reading on the kindle better than on my phone.  The photos and full instructions are nice on kindle.
B00008WT5E|4.0|How come there is no mp3 dowmload of this album on Amazon but I-tunes has it? Is there a legal reason (rights) for this?
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I loved visiting Clanton, Mississippi, Jake Brigance and other characters from A Time to Kill. Took me me back to what I personally view as his best book ever. I enjoyed this book as I have all other books by John Grisham.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Awesome CD, I love Gaga and this album was so cute.<br />Totally 80's pop sound.<br />Shipped quickly and came in perfect shape!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is a Science-fiction classic and should be watched by everyone.  Parts of the film are not acceptable for young kids
B000ICZD5M|3.0|The only book that was a book turned into a real POS (basically an impossible book to turn into a movie - one of my all time favorites - that was screwed up more by was &#34;Ender's Game&#34;.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Kurt Sutter and the entire cast are amazing!  You will be glued from start to finish...the writing is THAT good!
B000Q76K24|5.0|What a great movie!  Many people will find too long and boring, due to the lack of special effects and a lot of gore. A very believable story that's subtle and and possibly one of the best fictional movies I've seen on the origin of the CIA and the ruthlessness of the Cold War.<br />They don't make many movies like this anymore.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Kay narrating her adventures is the way to go.  Dark, yet we know she'll prevail in the end - until the next challenge.  Patricia, I do miss the black comedy books you penned several years ago.  What's happening on the Isle of Dogs?
B001P7HUF0|5.0|Matt Damon and the other actors really brought this movie to a level, I think better than the book, which is rare after seeing so many books desecrated by Hollywood.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I read the reviews after I got this book and I was shocked how poor the reviews were. I was a little worried. I have to say this book wasn't what I expected but it still was a good read. This book had a few dull parts in it which I wasn't expecting since the other books were fast paced. Some parts were also a little confusing because it went back and forth between Tobias and Tris so sometimes I wasn't sure who was narrating. What I was really surprised at was the ending, I totally thought it would be different. Overall I think this book was good, I just thought it was going to be better.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm really going to miss Vincent Flynn. His death ended a great series of novels far better than most of the genre.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I loved the book, seriously. Very inspiring...the only reason I gave it 4* it's cause I feel it's too sort for a real book and lil pricy
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Great movie about an incredible lady and leader. Too bad there's no one near her skills and tenacity in American Politics.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|If your into bodybuilding, fitness modeling, or just lifting in general, this is a must see/own. Pretty cool to see the early years of this sport and the man who made it a household name and who dominated it for years. It is a little dated obviously but still very enjoyable.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|What a classic film that never loses it's appeal. I saw it in the theatre on Christmas day 1982 and will never forget it.<br />I never knew that it had such a hard battle to avoid an X with the ratings board to be released until I read about the same battle with the original release of &#34;Bad Lieutenant&#34; - with Harvey Keitel, not the awful remake made a few years ago - that appeared in 1993 and never received wide spread distribution of the complete release (a great but gritty film but distributed in a cut version that was medicre at best).
B00AHXIC50|5.0|what can i say Bruno mars is awesome! He has a laid back vibe with some very suggestive lyrics. luv luv luv!
1401917232|5.0|I love Gary Renard's trilogy.  Being introduced to Gary's books was just what I needed to elevate my understanding of ACIM. The line of thinking definitely goes against anything we have ever been taught.  I like that because not much has ever really made much sense to me before this.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played this game on Facebook and I'm glad to see it on the kindle Fire. I hope they get more Facebook games for the kindle Fire.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great game especially for being free. no forcing you to buy stuff to continue or other junk, just an awesome game.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|First 3 seasons are good. Started to like it less after all the changes and whatnot, but I still think the first 3 are worth it to anyone who enjoys this type of humor.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|excellent story and beautifully told.  Very easy to fall in love with the characters. This is a great book club read as it deals with some difficult questions regarding taking ones own life.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Super helpful free app for class books and manuals and allows me to bring all these things to all my classes in one small handy device instead of several books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best parts back button and the ability to go back to previous calculations. I like the big buttons as well. Thank you.
B000ZN802W|1.0|This movie is terrible. If you haven't seen it do not purchase it. I am sure the seller is fine, but this movie was a bomb.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great story. It is well developed. It continues seamlessly from THG. I am looking forward to reading Mockingjay.
0316152196|5.0|‘Powerful’ seems to be an inadequate word for this book. Michael Connelly’s stories are always complex studies of human nature.  This book is particularly stark; life and death in LA seems to be ominous and frightening.<br /><br />If no one has warned you before, it is very helpful to read the Bosch books in order.  Harry’s personal life changes over the course of these books. Connelly doesn’t spend time recounting how Harry got to the position he’s in; this book opens with Harry looking for his wife, Eleanor.<br /><br />The author tries to offer some explanations for riots and hostile interactions between the races in this polyglot city.  However, I came away with a feeling of hopelessness; the positions of the combatants are solidified and no one is really listening.<br /><br />The police hierarchy and the political spin-doctors do whatever keeps them in power; they pay lip-service to the ideas of honesty and justice.  Sadly, this seems to be a realistic view of life in today’s American cities.<br /><br />Between the gruesome close and the general timbre of this novel, this is not a cheery book.  After reading this, however, I felt that I had a better grasp of the issues that create and maintain the tensions between the races and police.  I also feel little hope for the future of large, multicultural cities.<br /><br />Harry Bosch Series<br /> 1. The Black Echo (1992)<br />2. The Black Ice (1993)<br />3. The Concrete Blonde (1994)<br />4. The Last Coyote (1995)<br />5. Trunk Music (1997)
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|Best superman movie in years! Stellar cast great script! If your a fan of the older ones you'll love this
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|My husband can shoot bubbles forever. I need something to hold my attention and make me think. This series of games is exactly what I want in a game. My mind races and this makes me focus.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Had my attention from the first chapter.  I couldn't wait to get to the end so that I could order the next book.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Had a hard time putting this down. Can't wait to download book 3 and find out what comes next for the Gladers!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|awesome movie, and should only EVER be watched in 3D.... EXPERIENCE IT!!! Giant robots fighting giant monsters, what isnt to like?
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Alphabet Aquarium is great, it has 4 fun educational games that include letters & animals, the curriculum was developed by a child development expert for maximum benefit. If you want your child to focus on just one thing at a time you can change the settings. The games are a lot of fun, colorful, and function perfectly as all other 22Learn apps. I can't say enough how much I love 22Learn, all of their apps are great including this one. If you have a child or know a child that you see regularly you should definitely pick up this app, A+.
0735619670|5.0|&#34;Code Complete&#34; is a treatise on best practices for programming, centering primarily around the task of software construction. It provides advice relevant to programmers right now, even though the book's latest edition was published in 2004. The long shelf-life of this book is a tribute to its relevance as it emphasizes code readability and &#34;coding for the maintenance programmer.&#34; The book also covers code tuning, testing, project scaling concerns, quality assurance, ideal programmer character traits, the list goes on. In many of Stack Overflow's top 10 books for programmers, &#34;Code Complete&#34; appears near the top and for good reason. This book is an essential read for any programmer. As a new programmer, I read this book over the course of my first year in my career as a programmer, and my employers saw the quality of my code improve dramatically.
B000VWGYHU|5.0|Love love love the album! I believe this is Eminem's best work yet! I have it in my car and on my Kindle.
B00GD9F59S|2.0|Not a horrible ending but wasn't my favorite. I feel a bit let down by this one. I think there might be a spin off since there were a few characters that didn't get the closure some of the others did. I dunno it just wasn't as good as the others in this series for me.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Cute story following a typical romance plot.  Steamy oove scenes without being explicit.  Overall, a cute love story to make you smile at the end.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've owned these since it came out and I've really enjoy them. This fits my collection perfectly. The DTS surround sound is probably the most awesome feature to the set. Sound effects are loud, crisp and dialogue is nice and consistent. Next would be the picture quality; it's really great and makes the movies that much more up to date. The packaging is nice and solid. The only negatives I would have to complain about is the few added voices to certain scenes. But other than that if you enjoy all 6 movies and want them in your collection this is the perfect match.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I loved this book.  I felt so sad reading it because I am so sad at Vince Flynn's passing knowing that I've lost two friends....Vince and Mitch Rapp.  May they both rest in peace
B00005OMTT|5.0|I looked everywhere for this but apparently nobody even knows who they are because it doesn't exist in any  music stores. Decided i would get it online and voila!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game it gives me something to do when just sitting but it can be very frustrating at time. Recommended by a lot of my friends.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This game is amazing. So amazing I was going to buy an android to play this game. Turns out I do not have to. Thank you amazon! Get this game!
B00E9A656K|5.0|This is a great game. I would've payed a few dollars for a game you can get so much out of. Great racing action, a must have
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I believe u guys should play this awesome game this is the world's best game ever and u guys should play this awesome game that is so much fun
B003O86FMW|3.0|Saw the first movie. Had to read this book before the next movie comes out. Not cheating just a heads up to wet the appetite.<br />I'm sure the movie is going to be better than the book.<br />And the book was great!!!
0061766089|5.0|I have great expectations for this book, I have a masterpiece in my hands<br />I've heard a lot of this book can help you grow in design, with powerful tools
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This here is one of the best hunter games available. I'm not just saying it to say it either. It's even better with the big screen then the smaller screen like on an iPhone 5 or 4...<br />People im a GIRL and really enjoy this game,but not as much as da woods:)))))))
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read, got if free for downloading the iPad reader. Reads very well and the talent there is great. Yeah.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|With all that most westerners suspect about life in North Korea, our musings are nowhere near as severe a the truth. The shortages of everything needed for a comfortable lifestyle are horrendous. Severe food shortages, caused in large by the government's draconian controls, have resulted in mass starvation and despair. I urge you to read this book and pass it on to your friends.<br />Elaine Whinston
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Out has the heart lungs and and Brain good if u r a hunter that can not hunt and very addicting
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Watched this on Prime.  Great Show...  I love the characters and crazy, creative problems they run into.  Streaming Prime works great through my TV to the attached BLU ray.  Either way, its easy and a great way to watch TV
B004HYDM0A|1.0|Dud movie on top of poor camera work. Not worth seeing. Adds are misleading about some kind of roller coaster ride. More like a walk in the mud...
B005K17RU0|5.0|I pop into this app to get a quick yet complete look at my local conditions. I get just the right amount of detail; not too much, not too little. Recommended app.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Something about this movie is very captivating! I watched it 3 times in 3 days! Not what you expect and probably need to watch it twice to see what makes sense - kind of like having to watch The 6th Sense twice.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very imaginative and well written. Although the premise is a little weak, humanity ended due to pollution, global warming and a host of fuzzy reasons, once belief is suspended, the story flows quite freely. The book is very well written, a pleasant surprise among Amazon's discounted offerings. I have read the first 2 books in the series, and am looking forward to the third, for which I will gladly pay full price. (I actually read the first two for free from the Kindle Lending Library).
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Very suspenseful and not what you might suspect.......Amazon requires too many words in this rating box! Forces us to write filler.., so, if you only see ONE movie this year......well you don't get out enough!
B0086449YA|5.0|Saw several of these cuts performed live in Seattle and immediately bought the album. Several months later I believe it has become my favorite of all the Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits albums.
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|I really liked the idea of getting a processor that has decent video built in to the chip. On my older computers the video card seemed to be the part that failed the most, so a chip that has it built in seems to be the way to go, and since I’m not a heavy-duty gamer the video performance is more than adequate.<br /><br />Did you know that the boxed version comes with a fan for the processor? I didn’t know it came with a fan and almost ordered a fan until I stumbled on a link somewhere that said the boxed version came with a CPU fan. The fan it comes with has the standard arm/clamp setup which is nice. It’s also quiet in my setup (I can’t hear it). A quiet (for me) fan that uses a standard connection setup was a real bonus!<br /><br />Any issues? Well, going the AMD site to get the latest drivers is terrible. Their auto-detect software doesn’t work. Also, they bundle all of the drivers (video, plus all of their other components) in one package - AMD Catalyst/AMD Vision, which seems nice, but I got one version that failed for my USB 3.0 driver (computer wouldn’t boot). When it wouldn’t boot it didn’t tell me which driver failed, so after a number of installs I figure out which drive to not install. Fortunately they let you install/not install each component driver individually, so I eventually got it to work.<br /><br />I like the processor – fast enough out of the box for me, though I guess since it’s the unlocked version I could tweak the speed even more, the graphics are fast enough for me and work for all of my stuff, the fan works fine for me. My only issue is with the AMD web site and one of their drivers was bad. The support is the only reason why I’m only giving this 4 stars.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|I saw Michael Kiwanuka on Austin City Limits on PBS a couple of weeks ago, and immediately went to Amazon.com to order his CD.  I love his voice and his songwriting skills.  I'm sure if he continues to stay true to himself, he will have a long career.  This album is so good it's hard to believe it's his first.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|What can I say about Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? I grew up loving this movie. It is such a magical ride! The first time a child sees those wings open on the car, or it turns into a float and has a race with a ship, they are hooked!
B004EF65QA|5.0|A most wonderful love story of all time...only wish there was a sequel !  Richard Armitage is awesome. and Daniella Denby-Ashe is stunning.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Growing up in a family that is very much in love with sci-fi, meant that Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Gallactica etc were a part of our lives. So despite the changes Lucas made to the movies, it is great to finally be able to watch all 6 movies in full, glorious, 1080p, with 7.1 surround sound!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Got addicted right way. Found myself not able to put game down. Kept saying one more level. Good way to kill time
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is addictive but we feel sorry for the scientists.  don't know how anyone can do 30,000kilometers, maybe it should have a way to turn off the aggression and Barry can see everything on a guided tour.

B00D954ACC|4.0|Clever period film. Not only done in the style of a 1950s Technicolor classic, but reproduced down to the smallest technical and artistic detail. The fifties-inspired animated intro sequence, the pastel palettes for costume and set design, and the editing utilizing the soft cutaway. Impressive. And yet, while Director R&eacute;gis Roinsard and company created what at first blush appears to be just another routine romantic-comedy - however gorgeous - appearances are only skin deep. This film offers a much more layered composition than a typical genre production.<br /><br />It is 1958 in France, thirteen years after liberation.<br /><br />We're introduced to simple beauty Ms. Rose Pamphyle. Living in a rural fishing village where her papa runs the local dry goods store, she dreams of becoming a city girl.<br /><br />And Rose has just discovered her ticket out: The typewriter.<br /><br />With no formal training, and using only two fingers, she pushes herself to become an incredible typist.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, her deeply traditional father is unimpressed that his little girl has taught herself what he considers a useless skill. Anything not improving herself to become a wife and mother is by definition 'useless' from his perspective. Her stated desire to become a working professional and her absolute refusal to follow tradition, frustrates and confounds him. Worse, having already arranged her marriage to the town's most eligible bachelor, it becomes a breaking point of contention between parent and child. They part on very bad terms.<br /><br />Despite that awful hurt, she follows her passion to the bright lights.<br /><br />Rose's first job prospect is an eye opening splash of cold water. She unhappily discovers that there are standards and expectations she never anticipated - her interview is cut short. Making a desperate last second grasp at her fading dream, picks up a form letter she discovered next to the office typewriter. With the speed of Mercury and the accuracy of a Terminator - blasts out a perfect copy.<br /><br />Monsieur Louis &Eacute;chard, who had just dismissed her as a potential candidate, is impressed. But can she actually do more than just type?<br /><br />Turns out - no.<br /><br />But Rose comes into his life at a strange confluence of personal reflection. Already insecure about his position in the family business and jealous of his expat American buddy, for reasons that go beyond their friendly wagers, decides to take the young woman on as a personal challenge. He's going to train her to become the world's fastest typist. A champion. And though her success he believes he will resolve and release the emotional baggage that he's carried since the end of the war. Concrete proof he was always the better man.<br /><br />To accomplish this goal: Louis insists that the strict training regimen he has planned requires Rose move in with him. Alone in the family estate far away in the country. She's understandably suspicious. But he makes it clear he wants only one thing from her - she will succeed where he failed.<br /><br />Soon, their personal frictions and constant elbow rubbings become something more.<br /><br />Not going to say that this was a cinematic masterpiece. It was however a very good film with unexpected depth injecting modern angst and storytelling into, what at first glance, seems like a run-of-the-mill romcom; quietly revealing itself to be a surprisingly complex character study.<br /><br />I'm torn between five and four stars. Everything in this production fits my definition of a near five-star film. But there was some unspoken disconnect, a creepy 'ick', that I couldn't get over when it came to co-star Romain Duris who played the male lead Louis &Eacute;chard.<br /><br />Call it a solid four.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- Despite being a common digital composite of real-life and CGI, I was truly impressed by the outdoor scene where Louis and Rose drive under the Eiffel Tower. The vintage cars, people walking the streets, the simple mid-20th century cityscape - everything was perfect. It was like being given a chance to pull back the curtain of time and see the world that once was. Fantastique.lking the streets, the simple mid-20th century cityscape - everything was perfect.

0345803485|1.0|this book stinks its trash its pure trash it is the worst book trilogy ever made this book stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i seriously hate this book trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|I love the comic-book style camera angles and cuts. RIPD offers action scenes, quirky humor, unique characters in Proctor and Roy, and even features a concertina.  Somehow, though, it doesn't quite come together... The comic book approach isn't consistent--the film tries to keep Ryan Reynolds' character as kind a a straight man/outsider, rather than letting him have the dark edge that the character clearly wants.  As is, movie could really use a subplot or two, and maybe more of a supporting cast to flesh it out. So, as an action romp with good jokes, it's solid.  As a new MIB or Watchmen, eh.  But, seriously--I'd watch it again for the concertina scene.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Kindle is very friendly, functional and useful.<br />The setting/preference click is sometimes quite difficult to work and I would like to see if it could offer the sorting of all my books in various orders (esp in sequence of dates the books were first published and also by author, etc.)<br /><br />It would also be better if all the books in the kindle shop has a brief summary of the book to make my choice easier.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Fun movie!  Good comedy.  We enjoyed it!!  Based on some of the reviews I didn't expect much but I am glad we watched it.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|This is a pathetic, childish Hollywood treatment of the Superman creation myth.<br /><br />It seems the director's basic reason for making this film was to blow stuff up using special effects. Set design was foul. The Krypton landscape and technology was ugly beyond belief. Incredibly poor direction and film cutting. Soundtrack was pretty bad as well.<br /><br />On the plus side, the actor who played Superman, did look like the comic book Superman. Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner were good in their roles.<br /><br />The Lois Lane actor was miscast in her in appearance. Her acting ability is questionable as well.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this stinker.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Ever. This book was amazing, even though it did start a bit slow. Great read; I highly recommend to all readers!!
B00124PXW8|1.0|This movie was really stupid. There may be such a thing as a demon taking over a body or soul etc, but this whole thing was kind of dumb and unrealistic.<br />The truth, a one can not be in my opinion induced to something that is really ugly but comes on as being beautiful and attainable and then later on shows true colors.<br />The movie in my opinion except for the ending, stunk!
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|Color, cinematography simply awesome! Not a gripping storyline, but powerful character development. Made for Anglophile viewing, I think. Storyline gets better and better as the movie progresses.

Now  it plays longer before it freezes.  My  son Loves  The Ninja.Turtles  so  he  continues  to play I  don't  think  it  was  worth  the $6 I paid.  Hope  they  work  out  all  the  bugs so  we  can  enjoy more  play.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Amazing writing, casting, direction, makeup, hair, it's all a part of this brilliant season of AHS. Not a fan of bloody horror, but the story is so riveting, you have to see what happens next.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It seemed rushed and not well thought out like the first two books. Choppy with the change of point of view.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I real enjoyed this second book in the series. It's a very captivating story told very well by Jeaniene frost. I thoroughly enjoy bones, who continues to remind me of Claus from vampire diaries, whom I love.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that I wish cat & bones &#34;marriage&#34; was more in depth and would have made a better ending than the current, but that's all personal preference really.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It's been years since I read this book and I'd almost forgotten how wonderful it is.  .  The daddy of all vampire stories.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an excellent book...a &#34;page turner&#34; as they say.  I'm not familiar with this author, but I would look into other books written about her.
1476727651|5.0|I have to admit, I was skeptical when I first heard Stephen King was planning a sequel to The Shining.  The original was published in 1977, when King was a much different writer than he is today.  The Shining is one of King's most celebrated novels, a book that has remained a favorite ever since its release.  King has rarely written sequels, having only done one for The Talisman with Peter Straub, unless you count the books in the Dark Tower series as sequels.  Any longtime fan would have doubts about the quality of any sequel to one of the early favorites, and I was too anxious over a possible letdown to get overly excited about this book.<br /><br />Thankfully, King has done a fine job crafting a suspenseful, bizarre tale that works well alongside its predecessor, and in no way tarnishes the original story.  The plot centers around a travelling band of vampiric, soul-devouring parasites who inhale \\"steam\\" from humans who have psychic powers.  The more they torture the victims, the stronger the steam they produce, and this freakish cult, called the True Knot, gain youth and vitality each time they take steam.  Also central to the plot is a young girl with extraordinary powers named Abra, a girl to whom the Knot is inevitably pulled.  However, a grown Dan Torrance, who knows a thing or two about special powers, finds himself pulled into this showdown between the innocent young Abra and the evil cult.<br /><br />I like how King starts the novel filling in the history of Danny Torrance after his experiences at the Overlook.  I enjoyed reading about his life, even though he unfortunately followed in his father's alcoholic footsteps.  I think Danny's struggles with the bottle give the book a gritty realism, showing that often not even family trauma can prevent us from repeating the mistakes of the past.  I also like the humble life he leads, not using his psychic abilities to hit the lottery or bet on horses, like Jack Sawyer in Black House (the sequel to The Talisman).  His life helping people in a hospice make the transition from life to death has a quiet nobility, offsetting the ugliness of his drinking lifestyle.  Even though he'd done some bad things, it was easy for me to like the grown-up Danny.<br /><br />The villains of the book are classic King monsters.  Weird, shape-shifting vampires who have one single elongated tooth like a tusk, who torture psychic children for as long as possible before the children die, and then inhale their essence...yeah, that sounds like old Stephen King.  While the True Knot do remind me of the Salem's Lot vampires crossed with various creatures from the Dark Tower books, they are undoubtedly memorable and some of the nastiest boogey-men King has dreamed up.<br /><br />The structure of Doctor Sleep will keep you reading, as it bounces back and forth from Danny, to Abra, to the Knot, pulling them gradually closer and closer together as the plot unfolds.  They seem to be completely disconnected at the beginning, but their relationships are more and more startlingly intertwined as the book progresses.  I love that Danny is eventually lured back to the site of the Overlook, bringing the sequel full-circle.<br /><br />I don't think Doctor Sleep will be remembered as one of King's all-time classics, as The Shining has been.  I think that if he had written it during the prime of his horror-driven early days, it might have had a chance of achieving that status, but the latter-day material of any legend like Stephen King will hardly ever earn the praise of their earliest work.  I prefer to judge this book on its own merits, and I think it has a fantastic plot, great characters, and a tone akin to the books from King's classic early 80's period.  Its chief concern is story, not religion, politics, or philosophy.  It's a campfire scary story that I think does a great job telling much more of Danny Torrance's history.His life helping people in a hospice make the transition from life to death has a quiet nobility, offsetting the ugliness of his drinking lifestyle.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|The Mack truck that is Breaking Bad rolls on in Season 3 with some of the most dramatic, shocking, thought-provoking, outrageous, enthralling, and addicting TV to ever hit the screen.  The story is brilliant, and the subplots so urgent and intricately interwoven into the central plot that no moment of the show seems unimportant or wasted.  That might seem like a strange statement given that this season has an entire episode dedicated to chasing a fly, but that’s a story unto itself.  As Walt and Jesse continue to get pulled deeper and deeper into the underworld of the big-money drug racket, and Hank draws closer and closer to the truth, the tension builds one episode after the next, keeping the series on a highwire that’s both dangerous and thrilling.  Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deliver such captivating performances that they both took home Emmy’s for their efforts, and Anna Gunn, R.J. Mitte, and Dean Norris aren’t far behind as Skylar, Walt, Jr. and Hank.  Breaking Bad does an amazing job of showing how bad decisions can lead to an unstoppable chain reaction of unexpected consequences, and as Walt’s personal life gradually comes apart, the lesson becomes apparent that when hurting others to help yourself, the end never justifies the means.
B001KEGRC0|5.0|Great photography. Excellent documentary. It really makes you think about our water situation and the problems that we are facing.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Love all the characters in Lost, and the ending is a tearjerker.  Just discovered Lost and loved the writing and characters.  just did  not want the series to end.
B005PK1G76|3.0|You get what you pay for here. I used it on my Britax stroller. It is cloth and hangs kind of awkwardly, but is functional. It is hard to fold the stroller up with it on. Luckily it is easy to remove.
B000062V9C|5.0|I love the movie but had to sent it back because it wouldn't play in my Region. Not clear what regions means.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|This book started of slow and with so many characters that it was hard to keep straight what was going on. It took a few chapters to get into but the strong personalities of each individual was intriguing and captured my attention. These characters aren't likable and the story is strange, but I am glad to have read it and it definitely took twists and turns I did not expect. Now that's I've finished it, I'm not sure what to think about the book. It was odd and peculiar and I'm still trying to decide if everyone but Ms. Dean was insane...
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I really like the game. It reminds me of battle beach a game I play all the time. this looks to be a competitor. for my time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't like the tracker jackers part and the mutts. I did love the cave and how Katniss decorated Rue with flowers when she died. I also thought that the book was full of action and so intense!!
B00EZPCZ5O|4.0|From their original punk basis, AFI has grown into a mature sounding goth rock band that people won't be afraid to admit they like. It's a refreshing change of scenery when a lyricist such as Davey Havok actually writes from the heart with passion and emotion. They are not writing songs to make money. They are not the reflection of Green Day. AFI has always stuck to their own motivation and &#34;Burials&#34; demonstrates a growth musically, lyrically, and thematically. Though the songs are about as happy as Robert Smith in a rain storm, they evoke thoughts and images akin to suffering, loss, anger, denial, guilt, and overall...pain. Perhaps AFI is telling us this is where life truly is...not in the heady, happy clouds but in the dark realities. Buried?
0143119680|1.0|I've been trying to read \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" -- it looked fun and had come highly recommended by someone I thought I trusted -- but here's a paraphrased, conglomerated conversation between the main character, Diana, and her love interest:    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   \\"Oh, Matthew de Clairmont! You must remember that I'm an independent and strong 35-year-old, tenured, Oxford professor! I don't need your help just because you are a thousand-year-old vampire who looks like a 30-something and smells of spices and has long elegant fingers and a chiseled jaw and broad shoulders and mesmerizing eyes and such masculine energy and impeccable taste in wine and cheese and mushrooms and ...... *swoons*....oh, all that MONEY!\\"    \\"I know, Diana, my love, my goddess. You are the strongest witch I've ever known! You row and run every day and your body is just...SCHUH-WING! You are so much stronger than I am! I tried so hard not to love you, but I am drawn to your power and your light! NO! Wait! I mustn't! I am so ....dangerous...so dark...! I can't bear the thought of accidentally attacking you.\\"    \\"Oh Matthew, you know I will love you no matter what. I know I can handle your wild beastliness!\\"    \\"No, Diana, I am telling you I could kill you if I lose control! I am so broooooody and daaaaaark!\\"    \\"Oh, you silly! I know you love me! We've known each other almost 3 weeks now and I just KNOW you could never, ever give me the hurtsies and booboos! And will you please show me how to use my magic that I have always known was there but just couldn't awaken without you? *simper*  NO! No, WAIT! I don't WANT to be a witch! I've always known I have such power and I'm the most special witch that ever was, but I'm just too afraid to use my vast powers! Magic has always led me to....to....PAIN...! *sobs*    \\"Enough! You are wearing yourself out! I ORDER you to go have a bath and eat something, Diana Bishop! You WILL NOT be allowed to get sick while you are under my...er....protection...! I will not have it!\\"    \\"Oh, Matthew de Clairmont! I simply cannot go shower and I know it's been days since I've had a bite but I don't think I can eat! I'm just so sad when I have to leave your side! I'm sure to flood the world with my magical tears! Yesterday, while you were gone I nearly flooded your mother's house with my enchanted waters!\\"    \\"You WHAT? Oh, how could I?! I left you here for a whole day without my guidance, and look what happened! What if you had DIED? Oh, I blame myself!\\" *sobs*    \\"Oh, Matthew, promise me you won't ever go anywhere again!\\"    \\"You know I can't promise, Diana. You know I must come and go on all this secret business I won't tell you about to PROTECT you!\\"    \\"I don't need your protection, Matthew! Remember, I am an independent and strong 35-year-old, tenured, Oxford professor with a fabulous body wrought by 16-hours of rowing and running every single day! And if you'll leave again, I just don't know what I'll do, except cry! And maybe snoop through your drawers.\\"     \\"Yes, you are so strong, my darling Diana. So independent! But, don't make me lose my temper with you. Now you GET! Go on, GET! To your room! AT ONCE! I will order a dinner tray brought to you!\\"     \\"Yes, Matthew!\\" *giggle* \\"I can tell you care about me because you are so moody and bossy! Just don't forget that I am an independent and strong 35-year-old, tenured, Oxford professor!\\"    \\"It gives me a boner. Oh, and by the way Diana, you and I were married two weeks ago.\\"    \\"Oh! We were MARRIED? Without my strong and independent permission?\\"    \\"Yes. I kissed you, and in the vampire world that means you're mine.\\"    \\"But, in the vampire world aren't the men in charge? Does this mean I have to let you lead and make all the decisions?\\"    \\"I'm afraid it does.\\"    \\"Oh, okay. Just remember that I'm strong and independent 35-year-old, tenured, Oxford professor, and I don't need you or anyone else to rescue me! Will you carry me upstairs for my nap and my half-bite of watercress sandwich? I'm feeling peaked.\\"    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    I don't know how much further I'm going to get, gag reflex being what it is and all. It feels like a repackaged Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey, with the same wet-noodle, codependent Muppet-Woman in the lead.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I chose this rating mainly because I like the angle from which this author chose to write this story. I've read many stories from that era, but none quite as unique and the way this one was presented. It was a hard to put down read once I started it, but it was also a hard to read because of the story matter, but it was presented in such a way as to see the story from a different viewpoint as how relations could be formed during one of the most stressful times in history. The characters came to life as I read, and made an impact on the heart, and loved each and everyone and it was sad when the story ended to let them go. Great book and would recommend to anyone.

B00DW1WR14|3.0|I'm a huge PJ dan and have been since VS. In my opinion this is their weakest album to date.  The first half of the album is memorable with rocking numbers like getaway and mind your manners and the ballad/ melodic sirens and infallible.  The end is very dissapointing though, not because the songs are bad but because they clearly lack the polish of the songs in the first half.<br /><br />Overall this album feels like more of the same when compared to backspacer and doesn't show the progressive sounds that are a PJ trademark.  Perhaps the saddest conclusion for me is that after listening to the past two albums I will wait before purchasing any more PJ albums, wheras I would preorder in the past. Perhaps it is just my changing tastes, but the band just doesn't seem to have the same gravitas as before.  Still worth a listen but think carefully before purchasing.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has been life altering for me.  For a different perspective from what we have been taught all of our lives about nutrition, finally something that makes some sense from an evolutionary point of view.
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  I only go to the theater about once a year, and I am very glad this is the movie we chose. I bought he DVD as a Christmas gift for my little brother and he loved it too.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Easy read and enjoyable, with some really nice life lessons mixed in!  Had humor and some very touching moments.  I would recommend it!!  Not going to make the top sellers lists, but worth reading!
B009V3KKXY|4.0|Really good book for after you have gotten the basics down, some of these are a little complicated but they turn out beautiful.  Great project to do with your kids, doesn't matter if they are girls or boys because they'd both got a kick out it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is the Best show on Cable Network at the moment. But make certain you watch from the beginning.. It's well worth the time to get to know these amazing character's.
B003B02O0A|4.0|I gave this book a 4 star rating because it was drug out to much. It was a good book but to long.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The story line and characters are all believable and well played out.  It's easy to relate to the characters.  Great cliff hangers at the end.
B000002G7G|5.0|It has all been said. Like it...don't like it. But you should hear all of the Velvet underground. Then you can tell when someone is ripping them off. And they do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  Fun to play.  Great for all ages.  Don't have the same bonuses as in the Facebook version.  I play on SG3 and kindle.
B000002G7E|5.0|Go see my review of The Velvet Under Ground CD. Same deal. If you read all these and you still have not bought it stop reading and find a copy at your local independant record store.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great new book from Grisham. I recommend reading his first book, Time to Kill, before reading this one. Different stories, but it sets the stage for Sycamore Row.
B004ZNB12O|3.0|Pink Floyd's music is excellent, and the compositions on this recording deserve an &#34;excellent&#34; rating.  However, the disc had a major flaw, which distorted the last three pieces.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Was getting ready to read Grisham's new book, Sycamore Row, and decided to reread Time to Kill in preparation since they are in the same setting with many of the same people. Both books were great, I recommend reading them back to back.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Great film for the family, my kids are 3 and 5, a couple of scary scenes but not too scary for either. Although my 3 year old tuned in and out as her attention span is not as great at her age.  They both want to watch again and again!
B00G8P2B4E|5.0|I watched this movie with my children and now with my grandchildren!! We all love the movie!! Thank you so much! Lisa
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is a great story teller.  The plot never becomes stagnant as the reader is lead through a maze of ever-developing situations with each character.  Keep it up.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson's work seemed to be honest and well written.  An interesting insight into a complicated person whom you will enjoy and dislike.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I recommend this trilogy to those who like a good action story but not so much to those fans of the dystopia genre.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun if you like bingo & have spare time...keeps me entertained :)<br />Free and fun is always good....lol<br />Worth a try :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The reason why I choose the rating is because I can't put it down. Also made me laugh and cry at the same time
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has very good graphics and is fun to play, it has many fun missions and keeps you satisfied.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.Pretty hard if you don't have a Facebook page,you can't do some 'missions'. But still pretty fun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting to play. The levels are really easy to reach just get lots of animals and you will be good. Kung fu scrat is a really fun mini game just slide your finger on the piranhas not the red puffer fish. Well I hope that all of you enjoy the game :)
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Hard to understand why there are any negative reviews on this unit.  I've had the Pulse for one week and it has worked flawlessly.  It has already proven to be a great companion 24/7.  I just slip it into my pocket and that's it.  I haven't had to charge it once in 7 days and it still shows 50% of the power available.  It Bluetooth links to my Samsung Galaxy Note3 smartphone.  So having that information available when I want to see it is awesome.  Then, for more details, I just log in to the Withings.com site and view ALL data on their newly upgraded page.<br /><br />If you want constant motivation of the actions you take or the sleep you think you are getting, this is perfect to follow your data. We also own the Withings wireless scale too!<br /><br />Just FYI, I'm an insurance agency owner who is incredibly healthy and active.  So no one suggested I write this or pushed me to it.  This PULSE piece from Withings deserves the positive review.  I once owned FitBit!  The PULSE out performs that unit in so many ways, there is no comparison.  Get this if you want to record your activity!  It just works!
B004UPIDIM|1.0|because the 3D movie cannot show in Trinidad and Tobago, how can i convert the movie to see it in Trinidad and tobago
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Yeah, this movie bombed at the box office. But if you enjoy an old-fashioned military flick (despite the insertion of aliens as The Great Enemy instead of Nazis or terrorists), this one is better than you'd expect. And the ending? It's a whopper, complete with grizzled old vets saving the day instead of those pretty-boy whippersnappers, LOL. If you have ever visited Pearl Harbor and stepped aboard the USS Missouri....well, in that case you MUST see this film!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I deleted this books from my kindle.  I did not like the content of the book and didn't want to read it.
B004PGO25O|3.0|Motivational, but I wold have liked a few more concrete examples and reasons for why we should do what we do. I preferred the book &#34;9 things successful people do. &#34;
0375842209|5.0|I read a lot of books. A lot.  Many are mildly entertaining, rather like sitcoms or cheesy detective shows.  Some others are very well written and interesting.  I read them all and discard most of them.  Though, I must admit, that's harder to do now since nearly all books I read are electronic.  This book, however, is remarkable in a number of ways, from the narrator personally to the individuals described.  Personally, I don't like hearing a long description of the specific plot of a book before I read it, so I won't lay that out here.  Suffice it to say, that most main characters are wonderful, kind, non-Nazi party Germans who cope with WWII on a number of different levels.  The narrator is extremely interesting, once you become comfortable with his, well, job.  Anyway, this is a tremendous book and I highly recommend it.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|I watched &#34;12 Years a Slave&#34; tonight, or should I say cried through most of it. A brutally painful, difficult film to watch, at the same time impossible to turn away from. As much as I have ever known about the atrocity of slavery in this country, nothing really prepared me for the intensity of this film. It is incomprehensible to me, hard to wrap my mind around, the fact that in this country, these things actually happened, that slavery festered like an abscess for so long as part of the history of this country, and that the vestiges of the &#34;peculiar institution&#34; continue to linger to this day, poisoning the hearts and souls of so many Americans who have the audacity to try to apologize and defend and minimize the profound impact it had on so many lives, and continues to have. To describe the film as emotionally powerful is to not do it justice. Steve McQueen is a brilliant director, unflinching as a storyteller, who has succeeded in eliciting from his actors some of the most powerful performances I've seen on film. McQueen makes frequent use of very long screen shots, holding the camera on the subject far longer than one would expect, often to purposely draw the viewer into the agonizing brutality of a scene, but just as often to focus on the raw emotion of a human face who has lived through unspeakable things no one should every have had to live through. The result is at once absorbing and intensely discomforting. McQueen spares us nothing in his portrayal of the barbarously cruel and complete affront to human dignity that was slavery, nor should he, nor should anyone....a film this raw and honest in its portrayal of one of the darkest volumes of our history as a nation, was a long time coming; far too long, I think. This is not a film that anyone should miss.
B005LJETYI|3.0|I don't know if it's because of the author or because of the translator but it's really difficult to understand the science behind what is going on in this book, although the idea behind it is pretty creative.  The author seems to love using an excessive amount of narrative hyperbole but the action scenes are well-narrated.  Overall this was a decent read that I was able to finish with minimal effort but I probably won't ever feel the need to read this book again.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|A nice movie.....a rags to riches movie and how it will change some people. Being poor, then gaining wealth sometimes changes everything about a persons character. Oh the deceived by riches!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|It makes you wonder about the money and power of Pharma and Food lobby. Incredible what they don't tell you.
B0019IB0II|4.0|This book was valuable to me in two ways.  It showed me that one can overcome the consequences of a stroke with hard work and perseverance and it taught me how to respectfully treat someone who has had a stroke or who has a disability.  It was also fascinating to read the step by step process through which the author travelled during her stroke and her recovery from it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The second book had me concerned that I knew where this story was going, but I am glad I read the third anyway. It was far and away the best of the trilogy.
0307888908|5.0|While this book says the same thing as a million books on professional success and the same thing as another million books on entrepreneurship, I'm giving the combination 5-stars since it is a fun and useful read with a few new frameworks (such as Plan ABZ). Here is the gist of the book:<br /><br />1. (Problem) The macro forces of globalization and technology means you can not rely on your employer for a lifetime of employment and learning.<br /><br />2. (Solution) Given this new reality, you need to run your career like a startup runs its business.<br /><br />3. (How) Here is how to act like a startup:<br />a. Never rest on your laurels or give up - hustle (but don't be a hustler) and persevere<br />b. Pay attention to your competition, striving to own a niche they cannot or do not serve<br />c. Have a permanent beta mindset: Pursue opportunities by taking intelligent and bold risk (have a Plan A that you specialize in, always be experimenting with Plan B to pivot if desirable with the knowledge that you can always fall back on the safe Plan Z)<br />d. Build a broad and deep network from which you can collect and synthesize information. Especially build relationships that expose you to different worlds. Share proactively.<br />e. Have well-planned, prioritized goals AND be flexible<br />f. Spend time on an ongoing basis figuring out what customers value and pay attention to WHY things are working or not working the world around you<br />g. Work in markets with natural momentum<br />h. Join or start groups of high-quality individuals with shared values
B008JFUPK8|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read some of the other 660+ reviews.  I just want to give a drive-thru evaluation of this movie...<br /><br />Man Of Steel (2013) is another reboot of the Superman franchise.  We had the Christopher Reeve movies, then Superman Returns in 2006.  I like the first two Reeve movies and I also like Superman Returns.  When it comes to Superman in general, I have a mild interest at best.  I'm a way bigger fan of Batman than I am of Superman.  Batman is mortal, so that's what's appealing right off the bat, not to mention the villains Batman faces are very interesting.  In contrast, Superman is immortal, so that changes the whole ballgame.  Anyway, about Man Of Steel...<br /><br />This movie's title is an indication that there have been an excessive number of Superman movies made over the years, so change was in order.  This movie has a ton of action in it.  Special effects of the CGI variety are used to the maximum.  Even with all the advances in computer generated images, it still looks too cartoonish and computerized, and this movie has a tremendous amount of it.  Way too much.  I think the action sequences are good, but I was distracted by the fact that there was too much action all while looking cartoonish.  When action sequences are used more sparingly, I can accept the cartoonish CGI much more easily, but the fact that there was way too much was a distraction.  A lot of the fighting that took place between Superman and his enemy was way over the top and some of it looked ridiculous.  I also think the story and plot suffered quite a bit due to the &#34;let's wow the audience with our special effects&#34; mentality of the makers of this film.  I did feel that the story was a little thin in favor of a special effects extravaganza.  Another thing I noticed is that this movie is darker in tone than other Superman movies, almost taking itself too seriously.  However, all of this aside, I did find the movie entertaining.  This Superman had a cool costume, maybe the best one ever.  The acting was pretty good.  Lois Lane was good.  Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe did well.  I found the movie entertaining because that's all I expect from a Superman movie (the good ones, anyway).  I expect to see, especially in this day and age, over the top action sequences and tons of special effects in Superman movies.  So while I was being critical of these very things earlier in this review, I'm saying now that I expect this kind of stuff in Superman movies, especially the modern ones.  Superman has super powers, just like how computers nowadays have super powers.  When you have a character who has super powers and you want to make a movie about him, you need to have super powered computers to generate the special effects that are needed to portray Superman's super powers to maximum effect.  In this aspect, the makers of this movie succeeded. though I do think it was OVERDONE.  I guess what I'm saying here is that when I'm watching a Superman movie - any modern Superman movie within the last decade - I'm enjoying it, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking about how I want to watch a Batman movie right after so I can get back to seeing a mortal super hero.  In other words, get back down to earth.<br /><br />So, with that said, I do recommend seeing Man Of Steel.d a cool costume, maybe the best one ever.  The acting was pretty good.  Lois Lane was good.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the few books that my teenagers read first. They loved it, then begged me to read it too so we could talk about the material. I couldn't put this book down!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books of the series and this one kinda was slow and dragged for me.  I definitely was not expecting the ending though and was quite frankly angry about it.  Series is still one of my favorites.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Great movie; lots of action and twists! What a great cast of actors. They will keep you guessing at how they accomplish all their tricks!
B000001F76|5.0|The Bible of Hank Williams!  All of the important songs that Hank and the band recorded with great singing and wonderful solos.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|it is a good app but -1 star because it doesn't run on my kindle 1st generation but runs on my second gen
B008LXZFH6|2.0|Humorous at times... Not a big Will Ferrell Fan. I watched the film for a project. BUT Love ELF!! Fin.
1416523359|5.0|I just finished this book, and I thought it was beautiful. I have been on a Stephen King reading jag-I have literally devoured 20+ of his books over the past six months- and this is one of my favorites. There were parts I found so astounding in their perfection I would stop reading so I could read it aloud to my husband. The idea of the pool where we all go to drink that is filled with language, myth, and all creativity, struck such a resounding chord in my soul I know I will never forget it. The love story feels real, but I admit I would rather read a love story written by a person who has been married to their spouse for forty years than some 'bodice ripper'. I highly recommend this novel. It has the chilling parts everyone looks for in a Stephen King work, (I found the long boy truly scary as only a partially revealed monster CAN be scary), but it has so much  more than that as well.<br />Also, in some of the reviews I noticed people were put off by how Lisey was portrayed as stupid, or as somehow unworthy of her fabulous, smart, and wonderful husband. That is not how I read this. From what I understood, Lisey felt she was stupid, and couldn't understand what her husband saw in her while he thought she was brilliant, and wonderful. His love for her was the only anchor he felt he had, the only thing that kept the 'bad gunky' away. I think that's real love. Maybe we can't understand what the other person sees in us, but we're thankful we have them.<br />All I can say in the end is read it. It's wonderful.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Very hart warming love story - I wanted to buy a bunch of romance story's so me and my wife could sit around and watch them on cold cloudy days. This movie is an excellent watch. Enjoy
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I would love to give this book more stars, but I couldn't. Veronica just let Tris die. I'm sorry that she did.  I know that she probably wanted to show how strong Four was, but she let me down by killing my favorite character. I am so sad that she let her die.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|this app could not be installed on my kindle. I don't know why but it just wont work. I do not like this app and was really looking forward.to it but it was going cray cray. I want this app not saying it bad but its stupid it wont download......
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Our book club read it and it provided lots of discussion points. It is really deeper than it seems initially.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Better movie than I expected. Denzel Washington's performance was excellent throughout. I won't go into any specifics about the film to give anything away, but I enjoyed the wild ride of this film, very intense at times.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Incredible book. Can't put it down. I read the first and didn't see how anything could really top it but the wise man's fear is just as good if not better. I was afraid leaving the University would make the book boring, as I love the grown up Harry Potter-esque kinda world of the University. Couldn't have been more wrong. As we leave the university things become more complex and interesting and its amazing to see Kvothe spread his swings and become the man we know at Kote.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Graphics are amazing - quest are sometimes hard but mostly fun.  Build at your own pace.  It's like the FB game only better!  And we're going to have a white Christmas come Dec 1st - it will be amazing!  I had been playing this on my iphone for awhile before i added it to my kindle HD - the sync is much better than Candy Crush, which i was afraid of - but no problems going from one platform to the other.  Come feed your own dragon - you won't be sorry!!
0761174192|5.0|What's not to like if you are a cat person.  Lots of new pictures to enjoy through the new year.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Written in such a way as to not only appreciate the efforts of the troops but keep the interest level in the reading.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Lots of action and special effects.  I was pleasantly surprised that the whole superman story line did get told in the movie.  I know I will watch it a couple of more times.  Characters are up to date good ones and bad ones.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Amazon prime had to relied several times in the first six min of movie do not think I'm going to waste my time to renew amazon prime

0061733199|5.0|Must have book if you are looking for a good guide that covers all the bases of survival. I like the layout he uses - you can skim the important points if you are in a hurry, and easily identify them. Or, read in depth on the subject. This is a comprehensive guide that has more information that most people will ever need or use. A great gift for the prepper in your family!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not sure what all the hype is about this book Zanes books are better it took me weeks to read this
B00CDIE0QW|2.0|Too expensive for a unit you have to use with a newer style camera. You have to have this unit to make the Sony Camcorder remote work on newer cameras. I think Sony should either step up and revise the remote to have the correct plug to fit the newer plug style, or offer this at a cheaper price point. I think $12 would have been fair - $25 is too much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun, easy to get addicted to! Other reviewers stated that they didn't like that you have to pay to get more &#34;lives&#34; or wait a couple of hours to continue to play. That doesn't bother me, I figure when I run out of lives it's time to put the game down and do something else.<br />The graphics are nice, game plays smoothly.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Crashes every time. Open fine and skill do a search.  But when you try to open the video it crashes.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I never saw the cover of this before reading so never saw the &#34;Thriller of the year&#34; stamp - regardless of this it sure was thrilling!<br />My opinion of the characters jumped around as the story evolved and left me turning pages well past midnight.<br /><br />Clever writing like this is such a pleasure and the characters bought me into their emotions and lives.<br />Please read this book if you like intrigue and mystery with a twist yet a good ole story along the way
B00GD9F59S|5.0|Oh gods, this book was just made of all kinds of awesome. I just absolutely loved this book and could not have asked for a better conclusion. I am so sad to have to say goodbye to Alex and Aiden and everyone else that I have come to love so so much. It is always bittersweet to say goodbye to a favorite series, but I can’t say I am in any way disappointed in the ending.<br /><br />Alex, I just love Alex. She is strong and feisty and stubborn. I love how her mind works and the random things she comes out with. It hurt me to see how broken she was in the beginning of this book; her fight with Ares broke her in a lot of ways. But she is Alex, and she remains strong. My absolute favorite thing about Alex is the character growth she has shown. She has grown so much since Half Blood and I love that about her. She has learned from her mistakes, and events have hardened her. She has gone from the impulsive stubborn girl to someone who is still impulsive and stubborn but someone who is willing to listen to logic and reason, someone who is willing to do difficult things for the greater good and someone who even supplies the logic every now and then. She will always be one of my very favorite heroines.<br /><br />Aiden St. Delphi…. Please excuse me while I take a second to melt over typing his name. I just love this boy. I don’t even know what else to say about him. There are so many wonderful things I want to say, but I don’t think words can truly do him justice. He is strong and kind and brave and charming. He is willing to do anything for Alex. He is always there for her, no matter what. He doesn’t try to hold her down and helps her to become a stronger and better version of herself. He says the best things and I swear every time he opens his mouth I fall more in love with him.<br /><br />Not only are the main characters great, but we have awesome secondary characters as well. Luke and Olivia and Deacon and Marcus and Apollo, I love them all. Deacon is easily my favorite. I swear, I crack up every single time he shows up. He is just hysterical and really all sorts of awesome. Then of course there is Seth, who we all love to hate. I have a lot I want to say about Seth and his character growth, but for spoiler reasons I won’t. All I’ll say is that Seth did things I never expected him to do.<br /><br />This book just delivered from page one. Of course it was heavy on the swoon and romance, it’s JLA, but it also packed a punch. This was it, the conclusion, everything for the past four books led up to this and it was awesome. There was non stop action and twists and turns all over the place. I got lost in the story and read the book in one sitting. I wish I had spread it out, because now it’s over and I don’t know what to do, but there was really no pulling me away from this book.<br /><br />As far as the conclusion goes, I absolutely loved it. It was not at all what I was expecting, but that made me love it even more. I love that it took me by surprise. I’m not going to lie, I cried like a baby. For a good portion of the last pages I was an inconsolable mess. There were lots and lots of tears, both happy and sad. I had moments where I freaked out and wanted to shake the book and make different things happen, but that is what makes a story great. When you become that invested in characters and their outcomes that it feels like real life.<br /><br />Sentinel was an amazing conclusion to one of my favorite series. This is a series that all YA fantasy/paranormal fans need to pick up as soon as possible! I loved taking this journey with Alex and I look forward to taking it again many more times.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This was a fabulous read! A lively and cleverly written tale which left you loving the characters involved - all for different reasons<br />Interestingly I think it will appeal for both male and female readers - good book to take on holiday maybe
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|The best and Jennifer is soo damn hot....funny and just dumb enough to love. Would recommended to everyone else in the world
B001Q7JD5O|3.0|Casting Jack Black may have pressured too many attempts at putting comedy where it didn't belong. The Dinosaurs looked great but it felt like this film was chasing Jurassic Park instead of the 1935 Original. The Dinosaur stampede was absolutely Ridiculous and the fight with the multiple T-Rexes looked like Kong playing Hacky-Sack with Naomi Watts as he did Gorilla MMA. The fight looked like it belonged in Kung Fu Panda. King Kong the creature itself was very good, he looked realistic and moved like a gorilla but the rest of the film was very weak. Peter Jackson made a King Bomb out of King Kong and could not match the awe inspiring feeling of the Original.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great twists and turns; I would have given it a five star rating - right up until the end. VERY disappointing!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is an excelent sharpener but it is for thin blades only!!! It will just dull thicker steel, i took a cheap knock off swiss army knife that has never dreamed of being sharp and this got it razor sharp, it works great for serrated blades too.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|An enjoyable introduction to Dexter.  Once I started the first episode, I had to watch it almost daily.  Interesting story.  Worth watching, although it is a bit of an unnerving story.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This is one of my favorite animated movies. I have the series, but my original Shrek became scratched after so many viewings , so I had to order this new  video.
014242921X|4.0|One of the better Steinbeck stories.  Enjoyable piece.  Would recommend for a high school student or college kid.  Classic piece and easy woven tale.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I have seen 3 different versions of this play, and I know several of the lines by heart. I loved seeing Nathan Fillian in this  version. I think &#34; Much  Ado About Nothing &#34; is so much fun to watch. What could be better, love and confussion and mistaken identity?
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|The movie was very entertaining and the actors did a fine job.  The director did a fine job and the computer work was very real.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! It made me laugh and cry. It is now my favorite book of all time. The author did an incredible job of writing this book and the P.O.V is perfect for a Holocaust novel.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really liked characters in the book and how their lives intersect in the story.  I think it was easy to figure out the husband's secret before it was revealed in the book, but I still enjoy seeing how each character dealt with their problems.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Wow! What an amazingly beautiful piece of work! I usually read straight through books, and can finish one in a day or two and go on to another. But this book was so captivating to me that I actually read for a while and then set it down just so I could absorb all the emotions and events before moving on in this grand adventure.  The characters are wonderful and real and unforgettable. It is a story that will stay with me  for a very long time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it!  Never boring. Addictive as all get out.  Look up and an hour has vanished. Would recommend to anyone.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The softwares' newest update is not working properly, so I had to downgrade the software, but it works for me now.
B001MM28JG|5.0|The film is funny, well produced and has a great cast!  this is one of my all time best sci-fi comedies!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|After finishing this book, I feel like I need to just rest.  This book will take us from England to Tahiti to Amsterdam to Philadelphia back to Tahiti and back to Amsterdam.  And a whole lot of places in between!  But the geography isn't all you'll learn in this book.  My word will you learn the world of botany.  This book must have taken years of research and a love of the sciences to accomplish.  You will also get quite an interesting lesson in Darwinism.<br /><br />Alma Whittaker was born in 1800 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Henry and Beatrix Whittaker.  From a very early age Alma was, like her Mother, quite a gifted scholar.  And like her Father, Alma excelled in the world of botany.  Neither of Alma's parents was particularly endowed with great social skills, and so, neither was Alma.<br /><br />Alma would stay in Philadelphia most of her life tending to her family and her plants.  It wasn't a bad life; there was no shortage of money or access to Alma's beloved library of books.  But it was an incomplete life.  And then Alma met Ambrose Pike.  And her life changed.<br /><br />You'll love getting to know Henry and Beatrix.  Especially Henry in his older years.  And you will fall madly in love with Uncle Dees and Roger.  Retta Snow will break your heart.<br /><br />Throughout the book there were times I became frustrated with \\"too much\\".  There was \\"too much\\" Tahiti and that part seemed to drag a bit for me.  But I get it; we needed to get to Tahiti to get to where we ultimately needed to travel with our dear Alma.<br /><br />There were so many times in this book that Alma's life just broke my heart.  There were times that I cheered for Alma.  And in the end, I chose to just sit back and think about her.  Here's what I came up with:  We all have a little bit of Alma in us.  We all want to love and be loved.  We all want to be taken seriously in our chosen vocation.  And in the end, we all just want to be remembered for the good parts.<br /><br />\\"Rest assured, dear friend, that many noteworthy and great sciences and arts have been discovered through the understanding and subtlety of women, both in cognitive speculation, demonstrated in writing, and in the arts, manifested in manual works of labor.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book is amazing!!! 5 stars! I wish the ending was a bit different, but otherwise superb! I'm pretty sad right now :(
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham books are always great.  As usual, I couldn't put it down once I started.  Waiting for the next novel.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Unusual and different approach to what is becoming a tired genre. Nice to get the story via recollections rather than a straight narrative.  A few misuses of words &#34;opium of the masses&#34; instead of &#34;opiate&#34;, for example, did jar.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Good story, rolls along and transports you back to small town southern USA.<br /><br />He spins a good yarn, John Grisham. And this is a very easy example of Grisham's trademark books.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|Stephanie is an amazing writer, of that I have no doubt. Certainly not after two amazing books like Anna and Lola.<br />People may say they think they resemble each other, or that Anna was better. But I disagree. Lola is just as strong and amazing as Anna.<br /><br />She's strong, unique, flawed and so very human in everything she does and feels. I want her as my best friend.<br />The characters in this book, like the parents, are so well-built that I wouldn't for a minute doubt they exist.<br /><br />And Cricket. Come on. I know St. Clair is darn gosh charming, but Cricket is the sweetest boy on Earth. Sometimes I wanted to jump him too.<br /><br />If you look closely enough at this book with an open mind, I'm sure you'll love it as much as Anna. Because they are companions in every sense of the word. Amazing companions.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love this game. Play it all the time. One of my personal favorites. It's really fun and is a great puzzle game.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved watching this series on the Beeb if you can watch it you will not be wasting your time,it is witty and irreverent somewhat based on the Sherlock Holmes of Conan-doyle with a wonderful modern twist i have not seen other programmes carry off.
B00G91Z8AQ|5.0|Zach Snyder is the BEST scif-fi action director - period! Man of Steel is another step in Snyder's codex of films that meld spectacle with great drama in as seamless a fashion as this viewer can imagine. I loved this film. &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is told as much through the lens of the camera as through the dialogue, and it brings the epic power of this epic tale to a visceral level that no one else who has tackled directing a Superman film has accomplished. Snyder has a singular style that lends itself beautifully to the limitless horizon that sci-fi tales portray, if one allows a bit of imagination to flood through one's own mind. Visually stunning, dramatically wrenching, and emotionally moving, &#34;Man of Steel,&#34; by necessity, takes the final battle between Zod and Kal-el to extremes because that's believably how the dynamic between these two would play out. And, really, if two foes had such powers, wouldn't the collateral damage logically be as devastating as Snyder depicts it? I think so. And either way, it's the best Superman film ever made!
B001VTTRC6|3.0|My eyes are glued to the screen with good movies, but you can take two or three naps during Mystic River and not miss anything. The best parts were when the overacting was beyond belief.
B008K5T5AI|3.0|Like all of Banks SF, it draws you in and keeps you in, but it's difficult to pin down why. It's the entire assembled package that shines, rather than any specific part. The Hydrogen Sonata has the expected helpings of satire, wit and wonder along with Banks usual mastery of character, place and the weaving of a story.<br /><br />For fans of the Culture novels, The Hydrogen Sonata extends the theme of the Sublimed and the overall focus on mortality and immortality, which is sadly ironic in light of Banks' subsequent death. Knowledge and understanding of the Culture itself is pushed forward by interesting aside and character interaction, rather than as a part of the direct story, as has been the case in the last few Culture set novels.<br /><br />It's expertly written with no more than a hint of the self indulgent chapters of waffle that editors let slip by now days in order to get a really thick book out. A joy to read and one I know I'll re-read in the future. If you're new to Banks Culture universe novels, I'd suggest starting on an earlier example. They're all good reads but by the Hydrogen Sonata it's so well known and developed that there is much that will mystify a neophyte. That being said, it stands alone and would only wet your appetite for more.<br /><br />Sadly, it must be the last Banks Culture novel, and yet the story is eerily appropriate.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This game is awesome, I love it! You won't regret getting this app. It is right next to talking Angelina on the best talking friends scale. Totally worth more than free!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Downloaded and installed fine.  I even really enjoyed playing for a few days even though there is a glitch which makes it impossible to add neighbors via Farm ID.  After posting my Farm ID on Facebook I finally had some neighbors.  Then I bought some in-game money. Now the game is borkedup and asks me to re-add my neighbors again everytime I hit the neighbors/friends button.  I do this and then go back to visit or gift and I get an &quot; assert error &quot; message followed by the game crashing. If you are going to take money from players how about addressing the constant glitches and crashes that make impossible to play.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Doesn't work that great on my Kindle fire. What a bummer as my young kids get a laugh out of it.
B00G2SIW7M|1.0|You went from one of my favorite bands to buying into the hype surrounding you, and creating bloated self-indulgent junk
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The normal super powered super humans are not this story good twist on the hero story line loved it will read firefight when comes out.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I'd  heard of Passion Pit a year ago or so, and heard them in one of (many!) commercials their songs appear in, but had never gotten hooked until this summer after seeing them at the Free Press Summerfest (FPSF) in Houston in June. Their live show is extremely energetic, and they sounded fantastic. (Some live shows don't sound as good as the recording, they sounded just as good or maybe better.)<br /><br />Michael Angelekos (the lead singer) is a very talented songwriter and musician; his lyrics are very personal, especially if you know of his background battling with mental illness (track 2, \\"I'll Be Alright\\", is a good example).<br /><br />Most of the songs have very electronic/poppy sound, but then there's ones like \\"Constant Conversations\\" (track 4) that is very soulful and melodic, be sure to check it out.  On the other songs, the catchy hooks and electronic beats are infectious, you may find yourself dancing in your car while listening to it!
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Did not see this at the movie theater but was told that this was and excellent movie. Can not wait to watch this.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is an amazing book. it can take anyone on an adventure throughout the seven kingdoms and come back with a great story.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It was good, but I haven't had the luxury of watching it consistently. Of course I would know more about the plot and follow better if that were the case, but I enjoy it overall.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Although I've never stopped being a fan, many times over the past 20 years, or so, I've wished for better. While Elvis has certainly grown as an artist and widely expanded his musical landscape, it's hard to match the focused brilliance of the early records. This new one may not have the fire of Peace, Love and Understanding, it's the most exciting music he's put on in a long time. Every listen reveals something new, especially if you play it loud. There is so much going on here, a certain  volume really helps to hear it all. What a wonderful combination of two different powerhouse entities that seems to have pushed both groups to some of their best work. Thank you, Roots, for offering the possibilities and, thank you, El, for meeting the challenge. I would love to see this live.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's a puzzle and still some luck. Free is good. Wish I had more instructions. Does the suggested match always mean that's the best March?
B00E6887H0|4.0|An exuberant Ry with topnotch co-conspirators makes for a really fun show. From Crazy 'Bout an Automobile to Goodnight Irene, it's a greatest hits list that well displays his versatility. Wish I had been there.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was an easy and enjoyable read. Unlike many on here, I did not read Time To Kill so can't make a comparison. The book was a fast read and plausible. The last 25% was not expected. Very much recommend.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love the ocean sounds & slow waves. The timer feature is great. I've set it for 15 min. & fall asleep so fast I never notice when it shut off.  I've also used it for some of my yoga practice as well.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Kept you on the edge of your seat! With nail biting action! Also had some twists and turns one doesn't expect.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|ESPLENDIDO!!SPLENDID! THESE VOICES ARE FULLY SPLENDID, I'm completely in love with these guys, highly recommend this if congratulations talent SPLENDIDO! Queste voci sono completamente SPLENDID, io sono completamente innamorato di questi ragazzi, consiglio vivamente questo se congratulazioni talento
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|This is an okay game. The object is to figure out what color of dot will open each of the hexagons. It can be a bit challenging which makes it fun. I would like to see pictures other than balloons to break up the monotony.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|This movie is cheesy in its own lovable way. I completely understand why it only got a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, but Tron: Legacy is one of my many guilty pleasures. I really enjoy it despite its flaws and I find myself watching it on multiple occasions.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|Totally what I expected from Maysa and more!  I've been a fan of her work since her days with Incognito. Her smooth and sensual voice and styling is why anyone who hears her for the first time will be an instant fan!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|awesome my hubby will love this holiday gift.  My husband is a huge fan and will love being able to view the series whenever he wants to cant wait for Santa to  stuff his stocking.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fabulous read. Follet does it again, explains history, this time contemporary events, in an entertaining engaging manner. I cannot wait to read the last installment.  While some of the characters may be a little far fetched, the reader learns inner workings of WW II. Highly recommend.
B00DY76Z32|4.0|Good Movie.<br /><br />PS3 does not like to play some blu-ray disks. I had this issue with this movie. Turn off 24Hz and it works.<br /><br />[...]
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|This was one of his better books in the last few years but he just drug it out too long.  I liked the beginning and the end but the middle just had too much filler in it.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|loved this movie, of course I would as some of it was filmed in my home town of Mason Michigan
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|.  Love this game my five year old grandson does too  I'm so glad it's finally come to the kindle
B003JXUXPW|4.0|This guy has an amazing voice. I heard his NPR music thing and then listened to his other album &#34;Be Good&#34; and had to buy this. It was a pleasure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I dont know why but this game is so addictive and I love how the story line is carnival style
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|Extremely England is a truly funny.  It could be a much better  book if it had been checked for problems which make it harder to read. If you pass this book up for errors you will miss a delightful work of fiction. This book is a cross between Fawlty Towers and Funny Thing happened on the Way to the Forum. It has plenty of dry British wit, silly situations, and puns even your kids will understand. I will look forward to more works from this author wit as much humor.
B00F87ZUYG|2.0|The group acts with no common sense, they were no armor, mask or gloves when fighting the zombies?, do not close cell doors at night in case someone becomes a ZOMBIE!!!!! (yes, zombie),  have not made good weapons for fighting zombies,  always low on gas for cars, but enough to burn zombies,  no good second line of defense.  They have dumbed down the series this year so much it is painful.  From a great series to mediocre.  Amateur 40 minutes (not even a full hour)
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Definitely worth the time and money. This particular season is dark, provocative, and literally insane. AHS: Asylum has great performances, and an amazing script.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Any red blooded American should love this film if you love political satyr and war movies with a sci fi twist.  So many great references to past great war/political movies.  But not for those that are sensitive to political humor.  What they did on the budget was fantastic
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The movie was good the name is just as good. Except you can control the robot in the game.<br />AWESOME
B0017HRCQU|5.0|it's an amazing gift for any batman fan or any movie fan! great quality and amazing items inside the box.

B003ZMF26W|5.0|Works perfectly. Thank you so much for the product. It's everything I thought it would be. Five stars all the way. Thanks again.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|It's nice to know that there is at least one other person that is more messed up than I am!
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|John Legend is one of the most talented artist in the music industry. Ultimately, he is one of my favorite artist. This is by far one of his best albums yet. Starting from 1-20 each song is unique, meaningful, and inspiring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and It is great for children despicable me is funny and challenging so get the game.
B00CHRBANK|4.0|Love the vibe on this album, I got the vinyl and I do note that my personal copy has some dust or particles upon removing it from the box.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of holding in my hand. Throughout multiple readings it breaks my heart, and brings me to face humanity, in ways even life cannot provide. Each character is a beautiful example of the human race, and every struggle so sorrowfully portrayed, every joy so celebrated. No matter how many times you read this book it will never be a waste of time. If you are questioning whether or not to let it take the time, don't. It is one of very few books that lives up to the statement; life changing.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my favorite bingo game!! I have it on my iphone & my kindle & I play it almost every day.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Liane Moriarty. I usually do not read this type of novel, but the reviews had me curious. Very thought provoking and full of human frailties. I thoroughly enjoyed the story.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|This is sort of a modern-day take on the theme of &#34;1984.&#34; Clearly using Google as a jumping-off point, it spins a dystopian vision of an always-connected world where &#34;Privacy is Theft.&#34; It's a somewhat intriguing read, but an implicit anti-tech screed beats at the heart of it. It's not unimaginable that the course of human society could veer in the malign (to me, at least) direction Eggers envisions, and to that extent it serves as a caution. But it's constant technique to warn us off is reductio-ad-absurdum.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|Unable to install on original Kindle Fire.  I'd love to play it but since they launched the game for Kindle Fire HD latest edition, nothing has been mentioned about making a release for the lower versions of Kindle Fire.<br />If you cannot deliver a product, please do not advertise it as available, that's simply false expectations.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It's a good, enjoyable film though not one of the all-time greats.  It had a few too many irrelevant subplots.  The political and social issues raised were interesting but not developed.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Commands are a bit different in the Kindle Fire as compared to using your mouse through your PC;  regardless, just as fun, and addictive!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The retirement home I'm in recently both read Martel's book and watched this movie. Loved both.  One thing about the movie: before it starts the harsh story with the survival in the lifeboat with the tiger, it gives an idyllic view of life in India.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies.  I just love the excitement and energy of the entire cast.  Great music and choreography.  Even when there are difficulties, it is easy to see the overall joy that these kids have, and how much they love their profession.  I have watched the movie several times...I'll tell myself that I'm only going to watch the opening number, but then I end up having so much fun that I sit through the whole movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read. Was true to the original story.  Knowing how Danny (Dan) Torrance continues with his shining gift- the good and bad- made for a satisfying ending to Dr. Sleep.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  It was very good.  Sorry to hear that something like that existed at that time.  It appears that sometimes it worked out for the better and then  sometimes it  didn't  Characters were interesting.  I would recommend the book for a book club.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|Horrible follow up to anything. She has an inflated sense of self awareness. This is dispoasable pop music at best.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|love these puzzles...keep more coming please<br />love this type of time use games...the 15x15 are really super I sometimes do the same one again to better my time or reduce mistakes
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very useful and easy to use.  Love the way you can go and see where you left off.
1401234550|4.0|Another impressive DC story with awesome art. I was not a big green lantern fan and took a chance on this, pleasantly surprised.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game requires skill combined with luck. It's challenging and highly addictive!  I enjoy playing this game and recommend it.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|excellent game. something to keep your mind busy but in an addictive way. definitely recommend this app for people who like puzzle type games
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I thought this was the game candy crush.  It is only a manual but no real clues.  Vvvvvvv gvvvvv vvvv
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great t escaped! I just loved it... I can't wait till next season.<br />Thanks Amazon for releasing it on prime!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love twitter love to follow my favorite stars to see what they are up too.  Especially dancing with the stars cast and everyone from general hospital and days of our lives
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|NOT for Kindle Fire 1st EDITION. Not until after I purchased did I read someone else's issue with this on the first edition Kindle Fire. I had the same issue. I was able to get through the first chapter and after that ... no luck at all. I am soooo bummed as the teeny tiny taste left me hungry for more! From the tiny amount I saw and was able to play the game is very unique in approach. Very disappointed and will be asking for my money back since it was not playable. Bummer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game too much.  I cannot to get my new games every time.  This game is so addicting
1476727651|2.0|Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this sequel, though I was looking forward to reading it. His last big novel, \\"11/23/63\\" was interesting, but ultimately boring with lots of missed opportunities for tie-ins to real history. There were also many factual errors which detracted. For \\"Doctor Sleep\\" I reread \\"The Shining\\" which certainly got me in the mood for the sequel (had not read \\"The Shining\\" in at least 30 years; hated the movie at first, but have come to appreciate it). Still like very much \\"The Shining\\"; it is a much smaller story than I remembered, which was nice. Like other reviewers, I though the first half of \\"Doctor Sleep\\" was engrossing; I really felt for Dan and his demise. But the speed up after connecting with Abra was a let down. The True Knot characters were not dark enough, and they did not seem like a real threat (no more so than traditional serial killers). The \\"twist\\" that Dan is related to Abra in more ways than one left me perplexed; why was this necessary? It was as if the relationship between Dan and Abra was getting a little too close without having a family connection, so Mr. King opted for this compromise. And then the hurry up ending just left me bored and page turning to get it over with. The same thing happened when I read \\"11/23/63\\". I think it helps to read \\"The Shining\\" first; however, my initial take on Jack Torrance from \\"The Shining\\" was that he was fundamentally a good and loving family man taken down by his demons and his own \\"shining.\\" Turns out from reading the sequel that he was actually NOT a good and loving family man; he had already betrayed his own family before heading off to Colorado, so the \\"twist\\" at the end of the epic fight was almost a downer. It could have been so much more than a slight family reunion. And why would the \\"ghosties\\" of The Overlook help Dan anyway? I always liked Jack Torrance regardless of his abuse of Danny; the sequel puts him in a different light; he was not only an alcoholic and abuser, but also a cheat. Oh well. Next time I read \\"The Shining\\" I will see him differently. This sequal was a decent enough read, but a disappointment.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My grandson lives this game I am ok at it but is very good at.  So I let him play it for me
B00008G8M4|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and I appreciate your prompt exchange policy.  I really enjoyed the movie and have watched it many times.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Lawdy...lawd...lawd....this is such a glorious CD ...SO gorgeous....impeccable playing as usual..but intimate &  Slow Train is stunning!...Buy this one, load your stainless steel thermos up with some sumatran and 1/2 & 1/2...order a corned beef sandwich at the deli (to go...)...get an arturo fuentes short story out of the humidor...and tell the kids and your old man that you are going out for some solo time....then, take the top down on your 450 SL...turn the heat up...head down hwy. 101...and crank this one....of course, it goes well over a can of spaghetti-os and a marlboro lite, but hell....one can dream.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I loved this book with such a passion, the lessons it teaches and everything is just great, by the end of this book Little Alex is your new best friend
030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson's trilogy (The Girl....) is a great story.  It keeps you reading until the very last I actually have all three of the books and was very pleased with the story.  I also have the movies with subtitles.  That should tell you something.  I consider this a classic of the Millennium.
B00F35B8F8|1.0|We had horrible picture quality, even when purchasing the HD version. Not satisfied with the purchase at all and have never had this problem before.

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Wow...what an awesome book.  This is one of those books that you hate to put down.  I kept going and didn't want to stop.  This book is captivating and very interesting.  The author did a wonderful job of developing the characters and makes you want more.  I recommend this book and look forward to the 2nd one.
B00008J2PG|5.0|it is a very good movie.  Gregory Peck is fantastic.  The history that surrounded the vatican at that time was amazing.  I am going to the vatican shortly and wanted to know a little bit of history of what went on during ww2.
B000T433CO|5.0|This is a romantic comedy for a modern audience! Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet play intelligent and talented women in their own rights. They are searching for love, and Winslet, in particular, needs to develop a bit more gumption. However, there is no implication that these women need love in order to create their identities or find fulfilling careers. I found this refreshing, as many movies give women the wrong messages about love. Both winslet and Diaz  cope with the holidays, and the destruction of their damaged relationships, by trading houses. One lives in Hollywood, and the other in Great Britain. The fun and romance soon ensues. In my book, this romantic comedy compares favorably with classics like &#34;While You Were Sleeping&#34;, &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34;, &#34;Sleepless in Seattle&#34;, &#34;Ever After&#34;, and &#34;The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain&#34;.
0071373586|4.0|Arcane 80s examples, but the message still resonates.  An essential read and one that can be completed easily on a 6 hour flight.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|its sort of fun, but whenever I shoot at the timber wolves and they're right next to me I shoot and they don't die.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Kept me turning the pages! I couldn't put it down. It's precise and to the point and I loved the twists and turns. Great read!
B000FA675C|5.0|I was a late reader to this, so it was already very popular and I knew what it was about.  In spite of that, it catches your attention and draws you in.  This was my first Dan Brown book.  I love how he takes history and mythology and twines them together to make a plausible action adventure.  It kept me racing through the book and on the edge-of-my-seat.  Great job!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You just can't beat a John Grisham story about Canton, Ms. and lawyers. Lots of twists and turns.  Always ready for another one to out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great!  the acting was super, the story kept my interest, which is not easy to do. I have never paid that much attention to a tv show.<br />I am looking forward to the next show.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Hard to follow this film.  Maybe with some mind altering substances it would have been easier to follow.  I get what they were trying to convey artistically but it wasn't handles well.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I read the whole trilogy of the &#34;Girl Who&#34; novels.  So sad that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us--he was a great writer and I would love to have read more novels from him.  I would highly recommend reading all three books.
B00G91WB3S|5.0|this was by far the best superman movie EVER. it's gonna be hard for any movie maker to top it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A fun game that is highly addicted and can also be soooo frustrating. Sync it through your Facebook account.  Enjoy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app,have it on my phone and have used it on that for over a year.Better than the Weather Channel.Far more accurate and much more detailed.Highly recommend.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you have seen The Hunger Games movie, I'm sure you loved it. But it cannot even begin to compare to the books! Great read, so hard to put any of them down! 10/10 all day!!!!
B00A8FXT8M|5.0|I loved the book! Very well written! Also a sad story about the life of a brave man who lost his love and endured the rest of his life without hope.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I rated three stars because it kept glitching  out . Other than that minecraft is good<br />But should add Redstone and boats _mine carts _ender_nether portals _especially<br />Villagers!also unlimited land or a lot.

B00B5C0YOO|1.0|There are no instructions on bow to use or retrieve.  It seems to run forever in the background and slowing down everything else.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game a lot...because you have to learn saftey rules and you learn lessons...not to be safe around trains!!! JK!!! :)
0439023491|5.0|My favorite book of the whole series.  I couldn't put it down!  Finished in two sittings and that was only because I had to sleep and work between or I may have read start to finish in 1 sitting.  Highly recommend this book if you have read the first one.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|This is one great read.  I love a book that makes me laugh out loud and I did in many places, once late at night, the book had me in a fit of giggles I had to suppress with a pillow for fear of waking my spouse.  There were also parts that made me cry.  Bridget stays true to her character throughout each novel.  It was great to see her again and catch up after all these years.  While I was not thrilled with the circumstances of her situation, I loved where this novel took me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent story written so BEAUTIFULLY. I've rarely had the urge to read a book for a 2nd time but the writing was so beautiful that I think I missed some of the genius wording while hurrying to find the next twist.
B00DU74U74|3.0|pretty cool, I love science fiction movies, but this one is different then most, I sometime was on the edge of my seat, and other times I found it boring.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is awesome and the graphics are phenomenal! I would have rated it for five stars but it doesn't run without wifi. Bummer.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I watched this movie a couple of times, but wasn't that great the second time. I was disappointed from what tom cruise has played in the past.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The animals are adorable. A game for the whole family.  The graphics look great on my kindle fire.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|not what I expected, I thought there would be more action in this movie and I thought the movie just moved around to much.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's really good. I find it VERY helpful!  I recommend it to everyone! I have it had it for about a hour, but it is very good!! ;DD
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Bingo is fun but to take overt 3 years to get your first crown is insane.<br />I don't find it fun anymore.
B00459EZLW|4.0|While not as good as the Stargate Atlantis series, the stories are entertaining without the usual spectacular [and sometimes annoying] special effects that one usually sees in sci-fi  pictures. Not happy with the ending. Won't go into individual stories as some do.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book keeps you interested in the ways of life you would never see it from. It brings you out of the light and into the dark.
B00AQL8VU4|4.0|This ste is very user friendly, It is easy to navigate and it provides a smooth search to an endless variety of products.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Holy Bible on my kindle. So easy to use and come very useful. When looking up scriptures
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you love music and documentaries than this is a must see movie for you. It is interesting to see how some of the most influential albums were created from the perspective of the artists as well as the people that ran the studio. I never knew how the studio helped create those albums.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the alarm clock. It works very well.  I have a hard time with my old oneThis clock is so easy to use
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best series!  I can't wait to read the next one.  The movies have been pretty good also!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a good app but it didn't go to the join have make new etc. It just says play game and I have no way of joining a game
B0026O475M|5.0|Great movie, Tom Hanks is spectacular in it.  Definitely recommend watching!  Good for the whole family to see together for fun.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I quite enjoy this movie, and the Blu-Ray has great picture and sound. It also includes a fair amount of extras, and they're almost all quite interesting.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a very good game. The different levels are so much fun. My favorite level is Arcade. It's quite a challenge trying to get through all the levels. Classic is there brand of Bejeweled, it's great! Mineral is cool! You have to break blocks by making matches next to them. Each level is loads of fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am enjoying it as well as trying to master the game. Still learning but it keeps me occupied. That's enough for me. So, I am addicted to it and I do hope to win all 3 stars each time. Good luck!
0385350864|1.0|This character should have been retired 15 years ago!  I too am the same age as the Bridget character and had hoped for some growth in the character an a little more sophistication in the writing. So enjoyed the Bridget jones of our 30's but the same frenetic style and complete lack of character development or maturity is annoying, and so NOT adorable.  A very disappointing missed opportunity  couldn't finish it.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|This game is a lot of unexpected fun. U goota love and appreciate a swinging tounge that can throw rocks and sometimes catch them on rebound. *two thumbs up.
B00CATSONE|4.0|As someone who is already aware of the general history of Nikola Tesla this book proved to be both painful and illuminating The author begins by piquing my interest as to why people who are successful seem to have this combination of a slightly higher than average IQ and a run of luck or good fortune. From there we follow Nikola's footsteps on a journey that is far from easy. The key to success and great things is outlined with Tesla's experiences and with important life changing concepts.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|From societal change to familial to personal, Switch gives a clear, cogent, and actionable analysis of making successful changes. You can take this book in bite-sized pieces, if you want to dip in on occasion. Even if you do, you will still be rewarded with plenty of insights on how to shape your own behavior and that of others.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|As an author and publisher, I have been following Amazon its entire 17 years. Amazon sells all of my books and I am a loyal customer.<br />There were many times when I wondered why Jeff Bezos made the decisions he made. This book provided the answers. I recommend this book to anyone in business.
B001NTJTUY|5.0|Totally instrumental soundtrack allows you to transend your mind to a most relaxing place. Great orchestration and composition by John Barry.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting and may be helpful for believers...but maybe not so much for some one who does not already believe.  I believe and was moved.
0739315293|5.0|I always love anything by Bill Bryson.  This book was so full of interesting information.  So much I didn't know about the twenties.  I'd recommend it to any history buff.  I always enjoy BB's wry humor and his way of telling a story.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|It was interesting in that it did teach me something about what I did not know (quadriplegics), but I found it too gushy, too obvious, too overdrawn, and I did not feel that the lead up to the ultimate resolution was compelling.  It was a romance novel, but I didn't feel really connected to the characters.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Does everything I want for an interval timer. Only four stars because the alarm bell sounds, while OK, are not my preferred.<br /><br />For the price (free) its great.<br /><br />Mel F.
1439199388|4.0|In dealing with an undefined autoimmune condition that my husband has developed, I found this book informative regarding new fields of research being done, and hopeful that maybe research coming up will be fruitful.<br />Some of the examples, research he used, seemed a bit vague in how they were tied to disorders, a bit of a long shot as being truly relevant to a disorder.<br />But I do find that I go back to it often in checking on theories and research, to find new research of my own to do.<br />Overall helpful.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Definately motivating, short but on subject. Worth reading if you're still on the path of doing something that you think you can't. I can and will! :-)
B005NHYXNU|5.0|Playful cute designs and easy to follow patterns and instructions. I've just started sewing and was looking for a book with fresh, contemporary, and fun projects.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|Auto wind is not reliable. I move my hands and arms around a lot. The watch stops unexpectedly. I've missed a few appointments because the watch had stopped working 10 or 20 minutes earlier. Have to keep checking against my smartphone. Total waste of money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I recommend this game for you. If you like pixels and mining buy this app .<br />You can play with friends and build ANYTHING you spawn on a world and go get supplies<br />for your house you fight zombies and spiders with a sword you can get armour<br />for your character Steve. This game is great for all ages.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I had already downloaded some of these tunes but I'm glad to see the full length recording.  they have a unique sound that I like a lot, kinda reminiscent of the band &#34;swing out sister' back in the day.  I look forward to hearing more of their music.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|I just finished watching \\"Man Of Steel\\" as a rental.  I had trouble watching it for a time.  With an hour left in the film it came to me how to watch this movie, and how to review and rate it.<br /><br />I watched and rated this not as a superhero movie, nor as a Superman movie.  I watched and rated it as a sci-fi alien-invasion-of-the-earth movie, like Independence Day, for example.  Based on that, I rated this with one star.  I'm not a fan of those kinds of films.  They usually have flimsy stories, rife with senseless symbolism, colossal explosions, epic-style special effects and lots of screaming, both in fear and rage/pain/angst.  This seemed no different.  And, in that light, How the story's hero defeats the villain is not surprising, or all that shocking, if one doesn't view this as a Superman story.  I found this relatively easy to do.  Then at the end, they decided to connect this alien-invasion story to a Superman character.<br /><br />I thought the writing to be shallow and obvious, the acting to be okay, the special effects highly proficient and boring, in the sense that they were really the story, with the actual plot and dialogue there to break the monotony.  I didn't like it.<br />I'm glad I watched it, though.<br /><br />Now, I will go watch a real Superman story, probably the animated adaptation of \\"All-Star Superman\\" comic-book maxi-series.
B000RLH2VM|2.0|Decent storyline and good action.  Predictable at times. This is a movie that you'll only watch once.  Nothing outstanding, but you might not feel like you wasted your life at the end.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I enjoyed it when I was bored or on a long car ride it was good can't wait till the next one
B00AQVN0CI|5.0|Firstly two things to note before you buy this one. This is a Region 2 (European) box set and is only going to play on a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player. Secondly, this does not include the 2013 Christmas Special as it has not been aired at the time of release. However, if you wait for the Region 1 (North American) which will presumably released at some stage it will be included.<br /><br />A new series of Downton is an annual treat, and as usual this year it is followed by the DVD compendium released just in time to give as a very welcome Christmas present. This includes the 33 episodes to date. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second, third and fourth, plus the 2011 and 2012 Christmas specials of which the first was a dramatic masterpiece, but the second did not deliver in the same way in the opinion of most people although it ended dramatically.<br /><br />The four series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1922. Each of the four series to date has had a slightly different background. Series 1 takes us to a very formal setting within the household with much concern about match making for the Crawley daughters to find them suitable partners which will secure the financial future of the estate. However, those above stairs are generally shown in largely a sympathetic light in their relationship with their servants below stairs and this sets the scene for the whole subsequent series.<br /><br />The second series takes us through World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for servicemen injured in the conflict. This quite different scenario provided the script writers with some interesting stories and the series runs from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 up to the end of the war in 1918.<br /><br />The first Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1920. The first features a very dramatic trial and this was probably the single best episode so far. In the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive.<br /><br />The second Christmas special sees most of the action move to Scotland, and a tragic conclusion which shocked most viewers and rather put a blight on Christmas Day for many. The fourth series takes us a little further into the 1920s and some relaxation of the divisions between those above and below stairs is obvious, although it still all looks like a rigid division to our contemporary eyes.<br /><br />A major source of story lines for the script writers has been the interaction between those below stairs and those above stairs. Quite a few of the main characters in both groups have been in Downton from the beginning and there are some very strong performances. However, I am not sure things would be the same without Maggie Smith as the matriarch of the family and she continues to dominate any scene she is in.<br /><br />If you are interested in the additional features, this DVD set includes all the extra features which were on the individual season releases. These amount to several hours of additional viewing.<br /><br />Personally I have been an avid follower of Downton Abbey from the first series and have seen every episode to date. I have now started to enjoy reruns of the earlier episodes. However, if you have missed out so far, then this DVD set is an excellent introduction to probably the best costume TV drama in recent times. Prospective purchasers should be aware that there will be a further Christmas Special later this year which is not included on this DVD set and there will inevitably be further seasons of the show, so whilst this is the definitive box set to date it will not remain so.sode so far.

B00BL9860K|1.0|As someone Who has read all of his books, I seriously doubt this was written by him. This is the most innane story and writing. Plot is terrible, dialogue childish......
1885167776|5.0|Yep, whether you feel you must write 100 Kindle Editions to generate enough freelance revenue to quit your day job, or have spent time researching how others found that one thing that led them to success - this book aptly explains how to do it. Outside of the book, the historical significance is huge: Du Pont family, with gunpowder supplied to US military in early to mid-19th century to present - Rockefeller family: Oil! (need I say more) - Hollywood and their industrial grade motion pictures - Microsoft's MS-DOS (one operating system generally used on the world's computers) - CNN, news piped in around the world - Amazon.com: Only books, originally, remember - Google, with one tag-team advertising service, AdSense/AdWords, that asks the world's web sites to pay each other to advertise on the world's web sites. All of these companies found the one thing they needed to succeed.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This is truely one of Paul's best solo albums. Ive been listening to this from begining to end almost exclusively since it's release, and it just gets better with each listen. The writing, production and performance on every track is as sharp as anything he's done in years. There is a sense of confidence and joy that has been missing in some of his past work (pre-Chaos and Creation) . There is only one song I think might have been better, and that is &#34;Everybody Out There&#34;. As it stands, I think it's a really good song, but of all the songs on the album, this is the only one that seems half written, something that was unfortunately common on many of his past albums. If he had only completed the 2nd verse rather than simply finish it with the &#34;eveybody out there&#34; refrain, and maybe added one more verse, I think this would have been one of his great songs, instead of being simply really good. Still, as it stands, the verse, chorus, and performance are so strong that it is terrific just the way it is.<br />I really like both songs he released as singles, but I can't help but feel &#34;I Can Bet&#34; was the most obvious and strongest song to be the single release. There's something about it that reminds me of &#34;Help&#34; era Paul.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I hadn't read the other Bridget Jones books, and at first I thought I might be put off by the diary style of most of the book. But it proved to be a fine way to present the thoughts that were always on Bridget's mind. The complicated emotions and logistics of dealing with widowhood, taking care of her kids, and getting back into the world of romantic relationships are presented in humorous and touching ways.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Behold, the Seven Levels of Cinema Hell: bad screenplay, casting, directing, acting, editing, special effects, and sound. Super Bro needs to ease off on the teeth whitening; the glare from his Hollywood teeth was very distracting throughout. The plot reminds me of feeling nauseated - I felt vaguely disturbed by the feelings passing over me while watching MoS, and was constantly preparing to jump up from the catch and run out of the room. Yeah. That bad. I'll say it right here. Henry Cavill gives me the creeps. I can't shake the bizarre impression the young man is a replicant of some sort. If Darth Hayden beats out Henry in pure emotive capacity. I have at least a vague sense that some degree of Force resides in that HC, however not so much in this one. Remarkably, Director Zack Snyder manages to draw stolidly wooden performances from Hollywood illuminati as well. Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Richard Schiff and Laurence Fishburne all seem to be under the influence of kryptonite. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon try hard to chew the CGI scenery, but they were clearly dissatisfied with the meal. Testosterone injections could elicit similar raging cube-steak performances from the average computer nerd in a dim bedroom. Yeah, there are some vague Jesus allegories in here as well, for those Christians looking for a cinematic super-hero subtext for their faith. Ahem. Anyway, MoS doesn't even rank in the Hot Mess category because there is not heat. Themes are compromised of vainglorious murk held together with possibly the most ridiculous string of lame film homages ever assembled in one film. This may in fact be the highlight of the chilly MoS experience, but it comes across less as a directorial inside joke and more as some variety of creative palsy. As for visuals, I can say I have never seen a Kryptonite as creepy as the Zackster's, even in the darkest DC comics of yore. It seems like the product of a poor night's sleep after a greasy dinner. The American Midwest doesn'tlook much better, except somehow there appears to be king crab fishing in Nebraska. Sheesh. You Hollywood types need to get out more. Ok, I have beat this hobbled pony enough. One last thing I must add, in the form of a question. Who in the name of Jor-El would want to have a super hero defending you who destroys entire urban areas in the process? Piece of advice for Man of Steel: lure Zod to a less inhabited area before engaging in your struggle to the death, for pete's sake. At least the suburbs. The damage from your sloppy villain fighting would then rise only to hundreds of millions of dollars, rather than the trillions of damage you dimwits caused throwing each other through skyscrapers. Zod monologued plenty long enough for you to lure him outta town, ya dumb showboater.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Not to bad so far! I'm learning to be Leary of these games. I start to like them and play them and then spend money to advance and then get screwed some how! So I am being  cautious. Love the graphics and characters and music. So far it is fun and entertaining! So far I would recommend it for any age.

B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Looked like it would be pretty creepy, but turns out it was more like a teen romance until last little bit.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is so fun I'm glad I got this for free on my kindle fire HDX it's not like other racing games to me because it's better.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I've recently come to enjoy Mr.Stevenson work, and I must honestly say I am never dissapointed. Solstice is a page turner that will keep your heart racing.  Another job well done.
B00BATG18K|4.0|Follow the tenuous relationships among three generations of women who endure and succeed because of and inspite of their strong wills. The story takes place on 2 continents from the late 19th century through the prewar years in China and the US.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love being able to play Facebook Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire HD.  I can play it in any room of the house instead of being stuck at the PC.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked the book and the story it has twists and turns I never saw coming. I wish the ending was a little longer sine it seemed rushed but a unique ending that I never saw coming
B00BAXFAJC|1.0|Nothing is worse than a 21st century writer affecting the style of a 19th century writer poorly. The story telling is tortured and disjointed and at times down right illogical.  Her vocabulary is asynchronous and off putting. I really don't see how this received so many stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've downloaded several bible apps this was by far my favorite. Easy to use, multiple versions of the bible available, even some that would read the text for me whle i  was driving
B004I1K430|5.0|Superb acting by the two leads, and very good supporting by Helena Bonham Carter.  Excellent presentation of a piece of British history -- and to think they produced it with no violence or sex !!
B00ERIUO02|4.0|It's pretty catchy! I'm glad a bought this limited edition version to add to my collection. Unfortunately the only criticism I have of this is that Katy Perry's songs tend to start to sound the same, her voice just doesn't vary between songs.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I loved this book. It is amazing. Francis Hodgson Burnett is an amazing author. I have read a few books by her, such as The Secret Garden and A Litlle Princess. I recommend her if you like sort of old time books.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|So inspirational I loved hearing the stories of Chris Kyle and finally understanding what war is about so amazing so amazing
0399159347|5.0|The book took me a little while to get into because it was written in such a unique way that I found it hard, initially, to keep track of the characters. Once I caught on, though, I couldn't put it down. The characters were so well fleshed out, so real and human, and the story was a fascinating one. Every thought, every movement, every word of each character resonated with authenticity. Rarely have I come across an author who has so accurately captured the pulse of the human spirit and psyche, and who can write so engagingly and impeccably. This was one of the best reads I've ever had, and this book and author have my highest recommendation.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I liked the game. I would like it more if it didn't change so that I HAD to b connected to WiFi to play it

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game but I am an adult, I am not on facebook.  If I want to blow an evening playing a game I should be able too...not running out of lives!  it is fun though.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Once again Veronica Roth delivers an extraordinary story. Is it perfect? Probably not. Did it have the perfect ending? Maybe not. But life is not always perfect, we just have to be aware of moments that make us laugh, gives us hope, and allow us to love one another. Tris is and will always be a true heroine, because in the face of chaos, death, and despairs she chooses love. And most importantly, she chooses to be brave.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Giving it a try, but it does not seem to respond well to touch on my kindle fire screen.  It was also very, very slow to load.
B008JD7VZM|2.0|My kids love playing minecraft on the computer and they have an interest in Lego. So, when I saw this, I was like, wow... the best of both worlds! To my dismay, they stopped playing with it after two days. Then, I lost some of pieces (they are really small). Not worth it, IMO.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|It's addictive, the only problem is it's over too soon.  I really enjoyed it, but once I went through all the puzzles it's no fun to start over.
0553801473|5.0|George has done it again. Written yet another phenomenal, mindblowing tale in the song of ice and fire series. This book is impossible to put down and the ending left me in tears. cliff hanger to the max, i'm now eagerly awaiting winds of winter because obviously, Mr. Martin will thrill me again.  Take your time George, the next tale in your legacy is always worth the wait :)
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Played this on Facebook and really liked it. I am glad that they finally put it on the kindle. Very fun game to play on the down time. Bravo...... keep the missions coming.
006202406X|1.0|*spoilers* I followed the divergent series and I eagerly awaited the third and final book. I tore through allegiant, mostly satisfied throughout. There were a few parts that I thought were hastily thrown out without much explanation and the switching between tris and Tobias had me thrown. But the last 60 pages of the book ruined everything for me. Not only did I spend that time bawling my eyes out I spent it getting more furious with Veronica Roth. What was she thinking? You don't kill off the main character, and so arbitrarily and needlessly. I couldn't even be satisfied with the epilogue because I kept feeling how needless her death was. Readers get so close to the main character and we had the better part of three books to fall in love with her character, to relate to her, to really feel like we know her. It's so sad that it ruins the series for me, I have all three books but don't think I will ever feel the urge to re read them now that I know how terribly it all ends. It was all just very disappointing.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Great movie. A Shakespearean like tragedy with a feel good ending.  Worth a watch, great music throughout.  Some parts hokey, but the beautiful scenery over comes it. War scenes not for the faint of stomach.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|As a kid I liked reading this book. It captivated me and it still does even though I'm an 8th grader.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This also is addictive, I play it a lot .  It seems like only on weekends are some of the helpful powers unlocked.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very good product and easy to install and use, it still need to receive some apps to add more features but it's incredible how easy it works and how far it can go with just firmware updates from google or custom firmwares
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|Outstanding performance by Eric. The video looks much clearer. The sound is great. All of these songs are solid blues songs. If you like blues guitar and/or Eric Clapton then you'll love this product.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Hard to get into at first, but really picked up toward the end. Got really interesting 3/4 of the way through
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Another fine Pendergast novel created by the talented and gifted minds of Preston and Child. Read it and be rewarded.
0810993139|5.0|I adore this book, it's awesome because it's funny and it speaks the truth of a life at middle school.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Bought this collection a while back. There was a lot of extra information about the films included. The texture of the box makes it feel old and sophisticated. I keep it locked away and never lent it to anyone. (I would lend my 65in tv before I lend this). Its a memorabilia with much emotions attached. About once a year me and my family sit and watch all three in succession, and it never gets old.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|It's compact, easy to carry with you but becomes hot when it's working. I think apple should think how to solve it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm not much of a game person on my phone, but there's something about this game that just makes it addictive, and the most played game I have.<br /><br />It's fun to keep trying to beat my previous best with the different vehicles, and it's nice that the developer updates it often with new vehicles or locations.<br /><br />For some mindless addictive fun, this one is a great pick.
B00AEFYS8G|4.0|Sort of a unique western.  I pondered what the plot could be as it wasn't crystal clear.  But at the end it seemed to come together.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I love it.  It is such a study of human beings, men and women that have choices.  The need to choose between living lives out of bitterness and anger or lives which are fulfilled and joyful.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is by far one of the best books I have ever read. It tells the story of a girl who has cancer and chooses to be anti-social. While in a mandatory weekly meeting (as made sure of by her mother) for those who suffer from cancer, she meets someone who catches her eye, whose name is Augustus Waters. He soon plays a large role in Hazel's life and changes her point of view on things. I laughed and cried while reading this book and I have never thought abut life so much after reading a book. I recommend this to all teens and adults, you wont regret picking up this book.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|While not exactly Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, it is nevertheless a very satisfying love story where in time and distance only make the heart grow fonder.
B009GXHOW4|1.0|This app is th  worst because it present Evan let you do anything!!!!! That is terrible!!!!! I was all ready to get my game on, and it won't even let me play!!!!!!! WORST APP EVER!! I DO NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO GET THIS APP!!! DO NOT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Some CD players do not segue properly.  Needed to create it's own playlist in iTunes to play as original.  Do know if repackaged or Remastered.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very disappointed.<br /><br />I bought the device with big hopes of streaming content from my Android table to the Chromecast. Temporarily, this was even working, with an app called AirCast, but Google has clamped down on such apps and has not released the API for public use yet. This after the device has been released for so many months.<br /><br />But even the features that the device have seem to be deteriorating. I use it a lot for Youtube for my daughter, playing nursery rhymes and other kids shows for her. When I initially got the device, it worked perfectly. But lately, it has started stuttering on some videos, and other videos it will even completely hang. I think a software update by Google must have broken it, since it used to work find, and it only happens for certain videos. The one nice things I still use it for is streaming flash video from my laptop to the TV, but the quality is only so-so.<br /><br />Finally, additional apps for the device have been slow to come. Only Hulu and Pandora were added to the selection of apps since the launch. Still waiting on HBO2GO and a decent app to stream media from my local network.<br /><br />Overall, I thin you are better off with a Roku box, if you can live with the lack of Youtube on the Roku.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It was just OK. Not great, not boring, but OK. I thought it was an interesting take on the zombie scene, but had some moments of poor execution.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can read all three books over and over I absolutely love it.. Cant wait until the movie come out
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|This particular novel by Jo Nesbo had some unexpected moments of lightness and tenderness which most of his Harry Hole stories do not. That said it is still a dark story about violent death, alcoholism and drug abuse. While it is a very good read it isn't quite the &#34;stay up all night&#34; to see the ending that most of his books are.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Well I love to play it and it very addicting but it could be better if it had customizable characters since the only choice is a guy. It would also be good if you could add color to the vehicles, especially since it takes so long to get to the next upgrade.
B000069KE0|3.0|Expected added fidelity/Remaster.  Still a great, great album from one the top American Bands.  Certainly not Amazon's fault.  Perhaps a simple repackaging as title implies.
B00000IQC8|2.0|A black and white snapshot from the 90s tucked into a hipster scrapbook.<br />Almost occasionally funny.  Not convincingly significant, IMO.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|I've downloaded this for my new Kindle Fire HDX and the app crashes each time I try to open it .  Update 11/21/14:  App update seems to have fixed the crashing issues and is working fine now.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. Makes you 're-evaluate everything that happened in your life, but this time with a big 'what if....'
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what a challanging game. I can't wait for more rooms. it's such a cool idea for a Game. Each room has a new puzzle to figure out.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|great movie, brad pitt is the best. did not leave any thing to wonder about how it would end and who would win
B008V59AF2|5.0|Another great and classic album from my youth.  Heard a song off it, not heard in years and the next thing I know is, I be here typing 'cause they be no more easy way to get this suck than order from Amazon.<br /><br />As I live and breath; I LIVE and BREATH.
0399255370|5.0|This was a gift for my 7 year old son and we LOVE this book.  It's funny and entertaining.. all kids love coloring and drawing so it's extra cute to hear the perspective of all the crayons in the box.<br /><br />The crayons in the book belong to a boy named &#34;Duncan&#34; so all the letters are written to &#34;Dear Duncan&#34;.  My son actually has a friend named Duncan so we obviously had to get it for him - and he adores it.  This will become a classic!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Very clever interwoven storyline for those with some Star Trek history, some of it will be lost on those who don't what the trouble with Tribbles is.  Some of the story line seemed forced and predictable - not sure Abrams needed to interject the cameo by old Spock, nor do I need to see young Spock reprise Shatner's KHAAAAAANNNNN!!!!.  Fun special effects.  Don't think too much when watch them and you'll enjoy them a bit more.  Grab some popcorn and have fun with it.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|I have loved this album since it first came out.  the emotions--ups and downs of the sixties are present in the songlist.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Loved this film. Well acted and compelling. Also heartbreaking. Lots of great detail in the relationships between the main characters. But, really heartbreaking.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|Great series, however, it is missing the last 3 episodes: the waters of mars, and the end of time parts one and two. Fortunately, I was able to view those episodes on another streaming service.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Profound. That's all I can say. The things this man went through is something none of us could ever dream of comprehending.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is a fun and not too difficult of a game.  The kids had to teach it to me, but it is a winner.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This is the first book I have read by these authors, and the best book I have read in months! THIS book will keep the reader guessing throughout the book. I will be reading more from these authors!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing this game on Facebook when my friend sent me a request for help. After the first game I got addicted and couldn't stop playing. Even when I got stuck. It is a simple game they found a way to make harder.
0321399536|4.0|What is there really to say in review to a classic? It's a shame that more people haven't read the real story of Frankenstein and instead believe that what they see on television is the real thing. If you haven't read it, you should. It's pretty much that simple.<br /><br />I really enjoyed going through the Longman Cultural Edition of this book. Yes, I'd read the book before in literature class at university (or at the very least, I read some of it and listened to the discussion) but I never delved into the sources that this edition offers. It's great to get a view of the story telling pact and what came out of that as well as how things were perceived when they first came out.<br /><br />It gives a lot of context to the story itself as well as helping the reader understand the story better as well as the culture that this tale came out o
B00EYRNGYM|5.0|Well written, not without humour (why didn't I expect that?), and adding some new views on the background and life of Bach.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I did not care for the switching back and forth of the character narration.  Spoiler alert:  I thought that killing off Tris was unnecessary to the plot.
1439177791|5.0|Great Memoir of the Actress Portia de Rossi, and the way she overcame her eating disorder and came of age.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is awesome. The artwork is amazing, the game is challenging and fun. It is similar enough to the first so you can just pick it up and start playing but different enough so that it feels new. I only wish the heroes didn't cost so much to purchase considering that you have to pay $3 for the game, but I understand why they do it and they do have sales occasionally. This game is a must buy for any kindle fire owner.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Allie's book is intensely personal.  She shares about her depression, suicide, and bad dogs.  Tragic, evocative, darkly funny.  I'm ready for her next book
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|in a symbiotic process, the ART became POP into this masterpiece!<br />Gaga is the past, the present and the future of the Pop music!
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|It's great music, her voice is amazing, words that touch the heart.. I saw the artist on a late night show and knew I had to have the cd.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I hesitated to watch Downton Abbey until this year because I thought it might be a bit stodgy and maybe boring.  Wow, was I wrong! I have watched every episode and look forward to seeing the next one.  I actually miss all of the characters when they're not on screen and wonder if they're okay and how they're doing.  I can't wait to begin Season 4.
B001ILHY1I|5.0|Excellent DVD,  shipped fast  Received the exact item ordered with no problems.  Highly recommended DVD.  Will be ordering more for gifts this Holiday
B002M5E2DW|1.0|While I think there is a lot to be said for being and thinking positively, both in making you happier and in affecting other's perception of you, which, in turn, can bring more success in life, I don't buy into thinking about something to bring it to you.  I was also a little offended by the focus on bringing huge amounts of money, luxury cars, etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is fun, entertaining. I think I would recommend this app to people who love horses. So even if you not CRAZY about horses try it! I think you'll find yourself to like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is by far the most challening of all the games I've purchased for my Kindle, second is Scrabble.<br />I love love Candy Crush Saga.  I wish I could find more games that are so addictive.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br /><br />I'm so sad right now. The ending did nothing to better the story. I read an interview with Roth saying, &#34;Tris' story had to end like this because she is finally doing something truly selfless and it shows she's an adult.&#34;  On top of it all, she acknowledged this was her intent from the beginning.<br /><br />WHAT?!?! She's a teenager. Allegiant is not a great book because of many flaws other reviewers have mentioned. I acknowledge that as the author, she has a right to craft her story as she pleases, but I don't trust Roth after this and I can't imagine reading her work again.<br /><br />To invest so much time into this series, only to have it end so pointlessly, is a betrayal of the readers' trust.  I would not be surprised if this severely damages her career.
044024630X|5.0|The Jack Reacher Novels are my favorite series I have read so far. Lee Child does a great job writing books that grab your attention right from the start and never let you down. I have read all of the books and not one has let me down.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This second installment of the Kingkiller Chronicle is as immersive and engrossing as the first one. I am very interested to see where this journey goes.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I ordered this thinking it would fit my iPhone 5C.  No luck -- the phone was too large for the case.  When I tried it on my friend's iPhone 5 it fit like a glove.  I liked the protective feel and orange color, and I like that the color panel is interchangeable.  Sad it did not fit my phone.  Wish I had paid more attention when ordering, but I didn't know there would be a difference in size among the 5's. It will make a great stocking stuffer for my friend!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Passes the time, however waiting or having to buy new lives is seriously annoying since it is so addictive. Fun overall, though.
1118109791|4.0|Good but not enough. It will give you a general idea. To get a high score 660+ you will certainly need to buy individual books for each area of study. I had a collection of 10 books. Buy them USED on amazon like $8/per book. Previous edition! but worked same way
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This series is fun and the entertainment continues with the second book. The competition is fierce! The reality aspect of the book is highly entertaining. Totally recommend.

0385537131|4.0|4.5 stars<br />I think this is Grisham's best book ever and I have read them all. Grisham's best ability is as a storyteller.  He may not be the best author but I can just picture him on a big porch in a rocking chair, a pitcher of sweet iced tea at his elbow telling a story to all sitting there. This book has a wonderful sense of place and you can feel the sticky heat, hear the mosquitos swarming and enjoy the slow place of a life lived in the South. Some of his books are like riding roller coasters such as &#34;The Firm&#34; but this is a slow paced book that ends explosively. The ending will stay with me for some time. I highly recommend this book.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Beautiful. This album is such a classic and great addition to any vinyl collection. I love listening to Come Away With Me on rainy days.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|In this case, my review is for the MOVIE, not the DVD itself, although I have no complaints about that part either.  I love this film, and was pleased to find it for a reasonable price.  Seller filled & shipped my order promptly, and I received it in much less time than I anticipated.
B000FBFML6|4.0|A wonderful series of books. This book is an easy read and take you into another world.  Read if you want to escape.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Wonderfully fascinating, compelling characters, beautifully written, brilliantly researched. I was completely absorbed throughout and disappointed when it ended. A dense book but highly recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, cover to cover. I rarely give books a 5 stars, but this one was sensational ! We find out what happened to that beloved character Daniel Torrance, great story with lots of character development. I think this book opens the door for a third, I will leave that one up to the brilliant writer,  Mr. Stephen King.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Adele is an amazing artist. So, Adele plus vinyl, is an excellent listening experience. I highly recommend Adele on vinyl!!
0316055433|2.0|Let me start by saying Secret History is one of my favorite books. Having heard of this as a literary triumph better than History, I was really looking forward to reading it.<br /><br />While a certain amount of hype has been bought and paid for, the rapturous reviews of this book leave me wondering how intellectually bankrupt this country must be to find this work brilliant.<br />It is brilliant only if you think  Gone Girl was brilliant. Which is to say it is uneven, speech-y instead of profound, and badly in need of one of the editors of yore.<br /><br />What I did like: the plot is creative, the work is ambitious, and the first 1/3 is engrossing and addictive.<br /><br />What I didn't like: there are plot twists that are beyond absurd, there is far too much self-congratulatory philosophizing stuck in at the end in incredibly forced exposition. The end reads like student work. The characters are unlike able, and there are pages, pages and pages of drug addiction descriptions that begin to read like pornography. Characters are thinly drawn, and plot lines are left more unresolved than resolved (not for ambiguity's sake, because it seems she just forgot about them).<br /><br />The brilliance of the Secret History was that Tartt was writing from her own world. Every detail, no matter how unlikely, rang true. History is engrossing at every turn. Goldfinch is so off from reality that it at points becomes unreadable and even laughable. Her notions of adoption, investigation, terrorism, male mindset, and the mental and intellectual capabilities of children, are naively imagined and poorly researched, as are all of the relationships between characters. Goldfinch reads as intellectual writerly masturbation. It reads, in all honesty, as childish and undergraduate, while History, her undergraduate novel, reads as stunningly mature.<br /><br />It bothers me as a reader when middle brow novels are held up as great, brilliant, and intellectual. This is an ambitious book and aninteresting book, but it is not a great book. It's an elevated pot boiler, and it's at points unnecessarily hard to read. If this is the height of<br />American letters, we should be very worried.
B0083Z614S|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Loved having a e version to read to my granddaughters on our 2 week summer trip this year. They wanted my Kindle to read it themselves at bedtime! Couldn't wait to hear what happened next. I LOVE being able to intill that kind of enjoyment of reading in them.
0553582011|5.0|Well what do you expect its the Song of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin.  This is the stuff of legend!  If you want to watch HBO's Game Of Thrones then you must read the books or you are missing out on 60% of the story.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I didn't find this series until all the book were out which was great because I could read them all back to back. I did hesitate to buy this one because of the reviews. I did not read any spoilers but it seemed there were a lit of people that did not like it and from what I did read I got the impression th at maybe the author had rushed the last good due to popularity and pressure to get it out.<br /><br />Well I could not resist, I had to know what happened, and in my opinion this was a great ending to this series. Due to the poor reviews I was expecting it to be poorly written and to leave me hanging however that is not true. I like how it was written from 2 pov and kinda wish now that all the books had been. I also loved the ending it was true to the characters it was unexpected but at the same time it really could not have ended any other way.<br /><br />Don't let the bad reviews stop you from reading this final book. You may love like me, or you may hate it like many others, that is just the way the book is, but when you have a lot of people that love a series you have to expect some to be very upset when it doesn't end the way they want it too.
B005LAJ22Q|2.0|the season is fine but the discs had problems had to return. best season ever if i could watch it.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game is awesome needs more lower level quest....but still awesome to play....and also needs to fix where people can play together on ups and android systems...
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Mindless drivel, simplistic writing, and poor character development. I couldn't get past the first few chapters before I put it aside.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Have read it so many times my hard copies are tattered. Love having the e-version.Now I can read it whenever I am in the mood.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use pinterest every week to meal plan and find new recipes. it has been especially helpful with finding new vegan recipes.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The man entertains.<br />Lyrically intricate and unique yet again, the songs span dark and angry to funny. He raps over classic rock beats in a couple tracks (wasn't a fan at first) but then I realized the man could rap over the sound of a washing machine spin cycle and make it work. He flows for 18 tracks...buy it if you liked Mathers 1 and Eminem Show because he still does it better than just about everyone else. I respect his skill and was entertained the whole time.
0812983459|4.0|Absence really does make the heart grown fonder.  As Harold sets off on his very impetuous and unplanned pilgrimage to see an old friend who is dying of cancer, he leaves behind a wife he is estranged from, a son he hasn't seen in twenty years, and he recognizes how unhappy he is.  He doesn't know how to fix things, and when he receives Queenie's letter telling of her cancer, he somehow decides he must do something.  He leaves the house to post a letter to her and doesn't return.  Harold has begun walking, and he has six hundred miles in front of him.  He has left behind his cell phone.  He has only the clothes on his back and a pair of yachting shoes on his feet.<br /><br />Harold is wonderfully likeable, but so is his wife, Maureen.  She worries about him, is proud of him and lives for the phone to ring.  Harold calls her regularly from pay phones and borrowed cells and the unspoken love in those calls is poignant.  She does her best to take care of him, long distance, but, although she wants him to come home, she begins to see that he must complete his journey and see Queenie.<br /><br /> As Harold continues walking, he begins to receive some notoriety...and along with this, other pilgrims who join him.  I felt this was to the detriment of the story.  Perhaps the author felt he needed more characters, but I disagree.  Harold meets a sufficient number of other people on his trip. These folks who walk with him could have been omitted from the book, and fortunately they do not remain for long.  Harold wants them to be gone, but he doesn't want to be rude about it.  Thankfully, they leave on their own, and we have Harold (and Maureen) all to ourselves again.<br /><br />Very sweet and enjoyable.  Makes you want to put on your own, metaphorical, walking shoes.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|[[ASIN:B004UID2LC FREEdi YouTube Downloader]]I would just download the regular YouTube site and register. Then get the FREEdi YouTube Downloader. I have never had any problems with that app. Also load MX player and all the videos, movies etc.that you downloaded to your device will be there for you to watch off line that you wish. I have about 100 items downloaded into my Nexus 10. You can also make a play list  in YouTube which you can watch all the videos and movies you wish when on wifi. I have 60 playlists and over and about 2000 items with 1000 of those movies. I down load the ones I really like so when I am on the go with no hot spot I can play them.<br /><br />As for the Freedi YouTube Downloader it will take a regular video (music, let's say 5 minutes long) about 5 seconds to download it. A movie 300 Mbs maybe 35 seconds. Short items of just 50kbs a second. Your tablet will give you a beep when the item finishes downloading. 50 regular length movies about 10-15 Gbs. My device has 32gbs but of course 5 or so is used up with the on board apps/programs. You can always uninstall any item you wish to get the space back.<br /><br />I also like to read the reviews of the app and like to see 10 to 1 ratio of 5 star vs 1 star review on apps with over 100 reviews. When you have more 1 star reviews then 5 star it's a stop sign for me. This can not be a very good app reading the reviews on here. Yes it may work for some, but the vast majority it does not work for them.

B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Fantastic book. Fantastic author.  Always a pleasure to read. I wonder if the overlords ever get there wish?  I hope they did
B004PYDBEO|5.0|Mandelbrot uses his humor and intellect to demonstrate that factual geometry can model very closely price curves.  This price curves that he can model are more accurate than the typical Brownian motion curves.  His work has the reader focused on volatility, not just price, to understand the real dynamics of a system.  This is a great book to have in your library and allows for thought provoking comments on the orthodoxy of modern finance.
B0050IY61G|5.0|This is the most comprehensive book I have read on this subject. It has an entire chapter on assisting the person with Asperger's to deal with bullies. Yes, I said person and not child, because this author even goes as far as to discuss work place bullies for adults. It has really helped this neurotypical wife and mother to better understand my Aspie husband and son.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Entertaining and engrossing. Two thumbs up. The graphics were detailed and eye catching. Intriguing puzzles too. I would definitely play it again.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Wow - what a (pleasant) surprise!  Nothing like the Stalone original which was nothing but campy fun.  This Dredd delivered an effective grim reality take on the character which was refreshing.  BTW - sound and video was excellent here.  Recommended.

B0058DRTGC|5.0|I loved good to great, and I kept asking myself, how would I implement this at my church or volunteer organization? Tada!
B00G32OER4|4.0|The standard quality left something to be desired.  I think I would have rented it on BluRay.  There was tons of artifacting in the dark scenes.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great book. And while the ending was sad, I loved it! I think it made the series what it was.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was the most disappointing ending to a trilogy ever. I struggled to even finish the book because it was so boring. I read the first two books within a week but it took me over a month to finish this and now that I have, I wish I'd never read it and instead just imagined an ending to the series that didn't totally suck.<br /><br />I didn't like the split POV and felt like it slowed down the book and there was just too much crammed into one book so nothing was really elaborated on nor were characters or their relationships further developed. I pretty much forced myself to read the ending and actually just skimmed over several chapters just so I could get to the end and say I'd finished it. I should have just stopped where I was. Now I don't think I'll even bother to go see the movies.

B001BANK32|5.0|Really? You need a rating for &#34;The Shining&#34;?  Don't watch the movie!  And if you did read the book, a million times better!
B000ICZD5M|1.0|The contrast between the genius of Frank Herbert's novel and the ineptness of this dramatization could not be overstated! There is nothing to commend this film at all. Granted I was only able to stomach the first fifty minutes, I cannot conceive of it achieving a redemption in the remaining timespan. If there was any sign of the quality changing as the film progressed, it was in the wrong direction. The lackluster special effects can be forgiven given the film's age, but what of the rest of it? Action sequences? Ludicrous in their complete lack of realism and gross overacting. Dialog? Wooden, choppy, with the screenwriter's uninspired interjections mixed awkwardly with quotes lifted from the novel. Acting? Terrible doesn't begin to describe it. At the level of a poor middle school production. Wherever your place of residence, you can be assured that your local all-volunteer community theater can deliver a performance an order of magnitude better than what you will find here.<br /><br />As for director's use of creative license, I see nothing wrong with the principle of it. It would be unreasonable to expect a long and complex novel, such as Dune, to be adapted for screen without alterations. Moreover, a story can sometimes acquire new and exciting dimensions when the storyteller is allowed to leave one's imprint on it. That said, when I see characters at the core of the story changed beyond recognition, without a commensurate addition of any value to the end product, well I just call that sloppiness compounded of presumption. In this respect, I was probably most irked by the portrayal of Lady Jessica, who appears on screen as an emotional wreck, so startlingly divergent from the depiction of Bene Gesserit in the novels.<br /><br />What else is there to say? I was about to express a hope that the mini-series, which I haven't yet seen, was better done, when I realized that anything really would be better than this. The bar is really that low.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Unbelievably depressing ending. I didn't hate the writing, just the way the series ended. Oh well, enjoyed the ride during this series but definitely won't be re-reading.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|It is a great musical and motion picture based on the true life events of the Von Trapp family at the beginning of World War II and their escape from the Nazi occupation of Austria. It has a pictorial book and personal information about the family and the movie. I would recommend it to all.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I admit I was hesitant to read this. After being assured that I would love Twilight, only to find it a poorly written series with an annoying main character, I didn't figure this would be any better, no matter what people were saying. I was happy to discover that this first book of the series is very well written with interesting and sympathetic characters. The suspense holds up well throughout the book, and I even found myself getting a little misty eyed at one point, even though I knew what was going to happen from seeing the movie.<br />I will definitely be reading the other books in the series (I never finished the Twilight series!)
1250038820|5.0|Personal glimpses into the lives of average yet not-like-I-would-have-imagined inhabitants of New York. Average photographs make it feel as if I could have been there, not some glamorous photographer with whom I have nothing in common. Really brings out the people and the stories and the normality in what appears out of the ordinary. It could be you or me or anyone we know; a great metropolis brought down to human size through the lens of an everyday guy who likes to photograph. What's not to love?
B005COO1X6|5.0|I loved it as much as you can a short story. Reminded me of &#34;The Body&#34; but really really short.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love these.  The animal provides a little weight so an infant doesn't spit it out.  Also, easy for them to find in the crib at night.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|The movie stopped near the end. I had to reboot to free it and then resume. Good movie though. END
B00CX7TOOG|5.0|First off, two great actors performed the entire film with very few others. It was edge of the seat once the background was given. I had to turn my head sometimes to avoid seeing some painful things, but that's why it's so good. I do not understand why I have not seen rave reviews on this movie, as with others that seem to go unnoticed. No romance might throw some off, but I wish there were a lot less in just about all movies. No sex, no nudity here. Just a great story performed by two amazing actors.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I can't bring myself to like where the band is going. I honestly feel that I've thrown enough money at them for their old content. Maybe they're getting a lot of new fans, but I've spent hundreds on tapes, cds, mp3s, concert tickets, and tshirts. I'm done. Good luck guys.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Got me thinking about the pain of love and how people fall in love at first sight, even if they are not compatible.
B008PZZYB2|2.0|The movie is very dumb, not really funny. We don't like it. The actor does not fit in this role.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|Movie skipped a lot.  DVD did not work well. Kept freezing and required a lot of fast forward. Ended up missing parts. Thus was frustrating
B0029O0BLS|5.0|I really like this movie and in Blu-ray it is even better it feels like I am right there & has some big stars in it so how can you go wrong..
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Love Pink, love this CD!  As always her songs are thoughtful, and empowering, and plain awesome!  I love her work.
B00C3V5TTQ|2.0|I'd probably give it 2.5 stars. It just doesn't compare to their earlier works. I've listened to it repeatedly & have tried to like it, but it just doesn't have the emotion of their earlier material. There was no song on this cd that really spoke to me about my own experience like &#34;Was it Something I Said&#34; on the Sugar Tax cd, or one that really made me empathize with others like &#34;Christine&#34; or &#34;Only Tears.&#34; It just seemed like a cd with a lower caliber of writing.<br /><br />If I didn't love the band as much as I do, I don't know if I'd be as kind, but I sincerely hope their next effort is better.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I kept my attention until the end and they lived happily ever after was just good enough for me to enjoy the finish.
B0092QITO2|5.0|Great movie.  I enjoy getting both Blu-ray & DVD disks in one package.  Use the Blu-ray disc at home and the dvd in the car for passengers.  Wish all movies came like that.
0071636080|5.0|From what I learned reading this book, I was able to make an effective 30 second presentation that got my message across to a professional audience in a creative way.

B002XD8KEU|3.0|Pleasantville is an interesting plot but doesn't really come together. It starts to drag on and frankly some parts are just weird and don't make sense.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Starts out quite well and then becomes fairly predictable with a corresponding loss of suspense. Key characters dropped/sidelined...strange that our military's fine weaponry is not really utilized in the fight. Would Navy Seals really be that unprepared??? zombies behavior molded to tidy up story versus follow through on the fine initial chaos of the film...despite all that all in all entertaining...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had a good plot to follow and more characters to get to know.  There was lots of action  to follow

B0083Z614S|5.0|I had forgotten a lot of this book. It is such a learning book. As they say, don't just a book by it's cover, or a child by their upbringing. I will continue to read this book for years to come. One of my favorite stories of all time.
0740797719|5.0|Excellent overview of lighting and color for the realist oil painter. It does what the title says. There is an overview of color theory, then considerations of how to represent various lighting conditions on various subjects, all illustrated with examples.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Really fun game with tons of variety. Will keep you coming back again and again. Tons of humor and a grounding what more could you ask for
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Sandman is all grown up, and the path just isn't as clear as it used to be.  In this modern American tale of the 21st  century,  the characters - like many of us - don't exactly know where they fit into the world.  detached from the pace of modern life, the main characters are forced to adapt quickly to radical change.  the book reads like 'reading' .  reading being  slow compared to the world around all of us.  the book brings the experience and pace of reading about the characters to life in their experiences.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Because Pearl Jam is simply the best!  The first 5 Tracks on the album are awesome.  Ten great albums. Well worth the money spent.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is a satisfying update to King's &#34;The Shining&#34; and is Classic King harkening back to the days when King was spooky but not horrible. Those whose last King book was Pet Sematary or Misery will understand what I mean. This book has me wanting to revisit the old favorites.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was the perfect third in the series book.  To put this with the others was great writing.  Can see it continuing. Or this was a great finish
B00E9O6C96|5.0|The Fiio X3 is the best choice for portable hi-fi under $1000. Read on to find out why.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with Fiio. I do not even own any of their amps. I've owned a few before, but did not find a use for them and sold/returned them.<br /><br />I base my judgement on a variety of factors:<br />- Build Quality<br />- Usability<br />- Ergonomics<br />- Sound<br /><br />I have sampled most offerings under the $1000 price range, including: Hifiman HM601, iBasso DX50, and iRiver Astell Kern AK100.<br /><br />Hands down the Fiio X3 is the best over all. Keep in mind the criteria I use. Sound is only one of the four. If the player's UI is trash, freezes a lot, and does not feel nice when using, I am unlikely to rate that player high regardless of how it sounds. This is not to say the Fiio X3 does not sound as good. It is a personal preference and I just like the combination of sound, usability, ergonomics, and build quality that the X3 offers above the rest.<br /><br />Build quality of the X3 is fantastic - comparable to the AK100. And the AK100 costs $700 while X3 is only $200. In comparison, the iBasso DX50 is plasticy, is loosely put together and squeaks when held, while the Hifiman is just a chunk of plastic fitted together with below-average Chinese production qualty. Brushed aluminum on the X3 feels nice, was solidly put together. I could find no fault to its build quality.<br /><br />Usability - beats all other DAP products except the iPods. The X3 has tactile controls for all of its functions. I love it. It is quick in response, consistent, stable, and can be operated blind i.e. in pocket, and there is hardly any accidental presses thanks to the diagonal grooves.<br /><br />In comparison, the AK100 and DX50 are crap. Terrible touch UI, unresponsive touches, touches being misinterpreted at all times, and tons of accidental/unintentional touches. Maybe I am being harsh, but Apple has got it right for FIVE years, and yet neither iRiver or iBasso was able to offer anything with a resemblance of a usable UI. Fiio probably can't either - that is why they didn't even bother with touch, and just made it all physical. Brilliant.<br /><br />Hifiman, on the other hand, has bad physical buttons. You have to press hard, and it squeaks, and the whole unit twists and screams in painful plastic pain while you try to skip songs or navigate menus.<br /><br />Ergonomics - love the bar shape. It is thin and narrow enough to fit comfortably. In comparison, the rest all suck - the AK100 has wide, fat shape with pointy, cold metal corners that just cut into your hands; The DX50 has giant ugly buttons that aren't any easier to access, press or more responsive than the small buttons on the X3. The Hifiman...I don't even want to mention it.<br /><br />What I am looking for in this category, is I want something that I am comfortable holding, click on some controls really quick, and slid it into my pocket. So far only the X3 satisfies.<br /><br />Sound. This is the hardest area to review, which is why I left it last. The sound that the X3 offers is not as distinct as the others. This is why I like it best - it is jack of all trades, balanced, and is a step up from mainstream portable DAPs like iPhones, Sonys, Sandisks, and the such.<br /><br />That is all I want from a portable hi-fi player - portable, easy to use, consistent and trust worthy, cheap, sounds good, and has expandable storage. I don't really care about having different line out functions, or doubling as a DAC, or can be bundled with another source with rubber band, velcro, and extra cables. So I have not taken these into account. What I can say is that I use the line-out (not the headphone out) on my X3 in my car, and it totally improves the sound of my car's stereo from crappy to sounding really good.<br /><br />If you have $1000 to spend, maybe you can get the HM901, or the new Sony hifi player soon to be released. But if you think your needs and wants aresimilar to mine, get the Fiio X3 (or wait for the X5) and just ignore the competition, because they don't really compete with the X3 at all.<br /><br />P.S. Astell&Kern sucks do not ever buy them. You might as well give the money to homeless to buy crack.similar to mine, get the Fiio X3 (or wait for the X5) and just ignore the competition, because they don't really compete with the X3 at all.<br /><br />P.S.

B00FG1Q5J8|3.0|Don't get me wrong I enjoy the game very much, I just would like better options, First it gives the appearance of being  able to choose what happens....in the end it all leads to the same.

I am fine  with the options leading to the same scenario...but just more options...it's killing me haha

B00GD9F59S|5.0|This review will make a little more sense if I set up the scene for you ... I have been anticipating this book for months. After the way the series was heading I knew Armentrout would have me by the short-hairs with this book from start to finish. So the day after the release I find myself on an airplane, traveling for work, so I save it for the flight. I am not a nervous traveler by any means but I knew no matter what was going on, or what I was flying into (work wise, it was not a fun trip) that this at least would be able to hold my attention and distract me.<br /><br />So, there I was on my flight, attempting, not all that successfully, to not bawl my eyes out. Pretty much from the start. I've never been on &#34;Team Seth&#34; but after everything that happens in this book, I am certainly now on &#34;Team Seth deserves his own happy ending&#34; - which when I saw he is getting his own spin off series, just about made my life. But my main focus, as it has been since the beginning, is on Alex, and her relationship with Aiden.<br /><br />Oh Aiden ... you are perfect. And you don't even realize it. The things you have had to go through and still have to go through to be with Alex, well, let's just say no one will ever doubt your commitment to her. I mean ... nope. Not going to ruin anything. I will however say it is one of the most epic romances to grace the mythologies.<br /><br />I might have just been PMS'ing, but Sentinel had me riding an emotional roller coaster to rival all other coasters, and the big stomach dropping hill was near the end. I thought I was going to die. At one point I just sat there, staring at the words, and even flipped back a few pages to re-read that particular section wondering if indeed, that just happened. It had. I was not hallucinating and even now, just thinking about THAT PART I tear up a little.<br /><br />This is a great finale to a wonderful YA series. A good book leaves you satisfied, a great book leaves you satisfied, but still wanting a little more, and sometimes wondering how the characters are doing after the end of the story. Like, what are they doing now? How have they handled the news about ... ? Do they all know about ... ?wanting a little more, and sometimes wondering how the characters are doing after the end of the story. Like, what are they doing now?

0802473156|3.0|This is a great book to explain the different types of love languages. It's important to know how you love and how you want to be loved. It's a great discussion book for you and your partner. It is written a bit simply and I passed over a lot of the examples as I found they dragged out. However, the basic content is all you need.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book. Better than the movie. A mix of reality with fantasy helps the reader create realistic images and makes you think what if it isn't fake.
B00CTGVKGQ|4.0|Another Hit.  The Love Club is similar to  lORDE,  It has a nice fresh harmonic sound, and good lyrics.<br />Good Work
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|Bedroom Games is another exciting read from Charity Parkerson and with the combined efforts of Regina Puckett you have a short story that is AWESOME!<br /><br />This is a real page turner that I read this afternoon. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Its a gripping story of fear and sexual games that climax to a thrilling end.<br /><br />The writing in this book flowed smoothly and is sometimes witty... when you aren't thinking about the noises coming from upstairs.  Smartly written, I enjoyed every bit of this book. A great combination of fear and sex. Keep your bat at the ready because you will be stimulated and scared at the same time and with a creep factor. Excellent job ladies!<br /><br />I am giving this my 5 star rating for a wonderful collaboration of two brilliant writers. Can't wait for more!
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|OMG!!! Are you kidding me? I cannot believe they actually paid to make this utterly ridicules movie! I mean really! If you're going to make a movie about zombies at least make it worth watching! The only thing worth watching was Brad Pitt!!!!
B000MG1YC0|5.0|One of my favorite metal bands and I think this particular album stands out as their best from an already impressive and grand collection. The instrumentation is great and the lyrics are beautiful. This album feels a bit softer than their other works but I think it is still a hit. If you are looking to get someone interested in Sirenia, then this is the album I recommend you ask them to hear. Amazon offers a decent price for the albums as well, nothing terribly expensive, which helps especially if you are looking to get the rest of the Sirenia collection.
B00006AW63|1.0|This DVD will NOT play in a DVD player made in the US.  They are not compatible.  Do not buy this if you live in the US.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great to find out what happened to Danny Torrance!  Deals openly and honestly with addiction.  A great story.  You'll never look at the old folks in Winnebagos the same again...
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Story line could be told in 20 seconds.  Needless violence; while some is acceptable, why repeats of battles where nothing is different?  why not spend the time developing the characters and some actual plot???  the movie could have been about 50 minutes shorter, without losing anything, and maybe gaining in the process.  then it would have rated a 3, maybe.
0525478817|3.0|I was really expecting to be moved by the characters, moved by the plot, etc. This book fell a little flat for me. I'm in my late teens, and I almost feel that this book is marketed to a specific subset of the young adult/teen group: those who can relate to fairly static, and slightly annoying teenage characters. It's a pretty simple read, so I would recommend everyone read the novel to form their own opinion of it. I give the book 3/5 stars.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The story captured me from the first page. I felt the character development was believable. The author wove in a bit of magic realism to give a find ending to a senior &#34;coming of age&#34; story to a couple who had suffered significant loss.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was fantastic. I read the other 2 and fell in love with the characters. The book just has a great storyline and a good amount of details. Totally worth the reading!
B002Q9MZHE|5.0|Excellent singing and acting.  Anna Netrebko is superb.  Movie version  of opera is very real.  An excellent DVD to own.
B008602KQI|2.0|The movie just didn't do anything for me.  It was like I was expecting something to happen and nothing did.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I should have read the reviews. Seeing &#34;preachy&#34; used again and again by reviewers would have been helpful before I bought this. A simple read with overly simple sentences, no character development, and a poor concept. Abandoned this book halfway through as I did not want to waste any more time on it.
1451695195|2.0|Was a well written book by a very intelligent man. The book tittle &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; really brought me to buy this tittle for a realization of proof. While reading the text, it came across very clear and was well written and projected. Through the reading I found that it's only fault was that I did not see ( the proof of heaven). It is very clear that what happened in this doctor's life is truly amazing and a story to tell, but it did not answer the questions or lock a guarantee that the world encountered was a proof of heaven.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I love the Grisham books and was thrilled to read he was coming back to Jake Brigance as a character. I didn't expect it to reach the expectations of &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; and it came close but I didn't care for the in-depth information about the duties of the lawyer. I much preferred the actual story and the emotion feelings behind the characters.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Fabulous series. Couldn't stop watching. Each character brings so much to show. Love them all. Each week new and interesting plot line. Never boring always amazing

For crying out loud, give us a tiny game to solve before we can get 500 coins or something else.  But having to PAY to play after I paid BIG FISH GAMES to play on their site; that's a rip-off.  (Big Fish Games has a slot game in this app.)<br />Nice games.  Fleecing the public.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is written so well and the actors are perfect, the chemistry between Harvey and Mike is great, so fun to watch very funny! I love this show it remains one of my favorite.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book!  The plot was not as complex as the first novel which I was happy about.  Parts seemed unneeded but overall a great novel.
B005544V6A|5.0|I loved this season. Couldn't get enough of Suits. Sophisticated, edgy, intriguing, fast moving, incredible actors and writers, best wardrobes
B00881VLCE|2.0|Just doesn't work very well - I play other puzzle apps & they're a lot smoother and a lot more versatile
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game. I just really hate it when i have to stop and wait to play again. Then i get more lives and i am off and running again. Lol. I have waited a long time to play this on my kindle fire. It was worth the wait. Just sorry i had to.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great attorney show if you like court cases and scandals. Great plots and sub plots, cast is outstanding guest star judges
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Didn't like this one as well as the first two but was still a great read.  Wish the author was still alive to write more.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I liked the other two much more, It missed something and felt repetitive :/ still a good book but wish it had ended better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great hours of pleasure &amp; fun. Awesomest game ever!!! If you haven't tried Candy Crush you are most definitely missing out. Give it a try you will not regret!!
B003FO61KG|5.0|Yuja Wang is one of the greatest pianists alive. Enough said. The disk is marvelous, her playing angelic. Buy it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Absolutely love this game even game, it's a good job energy runs out or I'd never get anything done. Highly recommend it.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|If you can relate to this character you will love this film, if you can't this may be the worst film ever. I think people who watch and relate to the character will be very frustrated, and hurt on a very cathartic level. There is so much depth put Into each shot of the film, I've must have seen the film 20 times and still find new things in it. DeNiro put so much heart and soul into his method acting you will feel so many emotions coming from his character. Watching all the extras and listening to the commentaries adds a new dimension to everything about the film. There's so many layers and aspects to the film it's hard to even know where to begin. The bluray looks amazing.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is such a great series already and I am only on the third book. Must read it for sure
B005C5QS9A|5.0|I'm a yoga teacher and this is an excellent and impressively comprehensive book. Unfortunately, the author occassionally casts a negative light on enthusiastic students and seems to be a bit star struck -- I don't like that.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Welcome back, Dr. Scarpetta! 'Dust' is an instant classic, with all the elements we learned to love over the years and without any of the experiments in style or storytelling.<br />The plot is thick, the emotions raw, Cornwell at her best!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For a free game this is very well made. It is always being updated with fun costumes for the minion etc. My only complaint is that I can't change the skill level. My younger sibling always wants to play but it's too hard. Other than that, no complaints! Really great app :)
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is my favorite TV show. I love everything that happens in this show. I'm glad with amazon prime I get to go back and watch all season's because I missed the first few seasons when they were shown.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent story and book.  Held interest during long trip to and from Asia.  Definitely recommend for yourself or as a gift for someone else.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game. Very entertaining. Lots of levels and lots of fun. Don't have to pay to get to next level.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great law story...a sequel to A Time to Kill.  Jake is back with his passion for the law.  It's about contested wills and you'll learn some new approaches.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like it. just started playing. good graphics. nice gun upgrades. would like to see more player movement.  walking around.
B00ERH15WY|5.0|Since seeing Bad Religion at a KROQ Acoustic Christmas show in 1993 and hearing them plow through holiday standards, I've been waiting and hoping for this release. My only regret is that it's not a full album, and so short. An agnostic myself, including &#34;American Jesus&#34; pushes at the limits of my comfort level, but at least it's sincere, given Bad Religion's consistent philosophy and history. Perhaps most impressive is that all these years later, the band still sounds as fresh, inspired and intense as it did 30 years ago, even when playing songs we've all heard too many times to count (and they've no doubt played enough times to just mail them in). That they're donating proceeds from the release to victims of priest abuse only proves its sincerity and adds to the intrigue. Highly recommended—and lots of fun to boot.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This season was even better than the first season which was also awesome. Jessica Lange was fantastic together with the rest of the cast. The story unbelievable yet your captivated and can't wait for each new show. Ending unexpected but worth it the to wrap the season up.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I love the picture but that's about all that this app has going for it for me, I cannot comment about the other functions because I cannot use them, it is so glitchy I cannot even tell if I can like videos or comment, every time I minimize the video and scroll down the page goes black and I have to scroll back up to the video for it to return to normal. Also every so often when I maximize the video and play it again the advertisements keep flashing on and off the screen making me have to reload the page.<br /><br />I would also like to be able to browse my subscriptions' playlists to find videos from the past instead of having to scroll or search in the search bar.<br /><br />So far that is it, I would love to see fixes at least before I buy pro.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Very good movie based on the Jack Reacher books.  I had my doubts because Tom Cruise is not physically anything like Jack.  I also haven't liked his latest movies.  But they pull it off and it's fun to watch.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was a great read, I got much more from it than the life story of Tesla. My favorite thought that I will take with me for the rest of my life: losing something only hurts you if you can't imagine recreating it or achieving something even better.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I didn't expect to love this book as much as I did.  When I finished it, I rushed to get the next one in the series but it wasn't out yet!  I yelled loudly!  How in the world could I wait to see what happens next?!?!<br /><br />This book is so unique.  It has a dystopian setting combined with steampunk elements and a fairy tale retelling.  A lot going on but it works so well.  This is a futuristic world where there are Earthlings and Lunar people and if you leg doesn't work, you can just replace it with a robotic one.  But, of course, future Earth isn't a paradise.  Humans are still humans after all, with prejudices and failures.<br /><br />The main character, Cinder, is a cyborg mechanic living as a slave to her stepmother and stepsisters, considered less than human because of her robotic parts.  She is working in her shop when Prince Kai comes along and the two strike up a friendship--with sparks!<br /><br />Naturally, there is danger, intrigue, and romance, more than rival Disney's retelling of the classic tale.  The character of Cinder is captivating and, even though you know the fairy tale twists, you will find yourself crying out at the unfairness of it all.<br /><br />This was definitely one of my favorite reads of the year.  There were surprises at every turn.  I loved that Cinder was a cyborg, and yet she was so approachable and real.  I could see myself totally hanging out with her.  This plot line is a cliff-hanger and this is NOT a story that comes close to ending on the last page.  Once you start this series, you'll have to finish it.  This is a great way to introduce those dated fairy tales to our modern techno-readers.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I think that this game is a well made MOBA and it will offer entertainment for a certain amount of time, it does not have many new interesting gameplay after you get used to the normal modes, but the use of friends and guilds do make the game fun.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The app is perfect to see how much battery is left. It indicates for different functions, too. (Llistening, reading, recording, etc)
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Glad I found this book. Set in North Korea, with  a plot that keeps you guessing. If you are in the mood for a new kind of story, read this!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loved it. It had all of my favorite things extreme stuff like  lasers and technology<br />to make it cooler.
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|I like this game, it's fun to play and the concept is interesting  but it has crashed on my Nexus 7 several times
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love this book and I love this site it global and reassemble l think that it is a good thing.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|Love the app for meetings.  It's great to have a back up of the notes I am writing.  Easy to use
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Loved reading ERBs stories as a kid. The Martian series had you wishing to meet the princess and her enemies. Still have all ERBs books (only 1 on 2 missing) from all he had written. The Martian, Venusian and Inner World Series were full of adventure.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|This book was extremely good. I couldn't stop reading. It's such a wonderful love story!! Get it and you will love it!
B0012EJVTY|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for music since it is such a personal thing. One man's Mozart is another man's chalk board fingernails! However Made in Japan is an album that takes my back to my younger years and I will always love it. Deep Purple knew how to rock it and this is still one of the best live albums ever recorded. If you are my age and happen to stumble across this album go ahead and buy it. If you loved it back then you love it all over again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really good. When I first got this I was amazed and couldn't stop playing. I recommend this game to everyone!
0618918248|5.0|Its the first book and only book of Dawkins that I have read.  It took me a while to get into it.  Many valid arguments were presented.  Some of his own and some from others.  He mentioned a story about a priest when he was a child but he didn't elaborate.  Why tease us?  Overall, this book will help you accept reality.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Excellent portrayal of the blue planet and its denizens. Looking forward to viewing Part two 3 years from now, then 4 a year after that.
B00G32OER4|1.0|Allow me to conjure up a review. Lame dead dog at 20 mins in (no, we never saw that coming...). Hey, I give cool lectures and me and my wife, we make a livinging bilkinig people out of their cool stuff. New house, no flashlights, no problems. Holy crap, something went \\"bump.\\" Time to call the para-hobbyists because no one else has adequately conned  this naive family yet. So on and so forth, blah, blah, blah. \\"True story!\\" \\"It could happen to YOU!\\"<br /><br />No, it won't, because all of this is a bunch of Hollywood non-sense. Yeah, I love how many \\"true stories\\" have a sequel (yep, this one has one coming out soon).<br /><br />What makes people thing this crap is even remotely scary? Just another boring slog in a long line of wannabe horror films. Some day someone will get this formula right.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A very good read. Could not give 5 stars because some parts seemed to be too bogged down with details and I found myself skimming over some of the days in court.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Free. Fun. Addictive. Plus beautifully detailed graphics and dozens of missions to keep you interested, what more could you ask for?
B00DXP7L88|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed the entire Dexter Series.  At times, the plot in earlier seasons tended to drag a bit but they always came together to keep my interest.  The reviews on this Final Season however,  tended to be so negative as I first read them on Amazon, that I actually questioned purchasing this Final Season.  From the negatives which were written, it seemed that this Final Season must be a horrible letdown.  LUCKILY, I ignored those reviews as impossible to believe--, and I was right.<br /><br />The Final Season is EXCELLENT.  Without revealing any of the plot, I wish to state that the plot is &#34;SOLID&#34;!  I do not wish to go into the details but would encourage anyone who has enjoyed Dexter, to watch and you should thoroughly enjoy this final season.  Remember the series has to end.  This ending was very good.<br /><br />Debra's situation as it develops, Dexter's problems & loves, the Dr. and and their relationship in his developing life, as well as all the other twists in this season are well done. These and other plot scenarios all work their way in a very acceptable manner throughout the 12 episodes.  We are dealing with a very complex character with extremely complicated relationships that are well handled.  I see no loose ends that need tying up, as this &#34;VERY WELL DONE&#34; Final Season ends.<br /><br />This Final Season was fast moving in such a way that it constantly kept my interest and attention.  It was sad and sweet and horrible and satisfying and suspenseful and probably not perfect - - , but VERY GOOD !<br /><br />The final NW Camp scene is probably not needed, but certainly not a bad inclusion.  The future still is open to all kinds of possibilities, even a Dexter Movie.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|One of the handful of comedies which remain funny no matter how many times you watch it.  Not only that, but it would be worth watching just for the music, even if it weren't so funny.
1449305172|5.0|This books seems to me like the logical sequel to the seminal book by Eric Ries.<br /><br />What I liked most is that it goes right to the nitty-gritty of finding a business model that works. To be more exact, you can even find scripts to interview customers or write emails to them.<br /><br />When I co-founded a startup I was full of unanswered questions: how good are we doing? what stage are we at? how should we price our product? what's the next step? is this business plan of any use? should I raise VC money?<br /><br />Running lean gets answers to most of those questions, because it:<br /><br />- Encourages you to talk to customers<br />- States that running a startup is a matter of managing risks, and risks also determine your priorities<br />- Defines a set of stages that startups must go through (problem/solution, product/market, scale)<br />- Defines an alternative way to document business models (\\"lean canvas\\", as opposed to business plans) with the goal of making it dynamic, understandable, and accesible<br />- Encourages you to stay focused and push less features<br />- Gives miscellaneous advice<br /><br />I'd say that the value of this book is 1000x its price plus the time needed to read it.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|it's the best movie ever, hilarious,  heartwarming and wholesome. I would recommend it to anyone with a heart regardless of age.
B004ADH1RI|2.0|Getting old I reckon because this kind of movies with kids acting like nuts does not light my candle.  I could not watch all of this movie because it was s booing.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is by far the funniest show I've watched in my lifetime, and I'm 32 lol. Hopefully it goes on forever.
B008JFURII|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4 .2 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />although not as great as the first one, still and enjoyable action / comedy movie.<br />recommended
B00CMKPNBC|5.0|Zaz brings back more high energy goodness in a yet more mature album.  This whole album makes me feel extremely joyful.
1594487154|5.0|9 out of 10 of us are selling; even my dental hygenist who tries every 4 months to get me to floss.  So, if we are to be successful, we have to learn how better influence people.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Fantastic movies that works both for the kids and for the adults.  The story line had interesting twists and was not your standard formulaic fare.  We've watched it too many times to count.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very interesting story about  different characters and human nature, fate and mistakes people make during their lives. I really enjoyed it
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Pay to play?  No way! Deleted it.  I don't think these games are meant for people who aren't going to fall for their schemes of making money.
B00377E5R2|5.0|Excellent Movie.  Much like American President, You've got mail, Sleeping in Seattle, etc.  You can watch them again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's like having your own horse I have a horse though but have fun<br />And like be cool and relax plz
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This book gives more background on King and Maxwell's journey into the P.I. business. The story was a bit drawn out but very involved.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've had hours of fun playing. The ads do pop up at the start of each game, but what does one expect for free. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars, the game has locked up twice on me and I've had to uninstall and re-install it both times. That means I lost credit for my high scores.  Otherwise, great fun!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Highly recommended  It's just one of the best games I have played on the kindle. Hands down most addictive game yet.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved that the main characters had depth and soul, and you can really connect and like them. I enjoyed this book so much.This is the first book by Jojo Moyes that I'd read but as soon as I finished it, I downloaded The Girl You Left Behind as well as it's prequel. I won't spoil the book for you, but if you enjoy emotional, gut wrenching books this is perfect for you.
