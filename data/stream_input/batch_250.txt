B0000399WI|5.0|Never before have I seen a movie that is so profoundly human. The Shawshank Redemption is not just about people in prison but about people in general. It is a celebration of the human spirit and that great thing that we have called hope.<br />Do yourselves a favour and watch this movie. Let it inspire you; let it make you laugh; let it make you cry; and most importantly let it help you fathom the power of hope.<br />If this movie does not make you feel something special inside then I don't know what will.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Okay, I'm not going to go over all of the excellent points made in all the previous reviews I've read of this absolutely INCREDIBLE piece of art. But I will note a few minor differences of opinion, and give my overall impression.<br />First the latter ... when I first saw that YES was touring with an orchestra, I immeadiately dis-missed it. I had bought &quot;Symphonic Music of Yes&quot; a few months back &amp; while it was nice, I wasn't terribly impressed. So I took a pass when a friend asked me to see the show, which caused him to not go as well. <br />Flash ahead a few months &amp; the DVD's release. I picked it up, hoping for an improvement over the &quot;House Of Yes&quot; which I also own. And from the first strains of &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; it is clear I was getting all that and more. It is, without a doubt, the best Concert DVD I have yet seen - both visually &amp; musically. The picture s so clear, you'll swear you're there on stage. And the sound is so much an improvement over their previous DVD releases, it's like comparing a CD to a gramaphone. It is THAT startling. Add to that, the incredible set list, and the orchestra, and this is THE DVD to see for YES fans, both casual &amp; hardcore.<br />Now then, where I tend to disagree with the other reviwewers here. First - Tom Brislin. I'll be the first to admit that I am a HUGE Wakeman fan, and I might be overly rough on other keyoard players because of that, but he HACKED the solos on &quot;Close to the Edge.&quot; And seeing as that was the FIRST SONG of the show, I was soured on him from that point on. Luckily, the orchestra filled in enough throughout that it was mostly a non-issue. And I'll admit, he did a better job than Igor did on &quot;House of Yes,&quot;<BR>but that's it. Second - I LIKED the new material, especially &quot;Don't Go.&quot; Is it as good as their early stuff ? No. But that doesn't make it BAD.<br />One final note, and a somewhat politically in-correct one. I have never beforeseen an Orchestra with THAT MANY attractive women ! I certainly don't remember ANY of the girls in my High Scool Symphony looking like that.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is a classic. He is the ultimate underdog in all of us. What is amazing to me is that here is a character, the main character, who delivers such emotion and reality into his head and heart and he never speaks a word.<br />The Disney animators were brilliant in storyboarding and animating all these characters in the setting of a traveling circus. Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo (Dumbo's mother) were persecuted because he was different. Being different was scorned and teased and tortured at this circus. What was different about Dumbo? He had overly large ears.<br />Thanks to one friend, a small mouse, with the spirit and attitude of a major general, Dumbo learns his value, his importance to his mother and what it means to have a true friend. This movie was very special. It has heart and feeling and the most emotive Disney animated character ever that actually never says a word.<br />The DVD extras on this release are one of the best of the Disney series; it includes a retrospective history of the making and the design of the film with some of the original artists and Roy Disney himself. There are two sing-a-longs for the kids and even two very cute shorts that were originally produced before Dumbo. One was actually the `blueprint' for what Dumbo eventually came to be. There is also a music video with Michael Crawford singing Baby Be Mine.<br />This is a great DVD to have in anyone's Disney collection or animation collection overall.  8-6-02
B000069HKH|5.0|Springsteen's latest album, \\"The Rising\\" was all that I'd hoped for. As expected, the boss has already topped the covers of such magazines as \\"Time\\" and \\"Rolling Stone.\\" In an interview earlier this year, Bruce had commented on the upcoming album, saying that it was unlike his previous albums and that he couldn't wait for fans to hear the new music. Upon first hearing \\"The Rising\\" I understood exactly what he meant. The style is different and new, but developed. A few things that I've noticed is his new approach at repeating many of the same lines that are not part of the chorus. For example, \\"waiting for a shout from the crowd\\" and \\"turn it up\\" on the track \\"Mary's Place\\" and \\"rise up\\" and \\"with these hands\\" on the track \\"My City of Ruins.\\" I immediately liked this change in his songwriting and think that it helped greatly in making each song come across as he hoped it would. Here is a brief review of each song:<BR>Lonesome Day - A great song that will distil any worries that the boss has lost any of his musical talent that so impressed us on the \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" album.<BR>Into the Fire - For me, this song gets gradually better each time you listen to it<BR>Waitin on A Sunny Day - Just a happy-go-lucky song that is fun to listen to<BR>Nothing Man - The first few lines will hook you and drag you in. Springsteen's voice is captivating and strong. The second of two wonderful slow songs on this album.<BR>Countin on a Miracle - For those of you who are fans of Springsteen's high-energy full blown rock songs, (such as I) this track will be one of your favorites.<BR>Empty Sky - This song also sounded better to me after hearing it a few times. The lyrics in this song are tremendously potent, \\"i want an eye for an eye.\\" This track will undoubtedly bring you back to the events of 9-11.<BR>World's Apart- A work of genius. Touched with a unique middle eastern flavor at the beginning and very end of the song, it might surprise you the first time you hear it. It begins slow,with the calming \\"la la la la la\\" and then hitting a loud beat and bursting with emotion and the most fascinating lyrics of any song on the album.<BR>Let's Be Friends - Loved it immediately. You will not be able to shake the catchy chorus from your mind, \\"don't know when this chance might come again, good times got a way of commin to an end\\"<BR>Further on up the Road - Hearing this song will take you back to the \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" album, with the haunting lyrics and amazing beat.<BR>The Fuse - The first of two songs I was not too impressed with, but by no means a bad song<BR>Mary's Place - A terrific song! The repetitive lyrics are key to this songs greatness -<BR>You're Missing - The second not to great a song, but still worth the listen<BR>The Rising - The obvious gem of the album!! The energy is amazing as are the lyrics and \\"na na na na\\" do a great service to the song<BR>Paradise - The greatest slow song on the album. Springsteen's voice hear is nothing short of divine. The carefully chosen lyrics and hush of the soft music will make you hold your breath as you listen for the next words<BR>My City of Ruins - A song of faith, the last step required to complete the 'rising.' You will not be dissapointed.
B00003CXQY|4.0|The Emperor's New Groove is a fun frolic of wit and humor. This film relies mainly on the quick verbiage and dialogue to get some really interesting humor. David Spade plays the Emperor Kusko and John Goodman plays Pacha - the man he befriends in order to get back home.<br />Get back home you say? Kusko is transformed into a llama thanks to his ever-evil advisor Isma. (Played brilliantly by the voice talents of Ertha Kitt. With her sidekick - Kronk, Isma turns Kusko into a llama - by accident. Her intent was to originally kill him by its Kronk who makes the wrong choice.<br />The story then moves in two directions, Pacha, who learns that Kusko wants to destroy his village must convince the Emperor that this is the wrong thing to do to his people and a Kusko must get home and try and become human again thinking Isma is on his side. Later Kusko learns Isma wants to kill him and therefore the race to the secret laboratory is on.<br />The visuals are fun and interesting and the colors are very pastel like and everything has a hard edge to them. Not like the other rounder Disney films have been.<br />The DVD Extras are the best I have ever seen. There is a complete walk through with the Producer and Director from everything from concept to theatrical release. They have script-to-screen comparisons, music supervision section - complete with Sting as well as the interviews with cast, crew and artists. There are many hours of viewing on this DVD. Also the CD-Rom features are very good. Great for kids and adults alike. I liked this movie in the theatre and I love the DVD even more! You will too! 8-6-02
B00005JKZT|5.0|This is just for the trailer, it looks amazing, and lets leave it at that. As for the guy that says gollum will look...  cause it's completely CGI'd, well, good news my friend, Gollum is actually a guy in one of those motion capture suits, then is in a gollum suit later on, and they just kind of CGI around him.<BR>And to make it even better they actually have the guy doing Gollums voice in the suit so there won't be any...  voice dubbing. Hoorah...hey, what's the deal with the word \\"won't\\"?, isn't it a dimmed down word for will not?....wouldn't it be win't?...I give the word \\"won't\\" 1 outta 5 stars
B000067CPX|5.0|when i first heard this album, i disliked it. but after listening to it again &amp; again, it really starts to grow on you! this album is different from anything the chili peppers have realesed earlier in their careers. I own all but one of RHCP's albums, and i got to say that i like &quot;Buy The Way&quot; as much as &quot;Californication&quot;, if not more. Tracks such as 'By The Way', 'Can't Stop', 'The Zephyr Song', 'Dosed', 'This Is The Place', 'Midnight' and 'Venice Queen' are definate standouts. The funky riff in &quot;Can't Stop&quot; sounds great and Flea's bass skills are still awesome. &quot;On Mercury&quot; is a 'skaish' type song and sounds quite. 'Cabron' is great fun to listen to, and takes a spanish approach (Guitar Capo 7). All in all, I really enjoy listening to this CD, and I recommend it to any rock music fan.
0380820846|5.0|I consider myself an avid romance reader.   I would forget chores and homework to read a book.  Now, I have read plenty books that could be considered Ok, bad, and a &quot;you could not put this book down if your life depended upon it.&quot;  This book was definately in the latter category.  I felt such a bond with Penelope.  How many of us out there aren't beautiful, aren't popular, but have a wonderful sense of humor, and an intelligent mind?  I would definately call myself a wallflower(you'll have to read the book to understand).  Colin is the typical boy next door that grows up while away, and comes home only to realize that his life could not be complete without the girl next door.  He's charming, funny, and just about perfect.  He's not these other men, who constantly contradict what he's feeling.  He knows what he's feeling and will admit it scares, delights, or absolutely frightens him.  I don't think anyone could have been a more perfect match for him than Penelope, or Colin for her.  Lady Whistledown, of course, adds delightful wit and humor to the Bridgerton books, and I love who she turns out to be in the end.  I could not have picked a better person.  Reading the other Bridgerton books you think you have an idea who it might be, but no no no.  I read this book in 2 1/2 hours.  I literally could not put it down.  Thank you Julia Quinn.  I can't wait to see what has happened to Eleanor.
0783225792|2.0|This movie had its strong points, but at its core, it can't escape the fate of being a rehash or Scorsesees other pictures. Here, too, he tries to mix the often bizarre juxtapositions of criminal and family life (the FBI agents who run out of gas on DeNiro's golf course, Joe Pesci making his son breakfast after a night of busting heads) with an in-depth, almost textbook examination of organized crime. Pesci and DeNiro are in Scorsesee mode, playing variations of their usual roles. Sharon Stone actually can act, which suprised me, but her role here may be one of the best (and one of the more compelling parts of the film) in the way she acts as a catalyst. It's interesting that DeNiro's Ace makes their marriage a business arrangement. The way she gets between the two leading men is intriguing (especially in the scene where she asks Pesci to kill DeNiro-Pesci's reaction is priceless). <br />Unfortunately too much of this is on autopilot for the director. I mean, how many times can I watch Joe Pesci beat someone up while the Rolling Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\" plays on the soundtrack? (C'mon, you even used the same SONGS from Goodfellas?) The rather contrived scene in which Pesci beats a guy up for cursing out DeNiro (\\"is that your pen?\\")echos the scene in Goodfellas where he kills the \\"made\\" guy too much. Some of the mechanics of the Casino are interesting, but on the whole this movie seems unecessary, and you can feel it in some parts in which the director tries for something new (the way Scorsesee switches the narration even to characters who have minor roles is an odd choice, which does little for the film) and doesn't quite pull it off.<br />The movie bogs down in it's epic length. The ending is also somewhat anti-climactic, and even the last shot echos Goodfellas.<br />What's interesting is that after this Scorsessee reteamed with another writing partner (Paul Schrader) and made another      quasi rip-off of one of his classic films (Taxi Driver), \\"Brining out the Dead\\". That movie, however, is more interesting and goes a different course than its predecessor than this one.
0790734060|1.0|I saw Amadeus at the Cambridge Film festival. I was told it was the story of Mozart's life, was critically acclaimed and the pinnacle of the festival. How much was I disappointed, often irritated and by the end I felt thoroughly used and exploited by what I can only describe as a terrible, terrible film. But why? Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious. Instead Amadeus chose to focus on how irritating Mozart the man was, and featured a few uninspiring scenes demonstrating his genius in composition. Good Will Hunting managed to make maths exciting, but Amadeus was given the most moving medium of all, Music, by one of the most incredible musicians who ever lived, and they made it more boring than dry paint that's been dry for a very long time. <br />For such a critically acclaimed film I was expecting certain things. First was good music, but this was a taken. It was about Mozart, of course the music was good, it was Mozart. All they needed was Mozart's greatest hits playing in the background to be good! So I give it 0 points for the score, you want good classical music then buy the CD.  I would say that Fahrid Murray Abraham was very good as the narrator and main character, putting in solid performance. As far as the other acting is concerned the mixture of accents from Shakespearean English to Italian, German and inevitably American never related to the actual nationality of the character was enough for me to hate every performance, if I hear Elizabeth Berridge say Volfey in a German\American accent once more I consider suing for mental aggravation.<br />You want good classical music with a complex story and impressive cinematography then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey. If you want the story of a flawed but fantastic composer then get Shine out on video, you wont be disappointed. If you prefer your musical period drama documentaries full of irritating actors, pretty costumes, tedious storylines and bits of opera then do watch this, and if you would prefer to while away your time for three mind numbingly boring hours then check out the directors cut. Amadeus, you owe me £5 and three hours of my life, I wont forgive you until I get them back.
B00005JKED|5.0|The story is great, the acting is great, the action is great, and it is all around a very entertaining movie.  Denzel is a proven actor, and this movie is worth every penny, it is one of the few movies in my collection that i can pop in at any time and be entertained.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Lets be honest this film was never going to win any votes for an Oscar or an Emy but I think it would win votes from fans of Thriller/Horror movies and also fans of the Games. For those of you who are sitting there going Resident What? And Umbrella Who? Here is a quick run down of the plot.<BR>Imagine a Small American Midwestern Town called Racoon City (Don't ask), its economy is good, its people are happy and enjoy living there and it has some fantastic scenery. The largest employer in the city is the Umbrella Corporation, Americas largest Medical group. Umbrella looks clean, however it also produces large orders of Biological weapons. Umbrella decided to build a secret lab called the HIVE, under Racoon City (How they did it with out anybody knowing, your guess is as good as mine), this lab is there to research the T-Virus, a medical triumph in the field of combating nerve based disease. However the Virus has an interesting side effect; it can bring people back from the dead and also turn people into the undead (NICE). <BR>Anyhow a disgruntled employee breaks a vile of the T-Virus in the HIVE in an attempt to kill everyone, he rushes for the exit while the HIVES Megalomaniac Super Computer, the RED QUEEN, (one of the directors many associations with the Alice and in Wonderland Story) seals off the HIVE in an attempt to contain the outbreak, of course all of the employees quickly die and soon the HIVE is full of hordes of Zombies all looking for a quick snack.<BR>Umbrella sends in the Marines to find out what went wrong and with the help of the security guard Alice (Reference), Jovovich, they soon find themselves battling the undead, shooting mutant dogs, avoiding laser beams all while trying to restore Alice's memory and find an antidote.<BR>Queue lots of blood flying around rooms, screaming, boo scares, creatures galore and the typical statement of never go down a corridor alone especially a dark one. <BR>The film moves along nicely and does not take its self tooseriously at all, it is not afraid to show that it has borrowed form the Night, Dawn and Day of the dead series by Romero and it is because of this admittance that it works well.<BR>The actors perform well and interact well also with the Computer FX. The Zombies do look disgusting and they are all different and they actually move like Zombies in the game and not like a stereotypical Zombie of On the Zombie FX a few points that should be worth noting are that the Zombie scenes are NOT computer generated they are actual actors, a hark back to the days of when computers where more costly than the film and the FX department only dreamed of virtual actors. The computer FX, also the make up teams were told to make the zombies look ill not dead and this is evident in the actual film.<BR>The only let down to the effects is the licker. This creature looks great standing still, but when it starts to move it shows that the Computer FX did not do well, it looks jagged and flimsy and almost laughable, but apart from that the FX are fine. <BR>However the DVD to say the least is Poor, the extras on it are pathetic compared to other less hyped films. The interviews with the cast and crew are too short and there are not enough of them, the trailers are old and poorly transferred, unlike the actual film, which transferred very well, and the Wide screen anamorphic - 1.85:1 looks great. The thing that could have made this DVD could have been the edition of so much more, like how about a Resident Evil mini game for DVD-ROMS, extended commentary from the director or even some stills would have been nice. An interview with CAPCOM would have gone down a treat with both fans of the movie and the game alike also how about some histories behind the Games as well. But the biggest edition to the extras that was missing was the deleted scenes. The film looks as if it has been cut a bit to try and get it in to the 100 min market and also not seem to long winded, after all there is only a certainamount you can do with Zombies, but still it would have been nice to have seen some, Christ if Disney put deleted scenes in their DVDS surely Columbia/Tri-Star can?<BR>The saving grace is the Slipknot music video, as a fan it was great and the background pictures from the film made it even better, if your not a fan you may not even look at it but if you are then buy it just for this. <BR>Overall a good sound film that will probably end up being shown on Christmas Night around 11:45 after the news, but hey if you're a fan see it, if your not see it anyway, but if you can wait and see if a directors cut comes out. Like the title says I think Romero would like it a lot!<br />I though i would put this in as i mentioned it in the review. it a small list of the references to Alice in Wonderland, although small it is interesting to see.<br />1. Milla Jovovich's Character is called Alice<BR>2. Around the clock in the mansion are pictures from Alice in    Wonderland<BR>3. The central computer is called the Red Queen.<br />I just thought it was interesting as the directors brief for himself was for a different view on the Alice in Wonderland story, and that puts a whole new light on the story. 5th year students studying Shakesphere forget that soon you will be analysing this movie for its deep metaphorical meaning, maybee, perhaps not.
0743201140|1.0|While the Gallup organization is well known for it's polling abilities, and their previous book, &quot;First Break all the Rules&quot; is a respected management tool, it appears the authors felt it was time to write another book, whether or not they had enough new material or not.  <br />The basic premise is that we all have strengths and we should find those, capitalize on those and manage around our weaknesses.  A reasonable message, and one that is pretty well covered in the first 15-20 pages.  The rest of the book is filler to expand the book to 260 pages.  After all, who would pay a list price of US$28 for a 20 page booklet?<br />There are other management books out there that are far superior.  Pass on this one.
0790733226|4.0|This movie kept me glued to my seat and filled with a great sense of wonder, until the explorer reaches her destination.  That part was disappointing.  I was left unfulfilled at that point.  Curiously, I did like the ending quite a bit.  <br />Still, the movie was excellent and is well worth seeing.
B0000683DH|5.0|I cannot begin to express my gratitude towards Paramount for this director's edition release.  For some 10 years now, I've been waiting for a retail version of this film to come out with the &quot;missing&quot; footage from the ABC Sunday Night Movie version.  Finally, here it is, with all the dialogue reincorporated into it, even if it doesn't have the alternating camera shots between Kirk and Saavik's faces in the turbolift.  It's quite pleasing.  Now, all we need is for the respective companies to put the deleted scenes from movies like &quot;Firebirds&quot; back into them on their own DVD releases.
B000066744|5.0|I, like one of the other reviewers, briefly saw this on a transatlantic plane-ride...but didn't realize til halfway thru (and less than 1/2 hour out of JFK) what it was, not having my headphones on!, til too late.  I searched the web for months and months afterwards trying to find it. FINALLY it has been released, and what a gem it is. I didn't realize it was by the director of CINEMA PARADISO (another MUST-SEE), but it totally makes sense. First of all, as a pianist, I can tell you that the piano \\"faking\\" by Roth and Williams is FABULOUS! (We won't go into the trumpet mimicry, although I think Pruitt Taylor Vince is a major talent.)  And the pianists and piano music for the film's soundtrack are spectacular. This is a magical, mystical fairytale type story.  It would make a mesmerizing stage musical, and I hope to see that someday. If you love magical,romantic, witty and intelligent fables, this is for you. The original Italian novel (NOVECENTO) has yet to be translated into English, which is a shame, because it's VERY short and should have come out with the US release.  Although there are no extra features on the DVD, enjoy!Tim Roth at his BEST!<br /><br />Update! (1/7/10) I'm in my final year of teaching high school music. Last year I taught my last Music Theory class, and it only had 3 students. But what a 3! One incredible musician/pianist, a dancer, and a football player. We had an incredible bond, and when I realized that there was never a film you could show to a music theory class for fun/enrichment, I chose to show this one as a little break after midterms. They were mesmerized. All three were seniors and I gave them each a copy of this for graduation. You'd think they'd been given a new ipod they were so happy!!!
B00003CXI0|4.0|I enjoy all types of movies and had heard about harry potter, but I had never read any of the books or followed the harry potter stories.  I was happily suprised how fun it was to watch and the movie was so entertaining that I bought the books so that I would be ready for the next movie(s).  The story was fun to watch along with the special effects which I thought were superb for the child and the adult. It was more than I expected.
B00002EPJH|5.0|I can't seem to pull myself back to work and away from this beautiful music.  I have always loved Keith Jarrett solo, and he has satisfied my desire for beautiful, loving, classic solo piano with this CD. The songs in and of themselves are classics, and I have known many of them since childhood.  &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot;,  &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;, &quot;Shenandoh&quot; -  all lovely, familiar, and I find myself humming along.   I am not a jazz fan, but I am passionate about the piano. This CD really answers my call for the perfect recorded piano music.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Incredible musicians aside, enchanting, almost haunting lyrics aside...Dire Straits can claim something almost no other group can.  Mark Knopfler lends a voice that is virtually another instrument.  Listen to this album, and forget that he is singing...rather imagine what you hear is an instrument, that you can understand. If you don't already own this album...you soon will.
B00006G8G4|5.0|this carries the true spirit of Spider-man and of a superhero . this dvd will be great for every avid fan of spider-man and then some.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I've been a Dm fan from the start...from the Vince Clark days, since he left to form Yaz (thats Yazoo in England then then on to Erasure), and i am a HUGE DM fan. Since living in Canada i have missed a few concerts, but i've been to the last 2 in Vancouver and EXCITER was a knockout. This album is beyond words, ULTRA was very good and more than made up for some of the tracks on SONGS OF FAITH (but that had HALO and WALKING so whos complaing). WHEN THE BODY SPEAKS is a beautiful song and if you've seen it performed live you'll see the chemistry between Dave and Martin and you'll understand. I FEEL LOVED is a booming BM song in the best tradition of ENJOY THE SILENCE an PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE. I could go on for ever, but i'm running out of words. Suffice to say, this is a great album, and worth every penny. I also HIGHLY reccommend the EXICTER LIVE IN PARIS DVD - a very good worthwhile purchase!!!!!
B000062YB1|5.0|No band does is like Slayer.  Metallica, even in their \\"good days\\" had nothing on Slayer.  This album is sick.  Dead Skin Mask is my favorite.  GET THIS ONE!!!!
0930289234|5.0|This story takes on a much more chilling aspect after the events of Sept. 11.  This story held up amazingly before that day, reading it again afterwards... &lt;shiver&gt;.<br />This is a story with depth. Often the panels reflect the same scene from different perspective, with the focus shifting between the concurrent threads of the character's lives.<br />Look for the recurrent use of the blood spatter symbolism. The art work adds a dimension to the story telling that was unique for it's time.<br />Over the years I've heard rumors that a Watchman movie was in the works.  There seems to be something fundamentally wrong when Mystery Men can make it to the big screen and not The Watchmen. Perhaps its echos of the events of Sept 11, and the aftermath of the events of that day, will bring this story back into the light.
B000003S28|5.0|The worlds that MFF explores are Eno's most interesting.  Sonically I find much of this albumn very similar (if instrumental) to the second half of Before and After Science.<br />In any event, I find these tracks transport me to a twilight land where nature, science and a little magic all converge.  This is where I want to live.<br />My only Criticisms are that the whole albumn and the individual tracks are too short... I find myself wanted to explore each further and then before I know it the albumn is over.<br />Also, it's a tease.  I love the places he goes with this... very corporeal and evocative... but he teases us into thinking he'll return here, and as of yet I have not heard him do so.<br />Brian if you're reading, there's more to explore here!
0380973650|5.0|I've only read one other book by Neil Gaiman, and I didn't really like it. However, I'm glad I decided to give him another chance, because this book was great! Granted, it's probably more enjoyable to read if you know a little about &quot;the old gods&quot; ahead of time, but I thought the whole idea for the book was both clever and fascinating. The idea that technological gadgets are North America's new &quot;gods&quot; isn't necessarily original, but this is the first time I've seen them represented as physical characters in a novel. If you're weird like me and have wondered what Odin would be like if you met him in the street, this book is for you.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|A cool movie, great plot, excellent special effects.  I loved the original and when I heard this was going to be remade I was very pleased.  The time machine delivers all around, buy the DVD, or if not you MUST rent it.  Cool special features.
B000001GQT|3.0|If your CD collection has room for only one disc of Richard Strauss' orchestral music, I guess it should be either this one or the RCA Living Stereo CD with Fritz Reiner's 1954 renditions of \\"Zarathustra\\" and \\"Ein Heldenleben.\\" Nearly 80 minutes of peerless playing and a master hand waving the baton (although I wonder: was it a production goof or an interpretive quirk that abruptly squelched the tolling of the \\"midnight bell\\" after a pretty audible splice in the work's final section?). That said, I think all of the works on this disc benefit from a little more transparency than is allowed by either Karajan's homogenized, string-heavy balances or DG's synthetic production (e.g., those swelling strings in track 2 that just keep getting louder and louder and LOUDER; I can picture the technicians riding the volume controls at the mixing console). You can find performances which offer that extra clarity without going to the opposite extreme of Reiner's \\"anti-lush\\" approach. For instance, there's a Decca Legends CD coupling all four of these pieces in late-'50s/early-'60s recordings, with the Vienna Philharmonic sounding much more idiomatic and vibrant if a little untidy compared to the glossy BPO (and \\"Zarathustra\\" on the Decca CD suffers sonically from the need to overdub the organ in the famous opening and elsewhere; aside from that, the recorded sound on the Decca disc is much more natural than what you get here). The conductor on that CD? The very same Herbert von Karajan.
B000051VWW|5.0|Now I'll admit that I'm a fanatic(I mean FANATIC!) of Sade Adu.And I'll fess up and say that I think that Sade can't do much wrong.Let's face it there isn't a bad or a corny Sade song out there.Her music is PERFECTION in the modern age if there is any.Sade and her brillant band(Stuart Matthewman,Andrew Hale,Paul S. Denmark) make such seamless slow soul magic.How can anyone not like them? I mean every ruffneck type folks love Sade.I love every type of music availble to man and I LOVE Sade.<BR>So that's why I was shocked,bewildered,and admittely disapointed to see all the negative reviews of Sade's breathtaking 2000 release,\\"Lovers Rock\\".The reviews were cruel and just plain incorrect.Since when did folks try to say that Sade couldn't sing? SADE CAN'T SING?!!! Huh? And what you guys have to understand is that Sade is a true artist and is the only artist from the electronic overload that was the 1980s to fully make that creative and commerical transition to the 1990s<BR>and beyond.Sure the music wasn't THAT big of a change from Sade's earlier megahits but they showed growth,maturity,and reinnovation in a very subtle way.So let's keep that in mind...<br />\\"Lovers Rock\\" was Sade's first album since 1992's elegant \\"Love Deluxe\\".\\"Lovers Rock\\" marked a change for Sade's musical ouvere.<BR>The production on \\"Lovers\\" is very rugged,less polished.It's very bare and minilaistic but not in a pretenious,unexciting,faux-\\"arty\\" sense but in a quiet,reflective way.No show-offy vocal tricks and slapdash \\"of the moment\\" production here.No appearances from rappers for street cred with the kiddies.Sade is above current musical trends.She's timeless.<BR>The lyrics,like always,are deep and vauge.The music is spare,easy,and accented with dub and of course lovers rock(the soft,sweet reggae style after whom the album cops it's title from).Gone are the soaring sax solos by Matthewman replaced by steady,midtempo grooves and lots of acoustic cadence.\\"Lovers Rock\\" doesn't have the wallop of \\"Diamond Life\\",down-under elegance of \\"Promise\\",funkiness of \\"Stronger Than Pride\\",or moodiness of \\"Love Deluxe\\",yet still packs all the grace,senstivity,class,and serenity of all those albums.After the fourty four minute journey is down,it feels like a prayer.<BR>Solemn and quiet yet full of power.<BR>All eleven tracks are noteworthy but the hypnotic \\"Flow\\",gustful \\"King Of Sorrow\\",minilaistic beauty of \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\",easy ragga breeze of \\"All About Our Love\\",and the plain powerful \\"Every Word\\" all deserve mention.As do \\"Slave Song\\" and \\"Immigrant\\" will like \\"Feel No Pain\\" from \\"Love Deluxe\\" beautifully and meaningfully lament over racial injustice.\\"LR\\" closes with the mournful yet strangely optimistic \\"It's Only Love That Gets You Through\\",a metaphrocial anthem of coming to the end of the road of life,so to speak.<BR>Powerful stuff.<br />\\"Lovers Rock\\" was THE best album of 2000,the year of Eminem's marketing tactic \\"antics\\" and N'Sync and Britney Spears' ubiqtious commericality.Now in twenty years when Eminem,N'Sync,and Spears will be long gone but Sade and \\"Lovers Rock\\" will still play on.This is music that's accessible and original yet meaningful and powerful.And it reminds you that Sade has ZERO peers.This woman stands alone.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Once I walked out of the movie theatre seeing this movie, I realized I had really been inspired. Everything about the movie was very...good.<br />Yesterday, I was walking about Priceton University giving friends a tour of it. We discovered a train station there that we had not yet seen. A train  pulled up and the Actual John Nash appeared. We met up with him and talked with him for a minute. I must say, Russel Crowe played him very well. I am very surprised he did not win the oscar.
1577311523|5.0|After 12 years of searching, reading hundreds of books leading me down lots of dead ends, and living a life on an emotional roller coaster, finally I read something that really speaks to me. This is a fantastic book to begin your journey towards \\"completeness\\".  It has changed the way I think, like no other book.   But that's where the cliché ends - don't expect your life to improve - mine has actually got worse!  Intellectually/spiritually for the better, but internally it's turmoil, and I can only hope this is what mystics call \\"dark night of the soul\\", because surly it can't get any worse, can it?  My girlfriend has gone, I sold my flash car, and I watched my attitude dissolve into humbleness due to difficult surroundings.  As for worldly desires, I don't really have any except to try and make my life simple.<br />Now once you have read and understood The Power of Now, you simply have to read \\"I AM THAT\\" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. I know it's expensive (or at least in the UK it is), but trust me, I have this by my bedside always, and reading just a page or two before I sleep fills me with hope.
B00005OM4Q|2.0|I just don't get it. This movie was MAYBE good. People treat Crowe like he is the Second Coming after this flick.
6303855466|3.0|This movie left me with a just-missed feeling. It started out well, with an amusing idea and interesting characters. The problem was, it never got beyond that. The first 20 minutes or so was the best part of the story. Unfortunately, the colorful, eccentric characters were never developed beyond simple character sketches. Even in a whimsical comedy, you need a little more substance. <br />The same was true for the plot. There is no real feeling of suspense or tension. I bought the idea that the townspeople cared about their mountain, and they got me to care about it, too. But again, even a whimsical comedy should make you wonder about the outcome, just to engage you emotionally. <br />The only real suspense here was when it would stop raining, so the villagers could finish building the mound. <br />The scenes with the villagers playing tricks to keep the Englishmen from leaving were cute, but went on too long. The romance could have been sweet, but again there was nothing to it. No conflict, tension or character development. Why are these two people falling in love? (Plenty of potential obstacles since she's a maid and he's obviously upperclass). Again, even a whimsical love story should make you care.<br />Hugh Grant plays his usual mannerisms. Here they seemed exactly in place, perfect for a WWI era upper class Englishman. His only problem was the same as the other characters: no character development. (Oh, and an overly-slicked hairstyle that sometimes looked cemented in place.) But like the others, he didn't have enough substance to come alive.<br />Ian McNeice deserves highest marks here for his memorable take on a stock English character. Even his flamingo pink waistcoat was perfect.<br />The movie did make me laugh more than once, and it provided a pleasant if fairly forgettable evening's entertainment. However, I thought tht with a little more work and care, it could have been another Waking Ned Divine or Cold Comfort Farm. Both of these movies are just as whimsical as &quot;The Englishman...&quot;, but they have a substance to their storytelling that makes you feel, at the end, that you've been somewhere, that you've been told a great story. I wish I could say the same here.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with a very original plot. It shows the prejudices of a small and narrow-minded community towards anything that comes from the outside. The local aristocrat rules over the village as a feudalist landlord. The opening of the chocolaterie comes into this - to say the least - conservative setting like thunder and lightening. Obviously, the landlord immediately sets out for maintaining desperately the social and moral status quo undermined now by the exotic owner of the chocolate shop.<br />You cannot better show to what results prejudices and sudden judgements can lead. Wonderful. I would recommend this film to everybody who is interested in the display of various characters and their interactions. All the characters are wonderfully played.<br />I liked especially the young priest dancing to Elvis' tunes while working in the garden. Just wonderful.
0553269631|5.0|McCullers' \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" was such an amazing reading experience. This was my second time reading this novel and i learned so much more from reading it a couple years later. The character are so intense and real. McCuller just did such an incredible job with character development. It's as if she knew all these people personally. I definitely recommend this to anyone that is into heavy thinking.
B000063K5W|3.0|I have a feeling that in later years this movie will be as big a cult classic as ROCKY HORROR or BLOODSUCKING FREAKS. No, its not a great movie, but it has just the right amount of weirdness, pomp and some pretty good rock music to become one of the first major cult sucesses of the 21st century. It centers around a German transexual who after a sex change op gone wrong leaves him with the \\"angry inch\\" of the title, is appalled when his secret gay lover steals credit for his music and becomes a number one chart success and sets out to get his music back. The music is pretty good, but the movie itself isn't completely sucessful. That said it works better as a film because the visual elements including animation add to what is a rather bizarre, unique viewing experience. Naturally, I haven't seen the musical on which it is based (typical of me, I know) but I recommend it if you are in the mood to watch something a little different, though personally I think ROCKY HORROR stands head and shoulders over HEDWIG any day.
B00005JLEX|5.0|It is an emergency ! Seinfeld is not as popular in France as Friend or The Simpsons, but it's obviously one of the best american series ever.

I can't stand it anymore (and million of people with me) !<BR>And please, do me a favor, don't forget the french subtitles (and german, spanish, portuguese ... or whatever) Everybody has to understand it.

B00003CXI1|2.0|the books were good but not great and the movie was okay.
B00000DFSK|4.0|Although all these songs are great, I give this collection 4 stars because they are much more at home in their original album settings. U2 is a band that has made phenomenal, cohesive albums in which 99% of the tunes are worthwhile (save the weak ATYCLB). So this collection isn't necessary unless you're the type that ONLY appreciates top 40 singles.<BR>How I would rate their albums:<BR>BOY . . . . . . . . . . . . . ****<BR>OCTOBER . . . . . . . . . . . *****<BR>WAR . . . . . . . . . . . . . *****<br />UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY . . . . *****<BR>THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE . . . *****<BR>THE JOSHUA TREE . . . . . . . ***** <BR>RATTLE AND HUM . . . . . . . ****<BR>ACHTUNG BABY . . . . . . . . *****<BR>ZOOROPA . . . . . . . . . . . ****<BR>POP . . . . . . . . . . . . . ****<BR>ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE . . **<br />The B-side disk occasionally available with this singles collection contains some of their best music ever, especially \\"Walk To The Water\\" and \\"Luminous Times (Hold Onto Love).\\" I have most of these B-sides on vinyl and I can tell you they should have included the \\"Deep In The Heart\\" B-side, another great one. So skip the singles collection unless you need the B-sides!
B000065V1V|5.0|This is simply the best recording David has made since Scary Monsters. It is equally as good. With David Torn on guitar and atmospheres, all the essential elements that Fripps guitar had on the older Bowie material is now present once again. Jordan Rudess also adds to the tracks he plays on. Great lineup of musicians on this one and Bowie's material is classic Bowie! Took a trip on a gemini spacecraft...and I thought about you...  Dont' pass this one up!
B00001NFCY|4.0|I've never been a great fan of rock music, mainly because I have found so much of it to convey messages of hopelessness, futility, and frustration, even desparation.  So much of a feeling that one can't cope without lots of drugs, sex, and violence, and even then, it's a losing battle.<br />So the lyrics and sound of Creed are refreshing.  I do see a lot of comments calling Creed's music \\"Christian rock\\" or religious and I don't get that from their music at all.  I believe that they consider themselves Christian, but don't think they're warmly accepted in the Christian rock community.  The lyrics are self expressive and not preachy.  The message that I hear is that of one searching, and of one who believes that there is more to life than sex, drugs, money.  I hear one who believes in man's spiritual side, and is seeking it and suggesting that others might find more value in life by seeking something higher than the most material goals.  I don't find that concept exclusively Christian or religious, but more of a thinking man's concept that there is a purpose.  And there's no preaching, because it's left to the listener to find that purpose for her- or him-self.  <br />Well, don't necessarily take my word for it because I don't claim to be a true rock fan.  I just like some music and not like some music.  <br />This CD I like, and if you give it a chance, maybe you'll like it.
B000002UA2|5.0|All I have to say is that this is one of the best albums ever. I absolutely love it. It should really get more credit and not be so hidden behind 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'The Wall'; it just plainly rocks.
B000001E18|4.0|When this album first came out I really liked a few songs, listened to it a lot for the first few weeks, and then shelved it and forgot about it for several years. Pulling it out again recently, I discovered a much better album than I remembered. It shows the band playing with new sounds and textures than they had previously. Lemon and Numb are my favorites, but there are other good tracks too. I'd definitely not rate Zooropa above Achtung Baby, Joshua Tree, or War, but it clearly fits as a segway in U2's evolution between Achtung Baby and the over the top Pop.
B000001ELD|4.0|This underrated classic has drawn heavy criticism from so-called \\"fans\\" because it refuses to bend to one musical style.To say that Gene didn't take his solo project seriously is stupid; it gave him a chance to show a hitherto unseen musical side. Many of the tracks were old ones that wouldn't have suited the heavy metal stomp of Kiss.This is the my favourite of the solo albums.Ace's reveals a talent to be reckoned with; Paul's is good,but predictable; and Peter's . . .let's just say he tried,and leave it at that. Give GENE SIMMONS a listen again . . .you might be happily surprised.<br />RADIOACTIVE - A chilling laugh starts off the show in fine style. After an intro of puesdo-operatics, the real song emerges; a piano-led rocker with great harmony vocals. Love the 'bubbling' sound effects!<br />BURNING UP WITH FEVER - We kick off this little tune of with a couple of 'rushed' acoustic guitar(and a comment of \\"Lovely\\" from Gene!). What follows is a number in the syle of ALIVE II's 'Larger Than Life', guitar funk complete with female backup on the chorus and Donna Summer's vocals near the end of the track.<br />SEE YOU TONITE - Mr Simmons has always expressed an admiration for the Beatles, and when he couldn't get Paul MacCartney to contribute to this album, he got not only a soundalike,but a lookalike to take his place! Two members of the hit Broadway show<BR>Beatlemania contribute backup vocals on a few of the tracks. This soft number was brought out for Kiss' MTV UNPLUGGED show to great effect!<br />TUNNEL OF LOVE - Could have been a castoff from either 'Rock'n'Roll Over' or 'Love Gun'. Good crunchy guitar riffs and female backup on the chorus.<br />TRUE CONFESSIONS - I don't know how Gene got Helen Reddy for backup vocals on this song; it's a nice touch. Clever lyrics too:\\"I'm not your social security, I'm not your star opportunity\\".<br />LIVING IN SIN - The lustful demon we all know and love. He really gets into the role so well with this one. Cher contributes a cameo as an excited fan in the song's middle (Gene would reciprocate with a cameo on one of Cher's tunes). Love the grunting noises simmons utters in the songs fade out . . .LOL!<br />ALWAYS NEAR YOU/NOWHERE TO HIDE - Soft rock complete with choir and orchestra. This track somehow leaves me cold. I guess the lyrics seem a bit 'too simple'. <br />MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES - A tribute to one Simmon's cinematic heroes, Lon Chaney Sr; this was written by the 'Dressed To Kill'<br />sessions, but somehow didn't fit in with the 'Kiss'image. The lyrics could be used as a metaphor in describing the personality of Gene Simmons himself.<br />MR MAKE BELIEVE - The original 'monster of rock' showing his tender side,complete with backup vocals by his 'Beatlemania' buddies. Probably my favourite GENE SIMMONS track.<br />SEE YOU IN YOUR DREAMS - I don't understand why Gene wanted to remake this song (only recorded two years before on 'Rock'n'Roll Over).The only difference is an extra verse. The original is much simpler and better sounding. Another Simmons RARO tune 'Love 'Em And Leave 'Em',was also re-recorded, but not released. <br />WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR - Gene copped a lot of flak for covering this, his favourite Disney song. He claims the lyrics ring true in real life. Not as bad as it could have been; which is a good summing up for the entire solo album.
B00004Y5A8|5.0|Unlike a lot of the overblown versions on his first five albums, one of which being the magnificent Ziggy Stardust, those presented here are live and very stripped down, allowing you to hear the song instead of the studio.  Surprisingly, the primitive sound of these recordings sound fresher when heard for the first time today than the produced album versions, which can sound dated due to the use of late '60's/early '70's production techniques.  Also, the versions of Space Oddity songs with Mick Ronson on guitar add a more rock feel and therefore fit better alongside the Ziggy stuff, which start to appear toward the album's end.  A good representation of a hungry pre-fame Bowie, when he still sang in a higher register.  The energy on this is as electric as it can get, and that's all that he was shooting for back then.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Même si le film a reçu une critique très sévère lors de sa sortie en salle en raison des attentes très hautes adressées à l'arrière arrière petit fils de H.G. Wells, l&#8217;auteur du roman, Simon Wells, la version 2002 du film n'en demeure pas moins une oeuvre fort intéressante soutenu par des images d'une rare beauté ainsi que d'une musique très touchante ! <br />L'histoire du film se démarque de la version 1960 de George Pal tout en y faisant quelques clins d&#8217;&#339;ils. Moi j'ai bien aimé les deux versions pour différentes raisons. À vous de juger ! À mes yeux, il n'y a pas de compétition entre les deux versions, l'une complète l'autre. <br />En ce qui concerne l'éditon standard du DVD, elle est très satisfaisante : une excellente qualité d'image, un son de référence (DD5.1 Ang. Fr., DTS, etc), 2 pistes de commentaires audio, \\"featurettes\\" sur la création des morloks, de la fameuse machine à explorer le temps, différents dessins de la conception de la machine, etc. <br />Étant de la génération de la première version du film, j&#8217;étais très heureux de retrouver les personnages et la machine dans une version technologiquement actualisée. Si vous êtes comme moi, l'imagerie de la machine à voyager dans le temps restera marquée pour toujours dans votre mémoire...
B000069CWE|3.0|\\"Reanimation\\" isn't a bad album, but it's no follow-up to Hyrbid Theory. The songs definetly aren't your average remixs, and the idea didn't always work. Most songs had a slower tempo, which can be almost frusterating, and some of the guest singers didn't flatter any of the tracks. It would have been better if they had cut down on the tracks, maybe to 8 or 9 songs plus the interludes, and put more time into their next album (which is due early next year). Here's a quick rating of each song...<BR>02. Pts.Of.Athrty - My favorite on the album. Almost as good as the origanal. 9/10<BR>03. Enth E nd - Wouldn't have been bad if they didn't change the lyrics, or at least Mike's part. 5/10<BR>05. Frgt/10 - They completly butchered it. Worst song on the album. 4/10<BR>06. P5hng Me A*wy - Not bad. I like the beat, but once again, the changed lyrics did not flatter the song. 7/10<BR>07. Plc.4.Mie.Haed - Another nice beat, but the guest singer ruined it. 5/10<BR>09. H! Vltg3 - The music doesn't really fit the song. 5/10<BR>11. Wth>You - All the mixing comes together pretty well here. 8/10<BR>13. Ppr:Kut - A little to slow for my liking, but still good. 6/10<BR>14. Rnw@y - Another good one. The origanal lyrics were better, but the new ones are good and the beat's great. 7/10<BR>15. My<Dsmber - Another mix done well. 8/10<BR>17. By_Myslf - Too slow, but for once the lyric changes improve the song. 7/10<BR>18. Kyur4 Th Ich - Not as good as the first. 5/10<BR>19. 1Stp Kloser - The only song that's better then the origanal. 8/10<BR>20. Krwlng - I love this song. It's not nearly as good as \\"Crawling\\" but it really is a whole new song. 9/10<BR>Total: 93/140<br />All in all, it's really more of a hip-hop album then a rock album, and I'm more of a rock fan. I recommend all die-hard LP fans buy it, and everyone else burn it or download it.
0312265859|3.0|The first six books of the Stephanie Plum series were a hoot.  At points they had me laughing so hard that my sides hurt.   The plots twisted, the villians were twisted, her family only a little less so, Stephanie's car blew up, there was lust, and then there was LUST!!!.  Although the seventh book was a little below par it still had its moments.<BR>In this book there was a plot, there was lust (only written small), cars blew up, but the whole thing didn't hold together that well.  It tried to be funny, but didn't get up to the earlier standards.  I think Ms. Evanovich painted herself in a corner with Stephanie and Ranger, after flirting around with getting them in bed for 3 books she devotes all of a half page to it.  Come on guys -  this is something that Stephanie has been obsessing about since she met the man and a half page?? More space was devoted to the purchase of shoes in earlier books.  <BR>Like I said, I will buy the next book, but as a paperback and not pre-order the hardback.  I hope Ms. Evanovich gets her, and Stephanies groove back.
0440539811|5.0|Wilson and Shea turn the 60s and the 70s on their heads. Just about any conspiracy will turn up in this magnum opus. A classic in Nixon era paranoia!

B000001FRY|5.0|BOY is U2`s debut album and in many ways its their finest album . It has a streamlined new wave popesque sound helped somewhat by Steve Lillywhite`s production ( Compare STORIES FOR BOYS and OUT OF CONTROL from the 1979 U2-3 EP to see what I mean ) but most of all it was written by the most talented quartet to have come out of the british Isles since The Beatles . I WILL FOLLOW is a masterpiece that never charted in Britain but is a firm favourite at concerts , and I remember the local under 18s disco used to play this track in 1984 and everyone would get up and dance to it , this song would make a corpse feel alive . TWILIGHT , OUT OF CONTROL and STORIES FOR BOYS are improvements on their 1979 releases , and BOY finishes on the extremely moody and haunting SHADOWS AND TALL TREES . <br />All in all a classic album which didn`t exactly set the world alight when it was released 22 years ago which was a great pity , especially when compared to the  JOSHUA TREE which sold zillions of copies but doesn`t really touch the raw and perhaps even naive passion of BOY. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay this album is that it has a timeless quality , it would have sounded great in 1976 , 1986 , 1996 and will still sound great in 2026

B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman, by any measure, stays more true to the original than any other attempt at bringing a comic book character to the big screen. It's not as campy and sappy as Superman or as lurid and pretentious as Batman. The special effects have been criticized, but unjustly in my view. They have the feel of a comic book, much like certain action sequences in THE other great comics-come-to-life movie--Spawn. Batman (the first one) is a distant third in this genre; while JOR-EL is turning in his Kryptonian grave until a new, updated movie is made about his super son.

B00005IC2H|4.0|Bjork does not have the monopoly on interesting Icelandic music.  Sigur Ros has joined the fray, although its otherwordly sound may turn off mainstream listeners.  \\"Svefn-G-Englar,\\" the ten minutes plus elegiac mindscape that opened up a vanilla sky, is replete with strings, beeps, \\"It's you\\" and blaring My Bloody Valentine distortions.  This number will unleash a good cry if one is pent up inside, or make a wonderful kind of sad while watching a heavy rain from your window.  It's the sweet melancholy of life in over ten minutes.  However, if one is standing on top of a tall building, it will either make one reconsider and sigh, \\"Well, maybe, I'll give it another go\\" or think, \\"I've lived enough.  Time to jump.\\"<br />That is followed by \\"Staralfur,\\" with heartbeat drums, heart-melting strings, and slowed down Massive Attack-style trip-hop.  The symphonic part of this could fit in a soundtrack, maybe as a finale for some movie.<br />\\"Flugufrelsarinn,\\" with its loud organ and vocals, becomes an ambient power ballad.  The moody \\"Ny Batteri\\" begins like latter day Moby, then accompanied by a pounding percussive beat and then a blaring wall of sound.  So does \\"Hjartad Hamast,\\" with a rising crescendo of a sound that resembles roaring engines.<br />The soft piano and symphonic strings of the beautifully sad \\"Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa\\" is a soothing rest after the series of noise distortion.  For the first 7:45 of the song, anyway.  Then that My Bloody Valentine sound erupts, but the strings, now at an emotional crescendo, are there as well to accompany the rise in mood.  Another 10 minutes+ song and it's my second favorite.<br />\\"Olsen Olsen\\" is a mid-paced number with falsetto vocals, pronounced bass, drums, strings, and horns and choir that, as in songs throughout the album, rises to an emotional pitch near the end.  The title track is more low key, but akin to the previous song.<br />\\"Avalon\\" doesn't have that many fancy tricks, just a synthesizer and some plucked strings at the end.<br />Sigur Ros is a cross between Massive Attack, My Bloody Valentine, and Moby.  And Agaetis Byrjun is a swim in a lake that's haunting, chilling, mind-blowing, melting, and meditative all at once.  So if you're feeling adventurous, introspective, and want to feel a happy kind of sad, or sad kind of happy, this one's for you.gs at the end.<br />Sigur Ros is a cross between Massive Attack, My Bloody Valentine, and Moby.

B00000JGHM|5.0|This movie is excellent. It has some of the best action scenes of all time, as well as some of the coolest lines, the most interesting characters depicted by an expert cast ...the whole thing is just awesome. The whole time I was watching this movie I was transfixed by director Michael Mann's expert maneuverings. I just knew that I was in the process of seeing a masterpiece. The film delves into the differences(or lack thereof) between the highest form of cop and the highest form of criminal. De Niro's Neil McCauley is just as heroic as Pacino's Vince Hanna. These guys are so cool that their confrontation should be the most famous scene in American cinema. Unfortunately, many who have seen this movie have revealed their own idiocy in saying it is bad. This movie has not had enough exposure by any means. The DVD itself does not have enough features, but you should do yourself a favor and buy it anyway. Treat yourself to Mann's masterwork of a movie, and afterwards tell your friends about its pure awesomeness.
B00005JKWJ|1.0|Since I really enjoyed the first Blade, I was excited about the sequel. This film was a terrible disappointment. Instead of utilizing traditional filmmaking tools, such as actors, plot, and character development, director Guillermo del Toro throws in one lame action sequence after another. Don't think that this endless action is a good thing. Half the fighting is uninspired and full of pitiful CGI.  Where the final showdown in part 1 was a classic kenjutsu duel, in part 2 it is a stupid brawl, replete with ridiculous wrestling moves. I'm using the word stupid a lot because that is the word that this entire movie reeks of. It is as if the movie was designed to deliver cheap thrills that would only satisfy the stupid. I was insulted by this movie, as if the director was suggesting I was stupid and trying to take my money by tricking me into seeing this trash. It is obvious that  Guillermo del Toro was not affiliated with the first Blade, as there is an absence of complete stinkiness in that movie. The first movie was by no means perfect, and so I thought that this one would expand on the first and continue an entertaining and noble franchise. Sadly, this movie did not do so. This is the kind of sequel that makes you ashamed that you saw the first one at all. Pure filth.

0316666343|4.0|The words from Alice Sebolds' \\"The Lovely Bones\\" will be with me for eternity.<br />She richly blends the lyrics of Susie Salmon's requiem into a story that disturbs, haunts, yet draws you in.  I was literally hooked by Susie Salmon's story before I even had my hands on the book.  I had read an interview with the author, and thought that the book sounded unique. I then read some of it here at Amazon, and had to buy it.<br />This book is definitely worth purchasing.  Susie is raped and murdered by creepy neighbor, George Harvey.  Looking down from Heaven and into the family and friends left behind, she narrates the entire story.<br />Characters in the book are all drawn out so well. You feel as if you really know them.<br />This is a story about redemption.  It is extremely well told. Sebold has a true talent for originality and prose.<br />I will never forget this book, and will probably read it again.<br />I will lend it out to everyone I know that would appreciate this innovative and moving story.<br />My only complaint is that I think some words were too big for a 14 year old to pull off. I often thought: Would this girl really say that? I'm in my 30's and had to use a thesaurus to read this book.  Sebold surely has an extensive vocabulary, but she needs to find more teenaged words to use.<br />I know it was the 1970's. Where teens more sophisticated with their words then?<br />STILL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!<br />Eileen Famiglietti
B00005YXZH|1.0|&quot;Most Overrated Album of the 21st Century&quot; - I couldn't agree with your review more.  If this is a critically acclaimed album, worthy of tons of accolades than we are in HUGE trouble artistically.  I was sorely disappointed.

B00002DEGZ|5.0|John Eliot Gardiner and Mr. Bilson deliver the goods on some of my favorite music in the world. After about 5 seconds you get over the fact that it's a fortepiano. To me, the fortepiano best suits Mozart's busy sound, those magic fingers running up and down the keyboard. And the orchestra! On the money. Just listen to the orchestra come in in the beginnng of the 20th concerto. Wham! And they bring out colors and tones I haven't heard before; the winds do well here. A 3-CD set of the concertos 20-27 is out there if you don't want all of it. Highly recommended.
6305910340|5.0|This movie will hit close to home with just about anybody. It's about a boy coming of age, a father wanting his son to be the best he can be, and their relationship together. Once the father (Joe Mantegna) realizes his son has a gift for playing chess, he decides to get the boy a tutor(Ben Kingsley). What was once enjoyable for the boy, quickly turns into a chore. The boy learns from two teachers, his tutor, and a street wise hustler(Played well by Laurence Fishbourne) who also has a passion for the game. The boy just wants to be loved. By the end of the movie every charachter has learned a lesson, some way or another. The supporting cast includes William H. Macy, Dan Hedaya, and David Paymer. This movie is not just about chess, it's about relationships. In short, it is a must see!
014028009X|5.0|This book was great. I laughed out loud on a number of occassions.  I really liked it because Bridget Jones is so average, and goes through many of the same situations that average women go through, but proves to be not so average when she finally realizes that she doesn't have to try so hard and just accepts herself.  It's a great confidence booster and a great book to curl up to one night when you need some alone time to pamper yourself.  So put on a face mask, sit and the tub and enjoy it from cover to cover.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This is not an enjoyable film. But a flawlessly effective one. The charachters are so believable. Especially Ellen Burstyn, who is at the top of her game. Things just keep getting worse for the charachters through the movie, and it's almost unbearable too watch. Jennifer Conelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans are all dead on perfect in their portrayals of these drifting souls. All they need is a fix...and they'll do whatever they have too to get one. This movie is undoubtedely disturbing, and one the most powerful of the year (that it was made). The amazing thing about the film is that it's not preachy, it's just telling a story. A story where all hope is gone, and the charachters can only dream of a better place.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I got into Iron Maiden in 2002, well after BNW was released.  No doubt fans welcomed Bruce with arms wide open, as the father welcomed the prodigal son (pun intended).  I sure was excited to hear another album with him, after the average releases with Blaze Bayley as the lead vocalist.<br />How do the results sound?  Great...7/10ths of the time.  There are three weak tracks on the disc, which I will discuss later.  Iron Maiden has been updated to fit snugly in today's metal scene, while retaining their signature sound from the '80s.  (Thank God they haven't down-tuned!)  We're still graced with the pounding riffs and graceful solos (that are still unmatched) thanks to the guitar triumvirate of Dave, Adrian, and Janick.  Some songs include tandem guitar solos that last several minutes, most notably on \\"Nomad\\" and \\"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\".  Steve Harris (founding member and brains behind Iron Maiden) can still play the bass guitar faster than the sound can travel to your ears.  I have always liked Clive Burr better as the drummer, but Nicko does an okay job (maybe too much bass pedal).  Then there's Bruce, whose singing is FANTASTIC, a major upgrade from No Prayer For the Dying.<br />As I mentioned earlier, a couple of the tracks don't hold up as well: \\"The Wicker Man\\", \\"Brave New World\\", and \\"Blood Brothers\\".  They're just too repetitive.  For the refrain, Bruce will sing one line several times, holding a vowel every other time.  \\"Your time will come...your time will cooooooooome!\\"  Then repeat...many times.  There are two songs that more than make up for those, and they are \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" and \\"Thin Line Between Love and Hate\\".  These songs hold up against any songs from Number of the Beast or Powerslave.<br />They have written better material in the past, but Brave New World still makes a wonderful addition to any fan's catalog.  It marks the return of Bruce Dickinson (their best lead vocalist), and it helps to prove that a legendary band such asthis can evolve, yet still produce great music.  Iron Maiden remains one of the two best metal bands in history.
B00003CXTG|4.0|It's hard to call Pearl Harbor great movie making, but those who say the film is a complete waste of time and money are also incorrect. Those moviegoers who saw the tear-jerking war epic and came out shaking their heads in disgust were all expecting too much. Pearl Harbor is meant to be both a historic picture and a love story, but anyone who is able to watch the movie with an open mind will realize that director Michael Bay uses the naval base as the setting for a love triangle. Those who went to the movie expecting a movie about Pearl Harbor and what actually happened there with a sub-plot about a courageous young pilot, his shy best friend and a beautiful nurse we're doomed to be disappointed. <br />The acting isn't awful; the story is emotional and moving and, let's remember, it was an Oscar nominee.
B000067CQK|5.0|Are you kidding! Can anyone review this package as anything less than 5 stars, I mean c'mon... <br />Digitally Remastered with a killer presentation and additional material - including the awesome songs &quot;Holy Holy&quot;, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Head&quot;, this is a real gem of a collection! <br />The packaging is sweet and the songs sound terrific! This is undisputably David Bowie's moment in the sun! To say this is Bowie's best work is to say that Phidias did a pretty decent job on the Parthenon Frieze. <br />I realize that it must frustrate Bowie to think that he'll never top this work, (or escape the eternal inprint of it), by most, if not all, of his fanbase and beyond. But it's true, however much that may displease him. Embrace your past David, don't run from it. Most of us, as living human beings, never have a true defining moment in our lives - we never are blessed enough to have that one spectacular acheivement that defines us in the public's mind forever. Well Mr Bowie is that fortunate, and this is his shining moment of glory. Don't deny it David, be proud of it...I would be.<br />If I was stranded on a deserted island and could only own 3 CDs, WITHOUT QUESTION &quot;Ziggy Stardust &amp; The Spiders From Mars&quot; would be one of the three! It's fitting that we're all given this gift: a remastering CD with lots of goodies!<BR>Thanks David - for everything!
B000002J09|5.0|I tried listening to Led Zepplin whilst in highschool....had heard much about how original they were, etc, but could never &quot;get into&quot; it...it was not until I was in college that I realized marijuana was a requirement to enjoying the scrapes and screeches on the albums....FUNNY, FUNNY STUFF!!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is one of the best dramatic movies I have ever seen. It won the Oscar for Best Picture which I belive it was. Russell Crowe is simply amazing at playing the part of John Nash. Jennifer Connelly deserved her Oscar for her part as Alicia Nash. Ed Harris did a great job as William Parcher. Christopher Plummer did a good job as Dr. Rosen who tries to help John overcome his problems. Paul Bettany also does a fine job as Charles Herman who is John's laid back roomate at Princeton. Ron Howard definetly deserved his Oscar for Best Director for this film. He's fantastic.<br />The DVD of A Beautiful Mind is extremely well done. The picture is fantastic and well detailed. The colors are so vibrant throughout the film. The sound is perfect the entire film. There are also great special features. <br />A Beautiful Mind tells the biography of the brilliant genius of a mathamatician, John Nash. The movie begins in a mathamatics class at Princeton where John Nash had a scholarship to becuase he is so good with math. His rival is the other winner of the scholarship who is always pressuring John. John's roommate helps John cope with thing when they get tough. John also studies people, animals, and other thing then draws there movement on window panes in his dorm room and the library of the college. Nash struggles throughout the movie with life, but his loving wife is always there to help him. <br />This movie is overall extremely brilliant in everyway. There are several unbeliveable twists that are amazing. The movie is so interesting and somewhat emotional. This movie is a winner. John Nash is a hero for what he had to go through. Hes fantastic. Just buy this film if you haven't seen it because this one's a keeper. Thanks
B000001FKY|5.0|Lots of people talk about Pyromania as an ultimate album, and the same has been covered on VH1's series of the same name.  The thing they fail to realize is that the audio insanity that Mutt started experimenting with on Pyromania reached its pinnacle on Hysteria.  There has never been an album with songs this good produced this well.  Any album produced by Mutt Lange is a lesson for those interested in how to make things sound great, but this is the ultimate.  I have the Mobile Fidelity Gold version, and I hope an SACD version is forthcoming.  Can you imagine this in 5.1????
B00000255X|5.0|I own many Dylan albums, as I'm sure many of you. Yet, while there are many more &quot;important&quot; Dylan albums, this one remains my favorite album, the one I keep playing more than any other.<br />Coming on the heels of the great &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, Bob takes a chance by co-writing all songs (the only album he so did) with an &quot;outsider&quot;, Jacques Levy.  No matter, the quality of the songs is top-notch. &quot;Desire&quot; contains of course the well-known protest song &quot;Hurricane&quot;, but that's just the beginning! &quot;Isis&quot; is superb, and &quot;Mozambique&quot; is an also coulda/shoulda been radio hit. &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; generously features Emmy Harris' vocals. The 11 min. &quot;Joey&quot; is the only track that I &quot;don't get&quot; (too long, for one), but it is followed by the great &quot;Romance in Durango&quot; and the very best track on this album &quot;Black Diamond Bay&quot;. The last track &quot;Sara&quot; is fab but sad, heart-breaking really, knowing now how things would turn out for them.<br />As in all of music, it comes down to what appeals to you. For me, Dylan connected on this album better than any other (and there are now 41 Dylan albums, if I can count correctly). If you're on the edge about buying this, be assured, you won't  be disappointed!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden is my favorite pop band. Their music just keeps on getting better and better, but it's a shame they broke up :( Anyways, they have out-done themselves on this CD. They actually write all their songs, unlike some pop acts. Here's my review of their songs...<br />1. Affirmation- A nice song to start the album off with. Has a fast-paced beat and some good lyrics. My fave phrase Darren sings is \\"I believe that junk good tastes so good/Because it's bad for you\\". He says \\"I believe..\\" alot, but I never skip this song. 9/10<br />2. Hold Me- Not really one of my favorites on this CD, but a nice, sweet song about needing to hold someone when you don't feel loved. Worth a listen. 7/10<br />3. I Knew I Loved You- I'm sure everybody has heard this song. This is the first single off of the album. The title says it all: falling in love with somebody without even seeing them. A song to slow dance to. But, if you've listened to this song when it came out, you probably wouldn't wanna listen to it again. 8/10<br />4. The Best Thing- This is my fave up-tempo song on this CD. It has the perfect beat to compliment the lyrics. Darren says that the best thing about him is the person he's with. You'll definitely dance to this one. 10/10<br />5. Crash And Burn- This song starts off with \\"when you feel all alone...\\" and then turns into an inspirational song about someone always being there for you. Most of my friends bought the album just for this song. It's mid-tempo (think \\"I Knew I Loved You\\"), but has a positive message. 8/10<br />6. Chained To You- I instantly fell in love with this song when I first heard it. It has sorta like an 80's feel to it and it even mentions Madonna. It basically says \\"I'm connected to you, and I'm never gonna let go\\". 10/10<br />7. The Animal Song- Hmmmm. This track is interesting. It's actually featured on the soundtrack to \\"The Other Sister\\". This song starts off with bongo drums (somewhat annoying), but turns out pretty good. It talks about breaking free from the crazy stuff of the world. 10/10<br />8. The Lover After Me- This is a really sad song about breaking up and then realizing you want the person back. He sings about love lost and you can really feel the emotion in his voice. It has a pace similar to \\"Crash and Burn\\". 9/10<br />9. Two Bed And A Coffee Machine- The title may seem a little strange, but nothing is strange about this song. This is the most revealing song on the album. It talks about a mother in an abusive relationship that she has got to get out of. The piano adds a sad tone to the track and Darren's vocals are beautifully done. If anybody is in a relationship that turns physical, listen to this song. I think it will encourage you to do the right thing. This song is reminiscent of Aaliyah's \\"Never No More\\"... RIP Babygurl 10/10<br />10. You Can Still Be Free- A haunting song about \\"spreading your wings\\" and \\"taking to flight\\". The beat is sparse and is hinting that you should listen to the lyrics. Beautiful, beautiful song. 10/10<br />11. Gunning Down Roamnce- MY FAVE SONG ON THIS CD!!! I swear, everyday, I am humming the chorus to this song. This is the darkest song they have made, in my opinion. The production is solid and Darren's vocals are superb. This is the longest song on the album and I'm glad it is. This song tells of a love gone wrong. If Savage Garden ever get back together, they need to make more songs like this one. My friends think I'm crazy for listening to this song all the time, but this song is brilliant. 11/10!!<br />If you want some good music that you can relate to for everyday things, then go out and buy this CD (check out Sky's CD, too). Buy 3 copies of this: 1 for your room, 1 for your car, and 1 just in case your friend steals one :p
B000063DS1|5.0|A classy, much needed upgrade of the original 2-disc set. The photos are stunning. The essay is well-done. The remaster's sound is excellent. And the energy of Band itself is so high, the wheel of my CD player almost caught fire. It certainly makes one mourn Richard and Rick's passing all the more. And if only Robbie had found a way to bury the broken arrow and play on with his mates... <br />Like the audience that witnessed the actual performance of Last Waltz ...(including my pal Moshe), purchasers will get considerably more than their money's worth.
6305648522|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorite films ever since I first saw it in 1990.It had a perfect musical score, great acting and a magical quality.It perfectly embodied various themes: love for the cinema, remenbrance of our past, love for our father and mother ,or significant figures. It tried to portray  remenbrance of that first significant adult love but in my opinion with less success. At the end of the movie you wondered why Elena , Toto's great love, had vanished.<BR>Now after watching the original director's cut I have to say that this is the real movie we should have seen. It's true that it is long, maybe too long, but now the storyline of Toto's great and eternal love for Elena is complete, it gives closure someway to this beautiful love story.In my opinion the final 20-25 minutes of this cut are simply magnificent, tears will probably come, watching two persons deal with facts that affected their lives forever.The movie is less magical but more realistic<BR>I hope the movie is rereleased in DVD in the USA with the two versions. You will truly enjoy it.
B00005JKGI|5.0|A snapshot of all things British:  Football, beer, Minis and getting one over on those Europeans where ever possible.  A classic film
0553381709|4.0|This is definitely one of the best series I've read in this genre.  It's realistic in that the family that has been presented to us as the 'hero' suffers very real and extensive tragedy and as another reviewer mentioned, it kind of hits you when it happens.<BR>I'm a little tired of the pornography though.  It seems to be getting more frequent as the series goes on.  I'm not offended by any of the language and, of course, rapes and normal sex are part of life especially in a 'medieval' setting.  But is it necessary to give graphic depictions of a character taking a leak by using the same words you would if he were raping someone?  It's a bit much.<br />I can't wait for the next book, I hate buying one when I know it will be a year for the next one.  Hopefully it won't be long.
B000009ED0|5.0|When Kid Rock showed up on the MTV radar in early 1998, plenty of people didn't know what to think. Is he rock? Country? Metal? Rap?<br />Yes! He's every one of those things plus more. Kid Rock and the Twisted Brown Trucker Band weave a half dozen musical gendre's into an excellent package. Citing everyone from Metallica, NWA, and Hank Williams as major influences, Kid Rock is at times obscene, and at times heart-wretching. <br />Every track on the CD is a winner, but here is the best of the best.<br />Bawitdaba: 9/10  This song is a huge, powerful, arena ANTHEM!!! Probably Kid's most recognizable song, it has pointless lyrics and a heavy, shout along chorus.<br />Cowboy: 8/10  A laid back, western flavored song. Funny video.<br />I Am The Bullgod: 9/10  This was the first single, it's catchy and fun, but like most of Kid Rocks songs, is just one long rant about himself.<br />Devil Without A Cause: 9/10  Pretty much just a rap song with a heavy chorus, I love the intro. Kid Rocks sidekick Joe C. co-stars on this one.<br />Wasting Time: 8/10  A good song, just something to kick back too.<br />F*ck Off!: 8/10 A very hard rap metal track, filled with curses, and co-starring the best rapper out there, Kid Rocks friend from Detroit, Eminem!<br />Only God Knows Why: 10/10  Best track on the CD, a heart warming power ballet. Something Kid Rock tried to do eight times on his next full length disc, \\"Cocky\\"<br />All in all, this is a tough CD to top, hope Kid Rocks 3rd CD can do better than the second.
0316666343|4.0|This was a wonderful book - full of emotion, suprise, and insight.  It captured me throughout although the story does tend to skip but then again that is what makes it real.  Susie is curious and sweet and the fact that she is able to reveal so much with her adolecent voice makes me positive that this book will become a classic.  The last sentence absoultely got me -I was reduced to tears.
B00006674X|4.0|Ending his days in Hollywood with the type of dramatic role he always craved, Elvis gives an ironic twist to his movie career. Though it is not a particularly profound film , Change Of Habit does represent a change of pace for Elvis. A drama instead of a comedy, this film featured only three songs. Elvis stars a Dr. John Carpenter, a professional man for the first time in his career. Dr. Carpenter heads a clinic in a ghetto area of a major metropolitan area. He is suprised to be offered assitance by three woman. Unknown to him, the three are nuns in street clothing who are on a \\"secret\\" mission to aid the community but are afraid the local residents might be reluctant to seek hekp if their true identities were known. Dr. Carpenter falls in love with Sister Michelle Gallagher (Mary Tyler Moore) but her true vocation remains unknown to him. Sister Michelle also has feelings for Dr. Carpenter but is reluctant to leave the order. The film concludes with Sister Michelle entering a church to pray for guidance to make her choice - the church or Dr. Carpenter.<br />Unfortunately, by this time, Elvis had lost his lack of interest in pursuing a film career and had let his film contracts expire. He was eagerly awaiting his freedom to return to live performances.<br />It's interesting to note the cast in this film. Mary Tyler Moore who had success in the Dick Van Dyke show and her own series The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Ed Asner who co-stared on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Jane Elliot (Sister Barbara Bennett) is now a well know soap opera star. Darlene Love who was a member of The Blossoms singing group that backed Elvis on his 1968 NBC TV Special and later played Danny Glover's wife in Lethal Weapon plays one of the backup singers in this film.<br />Produced for Universal Pictures by Joe Connelly. Released November 10, 1969. Color.

0451191153|5.0|Having read this book several times, I always enjoy the excellent writing, nuanced characters and great plot. All of the characters are very interesting, nuanced and complicated. You'll cheer for Howard Roark as he masters his art and his struggle to understand the world around him. You'll wonder if Dominque Francon will learn that the evil of the world isn't \\"Satan with a sword but a lout on a stool.\\" You'll watch in horror as Peter Keating as he sells off piece by piece of his soul and Gail Wyland, the powerful newspaper magnate, learns the price for all of his power. As courageously as Steve Mallory and Austin Heller try to save their world from evil, you'll be bewildered by Alvah Scralet's cluelessness. An lastly, the cunning, conniving Ellsworth Toohey - what a great villain. May look like a plucked chicken but he makes taking over the world seem as easy as signing your name. Watch how he destroys people, corrupts the government, levels great art work into dust and strives to take over Gail Wyland's empire but is he any match for Howard? You'll have to read the book to find out.<br />Of course, there are Mrs. Rand's ideas. Agree with them or not this book will entertain as it provides food for thought and loads of topics for conversation.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series was excellent and HBO did a very good job all this movie contains is history. They were all apart of the 101st airbourne infantry division and they did alot in WW2. I think this is all the more greater because it is on DVD. You have to like that the sound and picture quality that comes with DVD instead of watching VHS where you have to worry about tracking and the picture stinking. If you can get a surround sound system, because it will knock you off your socks.
B00000163G|5.0|2Pac, y'all now him, slain Gangsta Rap star from the westcoast.<BR>Put out this album in 1996, the first ever double album rap cd ever. Now this release is near perfection, i just can't give it 5 mics, cause this does have a few filler songs, Pac is my fav rap artist, and this was quite a release.  The first disc also outshines the second disc, also way i can't give it 5 mics, anyways great album, if u just gettin into rap or tupac, pick this album up, u will not be disappointed, Pac's presence and emotion are untouchable i believe, I have had this cd for a long time now, and it still gets constant play from me, pick this up, should be in everyone's collection.
B00004XPQ2|5.0|Where does duty stop and to whom is it due?  These are some of the questions dealt with in this WWII film classic set in a prisoner-of-war camp in Burma.  The matter-of-factness of Alec Guinness is captivating as is William Holden's vacillation between honor and trickery.<br />The prisoners are directed to build a bridge for the Japanese army.  Told that all prisoners will work, Guinness points out the articles in the Geneva Convention that expressly forbid officers from working anything other than administrative chores.  The camp commander refuses to comply and thus begins the battle of wills between them.  The commander has his duty to his superiors, just as Guinness has his duty to the commander, to his country, and to his men.  He does not see the problem of these conflicting duties until it is too late.<br />Holden is an American who is just trying to go home.  After a daring escape, he winds up \\"volunteering\\" to return to the POW camp.  Although he just wants to go home, he sense of duty pushes him back.<br />I would recommend seeing this film.
B00005JKTF|4.0|CHARLOTTE GRAY -- the movie -- is not high art, merely entertaining. This film is not THE ENGLISH PATIENT, although some scenes remind me of that &quot;other&quot; WWII film (why do Hollywood Nazis always look so glam?). The cast of CHARLOTTE GRAY is wonderful -- Cate Blanchett plays a Scots woman who travels undercover to France to work for the British and their Allies when her pilot boyfriend is shot down; Billy Crudup plays as a French resistance fighter who is a peacetime communist; Michael Gambon plays Crudup's father, a disapproving French farmer with a &quot;past&quot;.<br />The script drags in a few places because there are too many plot elements and some of them are not fully developed. Supposedly, the film is based on a book which would explain the loose ends that could not be brought to closure in a standard length film. I have not been able to locate the book to clear up the confusion, but it seems the screenwriter who translated the book to the film version might have been forced to sacrifice detail critical to the integrity of the story.<br />The cinematograpy is beautiful. For example, the opening shots of a train carrying Charlotte Gray through the lavendar fields of southern France verge the sublime. I bought the DVD and saw the film on the small screen. I imagine scenes such as the train shots were stunning on the big screen.
6300214826|5.0|This masterful adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is an intriguing look into the mind confronted with madness.  As Martin Sheen's Cpt. Willard tells us, the story is about his journey as well as about Marlon Brando's Col. Kurtz.  The story takes place in Vietnam and Cambodia during the war rather than in Africa.<br />The scenes Coppola gives us are unnerving.  The way Brando fades in and out of darkness, and eventually Sheen, creates in us an almost physical response to their touch with madness.  Are these characters mad or are they giving a sane reaction to the madness in their surroundings?  Everyone is trying to survive the horror of the war, but by embracing that horror, these two characters somehow make some sense of it themselves.<br />This is an intense film, and I highly recommend it.
B0000028UK|5.0|After Ten there was Versus. Second Pearl Jam impact, their commercial most sucessful album and in my humble opinion, their best. I know, Ten is fantastic, and Vs. doesn`t have so much powerfull songs. But Vs. is crafted with such perfection and love....songs follow in great order and you can listen to whole CD without having to skip anything-after Go, a fantastic hysterical song of begging, and Animal, subtle song about the group (Five against one...), there is Daughter, a song with sad lyrics but cheerful melody (a contrast often found in PJ songs), wich has earned popular status among fans and general public. Glorified G is Vedder political attempt, and after Dissident, WMA and Blood, three great songs, but not fantastic, there is RVM aka. Rearviewmirror (one of the best songs on this record) about letting go, is a blow-out, extremely powerfull and Vedder`s voice is brilliant. Rats is somewhat funky song with great lyrics and Leash is a hymn to youth who don`t want to be trapped in a relationship. But, there are two songs out there waiting, that are worth this record alone. First is Eldery Woman..., touching, beautiful love song about reunited lovers, and second is Indifference, a ballad of pure genious, an ode to  depression and being alone...so light a match this morning and listen to Vs., album of contrasts, one of the greatest grunge records...and hear the difference, not indifference. Fantastic.
0066620996|5.0|I took the recommendation of a previous reader/reviewer and first read &quot;Good To Great&quot; by Collins for the &quot;do it now&quot; aspects of leadership and then read &quot;West Point..&quot; by Remick for the &quot;understanding why&quot; aspects of it and, maybe it's not for everyone, but, it worked for me. The Collins book tells you how to go from good to great, the Remick book tells you how to stay great by being &quot;Good&quot; ---- a different kind of &quot;Good&quot;.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you didn't see this fantastic series on HBO, do yourself a favor and order these DVDs. The series is superb. You get to know the characters and live what they live right along with them. This was one I was sorry to see end. Can't wait to own this DVD set for my own.
6301972139|5.0|When you compare this film with the current remake you must wonder why the remake.  It will be a real loss to the community of those who collect great films if this is not made available on DVD.  What must one do to encourage the DVD effort?
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright is certainly a rarity these days.  He does not do as his contemporaries do...he is not content to merely shout/chant with a musical accompaniment in the background.  He actually SINGS.  This CD is excellent.  I look forward to many more from Rufus.
B00005U11Z|5.0|The picture and sound quality of this DVD is amazing. The only disapointment was how many times the view panned to \\"fans\\" who didnt even know the words to probably the most popular songs of our time! Also, some... had a British flag. (This band is from San Francisco!) anyway, Steve hung the british flag on an amp and I wonder how many of those... yuppy \\"fans\\" probably thought that Journey is from the UK. Steve Augeri is an amazing replacement for Perry, in fact better. The band as a whole has never sounded better.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers takes everything that was good about Saving Private Ryan, takes out the Hollywood emotions, and gives a real, historical, story about a group of men struggling to stay alive. Watching the series unfold was true excitement - not a single plot-line seems unneccessary or stupid, all the performances were incredible, and the action sequences were dead-on. The story is an incredible retelling of what life was like for the paratroopers. From its first cautious moments in boot camp to its last disturbing images of a concentration camp, this series is absolutely wonderful. This is a must-buy for anyone with the money to pay for it - you will not be disappointed. 5 stars.
0140186409|5.0|When I first moved to Los Angeles, the majority population was White with fairly large Hispanic and Black minorities. Now the majority population is Hispanic, and I frequently find myself communicating with them in Spanish.<br />Look in any newspaper. All around the world, large masses of people are on the move: Albanians to Italy, Serbs to Hungary, Rwandans to Zaire, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to Britain, Algerians to France, and so on. Every year, the number of people in refugee camps grows; and the resources of nations are stretched to the limit to accommodate the influx.<br />In America, we've had our own migrations: from the original 13 Colonies to the West, Blacks from the South to Northern industrial cities after World War II, and the Okies to California during the Depression.<br />My point is that Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH discusses a very contemporary phenomenon with compassion and great artistry. His Joad family can just as easily be Mexican \\"Wetbacks\\" looking or a better life in the same places where the Joads went (Arvin, the site of the FSA's Weedpatch Camp, is mostly Chicano today). How Steinbeck, a native Californian, came to side with the Okies against the corporate farmers and their hired deputies, and the townsfolk who supported them, is an interesting story in itself. Suffice it to say that no one was more sympathetic with the plight of the poor than Steinbeck, who at times comes across as an American Gorky.<br />There are other books that show equally great compassion. Steinbeck in this novel, however, rises to heights of poetry he was never to reach again. Tom Joad in this passage explains why he decided to become a labor organizer:<br />\\"Says one time he [Jim Casy, the preacher] went out into the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul. Says a wilderness ain't no good , 'cause his little piece of a soul wasn't no good 'less it was with the rest, an' was whole. Funny how I remember. Didn' think I was even listenin'. But I know now a fella ain't no good alone.\\"<br />There are scenes, such as the description of the progress of a turtle seen by Tom as he walks down the long road home after being paroled, where you see as if in a magnifying glass the progress of untold thousands of farmers fleeing the drought of the Dust Bowl.<br />This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man. It takes the side of the hated, misunderstood outsider and sees poetry, goodness, a rough justice, and a tenacity that can move mountains.think I was even listenin'.

0812550706|5.0|I believe that saying that Ender's Game is &quot;The best book ever written&quot; should say it all, though even that doesn't do this one justice.  Though it is a Sci-Fi book, It is really a superbly written psychological tale about a young boy in tremendous circumstances.  This is by far the best book I've ever read, and I'd suggest it to anyone.  I've purchased 10 copies, and have given them all away.  I'm here for copy number 11.  <BR>(By the way, the entire series is great, but nothing compares with the original.)
0060922583|4.0|I read this book about seven years ago on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  I am not a scientist, nor have a background in any of the sciences except from school.  However, I found this book stimulating, insightful, validating, and easy enough to understand and grasp that I read the whole thing and came away with new insights about my own life and experiences.  <br />I did not expect to see new scientific information, but rather a new way of looking at recent scientific trends, and how it relates to the &quot;common man's experience&quot;, and this is exactly what I read.<br />I would only recommend this book to a serious student of life as it takes a certain level of curiosity to want to read a book with a scientific type of writing.

B00005JKCH|5.0|We Spidey fans awaited this film for years. Finally on May 3rd, the film hit theaters and I was in my seat with my eyes wide open. This movie did not disappoint. \\"Spider-Man\\" is a well though out, well crafted action-adventure movie starring Tobey Maguire as the title character. He does a phenomenal job at portraying the timid Peter Parker. He greatly balances the emotional and heroic sides of the character. Kirsten Dunst is Mary Jane Watson in this film and it isn't just because of the red hair. Willem Dafoe's performance as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin is as good, if not better, than Jack Nicholson's Joker in \\"Batman.\\" Even the film's supporting cast is exceptionally strong with James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rose Mary Harris as Aunt May, Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. The special effects are spectacular. The music and the score are also very good. The film has its hokey momements, but they're not what you'll remember about this film. Sam Raimi did what was thought impossible. He made a movie that did justice to Spider-Man.
B00001PE4D|3.0|With the title Cruel Intentions one might expect a darker, edgier movie this is light fare and almost comic at times.<BR>Poor little rich girl Kathryn does everything she can to keep her boyfriend sexually satisfied then is dumped for the virgin Cecile. Kathryns' response is to enlist the help of her step-brother Sebastian to relieve Cecile of her virginity.<BR>Sebastian is interested in relieving the new head masters' daughter, Annette, of her virginity before school resumes in the fall. Kathryn and Sebastian place a bet on the outcome of this endeavor; Annette remains a virgin and Sebastian loses his car to Kathryn, Annette loses her virginity and Kathryn has sex with Sebastian a hitherto unattainable goal.<BR>The usual negative aspect of having twenty somethings (Sarah Michelle Gellar/22 as  Kathryn Merteuil, Matthew Ryan Phillippe/25 as Sebastian Valmont, Reese Witherspoon/23 as Annette Hargrove, Selma Blair/27 as  Cecile Caldwell) playing high schoolers shows up.<BR>This film does not live up to its' potential, 3 stars for the effort put in by the actors.<BR>Trivia, Matthew Ryan Phillippe and his wife Reese Witherspoon became parents of a girl September of `99 the year the film was released. Selma Blair auditioned for the television role of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the part went to Sarah Michelle Gellar.
038533558X|4.0|Here is a book filled with mystery and intrigue. We enter the story from the point of view of Will Klein, a man for who tragedy seems to be following. He has just lost his mother to cancer and has had to deal with the disappearance and probably death of his brother, Ken, after he was accused of murdering Will's ex-girlfriend.<br />Harlan Coben sets the story up very nicely, passing Will's beliefs to us as if they were facts, which meant that every time Will was surprised by an unexpected turn of events, I was surprised right along with him.<br />For entertainment value, I thought Gone For Good certainly delivered. It's a fast-paced story with your standard heartless killers as the bad guys, up against a nice-guy protagonist, who describes himself as a coward, working against the odds and his own self doubts to try to overcome them.
0805211063|5.0|I wish to offer a friendly retort to reviewer Bob Newman, who states how Kafka would share excerpts of this book with his colleagues and would laugh out loud uproariously - and how this fact demonstrates how distant the 20th-Century American malaise is so distant from that of the same time period in Austria-Hungary.  I would agree wih Newman that this is certainly a horrowing aspect of thetext; but it's also one that I participated in also while reading Harman's translation - first while reading the 5th Chapter, here titled &quot;At the Chairman's&quot; (where K. learns that his services as a surveyor are not even needed, but he was called anyway to the job due to a minor oversight, &quot;the minorest of minors&quot;, I believe the text reads).  I can just feel the steam rising from K.'s arrogantly-laden temple while listening to the hairman's explanation - first amused by it, then slowly becoming frustrated and probably even maddened ... funny stuff !!  Maybe I only find this funny because I've never been so unfortunate to have been caught in the crossfire of such an oversight at a Liscense Branch, Court Order, etc.  This scene is in no ways the climax of the text, but merely the beginning of the fall into the abyss for K.  I hope others reading my retort here are moved to read the text in its entirity.

0783225792|5.0|Casino is probably the best movie of the 1990's.  The three main characters are grotesque but sympathetic due to the superb performances of DeNiro, Stone and Pesci.  The story is how the mob took over Las Vegas and eventually lost it as told from the point of view of its footsoldiers.  Casino takes an intriguing story and wraps it around three fascinating characters.  The result is pure cinematic genius.<BR>  <BR>Sharon Stone plays a frighteningly realistic slut with a grudge to settle.  Her character maims the royal scam that the men are perpetrating.  She serves as the Helen in this film - so powerfuly desireable, that she destroys the men in her path.<BR>Pesci is the muscle man unafraid of anyone or anything.  But subject to all man's temptations.  His weaknesses of flesh are the eventual undoing of the main characters and serve as an admonition to all viewers.  <BR>The morality of this film is not the issue.  The relative morality is.  We are driven to contemplate our own values and how our hubristic tendencies force us to compromise our values.  We are left to question not wether we do, but to what extent and how that affects our lives.  Our most human dramas are writ large in this hyperbolic tale.  Its triumph is in the mirror that it holds to us.
0792844882|3.0|1 star or 5 stars, 1 star or 5 stars... I settled on 3 because I just can't tell if this film is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen, or one of the cleverest satires of recent years.  Elizabeth Berkley is either an egregious overactress who deserves to have an anti-career, or a brazenly self-aware scholar of camp who deserves our respect.  As Nomi, she veers from girlish friskiness to happy hysteria to mad hysteria to sad hysteria to frenzied stupidity.  An early scene where she shows off her dancing \\"talent\\" at a disco left me truly not knowing what to think.  Surely, I pondered, this must be a joke.  No one would dance so spastically, so archly, so much like a wild, pouty, untamed lionness.  At least not anyone who expected to be taken seriously as a dancer.  And no real-life observer could possibly be expected to respond, \\"WOW! She can really dance!\\" and not expect to be sprayed with beer shooting from the noses of the laughing bystanders.  OK, so Nomi is innocent? or is it just superdim? She doesn't know her social security number or next of kin - or is this mental lapse meant to be interpreted as some sort of breaking-with-the-past maneuver?   ...  <br />Gina Gershon is foxy, has lots of teeth, and has the attitude of someone who is pretty pleased with herself for snagging such an easy paycheck... If you like Gina, see her in the creepy and kinky \\"Bound\\" instead.
B00006CXSS|5.0|With stunning acting and excellent storytelling, Band of Brothers is spectacular, if not the best World War II film of all time. Band of Brothers excells in many ways but its greatest characteristic is the way it attatches you to its characters. From the first sargeants to the privates, the viewers get a sense that they have known the depicted soldiers for years and have a different opinion of each. Spanning ten episodes and over seven hours of high-quality video. The special effects are simply spectacular and a sense of fear and adrenaline is felt by all who experience it from their couches. Overall greatness. And if all else fails, it is worth atching simply because of the cameo by SNL's Jimmy Fallon.
3931141802|5.0|This book re-affirms for me, the power of photography.<br />It grants me permisssion to look at the world again  with fresh eyes, enjoying all that humanity and nature has to offer.<br />I find the images speak to me in a timeless manner and are a joy to  behold.<br />I am still surprised that it received such a cold reception when it was first published, but as a Gen Xer I geuss it was another world in those days.<br />Buy this book you'll not regret it.
6302101743|5.0|This is the best Cowboys and Dinosaurs film out there.The story was one Wllis O'Brien tried to get produced in the 30's without succes.Three and half decades later his protegee Harryhausen finally gets it made.In addition to the lovely Gila Golan it stared James Fransicus (TV's Mr. Novak) but upon it's initial release it was paired with an incompatable co-feature and released during the hieght of the 60's student protests.It's audience either failed to find it or was more interested in protesting than going to the movies.It was quickly pulled from theaters and considered a failure.Luckily it went quickly to television.The segment where the Cowboys rope Gwangi is particularly memerable.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As action/war time/military movie depictions go, particularly as portrayed by Hollywood past, this HBO mini-series has established a new benchmark in believability! Not tied to a particular 'scenario'of sorts, the way the scripting and cast meld together so well one actually feels their presence as if you were almost in the trenches with them.  When I initially watched the series as it first aired, I found myself glued not only to the action scenarios but to the personal lives of each individual in Easy Company. I personally believe this is one of the best-to-date war time mini-series ever produced. I truly look forward to its future DVD release.

0316666343|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" has a rather unique concept--telling the story through the eyes of a dead young girl in Heaven.  That concept alone made me decide to buy this book, and it was just as effective as I believed it would be.  The murder of Susie Salmon, the aftermath on her family and friends, and the hunt for her killer...all of these events are more powerful in this book than they would be in one written from the point of view of a living person.  <br />The plot is intriging, with a good mix of characters to keep it exciting, but not too many that you lose the heart of the story.  The book expertly unravels the complexities of Susie's family: The father who needs closure, the sister growing up as the \\"sister of the dead girl\\", the mother aching to flee, the baby brother trying to comprehend why his sister is gone.  This is not a 'great' book, but it is certainly worth reading.  It does not drag on; inner plot lines are explored but just to the right degree.  Times flies by, and the characters live their lives.  Give this one a try--it's a fairly easy read, even if it does make you cry...
B000002BDB|5.0|I already own three other Miles Davis Box Sets; the one with John Coltrane, the &quot;In A Silent Way&quot; Box Set and the &quot;Live At The Plugged Nickel 1965&quot; set. Of course, these three box sets are far more exciting than this one. With Coltrane you get &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, the first real 'Modal Jazz' album, the &quot;Plugged Nickel&quot; is really exciting and furiously loose hard bop and &quot;In A Silent Way&quot; is the beginnings of fusion. With all these things stacked up against it, what would a Hard Bop loving cat like myself find appealing in this collection of cool toned orchestrated music?<br />Well this is really GOOD cool jazz, not the lousy stuff you get on radio. Every album (even the not-so-good Quiet Nights) is really good. My favourite is the material that makes up Sketches of Spain. This album is just amazing. It is not really jazz or classical music, but is really great. <br />All in all a great box set; not just for the people who are into cool jazz but for hard boppers looking for a little distraction.
1567184855|5.0|I was raised in a religious family, but something didn't feel quite right in all those rules. I stopped going to church and doing anything religious for a time because I just felt like it wasn't the answer. <BR>On the other hand, I DID feel there was something that I needed in my life to balance everything else out, and that was my understanding of the meaning of life.<BR>I have spent several decades in this search for truth. Until now, no one had been able to answer my questions. From the very get-go, this book leaves you with wanting more. I read it in 4 sittings (and that's probably only because I have a child!). This book touches on everything you have always wanted to know including ghosts, intuition, child death, crippled people, personal guides (before I was afraid they were 'evil spirits in disguise),time between past lives, why we choose certain bodies, certain familes, and certain talents all the while maintaining our free will in life & our body. This books touches on the union bewteen the mind & soul, when the soul comes to the baby, and abortions. Of course as the title explains, the book elaborates on all aspects of what exactly happens from the time our body dies until (and if) we choose to take an other. <BR> This book is VERY conforting to those who :<BR>*feel a void in their lives<BR>*are searching for meaning <BR>*are depressed <BR>*have lost someone close<BR>****Please remember that all of the author's case stuies come from hypnotized subjects. If you don't *believe in* hypnotism, you'll find this a waste. <BR>This is an excellent book and I have recommended it to several of my clients( I am a Life Coach).<br />This book helped me to uncover my real priorites and get back to the *important* things in life. You won't regret buying this book!
B000068QY7|5.0|I've been an Oasis fan for about 3 months now.  I never really listened to their stuff too carefully and now I can't get enough of it.  Frankly, I don't really get the arguments against them...they sound too much like the Beatles, the Gallaghers are a-holes, blah, blah, blah...First off, they've been accused of sounding like the Beatles since they burst on the scene and that argument is growing old.  And anyways, although they may not be TOO original, Noel Gallagher is still one of the best songwriters of this rock generation.  As for the statement that they are pricks, well...maybe thats what the world needs.  Somebody's gotta be the bad guy.  (An interesting aside...although Oasis supposedly emulates the Beatles, they're attitudes towards the press and the like are more along the side of the Rolling Stones).  Maybe critics attitudes are influenced by the Galleghers attitudes themselves; remember, (not to compare bands) Led Zeppelin NEVER got good reviews and look how they ended up.<BR>Anyway, the album itself is top-notch:  \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" is one of their best ballads, and Noel's \\"Little by Little\\" and \\"She is Love\\" are also outstanding songs, but the best is the gut-wrenching \\"Force of Nature\\".  However, the biggest surprise is the new democratic Oasis highlighted by Liam's emergence as a very good songwriter; \\"Better Man\\" is a great rocker and \\"Songbird\\" is a beautiful song.  Also, Gem Archer and Andy Rich contribute a song apiece as well.<BR>All the [stuff] thats said about Oasis seems to keep them going...buy the album.
B00005TT77|3.0|There are some great songs on here, but some of them aren't performed all that brilliantly, which really is a pity. As has already been pointed out by others, the first half of this album is quite excellent and there are some very talented musicians (whose own music I love) playing some interesting covers of some interesting Beatles songs. The best thing about this album is probably the fact that it isn't trying to be a &quot;best of the Beatles&quot; cover album; instead they let some excellent musicians choose their favourite songs and interpret them in their own way. <br />For some of these artists this worked out brilliantly, and you end up with songs rather similar to the original with slight embellishments and an original richness due to the individual performer's unique style. Unfortunately, however, some of the songs have come across as little more than a power-chord, volume 11, or simplified version of the original. These musicians, while also being artists that I respect in their own right, have forgotten some of the most basic rules of performing covers: do it exactly the same or do it completely different but never remove the essence of the song or take away when you should just be adding.<br />Nevertheless, I do still think that it's an album worth having, even if you end up having to program your CD player to skip over the rotten apples.

0316666343|5.0|I'm a book worm and I saw such a big fuss about this title I got curious.<br />All I can say is wow! I laughed at times and cried at times. Even though the subject sounds so depressing - a young girl who is raped and murdered, I found the book anything but dark.<br />I especially found Lovely Bones comforting and optimistic. It is a great book for anyone who has loss anyone they loved. It handles grief and all that grief involves realistically but at times light heartedly. There is no over the top melodrama here.<br />Read the book. Let Susie tell you her story. After she is done you'll appreciate your family and life so much more.
B000066NW0|5.0|I thought Avril might be a one hit wonder, but this CD proved me wrong! Listening to the songs, the lyrics, you can tell she is more mature than her age. Her songs are all great-I never skip through the CD, because all the songs are worth listening to! My favourite songs are Complicated, Anything but Ordinary, Losing Grip, Mobile, and I'm With You. If you are having second thoughts on buying this CD,--don't!! It's well worth your money!
B0000640VO|5.0|Really...An excellent film. <br />The visuals are amazing, Jeunet really shows off his eye for directing, hopefully he can do more like this in the future and stay away from stinkers like Alien: Resurrection.<br />The humor works very well, quirky but charming, like the rest of the film. The bits like the minute details about the characters and their interactions are very humorous.<br />Which brings me to Amelie herself...Audrey Tautou is amazing, simply the most adorably cute actress ever. Her acting is well-done, the expressions and messages she conveys without speech are very eye-opening, close to the silent antics of Keaton or Chaplin.<br />Some might call it overstatement, but this is one of the best films ever. A must-see, especially now when the summer movie period is winding down and you need a break from the mindless action and popcorn movies out there. A must-own.

0736041850|5.0|This is the best reference book I have found for anyone interested in weight training.  It gives very specific information on which muscles are used in many many weight-lifting exercises and, especially helpful, in different variations of these exercises.  If you want to develop a routine that involves the different parts and aspects of a particular muscle group, this is a great place to look.  The information is presented in an easy-to-understand written form and also visually with beautiful illustrations.  I was very pleased to find that the illustrations include women's bodies as well as men's.  This book presents complex information (which I have found missing or difficult to understand in other books) in a straight-forward and well-organized manner.  The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish it had an index.  I'm really glad I found this book!

This book is worth treating yourself to in hardcover.
B00006ADG8|5.0|Billy Budd ranks as one of the greatest movies of all time. Melville's tale of good vs. evil receives flawless treatment from director Ustinov. Robert Ryan has never been better as the evil Claggert, who epitomizes unredeemable evil. Terence Stamp is perfectly cast as the uncorruptable Budd who wishes to see good in every man, even Claggert. The movie builds to an unforgettable climax and packs an emotional wallop like no other movie I have seen. This version of Billy Budd has been out of print for years. To have it back is a cause of celebration. Do yourself and your family a favor: watch it together. They surely don't make movies like this anymore!

In addition to holding him responsible for his own personal genre, we look to him for salvation from a sea of vapid &quot;rock&quot; music produced by coddled kids pretending to be stressed.  Bruce succeeds in providing our ears with a sincere album played by professional musicians.  Unfortunately, when measured by Bruce standards this album is not very good - despite the glowing reviews posted here by people unwilling to admit it.<br />Springsteen set out (however unintentionally) to do something incredibly ambitious.  Ask yourself, &quot;would I take an album of over a dozen rock songs about September 11th seriously if it were anyone but the Boss?&quot;  Obviously moved and suddenly prolific, Bruce offers us an album of music that needs less and more.  <br />From a songwriting perspective, Bruce is erratic albeit sincere.  At least 4 of the songs should have been thrown away in the studio (&quot;Empty Sky, &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot;, &quot;Further On Up the Road&quot;, &quot;Nothing Man&quot;).  Several others are filler.  There are a couple of tracks (&quot;Mary's Place, &quot;Into the Fire&quot;) that could be good with more attention to detail.  <br />Performance and production are mediocre.  Even if you can get past Bruce's wierd counry affectation, his vocal performance is mostly languid and dull.  If you don't believe me try listening to &quot;Adam Raised a Cain&quot; to remind yourself of just how the guy can deliver.  The arrangements sound like Mellencamp's band with a cameo or two by the Big Man.  The production is irritatingly bright and slick and obscures all of the sonic texture that makes the E Street Band so cool.  The organs, high register pianos, sax and bass are all buried underneath a jangle of guitars that sounds like the Travelling Wilbury's.  There is not much hooky or memorable.<br />The exception to all of the above is the quite excellent studio rendering of &quot;My City Of Ruins&quot;.  Buried on the end of 14 so so tracks, this is a welcome injection of Bruce Juice.  There is more soul in the first 4 bars of this track than all others combined.  The arrangement is better.  Production better.  In short, more thoughtful in every way.  There's the problem.  Bruce only needed one song to make his point.  He gave us 14.  And there was no one there to stop him.<br />Tell yourself it's great.  Enjoy it for a little while if only because it is not Creed or Staind or [insert name here].  But soon it will go into the pile and it will never make it into the player before &quot;Born to Run&quot; or &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;.  A classic this is not.
0553381709|5.0|I assume that if you're thinking about buying this book, you've already read the first two (if not, you want to start with \\"Game of Thrones\\"). So, I don't really need to say much other than if you liked the first two books, you will like this one, and if you didn't, you won't. Storm is as good as Game of Thrones, in my opinion. Very tightly plotted and paced, and all the unexpected twists we've come to love from Martin. The only character viewpoints I find a little less interesting is Davos and Stannis. Sansa thankfully begins to become more interesting and complex in this book. She seemed rather superficial in the early books, but she could turn out to be a very interesting character. Bran also shows promise and here he begins to discover his \\"special purpose\\" (he hates these cans!). We get to meet some interesting characters from beyond the wall and across the ocean, and there are hints that those regions in the southlands (Dorne) will be more important at some point.<br />The main thing I don't like about Martin's books is that they highlight just how weak Robert Jordan's writing has become by comparison. It's clear that Martin has a good editor that is not afraid to tell him when something is too slow or not important. Assuming you are not put off by somewhat frequent graphic descriptions of violence and sexuality, you will not be disappointed by this. I only worry that Martin has created such high expectations that his future books will be hard-pressed to meet the gold standard he has set. Waiting for the next book is going to be pure torture. I hate hardcovers but I might have to go there for book 4 (\\"A Feast for Crows\\"...sounds bloody, yay!).
0316666343|5.0|Six days from today will be the 9th anniversary of my mother's murder. Alice Sebold has shown a special insight on how this event initiates an entirely different \\"rest-of-your-life senario\\" for everyone close to the victim, especially the immediate family.  Sebold's clean, well-written prose clearly communicates the angst of just such a personal loss.  I was particularly moved by the the author's ability to empathize with the characters' pain (implied or indicated) of even considering the victim's fear and pain during the series of events leading to Suzie's death.  Susie's acceptance of her family's actions and the needs that prompted them was insightful and, to some who need to believe it, helpful.  At a time when certain books, movies, and newscasts still send my family and me unexpectedly reeling, this book was sometimes nostalgic, sometimes intensely painful, sometimes amusing and somehow comforting to my middle-aged soul.
0340738448|5.0|A Very Good Screenplay! Like it like the movie!
B00005S8FC|4.0|You'll never here a harpsichord sound so cool.  This French-Argentinian blend screams \\"pimp.\\"  The dance beats are good start to finish.  Sometimes they get off track with the higher-end sounds, but most of the time it compliments the South American beats which sway with a Grandfather-clock consistency.  You'll find yourself nodding, swaying or tapping without noticing--a hypnotic sound.<BR>Again, great percussion and the vocals, though scarce, are rewarding.  The female sounds sultry and the male forms a picture of an unshorn [bad guy.  Definite pick up.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This CD is a great one. I first heard &quot;WISH YOU WERE HERE&quot; on MTV. I thought &quot;I won't get that album. It's not hard enough, music-wise&quot; Next Christmas, I get it for a present. I think &quot;OH-BOY -*SHIGH*-&quot; I go listen to the fist track, &quot;NICE TO KNOW YOU&quot;, and it rocks as hard as all the other rock I know and love! If you thought the same, get this album. they have some really &quot;rockshuos&quot; CDs out there too.
0316666343|4.0|Although this novel began a bit slow, I thoroughly enjoyed the outcome.  Not very often does an author place the importance on the grieving family and town rather than the murderer.  Once the book began to pick up and the suspicions towards the murdering neighbor increased, I could not put this book down.  Overall, I suggest this reading.  And if you are impressed, then pick up Wally Lamb's &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; and be prepared to be blown away.
0679411585|5.0|As the son of a Vietnam Veteran, born in the 60s, I've tried to do as much reading on the subject as possible. I read this book when it first came out back in '93. This book is the best of the bunch. A vivid and harrowing account of what became America's \\"wake up\\" call that maybe we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into.<BR>Hats off to all who served and returned, and to those who didn't return.
B00003CY0V|5.0|While this movie used many of the formulaic conventions, i.e. car chases, nudity, and parent/child affection, to manipulate the audience and to entertain, I thought it did a masterful job of presenting a very poignant, current question: How far is too far, in the war against terror?<br />John Travolta's character is the bad guy, or is he really a good guy who is just willing to pay a higher price for freedom than I am?<br />I could not possibly care less about Halle Berry's figure, but at least she is not painful to watch in her acting. Hugh Jackman even carries his role well.<br />All in all, I was very pleased with this movie and recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates action/intrigue movies.
0553103547|3.0|George R.R. Marin is one of the finest and innovative authors to enter the sibling genres of science-fiction and fantasy in the last thirty years.  As rumors of his return from televistion writing blossomed into rumors of an epic high-fantasy series I became extremely excited.  If anyone, I thought, can revitalize this ailing genre it would be George R.R. Martin.  Although this series has indeed turned out to be a fresh look at the genre, true revitalization is still far away.<br />Martin does bring some adult sophistication to the genre.  His characters are not one-dimensional, and are not \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\"  Unfortunately, he has difficulty sustaining this.  There are characters that we are supposed to like, and characters that we are supposed to dislike.  To create this Martin has slumped to the classic high-fantasy trick of giving us \\"good guys\\" who \\"really care about the little people,\\" whom we never really see, and are never cared about as a whole (e.g. \\"I'm not going to tax them as much this year), but only as individuals.  The \\"bad guys\\" are all sharp-witted and care only about themselves, and somehow have managed to concoct far-fetched ideas of how to better their personal situation.  Although, each character appears to be a unique and complex individual at the beginning, by the half-way point they have become formulaic.  Every character has only one way of speaking, and only one topic to talk about, and it becomes tiresome and boring quickly.<br />These critical comments should, however, be put into perspective.  While Martin's series cannot stand out among good literature, it definitely can -- and does -- stand out among good high-fantasy literature.  So, if you have not yet become disillusioned about the genre, you may find this new series worth your time.  I still think, though, that you will find it difficult to make it all the way through the six proposed volumes before becoming tired of the series -- and the genre.
B00000BKI4|5.0|In 1998, Mercury Rev ditched the psychadelic indie-rock and took up this. Featuring experimental pop songs with passion and sadness, Deserter's Songs is the best Mercury Rev record out there. Opening with the magnificent, epic `Holes' which is beautiful and dreamy, all blissful strings and fragile vocals. Equally good is the uplifting dream world of Opus 40, an intoxicating perfect pop song with beautiful melodies and a big chorus. Some of these songs really are beyond words, impossible to describe in mere words, just a mood that only a song could create.<br />For another standout, seek out `Goddess on A Hiway': a downbeat verse with a simple yet effective tune and rhythmic piano and bass, suddenly rushing into a heartbreaking, epic, huge chorus of `And I know it ain't gonna last', all horns and strings and guitars creating a magnificent, larger than life sound.<br />These are perfect pop songs: not like horrible pop, but wonderfully experimental and beautiful: uplifting one moment and swimming with sadness the next, sometimes both at once. The horns, flutes and strings provide fantastic accompaniment to Jonathan's distinctive, high pitched, beautifully delicate voice. This could never be the falsetto of Thom Yorke, Chris Martin, or any similar British indie movers and shakers, but is quite clearly his own. Mercury Rev are American, but have more of a fanbase in Britain than in their native country. <br />In fact, though, this CD is full of old American influences, dug out from the bands' vinyl collections, long forgotten by all others but beautifully restored to life by this band. For proof, check out `The Hudson Line', the only song with lead vocals by guitarist Grasshopper, a driving, rhythmic bluesy track with an intoxicating, jazzy rhythm section and wild saxophone and guitar solos. Or `Tonite It Shows', a dreamy ballad that could have been lifted from any decade in American music between the 40s and the 90s. <br />Another dreamy track is `Endlessly', with itsacoustic guitar arpeggios, choral singing, harp and horns. This sounds like it could have been taken from an old movie soundtrack and is touching. The Funny Bird also opens with the mood of movie music, but the vocals which enter have an effect on them which makes them sound experimental and lend a new mood. The track morphs round and round and is possibly the most ambitious song on the album, featuring huge strings accompaniments, yet also guitars, cymbal crashes and walking bass. This is fantastic stuff.<br />Stranger still is closer `Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp', beginning with harpsichord, then adding horns and a thudding bass and drum rhythm that could have been taken from a dance track, and country-style acoustic guitar. There is a bit of piano showmanship, and `stomp' describes the track very accurately.<br />The other three tracks are instrumentals: `I Collect Coins', `The Happy End (The Drunk Room)' and `Pick Up If You're There'. The first two of these both sound like old recordings: `I Collect Coins' being a piano and horn piece that deliberately crackles like an old record and could easily have come out of the 30s or 40s, and `The Happy End' being an unnerving, slightly sinister, somewhat discordant piece, which again sounds very old and is difficult to listen to. `Pick Up If You're There' sounds like modern soundtrack music to a film in a quiet but creepy bit, all sinister keyboard chords and quiet organ, joined by strings about halfway through.<br />One thing Mercury Rev are brilliant at is creating moods. Even in the instrumentals which lack Jonathan's fantastic lyrics, moods are conveyed and feelings and styles penetrate right into the listener's brain, even if they are difficult to put into words. Mercury Rev can paints soundscapes with their music, a true gift, and here is a CD full of fantastic, beautiful tracks whose feeling shines through. Wonderful. 5 stars.
B0000640VN|3.0|This could have been an awful movie.  It almost was.  This literalization of the fantasy of being swept away by a Real Gentleman (dressed in gold lace, on a white horse, no less!) is painfully hokey sometimes.  The ostensible moral of the movie, that if you just love a gorgeous man enough to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge for him (again, literally!) you'll find true happiness, is one that too many women have already taken to heart.  And the science-fiction machinery is just plain embarassing.<br />BUT there are three great performances in the movie.  Jackman is wonderful.  You really do get the sense of a Real Gentleman from him.  For a movie that regularly goes over the top, Jackman's encounter with the modern world is surprisingly nuanced and low-key -- he's a scientist of sorts, an inventer, and his delight in seeing how things work is really wonderful.  As is his incredulous dismay at how badly toasters work:  one toasting barely warms the bread & two burns it.  (There's a quick throwaway shot a bit later of a toaster he's jury-rigged to toast perfectly.)  When he's tipsy and tells Meg Ryan's boss and would-be seducer that he's a cad and a serpent, you actually believe, not only that a man would talk like that, but that another man would be taken aback and reconsider his life when he heard it.<br />The second great performance is by Breckin Meyer, as Ryan's brother.  He does a wonderful job of portraying a manic young man who vexes people in hopes of making them like him.  There's great chemistry in the scenes between him and Jackman, as Jackman teaches him a thing or two about how to approach women.  The two of them sparkle together (much more than Jackman and Ryan ever do.)<br />The third great performance was by Schreiber, who -- with the help of some magnificent directing -- does a wonderful job at the beginning of the movie, as a 21st Century man prowling about late 19th Century America, and appearing subtly, weirdly, surreally out of place. You don't reallyknow why Jackman is fascinated by him in the opening scenes, but you're fascinated too.  And the scenes between the two when Schreiber inadvertently brings him forward in time with him are wonderfully done.<br />Meg Ryan on the other hand, is more of a place-holder in this than an interesting character.  She's done much better work.<br />The three great performances keep this from being an awful movie, but they can't quite it a success.  The end is too disappointing.  The movie parodies itself throughout, but that only makes the final descent into improbable schmaltz that much more painful -- you can tell that even the director doesn't believe in it, so why should you?  The characters all suddenly lose their shape.  Why should the self-absorbed Schreiber suddenly go to great lengths to try to make other people happy?  Why should Meg Ryan believe him when he tells her to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge?  Why does Meyer go along with it?  Under what conceivable circumstances would any duke, let alone a Real Gentleman, have announced his choice of a bride in public, in the presence of all contenders, as if announcing the winner of a raffle? <BR>  <BR>So -- this movie wavered between being a great movie, and being a dreadful one, but it never quite managed to be either.  It's not a bad cosy, Sunday-afternoon cuddle movie.  But you might want to switch it off before the end.
B00005M989|1.0|Don't waste your money on THE VERY BEST OF PRINCE, its just a cash cow for Warner who wanted to milk more money from Prince. If you want a comprehensive Prince collection, get 1993's THE HITS/THE BSIDES (3 cd set), but if you don't want to shell out that much money, buy the separate discs THE HITS 1 or THE HITS 2 (or both). All of the songs that are on here (except Money Don't Matter 2Night) are on those cds, so you're just buying the same cd really if you buy this one. You can find a much better collection than this one.
B000002MU3|5.0|I stayed away from this album during its original released, but wow, what was i thinking? This album is a great solid effort from R.E.M. and is my personal favorite. I recently bought the vinyl edition as well and it sounded great! You could tell that the band was trying something fresh after &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;. This is an important album because it is the one that goes unoticed by mainstream fans, but to the hardcore R.E.M. fans is one of the best. &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; is worth the entire price of the Album. Michael Stipe's passionate vocals give me chills everytime i listen to it. The album is a disoriented mess, which makes it that much more fun to listen to! This is a very undervalued Album and one that deserves more recognition. I personally feel this album was the best pure rock album of late 1993- early 1994 and was a breath of fresh air from the slower paced alternative rock that was being played non stop. A definate MUST for any fan of 90's rock music and fan's of R.E.M. who stayed away from it the first time.

B0000542DJ|5.0|It took many years for someone to finally let Jim Garrison's story be told in the proper and right way. For years, Jim was bashed and destroyed by the federal government and media. However after viewing this movie, one can't help but finally give Jim Garrison the credit he deserved for having the courage and guts to bring the jfk assasination to trial. There are alot of people who to this day question Jim, but as years pass, it is proven more and more that he was right in his theory of a conspiracy to kill the president. This movie is based on Jim Garrison's book \\"On The TraiL Of The Assasins\\" and also on Jim Marrs book \\"Crossfire: The Plot to Kill Kennedy\\". Once you view this movie, i suggest you read those 2 books and i'm sure you'll have all the facts you need. The special edition DVD includes many special features including the \\"new documents\\" which further proves Jim's theory. Jim Garrison was a very special man and Oliver Stone knew this and finally let Jim fight back against the people that belived his investigation was a fraud. Those people eat there words more and more as years go by. God Bless Jim Garrison, and God Bless You Oliver Stone!, for having enough courage to make this movie!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I have rewound the VCR tape so often, I lost count.  Beauty and the Beast is a movie that you will get lost in an forget what's going on around you.  It reassures you that their is always hope and love always prevails! I'm excited that they are now putting it on DVD! It took long enough!!!!
B000002LFU|4.0|Green is a very confusing album to say the least. it seems as if Michael Stipe and the band are trying to continue it's political views, but can't figure out how to say them on a major release. However, the album is a very FUN album and holds up well even today. I always take this cd in the car with me and blast it. The sound is still very fresh. &quot;Pop Song '89&quot; is a definate &quot;Doors&quot; sounding song in a lyrical way. &quot;Stand&quot; is the song most casual fans think of when they think of R.E.M.. I suggest that if you're a causal fan of the band, and are afraid to try the earlier works, then this is the album to get you started, as it is a very easy album to grasp and understand. This album doesn't know what it wants to be and therefore makes it more fun to try and figure out where it stands among the R.E.M. catalog.
0137549202|4.0|I used the author's book &quot;Digital Signal Processing&quot; in my college study, and I also read and cite the 1st Edition of <BR>&quot;Discrete-Time Signal Processing&quot; during my work experience. That's a very good reference. But I don't have the <BR>2nd Edititon.<br />    However, after going through the Table Of Contents of the 2nd Edition of &quot;Discrete-Time Signal Processing&quot;, I <BR>think Oppenheim&amp;Schafer did a resaonable tradeoff to reflect state of the art in DSP domain.<br />    They add: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) which is mostly used in image compression, Multirate Signal <BR>Processing which is used widely in modern DSP, and Oversampling and Noise Shaping Sampling for A/D and D/A <BR>conversion.<br />    In consequence, they remove: Lattice Structure, IIR Filters Design, Cepstrum Analysis (often used in speech <BR>signal processing) and Homomorphic Signal Processing, which are a bit sophisticated. And I guess the reason to <BR>remove IIR Filter Dsign is there exists many computer-aided tools on digital filter design, and made this very easy.
B000006UNG|5.0|They say the third time is a real charm ! This 3rd release by Talk Talk in the mid 80's showed artistic maturity and lyrical growth. No longer was Talk Talk heavily relying on synthesizers and drum machines as on their first and second albums. Instead of following the typical commercial route of many now defunct 80's new wave and pop groups The Colour of Spring has an acoustical feel and a classical backdrop as noted on the sparse track April 5th. Listen carefully to certain tracks with the wonderful piano, classical guitar, and soprano sax arrangements adding to the rich flavor.  Also, there's a hint of pre-alternative ingredients in the mix. Melodies are indeed introspective in nature while Mark Hollis' vocals are warm in an almost crooning manner. The catchy upbeat acoustical semi-bluesy tune Livin' In Another World is one of the album's best tracks with Hammond organ and harmonica to boot ! Track 8 Time It's Time is a swaying melodic yet haunting tune that properly closes out the set backed up by a choir known as Ambrosia. This track resembles something that could have been written by the Alan Parsons Project or Roxy Music a few years prior. The percussion on the entire album feels and sounds organic. There may only be 8 short tracks;however, they are abundant in music and lyrics ! Talk Talk was ahead of it's time with this release !...
B000069HKH|1.0|I was eager to hear Bruce Springsteens new material, boy was I ever in for a dissapointment. This self-serving album is designed to let us know just how important Bruce is, not only in the music world, but in the world as a whole. Give me a break! In his prime Bruce was outstanding because while crafting some of the most beautiful songs about everyday life and its struggles, he never took himself too seriously. Now he wants to be Bono. The difference is: Bono is involved in politics because that is something he truly believes in, while Springsteen is involved because he has an inflated ego. He wants to be the national spokesman for the brokenhearted, our voice in a time of madness, but he is too obvious in his message, it comes across as forced. It's great to see the E-Street Band back with him, but their talents are wasted on this boring turkey. Unfortunately for Springsteen he is so far removed from the source material that made his earlier material so great, he sees the world differently, and has fallen out of touch with Mainstream America. Bruce needs to fade away like a bad dream.
B00005RDSM|5.0|My almost-3-year-old LOVES this movie. He pretends that he is Peter Pan and I am Wendy. We watched it just before going to Disneyland, and we were so glad... much of the park refers to the movie. <br />It's a great show that has been all but forgotten by the current generation.
630460291X|4.0|Considering that I've actually seen DVDs selling for a ridiculous [amount] here, the price of this one is quite reasonable for DVDs sold in North America (you can get top quality DVDs in China for [money]). However, the ones who put this DVD together didn't do everything for you. For such an excellent movie, you don't get much on the DVD. You have to flip it over, because half the movie is on one side and half on the other. And, unlike the VHS, this one doesn't include the Bryan Adams music video of \\"Everything I Do\\", one of the Top 5 selling singles of English Pop Music in the 1990s. The resolution, though pretty good, is sub-standard for DVD and the sound gets distorted if you turn up the volume. An excellent movie but a bad DVD release.
0316666343|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. If you ever have lost a loved one in your family you can relate to anyone in the book about coming to terms with someone's death. I thought the narration from above was great watching each one in her family deal with death and get on with life. This is a great book to read. Don't pay attention to those other reviews that want you to get deeper. Just read it and enjoy!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Another great Lips vehicle, but one song, as great as it is, is too distracting for me to listen to. Whereas most Lips songs are sweetly downbeat, Fight Test is actually an UPBEAT cover of Cat Stevens' Father and Son.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing an exciting action film, maybe with not much plot, but at least some kick [bottom] action scenes. Instead, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider graced me with nothing much more than excessive [breast] shots of Angelina Jolie's stuffed bra. The story was just not interesting, weak at best, and there was nowhere near enough action scenes to keep me hooked into this movie. Even Lara Croft's semi-romance interest was nothing much to look at. I can't believe they're making a sequel of this non movie. I would much rather play the video game. Watch the Indiana Jones movies for great action, or even more recent films like the Matrix. At least they don't disappoint. The only really good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Next to Blackadder, the Fawlty Towers series is by far my favorite television series of all time, the brainchild of the amazingly talented John Cleese. If you have never seen the show before, this is an amazing package to have, and it is something you will watch over and over again. The show is timeless.<br />The DVD package gives you lots of nice extras, with interviews (old and new) with the main cast members, as well as a neat little cast and setting guide. One thing I never liked about the VHS issues was the picture quality, which was quite grainy. The DVD spruces up all the video and sounds, so the performance is optimal. The price is also quite reasonable, so value for money is assured.<br />Only 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers were ever made, and they are all in this package. It showcases the wit and charm of John Cleese, who plays an obnoxious hotel owner who does with several problems with guests. Believe it or not, it was inspired by a real hotel in England. The writing is razor sharp, and unlike most comedy shows, the jokes never get old. My favorite episode is &quot;The Germans&quot;, with perhaps the best punch line  I have ever heard on a TV show (I won't spoil it, but it has something to do with who started the war).<br />The Fawlty Towers DVD set is an essential part of my DVD collection, right beside the Blackadder DVD set. Even people who don't like Britcoms will love Fawlty Towers, and will go back to it over and over again, as I do.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is among the best rock albums ever made.  Snotty, rude and obnoxious the Sex Pistols came on the scene in mid '70s London.  Rejecting the \\"arena rock\\" and the overproduced music being created, they followed the Ramones and stripped it down to the essentials.<br />And for them the essentials consisted of anger mixed with surprisingly tuneful music.  From Holidays in the Sun to EMI everysong is an attack on someone or something in the establishment.<br />In the end the Sex Pistols lived up to their image and self-destructed.  Fitting I guess, but unfortunate for the rest of us.  Never Mind the Bullocks belongs in everyones CD collection.
B000069CWE|5.0|Being a 34-yr-old mother whose 2 favorite groups are Chicago and Metallica, I'm sure I'm not a typical LP fan.  After hearing that this was a rap style remix album I almost didn't buy it, but at the last minute I decided to give it a try since Hybrid Theory is one of my favorite albums (try fighting with a 5 yr-old for control of the minivan's CD player!)<br />I'm glad I took the chance because the remix of Pushing Me Away alone was worth the price.  It is haunting.  All the others vary in their quality from excellent to too close to the original, but none are bad.  <br />This is a enjoyable variation of a group that is already unique.  It's a nice piece of work to hold me over until their new studio album comes out.
B000067CPX|5.0|I've been a RHCP fan since 1990. Their music has changed since then, so I can understand that a Chili Pepper fan from the 80's and 90's wouldn't like this CD as much as their older ones. Then again, almost EVERY band's style evolves as they mature and get older. The Beatles, The Who, Rolling Stones, KISS, Led Zeppelin, they all progressed and evolved over the years.<br />Anyway, back to the Chili Peppers. My opinion is biased because they're my favorite band. They don't do as much as the hardcore punk, funk, rap, rock thing like in Blood Sugar Sex Magic. They do a lot more melodic singing. Songs are great as well as the instrumentation. This CD is closer to the style of Californication. It's all good in my book.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I am a compulsive CD buyer, so I have many CD's with just one or two songs I like.  This CD is the complete opposite.  I have not taken out of my CD player since I bought it and I can play it through again and again and never skip over songs.  Every single one is great and I love his lyrics.  If you want a good investment CD that you will wear out, I highly recommend it.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Everyone is dead and in hell.  The guy behind Winkies is the gatekeeper.  It all starts in the 40s.  Who in this day and age names their kids &quot;Betty&quot; or &quot;Rita&quot;?  Don't try to read into the movie.
B000002OX7|5.0|I once read a critic describe &quot;Who's Next&quot; as the best pure Rock album ever made.  It's hard to argue against that.  This hasn't aged a bit in my opinion.  It's still vital and alive today and has become the music of more than one generation.<br />&quot;Who's Next&quot; has it all- Townshend's guitar work, Entwistle's bass, Moon's drumming and Daltrey's vocals (that scream  on &quot;Won't Geet Fooled Again&quot;).  This is one of the indispensible Who albums to own (the others being &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;).<br />From &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; to &quot;We Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;, &quot;Who's Next&quot; is a masterpiece of Rock.
B00000DFRS|5.0|Whitney has had bigger hit albums, and those also had more memorable tracks, but this is hands down her best album.<br />It's Not Right, But It's Okay-  a funky tune, about a woman who catches her man cheating.  This track grows on you the more you listen.  The remix is far more catchy and superior, though.  B-<br />Heartbreak Hotel-  a very good modern-day R&B tune, which is sung by Whitney, Faith Evans, and Kelly Price.  It was surprisingly the biggest hit on the album, but a very good track by anyone's standards.  I like it a lot.  B<br />My Love Is Your Love-  a fun and uplifting song, which is a little on the religious song, but one of the strongest songs on the album.  Irresistibly catchy too.  A-<br />When You Believe-  a would-be smash movie ballad she sang with Mariah Carey.  It is actually pretty good, but not the runaway movie theme it was supposed to be.  Kinda formulaic as well.  C+<br />If I Told You That-  it seems like a weird choice when you first hear it, but it's better with every listen.  A lot like the assertive R&B you heard from singers like Brandy at that time.  B<br />In My Business-  an okay song.  It's a song that reflects Whitney's irritability with the media talking her and Bobby down.  Missy Elliot is featured, but she seems too out of place on the song.  C<br />I Learned From The Best-  my favorite song on the whole album.  It's got a jazz sound to it, and she sounds highly soulful on this track.  Her voice is incredible on this song.  A<br />Oh Yes-  my least favorite song on the CD.  Extremely slow, and at nearly 7 minutes, it feels like this song will never end.  But still, this song does have some good points to it.  C<br />Get It Back-  alright, but its honestly the only song that I forget.  It isn't very catchy.  C+<br />Until You Come Back-  this song has great promise, and had the potential to be a great power ballad, but it's a little too generic.  B-<br />I Bow Out-  It's a great song.  Whitney is her best \\"bitchy diva\\" in this song.  I love it.  A-<br />You'll Never Stand Alone-  One of the best tracks on the CD.  I think this should have been released as a single.  It's traditional Whitney Houston (on the same page as \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and \\"The Greatest Love Of All\\")  A<br />I Was Made To Love Him-  I thought this cover was a good track, though it seemed like a bad way to end the album.  Ending with \\"You'll Never Stand Alone\\" would have been a perfect ending.  B<br />Whitney is at her soulful best on this album.  It seems a tad rushed at times, and doesn't have the standards like her other albums, but that's what makes this album so great.  It's spontaneous, and all the tracks are well done.
B000002UAX|2.0|It brings back great memories. We landed on the moon and then Sgt. Pepper. Roomers going round that Paul was dead, That this was there last alblum. Meanwhile I learned how to the play every Beatle Song ever written, joined a Rock Band and in 1971 I visited Abbey Road.
0743424425|5.0|I love this book. And I can`t normally get into a book without getting bored, but this book just sucks you in. <br />Highly recommended!
B00004OCRN|5.0|I bought the tape of this set and wore it out. I was jazzed when the CD was released and have listened to it scores of times over the years.<br />Bruce pulls some magic out of his throat and guitar on this collection. It seems alot of folks never heard of this, but if you like The Boss and want to hear some incredible stuff, check it out. The price is right and you will not be disappointed. Chimes of Freedom is a classic<br />Enjoy and pass it along.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not very familiar with David Lynch, but after watching this movie I want to go out and watch everything he's ever done.  I have heard about Twin Peaks and the following it had, and interestingly enough this was supposed to be a tv mini-series as well but the pilot wasn't picked up and it became a movie.  The movie itself defies description, absurd surreal nightmares fuel much of the film.  The movie is in the detail.  Every shot is immaculately set up, Lynch intending on the placement of everything in each scene.  Although the cinematic metaphors and symbols he use take the movie to a new level, the acting itself is great.  Naomi Watts plays a naive actress that has dreams of Hollywood stardom, and meets a girl with amnesia who mysteriously wanders into Naomi's aunt's house in Hollywood.  The two search for her misplaced identity in a version of Hollywood slighter darker than usual.  Meanwhile Lynch throws in sub-plots involving a conspiracy to cast a film as well as a character that can only be described as \\"Leatherman\\"  I guess at some point it will all make sense but then again maybe not.  Your brain has to work for it, or just go on the internet and read about it.  Either way the movie is a tense thriller that changes you.
6305922756|5.0|I'm writing this review assuming you've already watched the movie itself, and are just shopping because of the &quot;Special Edition&quot;.  Well, it's worth it.  If it costs more than the regular edition, fear not.  It's worth every penny.  The movie is already great.  <BR>What really struck me is the extra footage.  They've arranged the extra footage in a fashion so that it very much resembles the original movie.  It's like you get a whole extra movie!  All the funny things are different, as most of them didn't even appear in the original, but it follows the pattern to the letter, and you feel like you're watching the original movie again, but everthing feels BRAND NEW.  how awesome.  I don't know how else they could have made the movie feel so fresh, but to do an expert job of arranging the footage that didn't make it the first time.  Believe me that if the new footage is less funny than the original stuff, it's only VERY VERY slightly less so.  It's hilarious.  <BR>If you like Spinal Tap, you'll be happy.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This is without a doubt the least commercial of all of Pearl Jam's albums. By 1994, they were suing Ticketmaster, the grunge scene was waning basically due to Kurt Cobain's death, and obviously the band was touched by those two events. So the band just went into the studio and created some of the most unsettling music of the alternative movement. <BR><BR>It opens with the dissonant \\"last exit\\" with very macabre lyrics: \\"let the oceans will dissolve away my past/3 days maybe longer.\\" and then goes into the heavy ode to vinyl \\"spin the black circle.\\" Then it goes into \\"Not For You,\\" a touching song and some of the best riffs and lyrics Pearl Jam ever did. The rest of the songs go down the same dreary route, and all of them are excellent.<BR><BR>But this album has its share of weird moments. The track \\"pry to,\\" is a funk-influenced 1-minute jam with Eddie Vedder spelling \\"privacy\\" over and over again. I always loved that song because it made a statement telling the media to go away, and that most celebrities want to be left alone most of the time. Another odd song is \\"Bugs,\\" probably inspired by the book \\"Go Ask Alice,\\" for there are a lot of references to that book, when \\"Alice\\" saw vermin crawling over her, as a result of drug taking. Eddie Vedder plays the accordion on this track, the ending a cacophony of an accordion being slammed down. Very creepy! Then there's the last song... a heavy metal jam basically with a little kid talking about how much he/she likes being abused, and some other assorted, indecipherable statements. Easily the worst song on the album. But since it was something you couldn't predict, it made that song great.<BR><BR>Other highlights include the radio hits \\"Corduroy\\" and \\"Better Man,\\" as well as the heavy \\"Whipping,\\" and \\"Immortality,\\" my favorite track on the album, and a very emotional track to add to that.<BR><BR>You gotta have an open mind to really appreciate this album, and you gotta be prepared to know that this is not \\"Vs Part Two.\\" In fact, Vitalogy is so distinct and so baffling, it's in a class by itself.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This 10 chapter miniseries set is an exquisite mix of Saving Private Ryan with the documentary feel of an A&E type production and the drama, look and the inevitable touch of Spielberg/Hanks brilliance and genius.<br />Incredibly real and gut wrenching, the miniseries begins at 101st Airborne Division training camp at Camp Toccoa, USA. Whereupon we learn about the tough reality of being in the Airborne Division and the severity of living under a military chain of command. Under the command of Lt. Sobel, Easy Company is trained and drilled every single day until they become on of the best companies in the Division, a fact that will prove to be woeful in battle.<br />At long last (2 years in training) the Allies have concocted a plan to start the invasion/liberation of Nazi occupied France and Europe. D-day is gruesome but Easy Company is more terrible events are yet to come.<br />As we follow along the story, we slowly get into knowing people like Lipton, Luz, Perconte, Winters, Buck, Bull, Skip Muck, Popeye, Guarnere and many memorable characters who we see triumph, survive and perish in the cruelty of war.<BR>We are taken into the very jaws of the enemy at battles like Foy, Carentan, Bastogne, the Eagle's nest, all these in the dreariest and bitter conditions of bad weather and lack of supplies.  We are also shown the harsh confrontation and evil they were up against when Easy and other companies face the concentration camp in Landsberg. <br />A miniseries all WWII fans and followers are sure to enjoy, hands down a top 5 stars and Thumbs Up. <br />You will enjoy it.
B00005RZV4|4.0|After months of waiting, and serious disappointment at its delay, I purchased \\"And All That Could Have Been\\" the day it was released at my local HMV.<br />The album opens with \\"Terrible Lie,\\" one of NIN's more straight-forward songs which gradually builds from a straight-forward rock tune to a pounding beats and pointed synthesizer bleats. <br />Next is \\"Sin,\\" a catchy (gasp!) song originally from the album \\"Pretty Hate Machine.\\" <br />Third is \\"March of the Pigs,\\" whose irregular beat and pulsing synth line pave the way for an all-out assault that moves between hyper-kinetic and subdued sections. Unlike the original MOTP from \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" the live version does not end with the fading piano chord, but instead explodes once again into an irregular, ultraenergetic rock. I enjoyed this unexpected turn.<br />Fourth on the album is \\"Piggy,\\" also from \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" This down-tempo track isn't as packed with sound as many of the other tracks, and gives Reznor's voice some time to shine. \\"Piggy\\" eventually moves into wailing guitar, heavy drumming from Dillon, and a piano line. <br />This piano line carries on into the next track, \\"The Frail,\\" the lonely and subdued track from 1999's album \\"The Fragile.\\" The raw simplicity and solitude of this song comes suddenly, almost as a realization of horror to the sonic demolition that has surrounded the listener to this point. As the end of this track nears, a chorus of ghostly sighs rises from the silence. <br />Next up: \\"The Wretched.\\" This is one of the weaker tracks on the live album. It lacks the abrupt and explosive energy of the original from \\"The Fragile;\\" rather, it feels like a clumsy prototype.<br />Track 7 is \\"Gave Up,\\" from the album \\"Broken.\\" If insanity had its soundtrack, it would probably sound something like this. Saturated in rage and dripping with raw power, this track is guaranteed to get even a stodgy listener's foot tapping. Reznor's scream of \\"throw it away\\" closes the track perfectly.<br />Next on the CD is \\"The Great Below,\\" taken from \\"The Fragile.\\" This dark song doesn't much stray from the version on \\"The Fragile,\\" and frankly is a little dry to start off. It is, however, a treat to hear Reznor shout out the words, and switch up the vocal tune a little towards the end. <br />The ninth track is \\"The Mark Has Been Made.\\" To start off with, this track is much like the version from \\"The Fragile.\\" The first significant difference is the strangled, off-key string notes. After a quiet section with a lone guitar on a wah-wah pedal and a section that builds and builds with guitars growing in volume and layering upon one another, the song departs from the album version and breaks into an almost laid-back groove driven by Dillion's drums with Reznor wailing overtop. <br />\\"The Mark Has Been Made\\" shifts quite suddenly to the next track, \\"Wish.\\" Originally from \\"Broken,\\" this track is more straight-forward rock. Boasting thick guitars and an almost atmospheric chorus marked by Dillon's cymbals and Reznor's reaching voice, this is another addictive and somewhat catchy track. <br />Track 11 is \\"Suck\\" from \\"Broken.\\" This is one of the weaker tracks on the album, with very little going for it other than volume and Reznor's \\"Suck, suck suck\\" at the end of the song. <br />Track 12 is what so many consider a signature Nine Inch Nails track, \\"Closer.\\" This track adheres so closely to the original that one could imagine it being nothing more than the version off \\"The Downward Spiral\\" with a crowd added into the background. The last few sickly, dangling piano notes from \\"Closer\\" lead into... <br />...Track 13, \\"Head Like A Hole.\\" This track, like the original from \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" feels much more like a pop tune than most Nine Inch Nails material. It is very well-executed live; its raw, simple beat carries Reznor's voice and the equally simple guitar parts with ease. <br />Track 14, \\"The Day The Whole World Went Away,\\" opens with a calm, organic synthesizer washand a blurry guitar line, then a series of almost animal-like electronic squawks. Like the version from \\"The Fragile,\\" it then moves to a passage showcasing Reznor's voice alongside the quiet bass and synth parts. Rather than burst into the wash of insanely distorted guitars after this (as in the album), two clicks of the drummer's sticks count in a subdued section, heavy on bass, that grows over time and eventually features the \\"Nah, nah, nah\\" of the original. <br />Track 15 is \\"Star****ers, Inc.\\" from \\"The Fragile.\\" The tempo in the live version is brought up somewhat and does not feature the chopping and distortion of Reznor's voice. Overall, the live version isn't as strong as the album version, and its volume is far too consistent throughout, with the exception of the tortured guitar solo during the down-tempo section. Reznor gets the crowd chanting \\"Don't you\\" before giving a single \\"Well, F***... you\\" and allowing the frantic tempo to continue. <br />The final track of this live album is \\"Hurt.\\" The final track of \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" \\"Hurt\\" is one of the darkest and most emotional Nine Inch Nails songs. It might have benefited the song to lower the volume of the guitars, highlighting the vocals even further. During the chants of \\"You could have it all/My empire of dirt,\\" Reznor is accompanied on vocals, and the result is truly memorable. The song closes with a wall of increasingly loud pure guitar over the sound of the cheering crowd that suddenly cuts out, signalling the end of the album.<br />From start to finish, the skill demonstrated by Reznor and his group of musicians is fantastic. NIN's signature layered, complex sound is very well reproduced on stage.<br />Because it covers material both new and old, this album is an ideal introduction to the nature of Nine Inch Nails. However, the production simply cannot match some of NIN's studio work.
1557507473|5.0|Without doubt, the finest first person account of battlefield life that I have ever read. Period.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Whenever Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks get together to produce this miniseries first shown on HBO, only great things are sure to follow.  This series details EZ company's campaign starting with the heroic paratroopers landing in Normandy during the D-Day Invasion and culminating in Germany as the war was winding down.  Featuring fantastic action sequences (the best since Saving Private Ryan) and a wonderful cast, Band of Brothers is a true testament of the heroics of our brave soldiers during the later stages of World War II.
6305922748|5.0|I don't think there has been a better parody of a rock band than this movie. The cucumber scene was priceless, and the mishap during &quot;Stonehenge&quot; was hilarious. This is totally a non-serious film, but it wasn't supposed to be serious at all, and Spinal Tap was actually a better band than most of the hair bands they seemed to be poking fun at. Big Bottom is one of the funiest songs I've ever heard.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It doesn't matter what sort of music you're into (with the possible exception of rap), this is an album you NEED in your life. Her voice and the orchestration are smooth, smooth, smooth.  Is she really just 22 years old?  Norah, you are blessed with wonderful gifts.  How can it be that God gave you THAT voice, AND, you play piano to make the heart melt.  I would pay a lot of money to see this incredible talent in person, and I don't say that often.  Thank you Norah for bringing so much pleasure.
B00005NGZX|5.0|I bought this album on a recommendation.<BR>Tracks 1,2,3.4.,5,7,11 are my favorites.<BR>This album makes you want to Scream &quot;RAAAAAAAAA&quot;<BR>just Ilike Converges vocalist, pure energy, speed, alternating beats, awesome drumming, you name it!!

0393312836|5.0|People told me about this book for a long time, and so I finally borrowed it from one of my droogs (hahahaha, get it? Droog? word they used in the book to describe a friend), and I was pretty blown away by it. I loved how the author created an entirely different terminology for the book...This book, though an entire work of fiction, is proof that people can change their ways and repent from their diabolic behvavior. The movie was pretty whacked out too, though the book was probably better. The video had too many bright colours to reflect upon the darkness of the story, and the rather grey pictures I illustrated in my head while reading this. An undisputed classic, and should be read by anyone who wants to read a good book.
078322799X|5.0|This has to be one of the most underrated horror movies ever made.  It accomplishes what only one other movie I have seen has been able to accomplish--to be very scary and very funny, with neither of these traits lowering the impact of the other (the other movie is \\"Tremors\\", which I also highly recommend).  <br />The plot revolves around Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) who, since the death of his wife in a car accident, has become able to see spirits and even interact with them.  The town he lives in has been having a large number of mysterious deaths, where people have suffered what appears to be a heart attack but they have no heart disease or heart block.  It's as if something had reached inside their chests and squeezed their hearts till they stopped. <br />Not too much plot description can be given without giving too much of the movie away, but Frank finds himself trying to fight the cause of these deaths (which appears to look like the Grim Reaper) and along the way meets a doctor, whose husband is one of the victims, and an FBI agent who gets \\"all the weirdo cases\\" and makes Fox Mulder look normal (you have to see \\"Agent Dahmers\\" to believe him--and Jeffrey Coombs, who plays the role, steals all of his scenes).<br />All of this is tied to a mass murder years before at a local sanitarium, but Frank has to risk his life to find out what is going on before he can begin to try to figure out how to stop it.<br />I've watched this movie so many times that I wore out my VHS version and bought it on DVD.  Even after you've seen the movie and seen the pieces all fall into place, it's still enjoyable to watch.  It still is creepy and funny, even after multiple viewings.  I think it is one of the best horror movies ever made.
B000068IEU|5.0|This is a tough movie to review.It made me very emotional seeing the suffering and torture that those poor teenage girls went through.It seemed so real the way they were being humiliated and the enjoyment that the killers took in it.It's not a movie that I would be interested in seeing multiple times.I thought the acting was very good for such a low budget film.It was gruesume the revenge that the parents took out on the killers.I felt it was very deserved,though,and felt zero sympathy for them.I totally could understand why the parents lost there minds when they found out what happened to their poor daughter.I know some say that what the parents did make them just as bad as the killers but I don't agree.Killing innocent children was way worse to me.I also know that the comedy scenes bugged some but I feel it was necessary to get a break from the violence for a while.I would recommend this movie but it is tough to watch and not the type for people who are upset by watching violence.
B000063DHK|5.0|This is on of the best live albums I have ever listened to. It ranks up there with \\"KISS Alive!\\" and \\"The Who: Live at Leeds\\". If you are a metal fan, this album is a must have. It is truly a metal masterpiece. It smokes from begining to end. Buy it, you'll love it! I guarantee!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was the best series that I have seen in my meer 20 years on earth.  Full of action, and 10 times better than Saving Private Ryan.  Full of honor, duty, respect, courage, patriotism, and comrodery.  I highly recommend this to everyone.
6301697707|5.0|This movie accomplishes what few can do, to be both very funny and very scary.  The cast of the movie is small but exemplary.  Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon have a wonderful chemstry together as two handymen trying to make a living in a town of fourteen people.  This is a movie that you can watch over and over.  It doesn't matter how many times you see it, it's still funny where it's supposed to be funny, and it still manages to put you on the edge of your seat during the suspenseful parts.  The language is pretty salty if you've got kids (it's heavily dubbed when it's shown on television), although the two sequels toned down the language.  Otherwise, the violence is mostly implied; this movie is not a gorefest.<br />This is a movie you should not miss!!
B000069CWE|5.0|Contrary to what other users have said, the remixing on Reanimation is as good as it could've been.  The variety of artist features was incredible, considering the difficulty of getting 27 different artists to help make one cd.  And they mixed all of the songs enough to make each song unique, while still recognizable to its Hybrid Theory (or other) counterpart.  Reanimation is a great CD if you liked Hybrid Theory, or if you like remixed/ techno-style music!  ...
B000068IEU|1.0|let's get strait to the point, this movie [stinks]! There is nothing scary about this movie, not disturbing, not even cool, it reeks with stupidity and Wes trying to cause controversy. The only \\"painful\\" scene is were a guy gets his special friend bit off. That's it! This film diserves to be burnt, and it owes me a star!

B0000041Z5|5.0|Sir Georg Solti was one of the great champions of music of the Romantic era.  This set is an outstanding example of why that reputation survives his death.  London records and the Chicago Symphony under Solti set a standard for clear and precise sound.  It is lavish. Having wallowed in numerous other sets of the Brahms symphonies, I was amazed at how details leaped out in these performances. Brahms' genius is heard to greater advantage here than in any other version of the four symphonies. Solti developed the Chicago into probably the finest orchestra of the last 30 years, at least for the 19th century repertoire. Abetted by this stellar ensemble, his interpretations are intelligent, passionate and  brilliantly executed.  There is more substance than in von Karajan's versions, better sound than in Abbado's original set for DGG - which featured four different European orchestras and has been one of the finest sets, and more insight than even Szell and the Cleveland displayed. As a bonus, Solti plays the Tragic and Academic Festival Overtures with characteristic aplomb.  This is one of the immortal recordings of Brahms' epic symphonies and very reasonably priced.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Long before CGI, the late Jim Henson, along with Frank Oz, spent five years creating a remarkably detailed alien planet, endearing and bizarre creatures, and an adventurous story for the film \\"The Dark Crystal\\" using the power of puppetry.<br />The film begins with a brief narration providing an introduction to the alien world where the lives of its inhabitants are linked to the power of a massive crystal.  Those most influenced by the crystal are the gentle Mystics and the evil Skeksies.  Over the past 1000 years, the Skeksies harnessed the power of the crystal to enslave others, mostly the Gelflings (whom they fear) and the Podlings.  The Skeksies systematically hunted down and destroyed nearly all of the Gelflings because an ancient prophecy foretells that a Gelfling will destroy them.  One Gelfling, Jen, whose family was destroyed by the Skeksies, survives and is found and raised by the Mystics.  The Mystics send him forth on an odyssey to find the crystal shard--a piece of the venerated, powerful crystal.  Jen must find the shard and put it back into the crystal before the world's three suns eclipse one another in a great conjuction.  If the crystal is incomplete at the great conjuction, their world will forever be plunged into darkness; but if the crystal is restored, their world will be reborn.  Jen does not initially fully understand the significance of his quest, but he proceeds and discovers many great and terrible things along the way.  Will Jen succeed?  Let the story of \\"The Dark Crystal\\" unfold before you and find out!<br />Jim Henson's vision of the \\"The Dark Crystal\\" is a masterpiece capturing the imaginations of children and adults alike.
0790736039|5.0|How about we skip the book and just watch the movie. The book is to long and not enough scares, this one has scares through 95% of the movie. After you see the movie, then read the book. Tim Curry is SCARY in this movie. This terrified me as a kid, and it scares me today. It has managed to scare me 6 times! The production values are [flimsy] but that's saying alot because most of the big budget movies lack a little thing called plot (XXX for example.) Rent or buy, I don't care just see it. For those of you who thought Scream was scary, don't see it, this movie would traumatize you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have been waiting for the release of this DVD set ever since I saw the first episode on HBO. This is by far the best WWII series or movie I have ever seen produced. If you have not seen it BUY THE DVDs. If you have BUY THE DVDs. You'll enjoy the experience and sympathize with the characters. Also, read the book by Steven Ambrose. It will make watching the series that much better.
6305754969|4.0|Like the other reviewer said, I can't put my finger exactly on why this is not just my favorite Western but one of my favorite movies.  I think it's because the actors are so obviously having a good time with the characters they portray.  That, and the script is just plain engaging.  The characters bounce wisecracks off each other throughout the movie, which provides a lot of good humor and gives the movie an easy &quot;buddy&quot; feel that you get from movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  The story is simple, but there are twists to the white hats vs. black hats routine that keep the viewer wondering how it will all wind up.  The cinematography is also good...I find myself looking at the colors and lighted areas in the nighttime scenes because it is so warm-looking.  There are some flaws...for example, John Wayne's character is stricken by occasional paralysis when a bullet in his back &quot;presses against something.&quot;  This happens a couple of times in the movie, yet James Caan's character asks,&quot;What is it, Cole?&quot; when it happens for the second time, well after it has all been explained to him.  That aside, and some other things too, I love this movie.  If you want a John Wayne movie that is a good story with no axes to grind, a movie that shows him at his best, and one with an excellent supporting cast, then this is the one.  Even my wife liked it, and she is not a John Wayne fan.  This movie is simply my favorite.  I have watched this movie since I was a kid in the 70s.  I own a VHS copy, and the first movie I'll buy when I upgrade to DVD will be El Dorado.

B00005M989|3.0|The only reason to release a one disc overview of Prince's long and brilliant career is to sell it to those with only a passing interest, and this complitation does a less than perfect job of doing so. The 'Very Best' of Prince was sloppily assembled, including less-important songs over more-important ones. 'Gett Off' and 'Money Don't Matter 2 Night' are great songs, but do not belong among Prince's most essential work. 'Erotic City', '7', 'Controversy', and 'The Most Beautiful Girl In The World'  are essential tracks that are regretably missing. However, most of his best hit singles are here, and for those who won't miss the songs listed above, it could possibly be sufficient. Most people would be much better off with 'The Hits/The B-Sides', even though it costs much more.
B00005NTN5|2.0|I was severely dissapointed with Bound.  Its explicit sexuality is not tasteful, but serves to exploit the women in the movie.  If you're looking for plot, try again.  If you're looking for sexuality, see \\"Better than Chocolate,\\" which has both tasteful sensuality *and* plot content (deals with real-life issues).
B0000696I0|5.0|This is great. I have the first on DVD. I need the second on DVD. I will buy the third on DVD even though i didn't really like it I love the Turtles and will support them always.  When i have kids the first cartoon they will see is my old TMNT tapes. They will also get my thousands of action figures.  Peace out Turtle Fans!
0790743523|5.0|I remember doing a unit on Bogart back in Grade 9. He was certainly one of the great movie stars. While this may be one his least scrupulous roles, it is nevertheless one of his best films.<br />John Huston directs this story from B. Traven's novel about three out-of-work Americans living in Mexico who decide to take up prospecting for gold. Heading off to the mountains, the threesome must contend with harsh weather, interfering visitors, banditos, and ultimately each other.<br />Huston films mostly on location getting excellent local detail. It takes a moment to get used to the fact that the film is in black and white. It probably would have been better in colour as the black and white makes the film look a bit dusty. However, it's unlikely that Huston could have afforded to both shoot on location AND in colour (colour was a lot more expensive in the forties).<br />The one scene that stood in my mind was the scene where Dobbs begins to lose it. With Howard vacationing with the natives in their village, Curtin must contend with an increasingly paranoid Dobbs. Dobbs is convinced that Curtin is planning to kill him and take his and Howard's gold. Thus Dobbs believes he must kill Curtin first. The scene where Curtin must try to stay awake while Dobbs is looking on is truly one of the most frightening moments in the film. Gold certainly has a way of corrupting people's minds as Howard had warned Dobbs and Curtin. Dobbs will ultimately meet his demise in a manner that was foreshadowed earlier.<br />I thought the ending was very good. Not a happy ending in the way that we were expecting, but a happy ending just the same.
B000059HB7|4.0|During the first five minutes of 'Rio Bravo,' not one word is spoken.  None are necessary.  Director Howard Hawks masterfully gives us a story that needs no dialogue as a strung-out deputy named Dude (Dean Martin) walks into a bar, desperately seeking a drink.  Tough-guy Joe Burdett (Claude Akins) toys with Dude and humiliates him.  When the dust settles, Burdett has killed a man and is arrested by the town sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne).  <br />Now behind bars, Burdett makes it clear that his brother and friends will be in town to break him out of jail and settle the score with the sheriff.  Chance weighs his few options as he tries to prepare himself for a showdown with Burdett's gang.  What does Chance have in his corner?  A drunk deputy and a crippled jailer aptly named Stumpy (Walter Brennan).  <br />'Rio Bravo,' as others have mentioned, is not a study of a man in trouble as in 'High Noon,' or a look at hate and revenge as in 'The Searchers.'  No, 'Rio Bravo' is a Western more interested in pure entertainment.  Consider both the elements of and the actors in the film:  In 1959 John Wayne was still a major box-office attraction.  Dean Martin had of course appeared in many films (Who could forget his comedies with Jerry Lewis?), but was essentially a singer who also made movies.  Although Martin has some surprisingly good moments in the film, I suspect he was cast to appeal to the thirties and older female audience.  For the younger female audience, there's Ricky Nelson.  No stranger to acting (Remember the Ozzie and Harriet show?), Nelson appears in the film basically as a marketing ploy:  He gets to sing two songs with Martin.  (He even makes a pitch to the 1959 audiences in the trailer.)  <br />Then there's Walter Brennan, who is one of the all-time wonderful characters in the movies.  I love him, but Stumpy begins to wear very thin as the film progresses.  A very young Angie Dickinson appears in the film, but the longer she is onscreen, the less interesting her character becomes.  <br />You'd think from reading this review that I didn't like the film at all.  I do like it, but I think that for the reasons mentioned above, it strays from becoming a great Western and settles instead for being a good, entertaining film that wants to appeal to a wide audience.  So is this a classic that has stood the test of time?  I'm not sure.  In my mind, it can't approach some of the great westerns of all time like 'The Searchers,' 'Shane,' 'Red River,' 'She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,' '3:10 to Yuma,' 'High Noon,' or even 'Unforgiven.'  But you could certainly do a lot worse.  <br />Running time:  2 hours 20 minutes
038533558X|5.0|On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up a copy of Harlan Coben's, GONE FOR GOOD&quot;. Oh yeah, what a wonderful reading experience.  The story was a twister, couldn't turn the pages fast enough and the ending, WOW!  And the best part is that he writes with a sense of humor.  Well, he is from Jersey, maybe Evanovich rubbed off on him a little!.  Can't wait to read the rest of his books.  A good, fast read. My copy is becoming shaggy from everyone borrowing it.
038533558X|4.0|As 'Gone For Good' begins, Will Klein is at his mother's death-bed.  Just before she dies, she whispers \\"He's alive.\\"  Will knows that she is referring to his brother Ken.  Ken has been missing for eleven years (and presumed dead) after being the prime suspect in a murder case.  It just so happens that the girl murdered was Will's first love.  <br />For most authors, such a premise would be more than enough to begin an engaging mystery thriller, but not Coben.  There's more.  Just after the death of his mother, Will's current girlfriend disappears without a trace.  And \\"The Ghost,\\" a strange character from Will's past arrives on the scene with the worst of intentions.  <br />Coben does a wonderful job of showing the reader the lengths that Will is willing to go to in order to find out the truth about his brother, the truth about his girlfriend, and perhaps the truth about himself.  Coben's characters, both major and minor, are right on target.  While some of these characters may be foreign to us, they are completely believable.  The settings are all handled with just the right amount of information and atmosphere.  All of these elements make an excellent read, but the real strength in Coben's writing is his pacing and anticipation.  The novel never bogs down, never becomes less than incredibly interesting, and always keeps the pages turning.  Coben knows exactly how to handle this roller coaster ride.  <br />I hesitate to give the book five stars.  It probably deserves four and a half.  I thought the ending was a little too unlikely as far as some of the characters are concerned.  I'm not sure the actions of one or two of them would have really worked out the way Coben chose them to.  I may be wrong, but even if I'm right, I think you'll enjoy 'Gone For Good' as a very engaging read.  Hang on and enjoy the ride.
0671027379|3.0|A bit surprised by the other reviews here, this is by no means bad but it is not brilliant either.<br />It is an odd mix of political intrigue, conspiracy theory and a chase story.  At times it reminded me of the better Ice Station by Matt Reilly.<br />It is a reasonable read, but not up in the league of Ludlum or Clancey.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead's second album The Bends sent jaws dropping on both sides of the Atlantic. And for good reason. Fuelled by swaggering guitar hooks and soaring choruses, it recalls the infectious musings of The Beatles but with far more sinister and interesting undertones. Mixing balls to the wall rock (Planet Telex, Bones)with haunting ballads (Fake Plastic Trees, Nice Dream), the material here is completely accessible however Yorke's anguished lyrics and unsettling voice ensured Radiohead could not be snared by clumsy commercial types. Indeed, the sheer quality of the material meant no promotion save listener satisfaction was needed. Disgustingly good, The Bends stakes a serious claim for the best record of the 1990's
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched the widescreen version of Band of Brothers on HBO and thought it was an excellent tribute to those brave men who sacrificed so much for us today.  If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan then executive producer Steven Spielberg has given you another WWII epic to thoroughly enjoy.  If you bought Saving Private Ryan and haven't seen Band of Brothers then BUY IT.  It is an excellent DVD to add to your collection.
6303212379|4.0|This is a very funny movie.  However, the language is inappropriate for younger kids.  We don't watch it anymore because there is a two year old in the house and he repeats everything.  In a few years, when he is older, it will be like having a new movie again.
B0000683DH|5.0|Being the first \\"Star Trek\\" movie I ever saw (and my first exposure to the whole \\"Trek\\" saga period), I can say that while the films that followed it often got to the plateau \\"Wrath of Khan\\" did (\\"First Contact\\", \\"The Undiscovered Country\\", for examples), the film series has not yet produced an adventure that has crossed it yet.  As the crew of the Enterprise face an uncertain future together and career-wise, they find out about an even bigger problem than all of that.  An old enemy, a former tyrannt named Khan, has managed to launch an attack against the Enterprise during a rather routine training voyage with a crew of cadets.  What follows is a tense cat-and-mouse game between two adversaries that will ultimately end in sacrifice and death.  Setting the seeds for future installments of the series, \\"Khan\\" still works as a solid piece of sci-fi entertainment.  This special edition boasts commentary from the director, a text commentary pointing out flaws and even trivia about the film.  The \\"making of\\" specials explain a lot about the making of the film (including the then shocking finale), the visual effects, and the costume designs that influenced the \\"Trek\\" films that followed.  All in all, a solid purchase for the \\"Trek\\" fan.  Highly Recommended.
B00005QIPH|1.0|The strokes are NOT raw or edgy -- They are Pop rock, nor are they part of any &quot;revolution&quot;.  They have songs you can listen too but PLEASE PLEASE don't say they are the saviours of Rock Nad  roll or compare them to any other band.  This album is what it is -- nothing spectacular at all. <br />gimme a break.

To you I'd just say that this DVD successfully shows the climate of being in an Iron Maiden show.     To the Iron Maiden team I'd like to say THANKS for this chance to remember that night, just like Bruce said, that was a very special night.

B000002A46|5.0|I noticed the harsh reviews on this album and was shocked, but then I realized they were very close together and a Celine Dion or Whitney Houston fan probably wrote them to down Mariah. First of all, Mariah has far from a paper-thin voice. This album truly lets her voice shine through. Hairs on my arm stand up when i hear songs such as 'O Holy Night', 'Jesus, What A Wonderful Child', etc... because her voice is so amazing that it surpasses most female vocalists. The beats are definately not 'rap inspired'. This album is a mixture of gospel,pop,tradiational,christian,and r&amp;b music. Rap beats and rappers are no where to be found in this collection. Don't let the haters fool you guys. Mariah is an amazing vocalist and this album is the best Christmas one I have yet to hear. I agree Celine Dion's is great, but Mariah's voice has soul which Celine seems to lack, and it really gives you a warm feeling inside. Christmas wouldn't be the same without this cd!
B000002MP2|5.0|I can't stand it when people call this punk. Anyone that calls Green Day a punk band obviously has very little idea what punk actually means. It does have some ramones influence but thats just in the guitar style. But being the open-minded punker that I am I have to admit I listen to this album almost everyday, and thats out of a collection of about 400 underground punk/hardcore albums, so I have to say I do love this album and I love green day. They're a great ROCK band. Its good to see a band not take itself too seriously. Billie Joe has a great voice, Mike Dirnt is alot better than poeple give him credit for, and Tre Cool plays too many fills in my opinion but I still enjoy it. If you like this album and wanna hear some REAL punk with melodies like this, check out ANTI-FLAG.
0553583182|5.0|This author seems to anticipate whatever excuse, exception, or what have you, as he explains the power of your subconscious mind.<br />I needed a book that was different from the hundreds that I have read over the years.  And I felt as though I was not growing as much as I had grown, in previous years, after college, when I discovered how wonderful it is to read books, for growth.<br />Throughout this book, as the author presents concrete examples of how to solve problems that others present to him, he guides  readers to affirm slowly, quietly and feelingly, as you visualize the end result, and the state of freedom that you will have, because you have faith in your mind.<br />He also advises you to create these affirmations, which you will verbalize at least 3 times a day.<br />Well, for me, I had to say, &quot;But wait a minute!  How can I affirm all of these, 3 times a day?  I have so many things that I want to solve, so many goals that I want to surpass, and some defeating statements to replace with empowering statements.&quot;<br />The answer came to me in less than 2 days, as I chose to type my affirmations.  Initially, my plan was to retype them everyday.  But, through the power of what I have learned from this book, the 7 pages of typed affirmations all led me within one week to relax and realize my dreams.<br />Things happened before I realized that they really did happen.<br />My affirmations were so strong, so much a part of myself, that consciously, I instructed my subconscious mind to take care of things, just as a leader delegates - and things certainly happened.<br />Read this book, because you deserve to master the laws of your mind.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD blows Britney clear out of the water. I've read some of these reviews saying that Avril is another pop Britney singer, but no! She's amazing, she can really sing, and she isn't afraid to be herself in public! I'm sick of all these people comparing her to Alanis (Alanis is an awesome singer, by the way) and Brit and Michelle, because Avril is none of those. She's Avril. Avril Lavigne. Now, here's my review on her songs:<br />1~Losing Grip: Song that is really hardcore and strong. It's actually something you catch yourself singing to. I liked this song...a lot. My Rating: *****<br />2~Complicated: I'm sure you've all heard this. It's usually the first song you'll flip to when you get the CD. This song is a really cool song, and if you turn up the bass it rocks even more. I recommend turning this one up loud! My rating: **** (It's an awesome song, but it's the only song that some people know Avril by. I mean, the other day, FIVE people in this one chatroom didn't know who Avril was until I mentioned Complicated!)<br />3~Sk8er Boi: This song is soooo fun to jump up and down to! It makes you want to grab a random guitar and start jamming, even if you don't know how to play the guitar! The guitar solos are fun and make you wanna scream, and the Lyrics are fun to sing along with! This song is great when you are depressed. Turn it up and jump around! My rating: *****<br />4~I'm with you: This song has a cool chorus and it's a good one to listen to when you are tired but can't sleep. I don't know why, it just makes you relax. Her voice is so awesome in this song. Her lyrics also rock. My Rating: *****<br />5~Mobile: How many of you want to be rock stars? Well, you think it's perfect, wonderful, fun....that's probably true, but this song tells about some of the downs of her career. My Rating: ****<br />6~Unwanted: Go guitars! And go Avril! This song is soooo cool and it sends a good message. What's fun about Avril is to listen to each song and guess the message. Thissong is a good one to jam to! And one of the reasons I say Avril isn't Britney Spears. My rating: *****<br />7~Tomorrow: Song that you find yourself singing to and not realizing it. This is a cool song, and her voice soothes me in this song. This one song seperates her from Alanis (hey, don't get me wrong! I love Alanis) My rating: ****<br />8~Anything but Ordinary: This song is her biography! She definatly speaks her mind and describes herself. And it's fun to sing with. Her voice is so cool in this song! And the lyrics are perfect. My rating: *****<br />9~Things I'll never say: At first I didn't get this song, but it didn't matter, because the song was sooooo fun to sing to! I know i've said that a billion times, but the melody is soo catchy! Now that I know the lyrics, I like it even more! My rating: *****<br />10~My World: I love this song! It's pretty much my favorite! Wow, this song is one that I can relate to, but I can't. Maybe that sounds confusing, but I think if you listen to it you just might agree. Cool chorus! My Rating: *****<br />11~Nobody's Fool: Avril gone rap. It rocks. It's awesome! I love this song and it's my all time favorite (besides My World). It's also got singing, which makes it the perfect combination. I hope this song comes on the radio soon! My Rating: *****<br />12~Too Much To Ask: This song has a powerful message and describes a boy that think's he's sooo cool. This song is cool and the lyrics fit the title perfectly. My rating: ****<br />13~Naked: I don't like the lyrics much, but the music overall is cool and I could definatly hear this one on the radio. Chorus is also awesome. My rating: **** <br />~*¤Overall, Her CD is awesome and I'd recommend it for anyone that's tired of Britney. BUY BUY BUY!¤*~
B00003CXI1|1.0|Lets be honest here folks, Harry Bloody Potter. An annoying eleven year old wearing oversized glasses claiming to have special powers. If he has special powers, why does he not fix his sight...which is obviously impaired, seen as he wears those ridiculously oversized frames on his nose that make his look like something out of the Addams family, (only that was a decent movie).<BR>But of course my review is not all about pointless jeering. The acting in the film is not good either, and the guy that plays Harry Potter (I'll be damned if I know his name) seems to spend most of the time in a trance like state, wide eyed, and in awe of yet another seemingly amazing sight...although the all too poor special effects make it hard to be in awe of anything here, except of course for the terrible script.<br />If you want some good examples of amazing movie making, try anything by Stanley Kubrick, Taxi Driver, Star Wars Trilogy, and anything by Stanley Kubrick. (Yes I realise I typed it twice. It was an attempt at humour, small and suttle, but definatly present).
0671034065|5.0|It's the first Linda Howard I've read, and I'm hooked. I got so caught up in Jaine and Sam's story that I had it finished in a couple of days (then was sorry it was over). From the start, you're caught up in all characters, from the killer, to the friends, to Jaine and Sam. Since reading Mr. Perfect, I've grabbed up every Linda Howard I can find.
B000069CWE|5.0|I waited for Linkin Park Reanimation for a long long time, and my expectation was so high, I thought i'd be let down, but I was still greatly suprised, not because of how good it was, but becuase of what the content was. All the songs remixes are original and differant and every track has it's own feel. The remixers chosen were obviously very talented and the guest rappers are also on par with amazing. They bring a whole new feel to the songs. This CD is the next step of the \\"Hybrid Theory\\", meshing rock and rap to a new degree. I do not mind about all the hip hop, I like hip hop as well as alternate rock.<BR>And all the reviewers saying papercut and in the end sound exactly the same didn't actually BUY the album, but downloaded a few tracks, which I also did, but bought the album ANYWAY, an pleasently found the tracks on the net were fakes and not really from the album.<BR>The opening feature chello and viola played by pheonix that is the same used in the last song, crawling, which is a nice way to start of.<BR>The points of authority remix is very industrial and is highly enjoyable.<BR>In the end is an awesome hip hop remix, with great production, and awesome rapping from both parties involved. Definately leans towards the hip hop scope of this album. These two will releasing their own album in august 20th, and I will sure keep an ear out for it.<BR>Forgotten is a strange track that has a kind of haunting dark rap feeling to it and the guest rapper from Jurassic 5, although sounding strange, has something to say.<BR>Pushing me away is a good reinterpretation with new singing, new guitars and a guest singer, who sounds slightly odd, the lead singer from taproot, place for my head is an OK remix. It is quite enjoyable, but is no the most enjoyable song on the album by far.<BR>X-ecutioner style is not very enjoyable and in my opinion, this is the weakest rapper on the cd. Just skip this track if you've got the remote already in your hand, otherwise, let it play, it'snot too long.<BR>High Voltage is an excellant rap song, couples with a strong guest rapper, the undergorund talent of pharoah monch, who I have heard much of before. <BR>With you, with new guitars and screaming, is an awesome rock rap workout, with an awesome sounding rapper, aceyalone,who almost sounds like he could be a nu-metal rapper on his own.<BR>Papercut is an awesome remix, and has a very good chorus and a good rapper. One of my favourite songs on the album, with very good production.<BR>Runaway is a cool song, with a new rapper and differant chorus this is worth numerous listens.<BR>By myslef is a simply produced song with no new rapper or anything, just the whole song remixed with new guitars and i s a rock rap workout to the fullest. One of the best and fastest hardest songs on the album.<BR>cure for the itch remix is cool, bring in elements from the song points of authority and even 'step up' from the HYBRID THEORY EP. Definately brought some memories back and was recorded at his parents house (Cool!).<BR>1 step closer is an awesome remix which the chorus is delayed and when it finally hits, it is awesome and was pleasently suprised that Jonathon Davis's contribution is awesome and really adds to the feeling, the last song crawling featuring the same cello and viola in the intro, is mindblowing. The duet with Aaron Lewis is awesome and the song ends perfectly.<BR>Lastly, my december is an awesome slow somber song, although I would have like to hear more of the female singer kelli ali, or something like that. <BR>Overall, an EXCELLENT album i will be in heavy rotation for a long time to come. A mindblowing mix of rap and rock, seamlessly integrated into a single amazing cd.<BR>Worth every penny.
B00005QZWI|5.0|When I saw \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" in theaters, I could not help but be immensely impressed with the music. It just seems to fit the tone and mood of the film. From the music of \\"The Ring goes South\\" to the eerie (yet catchy) tune of the fighting Uruk'hai, this score matches the ambiance of the film perfectly. After all is said and done, the song by Enya, \\"May it Be\\" fits perfectly as well. This is a very worthwhile soundtrack for anyone interested in the movie.
B00004U2HK|3.0|This movie is pretty good for the first half. But I normally don't watch the second. I prefer it when Andrews is the nanny and becomes engaged. Other than that, I could do without the movie.
B000002B7M|5.0|My title says it all, this was a great debut by the king of heavy metal, Ozzy Osbourne. Of course my favorite would definetely have to be Crazy Train, but there is not one bad song on the whole album. Ozzy's vocals are superb(I can understand what he sings perfectly) and Randy Rhoads does a great job on the guitar. I recommend this CD to anyone who just loves great rock and roll music.
B0000683DH|5.0|It was interesting to learn that this was the cheapest Star Trek movie ever made, since it is clearly the best one of all. If you're one of the few who have not yet seen this sci-fi masterpiece, you have no idea what you have missed. Ricardo Montalban as &quot;Kahn Singh&quot; is simply awesome in his masterful performance of the vengeance obsessed nemesis to James Tiberius Kirk, the man who left him and his band of genetically engineered super humans marooned on an obscure, but life supporting, planet (Ceti Alpha 5), which later had it's ecosphere devastated by the explosion of a nearby planet in the same solar system. <br />In the struggle for survival that ensued on this newly hellish world, Kahn lost many of his people, including his beloved wife. We learn about this history after Captain Terrell, commanding officer of the USS Reliant, and his Executive Officer Pavel Chekov beam down to the surface during the course of a planet scouting mission intended to find a suitable test planet for the Genesis Device, a powerful new terraforming tool that has just been developed by Dr. Carol Marcus, a federation research scientist, and her team. Kahn and his people capture Terrell and Chekov, thereby seizing control of the USS Reliant as well. <br />With his newly acquired starship, Kahn hatches a plan to lure the USS Enterprise to space station Regula 1, the research facility used by Dr. Marcus to develop Genesis. What ensues is a truly thrilling contest of wit, cunning, and tactics that centerpieces one of the most exciting features of the Star Trek universe - starship combat. The battles (which perfectly follow the tension-loaded classic style of prolonged capital ship engagements) are simply fantastic in this picture and lead, ultimately, to some very tragic consequences for all involved. The score sets the mood and tone perfectly, and is eerily chilling at points.<br />This is quite simply the best Star Trek film ever made, and it deserves a spot in every sci-fi fan'svideo library.
B000002UE2|4.0|Having been in my long-haired prime at the time when this album was originally released on L.P. &amp; 8-Track, I thought that Grand Funk sounded better live as a four-piece band than they did back in '70, as a three-piece band on the first live album. As musicians they had all polished-up their acts a bit, but hadn't lost any of the energy that they created when recorded live.  When I listened to Caught In The Act for the first time, it sounded as good, if not better than the Grand Funk concert I had attended in '74. Although I felt that some of the songs they had chosen to record over the years were a bit too Top-40 for my tastes, it hasn't stopped me from again purchasing the album in a fourth form, CD. Any fan of Grand Funk should have this album in their collection as it represents just about the best work they ever did, live or in the studio.  So I guess its true, if its too loud, you're too old.
0792833236|5.0|On the short list of the greatest American movies ever made and also on the short list of the greatest acting jobs w/ De Niro's incredible performance of the troubled La Motta. The cinematography and choreography of the boxing sequences are stunning.  Along w/ Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, the finest Scorcese films.  The filming of this movie in black and white was a master stroke.  The scene where La Motta asks his brother to keep punching him in the face is chilling....
0060977493|5.0|It took me 2 weeks to get thru the first 20 pages of this book.  But don't let that scare you - I just wasn't used to such vivid and powerful language in books.  Once my brain was able to conceptualize the visions Roy was describing, I became hooked on description, and now many other writers just don't satisfy my need for color and light in writing.  Roy's style, because I'm not necessarily so well-read, is fantastically unique and something I recommend to every person who asks for next book project.  Read this book!

B00003CXRM|5.0|I was a fan of other Coen Brothers movies (Raising Arizona, Fargo), but didn't have much desire to see this based on the previews.  Then, just about everyone I know told me to see it and I rented it based on their word....well am I ever grateful!!  This movie grows on you everytime you watch it, I find myself quoting it everyday.  The characters are crafted perfectly.  Please do yourself a favor and watch this great film!!
B000002IZM|5.0|While this isn't the type of music one would play while driving to work or cleaning the house, it's great for listening to while trying to be evoke mood for creative / writing, or using on your CD alarm to wake up to in the morning.  The dreamy music is a nice segue from sleep to reality.<br /><br />Vangelis' abilities are well showcased with this album, though the last track is a little too 80s synth-pop and dated, everything else is awesome.  I'm surprised he composed the '30s pop tune &quot;One More Kiss Dear.&quot;  Actually, I wish they'd kept that off the CD, as it is completely out of context with the rest of the music.<br /><br />Definitely a great effort from Vangelis.  Does anyone know who performs the vocals on &quot;Rachel's Song?&quot;  Or was it synth?  That's one of the best character themes I've ever heard.  Even better than the optimistic &quot;Abraham's Theme&quot; from Chariots of Fire.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00006CXSS|5.0|I haven't seen the DVD yet as it is not available.  I imagine the DVD package will include some nice goodies like most DVD packages do.<br />Even if it doesn't, I cannot recommend this series any more fervently!  If you do not have HBO then you missed it last year.  Aired as a 12 part series, Band of Brothers documents the journey of a company of paratroopers in the days and months following the Allied beach-head at Normandy.<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg, and with an excellent cast of mostly unknowns (the occasional recognizable actor notwithstanding), Band of Brothers captures for 12 episodes what Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List did for a few hours each.  <br />If you love WWII history, buy this DVD.  If you love good acting and writing, buy this DVD.  Heck just buy it!  You will not be disappointed and I think more than one person will sit through all 12 episodes in a weekend, pining for more at the end.
B000060K4O|5.0|This charmer is something I'm proud to have watched in the theater with my family when I was 10.  It's only gained appeal since 1984.  This is a rare, perfect movie - an incredibly hilarious ride.  The story is top-notch, the comedic vision is great and perfectly mixed with an engaging storyline.  This movie will probably never be dated, and is so original it's never spawned cliches.<br /><br />PS - Ghostbusters, the cartoon series, had some surprisingly adult, entertaining storylines as well, just in case you need some more 'busting and didn't like Ghostbuster 2 that much.  2 wasn't nearly as good a movie, but not outright bad, either.  It's hard to top perfection.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
0671027344|5.0|this book was great... i recommend it to anyone who has ever felt alone or confused.  charlie is just so easy to relate to and easy to fall in love with... you feel like he's your best friend by then end of the book.  it was a short read --took me less than 48 hours-- and left me feeling very inspired.  i recommend it, for sure.  :D  enjoy.
B00004TRD8|5.0|When this movie came out into theators i was very young so i can't even remember if i went to see it in the movies but i now have the ultimate edition on dvd and it's incredible!  This movie sets a landmark in filmmaking, especially for hollywood and james cameron.  The fact that this was actually written by a director was great because not a bunch of great scripts and stories come out of hollywood these days.  This one is much better than the first one, although the first one is amazing also, but there is no way in beating out the second one.  There's actual character development and emotion in this movie tied in with action and suspense.  I can't wait for the third one to come out!
B000001FG5|5.0|ok , iwasnt born then but i bet all true bgs fans are heartily sick of s.n.f getting all the attention! THIS is the true succcessor to children of the world! i LOVE the title track and the ambient until!
B000002UJQ|4.0|I picked this album up used for 8 dollars, and it's been the best deal ive got since i got Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" for $6.50.  My friends introduced me to Radiohead first, and after hearing a few songs from \\"The Bends,\\" i decided to pick up this album, OK Computer.  After hearing the opening chords of \\"Airbag,\\" bright and sharp, I knew that this album would be something special and exciting.  The best track on the CD in my opinion, \\"Paranoid Android,\\" sounds mellow and beautiful and wonderfully exciting all at the same time.  The acoustic is simply mah-vellous.   \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" keeps the excitement alive as the guitar tells the story by itself, forget the vocals as if they were in a different language and the song can be appreciated to the fullest in my opinion.  \\"Exit Music\\" hits the listener as a quiet and beautiful song at the begining, with the background choir really tying everything together, and frequent tempo changes accent the soft mood... until the synthetic bass and starshine noises bring out the climax, as it again goes soft and fades into the next songs.  Unfortunately for me, the rest of the songs did not please me anywhere near as much as the first four.  Apart from track 7, \\"fitter happier,\\" they lacked the same musical creativity that the first four tracks had, and by track 9 or so, the static vocals of Thom Yorke begin to get old.  There are a few ways that I would have made this album better, and one would be Thom... you sing with a lot of passion, but sometimes you really need to distinguish when it is appropriate.  Also, the singing seems to be in the same range of not much more than an octave... not very interesting.  Thom should take a breather from time to time as well, and let the guitar tell the story as it did in \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" although it should be featured instead of behind the vocals.  It almost seemed the last 5 or so songs were there to please much of the pop-alternative crowd, and although their rythem sounds pleasing, the creativity is little to none.  In conclusion, if you are a fan of \\"The Bends,\\" you will love this album for it's music.  If you're already into the experimental area and you tend to shy away from popish alternative rock, buy Kid A instead, and only buy this if it's on sale for 8 bucks or less.
6304233639|1.0|People pretend they understand ths movie, But there lying because there is NOTHING comprehensable about the so-called &quot;plot&quot;. And don't tell me any psuedo-intellectual gobbledygook about how its &quot;post modern' or &quot;deconstructuralist&quot;.  Your just pretending to understand it, but you don't.....Because there is nothig to understand.  I watched it 12 times and never even began to make sense of what was going on&gt;  But people like to say it was a great movie to make themselves look smart. This is a case of &quot;The Emporor&quot;s New Clothes&quot; . But The Emporor is naked. Take my advise and spend your money on something good; (&quot;Gladiator&quot; is much better).
B00005T30L|2.0|To hear most people talk about Ghostworld one would assume that the film is some kind of cult classic.<br />Not so.<br />For a start the pacing of the film is way too slow (it takes forever for anything to actually happen), the characters are given very little depth or believability, and at times border on caricature. Steve Buscemi (Seymour) as always is good value, Thora Birch (Enid) reprises her alienated/cynical teen shtick from American beauty and Scarlett Johansson (Rebecca) begins strongly but fades inexorably to become by the end an almost tangential character. The few genuinely funny moments that are here are bogged down in a slow moving, muddled and anemic plot.<br />The biggest frustration about this entire film is that one senses that there was a funny, well observed movie in here somewhere. Scenes like those in the general store, Seymours date at the &quot;jazz club&quot; and his being stood up at the diner are all well done, but they only serve to juxtapose those scenes which work less well.<br />And hey if your going to be basing a movie on a one dimensional character you could choose someone else, maybe the shirtless guy in the store. <br />He did have about 50% of the good lines after all.
0446677450|2.0|I found this book to be a very easy read.  The narrative was interesting, but the book lacked any sort of substance.  There is not enough information in this series of books to take any action.  Add some specifics and this book would be OK.
B000009ED0|5.0|If I could only find it now, I think one of my kids have sticky fingers.
B000067JBN|2.0|But its not a complete bomb either.  The special effects are brilliant, the character development razor thin.  Although I like Guy Pearce, he came off as wooden here.  The script was weak.  The effects and constant changing of locales kept the film watchable up until he settled in the far future.  Then things get real boring.  There was a glimmer of hope when we see the ultimate bad guy (played by Jeremy Irons) showdown with Pearce.  Irons is magnificent, and everything he says is interesting, but his screen time ends far before I wanted it too.  And the \\"epic showdown\\" between the 2 characters is reduced to that of a bad, corny action film.  I had hoped for this film to be great, but it really falls short of \\"good\\" which is disapointing.

B000069HKH|1.0|Does anyone really think Bruce can sing?  Man, he has one of the worst voices of anyone in the history of music!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've been waiting for the release of this DVD set ever since I saw the first episode on HBO. This is by far the best WWII series or movie ever produced. If you love Saving Pvt. Ryan, you'll go crazy over this. BUY IT. It's an even better viewing experience if you read Steven Ambrose's book first..
B00005YW4H|5.0|The first tiime I heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; I was blown away by that incredible, awesome voice. I didn't even know who sang that song, but I knew I needed to track down this CD. Well, Norah Jones is an incredible talent. She has one of the greatest musical voices I have ever heard. She is that good. Her singing will send chills down your spine. I bought the CD just to have that one song. But, as others have said, there are many other really good songs, such as One Flight Down.<br />Buy this CD - you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKGI|5.0|..there is no concidence about the grille of the Mini appearing to have a mischievous grin (go, take a look - at the original Issigonis masterpiece..)..it's in the car's ability to be driven in the manner of a scalded cat and thrown anywhere and still bring the driver out smiling as broadly as the car seems to..<br />..combine that illusion with the talents of Michael Caine and the attitude prevalent in the 1960s when mischief of any kind was done with an impish grin (OK, so that doesn't include the Richardsons..)..on screen anyway..and you have the kind of movie that makes a rainy saturday seem as bright as the Turin skies.<br />All the reviews below (above?) are spot on - rent it/buy it (DVD at last!!)/steal it (Charlie would)..but see it..<br />..doubt me? See the movie, sell the minivan..get a mini..learn to brake with the left foot at speed (in a car with a stickshift?..no idea what I'm talking about?..watch them drift across the Piazza) then tell me I'm wrong. <br />Enjoy.
0517548232|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read of all kinds.  It simply and clearly explains how and why government interference damages the economy.  Even though it's over 50 years old, the underlying economic principle is timeless.  Hazlitt was a journalist and knew how to write.  His influence on my economic and political thought will last for the rest of my life.  I also recommend that you read Bastiat's \\"The Law\\", a 150 year-old classic.
B000002BFL|1.0|I don't mind when artists challenge their fans with something unexpected.  In fact, in 1982 Bruce Springsteen threw his fans a curve for the first time with NEBRASKA.  Rather than object to a demo tape as an album, I listened to and appreciated NEBRASKA.  Today I still consider NEBRASKA worthy of inclusion in Bruce Springsteen's golden period, 1975 through 1987.  In those twelve years, every Springsteen album was a gem: BORN TO RUN; DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN; THE RIVER; NEBRASKA; BORN IN THE USA; and TUNNEL OF LOVE.<br /><br />I wish I could say the same about THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD, but it turned out to be the weakest in a series of Bruce Springsteen releases where he showed only glimpses of his old self.  THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD's songs just aren't memorable, except for \\"My Best Was Never Good Enough\\" and the title track.  After realizing I had not even thought about playing THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD in several years, I sold my copy of it.  I still have HUMAN TOUCH and LUCKY TOWN, the other releases comprising Springsteen's post-1987 career, as each has at least several good tunes.
B00000ILE7|5.0|I saw the Alien movies in order, and I'd say this is the best. I know it doesn't have Bill Paxton swearing and killing everything, but it gives more of a suspenseful feeling. Like the Resident Evil games, it's a story of survival seeing as how there aren't any weapons, but this movie uses that to its advantage. Although Aliens was good, they went around killing 'em like it was no big deal. In Alien 3, ONE alien manages to cause a world of hurt. The music adds to the feeling and the Sigourney Weaver/Charles S. Dutton speech towards the end really got to me. <br />To quote Al Pacino from Carlito's Way...\\"You ready? Here comes the pain!\\"
B00003CXXJ|5.0|a great film as well.  I have seen this film so many times and have a blast each time.  The timing is perfect, the characters are very well played and the stuff is just funny!  Good for kids (lots of fun bathroom humor here) but not only:  adults should have no shame to see Shrek.  A phenomenon.
B00000JIL1|4.0|The Irish God! The master of blues-rock! (altough he can play anything from jazz to country to folk)!<br />This 1972 album is his second release. What a gem, like all his other works! The band here is Rory on guitar, vocals and harmonica, Gerry McAvoy on bass and Wilgnar Campbell on drums. All of them shine throught the whole of the album, so good it is! I just do not rate this five-stars because CALLING CARD is Rory´s ultimate masterpiece.<br />Rory, wherever you are, God bless your soul.
B000069CWE|4.0|Linkin Park's new CD &quot;Reanimation&quot; is much different than their first Cd &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. I love &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;! None of the songs ever get old no matter how many times I listen to it. A great rock/rap album. &quot;Reanimation&quot; focuses mostly on the rap side of Linkin Park. They traded in their guitars for turn tables. That makes this album less appealing to me, a rock fan. I give this album 4 stars for two reasons: The guest apperances by people like Korn's Jonathan Davis and Staind's Aaron Lewis and the creativity. They added some great new lyrics and sounds. I don't recommend this album to anyone who dislikes rap, hip hop, or techno. For a strict rock fan, this CD will disappoint you and probably make you lose some respect for Linkin Park as a rock group (If the airplay they get on popular radio and the Nsync fans loving them hasn't already done that for you.)
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini series had it all. I think this series does a better job of showing viewers what it was really like to be there than any previous production, with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan. Definitely check this out!
0316666343|4.0|By the time I picked this book up two months after its release, I had read numerous rave reviews and held fairly high expectations for Sebold's first novel. The first 70% of this novel is outstanding. It is written with a quiet passion and innocence of a 14-year-old girl that touches the reader very deeply. Each scene is delicatly crafted and serves a very distinct purpose. I admit that I cried at least three times. Sebold painfully develops each character from the dead girl's perspective (I say painful because it's very hard to read about how much this girl loves her family and can't be with them). Sebold is also able to touch very well on how different people handle catastrophic events and grieve for lost loved ones. However, the last 30% of this novel, apparently, is supposed to be dramatically climactic. I found the ending to nearly destroy all that Sebold worked to build. Susie's version of Death Take a Holiday felt very out of place. In addition, the end of the book found all the characters happy and everything wrapped up a little too conviniently. Yet, all in all, the book is extremely well written and fairly realistic. I liked it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Although I have not seen this DVD set yet, I have seen the special on HBO and it was incredible!  One of the best mini series / movies I have ever seen, let alone war TV shows.  I can only imagine the special features included in this set.  A must have for anyone who wants to know more about the world war 2 experience or just wants to see an incredible war epic.
B00005JKED|5.0|My My My! I have been a huge Denzel fan for years. I was shocked to see him play such a gritty character. I always knew he was an amazing actor but this role confirms that the man is just awesome. Although it was difficult for me not to see him in his usually clean cut role I was intrigued throughout the entire movie. I didn't leave saying 'Why did he take that role.' I left the movie in awe of such an amzing talent.
0767849493|1.0|Kevin Smith was one of my favorite directers before I saw this. This is nothing like any of his other movies. There's barely ANY funny parts, it has a lot of violance and blood, and it is so offensive to Catholics. It is also boring and confusing. I don't know how anyone could like this movie, and I don't know why it was even made. If you want to see a good Kevin Smith movie, get Mall Rats or Clerks, don't even see this... you'll regret it.
6304082428|5.0|I watched PRIDE AND PREJUDICE under pressure from an email keyboard-pal, who had previously, at my urging, viewed my own favorite film of all time (THE LION IN WINTER) and now demanded reciprocity. It was my male pride versus her prejudice. But guilt is a powerful corrosive, so I caved, and was pleasantly surprised. I understand that this 1996 A&E TV miniseries version is extremely faithful to the original Jane Austen novel, so at least I won't have to read the latter! P&P's length (> 5 hours) and the number of characters and subplots involved make it difficult to write a relatively short review of this delightful comedy of the heart. Perhaps the film could be subtitled \\"The Romantic Perils of Young Maidens Stranded In the Stix\\", or \\"Seeking A Prince Charming to Rescue One from Rural Boredom\\". Either one is sufficiently descriptive of the storyline, though feminists may bristle. But, let's face it. Even though neither the year nor the reigning monarch is ever mentioned, as I recall, the time is likely concurrent to Austen's penning of the story, i.e. the first decade of the 19th century, when feminism wasn't big.<br />The Bennets are minor, money-strapped landed gentry living in the rural south of England. The parents (Benjamin Whitrow and Alison Steadman) have five daughters: Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle), Jane (Susannah Harker), Lydia (Julia Sawalha), Kitty (Polly Maberly), and Mary (Lucy Briers). Dad is a kindly and utterly sensible man in early old age who remains slightly bemused that he never managed to father a son. Mom is a hyperexcitable and materialistic woman, who, when not fussing about her own material future after her husband dies, is obsessed with getting the girls married off. To that end, the oldest daughter, Jane, may or may not have a future with Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter), a perky young gentleman who's recently bought a country home nearby. Bingley smiles excessively, but has the advantage of an annual income of 5,000 pounds sterling. The second oldest, Elizabeth, has more than her fair share of suitors, one of whom, Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), inspires in her feelings ranging from perplexity to loathing to love depending on circumstance. Darcy is remarkably deficient in social skills, but is enormously wealthy and master of a Great House up north in Derbyshire. The other daughters - the \\"silliest girls in England\\" according to Mr. Bennet - must make do with the young officers of an army regiment locally encamped. The major thread of P&P is the rocky evolution of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy.<br />All roles are wonderfully played, but Ehle and Firth are brilliant. Although Elizabeth's ability to judge people needs seasoning, she's smart, strong-willed, and impossible to intimidate. No flighty girl is she. Darcy is brutally honest, scrupulously principled, impatient with frivolity and nonsense, and proud. Since much of the age was frivolous and nonsensical, he often doesn't fit in socially. Not to put too fine a point on it, he can be positively boorish. One of P&P's most humorous scenes is the first time Elizabeth and Darcy dance together at a formal ball hosted by Bingley. It gives new meaning to the word \\"discomfiture\\". I found two other characters particularly intriguing, Mr. Collins (David Bamber) and Bingley's unmarried sister (Anna Chancellor). The former, a simpering and oily Anglican cleric and Mr. Bennet's nephew, stands to inherit the Bennet house at its master's death. Moreover, in his relations with his own wealthy patron, the insufferable Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), the pathetic and disgusting Collins raises obsequious bootlicking to an artform. Chancellor's character was that of a spiteful spinster-to-be who could've run circles around any Hollywood gossip columnist in terms of pure cattiness.<br />I suspect the costuming and choreography of P&P are commendably accurate representations of the period, although I'm uniquely unqualified to make that judgement.And then, of course, there's the beautiful English countryside to which I yearn to return after an absence of several years.<br />Though it's definitely a \\"chick flick\\", a man should be able to find merit in P&P so long as his testosterone level isn't spilling over. I enjoyed it immensely. But you'll never get me to admit it in the company of my male pals.. And then, of course, there's the beautiful English countryside to which I yearn to return after an absence of several years.<br />Though it's definitely a \\"chick flick\\", a man should be able to find merit in P&P so long as his testosterone level isn't spilling over.

0790729725|5.0|MARTIN SCORSESE'S GOODFELLAS IN MY OPINION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER. BUT THE DVD WAS GIVIN' ONE OF THE WORST TREATMENTS. I BECOME APPALLED WHEN I'M WRAPPED UP IN A HELLA GREAT MOVIE LIKE \\"GOODFELLAS\\" AND I'M INTERRUPTED BY HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD LIKE SOME 1980's LASER DISC. I AM SURE THAT A SERIOUS UPGRADE IS COMING SOON. NOW ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF... IT WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE IN 1990. GOODFELLAS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES... GREAT PERFORMANCES ARE ALWAYS FOUND IN A SCORSESE'S PICTURE, NO EXCEPTIONS HERE. ROBERT DE NIRO, JOE PESCI & RAY LIOTTA ARE THE LEADS AND THEY ARE ALL IN TOP FORM. THE SUPPORTING PERFORMANCES BY LORRIANE BRACCO & PAUL SORVINO ARE ALSO VERY CREDITABLE. SAYING THE LEAST \\"GOODFELLAS\\" IS THE BEST MOB MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, I SUPPOSE THIS DVD WILL DO FOR NOW. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF STARS BASED ON (HAVING TO FLIP THE DVD). SCORSESE'S FILM IS A LEAGUE ABOVE PERFECTION AND SHOULD NOT HAVE IT'S AVERAGE LOWERED BASED ON PACKAGING OR POOR CHOICES ON HOW THE DVD WAS DESIGNED.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has made a great album with Misunderstood. i totally believe she is just that. this album is edgy and soulful and peaceful a must have. she writes her own lyrics. her lyrics are very powerful. she's got potential. 18 wheeler is a really cool song along with family portrait and dear diary. there are a lot of good songs on this album. if you ever feel that you've been misunderstood yourself or really anything in life this is a good in your face truthful tasteful album.
B000069HKH|5.0|Maybe it's because so few rock records have any real meat to their lyrics? Maybe it's because so many bands seem intent on sticking to a tired formula? Maybe it's because as a new Springsteen listener I haven't bought his previous records? Regardless of the reasons, after one night of listening to The Rising I feel as if I've heard the best rock album of the year and I sadly probably won't be as captivated by another record for a long time as I was last night when I first listened to the album, then listened to it again and again and again. <br />The 9/11 subject matter I believe adds potency to The Rising that few albums really try for. The way I feel is one of the very few good things that can come out of 9/11 is its ability to inspire great songwriters like Springsteen to rise up if you will and write such a fantastic set of songs that can help people in their respective healing processes. If just one Springsteen fan feels more at peace with the events of that day because of just one song off The Rising, then hats off to you Bruce.<br />The Rising should also be applauded for not being syrupy sweet or overly patriotic. It seems like an honest attempt to describe the emotions and situations that resulted from that day. As a result of keeping things so down to earth the songs have a much deeper impact. Lonesome Day for example seems at first like just another depressing rock tune until you really hear the lyrics and appreciate that the character in the story is truly trying the reconcile her/his sadness and truly trying to move on with their life. It turns what could've been a very dull opener into an interesting rocker that captivates by the lyrics contradictions. <br />Then the actual music on The Rising is really varied and interesting. Sure you have some classic sounding Springsteen songs such as Mary's Place (which is not a bad thing), but then you have the Arabic influence on Worlds Apart and the darkness that encapsulates Paradise. The songs have a nice fastthen slow pace to them and the music often times adds to the emotions being expressed, on Further On (Up The Road) for example the song's hard driving guitar sound really makes the impact of the song's dark lyrics much more tangible.<br />Then there are songs on this record that just as individual songs I feel with stand the test of time. Empty Sky has a wonderful piano introduction that is short but really spine tingling and rest of the song's slow acoustic strum builds throughout. Then the at first seemingly simply chorus of Empty Sky gains added weight when the character's feelings of loss and revenge are expressed.  Then there's Into The Fire's wonderfully cathartic chorus, throughout the song Springsteen provides his most clear and gut-wrenching vision of a firefighter going into a burning building then places the chorus just at the right time so that as listener you feel as if you release this tension that's been laying in your stomach since the events of that day. <br />The Rising's ultimate fate will be determined if people really appreciate it for what it is, a great record that has the guts to be timely. Because of what it deals with you won't find a pure pop song on this album, each song is filled with melancholy and darkness and yet The Rising isn't depressing. Springsteen has managed to write a record that looks 9/11 right in the eye and still retains a sense of compassion and excitement for life. It's an amazing fine line to listen to Springsteen dance around and it would be fantastic if more artists today had the guts to try and follow in his footsteps.  After all, when was the last we were given a record that seemed both timely and classic all at once.
1558908382|5.0|A love story involving a contract killer?  YES.  Probably John Cusack's finest work, next of course to High Fidelity.  Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Dan Ackroyd as the rival hitman.  Very funny movie about what happens 10 years after high school.
B000060K4O|5.0|What can I say. Not one word can summarize this movie. Its simply the greatest film ever.......filmed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I read the book Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose.  After reading the book, I felt I knew each of the men in 'Easy Company'.  HBO announced that they were doing a series based on the book, I was a little skeptical.  This series is an excellent companion to the book.  It is hard to believe that Damian Lewis is not American.  Ron Livingston as Lewis Nixon was perfect, as was Donnie Wahlberg as Carwood Lipton.  When I learned that David Schwimmer would be cast as Lt. Herbert Sobel, I knew that the casting would be perfect.  Who really shines in this series is Frank John Hughes as Sgt. Guarnere.  <BR>Telling a story about a 'company of heroes' could be subject to dramatic license, but that is not the case here.  I have learned that each script was passed among surviving members of Easy Company and was approved by them before filming.  As true and real as a movie about the horrors of war can be, the shelling of Bois Jacques in Bastogne is horrifying.  This is a must see series and comes with the highest praise I can muster.  God Bless the Airborne.
B00003CXI0|2.0|I am astounded that somebody can take such great material as Rowlings books and fabulous collection of actors and make just lie there! The special effects were adequate, and I KNOW what the actors were capable of, so who else to blame but the director? This is a film that could have really come alive, been an exciting and spectacular adventure, but instead it is wooden and dull. It is as if the director read crib notes and told everyone &quot;okay, this is the scene where this happens, take your positions, say these lines and for gods sake, don't act, don't so much as modulate your voice or show a facial expression, we will paste it all in later with the animation&quot;. What a pity the rest are all being done at the same time, in the same way. If somebody took a good look at this one they would run to find a decent director/producer who had imagination and style and appreciation for the quality of the finished product.
0679735909|5.0|All print copies of Possession were checked out of the main library; however, the 16-cassette version narrated by Virginia Leishman was on the shelves.  Well, I thought, even though it's not bloody likely that I'm going to listen to 23 hours of tape, I'll check it out.  Then, in my little branch library, I also found the book.  On Friday night, highly skeptical of how long I would be willing to tolerate this slow, every-word process, I started reading -- and listening.  I was enthralled. Amazed. Delighted.  Sunday night I put in the last side of the last tape and turned the last page.  What a strange way to lose a beautiful August weekend.  What extraordinary talent!  On Monday I bought the book.
0743424425|5.0|This book is so good, I have read it three times.  Stephen King, the undisputed master of horror and suspense does not leave any dissapointment with this book.  You will read it, be scared, and read it again.  What is interesting is that so many people have only seen the Jack Nicholson/Stanley Kubrick movie version, which is good, but this book does so much more.<br />The setting, a remote resort.  The characters, a father, a mother, and a young son.  These characters are left to tend to a large hotel during the winter season and make sure things are fine when the hotel opens up the following spring for business.  Remote and isolated, the hotel becomes a prison for the father, and he begins to torment his wife.  All this happens while the young son, Danny, starts seeing and speaking to ghosts.<br />The hotel figuratively and literally starts to close in on the Torrence family.  That is when all hell breaks loose.  For the rest of the story, I would suggest reading this book, with a warning; expect to be scared.
B00005TT77|4.0|I say &quot;hats off&quot; to the creative architects behind this soundtrack. We'll never be able to replicate the Beatles sound exactly, but isn't that the beauty of it? Give this a listen and enjoy the playfulness and beauty (&quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; - Ben Harper, &quot;Across the Universe&quot; - Rufus Wainwright) each artist brings to these immortal artists.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched the complete series on HBO, and it is awesome. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, this is much better. Saving Private Ryan was hollywood, with a cheezy storyline and lots of action. The attention to realism in Band of Brothers is amazing, and can be considered a documentary, though no action is sacrificed. I would recommend this DVD set to anyone who has a DVD player, a must have.
B000001FDP|5.0|So here it is 2002 and after almost 20 years this CD still puzzles and amazes me! I have a strong classical and electronic music background and still to this day I would consider this work to stand alone in it's own genera.  It is definately inspired by opera and symphonic works but still there is so much musical style here which had never been explored by any artist (including Vangelis) that anyone's first listen would be an experience unlike any they had ever had.  The combination of synthesizers and human voice Vangelis creates is a union so smooth and subtle he instantly erases all expected stereotypes of both musical approaches!  Truly in my top 3 all-time favorites of ANY musical style.
0151008116|5.0|I'm not sure that I can say that I agree with the inside flap of this book that says it's a book that will make you believe in God (but maybe that's because I already believe in God), but it is one of the BEST overall stories I have read in a long time, for pure story value. This is the kind of story I would have made up as a child and dwelled on for weeks on end, just like I did this book. Only in this story my heart was broken in the end, learning that ... well, I don't want to give it away.
0393320928|4.0|Not a bad book, but not quite five star.<BR>The first chapter &quot;The Making of a Scientist&quot; is from the<BR>Horizon[BBC]/Nova[PBS] documentary The Pleasure of Finding Things<BR>Out.  I very much enjoyed watching Chris Sykes documentary, and<BR>he went on to write the book No Ordinary Genius (also another<BR>Sykes documentary about Feynman).  I mention all this because<BR>the book, and chapter is unable to convey Feynman's Brooklyn<BR>accent (that really adds).<br />Feynman hated writing, and most of this text was transcribed and<BR>edited, so it has that feel.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series by HBO is almost more of a docementary than a T.V. series for entertainment.  The story-line seems very real and grabs your attention for the length of the series.  Each episode focuses on an integral part of Easy Company's journey through WWII.  At times the series focuses on boot camp, the officers, how the medics function in the heat of battle (or cold), and the relationships between soliders.  This series has a similar style to Saving Private Ryan, which I also enjoyed, but the detail seems more in depth.  This is a must-watch WWII series.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are just what I've been waiting for since the mid 90's. They may not be the best band in the world, technically, but they sure are the coolest band in the world. I could nitpick different little details of the record that I think could improve it, but that would just be wrong for me to do. Is This It is the closest thing to rock perfection I've heard in a LONG time. A big breath of fresh air in the stagnant world of (terrible) music these days. I wanna party with these guys....
B000001GK9|5.0|Klemperer, Horenstein, Haitink, Barbirolli--all four, in their respective recordings of Mahler's Ninth, took us more deeply into Mahler's musical language than Karajan does here. And one's judgment of each of those recordings is untainted by the &quot;mystique&quot; that surrounded Karajan in general and this set in particular. And about this set there are criticisms to be leveled, ranging from the lack of earthiness in the second-movement Laendler to the slight fuzziness in the Karajan Gold remastering. Nonetheless, it really does stand apart from all of these considerations (and some of the others raised in previous reviewers' comments on this site), and with all of the different Mahler Ninths I have heard, this one continues to astonish and enthrall. Even if it is overrated, it's still that good! And I write this as someone whose skepticism about Karajan's music-making has increased over the years.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|This is by far one of the best action movies ever!  The special effects and fight scenes are worth every penny.  If you like violence, this is top of the line!
B0000041Z6|3.0|It isn't fair to claim (as some have) that Georg Solti had nothing to contribute to the music-loving public's understanding of Mahler. As a leading exponent of the Austro-Germanic repertoire, he understood Mahler's place at (or near) the end of a long line stretching back at least to Haydn. And he understood that Mahler's music should hit us at full force for optimal effect. And he knew that technically brilliant playing counts for much in this music. However, it IS valid to say that the pumped-up interpretive stance he took in Mahler, while often thrilling in its energy, left a lot of the music's subtlety behind and played down the contrasts. It's a little like seeing a star player inflate a conventionally athletic physique with steroids, and the whole thing is more about technical prowess and pyrotechnics than it is about the symphonic statements the composer was trying to make.<br />This set has uniformly high standards of playing (if kinda dominated by those famous Chicago brass), although curiously for a leading conductor of opera, most of the four symphonies with voices (the exception being Symphony No. 8) don't fare so well in the vocal department. The box probably works best as an introduction to Mahler's music, especially for listeners accustomed to the dynamics of rock, and as such has the added attraction of being a complete set at a low price. Later on, the budding Mahlerite may find that he or she can get a fuller picture of Mahler's world from individual recordings by other performers.<br />In closing, I'd like to echo the comment made by another Amazon poster who wondered why Decca has never reissued all of Solti's original Mahler recordings (from the '60s and early '70s) in a complete set, as Philips did with the 1960s Haitink series and Sony did with Bernstein's first cycle. None of the digital remakes (Symphonies 1-4 and 9) improve on the originals, and the remakes were probably done strictly out of marketing considerations rather than musical ones.
B000002U9E|5.0|If you have never listened to Kate Bush's music you are in for a treat.  Her albums are amazing and beautiful.<BR>This was the first album I had heard by her all those years ago and fell in love with her voice.<br />Would love to see her tour the U.S.
B000063K2W|5.0|One of the most flawless of oldies, this movie keeps a pace that is breathtaking. It doesn't baby you - you have to listen as fast as they talk. Even though Rosalind Russell (who I normally adore) can be shrill at times, the performances of Shearer and Crawford alone make this movie worth watching, again and again. It is also visually beautiful given the costume and set design You find yourself mentally coloring in the luscious evening gowns! It's smart, funny and fascinating, a little time capsule as well. Only Cukor could have pulled off dealing with these divas!
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is by far one of the best punk bands around!  This CD is incredible just like the rest of their music.  Check out &quot;I'd do anything&quot;, it's definately one of the best songs on the CD.  If you like the CD, see them live! They are so amazing!  Have fun listening!
044022425X|5.0|Since this is the fourth in the Outlander series, let me give you a brief recap first. The books revolve around Claire, a 1940's post war nurse who falls through a circle of stones in Scotland, similar to Stone Henge. She ends up in Scotland in the 1700's, meets up with a Scottish Highlander named Jamie Fraser, and goes on many incredible adventures. What I probably like best about these books is the fact that it is told from Claire's viewpoint, on finding herself in the past and the amazing love affair with Jamie Fraser, who any woman would swoon over. The first book is how they met, the second revolves around the Battle of Culloden, and the third picks up with Claire, after being sent back through the stones in the last book, now twenty years later with her daughter Brianna, discovers that Jamie survived after the Battle of Culloden. It involves her search into what happened to him, and her decision with whether or not to chance going back through the stones after him. This fourth installment I believe is my favorite of all,...so far.  This one covers the period of Jamie and Claire and their &quot;entourage&quot;, adjusting to life in the &quot;wild lands&quot; of the New World.  It also covers their daughter, Brianna, and Roger, who were left behind and their discovery of what will happen to Claire and Jamie in the future.  It involves Brianna trying to save her parents, Roger trying to save Brianna, and the harrowing experiences they encounter through it all.  The book nicely moved between Claire and Jamie's story and Brianna and Roger's.  It once again had me glued to the pages, once again taking it everywhere with me and reading as much as I could every chance I got.  One of the great things about this series is you never get bored...EVERY SINGLE page is exciting and you care about them and cannot wait to see what happens next.  I just finished this today and already started on The Fiery Cross.  According to the author's website, there will be at least two more books after that, but I am hoping there will be many more.  Yes, I have become obsessed and have given the same fate to my friends who I have loaned my books out to.  You have GOT to get these books, but make sure you read them in order!  Again, these books are definitely not boy meets girl, the end.  That's so boring!  I hate traditional romance novels.  This involves time travel, history, romance and adventure, all rolled into one.  These are by FAR the best books I have ever read, and I read alot of them!
B00005JLEX|5.0|This seriously needs to be released on DVD as soon as possible...such a work of art needs to be shared with the world more than twice a day in reruns.  Please do yourself a favor, do your daughter a favor and release this show.  ...
B00004VWA7|5.0|I am a bass player, and when I started to improvise I searched for a good Jazz Bassists CDs to listen and learn from. The first CD I bought was this one, and I was charmed with Jaco's creamy-silky-soft sound. My teacher once said to me &quot;An average player that's using good equipment, would sound like a great player&quot;. Here we have a Bass Genius, a truly amazing bass players with superb control on his instrument and in addition he's using the best equipment possible: a 1960 fretless Fender Jazz Bass and a 1962 fretted one. I belive the amps were great (After all, it's a recording studio!), so the result is that the album is a blast! Indeed a must have for any bassist and for any Jazz Lover.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Out of the hundreds of cds i have bought this one is easily the best.  no other cd has been see addicting (to the point where you could listen to it 3 times straight) but never gets old.  The melodies are outstanding and the guitar riffs are great.  While the enite cd is absolutely fabulous and its hard to pick a single favorite i have to say that hold on, minority and dead beat holiday are the best.  easily green days best cd yet, this one is a must buy for not only green day fans but music fans in general.
B00005JH7D|5.0|In my opinion, there are 3 bass players that are above all the rest, they are equal in stage, but different from each other like day and night: Jaco, with his creamy-silky soft sound, Patitucci, the master of the 5 and 6 strings bass, and Marcus Miller with his rough sound. Miller's sound is unique and has some natural toughness that keeps you on your toes through the album. Yet, it is a very cool sound, and if you play the bass, you'll find yourself copying it when you wanna feel cool (Bass Players- try the Marcus Miller style in Band-In-a-Box, it's so fun to improvise on it...). This album is a must for any bass players, and it's completing the basic trio that every bass player should know. If you listen to Jaco, Patitucci and Miller, you have, in my opinion enough knowledge about the different bass-sounds to start and develop your own personal sound. Very cool, and indeed a must.
B00005JL3A|1.0|In one word, HORRIBLE!  I mean the story line was weak and I can't belive Capcom let them release this garbage!  <BR>The acting, don't get me started.......and the constant long pauses put me to sleep! <BR>To put it simple, DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE......!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|One things for sure, the closing credits have it right \\"The Ultimate Experience In Gruelling Terror\\"<BR>I'm not one to be easily scared by a horror film (or any other film unless Kevin Costner is in it)so if I didnt fully appreciate the terrifying parts of this movie please excuse me.<BR>What I will say is that Evil Dead is the closest anything has come to giving me goosebumps.  Its not the effects, theyre cheap (though extremely well done for the budget) and its not that I have a particular fear of Zombies, but the atmosphere in this film is incredible.<BR>For the most part shot in one location (or rather the story takes place in a single location - a remote cabin) it builds upon everyones natural suspicion of the woods and it uses that to creep you out to great effect.  Using subtle but creepy shots like the blackening of the moon, growls from the woods as it comes alive and an unseen force speeds towards the cabin and the young teens trapped there, the subtlety of the music to build tension, the overall darkness of the movie, and the way it doesnt rush into the next make up effect.  <BR>Thats not to say it isnt gory, gorehounds will have a great time with this movie, but you can also appreciate how the tension is built to almost breaking point, where your on the edge of your seat waiting and genuinly afraid of what your waiting for.  Its unsettling and plays on the mind that way, in a way the Blair Witch tried but failed (for me at least) to emulate.<BR>Because of this unbearable tension, natural fear and the way the movie is shot it serves to bring to the screen one of the scariest, under-rated pieces of film making genius and without a doubt one of the best movies of the horror genre<BR>Ignore the cheesy acting (Bruce Campbell is awesome cheesy or not) and low budget effects and instead let yourself become engrossed in the book of the dead and the evil \\"within the woods\\"<BR>A Cult classic and so it deserves to be.<BR>The DVD transfer on the special edition is good, its as crisp and as clean as a movie shot on this budget can be, the soundtrack is extremely well transfered to digital 5.1 and the audio tracks are excellent - not one but two!!! Bruce Campbells especially is very fresh and funny and worth the price of the DVD alone.  An excellent addition to a collection, and a worthy buy if you find the Book Of The Dead limited edition price a little steep.<BR>Audio: 5 (a 5.1 remix and a 2.0 remix)<BR>Video: 5 (excellent transfer supervised by Sam and in original AR)<BR>Features: 5 (only because of the 2 commentaries, its kind of bare otherwise)<br />Movie 5/5 - DVD \\"Special Edition\\" 5/5
B000068FY0|5.0|So many US fans of Supertramp still believe to this day that 1974's &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot; was the band's very first album. This is totally not true---it's actually their *third* album, following 1970's &quot;Supertramp&quot; &amp; 1971's &quot;Indelibly Stamped,&quot; both of which are only available on import, but they're both superb Tramp albums worth seeking out. Now that we've got THAT cleared up....&quot;Crime Of The Century&quot; was Supertramp's first commercial breakthrough, and it's a winner all the way. Many Tramp classics are on this one: &quot;School,&quot; &quot;Bloody Well Right,&quot; &quot;Dreamer, &quot;Rudy,&quot; and the title track. Singer/songwriter/ keyboardists Roger Hodgson &amp; Rick Davies are in top form, as are their new recruits John Halliwell on sax, bassist Dougie Thomson &amp; drummer Bob Siebenberg. The band's unique music is melodic, rocking, and catchy, and the production is supreme, as especially evidenced on this new remastered version.It wasn't their first album, but &quot;Crime Of The Century&quot; WAS Supertramp's first big splash in the music world. It's a terrific album, and a sign of things to come from this great band. :-)
B000006045|5.0|This CD is a constant in my car.  Each song has so many layers to it, it's appropriate no matter if I'm stuck in traffic (open the windows, turn the bass up) or driving through the city late at night (let the melodies and delicate vocals wash over me).  Right now, Man Next Door is my favorite track, but it changes...This is a great album no one should be without.  Beautiful, ominous, and complex enough not to get old; I highly recommend it.
B0000683DH|4.0|First Off, I don't want to knock it. It is without a doubt,<BR>the finest Trek film ever made. It is worth the price and<BR>a fine addition to anyone's DVD collection. The extras are<BR>very cool, and Audio/Video quality is excellent.<br />I, like other young Star Trek fans at the time, Recorded<BR>Star Trek II off of TV when it was Aired on ABC TV in 1985.<BR>( I was 14, and could not afford the &quot;official&quot; VCR tape! )<BR>This is the same EXACT version, with the exception of the<BR>language and the Ceti eel/Chekov,s Ear scene restored to it.<br />I was kind of disapointed that there was no &quot;extra&quot; footage<BR>added beyond that. I am also disapointed that Star Trek III<BR>will be re-released with no additional footage in October.<BR>My personal opinion is that Paramount is trying to pass off<BR>a &quot;SPECIAL EDITION&quot; without actually MAKING a special edition,<BR>as Lucas did with his STAR WARS trilogy. While this is Star<BR>Trek DVD is well worth owning, I'm afraid it is mistitled.<BR>It should be &quot; STAR TREK II : THE ABC CUT &quot;.
B00000I8UF|5.0|It is truly a great album. It has some standards in it, and so it can be a good album to learn from. But the best reason to buy this album is the 2 &quot;moanin'&quot; tracks. In my opinion, &quot;Moanin'&quot; is one of the coolest standards in the book, and no one makes it cooler than Art Blakey. Very cool album, if you like fast going jazz, made by a master, buy this CD.
B000002MH5|2.0|This is the worst dinosaur CD out there the songs are dull and annoying. Heres a rundown of a few songs: out there goes on too long, drawerings once you hear this you'll turn off the cd, get me should have been faster not the same has a good 6 seconds. The only good songs are hide, I aint sayin and start choppin. Whatever I didnt meantion Its an ok song(s).
6301792734|4.0|The Star Wars Saga was a breakthrough in the science fiction movies. It is an imprtant series that should be learned, or at least mentioned, in cinema academies. However, it's not really a good movie. When the movies came out, the then breathtaking special effects had covered on its weaknesses. Today, when these effects are no longer unique, one can see more clearly the weaknesses of the series. The plot is generally OK though kind of weak and sometimes boring and pathetic, such as The Toy-Beaver like Alliens in \\"Return of the Jedi\\", at least, if you do something like that, after making millions in 2 movies- Get  better costumes! The actors are pretty good, not great, but ok, and the general idea is good. <br />Anyway, why 4 stars? Well, it is a classic, and as a breakthrougher it disorves some honor. It has some ideas that turned into cultural icons and even a religion, lately. The immortal Yoda (Though it could've been made better, I mean, what's with that muppet?) and of course, every-kid's-dream: The lightsavors. It is a nice movie, that is generally fun. It is a must see, as an important peice of cinematic history, but I guess it's just over-appriciated.
B000069CWE|4.0|You'd think that after more than a year since the release of Hybrid Theory, that the guys from Linkin Park could release something more than just a remix album.  That being said, this album has grown on me.  It starts out strong with a great remix of Points of Authority and my personal favorite, In the End.  It then relapses into electronically modified tracks with a few unreleased songs thrown in.  It seamed bizarre to me that they would do remixes of songs that were never released in the US but thats their choice.  This album ends strong with the remix of Crawling which features Aaron Lewis (Lead singer from Staind) who, in my opinion, sings the chorus of the song better than it was sung in the original version.  This album also features the music video for Pts.of.athrty.  This is not a traditional music video in that it features no live action but is instead solely done in computer graphics, which adds to the feeling that this album was manufactured to fill dead time before the release of their next album.  All that being said, this album is a must have for any true Linkin Park fan.  Most songs have been changed enough that you don't truly know what is coming next, and some songs even have totally new verses.  One warning, don't buy this album if you dislike rap, because that is what they have turned most of the songs into.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Whether you get caught up in the complex, yet entirely coherent story, or simply swept away by the gorgeous vistas or painstaking animation, this movie shows off the great potential of animated films.  It transports you to a surreal alternate universe the beauty of which surpasses both live action film and computer animation.  It is a perfectly realized universe of amazing creatures, strange spells, and mysterious characters.
B000067G3C|5.0|I've loved Speed since I first saw it at the movies in the summer of 1994. I bought the VHS as soon as it was released. Much to my disappointment, when it was released on DVD it has little to know special features. So you can imagine my surprise and sheer joy when I saw this five star collection. !!Muy bueno!! It has EVERYTHING you'd want to know about the making and production of this action flick. It has featurettes on the making of the stunts, visual effects, interviews with the entire cast, music videos, still galleries, trailors, etc etc. The movie is shown in it's original anamorphic widescreen version and it's in mint condition! It's an excellent film and it finally got the DVD is so rightly deserved for so long. Two thumbs up! :)
B0000007BI|5.0|This is the greatest music I know. I don't know what else to say about it.
B0000028RR|5.0|A great album from a great band.  Too bad Zach is gone. :(
B0000640VO|5.0|Definitely in my top ten movies, Amelie has the perfect combination of pure hilarity and beautiful romance (not the sappy kind).  Following the beautiful Amelie around her touching spouts of good will and wicked little fun makes you feel supremley happy. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially those who need a quick cheer up.
B000002J0P|4.0|30 plus years on and, stripped of all the hype that surrounded it's release, one thing puts Crosby Stills & Nash's first album totally above the pack... it is, quite simply, harmonically brilliant. David Crosby's recollection that, when they first got together, the injection of Graham Nash's high pitched vocals on top of his & Stephen Stills' West Coast honed harmonies produced something quite \\"electric\\" totally underpins its enduring power. Forget the post-hippie drenched lyrics of most of the songs, file Crosby's solo, \\"Guinnevere\\", under a quite different category (\\"brilliantly reflective personal outing\\"), and consign Nash's solo \\"Lady of the Island\\" to \\"possibly self indulgent\\" and... you're left with eight quite superb explorations into three part harmony. Nothing before or since soars quite like these guys at their peak and, on this record, they were at the very peak of their skills.
0140186409|4.0|At first I was very skeptical about how much I would like The Grapes of Wrath, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found it to be extremely readable and engrossing.  The story is not at all dull, the characters are pleasant, and even the feel of the book is comfortable(the paper is not starchy and hard to handle like so many novels).  I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a beautiful read that not only provokes the mind but also the senses.<br />PS: read it, you won't get the same effect from cliff's notes
B00006AUIG|5.0|I rented Session 9 the other day with low expectations.  I figured it would be &quot;The House on Haunted Hill&quot; or &quot;The Haunting&quot; which are movies I liked, but were not really scary. &quot;Session 9&quot; on the other hand IS quite scary.  I'm not going to bother rehashing the story, but I will say that if you're more into supernatural suspense-thrillers (like &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot;, Stephen King's &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;) than slasher flicks, then you'll LOVE this movie.  The suspenseful and hinting scenes build up to a climax that makes sense, but is also very surpising and unexpected.  It's not a gore-fest definitely, and the actual violence is fairly short.  The insane asylum (which is a real place actually) and the tapes one of the characters discover of a former inmates psychological evaluation supply the main creepiness of the film.  Also, the extra scenes are interesting, and the segments about the real insane asylum this movie is based on are quite interesting.  All-in-all an excellent pick for a scary-movie lover.
B000069HKH|4.0|I really did like this album but when i am listening to it i dont find it anything that will become a classic...like some of his earlier stuff.  Its not that i dont enjoy it, and it is clearly his *voice* (feelings...sound... style) its just that i dont see myself pulling this out and playing it in 10 years like i do with his older music.  Its hard to rate this...  its good...its powerful....but its just not a classic, i think
6305897786|1.0|This is the worst kind of movie.  The movie starts out with an interesting concept, then speeds up a little, then slows down, then speeds up just enough to keep you watching, then slows down, over and over again.  I was quite interested in the movie (though a bit confused), until almost 2 1/2 hours into it the movie ended and NOTHING made sense!  It was the worst ending I've EVER seen!  I've never wasted 2 1/2 hours like I did with this movie!  It was like they just got as tired of the movie as I did and just ended it with a short scene that meant absolutely NOTHING!  Sorry, this is more of a rant than a review, but it's been a long time since I was this disappointed.  I'm glad I only saw it on cable and didn't waste money on rental or movie ticket or I would ask for double my money back!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is really good start to people who want to get into anime.The storyline takes a little bit to figure out,but when you do you'll sorta love it.People say that disney made this movie,which they didnt all disney did was dub the movie.
1559408855|5.0|I some how managed to find this gem at a West Coast Video store in Princeton, Nj when i was there for film camp. I watched this movie a total of 6 times during the 3 weeks i had the movie. ( i never did return it) I must say that i was amazed at how wonderfully this movie was shot (that coming from a filmmakers point of veiw) but besides that i think that passolini's choice to stay as true to the book its based on as possibal was definitly a good one. The total lack of character development through the whole movie gives you no time to feel for the chracters and when its all over your left with no feeling something like the chracters that the libertarians who capture the \\"sex Slaves\\". The end of the movie is so abrubt you never get the chance to understand if it is really over. You are going to need two things specially to make it through this movie. 1 is an open mind and 2 is a twisted perseption other wise id not show this one at a family game night. I recommend that you read the book before jsut for comparison but without it you can still enjoy the movie. So please find this movie and look at it and give it a chance youll either love it or protest its creation.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have been waiting a long time to hear a CD like this!  This CD is one that you can sit down and listen to over and over and over and never get tired of it!  This is one of the few CD's in a long time that is great from beginning to end!  The first song is the one that really pulls you in--&quot;No Such Thing.&quot;  After that, it is all uphill!  His music sings to you and his words talk to you.  It touches you to the soul!  This album is one of the few that I have ever listened to and been moved!  You are really missing out on great music if you don't have this CD!!
0316666343|5.0|Wow!  I loved this book.  As a veteran of many books of promising  potential, this book seemed one of many. However, I couldn't   put this one down!  There   has been some criticism of the ending     - well, what did you expect?  The whole book is based on looking at life from the eye of the faithful.  Highly recommend  -  I am going to send it to  my   mother  - can't do better than that!
B000035Z3K|5.0|In the 1970's I saw a revival copy of &quot;Dracula' in the theater and I was stunned at how clear the screen image was.  We are used to a somewhat &quot;soft&quot; TV and grainy VHS image.  The DVD image in this copy of Dracula is as crystal clear as one could want.<BR>This DVD package offers a great value to a viewer and a prize to the collector.  Included on this disk is the original 1931 film or it may be watched with a new modern score by Philip Glass.  Included is the spanish language co-production and a voice-over commentary of the Lugosi Dracula.  There are also &quot;making-of...&quot; features and production notes.<BR>Everyone knows that the Lugosi version of Dracula begins with interesting camera work and really creepy sets but desends into a filmed stage play.  It is also noticed that Dracula, with the exception of a little &quot;Swan Lake&quot; (act 2, scene 10) there is no music score.  Do not let that deter you.  The silence of Dracula adds to the moodiness and the stage-like presentation adds fuel to the debate over the greatness of the director, Tod Browning.  Enjoy the camera work of the great Karl Freund in the begining of the film then settle in to watch Lugosi create a legendary movie icon.<BR>The long unavailable spanish language version is also a treat.  The spanish actors did not match the style that most old movie fans are used to but the cinematography and the sets are excellent and the director, George Melford, turned out a visually haunting film.  It is fun to move from the Lugosi version to the Melford version to see how the identical scenes were handled.  To a person who cut his teeth on &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; and was told that Tod Browning was a great director the experience offered in this DVD shows that Browning's most famous film effort is visually weaker than Melford's.  However, Browning had Lugosi and Bela made &quot;Dracula&quot; a great classic movie.  <BR>This DVD belongs on the shelf of any classic movie collector.  It was the oldest movie that regularly appeared in theaters and is America's first supernatural movie.  That it is musically silent reminds us that by 1931 movies had only been &quot;talking&quot; for 4 years and virtually no movies of that time had scores.  It is Lugosi's crowning moment and it is the granddaddy of all talking horror movies.  Universal is to be commended for the fine presentation that they do in most of their Classic Horror series.
B00004IA0D|5.0|Blink 182's brand of punk is best represented on Enema Of The State, and every song here is fun, silly (except for \\"Adam's Song\\"), and hard driving, as it also is on their followup live album, the Mark Tom and Travis Show.<br />\\"Dumpweed,\\" the two singles \\"What's My Age Again\\" and \\"All The Small Things\\" are , but the rest of the songs have such equal merit that they could just as well have been singles, plus they are distinguishable from each other.  A goofily immature picture is painted in \\"What's My Age Again\\" on the protagonist turning on the TV just as the girl is ready for some sex.  The immaturity of this guy is well-portrayed here.<br />The alien abduction/CIA conspiracies are explored in \\"Aliens Exist.\\"  Lyrically, there are some key lines that elicit a raised and impressed eyebrow.  \\"Going Out To College\\" is sung from the p.o.v. of a clumsy geek in college: \\"The world's an ugly place/but you're still beautiful to me.\\"  And the preceding line is a moment of awkward sincerity:  \\"And I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine/Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody\\"  And in \\"Dysentery Gary,\\" the frustration at losing a girl to a slimeball results in the lyric:  \\"F--- this place, I lost the war, I hate you all, your Mom's a whore.\\"<br />\\"Adam's Song\\" tackles the topic of suicide with lyrics veering from serious \\"I'm too depressed to go on/You'll be sorry when I'm gone\\" to goofy \\"Remember the time I spilled the cup/of apple juice in the hall.\\"<br />Party life is the theme on \\"The Party Song\\" and \\"Anthem.\\"  Shallow, false image giving, game playing, 'look but you can't touch' girls are trashed in the former to my delight.  Rebellion against inattentive parents are touched on in the latter.  The four bonus live tracks on this import rival the energy of the MT&T show.<br />As for the bonus disc, it has \\"All The Small Things\\" and four live tracks.  Like the other bonus live tracks on disc one, it offers a lot more of what the Mark, Tom, and Travis Show would be chock full of, such as Tom's trademark funny, pottie-mouthed dialogue.  However, these live versions are of lesser calibre than even the bonus tracks on disc one.  One funny point is raised on Tom's inability to remember their set.  Mark tells him \\"That's the kind of s--t that gives you five more minutes of talking.\\"  Oh, so THAT's his secret.<br />Normally, a punk album ends being the same blast of sound and fury that around the fourth or fifth song, the viewer may tune out.  Enema is so charged with such energy that it proves to be the exception to the rule, and that in itself is quite a feat.  Great goin' guys!  Oh, and extra points for cover girl Janine!

B00005YW4H|2.0|Even taken as a pop album, which this is,  Norah Jones is a perfectly pleasant singer, but hardly memorable.    Seeing her live convinces me that there is not a lot beyond what you see and hear -- substance and resonance just aren't there, and certainly no sense of musical adventure -- which makes her far from jazz.    She's pretty and likable in that college-dorm girl kind of way,  but there seems little to indicate musically that there's a long-haul career ahead.    This is more Edie Brickell than Rickie Lee Jones, for example.    She's somehow connected with the zeitgeist of the moment, and there's nothing wrong with that.    But she, and her material, are nothing special.   The most interesting thing about the album is legendary producer Arif Mardin's return to a more stripped-down intimate sound. But the songs themselves -- they're easy to listen to,  and instantly forgettable.
B00005T33W|5.0|From the conspiratory frowns of disdain between Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson) at the graduation scene, to when they both give the finger at the graduation sign outside the school, we see that our two heroines are not the typical ordinary Generation Y-ers. Both don't want to go to college like many of their peers. Rebecca at least has some vague idea, such as moving out of her parents' home and saving enough from work to get a place of her own as a first move. She does get a job at a coffee shop, where she learns about customers. \\"Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.\\" Sounds like me at work.<br />They spend their first weeks of freedom following people whom Enid thinks might be Satanists, going to Wowsville, \\"the Taj Mahal of fake 50's diners\\" complete with a waiter they nickname Weird Al, and make caustic comments about their conformist peers, such as Melorra, a bubbly extraverted dingbat from high school whom they mimic behind her back.\\" With some female cajoling, they get Josh, a guy they like to torment, to drive them places. The note they leave on his apartment door is funny!<br />Their lives begin to diverge when they play a practical joke on Seymour (Steve Buscemi) at Wowsville. They follow him home and later, Enid buys an old blues-country record at his garage sale, of which she's totally enthralled by Skip James' \\"Devil Got My Woman.\\" From then on, she hangs with him, slowly pushing Rebecca to the sidelines.<br />Seymour's a reclusive eccentric, collecting memorabilia from the 1930's and 1940's. Like Enid, he isn't comfortable with mainstream life. \\"I can't relate to 99% of humanity.\\" he tells her, to which she replies, \\"I can't relate to humanity either but it's not completely hopeless.\\" His statement of not being in the same universe rang a chord inside me. Another time, he asks her, \\"You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? [You] can't connect with other people so you fill your life with...I'm just like all these other collector losers.\\" Fits me to a tee.<br />Enid (with her ever-changing glasses) really has a blast at Anthony's, an adult shop, laughing and pointing at the paraphernalia inside, much to the discomfort of the other shoppers.  And check out that sexy leopard mini and black blouse she's wearing.  Rowr!<br />Brilliant dialogue peppers this gem of a movie. Enid uses her usual sarcasm on her job at the theatre, to a popcorn customer who wants extra butter: \\"Smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge.\\" Seymour makes a commentary on racism in America: \\"People still hate each other, they just know how to hide it better.\\"<br />At the high school graduation we first see Enid in her red gown. She's also dressed in red at the end of the movie, coming full circle, meaning, that yes, she has gone through a lot during the few months after high school, but in a sense, she's still where she is, alienated by the rest of society.<br />Contrary to what I've heard or read, Scarlet Johannsson makes an excellent compliment to Thora Birch. She's more reserved and more knowing on what's expected of her now. Thora Birch is a marvel as Enid, unsure what she wants, as she undergoes a transition period that takes her into the unknown. However, Steve Buscemi's Seymour made me think, \\"Is this really the same guy who was Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs and that guy 'who was funny-looking in a general sort of way' in Fargo? WOW!\\"<br />So for those of you who don't relate to the rest of humanity in a major way, whose disillusioned lives are full of enlarged holes and tight cracks, this movie's especially for you.just like all these other collector losers.\\" Fits me to a tee.<br />Enid (with her ever-changing glasses) really has a blast at Anthony's, an adult shop, laughing and pointing at the paraphernalia inside, much to the discomfort of the other shoppers.

0679601686|5.0|I have been hooked on this book since I was 15 and read it for the first time.  I have read it at least once a year since then and just hope for my Darcy to find me as well.<br />The movie first got me interested in reading the book, but I must admit that I much prefer to read the book to watching the movie (although Colin Firth does have a lot to offer).  I am always in suspense to see if Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy will come together and I am always so glad when they do.<br />Read this once and then read it again, and again, and again, and again...
6304539258|5.0|The dramatic musical opening says it all. Star Wars is a fantastic series that deals with the timeless theme of good vs. evil. A New Hope is not as mature as The Empire Strikes Back, but it is undoubtedly second best. The cast was very young, so don't expect top notch acting; but isn't that one of the things that makes star wars so great!? You can tolerate cheesy acting b/c the plot, the theme, the production are all so incredible. My favorite sequence is the beginning, when a rebel cruiser is boarded by imperial troops and you get you're first glimpse at Darth Vader and his classic heavy breathing. Watch this movie over and over again; you will never get tired of it.
0743442539|5.0|I picked up this book after seeing a copy of The Constant Gardener, simply because it is supposed to be Le Carre's greatest work.  Having read my fair share of Clancy, I started reading expecting gunfights, chases, and high level assassinations.  What I discovered was a book that relies on much more subtle tactics for its suspence.  But that is what makes it such a masterpiece.  Le Carre expertly demonstrates how betrayal and deception can entangle a person's emotions and destroy who they are.  He depicts the world in a harsh light, where there is no moral certainty, only a vast array of pieces on a fog covered chess board.
6305278016|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I am a Japanophile, and although Douglas does portray an &quot;ugly American,&quot; he does it well! Sometimes you have to realize that different cultures clash, but if the desired end result is the same, who cares? One way is not always the best, and this movie shows you how American muscle and persistence combined with Japanese harmony and sophistication can achieve the desired result. Aside from that, there is good action, beleiveable characters (exception being Kate Capshaw) and great on location shooting.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Heck, I really enjoyed this flick! I don't see how anyone couldn't! Jean Reno is an awesome actor and he did a great job in this movie as the hitman. Then, there' Gary Oldman from The 5th Element as the bad cop. And, we have the last kid of the family, the family that was murdered by the bad cop and his team, Natalie Portman(Star War's Queen Amidala). She was wonderful, only about 13 years of age there, she can act! Oldman always makes a nice bad guy, and Reno is a convincing Good Guy! Watch this movie, and I'll guarentee you'll like it!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series is not only true to the book but potrays the reality of war & it's cruelty. Although I'm from the other side of the pacific, I'm still filled with pride for what these brave men did during those fateful years. I'm really looking forward to getting hold of the DVD series which comes with plenty of extras & a nice tin box. To the family & friends of Easy company, I salute you!
B00004WG2X|1.0|I don't think I could have imagined a worse Mr. Darcy. David Rintoul just doesn't fit the part - he just has no sex appeal at all. And his delivery is waaay off! He reminded more of Boris Karloff. This version was a big disappointment. There was no sexual tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the comedy between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett was lost as well. Elizabeth Bennett was played well, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Those who want a good representation of the book should try the 1995 version with Colin Firth. Ahh, now there's some major sex appeal!!!
B00005JKED|5.0|This is an excellent portrayal of a real world \\"possibbility.\\" Washington's acting is excellent, and he portrays the imagery very well. The use of symbolism is, however, disconcerting.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Let me begin by mentioning that I'm not a Lips fan per se, but this album has steadily gained my respect with each listen.  Ironically, this is actually the first Lips album I've purchased, though I had to listen to it several times before I could really embrace the album.  Since some of the songs aren't readily accessible, I would suggest that if you aren't willing to put some effort into understanding the album and the individual songs this album may not be your cup of tea.  <br />Though the topics aren't exactly fresh - life, death, love - the Lips have approached the material with a sound that is expansive and layered, but grounded enough that you can find all the typical parts of a rock band - drums, bass, guitar, etc - if that's your thing.  Some songs are more poppy than others - Yoshimi pt. II isn't exactly an easy listen, whereas \\"Realize\\" could garner radio play.  <br />The flow of the album is progressive, but not rushed. The listener has a chance to really absorb the story as the album progresses.  In fact, you can't really decipher the shift from track to track as the songs meld together quite well.  In a sense, this album reminds me of some peak-era Yes, especially the similarities to Chris Squire's vocal abilities.<br />In an era when more and more bands are turning to synths and studio filters to cover up their (lack of) musical ability, the Lips have managed to create a digitally-tinged album that does not compromise their excellent musical ability.  Done right, aurally stimulating albums of this type are masterpieces of art and music, and this album is no exception.
B000002J1C|5.0|This is without a classic cd with such songs as I've seen all good people and Starship trooper, and yours is no disgrace. The other songs are excellent too, especially the the clap..all accoustic instrumental...superior playing on it.
B000069HKH|5.0|Listing to this album for the first time was one of the great experiences a fan can have when an artist comes back strongly to the basics of his crafts..writing songs and touching his audiences.<br />The Bruce Critics want 15 versions of \\"Glory Days\\" rather then the lyrical magic of \\"Rosalita\\" and \\"Born to Run\\". Face it critics... this is an album to be reckoned with. For the first time in a long while, I am hearing selections from this album being played on many different stations, BEFORE the release. Songs such as \\"Nothing Man\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" touch the soul and hit the mark dead on.<br />I, for one, feel a complete artist not only writes catchy songs, but writes HIS OWN lyrics, and sings one on one and touches the cord of the listener. This album does, and that scares the heck out of the pre-programmed, sample this, play these 20 songs only forever radio of today.<br />This is a great album. The E Street band are key to its success, since they know instinctively what this is all about.<br />'City of Ruins' while played originally on the Concert last year, gets some new life here.  This with \\"Marys Place\\" and \\"The Rising\\" continue as examples of a unique album where every cut is strong.<br />This album represents the generation that produced Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Gordon Lightfoot, and yes even Jimmy Buffett. They write songs that mean something to the listener and create unforgetable images. Its artistry cannot be denied, its purpose is obvious.<br />LISTEN to this album. It will mean something to you. Easily without question the best album of the year.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I'm going to have to say that I knew pretty immediately that the little maid in the very beginning of this movie was a victim of class distinction.  She must stand in the rain getting soaking while her mistress slowly lumbers into the car.  Yes. Yes.  And then she must ride, soaked, in the open-air part of the car.  Yes. Yes.  But wait, there's two more hours of this to come, as the director relentlessly hits us over the head with the \\"below stairs\\" message.  Has he never seen Upstairs Downstairs?  Apparently not, nor have the millions of critics who loved this movie I guess.  It's been done before, and done better.  But the worst crime of this murder mystery I think is the lack of a murder mystery.  There is a murder, but no mystery, and no hint of the Christie-esque charm and suspense the reviews and trailers led one to believe would be there.  And the murder takes so long to occur that when it finally does, you find yourself wishing it was you!  If you've heard that the British well-to-do were both dull and snobbish, this movie wants to prove it to you, about a dozen different boring ways.  So much great acting talent wasted on a film that goes nowhere and offers nothing new, it's a shame.
0064400557|5.0|When I was 2 years old, I had a nightmare that spiders were all over my room. As a result, I was terrified of them, and still am scared of them. So imagine my grandmother's surprise when, one day when she picked me up from school, I came to the car with tears streaming down my cheeks, and, when she asked me what was wrong, I said \\"CHARLOTTE DIED!!\\". Feeling sorry for me, she said, \\"Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Was she one of your friends?\\". Imagine her surprise ( and, I suppose, amusement ) when I said,\\"NOOOOO!!She was a SPIIIIIDEEEERRRR!\\" Once she calmed me down, I was able to tell her about the book, and how brave Charlotte saved her friend, Wilbur. That Christmas, I got a copy of the book, and was delighted. This charming story remains one of my  favorites, with it's themes of love, friendship, and the notion that even when they die, those we love are never really gone. All the characters, even Templeton the rat, are memorable. I can't think of a lovlier story for children that illustrates the values of loyalty and friendship. And to this day, Charlotte is still the only spider I ever liked! You'll love her,too.
B000065U1N|2.0|I am a huge fan of war movies and from the previews of the movie I thought this would be good. However, I was not very impressed at all. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; had good production and good depictions of war in general but it was lacking in scripting and acting. <br />The script just was not all that good and the movie failed to have much of a plot. It just seems that this movie focused to much on just one fragment of the plot and never seemed to move on to something different. In general not much really went on in this movie it was just revolving around the same thing over and over. The acting was not all that great either. I was not impressed with Josh Hartnett in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and I definitely was not impressed with him in &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. This movie failed to give me the enjoyment and excitement other great war movies has like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, and &quot;The Patriot.&quot; This could have been a great movie but the plot and script was generally just to boring to accomplish that.
0316666343|5.0|I'm slightly confused that there are people on this site who have actually said that this book was a. not well done and b. trite. It makes me wonder what they are reading. <br />This book deserves the hype. The characters are well drawn, the story intriguing, the writing well-paced and the fact that Sebold was able to take such a horrible and sad subject and  make the novel neither horrible or sad is a tribute to her skills as a writer and storyteller.
B000067CPX|3.0|Blood, Sugar, Sex Magik / Mother's Milk / One Hot Minute, even Californication, those are Great Chili Peppers Albums, but \\"By the way\\" ?<br />I've been a fan of the Chili Peppers from the begining but I gotta tell you objectively, with this one they went too far down the pop radio mega friendly road leaving behind their funky-hit you in the face slap bass trademark sound-behind. One of the tracks (On Mercury) even reminds me of the \\"La Vida Loca\\"  beat.<br />Don't get me wrong, I still think these guys are one of the best things that's happened to rock 'n roll and I respect them as musicians and artists, but please don't rate this album with five stars as if it was one of their best work because it's not.
B0000640VN|4.0|First, let me state that I love historic romance novels (I recommend anything by Jane Feather).  And I really enjoy Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" time-travel/historic romance series. So I hoped for good things here.<br />My opinion: cute movie. Hugh Jackman is adorable. Meg Ryan looks too old for him.  <br />The plot had holes (for instance, if Leopold's uncle sent him to America when he turned 30, how could Leo have been raised in the Albany mansion?).<br />But the most annoying thing in the movie  was the mispronunciation (TWICE!) of the word \\"viscount.\\"  Actually, it is pronounced with a long i; it does NOT rhyme with \\"discount.\\"<br />(Hubby and I had a good laugh over that one, but I don't think it was intended to be comic. I suppose this is what happens when unwordly twenty-somethings run Hollywood.)
B0000636NQ|5.0|When Alvin Lee &amp; Ten Years After were first invited to play in America by legendary rock promoter Bill Graham in 1968, they wanted to release an album to coincide with the tour. Their 2nd studio effort (Stonedhenge) was not yet complete, so it was decided to release a live album. The result was one of the best live recordings of the period, and it arguably remains as one of the best &quot;Live Rock &amp; Blues&quot; albums ever! As indicated in my Visual History book on Ten Years After - when Alvin Lee first heard this album he thought \\"Well that's it, that is probably the best I'll ever play and there are going to be problems recording in the future because that encompasses just about everything the band can do&quot;. Fortunately things turned out much better for Ten Years After but, listening to UNDEAD, it quickly becomes evident that Alvin's initial concerns were not unfounded. This album absolutely &quot;SMOKES&quot; from the onset and the musicianship is remarkable throughout.<br />Ten Years After were quite different from the other \\"2nd British Invasion\\" blues bands of the late 60's because they effortlessly fused jazz and blues, and that characteristic is exemplified in this album. &quot;Woodchoppers Ball\\" and \\"I May Be Wrong, But I Won't Be Wrong Always\\" are absolutely stunning and every bit as impressive today as when they were originally recorded. A few critics later got some sort of perverse pleasure from claiming that Alvin Lee's guitar playing was \\"all haste and no taste\\", but none of that is remotely evident on UNDEAD. His highly accomplished and precise technique on the aforementioned two songs dances above, around, and under any solos recorded by the other so-called \\"guitar gods\\" of the time. The four new tracks, comprised of material originally excluded due to vinyl record time limits, have made the remastered CD even better. &quot;Spoonful\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" were, of course, played by almost all of the British blues bands and Alvin obligingly introduces \\"Spoonful\\" as a \\"Clapton - Howlin' Wolf number\\". But it's a treat to now hear TYA's own version of these tunes with Alvin's inimitable guitar work. <br />In the wonderful booklet that accompanies the CD, drummer Ric Lee describes the added \\"I Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes\\" as being, \\"a bit rough around the edges\\". Although it's not quite the polished version found on future TYA releases, it is very much a \\"diamond in the rough\\" being an early and quite interesting 14 minute version of the song. The closer, \\"I'm Going Home\\", is only half the length of that famous Woodstock version that would emerge more than a year later - yet it is every bit as energetic, and perhaps even more so! <br />I strongly recommended the other TYA re-releases (&quot;Ten Years After&quot;, &quot;Stonedhenge&quot;, &quot;Live At The Fillmore East 1970&quot; &amp; &quot;Cricklewood Green&quot;). They all have bonus tracks and great new descriptive booklets authored by Ric Lee, with the original artwork plus several additional rare photos. But if you have not yet heard any of them, I suggest you start with UNDEAD ...It truly Rocks !! <br />Herb Staehr
0380820846|2.0|I have read all of Quinn's books on the Bridgerton family and have become a fan of hers as a result. This book was a long time coming and perhaps I've expected it to be the best of all the 'Bridgerton series'. Sad to say, I was disappointed with what I've read. I found Colin falling in love with Penelope too sudden and the chemistry between them lacking. It was as if the book's only purpose was to unveil Lady Whistledown and to let Colin find a partner like the rest of his siblings. These two characters seemed more interesting when they were mentioned as supporting characters in other Bridgerton books.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I guess that if you're my age (over 45) and were reasonably savvy and appreciative of pop music of the Sixties and Seventies, you're in one of two camps about the Bee Gees (or one of three if you've never liked them at all!). You're either in the camp that scarfed up their ballads and songs like &quot;To Love Somebody,&quot; &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; or &quot;Gotta Get A Message To You,&quot; or you liked their &quot;disco&quot; period (and unless you were living in a cave in the late Seventies, you know what those songs were!). Somehow, the Brothers Gibb never managed to find that happy medium between these two different extremes, and while they don't exactly achieve it here, they do get closer to a blend than previously. What they also have made is one of their best albums ever.<br />The (for me) grating nasal whine their that their voices used to have has been replaced by some fine lead singing and even better harmonizing. Honestly, I never have been able to tell which Bee Gee sings lead on each song, but they're all really in great form on every tune here. To be blunt, nobody sounds like his you-know-whats are caught in a vise this time! The songs themselves are also top-rate. I thought I was listening to a lost Crowded House track the first time I heard &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; and there's quite a few songs that recall the songwriting of Neil Finn, Tilbrook and Difford and other post-Seventies tunemeisters (who, no doubt, owe a debt to the Sixties Bee Gees as much as anyone, so there you go). &quot;Wedding Day&quot; is as lovely a love song as they've ever done, gushy in all of the right places. And while their forays into R&amp;B are few and not at all of the &quot;Jive Talkin'&quot; ilk this time out, they have a swing which is graceful and funky all at once. <br />I had given up on the Bee Gees after they became disco kings in the mid-Seventies, but I'm glad to get re-acquainted with them, particularly with this gem of an album.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is a great cd. Some people will be dissapointed because it contains more rap then Hybrid Theory. On the other hand, die-hard Linkin Park fans will love it. The new mix of \\"Crawling\\" is beautiful. I was kinda dissapointed in \\"One Step Closer\\" though. It was way too slow. But overall, great listening fun. Buy it now.
B000067CPX|5.0|After becoming a chili pepper fan with Californication for it's profound bass lines and beautiful guitar melodies (by guitar god john frusciante),  I am in love with this new album.  As always the chili peppers deliver melodies that are intriguing.  My only regret is that it doesn't provide hard, fast tempoed songs like 'Around the World' from Californication, nor the dark, luring songs like 'Otherside' or 'Parallel Universe'.  Yet there are beautiful, harmonic songs that were only hinted at with 'Road Trip'.   Overall this is a beautiful cd features great songs like 'Don't Forget Me', 'Warm Tape', and AWSOME  ska rooted 'On Mercury'.  I recommend this for anyone that preferes real music, opposed to Britney Spears pop.
B000002KHH|5.0|30+ years ago \\"Paranoid\\" was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world, the second album for Black Sabbath after their debut album \\"Black Sabbath\\".  The late 60s and early 70s were a great time for experimentation, and rock was heading all over the place as various groups pushed the limits of what rock could be and where it could lead.<br />Paranoid remains a good album after 30+ years, a remarkable feat.  \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man\\" are considered primers for metal music, which we called hard rock in those ancient days, with a very basic bass, lead guitar, and drums sound, and the gritty, earthy voice of the Oz-man.<br />Of course some parents and many religious leaders pounced on the group's name and some of their lyrics.  On the other hand, the current-day version of these same people complain that Harry Potter promotes witchcraft.<br />The lyrics in this album are mild, almost mainstream by today's standards.  Furthermore, the lyrics are not all that breakthrough or novel, but when the lyrics are coupled with the music and Ozzy's voice, you have what was in 1971 a breakthrough album that sold very well, in spite of nearly zero radio play (except on the infamous, but not really, underground FM stations).<br />What else is on this album?  \\"Planet Caravan\\" is a spacey tune that is a holdover from the psychedelic rock of the late 60s.  I enjoy this song with its synthesized voice and mellow mood.  \\"Electric Funeral\\" is another hard rocker in the vein of \\"War Pigs\\" and \\"Iron Man\\".  The transition in this song is solid hard rock, bridging a relatively slow beginning to a brief lead guitar solo that takes off into a screamer...and then back to the slow beat of the intro.  Ozzy is nearly singing a dirge at the beginning and end of the song, but that's also the point of the song.<br />\\"Hand of Doom\\" starts with the bass, adding drums and then Ozzy's voice.  After the intro the lead guitar thrusts into the song and Ozzy start putting himself into the song.  The song switches back and forth between the bass/drums/mellow Oz to heavy bass, lead guitar, drums and Ozzy's full voice.  Then the song suddenly changes so that it's almost like a completely different song, another hard rocker that may be the most metal song on the CD.  Then about two minutes from the end of the song the speed slows down in a reprise of the beginning.  By the way, this song is about drugs, but the images are not positive.<br />Next you've got \\"Rat Salad\\".  This song is an instrumental, excellent drum work (turn up the bass!), setting you up for the last song.<br />I love \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\".  I realize the lyrics are borderline corny, but on the other hand here's Ozzy singing about somebody who's clearly having a trip (chemically induced).  Fortunately for many of us, the song is all the trip we need and the chemistry set is not required.  This song is fun and good and has excellent riffs and bass.<br />Music has changed a lot in 30 years.  But some things remain the same.  This album is one of them.  I hope I enjoy it 30 years from now as much as I enjoy it today.k and forth between the bass/drums/mellow Oz to heavy bass, lead guitar, drums and Ozzy's full voice.

B00003CX7L|5.0|This very funny video has such a good script, that grown-ups can enjoy it as much as the kids.  This time out, Woody gets taken from a garage sale and ends up in a valuable collection.  Should he go home?  Can he go home?  Is Andy growing up and losing interest in him?  The  toy characters are very funny; I especially like Rex, the dinosaur and Wheezy, the penguin.  Of course, Woody and Buzz Lightyear are the stars and they are witty, brave, and true-blue.  I recommend this video to children and parents alike.
B00003CXA6|2.0|A momentous occasion such as Gettysburg deserves better.  Hmm, let me see if I can guess the formula they used when making this film - Have a big hollywood name, playing a well known figure stare off into the horizon while delivering a monologue.  If not staring off into the horizon, then the figure should be addressing a subordinate.  Now apply this formula for 4 hours.  Intersperse this with battle scenes that are shown several times but are passed off as unique scenes.  <br />Uhhh, I think Meade and Lee where rolling over in their graves when this film was made.
B0000048V8|5.0|It just doesn't get better than this. The Snowman is the tale of a little boy who builds a snowman and the snowman comes to life! The boy brings the snowman in the house and they have fun in the kitchen and bedroom, and then they fly to the North Pole to see Santa Claus. It's all done without dialog and the soundtrack of \\"We're walking in the air...\\" is so wistful and bittersweet, you'll just love it. The drawings have a soft, childlike quality that goes well with the sense of wonder and innocence. The whole story is sentimental, funny, and first-rate. You and your family will love it.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|The remake of the original Classic, \\"The Adventures Of The Time Machine\\" by H.G Wells is an unsuccessful attempt to put the contents of the book into a motion picture. The story starts of well, but as the movie progresses, reality takes a new turn. The monsters or whatever they are called, give an eeire feel to the entire movie. It was then when I realized that this movie is terrible. Okay, some appreceation now. The Computerized graphics are beautiful and so are the sound effetcs. But the movie looses its charm due to its unauthenticity.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers...<BR>One of the best filmed war documentary, if not the best!<BR>Good players, good directing, good story (it matches the reality the best!!!) and certainly very good sets and special effects!!!<BR>Two thumbs up for Tom Hanks and David Frankel and all the other directors.<BR>Also two thumbs up for Stephen E. Ambrose, the author of the book for such a very good story.<BR>I love the TV serie,....<br />Regards,<br />DJ VYRUS
B000069HKH|5.0|Throughout my life, Springsteen has always managed to write songs that seem to speak directly to me.  He has done it again.<br />With such a horrible and painful subject matter as the backdrop, he's been able to capture all the jumble of emotions I've gone through.  And like the best of his albums( Born to Run, Darkness, Born in the USA), there is that message of faith and hope that I'm able to come away with.  There are few songs I can think of that are as heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time as &quot;Into the Fire&quot; is.  <br />I was lucky enough to see him at his opening show at the Meadowlands and these songs come across as well in concert <BR>as any of his older music.  &quot;Mary's Place&quot; and &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; had the place shaking.<br />This CD is simply the best I've gotten in years.
1878424319|1.0|I found this book a complete waste of time.  Luckily it was not very long.  Anyone with a shred of common sense already knows and understands the 4 &quot;agreements&quot; without this book!  What about courtesy for others, right vs. wrong, etc?  Based on the &quot;wisdom&quot; of this book I could decide to be a murderer and feel justified.
B000002BPS|5.0|First off, I am an offspring fan so i am biased. However, as of when i am writing this, the absolute worst ANYONE has rated this CD is 2 stars, so perhaps im not blinded by my admiration of the band. As a fan, i listen to the offspring more than most other bands so my method of determining how good a track is has to do mostly with whether it weathers the effects of time.<br />-Disclaimer 8/10. Its an intro and intros are usually recyclable. This one is witty and i can still laugh (or at least snicker) at it today.<br />-The Meaning of Life 10/10. Powerful and fastpaced song about experiencing things for yourself. Music video is pretty good to.<br />-Mota 8/10. This song builds into a fast song. The lyrics are about marajuana and being trashed. If your a stoner, you'll like this song more than i do. Still a good song.<br />-Me & my Old Lady 10/10. Moderately paced song. Has good bass lines and guitar lines. Lyrics are somewhat sexual in nature.<br />-Cool to Hate 9/10. A song that promotes hating things instead of dealing with them. Its fun to scream to live but sitting at home, i get a bit tired of it.<br />-Leave it behind 7/10. Good song but after a few hundred times hearing it it isnt that interesting anymore (Not enough melodical variation).<br />-Gone Away 10/10. Excellent track. Its a slower song which is a nice break from some of the faster songs. This is one of my all time favorites. The lyrics are about dealing with the loss of a loved one.<br />-I Choose 10/10. I heard this song before i knew who the offspring were. I loved it then, i love it now. Its a story of growing up.<br />-Intermission 1/10. Its an intermission, what can i say.<br />-All I want 10/10. Fast past song following a less than spectacular intermission. Good song with interesting lyrics about wanting to be left alone.<br />-Way Down the Line 9/10. Good song about how we end up repeating the mistakes our parents make.<br />-Dont Pick it Up 2/10. This is the one song on Ixnay i dont like. Itlacks any emotion, its melody is repetative, and its lyrics uninteresting.<br />-Amazed 10/10. Another slow song. It is about futility and depression. The melody is quite good at conveying these two states.<br />-Change the World 9/10. Starts slow and then builds into a fast paced song about doing things for yourself heedless of the world.<br />Overall, the CD is great. Even in my case of having listened to it way more times than is healthy, I can still glean alot of enjoyment from the well constructed, moral laden songs.
B000069HKH|5.0|I was never a fan of the sometimes mindless repetitive sounds of previous Springsteen songs.  I gave him another chance with The Rising and I'm really glad I did.  He's the first to really turn his art toward the tragedy of 9-11.  I can listen to the sadder songs but prefer the hopefulness (almost prayerful) songs of hope such as Worlds Apart, Waitin on a Sunny Day and My City of Ruins.  I expect Worlds Apart to become a hit single.  I love the mix of Asif Ali Khan and his group into Worlds Apart.  It is very reminiscent of Ladysmith Black Mambazo on Paul Simon's Graceland album.  I love to hear the music styles of other worlds melded with our traditional rock n roll.  My City of Ruins has a wonderful sense of gospel melded with rock.  While I appreciate the sadder songs out of respect for what they commemorate, it was Worlds Apart and My City of Ruins that got played twice (three-times, four-times) before progressing to the next song during my first review of the album.
B00005JKJA|4.0|It's hard to believe this film started out as a pilot for a series on ABC (I have no idea why Lynch keeps making material for them, considering their history).<br />It has to be seen to be appreciated - multiple times.<br />Lynch doesn't wrap everything in a nice neat package, for that matter, he never makes any promises that the experience will make sense. It's just art being what it is.<br />However, the import verisons of this DVD (the Korean one is Region 0 so it can be played anywhere) have tons of extras not on the domestic disc! (Which is the ONLY reason this disc doesn't get the full 5 stars.) Namely interviews with the cast... I'll likely be importing it, at additional expense.<br />Now if they'd just hurry the heck up with the Lost Highway and Wild at Heart DVDs...
B000002J6H|4.0|It's really the critic &quot;thing to do&quot; to throw mud at Steve Stills, the guy Richie Furay considered to be the mainspring in Buffalo Springfield and the guy who did most of the playing on the fine first CS&amp;N record.  Granted, he had the ego of the century and it's on display here, as he muddles into attempts at gospel and acoustic blues, but most of this record is pretty fine.  I especially like the superstar cameo tracks here, because the stars play some lovely music.  No surprise; Steve was a terrific musician and he could draw strong performances from other players.  From 1967-9 Stills was one of the big innovators, too.  Least accomplished, my foot!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This was an above average portrayal of what \\"blondes\\" tend to go thru in their lives, but to have someone believe in her for who she is while proving to herself she can do it was very heartwarming.  I enjoyed it with my husband, my neice's children, and several in-laws.  Good entertainment, with a good moral story and a nice finish!
B000065V3M|5.0|Tim Burton's ED WOOD is probably one of his best films to date, showing he doesn't need big budgets and special effects to tell a good story. First and foremost, the underlying theme of this film is the joy of the art of filmmaking.  In Ed Wood's case, inspiration far surpassed the perspiration. Therefore, in this biopic, Wood's optimism and the love of telling a story through film are characterized as a man who wanted to dream way passed his means and abilities as a writer, producer,and director. Also, it doesn't help that he is a cross dresser, an alcoholic, and is surrounded by some very weird people. Johnny Depp again takes on another unconventional role and pulls it off with humor, wit, and eccentricity of the man considered to be the worst director of all time and responsible for PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. However, the outstanding performance is by Martin Landau of Bela Lugosi and deserved the Oscar for his supporting role as the pathetic, aged actor way passed his prime. Some of the scenes from 'Plan 9' are reinacted with great accuracy and loving tribute. Great supporting cast of Patricia Arquette, Sarah Jessica Parker, Bill Murray, wrestler George the Animal Steel, Lisa Marie, Vincent D'Onofrio, and it was nice to see veteran character actor Norman Alden (MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT) as Cameraman Bill.
6305126062|4.0|The interaction between the horse and the horse whisperer is chilling, gives goose bumps,  tender and touches the soul and other senses.  The human story gets out of proportion and somewhat offbeat, however all's well that ends well with  that situation.  All and all this is a film that I could watch at least once  a year.
6304779356|4.0|THE LOST BOYS is probably one of the hippest vampire movies in film history.  It's a shame that the title mirrors the current situation of two of its major stars. Corey Haim's and Corey Feldman's acting careers have somewhat stalled due to personal problems brought on by the Hollywood lifestyle.  Apart from that,  this is a pretty entertaining film by Joel Schumaker (who ruined the Batman franchise).  A divorced Mom, Lucy (Diane Wiest) moves to Santa Carla, murder capital of the world (according to graffitti on a billboard...it's actually Santa Cruz,CA), with her two teenage sons Micheal and Sam (Jason Patric and Corey Haim).  She finds a job...and they find vampires. A group of young vampires headed by David (Kiefer Sutherland) want to recruit David and try to initiate him to the undead. Sam finds out and with the help of the Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman, Jamison Newlander) a couple of comic book fanboys-vampire experts/busters, go out to destroy the vampire menace. Some great action sequences, humor, gore, blood, and a few classic lines (\\"Holy ****!, It's the attack of Eddie Munster!\\"), its a fine film on many levels.  Great cast of newcomers and veterans including Barnard Hughes as the hip, pot smoking Grandpa, Edward Herrmann as Max, the head vampire, and Jamie Gertz as a would be vampiress.  Look for a pre-BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, Alex Winter as one of the teen vampires.

I AM 15 YEARS OLD AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE STEVIE WONDER!SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE IS THE FIRST ALBUM I BOUGHT BY HIM AND I'M SURE GLAD IT WAS BECAUSE IT IS EXCELLENT! MY FAVORITE SONGS ON HERE ARE SIR DUKE(WHICH IS ACTUALY THE MAIN REASON I BOUGHT THE CD), I WISH,SUMMER SOFT,SATURN,BROWN EYES,AS,ISN'T SHE LOVELY,VILLAGE GHETTO LAND AND LOVE'S IN NEED OF LOVE TODAY! MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE WAS THE LAST ALBUM HE EVER BOUGHT BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT AFTER IT NO OTHER ALBUM COULD TOP IT! SOMETIMES I LISTEN TO THE GARBAGE IN SONGS TODAY AND GET SO SICK I JUST PUT ON SOME STEVIE WONDER TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER! SOMETIMES I WISH I LIVED BACK IN THE 70S DURING THE TIME OF STEVIE WONDER. IF ONLY MY GENERATION COULD WRITE LIKE HIM!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Well, if there was anyone in the world that has been waiting for this as long as me I would be surprised. As soon as I watched the first episode, the DVD collection went on my list of \\"Must Haves\\".  <BR>And I wasn't disappointed with the specs, the picture is amazing, the sound pumps, and the features tell a story behind a story.  Everything about this collection is what you expect when buying DVD's. I myself limit my choices to those DVD's loaded with features and this would have to be one of my favorites. <BR>All in all if you haven't seen Band of Brothers yet, see it for the first time with this collection, you won't be disappointed.
067101756X|5.0|Having read the TOP Four books in the UFO/Alien/ Government Coverup Genre; My FAVORITE is 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger (Great fiction-soon to be a movie); and Alien Agenda by the best selling author of 'Crossfire' Jim Marrs (Best reference on UFOlogy); and Unconventional Flying Objects (NASA UFO Investigator for 30 years) by the scientist Dr. Paul Hill, I'd say Corso's book is a MUST READ! <br />Why would a respected, decorated, connected Military Officer swear in a Court of Law that the UFO Conspiracy is real and that the facts and agenda in these books ARE TRUE. <br />Why? If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true. Two well respected American Astronauts have come forward to proclaim they had seen evidence of the Roswell UFO crash and stated they know the cover-up is real. Was his sudden demise a product of this conspiracy? You be the judge.
B000002UAO|5.0|Even though this is my favorite Beatles album, it still contains the only Beatles song that I can't stand, 'You Won't See Me'. But the rest of the album more than makes up for that one song. Definately a must for any Beatles or Music fan.

0679731725|4.0|\\"The Remains of the Day\\", Kazuo Ishiguro's 1989 Booker Prize winning novel, is the slim memoir of Stevens, a lifelong British butler, recounting his glory days before the second World War at the infamous Darlington Hall, while on a road trip through the English countryside.  Or at least that is what a cursory read-through would leave the reader believing.  In fact, it is much more than that.  \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is actually three books in one, a fact that I will now elaborate on.<br />Firstly, it is a fine butler procedural.  \\"Surely it is enough that the likes of you and I,\\" Stevens writes to his ideal reader, \\"at least try to make our small contribution count for something true and worthy.\\"  Having attained a high position in one of England's finer homes, he has had the chance to rub shoulders with not only the most important political figures of the day (he's even met Mr. Churchill), but with some of the finest modern butlers.  Men such as Mr. Graham and Mr. Donalds, names that his reader will most assuredly be familiar.  They not only discuss amongst themselves the various butlering trends of the day (e.g. methods of polishing silver; how to remain constantly at their master's service while remaining out of sight), but also the less tangible characteristics of a good butler, such as dignity and loyalty.<br />On the former characteristic, Stevens gives an example from his father's history, as well as his own that illustrate his notions on the subject of dignity.  His example concerns the Conference of March 1923, an attempt by Lord Darlington to retract the Treaty of Versailles.  Already taxed during this busy weekend, Stevens is further inconvenienced when his father, a legendary butler in his own time now working at Darlington Hall during his waning years, falls gravely ill.  During his father's last moments, Stevens never strays from duty, even going so far as to find fresh bandages for the French delegate's feet.  You will agree that a butler, born to serve, must keep his mind on his duties at all times, personal feelings be damned.<br />As to the second characteristic, loyalty, Stevens maintains that, \\"it is... not possible to adopt... a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service.\\"  Thus, he turns a blind eye to the popular opinion that Lord Darlington more hurt than helped England's cause.  Paradoxically, Stevens doesn't advocate loyalty to an employer obviously not deserving of such.  How does one achieve both goals?  It is a question not even a butler of Stevens' caliber can fully answer, although in asking the question one has taken the first step towards enlightenment.<br />Besides being a butler procedural, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is also a love story.  But not your typical love story, for most of the romance is beneath the surface, hidden from even those involved.  Part of the reason for Stevens' holiday in the country is the desire to be reacquainted with one Miss Kenton, the housekeeper at Darlington Hall during its halcyon days.  She, having just divorced from her husband, may be interested in returning to her former post.  Stevens, never admitting his feelings for Miss Kenton, is excited by this prospect.<br />But why did he not snatch her up when he had the chance?  More apt to do what's good for the house than what's good for himself, Stevens \\"always found such liaisons [two members of the staff deciding to marry one another] a serious threat to the order in a house.\\"  So he represses his feelings.  Much of the memoir's suspense comes from wondering what will happen when Stevens, out of his professional stuffy surroundings, finally meets Miss Kenton again.  I'll not spoil the fun, but will warn the reader to bring along some hankies.  Despite not being a conventional love story, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" succeeds at pulling your heartstrings.<br />Despite the tone I've adopted so far, I suspect a clever reader will have seen through my ruse.  Implications abound above that \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is non-fiction.  Sorry to mislead you, but you see I was trying to make a point.  Just as a reader should not take anything I've said so far at face value, they also should not wholly put their trust in Stevens' words.  For he is, in my opinion, the epitome of the post-modern rhetorical device that I find most fascinating: the unreliable narrator.<br />Stevens thinks he is doing his best to relate the events of his life, and, as a byproduct of this, clear Lord Darlington's name.  But he is too stuffy and too reserved to fully complete his task.  Several moments in the book explicitly point out that he -- intentionally or otherwise -- is hiding the real facts, for they do not support his hypothesis.  When asked by a man helping him with his dry radiator if he, \\"used to work for that Lord Darlington?\\" Stevens implies that he didn't.  Stevens is not able to come up with an answer for why he misled the man, but a perceptive reader will.  Later, after he's spent four pages trying (unsuccessfully) to refute claims of Lord Darlington's anti-Semitism, Stevens realizes he has digressed from what must be the reader's real interest, the trend of meticulous silver polishing.  Unconsciously, he leapt off on a tangent.  When he realized that maybe he was in dangerous territory, he quickly backpedaled.  Very telling.<br />Ishiguro, Japanese born but British bred and educated, captures the prudent voice of the English butler perfectly.  He never falters in his accurate portrayal, to the point where a reader wouldn't be blamed for really thinking this a memoir.  Along with this accuracy comes a story, full of mystery and romance and political intrigue and remorse, that, despite its lack of a propulsive narrative, never ceases to be a page-turner.
B000069CWE|5.0|One there is a follow up album coming out soon for those who go to the (website...) and read the info from the band.  As for this album, it plain and simply ROCKS.  The colaboration with all the D.J.'s to mix up already great songs, makes this album the best remix album ever.  Especially the Aaron Lewis Crawling track.  All those no believers, stay away, for those true, and hard core Linkin Park fans, get this C.D. now, keep it under your pillow at night, and ROCK ON!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This introduction to destruction is only the beginning of the dominance that was Guns-n-Roses!! Everybody likes this particular album and the other ones are great too. The cover art alone says it all and is the greatest album cover of all time!! What else says rock-n-roll like skulls on a cross with ribbons on a black backround? \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" is a killer song played at sports stadiums everywhere,\\"Paradise City\\" is a crowd favorite, and everyone seems to like \\"Sweet Child O' Mine.\\" People forget \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" and \\"Nightrain\\" are also on there. \\"Think About You\\" is a ballad I especially love. \\"You're Crazy\\" is wild and fast. Every song is unique and great and is best enjoyed by playing it loud! An absolute must for hard rock fans and should be on everyone's list! Go buy it now if you haven't already! It's already sold over 20 million copies worldwide, so it must be breathtakingly good! Highly recommended! The best rock album you'll ever see!! A stellar 5-star classic!! The best album. Period. Any questions?
B000062XM7|5.0|I know (because I've discussed it with friends) that I'm not the only woman who was ruined for all other men by Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in this film.  It's not just that he looks good (though he most certainly does), it's the utter conviction each of his actions and words carries, the fact that he can run through a battlefield, dispatching several opponents along the way in a most efficient yet graceful manner, without ever once taking his eyes off Madeleine Stowe's Cora.<br />The movie hinges on Day-Lewis's performance, but as a whole it is also just wonderful.  The scenery is breathtaking and Madeleine Stowe, Jodhi May, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, and Wes Studi all give excellent performances.  It's sort of a traditional Hollywood epic, big and sprawling with huge armies and cannons going off and men in costumes shouting at each other about honor.  But in some ways it's more interesting than that.  The deep love between Nathaniel, Chingachgook, and Uncas is deftly established in a few early scenes and is never absent from any of their later scenes together, though they exchange very little dialogue and much of that not in English.  Those relationships, as much as the one between Nathaniel and Cora, give the movie real emotional richness and keep the ending from seeming melodramatic or cheap.
B000000OSG|5.0|This album kicks butt. \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is my favorite GNR song and is the best one on this album. \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" are also on this classic rock album! Give it a chance and listen for yourself, especially with a pair of headphones with the volume turned up loud and clear!! There are atleast seven great songs on this album, which is more than I can say about most albums out there today. It's nice to see a great group like this who know how to actually play their instruments!! Guns-n-Roses is the best rock group, period, and you can see why by listening to this album!! Do yourself a favor and go buy this 5-star album now!!! Chinese Democracy starts now!! :)

I remember watching it over and over, and even today, I have not grown tired of this fantasy movie.  If you've seen moves from the mid 80's, some of the scenes and music is SO wrong and distorted!~  You will be impressed with the costumes, the make up, and even the music of the times is represented. This movie stars Tom Cruise [not too corny], Mia Sara [not too sweet], and Tim Curry [just a bit frightening]. If you like faeries, sprites, demons, unicorns, this is a great movie.  kids love it!~

Although I was forced to see it when my sister and my mom were dying to see it, which would result in leaving me home alone. So I went to see it, planning to sleep in the theatre but... TADA! I love this movie! The first scene attracted me with Travola's cinematic theory and the \\"bullet-time\\" explosion, which was very awesome. <br />This movie definately is worth to see , buy \\"Swordfish\\" and expect great things with Berry's nudity!
0316666343|4.0|When I first started this book, I did love it. I was misty-eyed several times in a chapter, was heartbroken by the girl's innocent writing, was interested in the place she now called Heaven, and liked to hear about those she left behind. And to the end of the novel, I loved the writing and the dialogue, and I was still hoping that the character's murderer would face some sort of justice. But, then, after years and years passed...<BR>It became sort of long. The book seemed to be going nowhere in particular, and though I did not grow bored at any time - I grew somewhat impatient. Where was this going? Was this all necessary?<BR>Well, no it wasn't. In the end, there was a sort of resolution. But, it didn't need to be as long as it was. And to tell the truth, the character's reuniting with her life 'boyfriend' seemed sort of strange, as she always seemed like that 14-year-old girl, and not a day older. <BR>So, it was worth the read, but not the perfect novel.
B000002KNY|4.0|Fear of Music finds Talking Heads wielding some of their best riffs while crunching through the set like crazed auditors on the trail of the next big corporate collapse. The guitars and  keyboards never sounded cleaner, and the bass and drums are solid, dense, propelling. Undeniably, Eno exerts his influence providing his trademarked \\"treatments\\" but more importantly drawing the band into new directions, culminating on the next Talking Heads recording, \\"Remain in Light.\\"<br />Whether the rest of the Heads liked it or not, the synergy between Eno and Byrne clicked here on most tracks, though Drugs sounds like a dirge these days, and Electric Guitar gets skipped in my CD player. (Many other reviewers have done great encapsulations of the songs themselves, and anything I could add would likely echo what's been stated.)<br />Music aside, it's fun to see how the art-school influence of the band members surfaces in the cover design, black crisscrossed metal suggesting something lean and mean, something industrial perhaps complimented by a skinny typeface suggesting nervousness. And that is ultimately the feeling one gets, a certain edginess like the feeling from one-too-many cups of strong coffee or suddenly noticing the cop car looming in your rearview mirror or getting metal splinters in your fingertips.<br />This same energy carries over into the abbreviated song titles (no title has more than three words, and seven of the eleven are one-word titles, suggesting haste over deliberation. (Reminds me of the titles the Sugarcubes used or is it vice-versa?)<br />Yet the overall effect----of music, design, titles---is not one of haste but of craft merging on several levels.<br />Bottom line: Essential documentation of Talking Heads as they neared their pinnacle.
6305878323|5.0|Floating in on the East Wind, the mysterious and magical Mary Poppins arrives at the door of the Banks family to take on the position of nanny to the two Banks children, Jane and Michael. Their workaholic father and politically preoccupied mother have no time to waste raising their children, nor do they feel they need to. It's simply another position to hire for as far as they're concerned. But Mary Poppins puts her magical powers to good use by teaching the Banks parents that missing out on their children's childhood is a mistake they'll never be able to take back. Along with her Chimney sweeping friend, Bert, Mary takes the children into a magical, cartoon world within a chalk pavement drawing, where they attend a fair, ride in a horse race, and take part in a fox hunt. Later, they have a tea party on the ceiling at Uncle Albert's and play Step In Time on the London rooftops with a wild band of Chimney Sweeps. But when father tries to teach the children some responsibility by taking them on a field trip to the Bank where he works, his lack of understanding and experience causes things to get out of hand, and Mr. Banks is fired soon after. It's only after a conversation with Bert, the surprisingly wise chimney sweep, that Mr. Banks learns the error of his ways, and how Mary Poppins' only intentions were to help bring the family together. All works out in the end though, and the rest is Disney history!<br /> Hailed as Walt's greatest theatrical achievement, one certainly can't argue the point after seeing this film. It's \\"practically perfect in every way!\\" The Sherman Brothers outdid themselves, as usual, in the songwriting tasks, and the casting is some of Disney's best. The beautiful backdrops are completely amazing, especially after watching the behind the scenes featurette to see how they were accomplished. There simply isn't ANYTHING bad to say about this astounding picture! The extras are quite nice too. You get the behind the scenes featurette I just mentioned, a theatrical trailer, a trivia game, and footage of the Hollywood premiere of the film. Sure, there could have been a lot more extras, but for a Disney DVD this is actually quite a bit. If you don't already have this film on DVD, you should be kicking yourself right now!

B000067UUJ|4.0|The quest for world domination continues. Here is Muse's third instalment of progressive, heavy rock. This time it's a double CD of B-sides and live songs. First, the B-sides. It must be said that Muse have a fairly set sound, and a lot of their songs sound fairly similar. Upon closer inspection, you will notice that it is mainly Matt Bellamy's voice that causes this effect. This is more evident that ever on the B-sides album. Many of these songs experiment further away from their album tracks. Opener Forced In is spaced out and eerie rather than in-your-face, and Map of Your Head is a sprightly, major-chord formed ditty, complete with medieval acoustic guitar, yet Matt Bellamy's voice causes them to sound like trademark Muse all the same.<br />There's no denying it, Muse's B-sides are not as strong as their album tracks, generally. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Whilst it does mean that this B-side album is nowhere near as good as last year's Origin of Symmetry, it at least means that they are selecting the right tracks for their albums. In this way B-sides albums are a bit of a no-win situation: if they are only average, they are criticised as substandard and if they are excellent the band are criticised for not making them album tracks. <br />Not that there aren't good efforts here. The aforementioned Map of Your Head is very enjoyable, whilst Shrinking Universe is classic Muse and standout Nature_1 has the strongest tune on the CD. Generally though, this collection doesn't bear the killer hooklines that Origin of Symmetry, or, indeed, Showbiz did, whilst being enjoyable and worth owning, so CD1 gets 3 stars.<br />The live CD is a different matter. Muse are an intense band. Everything about their music is intense. And intense bands are excellent live. Muse are no exception. Live CDs tend to either be interesting variations on the recorded versions with added intensity but played comparatively poorly, with the singer missing notes, or well played, but no different to the studio recordings. Here Muse manage to avoid either trap, managing to sound live and intense while playing very professionally.<br />Here you can hear how well the trio work together, with bass more audible than on studio recordings, as they sometimes hit little periods of improvisation. Variations are added to the songs: the guitar riff on Muscle Museum is made more complex, while Micro Cuts is taken at a faster and more natural pace, and epics Citizen Erased and Megalomania hit their peaks and valleys with even more passion than on Origin of Symmetry: one of the finest moments of Hullabaloo being as Citizen Erased quietens down after its loudest sections, with Matt Bellamy beautifully handling the vocals, in a wonderfully exhausted sort of way.<br />It is credit to Bellamy's fantastic singing that he can manage the incredibly high notes and difficult techniques just as easily live as in the studio. The only time he seems slightly pressed is on recent non-album single Dead Star, though this is fully explainable by the fact that they had not actually recorded it at the time, and so had not benefited from the producer's input over how the song should sound, and they are evidently not quite done working on it at the time of the recording. Still, even this track is fantastic. Therefore, CD2 is nothing short of brilliant, and it gets 4 1/2 stars.
B00003ZA27|4.0|Perhaps slow in pace compared to some versions, but reveals the inner detail and beauty of the Mass superbly.  Worth owning just for the Benedictus
0792140346|5.0|Martin Vale (Richard Gere) eats, sleeps and breathes the law. As a defense attourney he is feared and hated by every prosecutor in Chicago. Why? Because he's that good. He's known for his rough tactics as well as his brilliant performances in the courtroom. He loves being in court as much as he loves seeing his name in print and his face on the evening news. He believes \\"that a person is innocent until proven guilty\\" and believes in the basic goodness in people. He simply loves the law.<br />When Chicago's beloved Archbishop Rushman is stabbed to death (78 times) in his rectory and a blood-soaked alter boy (Edward Norton) is arrested as the prime and only suspect, Vail can't resist being the first to offer his services - pro bono. Aaron Stampler is the 19-year-old alter boy who claims he didn't kill the Archbishop. He says he was in the room at the time of the murder, but that there was a third person there and he blacked out. His stuttering Kentucky mountain accent and angelic boy scout look is only the beginning to a great defense.<br />Janet Venable (Laura Linney), a former girlfriend of Vail, is the prosecutor assigned to this case. I think she's looking forward to butting heads with Vail again. Her bosses want the death penalty and nothing less.<br />Based on the novel of murder and suspense by William Diehl, we've got a truly star-studded jackpot with \\"Primal Fear.\\" The characters were so well written in the book, it must not have been too difficult to convert to film. It's easy to love and/or hate each character.<br />Richard Gere is always brilliant, putting everything he's got into each role. This character, Martin Vail, reminds me of his Edward Lewis in \\"Pretty Woman.\\" He loves his job, actually lives it, makes a ton of money, is very arrogant, confident, brilliant, very charming, clever, persuasive and thorough. First-class performance.<br />Edward Norton got the role of a lifetime when he landed this character, Aaron Stampler - the role that put him on the Hollywood map. When actors are too good, they sometimes pay the price with me. Norton was a little TOO good and a little TOO convincing here. I hated him. His role in \\"Keeping the Faith,\\" with Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman, was where he redeemed himself. (I love him now.) \\"Keeping the Faith\\" was also his directorial debut. More great performances from Norton in \\"Rounders\\" and \\"Fight Club.\\" Also, if you liked him in \\"Primal Fear,\\" you must see \\"The Score\\" (also starring Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando). You'll see some similarities that I'm not at liberty to discuss. Just trust me!<br />A slew of other great actors are in \\"Primal Fear:\\" LAURA LINNEY of \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" (with Richard Gere), \\"Congo,\\" and \\"Absolute Power\\" (played Clint Eastwood's daughter). JOHN MAHONEY is a corrupt city official here who's a long-time friend of the late Archbishop. Mahoney plays the father in TV's \\"Frasier,\\" and was also in \\"The American President\\" (Annette Bening's boss), \\"Eight Men Out,\\" \\"She's the One,\\" and played Judge Helms in \\"Suspect.\\" FRANCES MCDORMOND, who later won an Oscar for her 1996 performance in \\"Fargo,\\" also starred in \\"Raising Arizona,\\" \\"Mississippi Burning\\" and \\"Wonder Boys.\\" Also watch for ANDRE BRAUGHER (\\"City of Angels,\\" \\"Glory,\\" \\"Frequency\\"), MAURA TIERNEY (TV's \\"ER,\\" \\"Liar, Liar,\\" \\"Primary Colors,\\" \\"Forces of Nature,\\" \\"Oxygen\\") and JOE SPANO (\\"Apollo 13,\\" \\"Hart's War\\").
B00005QIPH|4.0|...that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen! That applies to both my review of this album and to the album itself.  I realize most people have read so many Strokes reviews they could vomit, but, that said, you should still read mine. :) (I feel I owe it to these guys to put in a good word; this album helped me through a really horrible sophomore year.)<br />If you decide to pick up a copy of Is This It, keep in mind that none of it will sound groundbreaking.  Bands such as the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, and Television created this sound way back when in the 60's/70's.  If you haven't heard the three aforementioned bands, I suggest you go out and sample their albums before you hop on the Strokes bandwagon.  It's history lesson that'll do you good.<br />Just because the Strokes are not the most original band out there does not mean you should ignore this album.  It's fun, there are plenty of catchy songs, and let's face it: these guys just exude coolness.  They're sexy, even if it is a sexiness with a bit more hype and studio sheen than most self-respecting indie kids will instantly accept.<br />Also, it's important to remember that this is only their debut album, so let's not pass judgment on the basis of their first eleven songs.  There are two possibilities for the future of the Strokes.  Either their sound will stagnate as they rest on the laurels of Is This It, or, they will mature and begin to develop their own persona and prove to the world that they're more than just a bunch of angsty rich kids.  Personally, I hope to see the latter.
B000066NW0|4.0|Pop music has been dying for an artist like Avril Lavigne.  Not only does she write her own music, she performs it live too using...get this...instruments!  AAAGGHHH!!!  For those people who enjoy good, personal lyrics and a fun time.  Get this CD!  Now I'll rate each song<br />1. Losing Grip - (3.5/5) Good guitar.  Obviously very mad when she wrote this one.<BR>2. Complicated - (4/5) Well, it was a 5/5 the first 500 times I heard it.<BR>3. Sk8er Boi - (5/5) Fun punk about going for what ya want.<BR>4. Mobile - (4/5) THis song really grows on you.  A good song for graduates too. Go class of '02<BR>5. Unwanted - (4/5) Awesome, guitar driven song, great chorus.  <BR>6. Tomorrow - (3/5) One of my less favorite songs on the CD, but a nice sullen ballad.<BR>7. Anything But Ordinary - (5/5) Unbelievable beautiful rock singing by Avirl.  Gave me the chills.<BR>8. Things I'll Never Say - (2.5/5) My least fav song on the CD, a little too girly for me.<BR>9. My World - (4/5) Any suburbanite will appreciate this song.<BR>10. Nobody's Fool - (4/5) Avril raps a little bit, which is fun.  Memorable line: \\"I've got a backbone stronger than yours.\\"<BR>11. Too Much to Ask - (3/5) Pretty good song, nothing really special about it.<BR>12. Naked (3.5/5) - [stinks] that Jennifer Love Hewitt came up with a song so similar coz this might have been a cool single.
B00005OAA6|5.0|I didn't like Spice Girls, I hated their music.But when I first listened to Victoria's album I didn't believed she could sing and write so well. This album cost to Virgin $10,000,000 to be created so you understand its quality. All the songs are GREAT but the A mind of its own,Girlfriend,Innocent girls and Watcha talkin'about are the best. The lyrics are so realistic and, honestly, Victoria shows in this album that she has an important reason existing in pop music where very little artists appreciate,support and create good music. The reason that this album didn't have a huge success-and Virgin dropped her-is because maqazines and reviews and critics made people believe that she doesn't have any talents and believe me it's not true.
B00005Y228|5.0|More More More- good dance song, like the chorus, not one of my favorites though<br />Love At First Sight-My favorite album on the track, this song just makes me want to get up and jump around, although i do think the single version is better than the album version<br />Can't Get You Out of My Head-well of course I like this one, im sure everyone has heard it, it's the reason I bought the album in the first place, great catchy dance song<br />Fever-I love this song!!!  Great title track, that has a slow funky beat to it<br />Give it to Me- very catchy song and funky, one of the best songs on the album<br />Fragile-another great song, one that should be a single in the states i think, i also love the lyrics, good meaning<br />Come Into My World- sounds more like her previous album i think, but a very good song<br />In Your Eyes-One of the best songs on the album, definatley a hit :)<br />Dancefloor-As sad at it is, Im not really a fan of this one, it just doesn't hit me like the other ones <br />Love Affair-Great song, I definately think it should be the next single, it's very dancy and has great lyrics to it<br />Your Love-not really a slow song, but probably one of the slowest ones you'll find on the album, i love the lyrics, but not a big fan of the music itself<br />Burning Up- Great song to blast real loud and belt it out, also very good for club dancing
B00006690G|4.0|The lat CD has more shocking rhymes. Not much point in trying to hide this from my parents (its was pretty fun). Only about 4 good songs. Get it, its good for your collection, just dont expect to listen to it much.

0380729407|4.0|When I put down this book yesterday, two-thirds of the way through, I was pretty sure it was the best book I had ever read on the subject of death. If not death, then the peculiar phantasm of death paraded by the ghoulish, the morbid, the interminably gasping, and the paranoid. There could be no more perfect metaphor for the fascination and terror death holds for us, than the carnival. Swooping in, strange, exhilarating, mysterious, dangerous, and familiar; overwhelming and sometimes nauseating.<br />Bradbury's style for this novel makes heavy use of metaphor and simile, sentence fragments, and slang, which are often incongruous and insensible; at first this is annoying, largely because it seems like an affectation, but there are moments in his stream of images and phrases where all the disparate elements flow together and what's left, whether it makes sense or not, is really beautiful.<br />The same can be said for the spates of philosophizing, shuffled in and out of the story as we explore the allure of the carnival, and the weaknesses of it's victims. After having researched urban legends, ghost stories, and various real acts of evil for the last few months, I tend to agree with his assertions (filtered through the character of Charles Halloway) about fear and death in particular. And having been a William (unnervingly good), and a Jim (fascinated with, inured by the macabre), and a Charles (trying to rationalize a world where both exist), I also tend to sympathise with Bradbury's views on humanity. Yes he does go on, (or as Jim Nightshade says \\"You talk a lot.\\") but he has something to say, even if it is wedged into a stream-of-consciousness style that is not wholly decipherable, or one-hundred percent the truth. What doesn't work, for me, and wholly forgivable for a book from the '60s, is the dated male perspective which shadows Charles' discussions of love and compassion, which makes it seem like women exist only to be a man's emotional consciousness; forgivable, but still somewhat disruptive to an otherwise interesting discursion.<br />Now, the last third of the book. Perfectly suspenseful, somewhat satisfying, until the very end, which seemed mealy and saccharine compared to the subtly textured, fair-food substantialness of the rest of the book. Like having Spielberg direct the last ten minutes of a David Lynch film.<br />In summary, a good book, but not for horror fans, certainly not for people who insist on direct communication, who are flummoxed by effuse evocation. Definitely for someone who can appreciate the simplicity of small town life, and the difference between the percieved and real dangers of the unknown.le, but still somewhat disruptive to an otherwise interesting discursion. <br />Now, the last third of the book.

B000001FAW|5.0|Love So Right is the most sweet voiced, tuned, sung, and produced BeeGees song. But it also has other beautiful hits like Children of The World, You Stepped Into My Life, and the disco You Should Be Dancing. Can't Keep A Good Man Down is also awesome, but no song on this album is boring. Do not DARE miss it!
B000069HKH|4.0|...I have given this disc several spins in my CD player at home and in the car, and find it to be - for the most part - a compelling, intriguing, haunting, thought-provoking, and enjoyable collection of songs. Again... I caution the listener to not evaluate \\"The Rising\\" based on comparisons to \\"Born To Run\\" or \\"Born In The USA\\". It is an easy trap to fall into, given this is the first studio work Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band have recorded in nearly twenty years. But \\"The Rising\\" is a unique album in the Bruce Springsteen discography. It isn't meant to be evaluated with his classic work, because I don't think that was the intent. What was crafted here is more a tribute to the heroes - living and dead - of September 11. It shows a more contemplative and introspective side of Mr. Springsteen, and was not meant to be a arena-rock staple. I'd be willing to bet that if Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band record again, it will fall in that category. But until then, enjoy \\"The Rising\\" as a stand-alone work of art. It is easily one of the best releases of 2002, and over the test of time, will surely be a defining disc in his collection.<br />I give this a four-star rating for its lyrical brilliance and overall enjoyment. The only minor criticisms that prevent this from a full five-star rating are a few minor instances of lyrical repetitiveness and the \\"unseemly\\" (by Bruce Springsteen standards) use of a canned R&B backbeat on a couple of tracks.
B00005QXXO|4.0|When I first got this CD I scanned the tracks and wasnt tremendously impressed. Then I actually played it through. I think true love waits is a little overrated, but it's good. The version of the aptly chosen title track I Might Be Wrong is awesome and sets you right into the crowd.  I feel that the REAL reason to own this CD is the live version of of IDIOTEQUE. I've never heard so much energy out of Radiohead and the crowd is assisting the crashing beat of Thom's lyrics. Its what a live track should be about. Like all the other Radiohead CD's you own, you will end up considering this one indespensible too.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is one insane movie. I think it takes an insane person to even make a movie like this. It starts out really dull. Edward Norton's voice over is incredibly annoying. The movie picks up as soon as he meets Brad Pitt. But then the movie goes from entertaining to absolutely crazy! Norton and Pitt start a fight club. The members of fight club turn into a gang and vandalize the neighborhood. Quickly after that, the fight club has members all over the country and has turned into more of an army. The army's goal is to blow up the buildings of the major credit card companies. The cops don't care because they are part of this terrorist organization. In the end you find out that there is no Brad Pitt. If you want to know why you'll have to see the movie. Anyway, this is like a movie version of the Twilight Zone and I loved it.
B000001EYW|5.0|The One Night Only concert is packed with hits. But so is this album, released in the same year. Alone, I Surrender, Smoke And Mirrors, and Irresistible Force rock, all in their own ways. Also, I Could Not Love You More and Still Waters are entertaining. The other slow ballads, like Miracles Happen, My Lover's Prayer, and I Will are well sung, and Closer Than Cloose and with my Eyes Closed are two of the &quot;extras&quot;, but are still good.
B00004Z459|5.0|Todays' talent has one problem...they sing with no emotion! Half of it sounds like they are reading it straight from a script! However, linkin park has more then enough emotion and rhythem to counter any shortcomings they may have. One song in paticular is &quot;In the End&quot;. Anytime i listen to the song it makes me realize no matter how others have done me wrong I try to let it slide because In the end...well... it doesn't matter.<BR>One gripe is that they did not include &quot;My December&quot; which is an amazingly harmonious song which was created with deep saddness.
B000003EUL|5.0|Unlike David Bryson, most mortals who have been fortunate enough to hear his concerts or recordings revel in the technical and interpretive brilliance of Richter's pianism. There is simply never an inauthentic note.  Unlike many virtuosi, Richter would simply refuse to play a piece if he felt he could not add something new to the way it was being played.  By contrast with the pedestrian and banal interpretations of the Appassionata by Brendel and Serkin, for example, Richter's simply glows from within.  To have heard it is to have one's conceptions about the piece transformed. His intelligence and sincerity allow it to be heard as never before.  (I cannot conceive how anyone would think this interpretation is \\"wrong,\\" much less quote that great music critic Margaret Thatcher, unless he has some weird bias against beauty!)  The Brahms concerto, moreover, is not only unified, as some reviewers have it, but lifted conceptually and aesthetically to a new level, above any other performance. Richter's ability to lose himself to the music makes him a remarkable interpreter of every composer he has ever played, regardless of age or style - whether Bach, Prokofiev, Chopin, Beethoven, Liszt, Schumann, Brahms, Moussorgsky, Scriabin, Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky or Mozart.  Unlike Horowitz (of whom Richter aptly remarked that he had a great talent and a trivial mind), Richter does not infuse the music with his own romantic sensibilities, but brings out its immanent greatness and originality so that its potential is fully realized. This is the opposite of egotism, and the key to Richter's genius.  The Richter/Leinsdorf Brahms Second and the Appassionata have no peer for sheer emotional power, intelligence, technical brilliance, structure and scope.  The sound is also quite good, especially by comparison with many Richter recordings.  Brahms would have loved this recording.
0800177177|4.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula isn't quite the exact adaptation of the novel version.  While it is fairly good, as well as shortened and all that, Coppola decided to throw in the romance between Dracula and Mina, which NEVER happens in the book.  In fact, in the book, we never know about Dracula's past.  However, I suppose this is the closest version to Bram Stoker's than any other film.  It's quite good.  Winona Ryder and Gary Oldman really rock the movie (of course, since Im a huge Winona Ryder fan).  <br />I'd definitely recommend this to anyone.
B000001FE0|3.0|From all BeeGees albums, I would say this one makes you the most curious once you purchase it. Songs like Never Say Never Again, Suddenly, First of May, Sound of Love, and Melody Fair are incredible. But the rest of the songs make it sound like they just sat down in their studio and whatever popped into their head, they produced right away. But some of the songs are still pretty good. Those three classical tunes I really don't listen to. But not a bad cd for 17 songs.
B00003CX95|5.0|In the late 13th century, William Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland after living away from his homeland for many years. The king of Scotland has died without an heir to the throne and the king of England, a ruthless pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, has seized the throne. Wallace becomes the leader of a ramshackle but courageous army determined to vanquish the greater English forces and restore freedom to Scotland. Wallace's courage and passion unite Scotland in this epic film.<br />In the lat 20th century, Mel Gibson stars on both sides of the camera, playing the lead role plus directing and producing this brawling, richly-detailed saga of fierce combat, tender love, and the will to risk all that is precious for something more precious: freedom. Braveheart is the winner of five Acamedy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Braveheart is an outstaning historical drama and one of the most spectacular and entertaining film in years. Braveheart is a movie not to be missed by anyone, which is why I recommend this to everyone.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|A collection of some of his greatest hits, all live and remastered for an excellent sounding finish. Would highly recommend to any Bob Marley fan! No doubt his best live recording!
B000002HRE|5.0|In most other circumstances, Metallica's 1997 release \\"Reload\\" would be labelled a mere immitation of the previous year's \\"Load.\\" However, these thirteen deep heavy metal tracks were recorded in the same time period as its predecessor, so it's no surprise (or flaw) that \\"Reload\\" echoes its companion.<br />Here, Metallica shows the same poignancy in heavy metal progression, both musically and lyrically. But the sister-album to \\"Load\\" possesses a more three-dimensional sound, using well produced vocal stylings and otherwise limited guitar instrumentation to present a full array of metal that is almost too fantastic to be true. This surrealism is clear with the vocally broad 'Where the Wild Things Are' and the grave sneering irony of 'The Memory Remains.' Of course there are the straight forward metal songs (if slightly inconsistent by the album's terms), most notably 'Fuel,' 'Fixxxer,' and 'Better Than You' which compliment the album's innovations (which were not well received by some fans). Those heavier \\"headbangers\\" help balance the classic rock-styled 'Carpe Diem Baby,' and 'The Unforgiven II,' the sequel to the original song from Metallica's self-titled 1991 album. This sequel comes close to sounding like late-nineties mainstream, but Metallica maintains their dignity, overshadowing the close call to conformity. 'Slither' contains a fine arrangement, while the album's highlight 'Low Man's Lyric' sounds as if Edgar Allan Poe formed his own heavy metal band. There are many other tracks like 'Prince Charming,' 'Devil's Dance,' 'Bad Seed' and 'Attitude' that are drawn out and dull, but still keep up the pace with both Metallica's roots and progression (also preventing me from giving \\"Reload\\" four stars instead of five).<br />At first, it seems logical that the band could have simply released a double album consisting of \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload.\\" But one soon doubts the stability of that idea when they see that the perfection in surrealism sets \\"Reload\\" apart from its predecessor in musical terms, yet still keeping it a perfect match in the principles of heavy metal.decessor in musical terms, yet still keeping it a perfect match in the principles of heavy metal.

B00003CXRM|5.0|The Cohen brothers are gaing a reputation as a duo that has a nack for producing films that are both solid and funny. O' Brother Where Art Thou?, does not fall short st all. It is a very funny romp and the Acamedy thought so too. O' Brother Where Art Thou?, was nominated for two Acamedy awards and robbed of both. It was nominated for Best Screenplay and Best Cinemotography. <br />The story follows three prisioners that become disenchanted by the daily drudge of crushing rocks on a prision farm in Mississippi, the dapper, silver-tongued Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) heads up the jail break. The problem is that they are still shackeled together from when they were in a chain gang- bad tempered Pete (John Turturro) and sweet, dim-witted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing to loose and a buried loot to gain-before it's lost forever in a flood-the three embark on the adventure of a lifetime in this hillariuos offbeat road comedy. Populated with quirky characters (as seen in the Cohen brothers othe masterpiece Fargo), including a blind prophet, sexy sirens, and a one-eyed Bible salesmen (Johm Goodman), it's an odyssey filled with chases, close calls, near misses, and betrayel that should be missed by anyone. O' Brother Where Art Thou? will leave you laughing at every outragous and suprising plot twist this film has to offer.
B000067CPX|1.0|Too much melody.  To much scar tissue, ala under the bridge.  After the first song, Flea pretty much disappears on this CD.  The songs seem to mesh into one long downer.  There is none of the energy or sexuality I am used to hearing - there is no Rose Peacok or Naked in the Rain to be found.  And while I like John Frusciante as a guitarist, I more interested in listening to his percussive wanking and free-form guitar work than his attempts at reggae, pop, soft rock, jazz, country melody, etc.  The lyrics may have a lot of emotional depth to them, but maybe Anthony has taken one to many forays into his own emotional baggage.  The change in style doesn't help Anthony's singing either.  Rather it exposes how weak his singing is. After four or five songs, I was wondering when he would rap abit, but he never does - and Anthony unfortunately is barely able to carry the melodies.  If you like that sort of melody stuff, I reccomend listening to Elton John or someone else. The Peppers used to be about wildness and sex and funk.  Maybe the Peppers grew up.  Too bad.  If you like the Peppers who gave us Give it Away, you won't find much on the CD to like.  If you want to hear Scar Tissue played over and over - you'll love it. You would be better off buying Blood Sugar Sex Magic (even if you already have it) and playing that CD again.  I did.  Now that is the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  This is....something else.
B000002HMH|5.0|\\"Load\\" is the album that set Metallica apart from all other metal bands to emerge from the early 80's (that excludes hair metal). Aside from sticking to their extremely predictable, dull, and uninspired heavy crunch riffed tunes about war, the electric chair, and insane asylums (as they did all throughout the eighties), the foursome expands the musical limitations all too often displayed with heavy metal music, while avoiding conformity and without losing their roots (apparent on 'Wasting My Hate,' 'Thorn Within,' and countless other places even in songs that display a difference from metal).<br />Usually, I'm no Metallica fan and don't expect much from most of their offerings (with a few exceptions). But \\"Load\\" still leaves me transfixed to this day, maybe even moreso than when I bought it in 1996. And if the album can make a fan out of a skeptic like me, that must mean something. The ominous progression and sheer musical growth astounds me--'Ronnie' and '2x4' are some of the heaviest rhythm & blues I've ever heard, while 'Mama Said' and the powerfully moving 'Hero of the Day' leave behind any doubts that Metallica can play a good, lighter song. 'The House Jack Built' is flawless and affecting, right up there with other heart wrenching metal tracks like 'Until it Sleeps,' 'The Outlaw Torn' and of course 'Bleeding Me.' Some spots even show a transition from heavy metal to slighter hard rock ('Cure,' 'Poor Twisted Me,' 'King Nothing'). As if all this weren't enough, \\"Load\\" also reveals the peak point of lyricism for the band (due mostly to singer James Hetfield).<br />Though it showed a true depth of musical advances, \\"Load\\" came as a disappointment to many Metallica fans. These were the fans that believed Metallica just wasn't Metallica without predictable unchanging riffs and the growl of lines like \\"We all shall die,\\" so naturally the less-limited \\"Load\\" gave those fans disillusionment (or maybe it was just because the band cut their hair). But if they want to hear the same trite crunch-crunch metal, then so be it--the rest of us will enjoy hearing Metallica stretch the limits of heavy metal.he same trite crunch-crunch metal, then so be it--the rest of us will enjoy hearing Metallica stretch the limits of heavy metal.

B00003CXCD|5.0|I cannot believe those who think GREGORY PECK was miscast in this movie as leading man!

GREGORY PECK did a fabulous job here and one of his more memorable classic roles in a very long running career.
B000069CWE|5.0|Usually remix CD's are just a way for the band to make their music into bad rhythms like Limp Bizkit's New Old Songs.  That CD was pathetic.  But Linkin Park's Reanimation is something so different that every song on it is nothing but dance grooves and heavy hard rock beats/rap beats.  I think this Remix CD is the best I've heard in a long time.  Reanimation is just one step ahead of putting two things together...rap/rock or everyone could call it nu metal.  But Linkin Park puts every type of genre of music together which makes it great.  On the CD, bassist Phoenix plays very very well on Cello and Violin.  I've never heard better things by him than now.  Having rap artists remix your songs just seems to make it better for the CD.  My favorite track on the CD is 1stp Klosr feat. The Humble Brothers and Jon Davis of Korn.  It's so heavy that Korn could cover that song and make it harder than ever.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this CD a 9.9.  Keep up the work Linkin Park, can't wait for the next album out.

B00005JKTF|4.0|First, the negative points. With those out of the way, we proceed with the meat. The director should have eliminated the very appropriate criticisms of languages and accents in the dialog. Hey, with closed captions we can make clear what is said without sacrificing the accents that lend authenticity. <BR>LET THE GERMANS SPEAK GERMAN (WHICH THEY DID) AND THE FRENCH SPEAK FRENCH (WHICH THEY DID NOT) AND THE ENGLISH SPEAK ENGLISH (WHICH THEY MORE OR LESS DID SPEAK). AND WITH THESE FAIRLY SIMPLE PROBLEMS, SOLVE THEM. USE LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATIONS AND INSINUATIONS AS THEY SHOULD BE USED. DO NOT ASK THE VIEWER TO SUSPEND ALL PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY.

0784011796|3.0|this movie was very disturbing. perhaps one of the most disturbing films I have ever viewed. i liked how it was shot, in 16mm black and white film, giving it an 'indie' approach, and due to its opaque themes and colours, making the movie a lot more disquieting. <BR><BR>the movie is about an antisocial, psychotic, reclusive mathematician, Max Cohen, who sees patterns in everything, and tries to come up with a 216 digit number to describe the pattern of the stock market. while Hasitic Jews lead him to find this number to define the true meaning of God, and some near-stalker business tycoon wants him to find the equation to make some major bang in the stock market. yes, he was brilliant. yes, he was a genius, but the man had no personality whatsoever. there were times when he went through spells of migranes, head trauma, and sometimes vehement outbursts of frustration, even so much as to look for a dirty piece of paper with a rejected idea in a smelly garbage can in New York City. of course he was tortured, but he seemed to have no compassion for the outside world, and his trauma was only caused by the failure of his intelligence, therefore meaning that I had no sympathy for him. <BR><BR>the film didn't even have a climax. it was just one thing after another, even leading to the same scenes a few times over to show him having a fit or a major headache! I knew that one way or another, Max would self-destruct. ... this movie is proof that emotions count more than intelligence. not a bad debut for a director who uses great cinematography (Darren Aronofsky), but his directorial debut was missing something his next movie (Requiem For A Dream) that would have me create any sense of compassion for his characters: some human-like qualities, and emotions.

0141301066|2.0|At first I thought this would be a good girl's book for Story Time, but I'm sorry to say that it's not so good. None of the mature female characters are good role models: Miss Honey is wimpy, The Trunchbull is cruel, The Mother is indifferent (the Father and Brother, bullies); what's here for a girl to look forward to in adulthood? Nothing good, I daresay.    Dahl's rather bizarre idea of girl empowerment encompasses petty revenge and telekinesis; hardly what ordinary girls in the real world can depend on for life skills.    One might say, \\"Lighten up, it's just a book for fun.\\" But I suspect that kids or young teens who identify with this book have experienced what Matilda has, and need to find more uplifting literature.
B00005B6C9|2.0|THIS IS AN OK ALBUM IF YOURE 50YRS OLD ,MALE AND HAVE A MOTORCYCLE.I AM NOT! IT MAKES YOU WISH YOU HAD A BUTTON ON YOUR CD PLAYER TO CHANGE VOCALS And melodies etc, especially the twee wedding day! i like just in case though, as premiered on keppel road.
0800130952|1.0|The best that can be said is that it's a faithful albeit Americanized version of Dahl's book.<br />Slapstick violence, dark authoritarian cruelty and familial abuse, petty revenge, high suspense; I can see why Mr. DeVito took this one on, because this movie, like his other films, curses the darkness (even as it endorses it by exhibition) instead of praising the light.<br />As fodder for children under, say 25 years old, it's way out of line, with nothing to redeem it. Even Dahl's message of &quot;salvation&quot; through classic literature is all but lost here.  And the telekinetic shtick always was a cop-out.<br />I'd buy the Madeline DVD/VHS instead - it is a REAL girl-positive movie, and stands up well to repeated viewings.

0553573403|4.0|I haven't read the second and the third volume but it seems very promising so far. I rate the plot more than excellent and few books get this rating from me. It's intriguing and exciting and reminds me of the PC games I play (just one more page, just one more page). The reason I didn't give the fifth star are the characters. Those have some hidden agendas I fail to understand. I just cannot get through why they act and think in certain ways. Kids like Robb are successfully able to command armies and win while others, veterans like Ned make foolish mistakes. But I guess this just happens to everyone in real life, so I don't consider it so bad. The big minus is the deaths. *Don't get attached to any of characters. Anyone can die at any minute.* And of course that anyone is the coolest characters. I don't like the \\"die hard, always survive\\" type of characters we meet in most series like Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind. However, when those you set your highest hopes die, you hardly ever get time to get to like another one before s/he dies too.<br />I have always been such a sucker for magic but I think these books are a nice cool off from the overwhelming world of channeling of Jordan, let's say. So, if you like the might side of the fantasy genre or are tired of magic, this one is a must read.<br />On a general note the book seems balanced. It lacks the awful brutality of Goodkind (60 pages of massacre. 40 pages of torture. 3 pages of rape.) It also lacks the mawkishness of Tolkien (don't get me wrong, I love Tolkien but I find LotR too ... softcore ... with the elves and their songs). I still don't think it beats Raymond Feist and his saga, though.<br />To sum it up:<br />MUST READ IF YOU:<br />- enjoy intricate, deep and surprising plots<br />- are tired of magic series or just don't like books about magic<br />- enjoy battling scenes<br />- are interested and like the history of England and the War of the Roses<br />- play mostly barbarian heroes in games<br />- like \\"hardcore\\" type of fantasy books<br />- prefer characters in development who are not just good/bad<br />MUST *NOT* READ IF YOU:<br />- are such a sucker for magic and can't read a book without it<br />- would leave a book in its first 50-100 pages because you don't understand what it is about<br />- *get easily and deeply attached to characters*<br />- you get angry at characters who turn out to be \\"bad\\" when you think they are \\"good\\"<br />- are under 15-16.

B000067CPX|5.0|This is an amazing album.  For the people out there who listen to music because it's good, whether it's rap, classical, rock, or whatever, this is quality stuff.  It's ecclectic, and it's well done.  Unfortunately, because the Chili Peppers have been around so long, there's a portion of their original fanbase that never made it out of puberty.  They still expect 35-year-old musicians to come up with middle-school choruses.  These are the only people out there I can think of who would rate this album less than five stars.  Yeah, my first RHCP album was Freaky Styley too, but soon after that I went to high school, and then college, and eventually my musical tastes became a bit finer.  (I swear they're all still listening to The Dead Milkmen and Licensed to Ill) So for all you glue-sniffing gas-station attendents dogging By The Way because its lyrics present an unmatchable challenge in memorization, don't be bitter.  Personally, I don't know how you learned to use computers, but since you're here, on Amazon that is, listen to some new music.  Open your minds, and give the rest of us a break.  This is the best RHCP album, which I never thought I'd say after Californication, let alone Blood Sugar Sex Magic and Mother's Milk.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Anybody who says that this movie stinks are A) lying or B) dont like action.  This movie is really packed with good action sequences.  The opening one didn't really impress me (compared to the opening from Blade I), but Blade II maintained the action pretty well (bigger, badder ones than the first ones).  Although some of the CG action sequences are questionable, it didn't really mattter to me that much. <br />The addition of \\"reapers\\", ultra-super-uber vampires, are cool but aren't all that interesting once you get over how they \\"suck\\" the blood from victims.  Snipes delivers a good performace, maintaining the cool yet brutal title character he played in the first one.  The rest of the cast did well too, although the fling with Nyssa and the blood pack could have used more development.  <br />Yeah sure the plot is thin but why the heck would you worry about good plots when watching an action movie?  I mean sure it matters but I don't think it's vital to a movie that's in this case more comic-ishly action oriented.  If you want that, then go rent/buy the first one, which seems logical since all the people who complained about plot prefered Blade I.  Anyway good buy if you're a fan of good action movies.
0790729628|5.0|This film resonates with dark aura, with clever shafts of light peeking through--if you look closely enough. The light you will look for in the film represents both insight and the truth. You can watch scenes over and over again and it's remarkably fascinating. It can still compel you in the same way it did when you first watched it.<br />You can't put this film into a genre or perspective. And you can't call it futuristic. This is a very simple film that is clear in its message but haunting in its presentation, and ultimately it is a very lonely journey. It's not meant to be watched with anyone else, just alone, in my opinion. I would recommend turning on closed captioning too, as the voices are generally fairly soft and you could miss key dialogue. It's in widescreen format so the captioned words shouldn't get in the way.<br />I think everyone can relate to this film in one way or another. But no one can say what it's about. Loneliness, fear, hatred--these are all things we can relate to. But never has it been done in such an artistic way. I think this is one of those forms of art that has the ability to distract you from reality, maybe just long enough to learn something or at least be mesmerized for a short while.
0385503954|4.0|This is a good novel. Some UK reviewers have called it an epic and a masterpiece. It is neither. Although long for a McEwan novel, 351 pages does not an epic make. And McEwan's loyal readers (including this one) are still waiting for the masterpiece he will one day, no doubt, achieve. &quot;Atonement&quot; works on many levels: Here we have the annoying British class system, a stunning depiction of the BEF's retreat to Dunkirk and images of London during the Blitz. The stitching that holds it all together is betrayal and the quest for atonement thereafter. This novel should be read.

0553062182|5.0|I recommend this book to people who are sensitive and who also have Social Anxiety.  In getting over SA, it helped a great deal to know that there were traits that I had that were always going to be a part of me and that I could embrace and accept these traits instead of think that I must get rid of these traits to  be like everybody else.  It teaches you that your sensitive traits are OKAY.  You learn that sensitivity is not something to suppress and get rid of. You learn that sensitivity is not a weakness.  Actually, I see my trait now as a talent.  I trust my heightened awareness now and the information that it gives to me.  The author has taught me to view my trait as heightened awareness and thus not to attach a negative word description to it or negative view to it.  I give myself permission to take a break from noise etc. where others might not understand why it is needed sooner than they need a break.  I learned to not feel that I need to endure social contacts as long as others do.  This book taught me how to accept myself and understand why I am the way that I am.  This is one book that has had a great and powerful impact on my life.  If you are sensitive - you must own this book.
B000069CWE|5.0|that's right boys and girls...in my opinion, there has never been one good linkin park/hybrid theory song ever written, but when i heard pts. of athrty i was floored (the video was really cool too)....then i read into it and there are people like stephen carpenter from the deftones and jonathan davis from korn....even chali 2na from j5 and stephen richards from taproot are on there! i just had to check it out....and i'm glad i did. truly and honestly, this is one of those \\"must have\\" cd's of the year. as much as it pains me to say it...god, does it EVER! the only downer on the whole disk is the \\"whaah whaah whaah\\" of aaron lewis on krwlng...but that's the good thing about cd's, you can just push a button and the song goes away! now before you die hard LP fans go and start bashing me b/c i think your band [needs to improve], stop. i'm saying something good about them! well...the other people who took and remixed them anyway. never the less it's a great ... record!
0553212478|4.0|A story does not become as well-known and a part of the culture as this book has become without tapping in to some serious veins of the social subconscious. It is a fascinating idea, with a balance that allows for many hours of debate as to the relative merits of the monster and his creator, as well as the relative merits of the options facing Dr. Frankenstein, and whether the option he ultimately chose was the most ethical one or not. Still, much of the writing style itself is rather weak; there are places where it really shows that Shelley was only nineteen when she wrote it. Particularly given that the story is essentially told in the first person from the perspective of Dr. Frankenstein, in his voice, the fact that Shelley's dialogue is stilted and awkward is a real drawback. I realize that by the standards of 19th century fiction, the dialogue is not as poorly written as it would seem in a modern book, (dialogue was in general not a strong point in 19th century fiction) but even by those standards, the dialogue here is weak. Still, the concept is too good to rate less than four stars.

B000002JSV|5.0|Flat-out one of the best metal albums ever recorded.  True \\"Back In Black\\" is AC/DC's biggest commercial success, but it can't hold \\"bo-diddley squat\\" to the power in these grooves (what used to be grooves when I first purchased it anyway).  Great production with clear, crisp sound. Angus and Malcolm are in perfect sync with Bon Scott's best vocal performance (as well as lyrics).   This should be your first AC/DC purchase no questions asked.  Believe me, listen to this album and your copy of \\"Back In Black\\" will start gathering dust immediately.
B000002MZ6|5.0|In all my years of listening to music, I have found this CD to be the most spectacular of the Space Music and ambient classification.It is a CD you can listen to over and over and never tire of it.You can relax,sleep by, and play anytime and it's special beauty is clearly heard and over again.<BR>  If you like this CD ,You'll be pleased to know He has done other great CDS-Tubular Bells 3,The Millenium Bell,and Tubular Bells 2, and the NEW \\" TRES LUNAS \\" CD which recently became available .It is well worth owning all 4 of these CDs.<BR>  I can easily get tired of some CDS and listen to them only once or twice but this CD is one you'll always love to hear.<BR>When one buys a CD he has never heard, it's very, very rare he enjoys every track,every song- but you can LISTEN  to every song and enjoy EVERY song-A TOTALLY Beautiful CD without exception.<BR>  Ascension is my favorite track, a song that continually builds you up for a tremendous ascent into the heights of beautiful music! If I went into space,I'd have to take this CD with me to listen to whether I took anything else or not! :) You'll love it!! <BR>  Finally-This CD was the one that made me a Mike Oldfield fan many years ago.I think you'll say the same!
B0000035E7|5.0|Before the days of Nirvana's ruling over the world, they were just another struggling band, hoping to make it to the big time. This album is something you should definitely look out for, if you enjoy dark, heavy music, with ironic lyrics and a charmismatic frontman. Some of the songs take a while to fully get into, but you'll be pleased with their hits, 'About a Girl' and 'Love Buzz', as they are quite poppy and easy to listen to. 'Paper Cuts' makes for a gritty number, while 'Mr Moustache' is a defiant punk rock anthem about the rednecks Kurt Cobain had a loathing for.<br />The first ever Nirvana studio-released album, is one you should have in your CD collection!
B00005QIPH|1.0|you say about this band ... just remember that they have no lasting power. <br />That's it.  Waste your money if you want.
6302038308|5.0|This is a great horror movie! It has everything that a great horror movie series needs to become the ultimate horror trilogy! It has hilarious dark humor like when Ash's hand goes bad and hits him in the head with plates! Director Sam Raimi keeps the surprises coming with this one like when Ash looks at himself in the mirror and Evil Ash comes out! Sam Raimi as a director is very talented because, he can make a movie, write the script for it, and then mix all of these surprise key elements with it. When he started out doing the whole Evil Dead trilogy he started the first one out on a very low budget for I think maybe around Four-Thousand dollars. The second Evil Dead he had a higher budget. The third movie Army Of Darkness was a much higher budget than both the first and the second film combined. Look at Sam Raimi now! He directed Spider-Man which is not a low-budget film. This movie itself has an excellent plot! Ash is still trying to get away from the cabin but, the deadites won't let him. Then some people go their to find the proffesor so that they can give him the rest of the pages to the Book of the Dead and I am not going to tell you the rest so just go out and buy this movie! It isn't as gory as the first one but, it throws out buckets of blood!
B00006CXSS|5.0|An excellent movie with superb photography! A definite must see and must own movie. Each segment features interviews with the actual combatants portrayed in the movie. This is perhaps the best WWII movie ever filmed!
B000000OQF|5.0|For all of you out there that had the prescence of mind to buy this...you hold in your hands one of the most influential rock albums of all time.  You are to be commended.  This is one of the bands by which all other bands are measured.  On the other hand, for all you youngsters out there with  your silly Limp Bizkit/Blink 182/Slipknot pogo stick, masked, clown cd's out there, get down to the Best Buy and pick up the real deal.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce is one of only a few artists who could pull off a collection of songs inspired by 9/11 - and do it without draping himself in an American flag and shouting &quot;We're number one!&quot; (Bono is another who comes to mind- at least he put the American flag inside his jacket.)<br />What we have here, plain and simple, is a masterpiece. A soulful, soul-filled opus, which may very well be the defining work of Mr. Springsteen's career. On one level, it sounds great. Pop this baby in the car CD player, roll the top down and you're cruisin' - just like a real like rock album is supposed to do.<BR>From the opening riffs of Lonesome Day, to the Li Li Li's of The Rising, the hip-hop beat of The Fuse, and the exuberance of Mary's Place, Bruce and his E-Streeters have re-created the lexicon of American rock music, paying homage to familiar sounds, while keeping it identifiably E Street.<br />I want to hear Van Morrison sing My City in Ruins, and Smokey Robinson do Let's be Friends - these songs seem to be written for them. On the other hand, Mary's Place could have been found from the missing tapes of the Born to Run sessions. The gospel revival choir of My City in Ruins, the Middle Eastern chants of Worlds Apart, the twangs of Into the Fire, - all rich chocolate candy for the ears. I wonder how much of the credit for this goes to Brendan O'Brien - a wise choice, Bruce.<br />And the lyrics... Bruce has masterfully found the delicate balance between standing face to face with the deep, desperate, ultimate despair that's still hanging in the air, and hoping that things can, and will, get better. &quot;Things are bad,&quot; he is saying, &quot;as bad as they have ever been.&quot; And he puts it right out there for us...<br />&quot;Hell's brewin' dark sun's on the rise...&quot;<br />&quot;Sky falling, streaked with blood,&quot;<br />&quot;It's raining, but there ain't a cloud in the sky&quot;<br />&quot;Can't see nothin' in front of me, ... nothing coming up from behind...&quot;<br />&quot;Can hear the organ, but the congregation's gone&quot;<br />What Bruce also does here, is get to the poignant specificity of personal loss...<br />&quot;Coffee cups on the counter, jackets on the chair<BR>paper's on the doorstep, but you're not there&quot;<br />&quot;I heard you calling me,<BR>then you disappeared into the dust&quot;<br />&quot;Without you,<BR>I'm workin' with the rain falling down&quot;<br />Bruce is telling us it's OK to grieve, we have to grieve. He is helping wade through the darkness.<br />But there is hope. There is light. We will be alright...<br />&quot;I'm gonna find my way<BR>through this lonesome day&quot;<br />&quot;Meet me at Mary's Place,<BR>We're gonna have a party&quot;<br />&quot;Let's take the good times as they go<BR>and I'll meet you further on up the road&quot;<br />You can here him lifting us up on his back...<br />&quot;Come on up for the rising&quot;<br />&quot;Come on Rise up!<BR>Come on RISE UP!&quot;<br />In classic Bruce lyrical style, recurrent themes appear throughout the songs, a la Nebraska. Seems fascinating to me, though, that the song that sums it most up succinctly, My City in Ruins, is the one was written before the tragic<BR>events that inspired the rest of the album. Not sure what that means - a testament to the genius of Bruce?<br />Hardly - just evidence that the themes that Bruce writes about are universal and iconic: Love, Hate, Despair, Fear, Grief, and Hope. But in the end, with a little Rock and Roll to help along the way, it's gonna be alright.
0684843749|5.0|This is my 1st purchase on bodybuilding. and i must admit that its very interesting and practical. I started weight training about a month back using the programs from Kurt's &quot;Essential Chest and Shoulders&quot; series. This encyclopedia gave me accurate info on my training program and made me able to design my own weight training program within the shortest possible time. Its very inspiring and an excellent resource for all the fitness lovers. This book is COMPLETE CONFIDENCE but there is no replacement for your dedication and determination to achieve the physique that you wished for. Friends, the formula to success is: STRONG DETERMINATION + DECIPLINE + THIS GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA
B000069HKH|2.0|I love Springsteen, but this doesn't do it for me.  This is the E-Street Band?  Sounds like synthesizers and drum machines to me.  Where's the rawness?  Where's the heart?  I'm writing this as I listen to it for the first time.  I'm on track 8.  Will it really turn around and kick me in the keester for the second half?  I doubt it.  <br />I will review this again after I listen to the words, but the music doesn't do it.<br />Sorry, Bruce.
B000069HKH|4.0|Springsteen albums almost always require careful listening in order to gain the full understanding of the artist's message. This was true back in 1982 after the release of &quot;Nebraska&quot;. My appreciation for that album evolved as I grew older and more mature. It also made me appreciate other artists who have influenced Springsteen such as Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. With the release of &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;(a 5 star album)I came to realize that artistically speaking there's essentially two Springsteens:The rocker who performs great rock &amp; roll and the poet who writes in folkish working class style reminiscient of Woody Guthrie. He's had more success blending these two styles than any other artist with the possible exception of Bob Dylan.&quot;The Rising&quot; will most likely require the same attention and rethinking as &quot;Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Tom Joad&quot; especially with such courageous songs as &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;. Some may be disappointed with the album and slow to appreciate the message  but there's not another artist more deserving of a reexamination of his work 'further on up the road'.
B0000028M7|5.0|... Every track hides a deppresed feeling, but the more deppresing of them all is Hate To Feel. Don't get the wrong idea; this is a great album, played perfectly on every song. You should get this album even if you're a bitney spears fan.<br />There are songs that no matter what music you like; you'll like this ones... Like Down In A Hole, Would? and Rooster, the most known tracks from AIc..<br />Once you get past those songs, you should listen to the other gems, and listen Sickman, the biggest +point in the album, or Dam that River, or my personal favourite, RAIN WHEN I DIE....<br />Let's not say more: get this album...
B000053VAF|5.0|Kevin Smith has already established himself as a comedic genius, but he brings it to new heights with Dogma. While it may not have the apathy-charged wit of \\"Clerks,\\" the honesty and originality of \\"Chasing Amy,\\" or the silliness of \\"Mallrats\\" and \\"Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back,\\" it balances out all 3 of these elements perfectly. From the opening disclaimers to the closing credits, Dogma is a wildly satirical, irreverent, uproarious, and thought-provoking film.<br />The heavenly cast is led by Linda Fiorentino as Bethany Sloan, the cynical ex-Catholic. Overall, she could have done a bit better, but her casting is perfect and her performance was better than average. Next come Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who play the rejected angels Bartleby and Loki. Their constant bickering provides plenty of laughs, as well as some effectively serious moments. Smith regular Jason Lee is terrific as always, this time as the comically evil Azrael. Alan Rickman scores strongly as the delightfully sarcastic Medatron. Salma Hayek steals many of her scenes as the quirky muse. Chris Rock gives an attractive and thoughtful performance as the 13th apostle Rufus. And yes, Smith and Jason Mewes are back as those two lovable stoners Jay and Silent Bob, annoying yet ultimately endearing as always.<br />The plot revolves around the attempt of Bartleby and Loki to get back into heaven through a loophole created by the Catholic church. They must be stopped, or else they will prove that God is fallible, thus destroying existence.<br />BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!
B000002B2T|5.0|No weak tracks. No fill-up songs. This is heaven. This is perfection.<br />If you like, as I do, Layne's voice, and like to listen something different from him, look no more. <br />If I could rank every song of this album, everyone desserves an 100. Simple. The best tracks, my persounal faves, are Long Gone Day, Wake Up, X Ray Mind... But, those are my personal faves, coz I really love every track. <br />Lanegan provides Back up vocals on I'm Above and Long Gone Day, and I would like to say that he's the best vocalist alive (The Best of All time is Layne) in the 90 and 2000's.<br />WTF, get this album, and experience utterly perfection.
B00005QW5X|3.0|&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; defies description.  It is a rock musical about glamrocker Hedwig, who used to be Hansel, from East Germany.  Hedwig goes through a series of bizarre adventures and ends up a star with the band The Angry Inch.  Fun and dazzling visuals, but hard to follow and jumbled in places, the film tries to be art, heavy on symbols and irony, but doesn't quite succeed.  Worth a look, but could be better.
B000069HKH|4.0|It's difficult to knock Springsteen. In interviews and on television appearances he seems like a nice, down to earth guy. It's also difficult to look past the fact that &quot;The Rising&quot; is a new Springsteen album, his first with the E Street Band fully intact in 18 years. However, I am not willing to admit that this is Springsteen's finest hour. I am willing to admit that it's the best thing he's done since 1987's &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot;. The songs are a mixture of previous Springsteen ventures found on &quot;The Wild, The Innocent &amp; The E Street Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Born To Run&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, and &quot;Human Touch/Lucky Town&quot; albums. Springsteen sounds recharged on &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; the lead off track, and truly recaptures old glories on &quot;Mary's Place&quot;. There are more reflective numbers like &quot;Nothing Man&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot;, &quot;You're Missing&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot; and &quot;My City Of Ruins&quot;, but the feel of the album is more upbeat. I thought it was a nice change of pace to have Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn's son provide some Pakistani flavor to &quot;Worlds Apart&quot;, but Springsteen is no Paul Simon or Peter Gabriel (or even Robert Plant). I didn't think &quot;The Rising&quot; matched &quot;Darkness On The Edge Of Town&quot;, &quot;Nebraska&quot; or &quot;Born In The U.S.A.&quot;, but it is superior to &quot;Human Touch/Lucky Town&quot; and &quot;The Ghost Of Tom Joad&quot;. Fans will eat this up, but for non-fans I'd suggest starting elsewhere in the Springsteen catalog.
6304795254|5.0|This \\"sleeper\\" is my favorite movie. (My second favorite is \\"Fast Times @ Ridgemont High\\", so diversity is key here.)  I finally own the DVD so I can watch it at least twice a year, which is just about right to get caught up in it again. They really should re-release it at the theaters so people would know that it exists. So many missed it the first time around, myself included. I just wish someone would bring us a movie that is even \\"close\\" to these two so I could rotate my collection more often. Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, everyone is  great in this flick.
B000066I6N|4.0|After watching Robert Plant on Storytellers I went out and bought the album.  I was a Zeppelin fan but never really a ROBERT PLANT solo fan.  I was disapointed in the PAGE/PLANT studio album, but I think it had more to do with the way it was produced.  This album makes up for it.  I have listened to this album over and over and I can't get tired of it.  Good job Robert!!!

B000002J1U|2.0|Led Zeppelin seemed to be going through a period of quiet hippie instrospection on this disc - most of it is ultra-boring acoustic songs you can't mosh to.  Nonetheless, there are a few highlights; they include:<br />-The rousing \\"Immigrant Song,\\" a rocking tune indeed.  After this song, though, the hippie tunes come out in full force. <br />-The gentle intro to \\"Gallow's Pole,\\" which unfortunately turns into a barnyard stomp best heard on the show \\"Hee-Haw\\" in the 80's.<br />-The tender \\"Tangerine\\" song.  Robert Plant sure gets a lot of mileage out of a piece of fruit!<br />-\\"Hats off to Roy Harper\\" is a psychadelic jam!  They should have included more psychadelia into the mixes of these songs.  As the Led III songs currently stand, they're about as dull as Jimmy Page's collaboration albums in the 80's - without the solo electric guitar!!  <br />My hope is that an exciting re-mix Led Zeppelin III album comes out soon, like Lincoln Park recently did with their hit album!!  They could add phat, Bizkit-type beats, and some rap overdubs to offset Plant's pathetic whining.  In my opinion, this is the only solution to remedy the sorry state of this dull record...
B000069HK2|5.0|I am a big fan of the genre they call pop punk, with my favorite band being MxPx. But once I was infected with the likes of the Used, Finch and Glassjaw, I just could not stop listening! This CD not only has great tunes and awesome screaming, but its extremely powerful. Not one song is bad, and not one song is mediocre! Every song is awesome! Heres how I rate them, with 10 being the best, and 1 the worst(even though none of the songs come close to a 1).<br />1.Maybe Memories - A great opener with a Deftone vibe. I have heard this song is about the lead singer Bert McCracken's dark, drug filled past. 9/10<br />2.The Taste of Ink - Another great song, great lyrics and great tune. Not as much screaming and power as track one, but it has an infectious tune and vibe, with an awesome chorus. 10/10<br />3.Bulimic - A great song once again, what more can I say? The phrase \\"a great song\\" is becoming a cliche now. The chorus is great on this song...as a matter of fact everything is great. Once again the lyrics send a message. 9/10<br />4.Say Days Ago - Awesome song, but not as good as the others. Its got a great heavy opening vibe to it and a scream-along prechorus. 9/10<br />5.Poetic Tragedy - Powerful song with amazing lyrics. A lot softer than the other tracks on the CD, but its probably one of the best songs. The songs about a poet/singer whose career becomes tragedy due to substance abuse. Very powerful. 10/10<br />6.Buried Myself Alive - When I first heard this song, I was left speechless!!! The best song on the CD, undoubtedly! It is a very powerful song, mixed with awesome lyrics, and a very very good chorus! Completely amazing! 15/10 hehe<br />7.A Box Full of Sharp Objects - The first single of the CD, and a very good choice. It represents the band's metal vibes and exemplifies a good amount of Bert's screaming. The video is also included on this CD in the enhanced part of it, so be sure to watch that also. 10/10<br />8.Blue and Yellow - A great song, with a lot lesspower and lyrics than the other songs, but its still got that awesome vibe and power that makes it an awesome song. 8/10<br />9.Greener with the Scenery - Amazing song, great lyrics to relate to if youve ever had a girl who plays games with your heart. I love the chorus. 10/10<br />10. Noises and Kisses - Not as good as the rest of the CD, but still a great CD. Its a good song to listen to and isn't worth skipping. Another great song with a great chorus from these guys. 8/10<br />11.On My Own - An amazingly powerful song with a very heavy and moving orchestral background. The mix of the acoustic guitar with this sort of saddening orchestral melody makes this song a must-listen! 2nd best song on the CD. 10/10<br />12.Pieces Mended - A very heavy, and great way to close out the CD.... 9/10<BR> ....but wait, theres more! <br />Hidden Track: Choke Me - I love listening to this song! Its such a good song to listen to when you are (mad). Lotsa screaming and lots of power and amazing guitar part! It comes about 7 minutes into the final track (#12). It starts out with you listening to Bert get a surprise birthday gift from the rest of the guys, when they ordered the fattest stripper in London to come over and...yeh...you get it. 10/10<br />All in all, this CD is absolutely amazing! John Feldmann, the lead singer of the also amazing band Goldfinger, produced this CD and did a great job. I cannot wait to see the Used at the Warped Tour this summer! They are gonna rock!! Later folks.
B000002C1V|5.0|Simply put, Pink Floyd have never sounded better as a band, and the staggering teamwork that went in to making this masterpiece defies belief. Unlike most huge rock bands that can't ever seem to get along in the studio, the four crackerjacks in Pink Floyd were able to work through their slight differences and lay down some of the most heavy tracks of their career, on this \\"The Final Cut.\\" There's even a \\"mad\\" rumor that old Syd rejoined the band on guitar for one of the more pop tracks on this record. Some say he didn't. Either way, you can't argue with results! <br />No one knows about the horrors of war better than multi-millionaire Roger Waters, whose reflective take on the subject always stirs up a little controversy - and makes everybody appropriately sad. <br />Well, I won't ramble on about what a genius Waters is. I'm glad Pink Floyd collectively decided, as a free-thinking unit, to keep Gilmour's input to a minimum on this record. His tuneful guitar licks and baritone voice just get in the way of Roger Waters' greatness!...
630587493X|4.0|I put off watching this for a while because of the negative views this film had and becaus it was made for children, or that is what I thought.<br />I watched it last night, and I was thrown deep into the movie. This is a very interesting journey of a robot that wants and do become human. As prevoious reviewers said, the movie is a bit week in the first portion, but once you overcome this you are in for a treat.<br />The movie portrays the Isaac Asimov feeling. I did not know that this is what it was based on, but I am a fan of the late Mr. Asimov'c writings. I found that the undercurrents and the emotions were superbly portrayed by Robin Williams. I got some more feeling towards Asimov's writing from this movie. Well worth the watch.<br />Once last note, is that the movie is not Oscar material. &quot;A.I.&quot; was a much better movie, but this movie is much better than most of the offerings out there.<br />This is a serious movie. It contains wonderfule character development, romance, humour, and will provoke the mind to think. Taking as such, it will be a wonderful experience.
0784011176|5.0|Jane Campion's \\"The Piano\\" does what many truly great films do:  It inspires fascinating discussion and provokes mixed reactions.  The male friend with whom I saw it back in 1993 and I were so enthralled that we kept our significant others waiting to leave for our respective Christmas vacations because we kept phoning each other to discuss symbolism and interesting themes in the movie.  While I continue to absolutely love the film, I also recognize why some viewers have not shared my reaction.  Perhaps you have to have at least considered a forbidden love affair or perhaps you have to have found yourself trapped in a relationship where you feel you have lost your voice to appreciate what Campion explores.<br />The story centers around Ada (Holly Hunter in an Oscar-winning performance) and her daughter, Flora (Anna Paquin--who also won an Oscar for her extraordinary performance).  They leave their upper-class home in Scotland after Ada's father (apparently) arranges her marriage.  Ada, who has willed herself not to speak since age 6, expresses herself through her beloved piano.<br />The true story of who fathered Flora is never revealed in the movie, but the context suggests that she is Ada's illegimate child born from an illicit affair.  The hinted-at story of Flora's conception provides a key to understanding both why Ada later begins an affair with her New Zealand neighbor Baines (Harvey Keitel) and why she makes a mail-order marriage in the first place.  I suspect that Ada's aging father may have wanted to see her settled--preferably far away so that her unconventional behavior would no longer be a source of social embarassment--and given Ada's muteness and out-of-wedlock child, her father probably couldn't find a suitable suitor in mid-Victorian Scotland.<br />Stewart (Sam Neill) first encounters his future wife on a lonesome gray beach surrounded by her crated belongings.  His Maori porters begin carrying many household items up the muddy path to his dreary homestead.  But Stewart refuses to bring the piano along, despite Ada's apparent distress and Flora's pleas that her mother MUST have her piano.<br />Ada's piano, abandoned on the barren New Zealand beach, captures the sense of what 19th century colonial life might have been like for too many women--treasured possessions, the last ties to \\"civilization\\" left behind.<br />Rendered voiceless without her piano, Ada begs Stewart to return for her instrument through notes and more pleas from Flora.  Finally she persuades Baines--a colonist whose tattoed face evidences the extent to which he has \\"gone native\\" and who is considered less civilized by his neighbors--to guide her back to the beach.  Ada comes to life again as she, at last, gets to play.  Drawn by her passion for the piano, Baines arranges with Stewart to trade land for the piano.  Without consulting his wife, Stewart assures him that Ada will provide lessons too.<br />During first of these lessons, Ada strikes her own bargain with Baines, whom she still considers a boor:  She will trade sexual favors to earn back her piano, one key at a time.  Ultimately, her reluctant bargain grows into full-blown love and passion.  The dark, brooding tone of \\"The Piano,\\" however, suggests that something in this situation will go tragically, and probably violently, wrong.<br />Campion has filled her movie with haunting piano music (actually played by Hunter) and intriguing imagery.  The metaphor of piano as voice and losing and regaining one's voice, Flora's role in changing her mother's fate, the question of whether Ada's bargain reflects a woman taking control of her life or just being victimized in a different way, and many other complexities make this a movie worth watching again and again and again.
0393317552|5.0|...<br />While Diamond does state that cultural biases affect the adoption of technologies, and that technologically advanced cultures conquer, destroy or out-breed less advanced, he does not draw the logical conclusion or illustrate and inform the reader as to the logical outcome of his studies: that while technology has followed the path of least geographical resistance, and that the distribution of plants and animals has greatly affected the cultural evolution of different peoples, the density of human populations, and the speed of transportation has eliminated the geographic resistances of the past, and that cultures who do not adopt technologies, including the conceptual technologies of medicine, rule of law, individual freedom and market capitalism will be dominated by those that do. And that if the leadership of any nation, truly loves and desires the best for it's people, it must adopt these more competitive technologies as fast as possible, so that their people can produce and consume \\"cargo\\", rather than be the victims of others who produce more.<br />This book is yet another missed opportunity for a reasoned scholar to use empirical information to illustrate how those culturally backward societies that still dominate our planet can advance the quality of human life, and instead, by the accidentally malicious act of politically sanitizing his work, provides solace to those who would perpetuate the ignorance, mysticism, primitivism and fear of the pre-rational, dark age cultures struggling against a tide of commerce, prosperity and rationalism.<br />While it is true that the present-day members of any culture are not responsible for their current status, they are indeed responsible for actions that intend to maintain that status, their culture, and their beliefs. Diamond rewards us with the detail and accuracy of his analysis, but errs by not drawing the conclusions that would help peoples of the world actually benefit from his work.<br />Hopefully, Mr. Diamond will provide a ten-year anniversary edition that fixes this mistake.<br />For these reasons, the book should indeed receive a lower rating by reviewers. However, if a reader keeps this weakness of Diamond's in mind, then the book provides an interesting study in human technological evolution, with a wealth of data, and conveyed through both excellent voice and compelling storytelling.

B00004SU5J|5.0|The first time I heard this CD was in a small cafe in Paris.  After I found out what the CD title was from the waiter (I was actually shocked to learn it was a French musician) we headed to the Virgin Record store on the Champs-Elysees to buy it.<br />If you enjoy Trip Hop and Acid Jazz and everything in between this is the album for you.  Every time I hear this album I am taken back to that cafe.  It is still one of my all time favorite albums.
B000002N3J|4.0|This album isn`t Madoona`s best, but it`s still good. When you listen to it over and over it gets a little boring because all the songs are ballads. Maybe if there would be a few fast tracks on this album I would rate this album higher. My favourites are Take A Bow and Rain, but there are many other good songs besides them. I think that if you are really fan of Madoona you should own it.
0767817478|1.0|....zzzzzzzzzzzz...Huh?  What?  The movie?  Oh yeah.  There was a movie going on, wasn't there?  Wow.  Um.  Yeah.<br />I'd love to tell you more about the movie, but I can't, 'cause I fell asleep.  That says a lot for me, because I have seen plenty of horrible movies.  But, I have had the strength to either finish them to the end or just turn it off.  This, I couldn't turn off.  Because I was sleeping.  I thought that maybe it was because I was tired, so I wanted to give it a second chance.  Well......I think I stayed awake a minute or two longer than the first viewing.<br />So, since this movie put me to sleep, I think it's safe to say that I think this movie is trash.  Horrible.  I even saw bits and bits on HBO and still didn't want to wactch it all the way through.<br />Now, I usually love Mathew Broderick.  I think he's a terrific actor.  But in this film.......oh boy.<br />I will give credit where credit is due.  From what I was able to see, the special effects were very neat and cool.  But that still didn't save the movie.<br />So, I hated this film.  Then again, I was never a big fan of the old Godzilla movies.  Still, if a movie was able to put me to sleep, then it's pretty bad.  Escpecially when I gave it two chances.<br />Then again, that's only my opinion.  It all comes down to taste, and as always with the case: people will either like the movie or hate the movie.  I belong in the second category.
B0000640S1|5.0|Out of the three Rambo movies I have seen. I enjoyed this film the most.  Sly Stone plays John Rambo ex-Vietnam Veteran, Green Beret, medal of honor winner who returns from the war looking for an ex army buddy in small town U.S.A. only to find that his friend has died of cancer from chemical weapons that were used over seas. As Rambo walks through this small town the local sheriff agitates him to a point of aggression, even though Rambo warns him to \\"Let it go or I will give you a war you won't believe\\". The viewer has to realize that in some places in America drifters and outsiders are feared and the local law enforcement officers don't take kindly to strangers. After being harassed at the police station Rambo has a wartime flash back and reverts back to his special forces training and rains havoc on an inexperience National Guard and State and County Police units. The Army calls in Rambo's old commander Col. Chapmen who finally gets Rambo to calm down and to realize that he is fighting against the country he loves and that he volunteered to defend. Great movie. Good story line and realistic action. Thumbs up!
6305508550|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies.  Why?  Because it's not one of those movies that only relies on tired and crude offensive sex jokes and gross out humor.  (And yes, those are fine as well.  You'll notice that I didn't really have a problem with \\"Freddy got Fingered.\\"  It just gets overplayed too much.)  The movie is actually ingenious with a great story, plot, and a terrific cast of characters.<br />Peter Gibbons is living through Hell twenty-four-seven.  He works for a corporation that has eight bosses barking orders at him everyday.  It seems like it just gets worse everyday.  Well, that all changes when his eyes are open and his mind is at ease.  He realizes that the answer to his solution is to not care anymore.  And that's exactly what he does.<br />I loved everything about this movie.  All of the characters are unique in each way.  But I must say, Milton steals the show.  The mumbling man is played by the very hillarious Stephen Root.  He really is the show-stopper.  Keep a close eye on him.<br />This movie is so realistic, it hurts.  Especially if you work at that kind of an environment.  Come on, how many times have you been stuck in traffic and it seems like everyone is moving except for the people in your lane?  This movie takes all of the elements that take place at a work place and magnifies it a hundred times over.  It's so funny....it's painful to watch at times.<br />The DVD could've been better.  No eye-popping special features.  It's a shame, since this is such a great movie, and is loved by a lot of people.  Still, it's the CONTENT that counts.  The picture and sound quality was really good.<br />\\"Office Space\\" is a hillarious laugh-riot that will hook you from the start.  Check it out as soon as you can.  In a world filled with terrible comedies, it's refreshing to know that good ones still exist and are still being made.  See this movie!  Chances are you will love it.
B00005AREQ|5.0|This album is a classic instrumental album, and he <BR>seems to go from jazz fusion to rock to blues and back<BR>again in one album. <BR>  If there is a problem with this album, it is that it<BR>might not be appreciated by the masses because it's not<BR>really a commercial album in terms of the music.<BR>  This would be a great CD to pick up if you're into<BR>appreciating fine music that crosses and mixes several<BR>different genres into one album. It appeals to the <BR>intellectual in us, and makes one think.<BR>  An album that would be appreciated by those with <BR>more refined or more mature tastes in music. If you<BR>like jazz and/or blues music, this disc might be <BR>worth checking out.<BR>  This album makes you think about what Beck is trying<BR>to convey or say, because in certain tracks he changes<BR>the speed and tone of the track. I can't really classify<BR>this album in one particular genre, because if you listen<BR>to this CD, it appears he's influenced by several on this<BR>album.  <BR>   This was the first Jeff Beck album I purchased, and it<BR>is considered his finest by some. This album might serve<BR>as a preview for The Best Of Jeff Beck and Beckology, if<BR>some of you, like I am, are considering purchasing either<BR>title or both titles down the road.<BR>   In my opinion, this is the CD you listen to after a<BR>long day and you've had your dinner to appreciate it.<BR>I don't think this is the kind of CD you would necessarily<BR>appreciate as much if you were cruising around town, or<BR>going on the highway for a nice weekend drive.
B00005JKEC|1.0|I feel that this is not up to the quality work I've seen from Denzel in the past.
B00001ZULV|4.0|If you're a fan of the early prog-rock Peter Gabriel-led<BR>Genesis, and don't like the Phil Collins-led pop singles<BR>&amp; hit albums version of the band, then my advice to you<BR>is avoid this collection. However, if you do like Phil<BR>Collins' Genesis, this is a good addition to your <BR>collection.<BR>  Genesis changed radically in terms of musical direction<BR>when Gabriel left the band and Collins took over as the<BR>frontman for the group. The popularity of Genesis soared<BR>dramatically, but at the price of essentially changing <BR>their music. While it paid off handsome dividends for<BR>the band from a financial standpoint, one has to wonder<BR>if the band did it to appease their mass commercial<BR>market, or their record company. <BR>  Turn It On Again is probably a good introduction<BR>to the Phil Collins-led version of the band. This is<BR>a catchy upbeat pop tune that even I have to admit <BR>isn't that bad of a song. Invisible Touch was the<BR>title song from arguably Genesis' most successful<BR>album to date, at least commercially. Invisible <BR>Touch is another pop tune, and I believe it was <BR>the first song by Genesis to reach number 1. The<BR>whole album did extremely well for the band and<BR>really elevated the band from a solid band to<BR>international superstars. Mama is probably my<BR>favorite Genesis song on this album. The haunting,<BR>somewhat chilling music on this track, plus <BR>Phil Collins' devious laugh (ha ha ha ...oh!),<BR>which was the hook, makes this a classic. If I<BR>remember correctly, the song is about prostitution.<BR>  What I liked about this song is it marked a <BR>departure from the predictable Genesis pop tunes<BR>I had been hearing up to that time from Phil<BR>Collins' led Genesis.<BR>  Most of this album is pop and soft rock, so if<BR>you're a fan of the early Genesis buy Foxtrot,<BR>Selling England By The Pound, Nursery Cryme,<BR>and The Lambs Lie Down on Broadway. These albums I<BR>have heard are very good, greator even essential <BR>and hope to acquire them eventually.<BR>   I kind of wished Phil incorporated more of his<BR>jazz roots into his version of Genesis and focused<BR>less on the electro-pop, but then again the 1980s<BR>rock music scene was heavily influenced by <BR>synthesizers and keyboards.<BR>  If you like early Genesis, you may also probably<BR>like Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Pink Floyd, King<BR>Crimson, Yes (pre 90125), Jethro Tull, and other <BR>similar related progressive rock bands.<BR>  If you like Phil Collins' Genesis, then may I<BR>recommend Styx, Chicago, Journey, REO Speedwagon,<BR>Air Supply, The Bee Gees, Foreigner and Boston.<BR>  I didn't buy any Genesis albums after Collins<BR>left the band, so my impression of the last<BR>Genesis frontman is still somewhat uncertain. My<BR>final note is it's too bad this band had to break<BR>up, considering their importance in music history,<BR>and the things they did, but c'est la vie.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Take one of the great human voices (Tweedy) and bury it in the mix, slather digital effects and artsy EQ all over it.  Take one of the great songwriters of the last ten years &amp; let him write lyrics that are strings of nonsensical &quot;associations&quot;.  Take a great band &amp; break it apart.  Fire it's soul.  You get this self indulgent, largely unlistenable album.  Hey, I love this band &amp; I'll stick with them through almost anything, but this finds them seeking a cool factor... critical acclaim going to their heads.  <BR>I love it when bands take chances, try new directions, and I give them credit for that, but this album is just not very good.  I want to hear Jeff sing, I want to hear harmonies, I want to hear great musicianship and brilliant lyrics.  The noise is interesting &amp; cool, but without the rest it will just sit on the shelf instead of in the CD player.<BR>Nothing lasts forever...
B000002ULO|5.0|Thank's for a great cd. Paul McCartney's Flaming Pie <BR>is a cd that sounds like the old Paul I'm use to. I hope <BR>he will continue to write more song's like this. I recommend it to any one who loved the Beatles music, and Paul McCartney.<BR>The cd came perfectly shipped as seller promised, and very <BR>quick in sending.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is an excellent album.  Plain and simple.   This album is full of raw emotion, a sense of depth beyond understanding and a drive that will keep you rocking.  Songs like Radio Friendly Unit Shifter make this album.  It definently left a good impact on me, being one of Nirvana's best.  I think Kurt's legacy lives on through this CD the best -- it's full of everything a good Grunge CD needs, and it is easily Nirvana's best.<br />If you're new to Nirvana, buy Nevermind, it will get you liking them and not throw you off right away.  Then try In Utero, if you like it, Nirvana's for you.<br />Bottom Line: VERY ape.  :)

B000002N2P|5.0|Just when I was finally getting tired of Dookie, after several years, I bought this CD and got a renewed appreciation for this awesome band.  I don't know why it didn't do as well in the sales and publicity, because it is really good.
B0000640VN|3.0|I really, really wanted to love this movie.  At first sight it had everything I wanted in a movie....Hugh Jackman, chivalry, time travel, love conquers all theme(yada, yada, yada).  I've liked a few Meg Ryan films before and I certainly was prepared to be open-minded about this film.<br />It started out fairly promising.  Hugh Jackman looked marvelous as a turn-of-the-century nobleman.  I fell in love with him right away.  The supporting cast led by Liev Shrieber (as Kate's ex-boyfriend) and Breckin Meyer (Kate's brother Charlie) was entertaining and even funny.  It was Meg Ryan (Kate) that I really had a problem with.  From the first frame til the very last second, she really felt wrong as Kate.  There's no sweetness or endearing quality about this character that would make me empathize with her or want to be like her.  Meg Ryan as Kate was stiff and dull - it was as if she (Meg) was going through the motions just for the heck of it.  You get that feeling of: &quot;heck, here's another romantic comedy for me to act in. Blah, blah, blah.&quot;  At times I even felt like smacking her. You'd think an actress who got paid millions could at least put a little more effort into her work than the usually drivel.<br />This film in the hands of another lead actress would've made it much more interesting and enjoyable (Gwyneth Paltrow or Cameron Diaz perhaps?).  Thank goodness for Hugh Jackman or the 2 hours I spent watching this could've really been unbearable!  If you want an effective romantic comedy, check out &quot;Serendipity,&quot; &quot;4 Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; &quot;Nottinghill,&quot; &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; or any of the Jane Austen-based films (&quot;Emma,&quot; &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;) instead.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce Springsteen manages to distill all of the emotions and questions that you go through, at all points in your life, into a living, breathing organism of music. He just makes that connection with you, be it live or on record, which makes you sit up and say, &quot;yes, this is me, this is where I am, this is what I'm about... hell someone out there understands that!&quot;<br />As rock critic Tom Gillingwater said above, this is what makes Bruce a great artist.  Most of his songs have carried a message of hope even in the midst of despair.  It is no wonder that 9/11 moved him to produce such a piece of work.  <br />I was at the opening night for this concert wondering how Bruce would perform the solemn songs in such a festive atmosphere.  His sequence of songs was amazing.  The solemn &quot;Empty Sky&quot; followed by &quot;You're Missing&quot; to the hopeful &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; was remarkable.   Bruce did a great job mixing the setlist so that songs of despair were followed logically by songs of hope.  <br />It was also interesting to see how Bruce took many of the more &quot;techno&quot; sounds (for lack of a better term), and performed them live.  The addition of Soozie Tyrell on violin adds a warming touch to the E-street band's live performance.<br />Don't just listen to this album and expect to hear the &quot;old&quot; E-Street Band.  Listen to this album and put yourself in the position of the poor wife / mother who left her husband's Ford Explorer at the Middletown NJ train station (near my house) in the hope that her husband was simply among the missing.  That long ride to the train station to pick up the car eventually happened as the man was among those lost in the tragedy.  Think about this situation, and listen to the song &quot;You're Missing.&quot;  It should bring a tear to your eye.
B000066744|5.0|Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).  <br />The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him \\"1900\\".  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.<br />The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room.  All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.<br />Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.<br />Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz.  Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.<br />The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years with five Oscar nominations.  He has scored over 400 films including &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Disclosure&quot;, and &quot;Twister&quot;.  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding. <br />For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a richly rewarding experience.
0375707972|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" is a book to savor.  Expertly written, this book pulls you in with moments of bliss and wonder as our protagonist's quiet life suddenly explodes with passion and yearning.  The novel then shifts from the physical to the philosophical, as Michael encounters the uncertainties behind the ecstasy. We hear all this from the perspective of a grown man, carefully considering a lifetime of choices.<br />As he unravels and examines his life, Michael confronts questions that are universal in scope. In relationships, in life, we are all faced with choices and our choices have consequences.  Wrestling with one's own choices is necessarily a lifetime endeavor, but in \\"The Reader\\" it is evident how choices we made long ago can stay with us.  <br />We also find ourselves in situations that require us to judge the choices of others.  This moral dilemna, constructing a reliable platform within our own ambiguous morality from which we can evaluate others, is wonderfully explored in this book.  <br />I found Michael's voice and character to be quite likeable and sympathetic; in his unassuming way, he is sweet and charming.  Fate pairs him up with Hanna, a mysterious older woman, and he tumbles into love.<br />Years later, still uneasy about questions of his own guilt in betraying Hanna, Michael unexpectedly finds himself in a courtroom where Hanna's larger actions as an SS guard are being judged. <br />As her former lover, Michael is in an unusal position.  Michael struggles to match the Hanna who called him \\"Kid\\" with the camp guard guilty of such unpardonable crimes.  The time he spent reading to Hanna provides the prism through which he views her now.  Remembering how this time they shared was a warm and intimate part of their trysts, and hearing that Hanna selected certain prisoners to read to her within the walls of the camp, Michael chooses to believe that his former lover's actions were not unkind.  <br />In a stark and dramatic scene, Michael encounters an older man who suggests that it was possible to kill the Jews because the Germans involved were indifferent.  Michael is appalled by this idea, and despite her guilty verdict Michael can't be indifferent to Hanna.  His care and concern for her continue throughout his life; he resumes the role of her reader. <br />We never know exactly what Hanna is thinking, but her final actions are arresting. Inspired by Michael's recorded books, enough to become a reader herself, she nonetheless loses faith in herself when Michael fails to address her in his own words.  Michael realizes only too late that Hanna felt the sting of his inability to forgive her.   <br />All in all, a very thoughtful and complicated novel wrapped in a concise and rewarding package.  Setting \\"The Reader\\" against the Holocaust may be upsetting to some people, but it does indeed serve as a larger mirror against which our protagonist can measure his own worth.
0380729407|5.0|\\"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\\" This quote from Shakespeare adequately describes this now-classic work of horror by Ray Bradbury. Bradbury manages to use evocative language and charming characters to draw the readers into what is almost a parallel world.<br />Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade are boys born two seconds apart -- one on Halloween, the other on the day before. Will is the ultimate innocent, while Jim is darker and more knowledgeable about the world. These two have been inseparable friends all their lives, despite their different personalities and tiny events that divide them on subtle levels. Then, one day, a strange carnival comes to their town, with a freak show and a carousel.<br />But a more sinister undercurrent runs in this carnival: The freak show, with its tattooed \\"illustrated man,\\" blind gypsy witch, and murderous dwarf, is more menacing than the townspeople expect. And when Will and Jim see the carousel change a man's age, they become the targets of Mr. Dark and his evil cohorts -- for fates worse than death.<br />Bradbury's writing is a mixed bag. While it's extremely evocative and often surreal, it becomes a little clumsy at times. He refers to the carousel horses having \\"panic-colored teeth,\\" but never explains what this description means. His metaphors occasionally become very strained, and at times the lapses into philosophical musings become distractions to the overall plotline.<br />However, he expertly draws out a feeling of horror with only a few words, never overdoing the descriptions of something that terrifies Jim and Will. Rather than using \\"ghoulies and ghosties,\\" Bradbury plays on fears in every human being, such as fears of aging, loneliness, physical decrepitude, loss of loved ones, and most horrifyingly when people are aged or de-aged and thus unrecognizable to their friends and loved ones. The buildup of suspense as the boys hide from Dark and his lackeys is utterly terrifying. And in a masterful use of nostalgia, Bradbury brings readers to the midwestern America of his youth, an innocent place of screen doors, fall leaves and barber shops.<br />Jim and Will are good foils for one another. Too often in books with two lead characters of the same age and background, there is no personality difference, but these boys are radically different. Will is an utter innocent, with no comprehension of the seductiveness of evil and a great deal of fear for his family and his best friend. Jim, on the other hand, is more susceptible to Mr. Dark's offers. He wants to age to the level of a young adult with the carousel, while knowing in his heart that nothing good can come of it; his temptation is frightening in its intensity. The temptation is reversed for the quiet Charles Holloway, who is haunted by his own age and the relative youth of his son. His gradual changes of thought on this matter are never clumsy or sappy, but rather with the brilliance of Charles' new perceptions.<br />\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is one of the rare stories that blends unusual prose, good characterizations, and skilful atmosphere into a true spinechiller. A great horror classic. Do not read after dark.erful use of nostalgia, Bradbury brings readers to the midwestern America of his youth, an innocent place of screen doors, fall leaves and barber shops. <br />Jim and Will are good foils for one another.

B0000683DH|5.0|I took the prior release to task  for what I felt was a sub-par transfer (many review sites would have disagreed.  But  I saw this movie when it first came out and the first DVD transfer made it look like an old movie on the late show).  However, the colors and sharpness  on the new two-disc version are noticeably better.  (The opening Kobyashi Maru sequence is a good example, if you have the prior DVD.)<br />Above all it's  a lot of fun.  Ricardo Montalban reprises his role of 20th century despot Khan who the Enterprise crew  first encountered during the original series (&quot;Space Seed&quot;)  Director Nicolas  Meyer brought a much-needed  freshness to the  game after the somewhat  blah Robert Wise  film.   Meyer had previously directed the charming thriller &quot;Time after Time,&quot; which also came out on DVD on Aug. 6, 2002.   So buy or rent this film and thrill to the days when movies weren't made by clueless  studio marketing hacks, but by talented auteurs.
B0000024TT|5.0|I can't believe I lived 26 years without knowing about Leonard Cohen.  I have always been a fan of Paul Simon and considered him unequalled as far as singers/songwriters go.  But I have to admit that I find Cohen equally brilliant and enjoyable to listen to.<br />Cohen's music really creeps up on you.  At first it sounds almost ordinary but eventually permeates your soul.  Like the teaching of Jesus, much of Cohen's meaning are hidden but merit deeper perusal.  This has to be my favorite of his albums.  &quot;Suzanne&quot; and &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; are absolutely timeless songs of love, faith, loneliness and spirituality.  I cannot recommend this CD strongly enough.
B000002P5W|5.0|In only a few short months after the landmark Are You Experienced? was released, Jimi and his Experience created another musical triumph in the form of Axis: Bold as Love. While AYE was a solid but somewhat rough sounding collection of mostly road tested tunes like \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Fire\\", ABaL was an absolute marvel of studio-born songs with sound quality that amazes to this day.  If you had no knowledge of Hendrix and found yourself listening to Axis, you'd think it was recorded last week instead of 1968.<br />A quick song review:<br />1. EXP - Drummer extraordinaire Mitch Mitchell plays a radio announcer who interviews a \\"very peculiar looking gentleman who goes by the name of Mr. Paul Carusoe.\\"<br />2. Up From the Skies - A wah-wah drenched jazzy number that displays Hendrix's affinity for science fiction.  Check out Mitchell's drumming.<br />3. Spanish Castle Magic - This song really doesn't need an introduction.  Everybody from the Spin Doctors to Yngwie Malmsteen covered it.<br />4. Wait until Tomorrow - A funny little number about Jimi trying to run off with his sweetheart only to be told by her to \\"wait until tomorrow\\"; except for when her father shoots him.<br />5.  Ain't no Telling - The most rocking song on Axis.  It isn't even two minutes long and it has more twists than the hourly production at a pretzel factory.<br />6.  Little Wing - The classic ballad with one of the most recognizable intros ever.  You should also hear Stevie Ray Vaughan's version as well.<br />7.  If 6 Was 9 - Hendrix's ode to being yourself even if the rest of the world changes.  One of Hendrix's heaviest songs.<br />8.

B0000019PA|5.0|I have played this album for countless friends, and (almost) all of them have immediately asked who it was and where could they get the album.<br />It's THAT GOOD! <br />Every song had incredible intensity, both musically and emotionally, mainly due to Jeff Magnum's aching and pleading voice and the amazing lyrics that don't always seem to make sense. Oh, and the music is really catchy too. You'll find yourself humming them at random points during the day. (Or is that just me?)<br />There isn't a bad song on the album, and I never skip a song. The first song that got me hooked was the title song, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, but now, I can't even begin to pick a favorite. Even the ones I didn't care for at first are wonderful now. <br />But the best part of the whole album is the emotional control it exerts. Each song can start off a whole array of emotions, sometimes conflicting. Sometimes it makes my heart ache to listen because of all the emotional investment, but trust me, it is WELL worth it.<br />Please buy this wonderful, original album, and force all of your friends to listen to it just once. And then go buy On Avery Island so you can feed your new Neutral Milk Hotel addiction.
B000002UR7|5.0|This is a great debut album. The best songs on the cd are by far 'Creep' 'You' and 'Blow Out' most similar to how they are now. The other songs on the cd are just wonderful. But I wouldn't recomend this cd to anyone that is only a fan of there new stuff like 'Kid A' or 'Amnesiac' this cd for hardcore fans only. If you liked them from the start then you'll love them to the end.
B00000163G|5.0|This album is by far the best album ever recorded!  ... Most everyone that listens to rap likes 2pac or at least this CD! ...  Tupac is the best lyricist in all of rap music...and always will be.  Tupac is deep, intellectual, spiritual, and never was afraid to state what was on his mind.<BR>...in fact, this is one of the (if not the) greatest recordings by the greatest rapper ever.<br />2pac 4eva!
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is like an extension of Kid A.(Being recorded at the same time) My boyfriend went as far to make a lame pun calling it Kid B. But it's okay with my because Kid A is their best album yet. I think it gives more of a fast jumpier feeling than Kid A, but in the same style.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This film was a delightful movie with an excellent funny character played by Val Kilmer. The story's main hero, Val's character, Madmartigan, is an outcast arrogant warrior who is always falling into trouble (or where touble seems to fine him). He is a selfish person that holds no scruples. Yet, we are drawn into the character by Ron Howard and watch his development into the noble savior of the ancient world. We are also drawn to the Warwick Davis character, Willow. Through Willow we see a person that has always been on a quest to attain meaning to his life. Often humiliated by his townspeople,Willow through his steadfastness, accomplishes a monumental task...in return he is granted his lifelong dream namely the powers of a wizzard. He can return to his village with pride and a hero's welcome. <br />Although this is an early Ron Howard directorial project, there are traces of the tenderness and feeling of the characters in the story as you, the audience, can sense. This film is funny and suspenseful. I would recommend this film to all age groups young and old.
B000002TQV|5.0|I love this album!!! This is like a before there made it big original rock cd. Just a perfect example on where they came from and where they were headed. This is a intense album full of feeling. It really get's the feeling they want out there the best part about it is that almost every song on the cd has a different emotion but unlike other mismatched cds from other bands, The Bends totally flows together. Amazing
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I enjoyed this excellent musical. To my surprise, both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (yes the same Obi-Wan)can hold a tune. The story plays out to an excellent script with song after song in delightful fashion. This is a very uplifting film despite being a 'Greek Tragedy'. If you haven't seen the film, you will be missing an experience. If you have seen the film already, watching this again will bring on a smile.

If your not a blood and guts viewer, avoid this episode...otherwise sit back and see Westley Snipes perform in his morbid action sequences.

The story follows the events following her death and how that affects her, her family and friends.<br />This book tore me up, in places, tears flowing and a heart-ache that wouldn't quit. It is an amazing emotional ride, well worth the read.<br />I too agree the ending was a bit abrupt, but it doesn't diminish from what is the best book I have read in a very long time. Wonderful job, Alice!
B00003CXI1|2.0|Those were the words that kept flashing through my mind as I sat speechless in the cinema watching the credits roll.  I couldn't believe I had spent two years eagerly anticipating this...well, I can't even think up a name for it that wouldn't anger other readers.  I can only think of one word in relation to the movie: why?  Why would someone want to take one of the most remarkable children's books ever written and reduce it to a pile of special effects, all for the sake of making some cash?  The whimsy and magic of the book are dumped by the roadside in favor of a lot of CGI designed solely to make people go 'wow'.  These children live in a school, but you would hardly know it from watching the movie, because the three main characters say scarcely a single word to any other child apart from each other.  They appear to live in almost complete isolation.  The interrelationships between all the children, the small details about their teachers, their lessons and their general routine, the little things that make the books so special, find no adequate equivalent in the film.  They were probably considered too ordinary or too boring to be put on screen; but in that case, Chris Columbus should realize the fact that some of us go to the movies to see more than just neat special effects (not all of which, come to think of it, were all that neat).  <br />If you're interested in character development, do not look here for it.  Very few of the supporting cast got as much screen time as they deserved.  Often there was only enough time to introduce a character and then leave them hanging in the air.  The animosity between Harry and Malfoy, or in particular between Ron and Malfoy, was barely explored.  This was not helped by the fact that Malfoy looked hardly threatening enough to hurt a fly.  I sincerely hope someone will give Tom Felton a few more acting lessons before the next movie comes out.  The dislike that Harry and Ron felt for Hermione at the start of the book is also largely ignored by the filmakers.  I realize that when making a movie like this one a lot of things have to be cut by necessity, but some things really are crucial to a plot.  The movie is devoted to the special effects.  Scenes without a 'wow' factor in them are cut out, unless they are really needed to explain the scenes with lots of special effects.  <br />I know also that when hiring children actors, it is unwise to expect a lot, but this is completely ridiculous.  Harry seems to have three facial expressions throughout the movie: the mildly surprised one, the very surprised one, and the one where he is in a state of utter shock.  Oh yeah, and now and again, he nods thoughtfully at one or other of his friends.  Rupert Grint tries far too hard to act; he's constantly overdoing his part, whether he's trying to be funny or scared or amazed or whatever.  At first, I found him rather endearing, but afterwards he quickly got on my nerves.  <BR>Robbie Coltraine is really good as Hagrid, in one of the few convincing performances of the movie, and so is Emma Watson as the law-abiding Hermione.  Ian Hart is a brilliant Professor Quirrell, and John Hurt brings a rare moment of magic to the screen as Mr Ollivander.  Besides these, the performances are fairly solid, but never memorable, and the actors generally miss that spark that would make them great in their respective roles.  <br />Children will probably enjoy this film because it is, after all, Harry Potter, and they may like the sets and visuals.  <BR>If you're an adult and you wish to see a great fantasy movie, check out Lord of the Rings.  It's got great characters, great action, a screenplay that is a worthy adaptation of the original book, wonderful cinematography, actors that can actually act, and a beautiful score.  What more could you ask for?  <BR>As for this movie, I gave it two stars because out of respect for the book, which I love with all my heart, I could not give it any less.  However, be warned.  I am very surprised that J.K. Rowling approved of this movie when she saw it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Delightful mix of playful and passionate songs that perfectly showcase Norahs talent. This girl is sure to take the industry, and our hearts, by storm!
6305366160|5.0|This is simply one of the best movies you'll ever buy.  I saw it in the theater and couldn't rest until I got it on video.  However now, as an adult (25) I got it for my children as well, since I let someone borrow it and they kept it!  That's how good the movie was.<br />There is a lot of Christmas spirit in this film, just like the first one.  But it is a lot funnier and the stunts more incredible.  This time Kevin it's transported to New York alone while his family flies to Florida (the proccess will make you laugh), then faces the villains Larry &amp; Marv who scaped from jail, and even stops them from stealing the money from a toy store that was to be donated to the Children's Hospital.  That's what really got to Kevin's tender little heart.  He could'nt let them get away with this!  No Siree!<br />The plot is funny from the moment the movie begins, Boss (his older brother) embarrases him in public in a Christmas recital, then he fights back and ruins the recital.  Boss then falsely apologizes to Kevin in front of his family, but mom get's mad when Kevin wont apologize back.  I could stay here all night but &quot;a picture is worth more than a million words&quot; so see it for yourself.<br />I remember that everyone applauded in the theater at the end of this movie.  :)
0316666343|1.0|The concept of a dead girl living in heaven and watching her loved ones is not an original concept, but it is an unusual motif in modern American literature.  This uniqueness among literary novels and the great reviews that Ms. Sebold garnered from the press were what drew me to buy this novel.<br />While it was a noble effort from a first-time author, the novel was sorely lacking.  Despite the serious nature of the topic--a young girl is brutally raped and murdered--Lovely Bones fails to describe Susie Salmon's story with any kind of depth.  Most of the characters (the father, the mother, the detective, Ray) are weak and superficial, one of the characters is extremely weird (Ruana Singh), and a number of the characters are simply not believable (Mr. Harvey, Lindsay, Ray, and especially Ruth Connors, the girl who \\"sees dead people\\").  Everyone in this novel has the same personality.  All are sad, hurt, and have no control over their lives.  Few of the characters show real anger.  They're simply sad, defeated, and helpless.  <br />Sebold tries to give the book some color by adding in a variety of different kinds of characters, but even in this, she fails.  Ray Singh, for example, is described as an \\"exotic\\" Indian from Britain and is one of the only nonwhite characters in the book/town.  Yet only Susie and Ruth seem to be aware of this fact.  No one else makes reference to this fact, and most treat him like any other white character.  Even Ray himself seems to think he's white; the poor lad himself has no ethnic identity whatsoever.  Is this realistic?  As an Asian American, I would say no.  What is the point of having ethnic characters without developing their unique perspectives?  If you talk to real Indian-Americans, you'll never find one like Ray.  Most Indian-Americans are proud of their culture.  <br />To add to the vapid character set, the book suffers from a lack of originality.  Sebold often resorts to cliche.  Grandma Lynn, for example, is the stereotypical, spunky, not-afraid-to-talk-about-sex grandmother.  Ever see the character Mona on the sit-com \\"Who's the Boss?\\"  That's Grandma Lynn transported from literary form--just change the name.  I don't want to give too much away for those who decide to read this book, but there was also one scene which is borrowed almost exactly from the movie \\"Ghost,\\" only instead of a dance, there's sex.  Sebold even speaks of the \\"cloudy mass\\" of dead spirits that come to escort Susie back to heaven.  If this doesn't sound familiar, go to BlockBuster and see for yourself.  \\"Ghost\\" even has better special effects.  <br />In short, I would recommend passing on this book.  Good concept, but it just doesn't pull through.
B00005QDW1|5.0|After the solid adult approach of 2000's &quot;Return To Saturn&quot;,No Doubt  dump the moody torch songs in favor for some boogie   shoes in good favor on &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.After two hit duets,with Eve and Moby respectively(the lazy Dr. Dre bump of the summer smash &quot;Let<BR>Me Blow Your Mind&quot; and the skittish techno-pop of &quot;South Side&quot;),No Doubt's ever-present frontwoman,the irreplacable Gwen Stefani  became ND's unoffical face.Yeah drummer Adrian Young's naked antics will catch some attention in ND's video but Gwen's fun,earthy,geniune Libra spirit makes everyone from rock fanatics to hip hop heads a fan.Hence No Doubt's huge accessibility.<br />&quot;Rock Steady&quot; is a fun,nervy ride with funky results.Dabbling with a lot of reggae(the album's title is in reference to the type of dancehall popular in Jamaica),soul,new wave,bossa nova, funk,and of course...ska,ND strech their musical muscles.Many non-rock fans will like this album.One of the main reasons that No Doubt's music has been so appealing is in the energy even with the bittersweet songs that comprised &quot;Return To Saturn&quot;,ND<BR>always had a lot of energy and spirit in their music.<BR>And that continues with such cuts as the irrestible dance track<BR>&quot;Hella Good&quot;,the bubbly bubblegum-funk/pop of &quot;Hey Baby&quot;,the smooth,retro reggae pop-soul of &quot;Underneath It All&quot;(destined to be a big radio hit),the crackling fun of &quot;Making Out&quot;,and the roof raising dancehall anthem of &quot;Start The Fire&quot;.See,tracks that use a heavy reggae influence like &quot;Underneath&quot; and &quot;Start&quot; use reggae very authenically.It's not a trendy pose here but rather a honest attempt to broaden their horizions and give the fans a little something new.<br />The lithing title track along with the obligitory rockier track<BR>&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; also deserve some mention.As there isn't really a bad track on &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.Maybe the filler tracks &quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; but the pot really gets boiling with the album's best track:the Prince-assisted &quot;Waiting Room&quot;.Over funky tribal beats and a sultry guitar lick,Gwen and the Purple One slither all over the track recalling the listener of Prince's golden days with Shelia E or<BR>Appolonia or Wendy &amp; Lisa.Invoking the past but marrying it with the future,it's exactly what &quot;Waiting Room&quot; does perfectly.<br />No Doubt succeed yet again while taking some chances with a new sound.And please old No Doubt fans/rock fans don't try to run around calling these guys &quot;sell-outs&quot;.Being openminded and trying out a new sound isn't &quot;selling out&quot;,it's called evolution.And &quot;Rock Steady&quot; shows that evolution happening in tip-top shape.

This is the corniest movie I believe I have ever seen. <br />I also have a problem with this guy being molded into a hero who stands up to the big, bad, anti-Communists (who were equally menacing and buffoonish at the same time...a feat Hollywood and the media usually credit to Republican presidents). Not only that, but the deceased Medal of Honor winner war hero would have stood up to those big, bad, anti-Communists, too, if he could have (yeah, right) - and from him, Carrey's character gets his inspiration. Uh huh. <br />Hollywood is so predominantly liberal that I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by the underlying message here. I'm as against innocent people being dragged before congressional committees as the next guy, but come ON. <br />Communism actually IS bad, but they never mention that.<br />There wasn't a single believable thing in this movie. It stunk. I just hope kids who see this junk don't think this is the way it really was, but I suspect that's what the creators of this sugar-coated propaganda are hoping.
B00000260F|4.0|Nobody argues that this was one of the worst PRODUCED and CONCEIVED Jeff Beck albums ever, including Jeff himself.

I also find the Jan Hammer track &quot;Escape&quot;, which won a Grammy by the way, to be a very cool 1980s flashback. Overlook some of the horrendous vocals, and listen to the guitar solos---true Jeff Beck fans know it's all here, just sift through the garbage to get to it.
B00005JLDW|2.0|... Now audiences are presented with something called REIGN OF FIRE starring Christian Bale (who is fine casting) and Matthew McCaughnahay (who seems to chew his lines as much as he enjoys rubbing his bald head and chews his cigar). Too bad for the dragon. He has little to do. While the adds made this film out to be like BLACK HAWK DOWN meets DRAGONSLAYER, the actual plot is a total letdown. The effects are good. The 'castle' is a reject from some old ROAD WARRIOR film. And the supporting cast are simply in the picture to become toasted weenies for the dragon's breath. The lead female is wasted unless you enjoy just watching a pretty face and nothing else. I love a good dragon story. I love dragons. They are the flip side of the unicorn. Bad vs. good. Dragons fascinate. ...
B00004XPQ2|5.0|The key to this film is the interaction of the major characters, and the underlying motivations of each.  The principal interaction is between Alec Guinness' character, and that of Sessue Hayakawa's.  There is a secondary, but important interaction between William Holden's character, and Jack Hawkins as yet another British commander.  And then there's the interaction of sorts, although the two characters are separated from each other for the major part of the film, Between Holden's and Guinness' characters.  <br />There is the problem of historical inaccuracy here.  The portrayal of deep issues is given precedence over fact.  The separate values governing each person's actions are spotlighted.  Colonel Nicholson's perspective does appear warped, and he is the true tragic protagonist of the story.  His nationalistic pride and an ego driving him to show superiority through building the best and strongest bridge although doing so aids the Japanese military blinds him to the reality of the situation.  <br />The slow development of the plot will discourage many who have been exposed primarily to current films which cater heavily to more physical sensations at the expense of mental and spiritual considerations.  But gaining the insight possible through this classic is worth the effort, even if it means multiple viewings, for those who are willing to take it.
B000063COX|5.0|This is Iron Maiden's rawest-sounding album and one of my favorites.  The first side (sorry, but I'm a vinyl girl!) starts off with the energetic track \\"Prowler\\" and ends with the monster 7-minute anthem \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (this track was covered by the female-led band Sentinel Beast, and they did a splendid job on it).  The second side is launched by one of Maiden's best instrumentals \\"Transylvania\\" and sums up with their signature (and fun) track \\"Iron Maiden.\\"  This album also has two of Maiden's more famous numbers that followed them throughout the band's career \\"Charlotte The Harlot\\" and fan favorite \\"Running Free.\\"  Paul Di'Anno is a different vocalist than Bruce Dickinson.  He doesn't wail and his voice has a touch of soul.  He does wonderful vocal work, especially on slower tracks \\"Remember Tomorrow\\" and \\"Strange World\\" (both beautiful). This album is raw and it's interesting listening to this record and then to the sophisticated material Maiden would later produce (Powerslave, Seventh Son, etc.).  I like this album best for its variety--from the straight forward, fun rock songs to the tranquil ballads, to the more involved tracks like \\"Opera.\\"  If all you know about Maiden is the Dickinson years, give this album and their second release Killers a shot!
6305014140|1.0|Personally, it is a grievance upon my heart that so many enjoyed this movie.  I had nothing better to do in high school a few years ago, so I asked my friend (rather, a random guy) to name-drop some epic anime that I could rent.  He/she/it/whatever told me to rent \\"Ninja Scroll,\\" so I subsequently did so, realizing from those cheesy \\"Akira\\" commercials that this probably wasn't \\"Family Circus\\", or even \\"Family Guy\\".  I tried my best to watch it from an objective point of view, but I think I lost all interest during a particularly nasty scene where 20 guys get sliced literally in half, spewing out blood like Old Faithful during earthquake season.  Of course, the following scene, this really disgusting looking rock golem dude talking trash (and doing much worse, believe me folks) to this girl who oddly enough, must have been resistant to his insanely sharp blade...believe me when I say that what this guy said has to be on my list of one of the most appalling things ever uttered.  Of course, I'm sure fans of hentai can come up with about 100 worse things, just from the title screens.  Anyways, after becoming permanently scarred, I watch a spriteful bit of jumping around non-sensically from place to place, meeting hollow characters along the way, getting in a few family-oriented (i.e. less than enough blood spilled to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool) fights. Take numerous unforgettable characters like \\"Old Toady Codger with the bad voice\\", \\"Bee Hive Man\\" and \\"Lady who saves on those costly trips to Big Lots by only wearing Snakes\\", add a few unforgettable scenes, like \\"big stupid guy gets oddly enough covered in molten gold\\", and stick in more blood, violence, and perversion than you can shake an enema at, and you have this timeless flick.
B00005JKQX|2.0|This movie was terribly slow.  It reached a climax early on when he came up with his theory, and then declined.  The three big awards that it received were undeserved (Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actress).  Jennifer Connelly is a fine actress, but the role was not incredibly challenging (see Requiem for a better performance).  On the other hand, Russell Crowe's role was extremely complex and he rose to the occasion.  He should have received an Oscar for this role, and not for Gladiator.  Lastly, Ron Howard should stick to less dramatic, less demanding movies.  He is better off making less artistic, more entertaining movies like Parenthood and Ransom.
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|Ok, guys, here's the deal.  If you're really into horror movies (as opposed to thrashing them, like me), have religiously watched every major horror movie in the 90's, and don't wanna take yourself so seriously, then this certainly is for you.  I'm sure that, an avid fan of \\"Scream\\" or \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" with a really filthy mouth and raunchy sense of humor would enjoy this flick.  Personally, I found it too...coerced.  The funny scenes in the movie, excluding the ones about sex, were just hammed up too much and over-scripted to be funny, except if you absolutely LOVE Adam Sandler and are used to this approach.  In my opinion, if you want parody movies, look up Mel Brooks, or that \\"Kung Pow: Enter the Fist\\"...or just rent the \\"Dentist 2\\" or \\"The Ice Cream Man\\" and do your own MST3K.

0140386335|5.0|It annoys me to read reviews calling this book another \\"fairy story\\" or a \\"watership down;\\" it is much more complex, up to par with the greatest modern writers/philosophers of our time, yet written to thrill all ages.  For instance, some fantasy books tell great stories just for the fun of it (like The BFG), some are made to teach certain morals (like The Phantom Tollbooth), some are influenced by a religion (like christianity elements in the Chronicals of Narnia or A Wrinkle in Time) or region, but all forms of entertainment offer an \\"escape\\" from \\"reality,\\" which is why I don't like it when critics call this book (or anything else that doesn't drool over the latest in politics and financial gain) \\"escapist literature.\\" It deals with the elements of what makes us dream and why we wish, in a story that takes its main character (and you with him) out of himself and into himself in an amazing journey to find himself or lose himself forever.  Michael Ende, whose father was a surrealist painter, grew up in Germany in the earlier part of the last century. His children's books are a good read (Momo, The Night of Wishes, etc.) though not up to par with NES; his adult books are surreal and could scare the pants off of Nietzche (Mirror in the Mirror); NES has elements of both genres,<BR>a great combination of fantasy, unforgettable characters, horrifying emptiness, ambition, amazing landscapes, battles, youthful innocence, friendship, influences from stories in lands all over the world (sphinx, oracle, ivory tower, monastaries, knights, warriors, gnomes, will-o'the wisps, etc.), plus a great many of his own inventions (Rockchewers, luckdragons, windgiants, a picture mine, Bastian, etc.) brilliantly intertwining what is \\"real\\" and what is \\"imaginary,\\" and a sprinkling of startling questions. I find the green and red print hard to read; I prefer the version that uses standard black ink with italic letters (instead of red ink) to indicate Bastian's side of the \\"Outer World.\\"  What I find most delightful about this book is that it changes every time I read it.  I've loved it as a child, loved Atreyu, Falkor and all of the characters. I have reread it many, many times to adulthood.  It's the same story, the words haven't changed, but readers do and there's always something new to discover in Fantastica, or Bastian's world, or your own world.  If you are (or were) a kid with a passion for fantastic books, then this book is definitly for you.  Have a magnificent read.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Here's a switch:  I recommend this DVD if you did NOT like the movie.<br />I thought Phantom Menace was OK when I saw it in the theatre - looked and sounded great but it was less than met the eye. This was what I expected since I've never gotten excited about the old trilogy - sorry Star Wars fans! I was not upset about it since I had no emotional investment in the original, I just thought this movie was better than the old ones because it looked and sounded better.<br />After a long weekend of viewing the hours of incredible extras on this DVD I became a George Lucas fan. When I watched Phantom Menace again, it was with different eyes. It still has the same oft-mentioned shortcomings, but knowing the intention of the creator I'm now able to watch it in a different way than I do other movies. And as a creative artist and performer I was awestruck by the extraordinary quality of work done on every aspect of it by a huge array of exceptional people in every creative category.<br />No, characterization, dialogue and a conventional plot are not George's forte - nor is that really what he's after. If you watch Phantom Menace knowing his vision it becomes a different film.
6302510341|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot;. I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as &quot;Kong&quot;, and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, however, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious &quot;Kong&quot;.<br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious &quot;Kong&quot; is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of &quot;Kong&quot;. Notwithstanding the fact that &quot;Kong&quot; has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls &quot;King Kong&quot; and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, &quot;King Kong&quot; makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic.

B00005LKIN|3.0|This is a well acted film with marvelous performances by the entire cast. Julianne Moore, reprising Jodie Foster's role as FBI agent, Clarissa Starling, is superlative, and Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal Lecter, is once again sublime. The supporting cast, which includes Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini, are also terrific. The problem with the movie is not with the cast, but with its penchant for trying to shock the audience with gore and monstrous scenes of anthroprophagy that revolt, rather than merely shock, the viewer.<br />Ten years after his escape from custody, Hannibal Lecter resurfaces in Florence, Italy, of all places. After him is Mr. Mason, a fabulously wealthy, but disgusting piece of human vermin and former moltester of children, who was horribly disfigured many years ago with a little help from Hannibal who had been his psychiatrist. He is on the hunt for Hannibal as is, of course, Starling. Who will get to Hannibal first or, better yet, who will Hannibal get to first, is the question that begs to be answered. Unfortunately, Liotta, as a greedy Departman of Justice spokesperson and Giannini, as a greedy Italian police officer, get in Hannibal's way by providing assistance to Mr. Mason, much to their detriment, as the viewer will find out.<br />While given to some excess, this is still an interesting film. Despite his proclivity for human flesh, Anthony Hopkins manages to make Hannibal Lecter everything anyone could ever hope for in a dinner companion: exquisitely mannered, cultured, intelligent, and charming. Just make sure that you are not the main course.<br />This movie is definitely not for the squeamish.
0553103547|5.0|A game of thrones is different. It's better. I've spent years rooting through the impressive fantasy collections of the biggest bookstores and finally gave up trying to find new favourites. Most of the books written in the last ten years all revolve around the same type of plot, with a firmly established \\"Dark Lord\\" and \\"Only-he-can-save-the-world-guy\\". Most of the authors have no experince with writing and just wan to make some cash an present their dungeons and dragons adventures before the world. Mistakes in grammer, plot and character generation are common. A game of thrones is better though. Everything has a new, original feel to it. From the intriguing, gripping plot(One of the few that has kept me awake till seven in the morning) to the appealing variety of characters.<br />Lord Eddard Stark is forced to leave his home in the north to serve his lifelong friend, King Robert, as \\"the Hand of The King\\". The Queen, however, has evil intentions. Eddard must survive in the murky world of politics while trying to come to grips with the king he knows has changed. His honour and integrity is one scruple to many in this city where everyone appears hostile. Members of his family go their own way or have to learn to get along without him, as multiple story lines demonstrate, with each chapter continuing the story from the point of view of a different one of the main characters. This revolves around only a few though, so no need to be apprehensive of endlessly changing heroes. Mainly they are Starks family. Threats build up from all sides, however, and all the Starks will be needed to fill in their own part.<br />Read it. You will NOT be dissapointed. I would rate it higher than Raymond Feist or Terry Goodkind and the others(this is my own, personal opinion, I dont want to antagonize any of the millions of their fans!).
B00005B1W5|5.0|I am a woodwind instrumentalist and Pedro Eustache is my new idol! All the musicians are awesome. This video was an inspiration. Yanni is the man!!!! All the music was superb and it grooved. I recommend this to all my fellow musicians. This is just straight up great music, no categories.
B000067CPX|3.0|Simply put: Beautiful music in a more mellow direction. RHCP is one of the reasons that I keep faith and love in music. I've been listening since after Uplift Mofo Party Plan and have watched their music grow and develop over the years. I listened to and enjoyed Mother's Milk as a preteen and then was blasted away with Blood Sugar Sex Magik when I hit my teenage years. I still contend it's a masterpiece and their best release. I thought maybe they peaked when I heard One Hot Minute, although it had a few great songs. When Californication came out, I expected less, and was somewhat pleasantly surprised. This album really shows that they aren't going anywhere from the music scene, but are definately stepping away from the sound I fell in love with.  <br />Their music has obviously grown and matured since they sang about true men killing coyotes to a wonderful, yet raw and immature, sound that I loved for BSSM. It then grew and matured again for Californication. This addition seems like a huge step into a direction of music that they love and a sound that they are happy with.  As a fan, I can only support it even though I long for the rougher, more immature sound.<br />I was somewhat disappointed to not hear a large Flea presence as much as the other albums, but he makes his presence a little more known on tracks like 7 and 10.  Track 13 made me want to skank, something I would expect from listening to early No Doubt or something.<br />I really dug The Beach Boys influence. I thought maybe it was just me speculating until I heard Tear. I guess you could chalk up some Beatles influence too. I'm also wondering about the possibility of some Neil Young influence. <br />Final words: Buy this one. If you want to sit around and hold BSSM and claim they never put out a good one since, then you're just going to miss out on some beautiful music.  Don't turn your back on them when they treated you so well.
0060930187|5.0|While I am not a fan of her poetry (OK, I admit it, I don't like any poetry, sorry if I lose culture points), Plath's The Bell Jar is brilliant, and still rings true today. Esther is a brilliant, prideful woman in a world where women aren't supposed to be either and are instead supposed to be like a minor character in the book whom Esther despises--a typical suburban cow, whining kids in tow. At the end of The Bell Jar, I believe we are supposed to ask the question, is Esther crazy or is her madness an appropriate reaction to the world in which she lives? The answer I believe is the latter. This book is a must read for every sensitive individual, male or female, who doesn't (or doesn't want to) think of the typical hysterical, shrieky, irritating stereotype when he or she hears the phrase \\"women and depression\\".
B00004T8RK|2.0|Now, first off, I'd just like to say that I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and think everything they did was brilliant.<br />That is, until Binaural.<br />You see, &quot;Binaural&quot; tries so hard to be the next &quot;Dark Side of The Moon&quot;, and it falls flat on its face. Pearl Jam were NOT meant to be a psychedelic/acoustic group at all. They are at their best when they're making rock anthems, whether they be straight-forward ones (&quot;Ten&quot;, &quot;Vs.&quot;) or hidden treasures (&quot;Vitalogy&quot;). THERE IS NOT ONE DECENT ROCK SONG ON THE ALBUM. No matter how hard &quot;Grievance&quot; and &quot;Rival&quot; try, neither of them are normal PJ quality. <br />So please Pearl Jam, with your next album (planned to release in November), go back to rock. Your fanbase will mutiply and you'll be the biggest band in the world again.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Whilst it promises to be a high-quality feel-good movie, \\"Chocolat\\" cannot escape the emotional and socio-political stereotypes which have become so common in current film making. Juliette Binoche plays a rather smug, ostracised single mother who arrives in a provincial French village and opens a cuter-than-cute, better-than-perfect chocolate shop. Her arrival is treated with great suspicion by the locals, particularly the church and the mayor but along the way she manages to establish a limited women-only clientelle. The arrival on the scene of Johnny Depp as the love-interest adds further fuel to the rather structured plot.<br />The predictable and frequently turgid storyline is supported by flat and unspectacular performances, particularly Binoche, and a singular lack of chemistry between any of the characters. The overall characterisations are very polarised; all the men are against our heroine; all the women are for her. In even simpler terms, all the men are essentially evil except for Johnny Depp, whose token good-guy-in-bad-guy's-clothing character is no fault of his own. Depp and Judi Dench do their best with what they have but Depp, in particular, has almost nothing to work with because his character is so shallow.<br />The underlying philosophical point of this film centering around a chocolate shop seems to be that ancient customs and beliefs were superior to modern ones and that indulgence in chocolate is the key to true happiness and enlightenment. It is very easy to be critical of recent attitudes; indeed it has become fashionable, but it does not mean that the ways of ancient civilizations (particularly superficial ones) were necessarilly superior to ours. In this aspect the film resolves nothing and as a viewer, I would prefer not to be lectured to.<br />Overall, I found this film very disappointing and there are far better, less indulgent, feel-good films around. One could be excused for thinking that, with its killer cast, it would be much betterthan it is. It gets two stars for cinematography and loses everything else for cornball cliches and crude stereotypes.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|Gold was a commercial breakthrough for Ryan Adams, who has made some brilliant music, especially with his old outfit, Whiskeytown. If one great underground talent deserves this success it's Ryan; however, it's now up to him to use his new found clout to put out great music to the masses. Gold isn't really,awful,just average and unremarkable. If it was made by anyone else I wouldn't have given it a second look/listen. He has a knack for the unpredictable and messing with people's notions of what he's about like Alex Chilton did after his notoriety with Big Star;being thought of as a Beatle pop genius then making the experimental Third album.I saw Whiskeytown after they released the very countryish and acoustic Stranger's Almanac, and the show was more Replacements style punky than the country show I was expecting. I heard that a recent Philadelphia show began with a long, extended jam reminiscent of 70's arena rock that baffled yuppies who came to hear the recent hits. I think Ryan will be back, and who knows what it will be like. Like everybody I guess he needed to make his money.
B00000JXZ7|5.0|I'll be honest; I bought this CD for the recording of the Bruch Violin Concerto. I have never really been a great fan of the Mendelssohn work included here but I enjoyed the Scottish Fantasia, which sort of made up for it. I have been aware of this recording for 20 years but I had not heard it until I bought it. My previous standard by which I measured the Bruch was the wonderful Oistrakh version of the same work, recorded in the 1960's. The dynamics of this piece were not previously as apparent to me as now and there are passages in this recording which really make my hair stand on end. Kyung Wha Chung makes the instrument speak as I have never heard it before and that, combined with a subtlety as well as some blistering runs, started to really speak of the genius of Max Bruch. A good performer can do a piece justice but it takes a great one to give the listener an insight into the ability and intention of the composer. Kyung Wha Chung really raised the bar with this one.
B000066F6H|5.0|THE OVERALL CAPACITY OF THIS CD IS INTELLECTUAL TO A POINT OF CENTRIFICUL MOTION ON AN ISOSOLIES TRIANGLE.

0694003611|5.0|\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the book my nephews always ask for before they go to bed, and I don't blame them.  A soothing rhythm and quiet, sleepy illustrations make this the perfect bedtime story for little ones.  It's amazing how simple the story seems, yet it works like a charm: by the end, my nephews are heavy-lidded and peaceful.  This book has been in my family for a long time; my mother read it to me, and my sisters now read it to their children.  If I have kids of my own someday, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the first story I plan on reading to them.
B000051VWW|5.0|I bought this album and was to attended her &quot;Lovers Rock Tour&quot; concert at the Jones Beach Amphitheatre.  The album reflects 8 years of growth since &quot;Love Deluxe&quot;.  <br />The entire album is built on complex textures and solid grooves provided by her extremely talented band.  The first three songs &quot;By Your Side&quot;, &quot;Flow&quot;, and &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; seem to continue in the same voice she established in &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; 8 year prior.  Sultry, brooding grooves.  Starting with &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; (the song that received the most airplay from this collection) the album becomes more introspective.  Sade sings about what she has always expressed best, her own journeys and experiences.  She speaks of hope and the strength that derives from faith that sustained those that were forced endure the passage into slavery in &quot;Slave Song&quot; and of the strength provided by familial love in &quot;The Sweetest Gift&quot;   My personal favorite was &quot;Every Word&quot;.  A beautifully crafted song on the subject of love betrayed.  &quot;Immigrant&quot; is a song penned as a tribute to her father and his struggles as an newly arrived Nigerian immigrant in the land of &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (United Kingdom) and his fight for acceptance.  The last 2 songs, the title track, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot; speak about the only currency that will make your life richer, love.<br />At her concert, sitting under the stars with a gentle breeze blowing in from the Atlantic, the music of this album, as much as any of Sade's work, seemed the perfect compliment to the beauty surrounding me.  Sade has completed another chapter in the book of her life and loves.  It is always a pleasure walking in Sade's garden.
0790734850|5.0|For an example of the best in film noir, look no further than \\"L.A. Confidential\\", a sleek, fiery look into the seamy side of life in the L.A. of the 1950s.  The cast is a dream: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce (\\"Memento\\"), Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell, David Strathairn.  I've often thought the Oscars should have a category for Best Ensemble Cast; \\"Gosford Park\\" should have won it this year, and \\"L.A. Confidential\\" should have won it back in '97.  Under the capable direction of Curtis Hanson (\\"Wonder Boys\\", the upcoming \\"8 Mile\\"), this film is a riveting triumph.  Highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A friend handed me this album an hour ago and having been through it once I can honestly say it's an instant classic with me.<br />Jones's voice is soothing and exquisite.  Much of the album is actually blues and she does a fantastic job at it.  She borrows vocal patterns heavily from Bonnie Raitt, but does it with her own style and elegance.  She doesn't belt out the emotional parts like many of the blues artists of the past - at times i *really* wanted her to, too! - though I suspect she could, effortlessly.<br />Keep an eye on this girl; she's very talented.
B000002AGY|5.0|To my astonishment, the centerpiece of this disk, Concierto de Aranjuez, stands up to the legendary Miles Davis recording. I love this long cut so much that if there is any noise, like a leaf blower or a helicopter, I have to turn it off.<BR>   The rest of the disk is good too, but this cut finds the dark places in my heart.
B000062XFG|3.0|This season of star trek was very fickle.  It had moments of brilliants, Measure of a Man amd its moments of disapointment, Outrageous Okona.  Still it was provokative and entertaining so if you enjoy Star Trek or sci/fi, you will probably appreciate season two on DVD.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I didn't watch the movie with any expectations and for this reason, thoroughly enjoyed it.  I saw the movie in the theater and preordered it soon after.  Order the DVD version and listen to Milla in the commentary section.  She's pretty funny.  If you are looking for zombies, this is the movie for you.
B00005AR3G|5.0|I was more than pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie.  The mix of comedy appeals to kids with more veiled humor for adults.  And this isn't just a one-time movie - I've watched it a dozen times and it's just as entertaining every time.  David Spade is very funny and Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, Wendy Malik, and Patrick Warburton only add to the entertainment.  <br />I, like many, had given up hope for another truly comedic and enjoyable Disney movie after Aladdin, but this has restored my faith in Disney's ability to create a movie fit for all ages.  There are so many different levels to this movie and many quotes from the movie will stick in your head after the movie is over.  Enjoy!
0790731509|5.0|Cool Hand Luke is one of my favorite movies, and the best movie Newman has made to date. Everyone who has seen it seems to love it. This is the role that guys like Newman, Brando, and Dean were born to play. The dvd is a bit of a let down, since there are no extras, but with a movie this good, you don't need extras.
B000069HKH|4.0|The press keeps touting this as the saving grace for America and Bruce's answer to 9/11. While there certainly is reference to that event it is much more than that. This is a seminal performance by a recently dormant artist. There are 4 or 5 songs on this disc that are among Bruce's finest. Songs like &quot;You're Missing&quot;, &quot;My city of Ruins&quot; and &quot;The Rising&quot; are sad and redemptive at the same time. &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; is a great song. While you can read Sept. 11th into almost any of these songs, You can also relate it to any tragic or defining moment in a life. This is a 50 year old man talking about mortality and vitality. This is Bruce's version of Dylan's Time out of Mind. Don't expect a repeat performance of any old E-Street album. Bruce is not going to make those albums again. He's changed and grown. We should all grow with him.
067144901X|5.0|Oh my, the cow and sheep seem to have it right...but what about the pigs? This divinely witty animal-sounds book had my own babies in stitches when they were almost too young to look at the pictures.<br />The rhythmic cadence of the words (always a grabber for the very young), the simple wording, the silliness that can be enhanced by mom or dad's tone of voice when reading aloud, and most of all, the use of the word \\"you,\\" bringing the child into the story, combine to make a treasure of a book.<br />Oh...did I mention Sandra Boynton's incredibly endearing pictures of animals? Rendered in bright, beautiful colors on sturdy, indestructible pages, they are worth the price of the book. I'll bet you anything you sneak one more look long after night-night.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Star Trek - The Motion Picture - The Director's Edition works much better than all the previous versions of the film. Despite it being slightly longer than the theatrical release the plot is carried at a more natural, less plodding pace.<br />The film has always benefitted from Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score, and the remastered soundtrack is now simply outstanding. It's sounds almost as if they've re-recorded it with modern equipment. Definitely worth consideration, a must have for fans of the original.
B00005NWM3|2.0|I bought this cd thinking that it was going to be good. I had heard the single How You Remind me and I thought it was good. The cd is anything but. The only songs that are half decent are Never Again and Too Bad and How You remind me, but once you have heard them a few times then they have served their cause. The rest of this cd is completely [junk]. This band should go for something a little more original and less repetitive. They should try and get more lyrics in instead of repeating themselves and make the music sound different on each song. This akbum is just rushed and a waste of money.
B0000683DH|4.0|Star Trek II has always been a very good and entertaining film and this DVD should appeal to most people. The extra scenes are quite brief but do add a bit more background to some of the characters. There are moments though when the additions seem almost superfluous, but on the whole add a bit more clarity to the story.<br />Annoyingly, the sound quality changes between these added scenes and the original edition. At one moment in the film, there is a noticeable pop when the scene changes - something that shouldn't has got past quality control. The sound overall is still okay, but the remastering hasn't gotten the quality up to the level in the previous edition in the series, Star Trek - The Motion Picture - Director's Edition.<br />One major bonus is of course, the extra features, and these are very well done. They are concise and interesting, and they don't, unlike some other DVD's, rely exclusively on one-on-one interviews with the production personnel and cast. There is a good mix of behind the scenes footage, especially in the documentary on the film's special effects.<br />Overall a worthwhile purchase, only let down by the uneven quality of sound.

B000002GK1|4.0|This whole album is exceptional, but you have to really like heavy, grinding rock to appreciate it the whole way through. Soundgarden's breakthrough, \\"Badmotorfinger,\\" is an hour's worth of some of the heaviest music to explode out of Seattle in the early 1990s. When it began, Soundgarden was hungry, musically brash and fluent at hardcore grunge riffs, speed metal and even fast punk. Like many of its Seattle contemporaries, Soundgarden had integrity, a shield that kept the crassness of the music industry biz at bay. The band stood above hype and overwrought marketing to create tunes like \\"Rusty Cage,\\" \\"Outshined\\" and \\"Jesus Christ Pose,\\" well-known and vintage Seattle rock from the early '90s. \\"Outshined\\" might outshine them all, a dark, chugging song that conveys singer Chris Cornell's bleak outlook of making it big. It's a big, loud, guitar-driven rock song with screaming vocals, but also contains soft vocals at certain interludes to give the song an unexpected melodic tone.<br /><br />The comparison of Led Zeppelin + Black Sabbath = Soundgarden is pretty accurate. Cornell has a Robert Plant-like voice in terms of range and depth, but it's shaded darker and comes off as more brooding. As hard as these guys were on their early albums, the riffs were complex enough to stand out from the headbanging crowd, while Cornell added his own melodic muse to the mix, making for a very interesting band. This album is filled with epic grunge/metal songs built to last. The dirge riffs of \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" go on for seven minutes, while Cornell sings like a man possessed -- God only knows how he hits those high notes. Like Zeppelin, these guys weren't afraid to stretch out their songs. Future Soundgarden CDs would incorporate lighter, more melodic elements into the picture, but the monochromatic \\"Badmotorfinger\\" contains none of that. More typical here is repetative riffing, as heard on the awesome \\"Jesus Christ Pose,\\" a railing tune against glittery, force-fed religion, similar in message to the much more tame \\"Wooden Jesus,\\" another Cornell-penned tune heard on [[ASIN:B000002GJH Temple of the Dog]]. Another huge tune from this CD, one sometimes heard on the radio if you're lucky, is \\"Searching with my Good Eye Closed,\\" a mid-tempo rocker that blends heavy riffage and Cornell's smooth singing -- in this case distorted with a layer of sheen for a cool effect. He also screams wildly in the song.<br /><br />As good as it was at drawn-out epics, Soundgarden could also be superstar punk rockers at the drop of a dime; listen to the raging \\"Face Pollution\\" and Who-like riffs on \\"Drawing Flies.\\" The versatility of this band was demonstrated more noticeably on future records, but Soundgarden also does a pretty good job of varying its sound on this one, though casual listeners might disagree. Because of its musical versatility and talent, Soundgarden were a hard band to categorize. Cornell has a wide vocal range, Ben Shepherd played a throbbing base, Kim Thayil is a very diverse guitar player and Matt Cameron, now of [[ASIN:B000ETQRCM Pearl Jam]], is as good as rock drummers get. Everyone in this band played a bit of everything, and each contributed to the writing (like in Pearl Jam).<br /><br />Appropriately, \\"Badmotorfinger\\" ends with two long, grungy songs that Soundgarden so thrived on during this era. Overall, it's easy to see why so many people were captivated with this band's music in the early '90s -- and why these sounds helped start a new trend in music. Hundreds of bands have tried to emulate certain elements of Soundgarden's sound in the studio, but it's hopeless because the nucleus of Chris, Kim, Ben and Matt was a one in a million shot.

0684803356|2.0|The plot, characters, etc. have all been discussed ad infinitum around here. Let's just say I was looking forward to my first Hemingway book. It took me three months to get through it. I'll read another one, but if it's anything like this one, maybe Ernie isn't for me.
6304602979|1.0|The main characters are two commonplace, identifiable, likable people, who very much fall in love, and then start killing other people in an orgy of mindless violence. After his first unnecessary murder He comes back home to tell her about it, and She starry eyed finds that what he did sooo romantic. At the end of the movie She too kills people, in one case for no better reason than apparently to stop her victim from making noise. <br />Now Pulp Fiction works because it is a parody, Natural Born Killers and Silence of Lambs works because in all their excess we understand that the killers are psychopaths. But here we are talking about normal people, and this makes True Romance incongruous through and through. It trivializes murder in a way I found deeply troubling. Sure, the actors get slapped around a bit before doing the killing, but this is such a flimsy and artificial excuse for introducing the murders that I found my intelligence insulted too. After seeing this movie I started thinking that Hollywood's love story with violence and the way that viewers in general have been anesthetized to it, does not bespeak well of the direction our culture is taking. This is not a trivial matter and I am not moralizing here. Cinema of this caliber is an art form, and art has power. <br />We do get a long string of recognizable actors, but I found their acting rather forced and pretentious. Technically the movie is ok, but I think that the director himself felt that something is wrong. In the specials he rather defensively claims that this movie is not about violence, but rather about true love being able to withstand violence. This does not make sense either: in this story it is the lovebirds themselves who start and cause the mayhem. The script writer could have achieved a very similar dark and violent effect, and could have helped create a much better movie, by having a loving couple of questionable (i.e. normal) morals being caught up in the violence and surviving -  But toexpress the idea that it was love that inspired and guided normal folks to murder, is really sick.

I can remember back in '94 when they emerged with one of the greatest debut albums of all time - people were saying &quot;They won't last!&quot; or &quot;They'll O.D. or break up next week!&quot;<br />Well, don't look now, but we're coming up on a DECADE of great ROCK AND ROLL from these turbulant brothers. And HEATHEN CHEMISTRY is yet another collection of excellent music. The only thing that has changed here is the band's more mature outlook and a new guitarist who grew on me from the first spin of the CD. He's great! <br />This CD takes several different turns - but around every corner is a pleasant surprise. Even the &quot;nay-sayers&quot; will have to lend an ear.(Watch their eye brows raise.)<br />It's just great to see Noel and Liam still working so well together. Great job guys!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Please don't be put off by the negative reviews... This is a fine album by a young and talented artist. Norah Jones has a sultry and sophisticated voice that belies her youth and is well suited to the musical selections on this cd. This is one of those rare mainstream albums that crosses generation gaps and the whole family can enjoy.
B000066NW0|3.0|I read she's no Britney Spears- WELL THANK GOD FOR THAT !!! Avril Levigne is probably more mature now at sixteen than Britney ever will be. Since when does being a mega-superstar qualify you to be so great anyway? Talk about OVERHYPE! Just look at all the knuckle-heads walking around with a ton of money and too much time on their hands, trouble following them around where-ever they go. ANYWAY, for a first album I thought LET GO is quite good, especially for a first effort. To me, a 3-star rating is GOOD, with not very many CD's rating 4-5 stars which would be very good and exceptional. I think Avril will make a mark for her-self and she won't have to be an over-rated \\"superstar\\" to do it. GO,AVRIL,GO!!

0790729628|1.0|I can't believe I didn't turn this movie off. I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing happened in the whole movie. It was a waste of my 2 hours and my $1 to rent it. The dvd is awful. Its got no special features, the menus are about as pretty as Christopher Lloyd in one flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. There was no plot to this movie, there was no action in this movie, there was no sex in this movie. So what's so good about it? I don't know. It was awful. Harrison Ford had about as much testosterone as the Olsen Twins. The evil man was an idiot and the naked woman was about as ugly as Whoopie Goldburg. Everybody on the internet rants and raves about this garbage so I figured I'd watch it. This is not a classic. I could have wrote this script in 5 minutes. I'm going to go watch Show Down in Little Tokyo now.

B000002LCU|5.0|I decided to try George Harrison for the first time, so I went out and bought this album. Mostly because it had \\"I got my mind set on you\\", but also because I was curious of this Ex-Beatle.<BR>My anticipation grow over the skies when I saw that Jeff Lynne, my favorite artist of all time had been working with Harrison on this album, giving it the \\"Touch of magic\\" he does.<BR>And so, Cloud Nine started up and I was captivated. This album is sweet. Major highlights is \\"Devil`s Radio, I got my mind set on you, Just for today, Cloud Nine, When we was fab and This is love\\". That is my oppinion though, but other listeners will surely fall for some of these. Lynne`s sound shines clearly through, but this helps the album get that special poprock sound. It is a great album, and it beats Paul McCartney`s solo-albums with miles, and very many others too!
B00005K3OT|4.0|Juliette Binoche  make the moive  so good i like her and in this film she was great  , also when she make the chocolat in the film that make you wanna test it , with a good cast in the film so all together will give you a  nice moive i hope you injon it
B0000248L1|5.0|Well, this album is a classic example that makes one wonder why some bands (or artists) manage to achieve enduring stardom and others simply don't. ALICE IN HELL is better than anything Metallica ever released, for example. (except for the vocals - but they fit the music here). Maybe that's because trash's heyday was already past in 1989, when ALICE IN HELL was released...<br />Great album, all the tracks are special. And NEVER NEVERLAND would soon come...
B000069CWE|3.0|For those expecting something new, wait for their next CD.  For those who want to hear Hybrid Theory again (only rapped up a whole lot), this is the CD for you.  For those who have taken their SAT's, the original Hybrid Theory is to a decked out Pontiac TransAM like Reanimation is to a Low-ridin' Caddy.  Subwoofer preferred. Enjoy.
B00000612P|5.0|FIVE STAR is the only plausible rating to give this masterpiece. Now, 31 years later after its original release, it has lost none of its appeal, its atmosphere, its fascinating texture, its sublime inspiration. Rod, Ron Wood and his pals made history here! I just love the album!!
6305558167|4.0|You probably know the story of King Arthur & the Round Table already. So...<br />Though I've read a lot of movie reviews that pick upon this film, I love the themes it portrays - especially the flawed hero. Even King Arthur has his faults.<br />I've loved this film from the moment I saw it on the big screen.<br />Filmed in Ireland it is a wonderful visual feast accompanied by a great score. John Boorman's use of classical pieces, such as Carmina Burana would make you think that they were written especially for this film (as in John Boorman's earlier work - Zardoz).<br />It features many faces then not well known; Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren, and Gabriel Byrne, as well as lessor known stars Nigel Terry & Cherrie Lunghi as the king & queen.
B000002H6C|5.0|I have owned this record for about 7 years, and it still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When I first listened to it, I hated it. I have no idea why. I put it away for a few days and went back and gave it another spin. From then on, I've been a changed person. It didn't alter my life beyond recognition, but if I had never heard this record, I dont't know what would have happened to me from a musical taste standpoint. I could have ended up listening to Dave Matthews or Phish, or some other awful band. If for some ungodly reason you do not own this record, either order it right now, or head to Karma and get it.
B000069CWE|3.0|Ok look, i found out Linkin Park made a  new cd the smae day i got it. Well just becasue a band makes an awsome first cd doesnt mean it will happen again. The djs were cool and stuff but i want the old style Linkin Park not a Rap cd. The cd is ok, but if your into rock dont buy this becasue you might be disapointed.  dude all you rock fans out there that want a new rock cd get Disterbed's coming soon. Peace
B000068PQ0|5.0|Flaming Lips are a band that have been overhyped in the past.  Now they more than live up to it.  THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM OF 2002.  IT WILL BE HARD TO ECLIPSE IT.  <br />The band's  last normal record, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; was incredible.  &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot; ups the stakes  The result.  The best record of the year.  Even eclipses the Super Furry Animals brilliant album and leaves fellow soulmates Mercury Rev in the dust.  Even Radiohead will be shaking there collective quirky little heads.  <br />They have finally done it.  An Orch pop masterpiece.  Quirky as hell.  Won't get any radioplay.  But I have a feeling I will still be listening to this record 20 years from now.  <br />And in closing, I am beginning to believe &quot;Do You Realize&quot; is also the single of the year.  What a stunning beautiful song. <BR>end<BR>kdc

0784011796|4.0|12:05 AM, began writing review for Pi, an amazing film by Darren Aronofsky.<br />Mathematician Max Cohen is obsessively trying to find a pattern for the way the stock market rises and falls. He bases these on his three fundamental assumptions: 1) Mathematics is the language of nature. 2) Everything around us can be represented and understood by numbers. 3) If you graph the number of any system, patterns emerge. Therefore, there are patterns everwhere in nature.<br />502884197169399375105820974944E<br />He's a mathematical supergenius but a severe misanthrope and so introverted, he makes me look like Bill Clinton. He's very disconnected with society and spends time around the clock on his problem, helped by a regimen of pills. His computer setup is a muddled patchwork system that is a reflection of the chaos and disorder of his mind. He finds solace visiting his old mentor Sol Robeson, with whom he plays go.<br />592307816406286208998628034825E<br />Sol's pearls of wisdom are lost on Max. Sol sees the world as chaotic, without any order. He explains the go board as a microcosm of the universe, where an infinite number of reflects a complex and chaotic universe. His parable of Archimedes (Eureka!) is also lost on Max. Ever the voice of reason, Sol tells Max there's more to life than mathematics and to take some time off, to take a bath like Archimedes.<br />342117067982148086513282306647E<br />A group of agents want him to figure out the pattern to the stock market but he refuses them, turned off by their representative's persistent and pushy approach. At first, anyway.<br />Max also meets the more extraverted Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew who's also into math theory, but using the Torah as his data set. The dual use of the Hebrew alphabet as numbers and sums was a fascinating thing I never knew about.<br />093844609550582231725359408128E<br />When Max's computer crashes, it spits out a long digit that may be a similar digit that caused Sol's computer to crash back when he was calculating pi. When Lenny mentions a 216 digit word that may hold the key to his search, Max teams up with him.<br />481117450284102701938521105559E<br />References to the Golden Spiral and ratio of the rectangles by Pythagoras, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Fibonacci sequence will be of delight to scientific-minded. For those who don't know the Fibonacci, start with 1 and 1. The sum of the first two numbers equals the third, resulting in 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,56, etc. The ratio theta, which is the quotient of two numbers in the series, reaches 1.6180339887499, for anyone interested. Take a rectangle with a ratio of that to 1. Make that rectangle a square and the remaining smaller rectangle has that same ratio theta. Cool?<br />644622948954930381964428810975E<br />This b&w independent wonder by Darren Aronofsky is full of swimmingly dizzying shots to emulate the chaos of the city and in Max's mind. Bizarre imagery also comes into play, such as the mystery man with the bleeding hand, the brain, and his visions and dreams. This movie seeks to create a common ground between rational science and religious mysticism, as represented by Max and Lenny. There's also the opposing viewpoints of an ordered universe (Max) of patterns versus chaos (Sol). Top honors go to Sean Gullette (Max), Mark Margolis (Sol), and Ben Shenkman (Lenny). So, why call the movie Pi? Because pi is a decimal that's irrational, nonterminating, nonrepeating, just like a go game.<br />12:30 AM, finished writing review for 3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510 5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825 3421170679 8214808651 3282306647 0938446095 5058223172Ewhen he was calculating pi.

B000006CCG|4.0|W.A.S.P. were a fairly decent band, who, among other good things, [angered]Tipper GOre and all the Washington Wives in the PMRC.  This album features some decent guitar work from Chris Holmes, who describes himself as a piece of ..., and as a bonus, has a cover of the song \\"Paint It Black\\", a b side, and their first single, which members of the PMRC hated to refer to by name, \\"ANIMAL: F**K LIKE A BEAST\\".  Worth buying, especially for Animal, I wanna be somebody, the Flame, and Love Machine.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Charismatic Vin Diesel leaps to the top of the action heap portraying a new kind of hero:  a no-nonsense daredevil of a &quot;streetracer&quot; who's &quot;Fast&quot; with the ladies and &quot;Furious&quot; with those who cross him, (hence the movie's title). Diesel oozes testosterone in every frame of this high-powered, thinking man's action pic that's sure to delight road scholars and the follically challenged.
0553103547|5.0|This book is something out of the ordinary.  Instead of good against evil, (stereo type fantasy) It gives you the charecters and lets you try to figure out who you should trust and who you shouldn't.<br />The two main families are: The Starks who live in the far north and are very harsh, and the Baratheons who rule the kingdom.  It begins with the some of the Stark family traveling south with the Kings company and the rest of the Starks staying back at their castle, Winterfell. but before you know it evryone has dispersed off in differant directions and well... the plot thickens.  You also can't foreget Daenerys, she and her brother are the last survivors of the old bloodline the Targaryens.  Banished arcross the water they are angry, for they want the throne that is theirs by right...<br />And as everyone competes in the game of thrones you never know who will come out dead or alive.

B00001QEE7|5.0|I was born in 1987, making me two years old when Disney released The Little Mermaid. I can't remember, but it seems like this movie must have defined my youngest moments. I had a cassette tape story version memorized by age three and knew every word to every song as soon as I owned the VHS version. <BR>Well, I still love The Little Mermaid. In my opinion it is one of the five best-animated children's movies ever made. The characters are fun, fresh and wholesome, the songs are great and the story is meaningful. <BR>To me, Ariel's intense desire to see the world and live as a human is fabulously displayed in &quot;Part of that World&quot;, a song, which will always hold a place in my heart. Her passion and longing is so real, to me it is half the movie. <BR>This is not an artificial and frilly children's carousel ride, which lacks both plot and purpose. It's emotional, evocative and memorable. Every little girl should see The Little Mermaid. <BR>The ending makes me cry, every time as does the &quot;Part of Your World&quot; reprise. <BR>Do yourself a favor and buy this inarguably magnificent movie.
B0000028VT|3.0|Mariah Carey's MUSIC BOX seemed to be an attempt, ever-so-slight though it may have been, by the singer to branch out a little from the slick pop sound of her first two records. To that end, she throws out a little hip-hop lite in the form of first single 'Dreamlover', which still has its' charms, as well as the Clivilles/Cole house throwdown 'Now That I Know'. Those two remain the album's best moments--the rest is filled out by her trademark greeting-card sentiment balladry which, with titles like 'Never Forget You' and 'All I've Ever Wanted', all sound either pretty or dull, or more often that not, both. This remains her most ballad-heavy and,ultimately, neglible release(next to the equally dull BUTTERFLY).
B00005QFE5|4.0|I can't give this movie 5 stars; they simply didn't rake the characters through the coals enough, which is the sine qua non of any good romance film.  All she really does is sit around and wait.  I kept waiting for the twist.<br />Compare the furnaces that the characters in such movies as Unbearable Lightness of Being and The English Patient have to go through, and I think you'll agree that one reason this film stops short of really MOVING you is that their love was a tame and low-risk venture to start with.  There doesn't really seem to be anything at stake.<br />Another problem is that the girl's love for the man was, er, superficial.  She fell in love with him because he was a handsome teacher who came to her village, and that's it!  Sheesh.  They don't really share anything, and it's not like he does or says anything special to win her heart.  In fact he can't even remember about her blue bowl.  The reason this is a problem for me is that seeing a childish, superficial love blossom into fruition is pleasant but somehow unsatisfying.<br />Absolutely stunning photography, though.  Don't waste your time with a fullscreen edition (if one is even available).<br />Let me add that the main character is a babe and a half!  If the movie was just two hours of her face, I would still have given it three stars.
B000002AVF|5.0|Though all of Mariah Carey's three previous studio albums had their moments, she finally got it right start to finish(for the most part)with DAYDREAM.  Starting big with her best uptempo single ever('Fantasy'), DAYDREAM finds Carey beginning her infatuation with hip-hop and R&amp;B, which she incorporates here far more than on any of her previous records, and for the most part it works pretty well.  Though she's still prone to sappy balladeering and vocal excess(witness 'Open Arms' and 'One Sweet Day'), this is the first album that saw her actually attempting to reign in her vocal acrobatics, and while this often resulted in somewhat muddled, incomprehensible singing, she at least acknowledged that sometimes less is more.  Besides 'Fantasy',<br />highlights here include 'Underneath The Stars', 'Always Be My Baby' and 'Forever'.  Without a doubt, DAYDREAM remains  Carey's most essential studio recording.
6301777387|1.0|I Am A BIG fan of MASH, but I was very unhappy with the Quality of MASH  the first season  on VHS. DO NOT BUY IT. The DVD version is more than worth it , and I stongly recommend it.
6305265666|4.0|Yes, I sure was surprised to like and even be somewhat charmed by this retelling of the Cinderella story starring Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston. I had been dragged off to the theatre by a friend--just being obliging, you know.<br />Well, Drew Barrymore does a very good job as the more than slightly feminist Cinderella character, and Huston gives us a wickedly nasty stepmother. Interpolation of Leonardo Da Vinci into the film as a pseudo godmother works surprisingly well.<br />Looking for some romantic escapism? Then turn to &quot;Ever After&quot; and have a delightful time.
0060005424|4.0|Number one, I refuse to be called one of the \\"potter\\" crowd (in a previous post)... I liked the books, but I liked Sabriel just as much, if not more so! I gave Lirael 4/5 because I think Sabriel deserves 5/5, and the sequal doesn't quite match up. The fact that it had a hanging ending didn't bother me (get over it people, that's standard book practice... at least it mentioned a sequel!) What did was the lack in mention of Sabriel and Touchstone. I just can't belive that they'd go off to Ancelstierre and leave the Old Kingdom to fend for it's self. The purpouse it serves is simply to give the new charactures some space to grow, but I personally would have liked to hear more of the old charactures, who are still by far my favorite! Oh well, at least Mogget was still around, if only in a sleapy state!:P I guess I can always hope that the next book will have more of my favorite Abhorsen!
B000002MFN|5.0|In October of 1992, Madonna had released her eigth album entitled, EROTICA. This album was the start of many wild antics Madonna would go on to take. Before the release of this album, Madonna released her extremely shockingly sexual pictorial book entitled, SEX. But that was just the beginning of it all. This album was the next step in her sexual antics. Actually, this album only features three songs that talk about SEX, where the rest of the album is pretty normal. This album was overlooked and underrated. This album deserved much more attention and respect than it had gotten. This is a great album and I'll explain why. <br /> <br />EROTICA <br />  The first single from the album. This song is, indeed, very dark and sexual. In the video, Madonna is dressed up as her sexually hungered S&M Dominatrix SEX Book character, DITA. The video even shows some of the photos shoots from the SEX Book shoot. The video features many celebrities that are featured in the book, including Tony Ward (Madonna's boyfriend from 1990-1991), Vanilla Ica, Big Daddy Kane, Naomi Campbell, Isabella Rossalini, etc. But this is a great song here. Madonna has performed this on her CONFESSIONS TOUR. But she added a twist: She put \\"Erotica\\" in a medley with a song entitled, \\"You Thrill Me\\". \\"You Thrill Me\\" is actually the demo version of \\"Erotica\\". In this performance, Madonna goes back and forth between both songs choruses. <br /> <br />FEVER <br />  The fourth single from the album. A great rendition of the Peggy Lee classic. Frankly, I think Madonna's version blows Peggy Lee's rendition right out of the water. The video version is slightly different, but this song is still a Madonna classic, complete with a dazzling music video. <br /> <br />BYE BYE BABY <br />  The sixth & final single from the album. This single, which is a Non-U.S. single (released in Australia and some parts of the U.K.) is another classic song.  <br /> <br />DEEPER AND DEEPER <br />  The second single from the album. This is one hell of Latin-fused disco tune. Great dancing tune. <br /> <br />WHERE LIFE BEGINS <br />  This is not one of my favorites, and it is the second tune to be talking about sex. <br /> <br />BAD GIRL <br />  The third single from the album. A great song. The music video is one of my favorite Madonna videos. It is not dazzling, but the concept is what makes the video one of my favorite Madonna videos. In the video, Christopher Walkin plays some sort of Guardian Angel, hovering over a crime scene, where Madonna's character in the video was killed. He takes out his watch and winds all the way back to find out how she was killed. Madonna plays a chain-smoking, unhappy, sex hungry, business woman, who goes home from work with a different guy. The last guy she ends up with is towards the end of the video. The song stops when the guy leaves the room for a second. Christopher Walkin appears and kisses Madonna, then leaves. As he leaves, the song starts up, and Madonna's gentlemen friend comes back, and then...well, you figure it out. <br /> <br />WAITING <br />  A great song. <br /> <br />THIEF OF HEARTS <br />  To all the women out there: you better keep your paws off of us guys because we may be dating Madonna. If she catches you with us, she will rip all of your throats out. I'm just kidding. But that joke is what this song is about. It's about Madonna dating a man, where her girlfriend tries to take him away from her. <br /> <br />WORDS <br />  A great song about how Madonna's boyfriend cuts her up badly with his harsh \\"Words\\". <br /> <br />RAIN <br />  The fifth single from the album. This is a beautiful ballad that is about Madonna's mother and Karen Carpenter (of The Carpenters). Madonna grew up listening to The Carpenters, so I think it was a nice touch for Madonna to dedicate this song, not only to her mother, but to Karen Carpenter as well, who passed away due to anorexia. <br /> <br />WHY'S IT SO HARD <br />  This song has a great message, asking why it has to be so hard to love one another. <br /> <br />IN THIS LIFE <br />  Madonna wrote and recorded this song for two friends of hers that had sadly passed away to AIDS. Madonna does, indeed, have a great heart. Many of you idiot critics can't see that because all you know how to do is try to find bad things about Madonna. But Madonna does have a great heart to write and record this beautiful song. <br /> <br />DID YOU DO IT? (Remix of \\"Waiting\\") (featuring Dave Murphy & Mark Goodman) <br />  This is a remix of waiting, with two rappers, by the names of Dave Murphy and Mark Goodman, rapping to the entire remix, with Madonna's pre-recorded ad-libing vocals in the chorus. Horrible remix. If ain't broke, doin't fix it. <br /> <br />SECRET GARDEN <br />  The last song about Sex. Not that great. <br /> <br />    Despite the fact of three songs not being able to fit my liking, this album is outstanding. The album was terribly overlooked and underrated. Maybe all of you fellow Madonna fans out there can give this album a chance and the respect it deserves.
B000069HKH|5.0|After listening to this CD, I can honestly say several of the songs brought tears to my eyes.  You'll need to sit down and listen 100% several times..follow in the song book to get every word.  Everyone headed for a concert should do this as required reading!

0783225970|5.0|I often wondered how it was that The Godfather has consistently managed to overshadow Scarface. Don't get me wrong, the Godfather series are excellent films that can only be described as gems in the genre, and are certainly as big a part of American cinema as classics like Citizen Kane and others. But while the Godfather series were an example of superior filmmaking and excellent dramatic examples of fine cinema, I always felt that Scarface painted a picture of a more believable life of a startup criminal - from the streets, to the pinnacle of power, then down - spiraling, crashing.<br />True, the timeline of Scarface is often a blur. And cinematically, it is probably below the polished gem that is The Godfather. But Scarface is a bit more believable and is not quite so &quot;dry&quot;, for the lack of a better term.<br />It is a tumultuous, and for its time, controversial film that shines time and time again at each viewing. And if history has taught us anything, it's that it's these kind of movies that will cling to one's mind and leave a lasting impression.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Not being a big McCartney fan since the time the Beatles broke up (never really got into &quot;Wings&quot;), I was pleasantly surprised with this album. It has overtones of old Beatles stuff in some ways, yet with an originality and uniqueness of its own.
B00000K31V|3.0|Welcome to the bizarre world of David Cronenberg, and a film in which he considers the implications of modern technology and where it's all taking us as a society-- a  contemplation of hypothetical possibilities that are at once unsettling and exciting.  It's \\"eXistenZ,\\" written and directed by Cronenberg; a mind-bender that will have you meeting yourself coming and going, and not knowing which is which before it's all over.  But that's the nature of the game, and there is, in fact, a very real possibility that you're actually not even reading this page right now-- I mean, how can you tell for certain?  And that gives you an idea of where this film is about to take you.<br />Video game maven and designer \\"extraordinaire\\" Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has created the ultimate virtual reality video game, eXistenZ (pronounced EGs-ah-stenz), and a control group has been assembled to test it out, with Allegra herself as the guide and game-master.  This is not your typical video game, however, not by a longshot; to play, in fact, the participants have to be fitted with a \\"bio-port,\\" which is implanted in the base of the spine, and into which the game is hooked up via a connection that looks like an umbilical cord.  The game module itself is like nothing you've ever seen, either.  A kind of erotic-looking latex affair on the outside, the components are actually organic in composition.  From all appearances, this is going to be one wild ride of game, which is exactly what Allegra and her company is promising.<br />The night of the test is ill-omened, however, in light of the fact that rival companies are out to either steal or stifle the realization of eXistenZ.  There have even been death threats, and an assassination attempt on Allegra's life at this juncture is clearly within the realm of possibility; and accordingly, a bodyguard, Ted Pikul (Jude Law) has been assigned to protect Allegra, and most importantly, the game-- the prototype of which is the only one inexistence.  And it is in Allegra's personal game module.  And so the festivities begin, with the promise of excitement that just may transcend even all that eXistenZ has to offer.<br />Reminiscent of a couple of his earlier films, \\"Videodrome\\" and \\"Scanners,\\" Cronenberg has crafted and delivered a thought provoking film, the message of which he presents (as he did with his aforementioned films) in fairly graphic terms.  He plants the seeds of disconcerting shadows in your imagination, then waters them with visual stimuli that encompasses myriad forms of all things creepy and crawly.  In addition, he weighs in heavily on the fear factor, relying on the effects blood, slime and things that ooze will have upon his audience.  And it's all very effective.  He sets a good pace and attempts to balance out story and F/X, but he does enjoy things that gurgle and spill out, and more often than not the F/X tend to take precedence over the story.  But this is Cronenberg's style, and it works well for him in most instances.<br />Having such a definite visual style, however, does not necessarily lend strength to character development, and Cronenberg (it would seem) relies upon the creativity and initiative of his actors to find the tone that will most effectively convey their respective characterizations most accurately and efficiently.  Essentially, the characters are a secondary consideration, if fact, so any depth that may have added considerably to the emotional involvement or impact of this film is absent.  Cronenberg is too intent on suggesting the effects of all of this on \\"people,\\" and as such, the individual gets lost in the shuffle of goo.<br />Given Cronenberg's priorities, it's no surprise then that the performances suffer somewhat from it.  Jennifer Jason Leigh looks terrific in this one, and she's certainly convincing to a point, but Cronenberg has written a one-note symphony, and that is precisely what he extracts from his actors-- nothing more and nothing less.  There's just not enough \\"shock value\\" to be derived from detail and nuance of portrayal, so Cronenberg simply doesn't bother with it.  Jude Law also succumbs to the maestros style of conducting, but he plays the note he's given as well as can be expected.<br />As Kiri Vinokur, Ian Holm's talents are wasted in a role better suited to the likes of Vincent Schiavelli or Dick Miller.  Furthermore, Shciavelli would have been perfect in the role of Gas, as well, which in the film is played convincingly enough by Willem Dafoe.  But again, for Cronenberg's needs it was a phone-in; certainly not a stretch, by any means, for Dafoe.  In fact, it would have been an interesting casting twist to have Schiavelli play both parts (and it would have saved on the budget-- two birds with one stone!).  Also slipping into the portrayal Straits of the Individual Lost are Sarah Polley (Merle) and Christopher Eccleston (Levi).<br />The supporting cast includes Don McKellar (Yevgeny), Callum Keith Rennie (Hugo), Oscar Hsu (Chinese Waiter) and Kris Lemche (Noel).  In retrospect, Cronenberg's film is something of a study in contradictions; while it has a concept that is intellectually stimulating, the presentation is designed for a target audience that will inherently lack the capacity or experience to appreciate the more profound aspects of it.  Interestingly enough, this same year (1999) the Wachowski Brothers explored similar territory, thematically, in the resoundingly successful \\"The Matrix,\\" which not only has superior F/X, but pays close attention to characterization, through which a sense of autonomy-- even among the masses-- emerges effectively.  And it is precisely that lack of consideration of the individual human element that makes \\"eXistenZ\\" less than satisfying.  Cronenberg has a terrific idea here, at the heart of which is a cautionary tale with a significant moral; and it's a shame that that is not the film he made.  Instead, he delivers a film that is entertaining on a very base and basic level, but which, in the final analysis, limits itself unnecessarily.
B000065V3M|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies. It is a must have! Filmed in glorious black and white, it's so &quot;film noir.&quot; This is the kind of movie that mainstream America, just wouldn't get. Fabulously directed by no less, Mr. Tim Burton. Campy humor, Bill Murray being the &quot;drama queen&quot; with classic one liners like, &quot;Oh what does that old queen know?&quot; There are so many wonderful things in this movie that it's unbelievable. Also, the soundtrack is fantastic. The movie is not boring for one minute. It's just one of those movies that you just have to own. I'm even going to buy this movie when it's released on DVD. Place your order today, it will not disappoint you, there was even a scene where I cried a bit. You just gotta have this movie. WAIT, PULL THE STRING, PULL THE STRING!
6302787556|5.0|I saw Malcolm X when it first came out in the theaters a long while back. I loved it soooo much I bought the tape and watched at least 20 times over and plan to watch it more than that. The story is about the life of the great civil rights leader Malcolm X. We see him at his most low, as a common criminal, his rise thru the Nation Of Islam, and his spiritual evolution which takes him even beyond Elijah Mohammed. This was and still is Spike Lee's best film yet. And I don't care what a lot people, especially those at Motion Picture Academy thinks, Denzel Washington should have won the Best Actor award for this film and Spike Lee should have won Best screenpaly, best director, and best movie and every other \\"best award\\" that he should have as the director of this film.
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is contains amazing, energetic, addictive, innovate pure funk rock.  Adam Levine's golden vocals shine through with a subtle, but distinct sounds of the supporting instrumentals.  The lyrics are smooth and catchy, and at several moments throughout the album, the combination of all these come together as a &quot;perfection of her creation&quot;, to quote one lyric, it just makes you tingle.  The magic of Maroon 5 truly comes out when they perform live.  It appears that it is the greatest time of their lives and they want it to be the greatest time of yours as well - and what made this cd even more amazing was that I couldn't wait to hear these songs live - they beg to be sung along to and swooned over.  Their sound is like nothing else out there - so go buy this cd yes - but absolutely run, don't walk to their next live show.   They'll make you tingle too.
B000050IE6|5.0|I have developed a love melodic metal and thrash, it all started a couple of years ago with master of puppets. In the last half year i have discorvered opeth and im still in the collecting process of there 5 wonderful cds. Anyway my latest aquisition is still life. After several times listening to it all the way through, each time i am amazed by its complete genius. <br />Mikael the lead singer is just an incredible musician, i strive to be like him. The lyrics follow a story which i think is a cool concept. Also on vocals is a sharp contrast between a dark growl and an amazing traditonal singing voice. On guitars there is a lot of wicked riffs, and lovely accoustic pieces. The drums range in intensity from a kinda jazzy feel too pounding metal drums. <br />In short this album is incredible. Its epic and has tons of variety. Any musican could appreciate the work, and many will fall in love with it as i have.  Buy it and listen and enjoy.
B00006690G|5.0|Marshall Mathers is the first pop-music genius of the 21st century.  Ever since \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", this exhibitionist with a heart of gold has been carving out his own artistic territory - a kaleidoscopic synthesis of music, poetry, suffering, bad potty training, bad relationships, and above all, theater.  In the context of the stage show - look at the cover:  MM on stage in front of a closed curtain; now you see him, now you don't - this album is an a report from the field, so to speak, of the evolving Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers/Eminem personna, which is, after all, the slippery subject of all the art (is it enough to call it music?). So if you're new, don't start here.<br />\\"The Eminem Show\\" is a public pause, an opportunity the artist has taken to contemplate, confess, and comment on life-to-date.  One of the things that makes this line so compelling is that he is one very, very smart boy, and so his confessions and comments are very, very interesting.<br />His intelligence allows him create, within the context of performance, the illusion of intimacy.  By \\"illusion,\\" I don't mean he's dishonest.  On the contrary.  Masks make shy people bold. I believe him, whether it's about his industry, his mother, his lawsuits, or how crazy he is about his daughter.  But this is, as the title tells us, a show. The reason it works is that it is so clearly the product of an open heart.<br />One of the other most noteworthy things about the album is that it is more musically ambitious than the first two.  The tracks are still lyric-driven, but MM seems to be honing his own musical voice, and that means that his music is becoming distinguishable from the cookie-cutter gansta rap that has been, for him, merely a diving board.  This seems consistent with his first two albums, each of which was an innovation from everything that had come before it - whether in \\"rap\\" \\"pop\\" or whatever.
B000069HKH|5.0|Maybe she was a secretary working on the 109th floor of the WTC.  Or maybe her husband was a firefighter who lost his life, or perhaps her neighbor was that firefighter.  With this album, Bruce Springsteen fuses all his artistic strains into one grand synthesis:<br />-- The storyteller of north Jersey, the Faulkner-like chronicler of the young, fast, and crazy as they grew into working class, disillusioned, troubled adults.<br />-- The romantic poet aching to find love and connection<br />-- The social critic<br />All of these strains come into play here.  He is talking to you at all these levels, and doing it for the most part seamlessly.<br />Okay, that covers the words. What about the music? Does it ever rock, on the tunes where you really want it to take off and rock.  The new producer, Brendan O'Brien mixes up the vocals, guitars and drum, and mixes down the Roy Bittan piano triplets that had become such a cliche.  The sound is leaner, more immediate.  There are fascinating little touches that only an imaginative outside producer would think of.  The music does not sound exactly like anything else Springsteen's done, but the soul has not been tampered with.  It is a Jersey seaside houserocking album, but with all this depth that is so soothing and healing, not just to the traumatized Americans in the wake of 9/11, but soothing and healing to anyone who's had a loss.  Bruce gets it.  This is a great album, don't be scared by the hype, it is everything your friends are saying and more.
B000069CWE|4.0|This CD is incredibly awesome. I'll admit - some of the songs I didn't like, but the case art and the good songs make up for the bad songs. My favorite track is the remix of \\"Crawling.\\" It's amazing. Even if you don't like a few tracks, the good tracks are worth the money!
B00005JL3A|5.0|Although there were no characters from the actual game in the movie there were quite a few things that fans will be able to immediately notice.  Certain scenes are recognizable and the graphics and fx kick ... .  The movie itself actually takes place before the first game and ends around the time Resident Evil 2 ends and 3 begins. ... Only thing bad about it is there are no deleted scenes available to watch.  Definately buy this movie and you won't regret it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Oh sure, I've seen these videos there AWESOME! They were on HBO last year. I also downloaded them off the internet, can't get enough of them. Really excellent war movie, kind of like Saving Private Ryan meets Kelly's Hereos. Get and watchem over and over.

B000069HKH|5.0|What happens when in pursuit of the elusive Promised Land the wanderers are broadsided by the anger, destructiveness and anguish of 9/11? The Boss' apt response: a phenomenal 75-minute, 15 track Springsteen opus titled \\"The Rising.\\" The E-Street Band brings every bit of their age and maturity as individuals and performers to bear. The production transports their sound forward to 2002, yet gladly renders, throughout, warmly familiar sounds dating back to 1973.<br />Bruce has never been one, in his writing, to run from the pain of life or, on the other hand, glorify suffering or blue-collar martyrdom. Instead, as typified on this album, he brings the myriad of emotions of all our journeys to bear, particularly as we live in the shadow of that fateful day. The record is filled with empty beds, missing heroes, aimless pursuits of utopia, yet recovers with the heavenly thought of gathering with good friends, late in the evening, at \\"Mary's Place.\\" This track will, by the way, be inducted into classic, E-Street Band repertoire forevermore.<br />The following track, \\"You're Missing\\", brings us musically back to the Bruce of \\"Darkness On the Edge of Town,\\" (voice and all) but with a reality far starker than getting up early and going to work. This track and several others successfully attempt to place the listener in the swirl of everlasting experience of 9/11, representative of both the living and the gone. For the destitute survivor of \\"Countin' On A Miracle,\\" there is no more youthful chase of the Promised Land, only memories of a lost lover. Yet for this survivor, those memories, and what they contain, will suffice until some other reason to hope comes along.<br />Even in its most upbeat moments, as in \\"Waiting On A Sunny Day,\\" the narrator sounds desperate and a bit skeptical, even as he attempts to keep his head high.<br />In the end, thematically, one is left with the towering notion that what sustains is faith in love and life sprouting from the ashes. The crescendo, the title track, suggests that a resurgence of faith can be found on the heels of those who, out of love, sacrificed their very lives to save others. As the saying goes: \\"You can kill the body, but you can't kill the soul.\\"<br />You will find, though, that while one tragic day is clearly the impetus for most of the stories, the themes are timeless.<br />The Rising is a groundbreaking Bruce album, through and through...do, the title track, suggests that a resurgence of faith can be found on the heels of those who, out of love, sacrificed their very lives to save others.

B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is one of my favorite artists.  The album is a 'wonderland' filled with wonderful songs.  Each is different and beautiful.  The guitar work is amazing.  A good album all around.
B0000683DH|5.0|If you're a Star Trek fan, you're probably familiar with the Even Number rule. That Trek films with even numbers (II, IV, VI and First Contact) are better than the odd-numbered films. Well, I don't think the quality of the film has anything to do with the numbering.<br />  This movie has things that few other Trek films do. First, a great villain. Khan is smart, deadly and insane. He's a superbly threatening foe. Kirk has to work hard to defeat him, and even then there's a terrible price to pay.<br />  The first Star Trek film ended with the line \\"The Human Adventure is just beginning.\\" And this is the most human of the Trek films. Kirk has to come to terms with his age, his past mistakes and death. There's a very strong focus on the characters. And the Spock/McCoy banter has never been better.<br />  And with the terraforming Genesis device, there's a scientific element that's pretty interesting. Mind you, it's only a minor part of the film, but still it's always nice to see a bit of science in Trek.<br />  The Director's Edition DVD restores a few minutes of footage which doesn't hurt the film, but I think helps it more in theory than practice. I do like the added element of Preston being Scotty's nephew.<br />  As for extras, there's a philosophical commentary track by director Nicholas Meyer, a geeky text commentary by Mike Okuda, some great interviews about the making of the film (isn't Shatner a delightful egotist?), archival interviews, and a filler doc on some fans turned Trek novelists. All in all, a nice assortment of features.<br />  But the truly special feature is the film itself. The computers on the Enterprise might be dated, but otherwise, this film has aged very well.
6304698623|5.0|I enjoyed this movie SO much, and having seen it years ago I remember it still as a movie I want to share with my children now that I am a mother.  Sara is a beautiful (inside &amp; out), kind little girl and the values displayed in this movie are wonderful.  The visual effects are fabulous, as is the music.  In all, a great family film - very uplifting and touching.  I always cry at the end!  Can't say enough good things about this one.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Hedwig, a transsexual, is the lead singer for the band Hedwig and the Angry Inch and she got double-crossed by her former lover who is now a big time rock star. She is bitter, angry, vindictive, and ready to take on the past in order to settle old scores.  One outlet is her music and it takes shape in many different forms throughout the film.  However, her anger is hard to direct, since she cannot confront her targets. Hedwig's story is displayed through an abstract, surrealistic, and musical design that brings across the idea of Hedwig's problems in a multifaceted manner.  The result is a smart film that is a brilliant cinematic experience.
B000059XUO|5.0|\\"The Crow\\" is the one film of all time that I actually like more than the book it is based on. \\"The Crow\\" is based on a comic book written, drawn and created by James O'Barr. The Crow was an underground comic book made into a film. Brandon Lee did wonderful portraying the part of Erik Draven. The music most of all is the most \\"Crow like\\" music being jazz and blues. Besides the rock n' roll, the jazz and blues set the mood for the movie with the gothic atmosphere of graveyards, churches and the ghetto of Detriot. The movie is fresh and deserves an Oscar for its cinematagraphy and production designs. And most of all, what makes this movie good is how it is rated R. If it were PG-13, it would be terrible over terrible. The bad language and violence set the mood of a gritty ghetto and the tortured soul of the Crow. The brief nudity is just opinional.<br />\\"The Crow\\" is probably one of my most favorite movies of all time. I enjoyed it fullly and I hope you do too.
B000068QY7|5.0|Thank goodness for Oasis. In a popscape littered with talentless rappers, nu-metalheads and bubblegum poppers, the new release from Manchester's Fab Five rises so far above the competition, it's almost scary. Unlike ninety-percent of current artists, the Gallagher brothers(Liam pens three tunes here...) simply write great songs with unforgetable melodies. <br />While \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is a tad less consistent than 1995's  classic \\"What's the Story Morning Glory\\", it remains, nonetheless, one of the essential releases of 2002. The notorious swagger and attitude, practically an Oasis trademark, is back in full tilt on rocking numbers like Better Man and Force of Nature. Even more impressive is the band's willingness to turn down the volume and explore acoustic pop on Liam's Songbird and Noel's She is Love. Ripe with sensibility, sensitivity and more melody than you're likely to hear anywhere else, both tracks would sit nicely on the Beatles'\\"Rubber Soul\\". Sonically speaking, the spooky Lennon-esque Born on a Different Cloud is the set's most explosive track. Featuring Liam's finest vocal performance to date, the echo-shrouded Different Cloud is one of the best tracks the band has ever laid down. Simply spine-chilling. Finally, there's the climactic Stop Crying Your Heart Out, a soaring ballad which epitomizes what Oasis does best. Cut from the same mold as Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova, Stop Crying starts gently, then builds to a glorious finale complete with strings and an powerful sing along chorus. Simply put, Stop Crying Your Heart Out IS Oasis!<br />Overall, \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is a much welcome return to form by the World's Greatest Rock-n-Roll Band. Recent releases by talented bands like The Hives, The Shins and Swag indicate that, perhaps, a true rock-n-roll revival is underway. Rest assured though, so long as Oasis is around the genre will never die quietly. Long Live Rock!
6301966562|5.0|Of all the 80's movies that has been released on DVD, this one hasn't been yet. Warner Bros has the rights to this movie and hasn't given a thought. I'm quite sure there are thousands of movielovers who would love to have this movie on DVD. I am one of them. The plot is simple and sweet. A nerdy guy who falls for his beautiful upstairs neighbor but the problem is that his computer has the same taste in women. The movie soundtrack is superb compared to some modern movies these days. Hits like culture club \\"love is love\\" is perfectly blended into the movie theme. All in all, we WANT this movie on DVD!!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Little Miss Avril Lavigne is gonna go somewhere!  She has a great talent for writing songs and an even greater talent for singing them!  She has a great unique style and most of all she's not afraid to use it...to her advantage!
0780624890|5.0|\\"Blade\\" is one of my top favorite movies of all time! It's so cool, so awesome and the casting is great. Wesley Snipes is the best Blade who could ever be casted. He has the looks, the physique and the bad attitude for an anti-hero vampire hunter. Although the special effects really [are bad], the movie's greatest overlaps that part. The fighting is great, the acting is great and the story is wonderful. David Goyer who wrote \\"Blade\\" knows how to write a comic book movie and knows what heroes to write about. Blade never had his own comic book series when he first came out. He was just a supporting character in \\"Tomb of Dracula\\", which was a comic book in the '70s. What is also great about the movie is what it is rated: R...  The bad language, the gore and the violence are needed in a movie like this (not nudity, definately not nudity). <br />\\"Blade\\" is a must-see movie. In my opinion, better than any other comic book movie (besides Spider-Man).
B00003CXXS|4.0|First of all, the line \\"HEAR THAT!!??, its a (INSERT RANDOM OBJECT HERE)RUN!!\\" was used about every second. The whole movie in general is great accept for the end. The ending of the movie stinks. The navy comes and rescuse them. Nothing more to say. The charaters were alrgiht. Rent before you buy
B000066NW0|5.0|I like every song on this album.  It's kinda like Pop music which I don't really care for that much, except it has a little more of a rockin' sound to it.  Avril shows a wide range with her voice and her music.
B00004SC3M|3.0|An upststart, high stakes thief (Zeta-Jones) is taken in by a master of the perfect heist (Connery) and a May-December romance. This movie thrives on intricacies and unexpcted plot twists. Unless you are a veteran in the detective genre, this film will keep your eyes glued to the screen and your mind racing with possible outcomes. I recommend this movie for men and women and for those first \\"stay at home with a movie\\" dates. Include the Thomas Crown Affair and you are in for a sexy and intriguing evening.
0767817478|3.0|Ever since the first trailer for \\"Godzilla\\" came out in 1998, I was so excited about the movie. I got every Godzilla book in the bookshores, watched all the old movies and practically researched the timeless monster. I pre-ordered tickets for the movie, invited some of my friends to see it but... the movie wasn't what I expected. I actually never knew that Matthew Broderick would be in the movie nor did I know about Jean Reno. In my opinion, both actors suck and what's the deal with Broderick? Why would they cast him to play in this action movie? I have no clue. Jean Reno was cool but his part in the movie was useless. Instead of having a French guy, they should've had a Japanese guy since Godzilla does come from Japan. The romance in the movie is dumb since the girl isn't pretty at all and her acting bites! Godzilla looked cool but probably could've looked better. And that Godzilla first attackings with the fishman boats and that Japanese ship were corny. The fishing scene with that old man when Godzilla enters Manhattan was overly and greatly stupid since Godzilla is over twenty feet tall and that old man threw the hook five feet away from him. DUMB! What they should've laided down on a little was on the humor. Every line and scene had too much humor and I didn't even laugh. The ending is too much like \\"Jurassic Park\\" where our main characters are stuck in a building with Baby Godzillas. I personally think they should've had a thing where the Baby Godzillas actually get unleashed and start attacking the city. <br />Overall, \\"Godzilla\\" is cool, but in a stupid way. I just wish they could've gotten better directors, better writors and definately better actors!

B00000K19E|5.0|&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a classic. &quot;The Matrix&quot; revolutionied action film and will never be forgotten. This is the greatest film of all time.

B000063UR2|5.0|In my lifetime I've probably seen the U.S. version of Legend about 10 times on cable and always marveled at it. There is so much to love in this movie, but I never really connected with the story the way I have with this Director's Cut release. Like Dune, or many other movies of the time, the movie is very ambitious and beautiful to look at, but it failed to make a lasting impression on me. I think the major factor that changed my perception of Legend this time around was the addition of the original Jerry Goldsmith score. Music in a movie has the power to convey emotions and build tension, which in this case really helps to draw you in and make a stronger connection with the story. The original Tangerine Dream score wasn't bad, but I think it dated the film and gave a different feel to everything. Legend is a classic fairy tale, and it's better suited with Goldsmith's classical score. <br />There is much more character development throughout the movie, mainly in the beginning with Jack (Tom Cruise) and Princess Lily (Mia Sara). The end of the film is also extended, which adds more closure to the story for me. It's a classic fairy tale ending. These additions and the original score make for a more timeless film, which hopefully will be enjoyed for many years to come. In addition to the restored version, this two-disc set also has a commentary with Ridley Scott, in which he gives great insight into what he was trying to achive with this film, as well as a new documentary about the making of the film, containing interviews with several cast members, including Mia Sara, as well as director Ridley Scott and several other crew members. This set definitely makes it worth giving Legend a second look.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a rare delight.  The title character is a painfully shy loner who discovers a small box filled with a little boy's keepsakes.  She seeks the rightful owner of the box.  The charm of this film is that Amelie wants to perform her little miracles, hiding in the shadows, with no recognition for herself.  The characters in this piece are fascinating, each one reflecting back a facet of Amelie's personality.  In the end, Amelie's compassion ends up being her own salvation - and that is what makes the film so much of a joy to watch.  Hollywood has pretty much exchanged emotion and subtlety for rudeness, crudeness, and over processed digital special effects.  Like a good French wine, this motion picture is an experience to be savored - not devoured.  Amelie has a look and feel that stands out from anything I've seen in recent years.  So many modern films are filtered with a grayish or orange tint, which tricks the viewer's eye into thinking it is watching a stark, gritty documentary.  Steven Soderbergh seems to be the reigning master of this technique.  Amelie by contrast, with it's deep reds and fluorescent and forest greens accented by cobalt blues and electric yellows, transports you to a world full of magic and hope.  The effect is enchanting.<br />The DVD package is complete with commentaries and documentaries on the making of the film.  These added features make it clear that this film was carefully planned by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, much like \\"The Sixth Sense.\\"  Shots were storyboarded, set up, and orchestrated months in advance.  And any extra footage of Audrey Tautou is always welcome in my home.  A blend of the beauty and grace of Audrey Hepburn, the humor and physical skill of Charlie Chaplin, and the vulnerability of early Winona Ryder, and the sultry elegance of a sixties European model.   Her method of using her eyes, facial expression, and body language (relying less on verbal expression) to create a character is what helps makes Amelie transcend language barriers.<br />I was a little disappointed there wasn't a version with dubbed English, but after 15 minutes or so, I didn't even notice that I was reading subtitles.  There were more than quite a few belly laugh moments, and it became very apparent that this is one of those rare films that is so good it completely transcends culture, language - the universal message is \\"The good you do for others returns - especially when you don't expect it to.\\"  A French delicacy.  I just hope we get to sample more of Jeunet, Tautou, and the rest of this team's products soon.  Thanks, Miramax.
B00005UOXN|5.0|I remember going out to the Disco with my friends and dancing the night away to &quot;Mony Mony&quot; and &quot;Dancing with Myself&quot;. Those are great fun songs guaranteed to get your energy pumping. Put this CD in if you need to be energized. It is fun listening, and dancing,  to Billy Idol's greatest hits.
B000065U1N|4.0|I am not well-read in modern military techniques, nor have I read the \\"novelised\\" account of this battle by Mark Bowden, so I cannot speak to the veracity of the film.  To a layman, it is very realistic, portraying the chaos, fear, and courage of U.S. troops under fire in a situation wherein they do not control the initiative.  Black Hawk Down tells the story of one incident in the U.N.-sponsered intervention in Somalia in the early 1990's.  At that time, U.S. Rangers and Delta Force, along with regulars from a Pakistani mountain division, were attempting to keep the peace in war-torn Mogadishu.  To that end, the U.S. special forces attempted to arrest members of one warlord's inner circle with a daylight raid into the heart of Mogadishu.  Insertion by helicopter, along with a Hummer column in support, was the method of choice.  When two of the Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by rockets, the U.S. forces lost control of the situation, with too few assets in the hostile zone to control the perimeter of both crash sites and the prisoner extraction.  A firefight lasting the rest of the day and all the following night.<br />This film is very well organised.  It deservedly won an Oscar for Pietro Scalia's editting.  Ridley Scott shares much of the credit, as well, as he sets up the characters we accompany into battle, then clearly arranges the action such that we can follow exactly what is going on.  While the many of the soldiers are indistinguishable in the midst of the firefights, the setup is arranged such that we know which groups are involved (i.e. crash site 1, crash site 2, or the extraction team).  Authenticity is added by the use of actual U.S. Army chopper pilots and equipment, as well as actual Rangers trained in the insertion techniques (sliding down ropes from an airborn Black Hawk) used in the real battle.  The film is relentless in its action - it is so authentic and sustained that the viewer is actually exhausted at the end (much like the Normandy landings in Saving Private Ryan).  Unfortunately, I feel these sequences go on a bit long, such that the viewer becomes numbed to the action.  Finally, the soundtrack by the able Hans Zimmer, interspersed with pop music, is quite good, and captures the moods accurately.<br />Unfortunately, this DVD edition is very dissappointing.  There is only one extra - that of an extended trailer featurette.  This one is just as annoying as usual, basically hyping the movie while giving little inside information.  The only parts of interest are the short sections dealing with the actors in boot camp (those playing Rangers and Deltas attended a week of training at their respective real-life training facilities).  The theatrical trailer isn't even included!  So, while the sound and video quality are top-notch, as expected, there is no reason to buy this DVD over the cheaper VHS tape.
0452282152|5.0|This book will definately keep your interest. I couldn't put it down. It tells the story of The Girl with A Pearl Earing in Holland in 1660. The best thing about this book is that it was very easy to read. There was just enough information given to give you an idea of life in those times - but the book does not weight you down with historical facts. It keeps you interested by keeping the story moving - you keep wondering how it will end and where the girl will end up. It is a really good story.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This has got to be one of the best animated movies to come out for a few years.  Disney had me worried with all of the sequels (some of which were shoddy and Disney should not have resorted to that extreme hehe) but then out came Monsters, Inc.  I wandered into that movie by a chance date and came out so completely in love with it that I saw it another three times that week alone!<br />It's an incredibly cute movie about Monsters, Inc., a company that scares children and uses their screams to power the city.  Through the use of wonderful characters and a unique plot, you will start to feel the emotions that are portrayed on screen.  A must have for anyone with kids or any fan of Disney movies!
6303575617|2.0|I bought this video but ended up returning it.  It's not for a home workout but more a gym tutorial.  Plus it is not done in Cory's normal style. Sorry Cory...  If you are looking for some really good tapes by Cory, I highly recommend these three:  Cory Everson Get Hard - Arms and Shoulders; Cory Everson Get Hard - Abdominals and Glutes; Cory Everson's Total Workout.  I use these three tapes weekly and am sore after each workout.
B00005Q66T|3.0|Let's stick with GHV1.  The Immaculate Collection was a &quot;great&quot; collection of songs of Madonna's that were popular hits.  Greatest Hits Volume 2 showcases some recent &quot;hits&quot; (although calling them &quot;hits&quot; would be stretching the word a bit) along with some old &quot;favorites&quot;, but are they really hits and favorites?<br />This CD was a pretty big disappointment to me.  I'm a big fan of Madonna, past and present, but this album does not contain a decent amount of hits to be deemed a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.  Anyone who picked this up should return it for the Immaculate Collection and rock out :)
B000067JBN|3.0|It may be unfair, but a remake of a hit movie must always be compared to the original.  The 1960 original of THE TIME MACHINE was a deserved hit.  The 2002 version may be a treat for the eyes, but unfortunately, not for the brain.  Part of the problem is that Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H. G. Wells, directed the movie as if he were more entranced with dazzling special effects (and dazzling they are) than with bringing out a believable, fully fleshed series of characters.  In 1960, director George Pal wisely kept the focus squarely on the hero's adventures and why he helped the human Eloi.  In 2002, Simon Wells clearly loved the image of leaping, loping half-humans that he had seen in previous sci-fi movies.  The supporting cast in the age of the time traveler (David Pearce) did not do very much to point out his character.  His girlfiend Emma (Sienna Guillory) was in the film only to motivate him to build a time machine to alter the past to avoid her death. One would think that such a clumsy device would not be sufficient by itself to galvanize the time traveller.  In the original, Rod Taylor's scientific curiosity with time was quite sufficient a motivation.<BR>       The real hero of the movie is the special effects co-ordinator.  The images of one day melding into the next are memorable.  Further, the appearance of the Morlocks as a cross between man and fish stuns the senses.  Jeremy Irons disappoints as the Morlocks leader.  As Irons pontificates on the split between Eloi and Morlocks, the viewer can see under the pasty-white makeup and hear the Irons from DIE HARD III lecturing Bruce Willis on similar such claptrap.  Further, the ending, which I shall not divulge here, is an incomprehensible mess of weird logic unconnected to resulting effect.  What emerges by the end of the film is the growing realization that Simon Wells ought to have paid less attention to being different from his forebear and more attention to a director who knew how to weave a magical spell that would not get lost in the techo wizardry that passes for the cutting edge in computer special effects.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I did. Until I heard Size Isn't Everything, Still Waters, and most definitely, This Is Where I Came In. Their only problem is that they made a Chaplin like song, Technicolr Dreams, that makes no sense whatsoever. But songs like Sacred Trust and Loose Talk Costs Lives, noticably mostly Barry, are songs you'd never regret paying for. This Is Where I Came In and Wedding Day are two incredibly charming songs, in their own ways. Embrace and Deja Vu are two almost Robin Gibb singles. They both are also charming and show no flaws. Though I must admit that everything isn't perfect (other than the already mentioned Technicolor Dreams). In The Extra Mile, the voices aren't the best parts of this song, especially on high notes. Walking On Air is incredible and as for the other Maurice Gibb single, it sounds like a Closer Than Close follow-up, not that I don't like either of those songs. So after all these years, you'd think they would be retired by now or have their vocal and writing disabilities. But once you buy the cd, you'll see that your thoughts would be wrong, just like mine.
B0000640VO|5.0|Yes she is cute and she has a wonderful smile that will rock your world, but that's not the only reason you gotta love her. Because....yes she will stand on somewhere high and wondering how many people in the world are having orgasm. Yes, she will be recording some funky stuff and send to the glass man. Yes, she will revenge people who have been mean to herself or someone she likes. Yes, she will steal her father's gnome and send it along with someone who is traveling with picture updats :)). Yes she will cut and paste her neighbor's past husband's letter into a new one, then sent it to the neighbor as a lost letter found up in Mount Blanc. Yes, no matter she goes she will always notice the stone she likes for skipping it. And yes, she will hear Stalin telling her not to care about what the glass man told her.<br />There are so man things in this movie that will make you smile. My favorite parts were that she went to the photo booth with Zorro's uniform (she imagined it, too, while she revenged on the grocery shop owner for one-armed Lucien); and when Nino first went to the coffee shop while she stood behind and denying she was the Zorror girl and pass a piece of paper to him. Kind of remind me some childish love in young age. Well, I guess her childish (or genuine I should say) nature is the momentum of the movie and is what makes her so cute. I must applaud for Audrey Tautou. She did an incredible job being Amelie.<br />It's hard to end this comment because there are so much to say about, but I will just end it this way. Watching Amelie is just like reading Zola's story. While following Amelie through her daily life, we have all become herself in the end of film. I believe for people who love this movie, you will smile for at least a week.
B000002JAX|5.0|A friend of mine told me that he had heard this singer while listening to NPR.  I took a listen myself and just can't get enough!  I keep searching for more recordings but come up empty-handed.  &quot;Where are you, Ms. Peyroux?&quot; I introduced her to my Mom who also just can't believe her talent for musical phrasing.  Her voice is truly evocative and transports me to another time and place.  I've listened to the track, Dreamland over and over again and it almost hurts hearing that yearning in her voice.  I'd love to see her on stage.  Anyone know of any dates?

0060934913|3.0|Who knew that the life of a chef was so wild? For those of you who thought that you needed to be a rock 'n roll star to live like one, Anthony Bourdain's book should dispel you of this notion. Motley Crue has got nothing on this guy. He is at least as much of a degenerate as any one of them. I expect to see a \\"Behind the Groceries\\" special on him on the Food Network any day now.<br />This is not your typical behind-the-scenes expose of the restaurant business. Don't expect tales about improperly stored meat, or ticked off line cooks spitting in a customer's food. This is more of an autobiography, one that happens to be about someone whose entire life is consumed by the restaurant business. I spent a lot of time wondering whether this was really representative of what it's like to be a chef, or whether it was more representative of what it's like to be a junkie living in New York City who happens to make his living cooking food. I have to say, I was expecting significantly less sex than was contained in this book. Bourdain has plenty of very funny tales, but I'm not sure that they warrant 300 pages. After about the first 200, I felt like I had gotten the point: that the restaurant business is run by a bunch of borderline personalities who are at least as likely to spend tomorrow face down in a gutter as they are to show up to cook your steak. I did learn a lot about the day-to-day workings of the restaurant business, something I hadn't put a lot of thought into until now, but I'm still not entirely convinced that it's something I should care about.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I think this is the best superhero movie of all times.<BR>It has all the elements of a fantastic movie period!<BR>It has characterization. It has drama. It has action. It has adventure. It has a love story. It has a friendship story. It has a father/son story. It has heart. It has special effects. It makes you laugh. And yes, it makes you cry too. It makes you be in awe. It has everything I can ever want in a movie. <BR>Of all the movies I've seen in the last 20 years, I think this movie is the best movie in any category.<BR>This is truely a movie that I can watch 10 times a year on DVD!...
B000069HKH|5.0|I've been a follower of the Boss since the Wild &amp; Innocent days. This is his best work ever!  I even put it ahead of Born To Run and The River.  The music, lyrics, and production blend together better than anything he's ever done.  I've listened to The Rising everyday since it came out, and it keeps getting better!  Besides being a bookmark in time for all the emotions that we shared over 9/11, it's an incredible collection of great songs.  Moving, haunting songs, and timeless rockers!  Bruce's CD has made my summer!
0060934913|2.0|Some of the chapters actually provide what the book promises - a behind-the-scenes look at restaurant kitchens, but most of it is just the author desperately trying to convince his readers of what a rockstar he is. I read the chapters on the kitchens and skipped over all the other, even still I wouldn't really recommend it.
B000069CWE|4.0|This isn't bad for a remix cd, but keep in mind it is a remix cd. Just my opinion, but I think it would have been a better choice to put off the remix album until at least a third album. Some of the songs have been changed beyond recognition [enth e end] and other sound almost the same as the originals [pts of athrty]. Most of the tracks are good and this album is mainly the hip-hop version of Linkin Park. Favorites are [and i'm using normal spelling] : Crawling, Pushing Me Away, With You, Enth E ND [thought not as good as the original], One Step Closer, By Myself, My December, and Forgotten. The best and most unique song on this disc by far has to be KRWLING. Basically, the entire album leads up to this song, hence the opener and intermission. I also enjoy the way the entire album flows together and its obvious they put alot of time into it. There are problems though, such as the strange techno noises that sound almost like voices, and the backwards whispers, which make me think of subliminal messages. I don't know if LP would do that to their fans, but I hope they don't. My suggestion is to burn this off of a friend and wait to buy Linkin Park's sophomore effort. But if you ARE going to buy this, the packagiing is really nice, that might be worth paying for.
B00004X0ES|3.0|OK, I know this is supposed to be PUNK RAWK, but you're going to have to do better than this to get me to break out the wallet.<BR>First of all, this is not punk.  This is REM with too many latte grandes.  If you want punk, try Black Flag or Fear.  If you want something more modern, try Bad Religion, NOFX, or Pennywise.  [bad] vocals and twangy guitars do not a punk album make.<BR>Secondly, and I am speaking most specificly of the \\"Told You So\\" track, these guys sound so much like Elastica it's scary.  Did I mention they sound like Elastica?  I also can't tell them apart from The Vines.  Not good.<BR>The upshot is that they have some good, driving beats and decent lyrics, something you don't always get with mass produced psuedo-punk top 40 bands.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This definitely deserved the &quot;Best Soundtrack&quot; Oscar.  Howard Shore is a genius.  The music flows so evenly with the story that when you're watching the movie you hardly notice it, but standing alone it's wonderful too.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|I never liked this guy. He was never interesting. I thought he was less intelegent than his peers. As for the Movie...... I love Ron Howard but this one was a Dead film....    I watched it again:    This movie was alot better the second time. I guess you have to hate the main charicter to like him. I changed my star ratting from a 2 star to a 4.
1563523302|5.0|It all comes down to the fact that you can't spend all your money if you want to keep some.

0736041850|5.0|This book is for everyone who loves working out, bodybuilding or to maintain fitness and physique. This book is a science about muscles at work + an art because it shows you almost every exercise for each and every muscle or muscle group using superbly detailed illustrations labelled with the names of each and every muscle part. I learnt alot from this book. Can you believe that when my trainer (who is a professional bodybuilder) saw this book he asked me to order one for him, so im going to order a copy again. I recommend this book to everyone (beginners to pros) who wants to start working out, study each muscle or learn new exercises.
B0000042HV|5.0|To those of you like me, bred off the strictly diatonic classical and romantic periods, when melody and counterpoint were fitted nicely within keys, the twentieth century can be a frightening place.  I have a hard time making sense of atonal music (much of Bartok's quartets, for example).  But Shostakovich's quartets make sense to me, even though he sometimes wanders through the chromatic scales and forsakes a set key.  This package is a wonderful offer, and a good introduction to the composer's later work.  They are quite different from his early symphonies.  Much of the music is so emotive its palpable, and the emotions range from burlesque, to grotesque, to deeply wounded and plaintive.  I love the largo from quartet six, a surprisingly diatonic and elated quartet in comparison with the others.<BR>When you get this set, wander off by yourself for a day and listen to each quartet.  I can't guarantee you'll like them all, but I hope you have the sense to appreciate these for what they are.<br />I can't compare this to the Emerson quartet's package, as I have not heard it, but the sound here is crisp.  I certainly can't tell that it's twenty-years old.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a book that should be read by anyone who has ever lost a loved one, by anyone who needs cheering up. True, the story is about murder and death, but the novel itself is so uplifting that you end up feeling rejuvenated once you finish reading it. It is the kind of novel that you want to take your time reading because you just do not want it to end. Quite simply put, The Lovely Bones is a pure gem, a rare literary work that will appeal to all readers. <br />Susie is a young teenage girl who thinks she has a bright future in front of her. Unfortunately, her life is cut short when she is brutally murdered by one of her neighbours. Death comes to take her away and she finds herself in heaven. From there, she looks down on her family and loved ones and witnesses how much her death affects their lives.<br />She looks down on her parents, who's relationship deteriorates after her murder. She looks down on her younger sister and brother, who both misses her in their own ways, but who both also have to compete with her death for attention. She looks down on her grandmother, a woman who wasn't all that much loved but who will find a new life for herself after the tragic incident. And she looks down on two friends from school, who will be forever changed by her death. And she also looks down on Harvey, the very man who murdered her and who may very well do it again. <br />As she sees these people grow and age, Susie narrates the story with a nostalgic grace that is always touching, never annoying. The story she narrates spans for over twenty years, a period during which many things will happen to these peoples' lives. <br />Alice Sebold created a story that is always touching, always emotionally striking and very entertaining. It is not a murder mystery. Nor is it a highly literary exploration on death. The story feels real, the characters feel real and Susie is one of the most interesting and memorable narrator ever put on the page. <br />The characters in this novel are in constant flux, always changing and evolving. So is the reader. This is the kind of book that changes you, that makes you feel better about yourself. It is the kind of book that will stay with you for a very long time. It is an unforgettable read, one of those rare novels that comes only once in a lifetime.

0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest of Jane Austen's work. The novel centres around the Bennet family, who are the principal inhabitants of the village of Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is a marriage obsessed mother, whose dearest wish is to see her five daughters married and settled. As it is, the Longbourn estate is entailed on a distant male cousin, for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet lack a male heir. This makes the five sisters, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, increasingly dependent on husbands to provide for them, if their father was to die. We see the different personalities of the five sisters, but the two that stand out are the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the novel, challenges and changes the established rules of class barriers. Her marriage to Mr. Darcy, an aristocrat who has an income of \\"ten thousand a year,\\" allows Elizabeth to climb the social ladder and cross social boundaries, despite the strictly stratified class lines of Austen's time. Elizabeth's eldest sister Jane, also makes an advantageous match with Mr. Bingley, a member of the noveau riche. Times were changing even as Jane Austen was writing. Although Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, lamented over her nephew's and Elizabeth's engagement, her angry objections were overruled. The ancient aristocratic voice became faint and was silenced as times changed.
0553062182|4.0|Have you ever felt overwhelmed and \\"jangled\\" by situations most other people seem to take in their stride? Have you often heard the words \\"Crybaby\\" or \\"You're just too sensitive about stuff?\\" Do strong smells, bright lights are loud noise seem to affect you more than they affect other people? Do you enjoy people and their company, but feel exhausted after you've been around them for a while? Do you intuitively see solutions to problems other people spend weeks solving? Do prescription drugs affect you more strongly than indicated? If you answered \\"yes\\" to any of these questions, then you owe it to yourself to read this book. When I first read it, I had a long string of \\"AHA moments\\" with each chapter, and I have since spoken to many others who have had similar experiences.<br />Dr. Elaine N. Aron's research on High Sensitivity in people is a welcome effort to show the world that \\"not being the same as the societal ideal\\" does NOT necessarily have to be labeled as a pathology. This is an important book that will resonate with the millions of people who have spent their lives feeling just a little out of step with the frenetic, aggresive, extraverted, hectic \\"do, do, do!\\" aspects of modern society.<br />The book starts with a Sensitivity self-test, to allow readers to evaluate their degree of sensitivity. The good news is that if the test shows that you ARE a \\"Highly Sensitive Person\\" there is nothing \\"wrong\\" with you, and Dr. Aron has done a laudable job of helping us understand WHY. High Sensitivity is a genetic biological state you have about as much control over as the size of your feet-- and it certainly isn't a personality \\"disorder\\" in need of \\"repair.\\" Throughout the book, Aron provides background to help readers understand more about their sensitivity, as well as tips and tools for how to improve the quality of their interaction with a world that isn't always tolerant of those who are a little \\"different.\\"<br />For some people, this book is a serious eyeopener-- especially those who might have been diagnosed with, and treated for, Social Phobia or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-- while feeling that the diagnosis really didn't seem \\"right.\\" Just the mere understanding of the characteristics of High Sensitivity could have a \\"healing effect\\" for them.<br />Anything I didn't like about this book? Well, stylistically, the writing is a bit dry and academic-- but then again, the book was not written for entertainment purposes.<br />A cautionary note: As with most self-help and self-analysis books, I would caution readers not to become TOO absorbed in pursuing the ideas presented in this book. As a long-time member of the \\"HSP Community\\" I have observed a number of people adopting their sensitivity as a \\"lifestyle\\" with a near-religious fervor, and a somewhat negative \\"Us vs. them\\" philosophy.

B000069HKH|4.0|No single musician, even one as talented as Bruce Springsteen, could ever  begin to make sense out of the World Trade Center/Pentagon bombings of 9/11/01. And to judge the success of this release by its ability to do so completely misses the point: Like the rest of us, Springsteen is simply trying to adjust to the post-9/11 world we're all living in today. The reality that life will NEVER be the same again is a lot to take in.<br />     The music here works most of the time, but why the new producer needs to use drum machines when he has one of the greatest rock drummers in the studio is beyond me! The topical songs (\\"My City Of Ruins,\\"The Rising\\", \\"Into The Fire\\") getting most of the press attention don't do much for me, but \\"World's Apart\\" and \\"Paradise\\", where the issues are examined from personal experiences,  add some humanity to some quite inhumane individuals. My favorite songs are the fast, upbeat ones(\\"Let's Be Friends,\\" \\"Further On Up The Road,\\" Meet Me At Mary's Place\\") simply because this is what Springsteen and the band has always done better than anyone else...
B000002U82|1.0|Wow - what a disappointment.  I grew up in the 60's and 70's, but I had forgotton how much of this pseudo-intellectual, banal artsy [stuff] there was out there.  This is  an album that the critics then and now believe was some type of a wonderful breakthrough album that was supposed to have lifted the level of rock music (or whatever) - actually it stinks.  If you are still lost in the 60's you'll love this - if you have matured somewhat in the meantime - it will seem like it goes on forever and ever with mindless nothing.  It has a couple average cuts on it - in reality - even in the early 70's - if this album had been cut by a less well known and less politically correct band it would never have seen the light of day.  Spend your money on something else.
B00003CX5P|4.0|It has to be said that Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace isn't as good as the recently released Attack of the Clones. Part 2 has more and better action, more impressive special effects and hardly any Jar Jar! But TPM does have some good points that make it an enjoyable entry into the franchise.<br />Pod races, spectacular CG, lightsaber battles and outer space carnage all combline to create a sense of fun in the biggest form. The FX throughout the film is impressive, with CG characters interacting with their human counterparts. John Williams' score for the film is brilliant, evoking the themes of the charcters and action with a bold, operatic approach which is familiar but welcome. George Lucas' visionary approach to the film creates a world rich in diversity and fascinating creatures. <br />The action is the film's strong point, and this one has enough fun action set pieces to compensate for the lack of good characters and the slow pacing. Liam Neeson is good as Qui- Gon Jinn, Obi Wan Kenobi's master, and Darth Maul is great as Sith Lord Darth Maul, despite his rather short screen time. But McGregor's Obi Wan is rather stale in comparison to the well-written charcters in A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. And Jar Jar Binks starts to grate after a while, although the character isn't as bad as some critics thought when the film was originally released.<br />But all that is missing the point completley. Star Wars isn't about acting, it's about the good old-fashioned story of good vs. evil, all done in spectacular fashion with lightsaber fights aplenty. And while it's below par compared to Atack of the Clones, it nontheless is a fun, action-filled entry into one of the most well-loved film franchises of all time. <br />The DVD's extra features are impressive, with a commentary from Lucas and the special effects team, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes, trailers and much, much more. The digital transfer is first-rate and the animated interactive menus are really imaginative. All put together in an impressive 2-Disc pack, this is one must-own DVD.
0375703764|5.0|Yes, the book is long, and parts of it can get boring. But if you read it a little at a time you will really start to appreciate the originality of it. The difference between this book and many other horror stories, is that you read this for the experience and not the story alone. Allow yourself to believe that &quot;The Editors&quot; and Johnny Truant, the man who claims to have written the book, exist and the footnotes will have more meaning. Read the apendices, the poems, and the letters. I think that if you take this book at face value- a basic story of a maze inside a house- it will not affect you in the same way as if you take in every piece of the story (storIES, I guess) and make it real for yourself.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|The most recent film translation of H.G Well's classic Science Fiction story is strong on visuals, yet lacks something in the character area. Director Simon Wells' take on the story will leave some purists saying &quot;Hey! Where's that thing?&quot; and &quot;Wait, isn't that just added for dramatic effect?&quot; And I myself can join those people, for while the somewhat wayward interpretation of the plot is entertaining, I would prefer a film that's more true to it's origins. There are some breath-taking visuals though, and Guy Pearce is good as the title character. The film's haunting score adds a lot to the most poignant moments, and there are some welcome thoughtful points about altering the past/future. What lets the film down is the aformentioned lack of closeness to the story and a slow mid-section. But it's great Sci Fi if you can look past it's flaws. Not perfect, but good fun.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Some people are just irreversibly jaded. I think our friend and fellow reviewer from Brooklyn who shall remain nameless is one of these people. This is a film that I will admit to not liking the very first time I viewed it. Upon my second viewing, I changed my opinion considerably. MOST people who praise dark and twisted movies do indeed like the decidedly dark and twisted. I loved both PI and Requiem and I really like this film. As far as Lynch's films are concerned, if you even dare to say Mulholland drive is any greater an achievement than this, your medication dosages are in great need of adjustment. This is a film. There is no need to classify anyone who likes or &quot;understands&quot; the film as nothing more than &quot;preppie&quot;(s) in search of coolness. Not enough people have seen this film to make it cool. It is so unbecoming to bash people in a review for no apparent reason whatsoever. Donnie Darko is a film that has a quality like others before it an hopefully many after it will have: it makes you think about it long after the end credits roll. Everything is open to interpretation, except blatantly harsh people who feel they have no choice but to alienate and look down on people who they disagree with. We will indeed get out of your house, it's a shame you don't leave it more often - it might do you some good.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Comic book adaptations are a mixed bunch, ranging from the excellent (Superman) to the excremental (Batman and Robin). And thankfully the latest superhero film is right up there with the greats. Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman, swinging around buildings, saving the world from Green Goblins and so on. His transformation from geeky Peter Parker to the ultra-cool Spidey is outstanding. Kirsten Dunst is good as his love interest. Throughout the film's running time, the action set pieces are well paced and inventive. The action is brilliantly done and thrilling, and the CGI blends seamlessly with the live action stunts. <br />Fans of the comic will not be disappointed, for the film stays true to it's origins, yet has enough adventure to make it new and attention-grabbing. Director Sam Raimi (the Evil Dead films) has created a world, which is fun and adventurous. There are problems; William Dafoe is limited in his performance as The Green Goblin, with the restraining suit creating a somewhat gauche characterisation. And Raimi sometimes goes a bit far with the retina-popping visuals. Regardless, it's first-class popcorn- munching entertainment, with enough action and FX to satisfy audiences.
B0000634EV|4.0|This has to be the BEST heavy metal CD I have heard in years.  I was wondering where HM was going, with all the rap-metal going on, along with the general attitude that metal will no longer sound like it did in the 80's (forgive me!), I was a bit lost.  <br />I 'tried' all the nu and rap metal bands, but they still kind of left me cold as far as the general 'feeling' I used to get from all that great mindless, party-oriented stuff from the 80's.  OK, time to get with the program - so I have, and have found that DOWN is where it is at.  The sum of their parts shine like the sun, as any of their individual parts have not been that hot over the past 5 years...(Pantera, COC, etc).  As some reviews say, guys you got to quit the day jobs and do more DOWN!<br />This is one awesome CD.  I have not heard DOWN's first CD, but if this is a disappointment, well the first must be a classic.  Either way, check this CD out - it will grow on you quickly.
0316666343|5.0|On the first page of \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" the incredible first novel by Alice Sebold, 14-year-old Susie Salmon reveals she was murdered. She describes her brutal rape and murder by a soft-spoken neighbor in harrowing detail. She continues to narrate the story from heaven, where she watches her family and friends cope with her death. <br />Susie's heaven is based on her memories and experiences and therefore resembles her hometown. She meets people who share her vision of heaven, like her roommate Holly. A former social worker, Franny, takes on the role of Susie's intake counselor. Susie spends her time gazing down on Earth from a gazebo, her favorite spot in heaven. <br />Susie's murder has shattered the innocence of her idyllic hometown. Susie's father becomes obsessed with catching her killer. Her parents' marriage crumbles when Susie's mother flees to California in an effort to escape her pain. Two of Susie's classmates, both social outcasts, bond over Susie's loss. As her friends and family react to the trauma, Susie tries to comfort them with her presence. Susie worries most about her younger sister, Lindsey, who is forced to grow up too fast in the wake of the tragedy. <br />Susie even watches her murderer, Mr. Harvey, a loner who has filled his basement with the corpses of stray animals. Harvey tries to control his violent urges by designing and building intricate doll houses. His unassuming nature is enough to fool the police, who in their gullibility dismiss him as a suspect. <br />Eventually, Susie begins to realize she has not gotten to heaven yet. She is stuck between heaven and Earth until she can come to terms with her own death. Franny tells her she will make the switch when she stops worrying about her family and friends and gives up on Earth. The task seems impossible to Susie. There are too many \\"whys\\" to answer, such as why she was killed instead of someone else. <br />The above description does not do justice to this imaginative novel which, in spite of the subject matter, does not stray into sensationalism or schmaltziness. The story aches with sorrow. In one scene, Susie's father retreats to his study where he examines ships in bottles he built with Susie. After smashing the bottles, he sees his daughter's face reflected on each piece of glass. Sebold's astonishing empathy for her characters reflects her personal experience with trauma. She was raped as a college freshman, an experience she explored in her memoir, \\"Lucky.\\"<br />In the midst of the sorrow and horror, hope permeates this story like oxygen. In spite of what has happened to her, Susie does not become bitter or lose her sense of humor. She manages to learn from the experience. The people who loved Susie move on with their lives. Ultimately, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is about how death severs the normal connections between people and how, through their grief, they manage to create new connections with each other.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a charming film from innovative French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children, Alien:Resurrection) starring a lovely doe-eyed Audrey Tautou.  In telling the tale of kindness and relationships, this movie has the unique look of Jeunet's other films (and uses many of the actors we've seen in his earlier work) with characters and situations that are more accessible.<br /><br />Special features include: a commentary track with Jeunet, in French or English; a featurette, 'The Look of Amelie'; outtakes; screen tests by Audrey Tautou (Amelie), Urbain Cancelier (the abusive greengrocer) and Yolande Moreau (the lovelorn concierge); Q&A sessions with Jeunet or with Jeunet and cast members; a storyboard comparison of the scene in which Amelie rides through the funhouse; an intimate chat with Jeunet, in which he describes the process of getting the film made, its snubbing at Cannes, and its subsequent commercial and critical success; 'Home Movies', inside the making of the film; French and American trailers and tv spots; a scrapbook; and cast and crew filmographies.<br /><br />I think Jeunet is the most interesting French director working today.  Amelie is visually dazzling and narratively both compelling and charming. The special features are plentiful and interesting, and make the dvd version worthwhile, particularly if you are interested in the work of this fine director.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0385335482|5.0|This book was great! The characters were so well writen, I felt as though I knew them.  I found myself relating and sympathising with the main character, Rebbeca. The comedy was great, but the author also knew when it was time to end the jokes and become more serious.  I cannot wait for the third book in the Shopaholic series to come out.
B00000JGHM|5.0|When the two giants Al Pacino &amp; Robert De Niro meet... it surely turns on the HEAT.<br />This movie is so perfect in every element that makes a movie so successful. But what I liked most was the meating between Al Pacino &amp; Robert De Niro for a cup of coffee... the conversation that took place between them is very touchy.<br />But there should be a special edition of this DVD. Because the current DVD lacks so many features... yes this movie deserves a better DVD edition.
B000063DIR|1.0|The rythm section that replaces the original is good, in time, but not an inch more than that. Just average good musicians.<br />The original band, with kerslake and Daisley played beautifully, originally. Buy the previous remaster, not this fraud.<br />The same happened with 'Blizard'. Ozzy is extremely greedy and cheap for doin this mess.
B000002KJQ|3.0|The remixing of this great album is atrocious. I bought Tres Hombres on cassette hoping that the remix was limited to the CD only. Much to my dismay, I was wrong. The same fake drums are to be found on the cassette tape as well. Please Warner, remaster this and the rest of ZZ Top's 70's albums and restore the original sound mixes!!! The echo and synthesized drums may have been cute in 1987 but are all but irrelevant and detract from the quality of the music today. <br />So many classic albums are getting the treatment they deserve with remastering for better sound quality and extras such as bonus tracks, liner notes and photos. Warner should really get with the program and reissue these great albums with proper remastering and restoration of the ORIGINAL sound mix. <br />As for the album itself, it's great. ZZ Top truly perfects their mix of rock and Texas blues. As good as Rio Grande Mud was, Tres Hombres is even better. It's a truly classic blues- rock album. Unfortunately other than the vinyl record, you won't be able to find the original mix. Soon, hopefully, Warner will FINALLY remaster Tres Hombres and all of Top's early albums.
B000069HKH|4.0|I was very surprised to like this record as much as I did. Not much activity from Springsteen has excited me since he gave up the E Street sound to write sentimental pop and, even worse, cheap-shot protest songs. On /The Ghost of Tom Joad/ he seemed to aspire to be Woody Guthrie, but his politicking in subsequent years reminds one more of Hillary Clinton. Some instincts die hard. As a meditation on the barbarism of last September, /The Rising/ seems incomplete. Were your knowledge of the horror limited to the lyrics on this album you could be forgiven for assuming the Twin Towers might well have collapsed due to faulty wiring. Still, most songs have their poignant moments and are pure distillations of certain aspects of the national mood as only Springsteen could channel them. <br />Regardless, the most important thing about /The Rising/ is that there is nearly an hour's worth of excellent and instantly likable songs, with only a few duds added on. The sound of the band is more refined than most E Street classics, producing a polished sonic texture akin to /Human Touch/. But the songs nevertheless rekindle a presence that has eluded Springsteen for some time. \\"My City of Ruins,\\" the album's signature song, recalls the epic-length performances of such classics as \\"New York City Serenade\\" and \\"The E Street Shuffle\\" from the band's club shows. Songs like \\"Mary's Place,\\" where Springsteen really uncorks his band's power, resurrect the rough passion of \\"Rosalita.\\" The album's more subdued songs, including \\"Nothing Man,\\" \\"Into the Fire,\\" and \\"Paradise,\\" keep the sound current but would compare well played beside any favorite ballad from /Nebraska/ or /Darkness on the Edge of Town/. And then there are two masterpieces: \\"Empty Sky\\" and \\"You're Missing.\\"
B00005JL3A|1.0|I was waiting anxiously for this movie to be released and I am now wondering why.  This was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years. It is a mish-mosh of totally irrelevant scenarios and I, being a fan of horror for years, lost interest in the first fifteen minutes. If you enjoy the game, do not purchase this film. I have a feeling that we should expect to see Resident Evil 2 on the horizon, due to the ending. Please don't bother.
B000021YQV|5.0|If you want some good intense, brutal, and energy-filled metal, this is the album for you.  Still doing well on the billboards and selling like crazy, System of a Down's \\"Toxicity\\" is one spectacular album.<br />Every song is great and filled with energy.  Very political at times as well.  Much so like Rage Against the Machine, except imagine them all on speed.  And the lead singer can sing beautifully, or yell and growl like hell.  All songs are for the most part very fast-paced.  The guitars are great, the druming is great, and most of all, the vocals are outstanding.<br />Favorite songs include \\"prison song,\\" \\"needles,\\" \\"chop suey!\\" \\"bounce,\\" \\"science,\\" shimmy,\\" \\"aerials,\\" and \\"toxicity.\\"  But trust me, every song is great.<br />One weak side is since the songs are so fast-paced, they are rather short, making the CD length not that long.  But all of that is made up by including some great music and songs.<br />So if this sounds like something you would like, then check out \\"Toxicity,\\" a.s.a.p.  It's a great album to listen to when you're driving, but if you have this bad boy in, everybody else on the road better make sure they know how to use the gas pedal, because your foot will be pressing on it HARD!  \\"Look out, you fools!  Get out of my way!!!\\"
B00000IAU3|5.0|When the album was released I bought this album immediately, but I was disapointed because after first listen I thought that all the songs sounded the same. But when I listened to it the second and third time, I changed my mined and now I absolutely love this album. All the songs are worth a listen, but especially I like Thank You and Isobel. These are very beautiful songs. If you<BR>haven`t got this album yet, go and buy it now. Believe me it`s worth your money.
B0000640VO|5.0|I don't often view foreign language films.  I find it maddening to try to read the subtitles and watch the film at the same time.  Also, I had heard such glowing reviews about this film that I was prepared to be disappointed as well as frazzled.  I could not have been more wrong.<br />This is a wonderful, wonderful film.  Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a mousey girl living in Paris whose life is so ordinary that it borders on pathetic.  One day she discovers a tin box in her apartment with little toys and keepsakes of a young child that was hidden behind a wall decades ago.  She sets out on a mission to find the boy and return the treasures to him.  If the mission has a positive effect, she vows to devote herself to doing good deeds for others.  This leads to numerous touching and droll adventures, where Amelie doles out her own personal brand of justice to various characters, both good and evil.  Along the way she discovers love and turns it into a cat and mouse game of mystery and fascination, making her lover fall for her and pursue her without ever knowing who she is.<br />The story is brilliantly written, with a wry sense of humor.  Only the French could make mundane situations so funny, ironic, charming and philosophical at the same time.  It is a marvelous mix of intrigue, misdirection and offbeat humor.  Director Jean Pierre Jeunet squeezes the maximum amount of wit, sentimentality and humanness from every frame.  The Parisian street scenes are wonderfully done showing us more of an insider's look at Paris than a tourist's guidebook.<br />Audrey Tautou is captivating in the lead role.  She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, full of breathy enthusiasm with a twinkle in her eye and mischief on her mind.  When she is good she's wonderful, and when she's bad she's even better.<br />This is an enthralling delight of a film, like a glass of sparkling French burgundy.  It will make you chuckle and tug your heart strings.  I rated it a 10/10.  Even if you hate subtitles, seethis film.  You won't regret it.
B000069HKH|5.0|This record will turn out, without doubt, to contain the most important songs that Springsteen has produced in his career. 15 Tracks, including the inevitable couple of clunkers and fillers, but it also the most vital and relevant work he's done. Forget the fact it's the first E Street band album since 1984 - that's an irrelevance on a massive scale, nice though it is to see. <br />Almost exclusively written after 9/11, (although the track he sang at the NY TV Tribute, 'My City in Ruins', included here in a band version, was written prior to 9/11 about Asbury Park), Bruce has concentrated on what he has done best during the last 30 years - expressing heroism, loss and heartbreak through the eyes of individuals. No need for overblown rhetoric - the album is littered with raw human emotion, witnessed through ordinary people affected by the events of September 11, and overlaid with the Springsteen staples of redemption and faith. The themes which have defined his work over the years -   <br />'Mister, I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man, and I believe in the promised land' - 'The Promised Land' 1978, <br />'I believe in the love that you gave me, I believe the faith that can save me, I believe in the hope and I pray, that someday it may raise me, above these badlands - you gotta live it every day, let the broken hearts stand as the price you gotta pay' - 'Badlands' 1978<br />'You wanna know why I did what I did, well I guess there's just a meanness in this world' - 'Nebraska' 1982<br />'We swore we'd travel, darling, side by side, we'd help each other to stay in stride. But each lover's steps fall so differently - I'll wait for you, and should I fall behind, wait for me' - 'If I should fall behind' 1992<br />'Dreams will not be thwarted, faith will be rewarded' - 'Land of Hope and Dreams' 1999<br /> - take on devastating clarity in this post 9/11 world.<br />Even Mary from Born to run's opener 'Thunder Road' (1975) turns up like a long lost friend (Mary's Place') - 'I spent years putting all these people in all these cars - but I needed to see what happened to them when they arrived wherever they were heading' - (Springsteen 1978). After running away together all those years ago in 'Thunder Road', trying to settle down a few years later in 'The Promise' (1979), there Mary is again, throwing a party trying to lift some of the gloom. But there's a cloud, literally and metaphorically hanging over events<br />Some of the explicitly 9/11 songs are heartbreaking - 'Into the Fire', a lament from the wife of a firefighter starts<br />The Sky was falling and streaked with blood<BR>I heard you calling me<BR>Then you disappeared into the dust<BR>Up the stairs, into the fire.........<br />and contains this fabulous verse<br />You gave your love to see<BR>in the fields of red and autumn brown<BR>You gave your love to me<BR>and lay your young body down<BR>Up the stairs into the fire<BR>I need you near, but love and duty<BR>called you someplace higher<BR>Somewhere up the stairs, into the fire<br />Another killer track (sic) is called 'Nothin' Man', written from the point of view of a rescue worker, who is now feted as a hero wherever he goes, while he still is trying to sift through what happened in his own mind - <br />I don't remember how I felt<BR>I never thought I'd live<BR>To read about myself<BR>In my hometown paper<BR>How my brave young life was forever changed<BR>In a misty cloud of pink vapor........<br />......You can call me Joe<BR>Buy me a drink and shake my hand<BR>You want courage<BR>I'll show you courage you can understand<br />The other openly 9/11 songs are just as brutally frank - the title of 'Empty Sky' pretty much speaks for itself, and the chorus<br />Empty Sky, empty sky<BR>I woke up this morning to an empty sky <br />feels and sounds like some sort of religious mantra<br />Into the Fire's companion piece (IMHO) is, possibly, the best piece of work Bruce has ever produced - a song called 'You're missing' which has had me in tears more than once already<br />The music? Well, it's pretty much standard E Street band/solo Bruce stuff - nothing spectacularly has changed by bringing in Brendon O'Brien as the Producer instead of the usual Springsteen/Jon Landau combination, but this is one of those times where the music is secondary. Personally, since it was recorded in Atlanta and Nashville, I'd have liked it to have been recorded as a full blown country record, with acoustic guitars, a fiddle and standup bass, but what the hell, the Boss knows best.......yeah right<br />In 100 years, when people try and make sense of the events of last year, these songs will be one of the places they go. You need this record..<br />Cheers<br />Tim
B000065U1N|4.0|For producer Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Beverly Hills Cop\\", \\"Flashdance\\", \\"Top Gun\\", \\"The Rock\\", \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Remember the Titans\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\"), this is a departure from the crowd pleasers he usually produces.  Bruckheimer is one of the most successful producers in Hollywood because he knows that crowd pleasers make a buck.  Even \\"Pearl Harbor\\" wasn't really about Pearl Harbor, but about a love story with Pearl Harbor as the backdrop.  Here, Bruckheimer produces a straight, no nonsense action film with controversial subject matter and none of his standard crowd pleasing elements.  Oh, and by the way, he still made money.<br />This is not a film for the squeamish.  War is hell and this film turns up the fire.  It is a frank and realistic representation of war, much the same as the beach scene of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", only once the action starts, it never lets up.  Ridley Scott gives us a raw depiction of modern warfare, based on actual events from the US military action in Somalia.  Despite a lot of criticism of Scott for not delving deeper into the political issues, I believe he made the right decision in staying focused on this as a combat film.  <br />What is so unlike a Bruckheimer film is that there is no workup of any single character.  There is no attempt to get us to love someone and have us pulling for him.  He just gives us a bunch of ordinary grunts that get thrown into a fire fight and try desperately to fight their way out to survive.  No one is a hero, and everyone is.<br />Scott's direction of the action scenes is superb.  This film maintains a dizzying pace and Scott never lets us catch our breath with stunt work and pyrotechnics that defy description.  There is no safety net in this film where we know that certain characters won't die.  Everyone in the cast is a potential casualty.  While this is extremely realistic, it is also one of the shortcomings of the film.  By the end, the viewer suffers from battle fatigue and there is no emotional consolation that at least one character we liked came out okay.<br />The ensemble cast does a fine job of creating realistic battle scenes, though there isn't a lot of meaningful dialogue.  The actors had to go through real military basic training in preparation for the film and it hardened them for the exhausting rigors of their roles.  Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore stood out slightly from the rest, but only because they each had slightly meatier roles.<br />This is an intense and credible war film that doesn't so much engage viewers as it does overwhelm us.  From an action perspective it is a 12/10, but in the area of storytelling and character development it falls short.  I rated it an 8/10.  See it, but brace yourself.
6305807086|5.0|I don't know if this movie really means something but it worth to watch it just to see one of the strangest stories I have ever known. It's so absurd that makes you laugh without being entirely a comedy. The characters are: A frustrated puppeteer who doesn't earn enough money; his wife, a woman obsessed with animals and have many of them living in their home; his boss, who lives thinking that he, has a speech defect because the deaf secretary always misunderstands everything; an arrogant and manipulative woman; and John Malkovich, played by himself, he is not the main character but is the center of the story. In the seven and a half floor of a building, there is a small door that takes you straight to John Malkovich's head, letting you see what he sees, hear what he hears, and feel what he feels for 15 minutes. When this portal is discovered, it starts a lot of weird and hilarious situations. Maybe the main topic is the right of privacy in times where we can see cameras in every place, watching every step we take, and even in TV shows like Big Brother. If you want to see something different but great, then get this movie.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Well now London's Calling is a Jaguar comercial. Tisk tisk. It certainly is a great album. I got this back in high school in 1979. I heard this before the Pistols and was in over my head. But really I loved this stuff because it was like something I've heard and nothing at all like I've experienced. With Jimmy Jazz, Spanish Bombs, Death or Glory, the Card Cheat and Revolution Rock and all these other songs that just were simply out of this world or as I had come to realize all about this world. I still haven't experienced front--on a whole lot of music that captures the incredible and insidiously beautifuly written music on this release.
B000021Y77|5.0|Very fast movie, too many things happen in just seconds, few moments to breathe. It's absolutely non-boring and takes your heartbeats to the top. The music is also very fast, it makes an excellent complement. Lola's anxiety to get the money and meet her boyfriend before 20 minutes is transmitted to the viewer. Many elements are found in the movie, for example: animations, split screens and flashing pictures. The look of Lola is very peculiar: a young girl with intense red hair, she is difficult to forget. The same story repeats three times, however, each time, different things happen; all of them caused directly or indirectly by Lola herself, and each version of the story has a completely opposite ending. The message is clear: Everything we do, even the most insignificant action, affect drastically our future and the other people's destiny.
6300249867|4.0|What do you know, another treasurechest of a movie. Its funny how I found it, staying in a winter chateau. Black Widow was buried on a shelf of books and other movies for the traveler. So I popped it in at 2 a.m. and was taken into this world, like having fallen into a magic drain pipe. Not many people have heard of Debra Winger's co-star, but Theresa Russell proves, like in The Razor's Edge, with the appearance of the right script, her character will stand on the edge looking down, then she's your woman. Winger had the movie ripped from her mouth in a scene at a Hawaian party. She told Russell she was on to her husband-killing game and presented her with a gift-jewel widow. R's retort: \\"She kills, but can she love.\\" Cornered she grabs Winger and kisses her on the lips- a little improve?..oh yea, definitely. The plot is fairly simple: Russell crawls under the richmans door and into his fortune with her eyes closed, counts the money and executes whistle-clean homicide. Winger then leaves her FBI office to a field chase; she is sexy as hell after breaking her menagerie, you know, her new haircut. Pure escapism. The gambler wants action, not money. D.W. and I know this.
B00000099Y|1.0|Ugh. \\"Aenima,\\" the deplorable, unredeeming album with a totally inexplicable cult following, is perhaps the worst single record I have ever heard (and I've heard A LOT). Even worse than the collective works of Limp Bizkit because while LB knows it's stupid, advertises itself as stupid, and is regarded as stupid by a vast majority of the American public, Tool sells themselves as smart. So they're liars, too.<BR>But that's the people. Lots of bad, stupid people are great artists. So what's wrong with Aenima? It's rote, boring, ugly, dismal, pretentious, meaningless, and LONG. <BR>The lyrics (and their subjects, if any) are some of the most idiotic and/or unfocused of any in rock. Tool probably thinks they're ironic. No. <BR>The songs are long and dull and few of them ever go anywhere. The filler tracks (and there are many) are pointless additions to the already padded running time. The jokes don't work (even though the whole thing is supposed to be a joke). The one where the guy reads a cookie recipe in German through a loudspeaker against the sound of a Nazi rally sounds like a great idea on paper, but the recording SOUNDS like it's a guy in a studio reading reading a German cookie recipe through a loudspeaker to the studio-created noise of a Nazi rally. <BR>Musically, what have Tool done that Black Sabbath didn't excell at in the '70's? And made more fun?...<BR>Specifics: \\"Eulogy\\" which is interesting, and \\"Aenima,\\" which actually sounds like a rock song, are the best. \\"Stinkfist\\" is catchy, even, but it's disgusting lyric turns me off. Everything else could pass as elevator music at low levels, except for the last track, which could pass as a more focused b-side from Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music.\\" But at least Reed could make a believable argument for his artistry.<BR>Avoid... Three-dimensional imaging can be an attempt to make up for one-dimensional product.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Released in November 6 of 2001, The Album Debuted @ the #1 Spot and sold more than 745,000 copies! Nothing Compared to her 1st or 2nd album sales, but preety good enough! In my opinion, this is the best album Britney has released! There are only two tracks that aren't real good! But all the released singles are good, i'm especially feeling \\"Overprotected\\". <br />This album is to tell the whole world that she isn't a little girl anymore, she explains that in the #4 Track \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\". She also doesn't want to be governed like some little girl, she wants to do whatever she wants. In the Tracks \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", and \\"Overprotected\\" she explains that she has to do everything the people who govern her tell her to do. <br />As Final words, I believe that this is a growing album for Britney and that her 4th Studio Album will be a smash HIT! Will be able to see Britney, but as a WOMAN Not a GIRL.
B00005QIPH|3.0|First and foremost, I definitely imagine it to be a tough thing to live up to the expectations placed on these guys.  Before their cd was even released, every source of media had this band as the next best thing since....well, you fill in the blank.  Months before their release, Flaunt, Wallpaper, Source, Detour, etc all said that these guys \\"are it, period.\\"<br />Well...let's put it this way.<br />To begin, listen to \\"Last Nite\\" and then listen to \\"American Girl\\" by, of all people, Tom Petty.  There hasn't been a bigger rip-off since Kurt Cobain stole Killing Joke's song, Vanilla Ice stole \\"Under Pressure,\\" Mc Hammer stole \\"Super Freak,\\" etc., etc., etc.  The drums, the short guitar chords...almost NOTE FOR NOTE....just check it out. You'll see what I mean.<br />Second, if there never had been a band called the Buzzcocks twenty plus years ago...if Ray Davies' wasn't the musical genius that he is, EVEN if there never had been an Undertones (or, should it suit, fill in the name of your favorite power-pop band here), these guys might seem novel.  And any comparison to the beauty of Reed/Cale and gang is entirely lost on me...I see no resemblance whatsoever to VU other than, perhaps, location, location, location.  At any rate, if all of the above had never of been, then, perhaps, these guys could then say they've come up with something original and be even bigger than what they are.  Ok, so everyone rips off everyone else...point taken.  But, it's not the same here.  These guys are being hailed at the Summa Cum Jesus of the scene, and that's just wrong.<br />That being said, these boys are da*n good at what they do and they put it forth in an incredibly accessible and tasty manner.  Rightfully, this might be deserving of four stars, but I gave it three out of nothing other than spite and bitterness.  So, at least I've disclosed that and now do with it what you will.<br />All in all, a very tasty cd in a sugary-shallow sort of way.  One you will enjoy and may get a few head nods at get togethers, but, in the grand scheme of things, one that you will forget about a year from now.  Perhaps you can enjoy it while it lasts.head nods at get togethers, but, in the grand scheme of things, one that you will forget about a year from now.  Perhaps you can enjoy it while it lasts.
B000056VIY|4.0|I bought this cd because of her movie, \\"The Wedding Planner\\" and because of the song \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing.\\"  I like other songs on here as well.  I also think that Jennifer Lopez has a beautiful voice and she is a beautiful woman.  So, thumbs up for J. Lo!!!!
B000002HJR|5.0|Damn, I was one of the priveledged few who recieved the precursor of an album as a demo way back in the day. I knew Phil's voice right away, but I knew that there was no way this could be Pantera. So, being from way up north, I did some goddamn research and found out what was up and was hooked from note one. This s$!t was for real. At the time, there was nothing like this out there, and to this day, there is nothing even close. Phil says this album sounds like a demo, but to me it sounds like a breath of fresh air. The paranoia will cut your head off. Every song has something in it for true metal fans. If you like &quot;Limp Bizkit&quot; or &quot;Puddle of Mudd&quot; or &quot;System of a Down&quot; or even &quot;Linkin Park&quot; stay the hell away, this is for true believers only, no friggin rap or &quot;Nu metal&quot; here. This is honest to goodness marajuana-inspired true Sabbath-esque southern metal. No radio play or MTV videos. If you see someone with a &quot;BROES&quot; t-shirt on, shake their hand and welcome them into the realm of the elightened few that can recognize truth in its purest form, and congratulations, you won't be sorry with this one, we ain't scared, we down brah.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I didn't know anything about this anime but since I'm a fan of anime, I watched it. 99% of anime is just pure trash--mostly stupid robot wars, flying girls in school uniforms and just plain fetish stuff.<BR>Spirited Away has the best characters I've ever seen in an animation film. There are at least a dozen wonderfully weird characters that just get weirder and weirder--one character more original than the one before.<BR>It's also the funniest animation I've seen. That little frog is unforgettably funny. Chihiro, the 10 year-old girl, is clumsy and cute. I fell in love with her.<br />I hope Disney releases this film in America so everyone (and yes, you can take your kids to this one) can fall in love with it as I have.

B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of The Moon is a must-have CD. I believe it is the best-selling CD of all time, and for good reason.
6304401736|5.0|I admire this movie for the cruelness and wickedness of Cruella.  The best example of this is when she tries but fails to buy the puppies from Anita and Roger.  So she sends Horace and Jasper to steal them.  Now it's a wild chase to return the puppies to their home.  It's an action-packed and exciting movie.  I also recommend 102 Dalmatians.
B000060MY6|2.0|Mulholland Drive could have been so much more. From the opening scene, it seems like a tight, suspenseful thriller with an interesting storyline and above-average cast. A woman loses her memory as the result of a car accident, which occurred as her limo driver was in the process of pointing a gun at her. She is the only survivor of the crash, and joins up with a Hollywood starlet-wannabe as they try to determine exactly who she is. As the film rolls merrily along, the viewer becomes ever more intrigued as to the true identity of \\"Rita\\" - is she on the wrong side of the law? Why did her limo driver want to kill her, and is someone coming back to finish the job? <br />About two-thirds of the way into this movie, director David Lynch suddenly remembers what is expected of him - namely, movies that don't make sense and tangled plots that never become disentangled. After an impressive 100 minutes or so, the last one-third of Mulholland Drive is quintessential Lynch, in that it flatly contradicts everything that has already happened, and nothing is resolved. Although the movie is 2.5 hours long, the ending comes rather abruptly, and leaves too many questions unanswered.
B000069HKH|2.0|One can only wonder about what the phenomenal popularity and questionable artistry of this 50-plus year old rocker says about our current pop culture. A poor hybrid of old Dylan and the late 60's group Steppenwolf, most of this material of 3-4 chord guitar blasters is simply an embarrassment. Even more embarrassing is how aging boomers actually think this may be among the best music ever recorded! Half baked lyrics that would barely get a solid grade in a high school English class, mixed with shouting and dull melodies, and even duller arrangements, make for barely acceptable results. But given the competition in today's pop/rock scene, this is probably among the best, in a regrettable genre. As a contrast, I suggest anyone spend a few dollars, and buy the 43 year \\"Come Dance With Me\\" from a long ago era, by another New Jerseyite, Frank Sinatra, which completely blows away this sadly overwrought and overrated production..PS, anyone following the SEPTEMBER 2001 MASSACRES (for me, the very term \\"9/11\\" almost trivializes it) should have been reading the NEW YORK TIMES daily, especially the profiles/portraits of the victims of this uniquely monstrous massacre.
0140186395|5.0|I chose to read this book for my high school's required reading. It was a great decision. <BR>Though this book goes slowly (took me a week to read), it doesn't feel slow. Steinbeck's lavish descriptions of the lush California transport me there. <BR>But this book isn't meant to revolve around the plot. The characters drive the plot, not the other way around. I agree that the many of the characters are hard to relate to, but I can understand them. From the most evil character, Cathy, to nice guy Sam Hamilton, I could see why they chose to commit each action. The youngest characters in the book, Abra, Aron, and Cal, are easier to relate to by teenagers such as myself.<BR>Though this book was written half a century ago, the themes are timeless. There is the battle between good and evil, which encompasses sub themes like jealousy.<BR>Overall, this is a book that's worth your time.

B00005221M|2.0|I'm in a small minority on this picture as I gave it a 5 when 77 percent of everyone else gave it a 7 or greater.<br />My problem with \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" starts with the fact that director Michael Mann made it difficult to follow plot developments. I found myself guessing every 10 minutes about what had happened.<br />Secondly, it wasn't clear until late in the movie that Hawkeye's Mohican companions were his step-father and step-brother. Since these characters weren't developed, one feels next to nothing when the step-brother is killed.<br />Thirdly, the romance between Hawkeye and Cora seems to spring fully-grown from a five-minute conversation under the stars one night. When it was clear to me that the two were supposed to be in love, my reaction was, \\"Gee, that was fast.\\"<br />Fourthly, the director (and probably the writers, too) pretend that the smooth-bore muskets used at the time were as accurate as rifles. Hawkeye fires at moving targets and never misses. At one point he clearly takes a long range shot to put a man being tortured out of his misery. Even 50 years after the time the film is set muskets were next to useless beyond 100 yards. They also delivered a substantial kick when fired, and Hawkeye performs the impossible by firing two at once, from the hip, on the run. No way in hell that's possible.<br />Lastly, I was surprised to find Daniel Day-Lewis' acting so wooden and unconvincing, considering his reputation.<br />The best thing about this movie is the special effects, which is a compliment I seldom make. I think Mann accurately reproduced the sound and the amount of smoke that muskets produce in battle. And the scenes of the fort under siege were well done, particularly the shot from long range when the sights preceded the sounds.
B000066I6N|5.0|Many great rock and roll heroes of the '70s follow the same formula that made them successful 'till long after they've run out of decent music to churn out. Not Robert Plant. Since Led Zeppelin broke up Plant has refused to play the game of the nostalgia act. And Plant's latest album is no exception.<br />While some critics will certainly have a field day, attacking this album's lack of new songs at every tune, one must take into account the performances. On this album, Plant and his backing group (possibly the best of his solo career) are able to merge blues and folk with the psychadelica you would think of when you think of San Francisco. This is nowhere near raunchy heavy metal, but more along the lines of progressive, which sometimes even resembles Radiohead. And many thanks to producers Plant and Phil Brown, who deliver in giving this album an unusual atmosphere, which only adds to the menace of Hey Joe, the sadness of Darkness Darkness. the mysteriousness of Win My Train Far Home, and the beauty of Song to the Siren.<br />What shows most about this album is that Plant clearly cares about these songs, and that this period in music history clearly meant a lot to him as a person and as a musician. However he is also smart enough (or adventerous enough) to know that no one wants to hear (or he doesn't want to do) the same re hashed version of a classic song. Every song is given something new. Perhaps the best example is Morning Dew, a song completely re-done (as opposed to the group that played it the most, the Grateful Dead) with keyboards, strings, backwards guitar, and just about the highest bass notes you'll ever hear.) Added to One More Cup of Coffee are eerie classical guitar licks, keyboards, and vocal highs that Dylan has never reached, and never will. But perhaps the most re-worked song of the bunch is Hey Joe. Absent is any evidence of Hendrix's fun, bluesy, proto-metal guitar licks, are sound effects, guitar riffs, drums, and vocals that seem to come straight out of hell. In many ways Plant wrote the music of these songs, and only the lyrics remain from the original versions.<br />In conclusion don't underestimate Dreamland. It is not an album full of rehash. This is very new music, and stands up quite well with the best music of Robert Plant's career. (Including those classic Led Zep albums) If you always preferred the music of Jefferson Airplane or Pink Floyd than perhaps the all-out psychadelic folk of Dreamland will satisfy your musical taste. Enjoy!
B00003CXTG|3.0|Michael Bay's film commemorating the attack on Pearl Harbor tries to relive the story of a love affair set against a disaster like the film Titanic does, but it tries too hard.<br />Pearl Harbor should have been three separate films. The movie jumps back and forth between the love triangle of Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett and the political dealings of the U.S. and Japanese government. In other words, it's trying to have the intimate, emotional story of Titanic, and the political, historical story of Thirteen Days. Then, thrown in the mix for some unknown reason, are scenes with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the first commended black soldier, which feels like it's just tacked into the movie. There's barely any connection between him and the other main characters. His story deserved its on movie, not as an afterthought in this film. Michael Bay should have decided if he wanted to make a historically accurate account of Pearl Harbor, or an emotional and intimate portrayal of a group of friends caught in the middle of the attack.<br />This movie tries too hard to be too many things, and that is why it fails.<br />But, that is not to say there isn't anything worthwhile in Pearl Harbor. Perhaps one of the most visually astonishing battle sequences ever put to film is in this movie. The actual attack is both beautiful and horrifying. If feels like there were really cameras there to capture it. The 45-minute-attack is simply amazing, and worth multiple viewings.<br />However, where Titanic succeeds in mixing the love storyline in with the disaster, Pearl Harbor puts the love story aside for 45 minutes, and picks it up later. The attack felt like a different film.<br />Another problem is the film tries to manipulate the audience to feel patriotic and emotional. I don't have a problem with a film invoking a feeling of national pride, but certain pieces of dialogue and scenes try so hard to make the audience feel something, it loses any subtlety. I don't like it when amovie basically tells me loud and clear &quot;Feel sad now, and patriotic!&quot; I prefer the more effective subtly Titanic uses.<br />This movie had potential, but lost it through its schizophrenic nature.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|If you want to watch a movie for pure fun (not overall content) watch this movie.  Sure it does not have the best script or the best cast, but it is pure action at its finest.  The special effect / Make-up effects are very well done.
B00005UK1F|5.0|I think the only thing you need to know about this record is you need to get it. \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\\" has been hanging around and everytime I listen to it, I'm still impressed with just how incredible this is. Tchort's musical arrangements are sheer genius, and there are no spots of weakness throughout the 60-minute journey, as you are constantly beaten down with huge, incredible walls of sound. The texture of the sound is crafted beautifully, ranging from heavy as hell sections to a sax/female vocal solo with nothing but atmospheric effects swirling around behind it. The solos are extremely well done, the instrumentals are powerful, well-placed, and definitely don't need Kjetil Nordhus' haunting, unique vocals to hold it up.<br />Anything you have heard about this band is true, unless you heard they suck. Get this album. NOW.
B00000FCBC|3.0|OK, this was a good cover album these boys made, it is what led the beginning to the thought that metallica are pretty much out of good ideas to make anymore of their own great albums, so they'll give us an idea on some of the bands they were influenced by.  Lets start with disc one, we have the radio friendly's turn the page and whiskey in the jar.  Musically, its great, outstanding.  Vocally, my God hetfield, dont try to sound like the singers, use your own vocal style like you had on the justice album, and lose this irish accent you have going on.  <br />Its a shame they didnt keep the influence of all these great british metal bands that inspired them like they once had in the 80's, oh well.  I gotta say disc 2 is much better vocally, even though hetfield's vocals are more mature and deeper then they used to be, its too much the same, this yea, yea, screaming over and over again, enough already.  Also, why the hell didnt they cover any maiden songs? Maiden was the top influence they had aside from Motorhead, I mean even though im sure the vocals wouldve been bad, still wouldve been nice to hear em cover some maiden classics, that way you couldve maybe heard jason's or cliff's(RIP) bass a hell of alot better. Oh well, id say stick with the garage days revisited cd, which would be disc 2 for this, and minus the vocals on disc 1, it wouldve rocked.  I say this though, all you posers out there thinking metallica is so amazing, get into the bands they were influenced by, you will be saved, and youll see that real metal is still out there.  That is all.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt didn't sell out with their new release. They just flipped the script and decided to venture into a different territory. And it's not a bad thing, either. I haven't bought their CD yet, but I've heard their singles. All three of their singles are huge and I'm diggin the Caribbean-flavored single \\"Underneath It All\\". So, if you grew up on No Doubt, don't give up on them. You don't need that [money], so just buy the CD. NOWW!!! :p
B000063V8R|5.0|The appearance of the third season box set is no different than the first two. The interior folder for the DVDs, the small fold out booklet, and the listing of which episode is on which DVD is the same as the other two seasons. The difference happens when you put the DVD in. Instead of showing clips of the episodes one after another, the screen is divided into four sections, with clips of each episode playing simultaneously. I think this is a nice change, it's a bit distracting to try and watch all four sets of clips, but if you're looking for one episode in particular, this cuts down on the waiting.<br />The third season is essentially like the first two, there's special features on the last DVD, and the episodes are laid out the same way on each disk.  The consistency is really nice, and if it continues through the whole set it will end up being a nice collectable for Star Trek: The Next Generation fans.
B0000029LG|5.0|Except for Childhood, Smile, Little Susie, and History which was just an ok song. This was a great album. However I don't see the point of the first disc. Anyone who listens to Michael's previous albums knows that every song pretty much stands by itself. There are never any filler songs or B sides to his albums. He has always made albums so that they can be listened to in their entirety without having to skip songs. So if you think that by just listening to the first disc you have heard all of his best work before listening to the second disc it's not true. He's one of the few artists where a greatest hits album is not necessary. Every album Michael comes out with is like a greatest hits album in itself. This one is no exception either, except for the songs I mentioned earlier.
B000062XFG|5.0|The second season is essentially like the first, the set and DVD layout is essentially the same. The most notable different is the number of episodes: there are only 22, not 26 like the first season. Apparently there was a strike that year with one of the guild working on the series (I think the writers guild), and so only 22 episodes were produced.<br />The extra features are nice, some people have complained that there are not enough of them for the price, but if you think about it, the cost of the box set is a lot less than purchasing each episode on tape. With the cost of each episode on tape running about [price], the DVD is a steal, even at the list price the episodes run about [price] each. <br />Most of the episodes in this season are better than the first, but to rate them here would take too long.  Letting one or two episodes I disliked bring down the rating of the box set doesn't seem right to me anyway. People who like Star Trek: The next Generation and have purchased the first season will probably purchase this as well regardless of whether they loved or hated each spisode.
B000069HKH|3.0|No question this album is great--just does not compare favorably to the first 6 albums in my estimation.  \\"Jackson Cage\\" off of \\"The River\\" would be one of the best songs on this album despite not being in the top 10 on its own album.  But who can possibly expect Bruce to replicate that stunning run of genius early in his career?  That being said, the album is filled with great hooks and some of the most beautiful ballads he has ever written.  \\"City of Ruins\\", \\"Nothingman\\", \\"Paradise\\", \\"Empty Sky\\" are solid, top-line Springsteen songs, and \\"Countin' on a Miracle,\\" \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"Into the Fire\\", \\"You're Missing\\" also solid.  Three stinkers: \\"Worlds Away\\" (which is some of the worst ... he's ever done, \\"The Fuse\\" (ditto) and \\"Let's be Friends\\" (nice hook, but I'd rather have \\"The Angel\\").  Bottom Line: Better than anything else out there today but doesn't hold a candle to vintage Bruce.  You'll love it once you can get over that....
B000065V1V|5.0|This is David's best CD in over 20 years! Fantastic, inspired, brilliant. I have been listening to this CD all summmer and I still find it irresistible. Bowie has picked top-notch musicians for this one. David Torn (on guitar) adds all the right ingredients. Torn is a guitar genius who collaborates with many other progressive artists. He adds guitar atmosphere's much in the same way as Robert Fripp did on Scary Monsters and Heroes. Tony Levin plays bass on one track and Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater) plays keyboards on some of the tracks. Bowie has achieved a high level of art on Heathen. His writing is as good or better than anything from the past. Very current with the times. He has tapped into the source on this one! Strange none of the reviews I have read on these review pages even mentioned Torn's influence on this CD?
0312962118|5.0|Snow Wolf is absolutely terrific, one of the best books I've ever read. However, I recently finished his latest, Resurrection Day, published only in Europe, and not in the USA (banned, I hear, because of the controversial and sensitive subject matter!) Resurrection Day is an incredible book, prescient and right up to the minute, about an Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on Washington DC--and one of the best books I've ever read, a must for Meade fans, up there with Snow Wolf, and maybe even better. You have to read Resurrection Day--it's scary, fast paced, and stunning. US readers can order it through Amazon.co.uk. Don't miss it.
B000063S6Z|1.0|Yeah, I'm angry. At Moby. And at his record label, for asking me or any other consumer to actually pay for this disc. I've been a fan of Moby's and of electronica in general for over 20 years and I'm completely offended by this material. In short, it's [bad].<br />Anybody who had the slighest notion that this man is nothing more than a product of a masterful PR machine is proven right beyond a doubt upon listening. <br />Moby can't sing to save his life. The songs are sophomoric drivel, taking the word \\"repetitious\\" to a new level. I couldn't even sit through the entire record.<br />It especially pains me to see truly vital electronic artists get sidelined in lieu of such an unmusical effort. How critics can find any redeeming value in this disc is beyond me. Is this what people consider the epitome of the genre? If so, I feel sorry for everyone else who might try to do something meaningful. May as well just release the first few demos and hope for the best, because that's what it sounds like Moby did here.<br />While Play and his earlier efforts are novel, and sometimes inspired, digressions into the electronica genre, 18 is most likely the maximum amount of minutes you should devote to this disc. <br />A waste of acrylic. But makes a great drink coaster.
B00005YXZH|1.0|The media line was that Wilco's old record company refused to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot because they just didn't understand the art to it.  After one listen, I realized they didn't release it because it is so bad.  I loved Son Volt and Wilco's first CD.  Tweedy has degraded into something that doesn't even sound good.  For the most part the songs all sound alike.  Tweedy's lyrics are delivered in a subdued monotone with random electronic noises thrown in.  What happened to the enthusiasm this guy used to have?
B00005QIPH|5.0|Thank god for the Strokes, Hives, Vines, And White Stripes...  With out them, main stream rock would [be bad].  Yes, I like indie rock too, but it's good to see that EVERYONE can hear this wonderfully simple ADDICTING music.  It's hard to describe this cd, other than minimilist rock with street punk, grunge, indie, and classic rock sensabilities.  ~Andy
B00006CXSS|5.0|Absolutely extraordinary televison. A powerful portrait of what it must be like to be thrust into such an overwhelming conflict, especially without knowing very much about your enemy. Gripping and, at times, incredibly gut-wrenching (see the episode where they finally discover a concentration camp). Every element put into each episode comes together beautifully.<br />The idea to focus more on a different soldier each episode, while not letting the other characters fade into the background, was an innovative approach. Every actor shines in his role, bringing incredible depth to their portrayals. They make you cheer for every one of their triumphs, no matter how big or how small, and they make you feel for them when they're at their lowest. The fact that any one of the characters could die at any moment almost makes you want to not get very involved with any of their stories, but the actors put so much into each character that you just can't help feeling for them. Such is the greatness of this show.
B000003S0P|5.0|Time -- all 28 years of it -- has been extraordinarily kind to the last album produced by the stable of musicians that wafted in and out of guitarist Robert Fripp's life from 1969 to 1974. 'Red' was the third King Crimson outing featuring the core trio of Fripp, John Wetton (bass and vocals), and yes-man Bill Bruford (percussion), along with some guest appearances by friends and former Crimsonites who add violin, brass and woodwinds. Upon release, for some reason 'Red'  seemed like sloppy seconds compared to the textures of  'Lark's Tongue's in Aspic' or the nocturnal bumps of 'Starless and Bible Black' . But listening to 'Red' now, you realize that these guys were ON , and the two years spent on the previous albums brought this ensemble  to its peak.<BR>With the exception of the improvisational noodlings of 'Providence', this album is one skillfully executed crunch. Don't let the grunge comparisons fool you, even if you've never heard a note of Nirvana, Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains, you might easily fall under the spell of  this collection. The title track is a relentless drive lead by Fripp's razor-sharp guitar, providing respite only in a minor-key middle section. When Fripp reformed Crimso in the 1980s, this track was resurrected for their live gigs and continued as a staple through the end of the Levin/Bruford era in the late 90s. No matter how many times it's been resurrected, it never fails to provide a punch. 'Fallen Angel' comes in on little cat feet and quickly turns aggressive, a mood that stalks the next cut, 'One More Red Nightmare'.  <BR>On vinyl, this brought side one to a close. 'Providence' opened up side two as a retreat from the storm. I'm still not sure what I think of it after all these years, but the same cannot be said for the album's closer, 'Starless', which for me is the ultimate distillation of King Crimson, bar none. Melodious vocals, pounding guitar licks and soaring sax bring the album (and King Crimson as we knew it)  to an extraordinary climax. When the song closes, it's like a sarcophagus lid crashing down. Only two other musical endings have quite the same impact on me: Mahler's Sixth Symphony and (for historical reasons), the Beatles little ditty 'The End' which finishes 'Abbey Road'.<BR>'Red' was apparently made under extraordinary duress, but it is case of tension working towards positive art. Fripp decided to give Crimson a rest before resurrecting the band as a more disciplined outfit in 1981, which brings me to a final note. Tony Levin, bassist extraordinaire who graced the 80's/90s King Crimson, played a one-man concert in a local shop. I spoke with him afterwards and suggested the the band resurrect  'Starless' for their live gigs. Much to my surprise, he had never heard the song, but if we're lucky perhaps he'll take my suggestion to heart, and  we'll hear it again in all it's glory.
B000006OBQ|5.0|If you never got to see Sinatra in concert, than this live album is especially a blessing. Recorded during Frank's glory days in Vegas in 1966, it captures the man in all of his live glory. With Count Basie &amp; His Orchestra backing him up, Frank breezes right through such classics as &quot;Come Fly With Me,&quot; &quot;I've Got You Under My Skin,&quot; &quot;Luck Be A Lady,&quot; and many more. Sinatra is also a master stand-up comedian: his hilarious monologue about his Rat Pack buddies and his days growing up is absolutely priceless, just like his musical performance captured here. With &quot;Sinatra At The Sands,&quot; Frank allowed his fans the world over to spend a very cool evening with him, and it's a show that you'll want to experience again and again. Put it on, Charlie, and let the Chairman give you a good time. :-)
B000069CWE|5.0|It's true that LP went pretty much all hip hop on this disc, but it's solid.  If you don't like the hip hop side of LP, then you don't really like them that much because part of the greatness of them is their ability to blend hip hop and rock into one genre and make that into one of the best CDs in years in my opinion.   Reanmiation is an excellent CD to purchase while you wait for their actual sophomore CD
B00005JL3A|5.0|An awesome action packed on the edge of your seat horror movie with hot chicks.
B00000FBRE|5.0|This could have been Lagwagon's best album...but IT'S WAY TOO SHORT!  I was just begging for more after the cd ended and clocked in at a whopping 25:25.  But while it lasts, Let's Talk About Feelings is really one of the best cds you can buy if you like any type of punk music at all.  The lyrics are great, Joey Cape's vocals are him at his best, and the band's sound is really something to behold.  This band just gets better and better with each album...the stand-outs here are &quot;Gun In Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Hurry Up and Wait&quot;, &quot;Messengers&quot;, &quot;Owen Meaney&quot; and the ever-popular &quot;May 16&quot;.
B00006690G|5.0|This album is one of the best albums i have ever heard. Nothing can compare to it. My favorite song, believe it or not, is \\"Drips\\". The chorus is very catchy. WARNING: \\"Drips\\" is a song delivering a detailed description of sex and STDs that that should NOT be exposed to children (if i may borrow a line from \\"PSA\\" in the Slim Shady LP) with laces in their shoes. That song was also cut from the edited version of \\"The Eminem Show\\". Ok. Another gem on this album is \\"Sing for the Moment\\" The message is so deep, including an excerpt from the infamous song \\"Dream on\\" by Aerosmith that talks about how kids will be kids. In short, tracks 2,3,4,5,7,9,10,12,14 and 16 really stand out as hits that you may hear on the radio. In general, it seems to me that Em is just explaining himself, and he does a damn good job of doing it.
B000007MVX|2.0|I bought this CD because it's commonly compared to what is, in my opinion, the greatest Jethro Tull album, Thick as a Brick. I can't believe that anyone would mention these two albums in the same sentence, never mind comparing them. Thick as a Brick is musically, lyrically, and conceptually an almost flawless album. A Passion Play has very weak lyrics, and while the concept and music are bearable, they're nothing to write home about. I've read all sorts of reviews on this site, and I wonder if these people listened to the same song I did. <BR>  That said, anyone reading this is probably wondering why, if i hate this album that much, why I gave it 2 stars rather then one. well, that' because I don't &quot;hate&quot; the album. The first time I listened to it I was very disappointed that Jethro Tull could put out such a poor piece of music. Now you must understand I listened to it on a portable CD player, and anyone who frequently uses these knows you hear a lot more of the details of the music because, quite simply, it's pretty much all you focus on. The second time I listened to it was on my large stereo while doing something else. The second time around it did sound better, it seemed to flow, not as choppy as when I'd originally heard it.<BR>  Anyway, this is just my opinion. I'm a big Tull fan, and I was dissapointed, if you buy it, you may love it, everyone else who wrote a review seemed to enjoy it, but I'd recommend Thick as a Brick first.
0380789035|5.0|This is a story about a man searching for answers and peace after a few rocky years and numerous horrendous situations.  He finds mythology and intreage in his journey around America and is changed forever.  It is a wonderfully developed metaphore on life and belief, as the author drives you down many roads at the same time yet ending up at a decisive destination.  At times reading like poetry, the writing is descriptive and beatiful, and at times descriptive and disturbing.  A brilliantly moving story that left me bitter when I had finnished it-I wanted to read more.  Very entertaining and edifying.
0767830555|5.0|One of the best films ever made. DeNiro has never shined this much before. M.S.'s finest film.<br />This DVD is a must with great extras for all the fans.
0316666343|5.0|A lot of people like to dis the hyped - because all of a sudden what was cool becomes too popular and therefore is transferred to the uncool.  I know, I work at a bookstore - I live with the hype.  From THE CORRECTIONS to A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS.  Hype is just that, hype.  So dis all you want, THE LOVELY BONES is an amazing book.  Alice Sebold gives a voice rarely seen in modern fiction - an omnicient narrator whom you know and trust. Sebold has a view and a vision that is lovely.  Plus - her husband is a great author, too.  Check out CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL by Glen David Gold.
B0000047CX|5.0|There is no better music than the bossa-Nova, there is no more stimulating instrument than the saxophone. Here we get the combination of the two: Bossa composed by a master, Jobim, and performed by a master of the sax, Stan Getz. The result is a great, quiet, romantic ... and exciting album.
B000002HEP|5.0|STELLAR. Takes you places. Optimal headphone listening, many layers deep. I have had this since it came out and I am still not sick of it, and I have worn out 2 discs. Spark up a doob and take a trip to Sky Valley...
0064471837|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful. Garth Nix should be applauded for his sheer brilliance. I just got the second one, Lirael, and cannot wait to read it. I am sure it will leave me waiting in agony for number three, Abhorsen. Read it, you definitely won't regret it.
0060005424|5.0|If you enjoyed Sabriel, I encourage you too give Lireal a chance. Garth Nix, has a gift,  bringing the characters to life, leaving you excited for the next book in the trilogy. With strong heroine's this book is full to the brim with the never ending fight versus light and dark, with twists of adventure and romance.
B0000019PA|5.0|Once in a while an album comes along that changes everything you ever thought about pop music. I can think of about ten, including the first Violent Femmes album, Velvet Underground Third, The Flaming Lips'Transmissions from the Satellite Heart, Belle and Seb... oops! better stop boring you with lists. Let's just say that that NMH's second album is the best collection of songs ever committed to plastic. On the first listen I wasn't sure- Jeff's voice can be something of an acquired taste; by the second listen I was intrigued; by the third I was completely hooked. There is so much love and strangeness and wit and melancholy and joy in these grooves. Lyrically and instrumentally, NMH explore uncharted territory; but, whereas most \\"experimental\\" bands are pretty hard on the listener, NMH manage the miracle by making weird things sweet and sweet things weird. I'm babbling a little here, so I won't even attempt a track by track commentary- just buy the album- if it doesn't change your life then your life isn't worth changing.
B00006878K|5.0|This is an exceptional blues album from Albert King. It includes such classics as Born under a bad sign, Oh pretty woman, the hunter, and Laundromat blues.  Buy this album and listen to Albert's guitar sing and then you will recognize why such greats as stevie ray Vaughan and eric clapton site king as a major influence.
B00004XMSN|5.0|The Bishop's Wife. This beautifully directed 1940's black and white Christmas movie is charming and heartwarming.<br />Church Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) wants to build a new and bigger church in the worst way. He is even willing to kowtow to rich demanding congregation members to get funding.  Loretta Young as his lovely and somewhat neglected wife Julia, understands how badly her husband wants his new church but she doesn't want him to forget why he became a Bishop and to remember where his real duties lie. In desperation Henry prays for help and guidance. Help comes to him in form of a handsome, debonair and somewhat irreverent angel named Dudley, played superbly by Cary Grant. Grant arrives and immediately steals the heart of Henry's young daughter as well as the hearts of his secretary, maid and wife. When Henry cancels an appointment to hear young members in his congregation sing, Dudley goes instead. Dudley also encourages Julia to buy a rakish hat she admires, he takes her dining and dancing and wins over the disapproving church members who see them together. It seems that angel Dudley can do no wrong, everyone loves him, except Henry who starts to wonder if Dudley really is an angel and what is  his real purpose here. David Niven as the somewhat uptight Bishop was the right choice for this role.<br />There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie. Dudley magically types letters and stuffs envelopes so Henry's secretary can leave the office early  to do Christmas shopping; he decorates the tree that the fluttering maid (a very young Elsa Lanchester) has just started to trim; and he has taxi driver, James Gleason, ice skating like an Olympic champion. When the boys won't let Julia's daughter play catch because she throws like a girl, Dudley steps in to give her a good pitching arm. Monty Woolley as the Professor who suspects that Dudley is a VERY special person is simply wonderful.<br />This is the perfect story for all faiths.<br />Vannie(~.~)
B00000ILDE|5.0|\\"Aliens\\" is the near perfect sequel to the original \\"Alien\\" movie.  Much of the credit for its excellence must go to James Cameron, who both wrote the screenplay, and also directed, what is generally acknowledged as a classic in the genre... Full of twists and turns, Aliens holds your attention to the very end.<br />This film firmly established the character Ripley as a science fiction icon, and helped define the female action hero.  Like the original, Aliens has a good supporting cast, though perhaps not as distinguished.  Paul Reiser, has probably never done a better job of acting, than he does here in the role of Burke, a pure weasel who ...  Bill Paxson is the soldier Hudson,...  Young actress Carrie Henn is wonderful as Newt.  Michael Biehn, is Hicks, a levelheaded corporal ... Jenette Goldstein makes her film debut as the soldier Vasquez.  And Lance Hendrickson is Bishop, a \\"synthetic\\" you can trust.<br /><br />The special effects hold up rather well, though most of exterior scenes of the planet, buildings, vehicles and ships look a bit dated.  It's interesting to note that radio and video communication, so far in the future, is so poor.  And they still haven't improved those silly proximity meters, the ones that don't tell you where the enemy is until they are on top of you.<br />The special edition DVD contains 17 minutes of additional scenes that flesh out and complete the story.  We learn more about Ripley's daughter, and what happened to the colonists on LV-426.  The background provides insight into Ripley's relationship with Newt.  Also included is an interview with James Cameron, which provides information about the film and also the man.  Aliens SE, while not replete with extras, does provide a completed version of this terrific film.  Your SF collection, would not be complete without this thriller.
B000002VCW|2.0|Maybe it's how it evokes vivid memories of my own coming of age in 1976 but  Stewarts &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; (the song not the record) is worth the price of the disk.  It's always mezermized me, from the opening piano intro to the nylon and elctric guitar solos split in half by that high-proud sax,  then and now whenever I hear it.  It is quite simply, one of the most hauntingly, effortlessly flowing and perfect pieces of music I've ever heard. Track nine surly is his master opus and his finest year.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This Documentary explains the essence of a military combat unit.  Unbelievable historical events wrapped in with a study of the role of the leader and the follower.  The importance of strong military leadership is shown in great detail.  Any Military leadership department better get their hands on this collection.<br />Even without much Air Force involvement Spielberg and Hanks did an amazing job on one chill WWII Documentary flick.
B000021Y77|4.0|Choice of dubbed or subtitled, went with subtitled, and as with all good foreign language films, got into the film enough to not even notice.<BR>The pumping soundtrack drives the film along nicely, the two leads are both very good, and the film is quickly set-up and running.<BR>The twists of fate, are amusing and quirky, and you cant help but finish the film with a grin on your face.
B000069HKH|3.0|With all of the rubbish out there I am not surprised to read reviews like Rolling Stone's that this is Springsteen's latest masterpiece. The truth is, it's a good not great album. Where it is wonderful to hear him re-united with the E Street Band they have not yet rekindled the fire they were once famous for. Melodically there are times when Bruce sounds like Tom Petty which isn't a particularly bad thing but I'm just not accustomed to hearing Bruce remind me of others as he has such an original style. The biggest disapointment however is his lyrics. They are surprisingly superficial, failing to hold one's interest. Lyrics were always Bruce's greatest gift. He had a knack for writing such in-depth material, particularly the character driven story telling, that you felt that you could get inside the head of the characters he would write about. He was a great story teller. Such talents were still clearly evident on Tom Joad which makes it all the more surprising that they are absent here. The Rising does not intend to be, but ends up coming across as a shallow effort. A pity when Springsteen writes of such delicate topics as 9-11 you can't help but hope for more. One of Rock's last great talents delivers a little short of expectations. Maybe next time...Simon
B00005QDW1|5.0|...I was listening to the radio one day, and heard Hey Baby, then weeks later Hella Good. I had liked all of their singles so far, so I decided to give them a shot. And let me say, that now I consider them my favorite band. The cd starts off with some strong singles, and moves on to other great songs. I really love how No Doubt can make a great fast and catchy song, then make some slower ones and they are just as good. Most cd's people buy are pretty good, but aren't excellent. This cd is all good in my opinion. So, if you like previous No Doubt songs and cd's, if I were you I would run out NOW(!!!!!), and buy this cd. NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6305558167|3.0|I've always avoided watching Excalibur because HBO always shows the PG version, and I wanted to see it the way the director wanted it seen. So I was quite excited to get the DVD. And I was sorta disappointed.<br />   The movie looks great, and Director John Boorman gets points for telling the WHOLE story, from the downfall of Arthur's father, Uther, to the rise and fall of Arthur himself. I think the main problem was Nigel Terry, the actor portraying King Arthur- He just didn't seem to have the gravitas for such an epic role, and his pop-eyed look kept making me think I was watching an episode of BlackAdder, or Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Nicol Williamson is a lot of fun, in a campy way, as Merlin, and his scenes with Helen Mirren, the Sorceress Morgana, are great, and made me wish for more of them. The epic battle at the end seemed kind of small-scale, and very rushed, and a main character is impaled, and an instant later the lance is gone, and no one seemed to pull it out. That continuity error really freaked me out.....sloppy! Overall it wasn't such a bad movie, but not such a great one either. To me, John Boorman will always be the man behind The Exorcist II.....Yuck!
014028009X|5.0|This book is brilliant! Hilarious story of Bridget Jones. This story had me laughing out loud (sometimes to my embarassment) whenever and wherever I was reading it. Helen Fielding is a great author and I recommend this novel to anyone of the following : those who enjoyed the movie, those who enjoyed Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, those who like to laugh, and any women. Certainly the funniest book I've ever read. There is a little bit of Bridget Jones in every women. Don't believe me? Read it yourself and you won't be disappointed.
B000002JKA|5.0|An astonishingly solid album. Dream Theater may very well not appeal to all, and it is hard for me to attempt a recommendation here: rest assured if you enjoy rock and metal and do not feel uncomfortable with a measure of intelligence adhering to music then this band is well worth the time to investigate.<br />  This CD is considerably heavier then its predecessors, as well as assuming a more dark, menacing tone which is very welcome. Only 'Innocence Faded' would not seem out of place when viewed beside the material included on 'Images and Words'. The guitar playing is very accomplished technically, although those who prefer more immediacy im music may not enjoy the intricate, lenghty instrumental sections on some of the compositions, or the speed of the halen/Vai esque histrionics. The vocals are decidedly operatic and overwrought in places, yet extremely strong, comprehensible and entirely fitting to the band. The drumming is astounding: Mike Portnoy never ceases to amaze me with the constant level of invention he diplays on his instrument and I speak as a drummer myself. The bass playing and the keyboards both maintain the extremely high level of musicianship.<br />  '6.00' and 'Caught in a web' are both prime slices of hard rock perfection, whilst the extended suite 'A mind beside itself'(including 'Voices') is particularly strong. 'The Mirror' and 'Lie', two of the bands heaviest compositions both evoke strong images of spite and anger throughout, while Petrucci churns out earth shattering riffs effortlessly. 'Lifting shadows off a dream' and 'Space Dye vest' are both more mellow and reflective, unspeakably beautifully in Space Dye vest's case. The 11 minute 'Scarred' provides the albums highlight, including as it does numerous tempo changes and stunning solos.<br />In conclusion, if you enjoy this type of music, this album is a must buy, if you are new to metal and prog in particular it is still a wonderful starting point, but if your musical views are firmly wrought and you dislike this type of band you should avoid like the plague.t and you dislike this type of band you should avoid like the plague.
0613325419|4.0|\\"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them,\\" by Newt Scamander and J.K Rowling, is an interesting companion to the main series of novels.  Telling us about seventy-five animals, this book offers more information on some of the creatures we've seen (the Acromantula and the Basilisk, for example) while offering tantalizing glimpses of what may yet come (I for one would love to see a Nundu or a Lethifold).<br />This book is rather abbreviated (I wish *my* textbooks were this short), and so I can only give it 4 stars.  Still, it's definitely worth the small amount it costs to purchase,...
0789723107|5.0|I found this book really interesting (I'm not a newbie in the area) and well written. I suggest it to everybody aproaching the problem for the first time and even to experienced people.
B000007ODM|2.0|I have a theory as to why most people thoroughly enjoyed this cd, and this is it: the style of music is terrific.  However, this album is mediocre, at best.  <BR>I have listened to Enigma, Delerium, among others, and none of them really gets it.  This is what I mean: the styles are great, and most have a few songs that are terrific.  Enigmas first two albums have a couple of great tunes that you can listen to for many years after.  Their third album was the best of this type of music: spiritual, with a good beat and an attempt at enlightenment.  But their third album doesn't have a song that is as endearing as their first two albums.<BR>Era's first song is terrific, and is the reason I got the cd.  But, after hearing it several times, I don't think it is very good.  The guitar on the latter songs is good, but it still isn't right.  <BR>My opinion is that we want to enjoy this kind of music, and make these albums greater than they really are.  But, if you really want to get it right, if you are looking for a cd that will be great for meditation and contemplation, this is not the cd to get!  Peter Gabriel's Passion is where you should hold the standard, and Era's cd does not come close to the inspiration and emotion Passion creates.
B00004VVNB|4.0|We just saw Logan's Run on Tv tonight. It was incredible. I don't think I had seen it since some 1977 \\"Late Night Movie World Premiere\\" or other, and I don't think I ever watched the whole thing. I was blown away! It uses a lot of intricate, detailed, and spectacular sets and artwork that still look impressive, even after Blade Runner and \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />I saw some similarities to Star Wars. For example, in some cases the characters walk thru large open corridors with mirror like black floors. This looked like some of the hallways in the Death Star. \\"Box\\" (a robot) had a head that looked similar to C-3P0's head.<br />The soundtrack features a lot of avant-garde style analog synthesizer music with instruments in the style of Moog and Arp. I don't find that style appealing, personally, but students of electronic music might be interested in studying what must be one of the last and therefore most advanced examples of that style. After the incredible soundtrack of Star Wars, (which featured a conventional, symphonic style), we probably never heard that electronic style again.<br />Michael York blew me away with his excellent performance, and I was charmed by Peter Ustinov's comical role.<br />Some of the special effects were lame, and that's really a shame after some of the others were so excellent. I'm watching the movie and my jaw is dropping in awe of various scenes, and then comes the scene where they meet Box and some rocks fall. That part was so fake looking. There were other problems as well, but that's no reason to avoid this movie and miss the excellent stuff.<br />The story was well paced and reasonably interesting. The social commentary has aged well and for me hasn't lost much of it's shock value.  I guess the theme of over-population can't lose shock value.<br />This movie to me looked far more elaborate then \\"Soylent Green,\\" I don't know why it doesn't enjoy more fame than that movie.<br />Recommended!
B0000640SA|3.0|Movie itself deserves 5 stars, it is an original movie, casting is good and it really entertains for about two hours. But this is a limited edition, packing case was supposed to be a collector's item, but in fact it's horrible, paper is very fragile and discs are kept inside so tight that it's pretty hard to take them out. Also design is poor. It's probably the worst DVD case I've seen. For instance I compare this case with Fight Club's case or X Files Complete Season's case (any of the 5 available collections by the moment). Even though those cases are made of paper (as Memento's one) those are real collector editions, great design and quality. But Memento,... it really disappointed me. Then I gave the case -2 stars, that's the reason for my 3 stars to this edition.
0441172717|5.0|For me, finishing Dune was like walking out of a great movie with a smile on my face thinking, &quot;Damn, that was good.&quot;  I'm not a regular reader of science fiction, but I can see why the cover proclaims it &quot;Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece.&quot;  Herbert combines politics, religion, strategy, psychology, intelligence, and emotion inside an incredibly detailed and seemingly tangible universe.<br />Despite the alien environment, Dune is a book that drew me in instantly, and didn't let me go until the end.  Herbert's writing style was a joy to read, as he managed to find the delicate balance between detail and brevity, resulting in a fluid tale with both depth and raw emotion.  What makes books like Dune and the Lord of the Rings series so great is that their respective worlds seem completely natural and real to the reader.  Add some great action, plot twists, and wonderfully fleshed out characters, and you have a masterpiece of not just science fiction, but modern literature as well.  The incredible epic of the Muad'Dib, the deadly beauty of Arrakis and its inhabitants ... Dune is a novel I will never forget.
B000066I6N|5.0|Robert Plant contiunes to shine on his new disc Dreamland.  Plant is so comfortable in his skin and on this disc that nothing seems  rushed or placed for comercialism.  This is a disc that Robert Plant wanted to make.  Plants voice, the way he turns a phrase, the way he ends a verse, is so comfortable to the listener that dreamland is like a letter from a lost friend.<br />Led Zeppelin thrives on its own and it pleases me to know that Robert Plant needs not return to that crutch... Jimmy Page is the  keeper of that flame...<br />If only Robert did not make us wait so long between his projects...
B000021Y7X|5.0|David Byrne and crew offer an earnest performance. Great for the metabolism of the mind. Rock videos don't get better; Byrne has never been more intense; entertainment can't get healthier than this. <br />And if they are still offering a set, do get the other video -- &quot;True Stories&quot; -- as well.  Both films are wonderful.
B00005BKZJ|3.0|As odd as it this film is, it's hard too dismiss it or dislike it. The story is so unique. I've never really seen another film quite like it.  Good performances all around. This is one of those films that isn't really for everyone. But even if you watch it and it turns out it's far from one of your favorites... Well, I doubt you'll regret it. This film is too vibrant, one of those films that's just impossible to dislike.
0792842723|5.0|When Pierce assumed his role as the legendary 007 wit (or at least half of it.....) I was a little worried.  I think Sean Connery was excellent, along with Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and (to some extent) George Lazenby.  But, to tell you the honest truth, he was just as good, if not better.  He definitely has THE bond look and he tries to have fun, is a ladies man, loves fast cars and gambling.  The story rocks!  It is about a rogue MI6 agent who is stealing money electronically, while threatening the world with two sattelites in orbit around the earth.  These sattelites can fire on any point in the earth and it is up to 007, along with the devastating Natalya Simonova, to destroy the sattelites and apprehend the agent.  It's action packed, has a good story, excellent stunts and a great score (despite the other stories of a terrible score).  This is a must buy, especially for beginners in the Bond craze.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is without a doubt powerful, effective movies ever made. De Niro plays Bickle, a NY cab driver with stark reality. All actors are dead on target, including Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel. Bickle gets sick of the people he sees around him and takes it upon himself to rid the world of these people. The climax of the film is one of the most intense in all of film's history, as well as one of the most brilliantly filmed. Taxi Driver is not only an aestetically pleasing movie, but also one of those that will have you pondering about it well afterward.
B00005B3Z5|4.0|I watched the first series of QAF when it aired in the UK and it was pretty ground breaking stuff over here. This was mainly due to the gritty storylines and its 'no holes barred' approach. I loved the series as it was refreshing to see gay storylines that weren't all about HIV and queer bashing (which is all you got previously on british TV). I disagree with some of the other reviewers as I thought it was really well acted and the casting was fantastic.<BR>The american QAF has just started to be aired on cable over here and I found it a little disappointing though still enjoyable. Me and many of my mates were really excited when we heard HBO were releasing an american version. Even Russell T Davies (the writer of britsh QAF) hailed it as fantastic. Yes the actors are much more attractive and there's more nudity and better sex scenes, but if thats all you want from a series, go and get some porn. If you can't watch TV without needing to be titilated the brish series is probably not for you. I personally prefer the series because its not so 'fluffy' and makes you question your own opinions and ideas of gay life. It had to be rougher cause thats life in the UK - no one here would of been able to relate to the beauty of QAF USA. Maybe a british audience expect different things to an american audience. It also appealed to a huge sraight following here because it wasn't incredibly homo-erotic.<BR>If you enjoy good, gritty drama as opposed to lighter, sweeter, more attractive TV, I think you'll like the series a lot. QAF USA is good and has its place but in my mind doesn't equal this series.
6304240554|5.0|I think the first film is better. But this film isn't too far off. So often hollywood quickly makes brainless sequels that serve as nothing more than too make money off the popularity of the first. However, this film is an exception. It can stand on it's own. We take off from the first one. As at the end of the first one, we still believe we will triumph over the zombies. The plot of this movie is that two swat team members, a helicopter pilot, and a tv anchor decid too hole up in a mall...while trying too avoid the zombies. You grow attached to the charachters, and wish them well. This film ends up being a commentary on humanity, specifically greed. This is truly a great film. By the end we get the feeling that the zombies population is about the same as ours. We still hope that they will be beaten.
0316666343|5.0|This book was so moving that I could only discribe it as 'haunting'. You feel for every character in the novel because you can really empathize with what everyone is going through. It also makes you wonder about the afterlife.If you have lost someone dear to you it uplifts your soul too know that they are being taken care of in heaven and that one day you will join them there, but first you have to continue with your life on earth. It is a sad but deeply moving book. I would recommend it to Teens and adults alike.
B000069CWE|2.0|Linkin Park came in from nowhere and amazed with their 2000 multiplatium effort, Hybrid Theory. For the past two and a half years, they have toured nonstop with only about 14 songs to play.<br />I think I speak for all LP fans, that we'd rather have a new, FULL album than another dozen tours. Hybrid Theory barely had forty minutes of music on it. Not enough to warrent at least SIX tours and festivals.<br />Unfortunetly, the sophomore CD is nothing more than a collection of re mixes. I must point out that most bands don't put out remix albums untill well into their career. Usually their dying days. The band says that the reason that Reanimation was made was to hold over their fans untill their \\"real\\" second CD. I say that they shouldn't have wasted time on this and gotten right to the second. An album takes no more than six months to make, and Reanimation probably took about four or five.<br />As for the album itself, it's almost entirly new. The metal element is almost totally erased, and the hip-hop element is front and center. This has alienated the bands core audience, as most metal and rap fans are purists and won't touch anything else.<br />I like rap, actually. Canadian and hardcore (Eminem, Ice Cube,) are my favorites. Some of the selections here are very good, like \\"Points of Authority\\", a remix I prefer to the original, and the remix of \\"My December,\\" also quite good.<br />All in all, if you want to try something new, or are a Linkin Park fan, by all means, buy this. If you are new to the band, try Hybrid Theory instead. You will not regret it.
B00005MP58|5.0|In a world where most books are chopped to pieces when turned into film, it is refreshing to see a movie that takes the time to tell the whole story.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few places where the story deviates from the book, but these places are few and far between.<br />Jennifer Ehle plays an excellent Elizabeth Bennet, with all the wit and compassion one who has read the book would expect.  And Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy is the best I've ever seen, and I've seen many.<br />I would definitely recommend this to romance-lovers and Austen-lovers alike!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes have really caught a timeless moment of the New york life style in Is This It. The album magnifies the love julian feels and the hurt he takes from those god awful relationships. Even though the concept for these doesn't seem to be very initiative, the melodies and riffs are very experimental with the punk sound and the way not just a punk band can sound but a real rock and roll band. They don't act like all those stuck \\"no-good\\" fake \\"rockstars\\" who could care less for the way they sound over how they look.  The point to make music in the first place is because the people making it have passion for it and how can someone bash someone else for having passion. It's put together and put together well no matter how you look at it. Of course maybe they're aren't breaking any walls but that's because they're all broken. And we should be thankful that a band like this with this attitude and this music got exposure to the mainstream because real rock may get the attention it deserves. The album is a centerpiece to any rock listeners collection of music. Don't just take my word for it, listen to it, the music speaks for itself.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Gosford Park, but I think that this was in part because I enjoy the slower, character-focused movies just as much as I enjoy action movies.<br />If you are buying this because it is a murder mystery...don't.  That's why I bought it, and I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that the murder is a subplot.  The murder didn't take place until about an hour and twenty minutes into the movie.<br />On the whole, however, I really like this movie and would reccommend it to others...but only others who like this type of movie.
B00005JKNF|3.0|GOSFORD PARK is a solid piece of moviemaking, even if its'  not director Robert Altman's best work.  Alot of the blame, I think, lies with the plot, which isn't fleshed out much, leaving much of the acting talent to rely on snappy dialogue built around a somewhat hollow shell.  Though it's touted as an Agatha  Christie-style murder mystery, the murder itself doesn't even happen until well into the movie, and the movie has moved so slowly up to that point that it almost seems like just another irrelevant (lack of) plot point.  On the plus side, as with most Altman films, the acting is top-drawer, highlighted by the brilliance of both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren(in the film's finest performance).  Overall, GOSFORD PARK is pretty good, again far from Altman's best, and ultimately highly overrated.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Yes I'm one of those people who didn't see this amazing film up until just now.  And it is truly amazing.  I think about it quite a lot and it's been about two weeks since I've seen it.  No doubt that John Nash was a true mathematical genius, but he was also an extrodinary human being, as was his wife Alicia.  I say this because of the mental illness and the disease they both had to and have to live with.  It's an amazing testament to them both that they survive day to day with this......and this film alone does not do justice to that, but gives us a glimpse into that world.  <br />Ron Howard and Brian Grazer's personal journey to bring this to the screen is important. The DVD extras are wonderful, from the deleted scenes to makeup to music to meeting John Nash himself.  This is a DVD to definitely cherish in your library.  <br />But what haunts me most and why I'm glad I own this is because I need to watch it again.  I need to see what I couldn't see the first time.  Please watch this and try to understand what I can't begin to tell you.  Truly deserving of the Oscar it received, I hope you enjoy this magnificent film.
B00005JL3A|2.0|RESIDENT EVIL is one of those movies you go into knowing that you won't get much out of other than a little dumb fun.  Unfortunately, you don't get much of that here either, thanks  to a razor-thin plot and alot of idea-snatching from superior films. The plot revolves around a company called the Umbrella Corporation, which does illegal viral research in an underground facility called the Hive, which in turn is monitored by an artificial intelligence component called the Red Queen.  After  a security breach, the Red Queen activates a defense mechanism in which all the Hive employees are trapped and summarily killed in the facility.  At this point a tactical unit is dispatched to investigate, and that's where the so-called fun begins.  Again, a movie like this is never known for its' character development or acting range, in which case Milla Jovovich acquits herself admirably in the lead role, looking sufficiently (hacked) off when the scene calls for it.  Michelle Rodriquez does another one of her always-looks-mad-as-hell routines, which seems to be all she's good for and is frankly getting tiresome in every movie that she's in.  All in all, video game afficionados would be better served renting TOMB RAIDER or even one of the MORTAL KOMBAT films. For typical movie-goers, I'd say pass.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Well it starts out interesting enough when his fiance gets murdered and he builds his time machine to go back in time to change this horrible accident.  But then it just goes a little haywire.  What I mean is that he goes forward in time to figure out why he can't change the past....sounds good, but he goes WAY forward in time.  And this is a place that no movie's ever been to and now I know why.  <br />Guy Pearce is good, not great, maybe another actor could have held me through the movie better, but it's just the second half of this movie that's got me in a state of fluster.  Best part I must say was Jeremy Irons, though he never ceases to amaze.<br />Still interesting, the concept of time travel is a complete mystery, and this movie won't solve it any time soon.
1587990717|4.0|A self-described \\"intellectual snob,\\" Nassim Taleb proves it in his elaborate, sarcastic, high-handed writing style, which is still highly readable.  Taleb reminds me of a mild version of one of Jack Vance's characters from the Dying Earth story cycle, with his amusingly archaic, formal style always concealing a dagger for his enemies.  Half the fun is his outrageousness.<br />The other half of the fun is not as much fun, though.  Taleb's mission is to remind us that although we can find ex post facto explanations for anything, we really are not very good at predicting the future.  This affects his field of financial trading even more than it does the lives of the general public.  He points out that with incomplete information (and information is always incomplete), it is impossible to tell whether a given strategy is successful because it is a good one or because so many thousands of strategies are out there that it stands to reason, even if none of them are any good, that some of them by chance will have succeeded by having a \\"one in thousands\\" stroke of luck.  Thus, past performance, practically worshipped as a future predictor, is not as reliable as we would like to think.  This is as hard a message to internalize as it is important that we should do so.<br />Naturally, as a trader himself who is advertising for his own fund, Taleb claims to have beaten this problem but won't tell us how.  But he does not belabor this, instead impressing over and over in different ways how unsuited the human animal is to dealing with probabilities and urging us to make this part of our calculations.  He gives entertaining and convincing examples of the fallacies he sees every day in business and the bases for them in human behavior.<br />Especially in finance, healthy skepticism is very important, but rarely encouraged.  Taleb's book is a valuable exception to this rule.  It's an easy, fun, informative read, and more people should read it than probably will.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I didn't get it. Anyway what this movie trying to say ??<BR>I can't believe I sit and watch this movie about over two hours.<BR>What was the plot about ?
0425180638|1.0|After reading the Kay Scarpetta series over the years I've finally decided I've had enough. The last good book in the series was &quot;From Potter's Field&quot;. Anything since then has been junk. Everytime I buy one of Cornwell's new books I hope that her writing and imagination will be as good as she was in her early days, but she has lost it. The Last Precinct is basically her feelings on lesbianism, not homosexuality, but lesbianism. She's really trying to push the issue with her readers, and that is not why I read her novels. I suppose Kay Scarpetta will come out of the closet soon. No thanks....There are plenty of other good authors out there to choose from, although I will miss the old Kay Scarpetta. The Last Precinct was the last straw for me.
B00006AVRK|5.0|On the surface this is a series of stories about a bumbling upper class British bachelor who is rescued from social predicaments by his valet.  The story is set in the inner war years.  There are frequently seemingly unrelated subplots that come together at the last minute to effect the rescue.<br /> Underneath is a satire of the foibles of human nature.  The characters are exaggerated archetypes.  They are played by people who are cast to match the character and give the impression that they are snickering under their breath as the play the part to the hilt.  I suspect that rehearsals were a riot.  <br />The only problem is that the series was filmed over four years and the players for some parts changed. In general, I prefer the first person to play each part and I get the \\"Who is that imposter pretending to be person X?\\" reaction to the new players.
0140386335|5.0|This was one of the first fantasy books I picked up (besides the Harry Potter series), and I fell in love with it right from he first page. Although there have been three decent movies, the book is far superior. <br />An elementary school boy named Bastian Balthizar Bux runs into an old bookstore after some bullies chase him. He takes \\"The Neverending Story\\" out of the shop and returns home to read it (I'm not promoting skipping school) <br />The ruler of the Empire of Fantastica, where all stories and dreams become reality) has been diagnosed with a disease that has baffled even the five hundred greatest doctors in Fantastica. It is up to Atreyu, a courageous warrior to find a way to cure the Empress. <br />Bastian thinks that what he is reading is just a story, but when things start getting emotional, he starts having an inner conflict with himself. <br />Later, Bastian finds himself in Fantastica, and learns that Sorceress Xayide, themost powerful in the realm is taking away his memories. Bastian must learn who he really is...<br />What's so cool about the book vs. the movies i there are about 7 chapters in the book that aren't even mentioned in the movie. The book is very imaginative, with excellent imagery. The book also provides a wealth of opportunity for writing fan fiction (in many of the chapters, the words \\"but that's another story, and it shall be told another time\\" appear, stretching the imagination. The book is 400+ pages (my version was only 380), but it seems like there could have been a thousand. This book will go by so fast, because you will be absorbed in it. <br />Kudos to Michael Ende! 5/5
6301976983|5.0|It's tough to decide what Humphrey Bogart's best film is, but this one is definitely in the top three, along with The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, ranked by the American Film Institute as #30 on their all-time greatest films list, is a truly wonderful film that offers, in addition to two hours of great entertainment, some real insights on greed an how gold can turn a relatively innocent bum into a manatically suspicious and dangerous man.<br />Basically, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is about Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), who is stuck in a small town in Mexico, broke. That changes when he wins a substantial prize in the lottery. Sick of his poverty-stricken life, Bogart decides to go searching for gold in the mountains. He teams up with a friend and an older and more experienced man, and the three pool their savings, buy equipment, and set off to hunt for the treasure of the Sierra Madre.<br />Anyhow, as surprising as it is given his image and his appeal as a box-office star, Bogart intentionally made his character become increasingly diagreeable as the film progressed, proving that the old man, who had spoken about the effect of gold on mens' souls before they set out, was right in his prediction.<br />Bogart's performance is truly brilliant, regardless of the fact that it may have bothered audiences when the film was first released, leading to its failure at the box-office. Additionally, the film benefits from an insightful script, a great director, and wonderful shots of the actual Sierra Madre mountains (it was filmed on location). So, from the very beginning to the masterful, ironic final shots, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a true classic in every sense of the word! See it and enjoy!
B000002L9W|5.0|I must say, I was a little hesitant to buy this CD, but I am a huge VH (especially the Roth years) and Steve Vai fan.  I bought it expecting 30 minutes of Roth being Roth, in a bad way.  I was right, but in a good way.  Roth and Vai's songwriting is very mature.  It evolves from the balls-out rocking of &quot;Yankee Rose&quot; and &quot;Shy Boy&quot; to the slow funk and soul of &quot;Ladies' Nite in Buffalo?&quot; and &quot;Big Trouble&quot;.  &quot;Big Trouble&quot; also showcases one of the most fantastic guitar solos my ears have ever had the pleasure of listening to.  &quot;Elephant Gun&quot; is plain awesome (it's got a cool bass solo from the phenomenal Billy Sheehan and an awesome chorus), and &quot;Bump and Grind&quot; is what you'd expect from Roth.  The only song that's below par is &quot;Goin' Crazy&quot;.  Even though it's still pretty good.  Even the covers are great. Roth's rendition of Sinatra's &quot;That's Life&quot; is even a nice little guilty pleasure at the end of the CD.  Overall, the musicianship is great (those funk riffs absolutely rock), the hooks are quite hooky, and Roth is in top shape.
B000069HKH|4.0|..Lets keep it in perspective. He hasn't done much in the<BR>last several years. A live CD, a greatest hits package, an average folk album, ect. I mean he's 52 years old and the guys trying to raise 3 kids. Music may not be at the top of this multi-millionairs list anymore. Still there is a lot to recommend on &quot;The Rising&quot;. The title track for one. &quot;Marys Place&quot; (an awful title, but this song would fit on any of his early Cd's). &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot;. There are others but all and all not a bad CD though in no way is this worth all the hype that magazines like Rolling Stone and Time are giving it. Though I've always thought that Springsteens mom must own Rolling Stone. In the end, if your a fan you will like this CD. If you are buying this to find out what all the fuss is about it might be worth your money but don't be upset if doesn't live up to it all.
0743442539|4.0|This is the book that really launched Le Carre's career as a writer.  It displays all the qualities that make his work attractive.  The subtle presentation of the complicated and surprising plot makes a very unlikely series of events seem natural.  The character development is superb with real psychological insight and rigorous attention to detail.  The quality of writing is excellent and miles above the usual standard of thrillers.  Animating this book and all his best books are concerns with substantial moral issues.  Do the ends justify the means?  If so, then what amount of betrayal and deception is acceptable?  If both sides in conflict like the Cold War employ the same immoral methods, is there a real difference between them?  Finally, what are the moral and personal costs of using these methods, even in an apparently good cause?  Le Carre posed these questions in the context of stories about the small world of espionage, but they apply equally well to many facets of national policy during the Cold War.
B000002WYT|5.0|Ok, as much publicity and fanaticism as Dave Matthews has generated, you'd expect them to fall short of the amazing critical acclaim they constantly receive. Oh no, my friend! Dave never ceases to amaze me, even though i've listened to this CD a million times. This is one of my favorites because it includes so many of the classic, cherished, favorite songs like &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot; and of course &quot;Crash&quot;. Buy this if you've just started listening to Dave, because if you're a long-time fan, I know you already own this album.
0316666343|4.0|This book reminded me of the Robin Williams movie, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; It was a very creative look at heaven. It was comforting to know that Susie wasn't in pain, that she was around her family. They knew she was there, they could feel her. It got a little strange in one part, but if you liked the movie &quot;Ghost&quot; you will be okay with that part.<BR>I like to be able to get lost in a book and this book did it for me.
B000001FDQ|4.0|Yngwie Malmsteen's debut as a solo artist is quite a masterful piece of music that doesn't lose it's intensity.  Even when it quiets to a whisper.  The instrumental \\"Black Star\\" is absolutely an epic in itself.  \\"Icarus's Dream Suite Op.4\\" is absolutely the best track, it starts with power chordage, then Yngwie plays subtle leads and breaks into the acoustic guitars, then finally explodes into an icredible piece that definitely shows Yngwie has the guts, the chops, and the heart to be called \\"Virtuoso\\".  The only weak spots on the album are actually the ones with singing.  They aren't bad or anything, they're filled with the classical style of singing that is incorporated into Yngwie's music for the years ahead, they just don't stand well next to the real musical treats on the album.<BR>\\"Far Beyond the Sun\\" and \\"Evil Eye\\" are other great tracks as well.
B000060P79|5.0|I was never into punk rock before I heard Simple Plan. Now I'm an all out punk rocker. Their album is incredible and basically tells the story of my life. I like it because I can relate to almost all of their songs and their sound is great. Not to mention their lead singer, Pierre, is so hot! I can't wait for them to come out with a new album. Everyone should own &quot;No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls&quot;
B00005YW4H|4.0|My cousin David is visiting and he heard the music playing at a local ... store and was really intrigued by her music. He asked if he, my brother and I would all pitch in and buy a copy with him and share it. So, we did so, and I am giving it my first listen today. I think she has a wonderful voice, and it definetly is smooth, cool, and silky, but I wish just a bit more she could linger her voice a little longer on some notes where it seems appropriate. Otherwise, I feel she is going places.
B000066NW0|4.0|First off, the only things Avril and Brittney have are they are both in the rock/pop category and they are both young.  Brittney is much more pop, and sings, dances, and looks pretty.  I complement Avril for writing her own songs and being pure to herself.  Her songs come from the heart, and she knows how to rock.  I wouldn't consider her music style in the sk8r category, but she definately has the attitude.<br />I would compare her more to such performers as 4 Non-Blondes, Sheryl Crow, and Jewel.  And I think her future lies in being seen in their category and with a slightly older audience than Brittney.  If she's able to keep up with the times without selling out, I believe she will have a great lifelong career ahead of her.<br />The album sounds great.  Keep it up, girl!
0345350499|5.0|Like I said you must read this book, Morgaine (Morgan Le Fay) has always been portrayed as Arthurs evil half sister, in this book however you relise that that is just not true she is only trying to keep the old worship of the Goddess alive.This book enchanted and facsinated me so much I read it 3 times and living very near to both Glastonbury and Cadbury castle I visited both and felt as if I could see the life of Morgaine and the tragedy that is Artur and Camelot. All in all the best book I have ever read!
B0000683DH|5.0|The most important Star Trek film to own on any media.  The one that sums up Star Trek in 2 hours.  This DVD edition just kicks it up a few hundred notches.<br />As a 2nd generation Star Trek fan, I was just a small child when Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan was originally released.  Of course I enjoyed the battle scenes (the most of any Star Trek movie) and stuff blowing up and raising the shields, blah blah blah.  I was shocked when Spock died at the end and of course being so young had not understood the whole idea of &quot;anything can happen ... just wait for the sequel.&quot;<br />When I grew up, I bought the original movie VHS set that originally included the first five motion pictures.  Of course &quot;Khan&quot; was the one I kept digging out and watching again and again.<br />After the Next Generation had their success both on television and on the big screen, I admit I hadn't watched this movie in years ... until this DVD came out.<br />Not only is the audio cleaned up, the video excellent and several scenes added in (it's a Director's Edition of course) but it has several hours of additional interviews and other goodies.  Even if you don't see the need to repurchase this movie as you have it on VHS, I would buy it anyway just for that.<BR>Just being told that several cast members didn't even want to make another movie after the first one but made this one anyway is a tribute to how good the project was/is.  It wasn't about money.  It was about making something they could believe in.<br />I never understood the significance of &quot;Khan&quot; on every future Star Trek project until I watched this DVD.  It indeed is amazing how it nearly resurrected Star Trek and set the tone for now 2 decades of Star Trek goodness.<br />So not only is it the coolest, most action packed of all Star Trek movies but it has stood the test of time, as it included everything we started watching Star Trek in the first place for.<br />If you're a Star Trek fan, go buy it NOW.If you're not a Star Trek fan and never understood why so many people think it's such a big deal, buy it anyway.  If you rent it first, you'll just be wasting your money.<br />Yeah, it's that good.
B00006690G|4.0|Eminem's newest album \\"the eminem show\\" is not quite as good as<BR>the marshall matheres lp but it is worth buying. Eminem shows us<BR>in this album how cruel and kind he can be. Haillie's song is very sweet(it is to his daughter haillie jade). Without me, cleaning out my closet, til I collapse are the best songs on this album but there is several other good ones. Eminem really <BR>breaks down alot about his life and the criticism he gets. Overall a good album def worth giving a chance.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Resident Evil is the kind of movie I like to watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  Or any night of the week after 11pm when I'm too tired to think anymore.  It's like watching a really cool video game without all the work of actually playing it.<br />I loved this movie!  Based on the video game of the same name, it gives you all the zombie killing fun that I can only assume the game does (I've never played it but I've seen commercials for it on T.V.)  <br />In the secret underground lab of the Umbrella Corporation, illegal genetic and chemical weapons experiments are being conducted.  One of the experimental agents is released in the facility and the A.I. enhanced super-computer that monitors the lab decides that the only way to contain the \\"accident\\" is to lock down the building and terminate the hundreds of researchers who have been exposed.  The company then sends in a special forces team to disable the computer and discover the reason for the disaster.  Once inside the team discovers that the A.I. is in control, the researchers have all become flesh eating zombies and  the genetic experiments have broken out of their cages.  <br />Milla Jovovich, aka Leeloo from The Fifth Element, plays Alice, a special forces agent in a sexy evening gown with short term amnesia, who is found in the house above the lab complex and taken in with the team to secure the facility.  The only other actor of name is Michelle Rodriguez (Girl Fight, The Fast and the Furious) as one of the special forces soldiers.  Both women do a great job of running around blasting zombies and acting cool. <br />The special effects are really good.  The zombies are your basic slow moving, ever advancing, impossible to kill without a head shot variety.  The mutated killer dogs are scary and look real, but the CGI genetic mutants are disappointing.  Kinda like the stone warriors from the based on a video game movie Tomb Raider.  The 3-D computer maps of the facility that pop up periodically to show you where the characters are is a neat effect as well. <br />I was very pleased with this movie.  It was exactly what I expected it to be and the perfect waste of a Saturday afternoon.
B0000009SM|5.0|This was the first Zappa album I bought as a teenager in 1975 after being turned on to some of the Flo & Eddie (1971) era Mothers. It was my first Zappa purchase and still among my favorite.<BR>I soon after began purchasing every album.<BR>Inca Roads begins the album strong and long, although as a composition doesn't drag the way most lengthy rock songs from the same era did. I cite such \\"get your butt kicked at a party if you turn the song off\\" tunes as Green Grass And High Tides Forever and Freebird.<BR>The reason I call this the LAST great Zappa album is because there really aren't any throw-away tracks on it. Many later releases featured an opening track that Zappa perhaps tried to put in to be possibly radio-friendly. This album didn't go for any of that. Just pure musicianship performed by Frank and what many consider his best band, the \\"Roxy-era Mothers\\". <BR>Although this sounds like a studio album, Inca Roads and Florentine Pogen were live performances for the KCTV television special in 1974. <BR>The engineering skill that Zappa possessed made the album sound so clean that you wouldn't even know that it was live recording. To attest to the editing skills of Zappa one needs to listen to the ORIGINAL version of Inca Roads (video of the KCTV program) for two reasons: <BR>1. The track, starting with George Duke singing, sounds much better on the album release than in its raw form. Zappa tweeked the knobs to improve George's voice to great result and,<BR>2. The guitar solo from Inca Roads actually was spliced in from the performance of the song from a different concert. That being the Helsinki concert which is released on You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore, Vol. 2. The same solo is on both One Size Fits All and the aforementioned Stage, Vol. 2 but, again, a little editing from the master engineer brought the solo a little tighter and a little brighter!<BR>As for Evelyn, A Modified Dog: The song harkens back to the pedal-depressed resonance of the people inside the piano of the Lumpy Gravy album of 1967. A little bit of nostalgia for the old folks. <BR>The original version of Florentine Pogen (live as mentioned earlier) is, unfortunately, edited before the band really takes it away and features a great guitar solo by Frank. You wouldn't miss it only knowing from the CD anyway, but knowing how the band played on makes you wish it were left intact for the album release.<BR>Pojama People features more blistering Zappa guitar work and Andy features some of my favorite drumming on a Zappa album. The shifting time signatures which only his band members could handle with such precision makes it a Zappa classic!<BR>There are many GREAT Zappa albums. This was perhaps the LAST of the greatest.
6302816580|1.0|Some films you watch and wonder how anyone could enjoy something like this much less write it.  Then, you see a review above yours that gives it five stars and you're even more confused.<br />Basically, Over the Top is your typical bad 80s movie with everything that makes most people hate them and a few sad people love them.  Perhaps the best way to describe it would be to say that it's a bad action movie without the action.  It features all the awful acting, utterly ludicrous plot, and corny direction that make these films a genre to themselves. However, instead of the excessive gunfights that would be in your average 80s action flick, here you have arm wrestling.  No guns or explosions are to be found here.  Instead, you get too guys holding hands and grunting for and incredibly long time.<br />This is truely one film where I'm utterly baffled as to how anyone could like it.  There is not a single redeeming aspect of it.  This is really one of those films that the only way you can enjoy it is to feel superior to it.
B00005QDW1|3.0|No doubt use to be a band that played ska type music, However this album is a dance/digital album. Hey baby, hella good, get you up and dancing and songs like underneath it all are slow but a decent song nonetheless. I prefer no doubts' old music style but this works, It shows their music can change but the band still sounds good. I say it is worth buying.
B000005E60|3.0|Listening to this recorded muddle of Berio's masterpiece sent me back to my old Columbia LP with the Swingle Singers and The New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein. If Sony classical had the good sense to re issue the SUPERLATIVE Bernstein performance it would blow this poorly miked,unbalanced, unispired powder puff right out of the water. The recording engineers did Berio great disservice undermiking/mixing the orchestra here and adding hall ambiance to the New Swingle Singers voices. It sounds like it was recorded in a barn with a Jr High School PA System. Once you've ever heard the Bernstein you will find this performance offensive. Boulez, despite his reputation for avantgarde music, clearly misses the mark on this one.
0316666343|5.0|I cannot believe that people have actually reviewed this book with one star and some have not been able to read it all of the way through!  I read it in three nights.  It is amazing to read a book from the perspective of someone who has passed-on instead of people on earth.  The heaven that is portrayed is the heaven I would like to have exist and reminds me of the movie \\"What Dreams May Come\\" with Robin Williams.  Ms. Sebold's first novel is breathtaking and even though it deals with some harsh realities such as rape and murder, I feel it is written so that those tragedies do not become the principal focus of the novel but rather the feelings and emotions of the characters are the most important things.
B000001F7R|5.0|You might think I'm going out on a limb to say this is a better album than High 'N' Dry, Pyromania, or Hysteria. And in a lot of ways you couldn't be more right. But, let's have a look at this and their other 3 good albums and see what is wrong with them:<br />-High 'N' Dry: Good album, but unfortunately enough it only produced a single hit (Bringin' On The Heartbreak.) Also, this was the first album to feature Joe Elliott's voice being used in the same manner it is today. However, such a fast change of vocal stylings really makes the album sound akward at places. <br />-Pyromania: Great album, the best just behind On Through The Night. Four hits (Photograph, Too Late For Love, Rock Of Ages, Foolin') were produced here, as well as six other incredible tracks, including the masterpiece Comin' Under Fire. What's wrong with this album, you ask? WAY TOO COMMERCIAL. The band had changed its sound considerably just to draw in an audience. Also, this is Phil Collen's first album. He's just as good as Pete Willis, but sadly Collen alone is one of the major reasons Def Leppard became a pop band in the nineties.<br />Hysteria: Good album overall, but even more commercial than Pyromania. Sure it spawned an unheard-of seven hits, but by now the band altered its sound so much just to please fans that they were beginning to sound extremely akward at times (listen to Pour Some Sugar On Me and then any song from On Through The Night and you'll se what I mean.) Also, Love Bites was the track that would transform their awesome \\"gloom and doom\\" ballads into sappy and mediocre romantic ones.<br />Now let's look at On Through The Night:<BR>-Here the band isn't the least bit concerned with commercial appeal, meaning this is the only album that features them in their most original sound.<BR>-There's something here to please EVERYONE! If you like fast-paced hard rock Rocks Off is for you. Van Halen fan? Then you're gonna love It Don't Matter. Like songs that are lighter and more melodic, but still rock and roll? Check out Hello America. Want a slow, gloomy track that sounds NOTHING like later Def Leppard? Sorrow Is A Woman is right up your alley. Prefer a psychedelic approach to your hard rock. Give Satellite a listen. Want a lengthy epic track that never fails to please? Look no further than the Overture. <BR>-The price. On average this is less expensive than any other Def Leppard album!<BR>-The cover is the only place you'll see the original Def Leppard logo.<br />When I say this is Def Leppard's best album I am not kidding. Don't get me wrong, it may take some time to get into, but I can assure you this is their best overall.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I love this entire soundtrack, but what I'd really like to comment on is the music at the end of track 13, \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\".  Since I read all three parts of the book before viewing the movie, I knew that Gandalf is going to come back to life.  But everything about the scene just after he falls into the abyss nearly makes you forget that, and the genuis of Howard Shore's music in particular.  I couldn't believe how perfect it was.  The emotion was great, and people around me in the theatre who obviously hadn't read the book were dismayed to see Gandalf die.  In a movie with death everywhere, it may have been hard to evoke that kind of shocked emotion, but Shore's music worked perfectly.
6305752672|5.0|This is proably the best ppv ive seen in wrestling, every match was good or great.My favourite matches are in order,Chris Benoit vs Rick Steiner,Goldberg vs Sid,DDP vs Ric Flair.I know the order of my matches doesnt make sense with my title but sid and goldberg did steal the show but i stilled liked the Benoit ,steiner match with Dean Malenko doing what did in the ppv.Anyway this video is the best so buy it for the blood of the sid match and the great matches.
B00005QK3W|1.0|I checked this out of the library and listened to it all the way through twice. (&quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;, the only interesting song here --still completely meaningless -- I listened to three times.) There are no melodies whatsoever. The lyrics are utterly banal. The song that really irks me, though, is &quot;Freedom&quot;. This one was obviously thrown together as a cynical exploitation piece and tacked on. It's astounding how low some people will stoop.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|In 1983, right when Roger Moore had been welcome as 007 to audiences, the word was out: \\"Sean Connery IS James Bond in: Never Say Never Again\\".  But this film leaves a question: should Connery have said \\"never again\\"?<BR>       This film is basically a remake of 1965's \\"Thunderball\\".  It was based on a story by Jack Whittingham, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming, as was Thunderball, and it tells of two hijacked warheads and how the evil Maximillian Largo (originally Emilio) hides them.  Okay, I might have confused you, but this film will occasionally leave you confused.  It's alright, but doesn't really have the adventurous feeling of the other James Bond films.  <BR>       This was my first DVD, and it was a good one to begin with.  It has the general DVD stuff: feature presentation, interactive menus, and a theatrical trailer, plus scene selections.  That's about all this DVD has to offer.  Oh well!  The picture is good, and the sound is OK/good.  Out of 5: 3.8
B00005KFUM|5.0|Listening to this CD is like witnessing something ground-breaking, earth-shaking happening. The individual songs seem almost alive, eager to be played out and listened to. They bristle with energy. The different instruments and synths weave themselves among each other and create an intricate mesh that is a beauty to behold and listen to. It is hard to believe that someone could add to this atmosphere with their vocals without distracting, but Bellamy has done it. He has an incredible range and manages to strengthen the structure of each song. If I had one word to describe this CD, it would be epic, and even that does not do enough justice.
B000003TAB|5.0|nirvana has done a good job with this album. brilliant. track by track, are great sounds. although it isnt my favorite nirvana cd (i cant choose between them all) doesnt mean it doesnt have some great songs on it. my personal favorites are SLIVER and DIVE. even the POLLY remix is good. nirvana has done well with this one, as they did with all the others. buy this cd and the others. kepp listening to nirvana. its much better than most of the crap that is out nowadays.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I guess I'm in the camp of people who don't think this film really needed to be made, even by H.G. Wells's great-grandson, though I'm not a huge fan of the George Pal-Rod Taylor version either.  The effects are fantastic and the designs are great -- the morlock predators are truly frightening, Jeremy Irons looks fantastically creepy, the time machine itself is beautiful and the digital rendition of landscapes changing over time is breathtaking.  Still, I didn't feel the script had anything important to say and left H.G.'s debate about utopia and free will totally out of it -- which seems to be a disservice to the author -- particularly surprising from a descendant considering how important H.G. considered it.  Having the Eloi speak English 800,000+ years in the future is pretty jarring, but this and other small problems could be forgiven if the film were just more substantive.  There are good dvd edition extras here including: commentary tracks with the director and editor, producer and production designer; behind-the-scenes featurettes about  special effects and fight choreography; trailers; a deleted scene; photo gallery; production notes; and bio-/filmographies. The film can be heard in English, Spanish or French, with English or Spanish subtitles.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I saw this in the movies and loved it, but on DVD it captured my heart. As the music and movie ran tears brimmed my eyes. The acting is wonderful and the music blended perfectly. I don't care what anyone tells you. Always decide for yourself and do not let anyone decide for you. But believe me this is a splendid movie.<br />Also you get a second DVD with all the deleted scenes. A very nice video/music scene you will like plays \\"Now We Are Free.\\" You will enjoy this history of the DVD and I believe there's even some secret tricks in this DVD but I don't know what. An enjoyable DVD that is worth your time and effort.<br />Worth your money.
B000067CPX|5.0|this is an amazing album.  i heard the title track and halfway liked it at first, so i decided to check out the rest of the cd.  i was expecting typical chili peppers funk-punk rapping and over the top basslines, but i came to find that this album is beautifully composed and layered.  it is indefinitely their best album to date, and is well worth your money.  songs to check out are \\"i could die for you\\" \\"minor thing\\" \\"dosed\\" \\"can't stop\\" and \\"the zephyr song\\".  \\"cabron\\" is a catchy latin inspired song, that can grow a bit old.  The only song on this album i would even begin to criticize is \\"throw away your television\\"  it just doesnt have the same element that the rest of the songs do, but even it is a good song.  id go so far as to say this is probably going to be the greatest album of the year. buy it.
0805062971|5.0|Fight Club is one of my all time favorite movies, so I decided it would only be right for me to read the book. I was DEFINETLY not disappointed. The style in which this book is written is absolutly brilliant. It holds your attention and makes you wonder what's going to happen next (even if you have seen the movie). I'll never regret the day I picked up this book. I was blown away by everything about this book. I make everyone I know read this book...and I would recommend it to anyone.
0446605409|5.0|A fabulously entertaining read with a hilarious, likable protanganist and interesting dialougue, I consider Plum Island one of my top ten books.  Not for the plot - while it was nicely woven and gave a fascinating picture of that area of New England- but for the story and the effortless relationships between characters.  DeMille has no need to clearly state any relationships or give absolute definitions - girlfriend, partner, enemy, ect.  They fall into place seemingly without any effort by the author.  While reading, I forget entirely that I am reading a book by an author, and begin to think that I am being told an amusing tale by an ex-cop named John Corey.  The next book in this series is equally entertaining, and offers new relationships with the same authentic ring.  I was mildly disappointed by the speed with which John Corey abandons one love interest and picks up another, but this is a small complaint in a set of hilariously written novels.
B00005K9LK|4.0|The only reason this doesn't get five stars is becuase of \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\". What an awful song! What were they thinking when they made it??<br />Alright, here are some positive comments.<br />As for my favorite song on the album, alright, I am going to shock everyone of you: \\"Take These Chains\\". I don't care; make fun of me all you want. I have no clue why. Don't worry- I also love the real metal songs like \\"Bloodstone\\", \\"Riding On The Wind\\" and the classic title track.<br />I think that after \\"British Steel\\", Priest's sound became more commercial with each album until \\"Ram It Down\\". Well, \\"Painkiller\\" is just awesome and I think most of you know that. But, my point is my favorite JP album is \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" and after that, each album keeps getting progressivley worse until \\"Ram It Down\\". I'm not saying \\"Ram It Down\\" is one of the best albums ever but it's better and less commercail than \\"Turbo\\" so the chain ends there.<br />Meanwhile, there is SO much more to this album than \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" so crank up the rest of the album and enjoy, folk's.
0316666343|5.0|As I read through some of the reviews here today, I wondered if I read the same book as some others had. To each his own, but I found this book breathtakingly beautiful. Since so many stories of young girls being abducted have been in the news of late, the book is also very timely.<br /><br />The book begins with the death of Susie Salmon (like the fish, as she would say). So begins the story of a family torn apart by her disappearnce, and the ultimate acceptance of her death. Through Susie's eyes we learn of what her experience in heaven is like, and her close bonds with those she has left behind on earth. We watch the mystery of her death unfold, the changes in her friends and family and see it all through Suzie's forever 14 eyes. I stayed up all night unable to stop turning the pages.<br /><br />A unique and ultimately uplifting story, I recommend this book very highly.
B00005K9LN|4.0|This is a very good Priest album but I like &quot;Hell Bent For Leather&quot; better. Then it's this, &quot;Point Of Entry&quot;, &quot;Screaming&quot; and &quot;Painkiller&quot;.<br />Alright, about the album. Anybody who claims to listen to good rock stations HAS to know &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; and/or &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;. The overall sound of the album is relatively simple; I can play &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; on guitar. At times, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; almost sounds like a more commercial Motorhead (!) because it's so fast.<br />Overall, recommended for beginners. If you liked &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, the album's sound is very similar so don't be afraid to dig deeper into the realm of heavy things, my friends...
B00005JL3A|2.0|If you're looking for a great horror movie with an eerie back drop, flesh eating zombies and plenty of blood you're definitely looking in the wrong place! The eerie mansion backdrop of the video game is completely absent instead replaced by an over stylized laboratory and the basic premise of the game (survival horror) is thrown out of the window.<br />Instead you get a bunch of incompetent special forces jerks who have no personality and seem to not think of trying a headshot when the people they shoot get back up after emptying entire magazines into them. This movie plays more like a crappy matrix remake with zombies delivering neck-breaking and kung-fu kicks galore instead of horror. Another thing there's no blood when they shoot 'em in the head just a shot of the gun going off and a quick cut to the tiny bullet hole on the forehead of the zombie; no forehead squibbs!<br />The best thing about this movie is Milla Jovovich gets naked. You can even tell that some of the background in the mess hall tank sequence are 2-D paintings. As for any campy fun, none to speak of; very low gore it's mostly sterile CG stuff, the zombies just seem to nibble not taking a single bloody chunk out of anybody and in my opinion if you can't see it free of charge, don't.
B000067CPX|5.0|Your first listen of \\"By the Way\\" catches you by surprise if you are a fan of the peppers.  It is very melodic, using incredible harmonies and lacking the hyper-fast bass lines and rapping by Flea and Anthony Kiedis.  What it has is probably their best collection of songs they have produced.  The Chili Peppers have grown up and like other bands who have been around for 20 years, the ideas that inspired them to create the music 20 years ago have changed and are not the same and that is why their music is different.  There are only a few bands (e.g. ACDC) whho's music is practically identical to their first album.  THe difference with the Peppers is that it works beautifully.  The title track, Zephyr Song, Can't Stop, Midnight, Tear, and Minor Thing are incredible songs with only By The Way sounding like their previous work.  Their use of harmony is new and it works magically on Tear and On Midnight.  With most Peppers albums, there about 4-5 songs which sound out of place or just bad.  Here, only \\"I Could Die for you\\"\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" are the only bad songs and with 16 tracks, not bad at all.  This album is the sound of a band maturing and coming into their own and in my opinion, they have never sounded better.
0345446798|5.0|I've never written this about a Non-Fiction Book, but &quot;The Other End of the Leash&quot; is so good you can't put it down and don't want it to end!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I've seen a range of reactions to this album.  Most reviewers acknowledge that the music is fantastic and inspired, but some feel the need to say something like this: &quot;it's not the Soft Bulletin, so I'm disappointed&quot;.  It's unfair to use that as criteria to dislike an album, I'd say.  Sure, the Soft Bulletin is more affecting, the peaks of musical brilliance are loftier, and the album's conceptual flow is near-perfect.  However, that has nothing to do with THIS album.  I friggin love this album, partly BECAUSE it's not another Soft Bulletin.  If the Lips had tried to make a S.B. sequel, it would have surely been a tired and disappointing attempt.  Albums like that only come around every so often, and the Lips did the right thing by moving on.<br />That said, Yoshimi is some of their very best work.  I've been listening to it daily, sometimes several times a day, since the day it came out, and I'm still itching to hear it.  There are some absolutely gorgeous songs on here.  Fight Test is one of the best, most interesting, catchy and endearing opening tracks I've heard in a long time, and One More Robot is beautiful, with a lulling bass line and some of Wayne's most beautifully fractured and disconnected vocals ever.  Every effect in this song is done to perfection and it creates a real mood.  The Yoshimi Suite is actually my least favorite part of the album.  Part I is a fine song, but a bit predictable, and Part II, though an interesting idea, is just grating.  However, the album takes off from there.  In The Morning (#5) is one of the Lips' finest songs ever.  Again, a great bass line holds the song together while the layered orchestral sounds make the transition phases just beautiful.  More great, emotional singing by Mr. Coyne here, too.  Ego Tripping... follows, and it has yet another amazingly catchy and unifying bass line, and subtle but great flourishes of guitars flesh out the song nicely.  Are You a Hypnotist is both spooky and pretty, It's Summertime is a great dreamy song in the Lips tradition, Do you Realize is a fine song that could get some airplay if it's marketed at all, and the final two songs are also strong.<br />I'd say my favorite thing about this album is that it simultaneously carries currents of sincere emotion and comical fun.  Some of the music on Yoshimi could be the soundtrack to a cartoon, but even so, it's some of the most heartfelt stuff they've done so far.  Best of 2002 so far, by a wide margin.
B00005YW4H|3.0|This is a good album, but it definitely has its flaws.  Norah definitely has an amazing voice and she really conveys a sense of sweetness and seductiveness effectively.  That said, the album is a bit light on some elements.  First, the arrangements tend to be sleepy and similar to one another.  She has a good mix of jazz and other styles, but there is never much energy to the tunes, and despite talented musicians, the instrumentals seem lacadaisical.  Also, her lyrics are irritating to me in a few places, where the writer is obviously trying too hard to force a rhyme.  For example, one verse in the title track has the lines &quot;Come away with me on a bus...where they can't tempt us.&quot;  In an otherwise sweet and genuine sounding song, these lines seem reminiscent of Dr. Seuss.  So while I would rate the album as solid overall, there are definitely some issues that keep it from being great.
B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth is easily one of my favorite bands of all time and this record is a perfect example of their sound.  This album has a little bit of everything:  Fast, thrash songs full of heavy riffs, awesome acoustic songs, and songs that start out slow but end up getting fast.  <br />What is so great about this cd is that it flows so well from track to track.  It's like the band just sat down and recorded the songs in order, back to back with no problems or rest at all.   John is one of the greatest rhythm guitar players and this cd shows off his, thick, quick, percise riffs.  Barlow can go to a thrashing growl to a melodic singing voice like no body's business.  The songs are just the right length, not too short or too long.  <br />The last three tracks is the something wicked trilogy and listening to them in order is great.  The bass and drums pound away and add to the urgency and speed of the faster songs.  Track 9(1776) is an instrumental track and I was quite suprised by it because most instrumentals below seven minutes are not very good but this one is really really great.  The lyrics are another highlight.  Although not a concept album, each song on here is sort of a like a story.  <br />The chorus' on the cd are amazing and make the songs really shine through.  My favorite songs on this album would be: Disicples Of The Lie, My Own Savior, Birth Of The Wicked, Consequences &amp; Watching Over Me(the only two songs that are ballads on this cd).<br />But you will want to listen to the whole album because it's so fast paced and well organized that it goes by like a flash and you'll want to hear it again.<br />Excellent cd, I give it my highest recommendation.  I highy suggest buying this album.
0790729652|4.0|&quot;Batman&quot; is a great movie. It is true to the comic book and it is definately a classic. But it does have its flaws just like any other movie. I am a fan of Batman and what would please me and maybe some others would be if it were darker and more gothic. Batman is a superhero but I mean we DO call him the &quot;Dark Knight&quot;. What's the point of calling him the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; if he isn't dark. Maybe if you put in some churches or some foggy nights, that would &quot;pour some dressing on the salad&quot;. They also should've made it longer and with it being longer, you can make the movie into an origin story, basically starting the film when he is a child and show his development into becoming Batman in a length of ten to fifteen minutes, then go on to showing his battle with the Joker.<br />But overall, &quot;Batman&quot; is a great movie with style and atmosphere. Definately a must-see!
B000067G3C|5.0|Speed is a classic film starring Keanu Reeves,Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole time. I bought this movie on DVD a few years ago and then when I heard they were coming out with a Five star edition I was so happy.  Finally we get to see interviews that was not in the original DVD release.  The original only had a theatrical release and a widescreen presentation. A must have for any  Dvd collection.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If only &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; had dusted off it's poppy sleeves and unsheltered it's dazzling razzles 10 years ago. I would of been innocent back then, age 9, still unkempt and drawing on illogics and faulty imagination to explain why the sun goes up, and then down, or why the sky is blue. Surely now, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; dangles it all in front of me, a neo-masterpiece so overtaken with its self, it pays homage to homages of 1940's music movies. And why shouldn't it? As inventive as cinema can be, as colorful as a bright enigmatic rainbow vehicle, as atrociously addictive and likeable, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; transcends travesty and tragedy itself, breaking barriers from the inside out. Sure, the sets are lavish, the music appreciative, the culture creative, but the feeling of it is like a heart rising out of your body and winking at you. Baz Lurhmann doesn't sing; he yelps glittering gallons of melodramatic hipster hop, redefining cool as yesterday, and savoring every surface of it. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman spare no less, with intoxicating animosity in their quiet loud emotions. Critics spar between glorious filmmaking and watered-down flashiness, but I'll take the former. This ain't no Betty Boop bonanza that turns on 60 old geezers who are spitting out their dentures. This is musical surreality that turns on everyone with truth, beauty, freedom, and love lunging out of it, grasping, and never letting go.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie is a great epic war picture.  One of my favorite movies.  First mel gibson movie I have seen. I have seen this movie ten times and I still love and never get sick of it and it's an awsome movie. the Dvd is great it has so many features.<BR>The movie just rocks.  the part i didn't like is when he died at the end of the movie.  Best scene is the first war because he seems very tough in that scene.  Mel gibson directs this great picture. Best feature in this dvd is mel gibson interview.  See it
B0000640VO|5.0|That's what I think of this movie.  The imagery, tale, and whimsy all put together on one tiny disc so beautifully, that once you see this you will feel the same.<br />The first thing you will notice is the stunning camera work, then the actors, then the plot.  The direction of this is so brilliant.  The tale itself is pure whimsy but it will leave you with a sense of well-being.<br />All of the cast did an exceptional job and you will find that reading the subtitles is, in most cases, not neccessary.  The director, actors and cinematographer have the uncanny ability to tell the entire story, along with mood that even if you don't read the subtitles, or for that matter understand French you will know what is going on.  The actors delivery of thier lines let you in on every detail that is happening or about to happen.<br />The extras on this DVD is worth a look as well. Most of the time the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stuff that laden DVD's  is worthless, such is not the case.  Take the time to look at all of the interviews and in particular, the director and the cinematographer.  When you get a glimpse as to what it took to make this, you will be astounded.  Sure it's not full of car chases, explosions or any other very high-tech special effects, but rather the director's vision and use of color to set the tone of every single scene.  It is amazing.  When you hear those blowhard directors talk about pouring thier souls into films generally, you pay no mind.  However, with Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it's a whole different issue.  The attention he paid to even the smallest detail is impressive, to say the least.<br />I find this film to be more palatable than his &quot;City of Lost Children&quot; which is a bit more like &quot;Brazil&quot;. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, can get a tad complicated at times, but in Amelie, he does not lose focus for one second and you finish the film with the thought that there is a little bit of Amelie in all of us, but perhaps there should be more.<br />It doesn't matter if you are male or female, if you like action or sci-fi, this is not  a &quot;chick flick&quot;, this is a film for all. One of the best films made last year that should have had more recognition than it did.<br />Pick it up, you won't be sorry!

B000021YQV|4.0|I remember listening to Sugar of their first album about 3 or 4 years ago in my friends car, and while that song was so very very hard, it was definitely melodic in the strangest way, I was hooked on SOAD.  I let them slip of my music radar, until this album kind of exploded onto it.  They're as hard as they ever were, but their melodies have moved to the forefront, and they're so much better for it.  I love this album, its musically complex and just a little off.  That little offness is what makes them so popular, they are unimitable.  The combination of the theatric vocals of Serj and the rabid instrumentation of Odadjian and Malakian is kind of without peer in the metal community, oh I forgot the drumming of Dolmayan, quite excellent to say the least.  The highlights are Aerials, Toxicity, and the fine Prison Song, even if it is a little too political for me, I still love it.  And of course the people who knew of them before Toxicity are going to cry foul and say they sold out to radio.  But no one else sounds like them, so they are completely wrong.  I'm a little late on this one, oh well.
B000066NW0|5.0|I started out hating Avril Lavigne (i'm not a pop person), but my friend drove me crazy singing &quot;Complicated&quot; and I bought the CD. It's very nice; her voice sounds a tiny bit like Alanis! I love the special features, the songs are cool, and her voice is good! She's a WONDERFUL change from Britney (yuck), who's trying WAY too hard nowadays. I like the majority of the songs on this, but one thing- it's not punk! Why does everyone say it is? :)
079073804X|5.0|I'll admit, I'm a fan of \\"slice 'em and dice 'em\\" flicks, but even I thought this movie made the hairs on the back of my head stand on end!!  I was 10 years old when I first saw this film (my parents would fall asleep with the T.V. on and I would sit and watch it). It scared the pants off me, and it still does 18 years later, no matter how many times I see it!!!<br />The film centers around a rather typical young girl, Reagan, her talented actress/mother, Chris, and several other characters.  When strange things start to happen, young Reagan seems to be the center of it all.  As a last resort, her mother calls apon a middle aged priest, Father Damien Karris, who discovers that the youth is possessed by a force who calls himself The Devil!<br />This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  Some people that I have talked to weren't to impressed with the slow begining, but I found that it added so much to the film.  The deleted scenes made it even more frightening than when I saw it the first time.  The acting was excellent, the story line is an A++, and the special effects were haunting (who knew that a whole room had to be refridgerated an entire night so that they could achieve those special effects!!!  So much for computer generated, wouldn't you say!!)<br />If you are a fan of classic horror (and even if you're not), I strongly suggest you get the 25th Special Edition DVD!  It'll give you a chill like no other!!
B000002J27|5.0|&quot;A Trick Of The Tail&quot; benefits from the fact that the group had to prove themselves equal to ex-bandmate Peter Gabriel after his <BR>1975 departure.  Gabriel's presence had provided the group's<BR>lyrical edge, soulful vocals and delicate flute playing, as well as their reputation for theatrical rock through his stunning use of masks and costumes on stage.  In order to make up for this gap, the four remaining members put their all into &quot;Trick&quot;, which upon release became the band's biggest selling item to date.  On first listen, the album seems overwhelmingly magical; Collins sounds uncannily similar to Gabriel (this would lessen with each successive release), and his harmonies on &quot;Entangled&quot; are superior to anything done previously.  The album opens with the one-two punch of &quot;Dance On A Volcano&quot;, which opens up vast, deep vistas of sound onto which the band display some of the most focused and virtuosic playing in their career, then settles down into Hackett's brilliantly mesmerizing &quot;Entangled&quot;, a gentle acoustic number that builds in intensity through its deceptive lyric and Banks' regal keyboard work.  &quot;Squonk&quot;, which follows, foreshadows a bit what was to come on future albums, although it is still a keeper.  &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot;, which closes side one, takes one on a breathtaking journey through windswept desert sandscapes and cosmic synth/piano stylings which remains one of Tony Banks' finest moments on record.  <br />Side two is a bit iffier, as the opening &quot;Robbery, Assault And Battery&quot;, while energic, features a duff music-hall styled lyric that is only rescued during the instrumental break.  &quot;Ripples&quot; is a classic, featuring more of the ambrosiac sounds of Banks' synths and Hackett's backwards guitar against the delicate 12-string guitar work; its lacey perfection summarizes the achievements of the album.  The poppy title track follows, which although telling a charmingly sad tale, does not musically hold up to repeated listenings.  The closing &quot;Los Endos&quot;, however, is a sweeping fusion-inspired instrumental which reprises several of the other tracks on the album and rounds things out in divine fashion.  This album is extremely accessible--even commercial--<BR>prog-rock, although it does not lose its sense of authenticity.<BR>It is just solidly made, tasteful fare, although it misses Gabriel's inspiration in a few places and this tendency would increase with each successive effort.  Still, one of their best.
B00006690G|5.0|This album is one of the best albums i have ever heard. Nothing can compare to it. My favorite song, believe it or not, is \\"Drips\\". The chorus is very catchy. WARNING: \\"Drips\\" is a song delivering a detailed description of sex and STDs that that should NOT be exposed to children (if i may borrow a line from \\"PSA\\" in the Slim Shady LP) with laces in their shoes. That song was also cut from the edited version of \\"The Eminem Show\\". Ok. Another gem on this album is \\"Sing for the Moment\\" The message is so deep, including an excerpt from the infamous song \\"Dream on\\" by Aerosmith that talks about how kids will be kids. In short, tracks 2,3,4,5,7,9,10,12,14 and 16 really stand out as hits that you may hear on the radio. In general, it seems to me that Em is just explaining himself, and he does a good job of doing it.
B000002J1M|5.0|Genesis have frequently said that they never made their equivalent of a \\"Tommy\\" or \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" although all of their albums between 1972-76 could fit that bill.  \\"Foxtrot\\" was the first, being the first to chart in the UK (at #12), and providing them with two pieces, \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\", which would support them for years to come.  Today the album is a prog-rock icon of sorts, although the general sound and production would not take a leap forward until the following \\"Selling England By The Pound\\".  What we do have here is solid songwriting and emotional playing, with not a weak track in sight (well, maybe \\"Time Table\\").  \\"Supper's Ready\\" is the group's only side-long piece but it is perhaps the definitive side-long prog track, moving as it does from wistful acoustic strumming to pure pop, heavy metal, burlesque music-hall parody and ELP keyboard pomp before closing in majestic style.  The story, one of the struggle of two lovers against evil, is a parable for the apocalypse in the bible, although<BR>there are many occult and Eastern religious references scattered throughout. In all, the album's postmodern philosophical wisdom (also displayed in the tongue-in-cheek sci-fi tale \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday), matched with Collins' sophisticated drumming style, Banks omnipresent keyboards and Hackett's genuinely varied array of sound effects on guitar, create a sound that is not to be repeated in years since.  Foxtrot is the sound of a band jetting ahead toward their next album, as the lyrics at the end of Supper's Ready write \\"Continued\\".
B00006FDCD|4.0|The problem with Stephen King is that his books rarely get translated to film very well. Certainly not at the level as something more simplistic, like Harry Potter. But for the adaptations done so far, this is definately one of the better ones, with The Stand also showing that miniseries are the way to translate King's vision to celluloid.<br />IT has a masterful performance by Tim Curry as Pennywise. Although many aspects of the book have still been left out, and some things changed, the story manages to contain much of the essence of the printed page. Certainly better and less cheesy than some of the more horrid \\"Based on a story by Stephen King\\" material, like Maximum Overdrive or the unfortunately rather B-movie-esque Christine.<br />I only hope than when and if The Talisman gets done, it does a better job than all the rest.
B00005OAIE|5.0|this cd is one of my absolute favorites. i heard no such thing on the radio and was instantly hooked. the lyrics just kinda jumped out and hit me. its such a fun song that i had to hear the rest of the cd. i borrowed it from my friend and fell in love with his totally creative lyrics and mellow voice. this cd is far from mellow though. it has a great purposeful feeling without feeling forced or too harsh. its a great cd to just sit back and relax to, you'll find yourself humming it in your car on the way to work, unable to get these great tracks out of your head. definitely on my list of the best cds this year
B00004WLXZ|3.0|The commentary by Anthony R. Santoro is terrible.  He has no particular opinions on the film's direction or aesthetics, and his 'thoughts' consist mainly of self-evident play-by-play observations.  His knowledge of German is obviously cursory at best, his jokes are lame and irrelevant, and his pronunciation of \\"Nazi\\" rhymes, annoyingly, with \\"Nancy.\\"  My advice is: wait for a truly definitive edition with valuable materials before you actually buy this DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|i heard complicated on the radio about a million times and really liked it and finally ended up getting the cd after my friends all told me the rest of the album was even better than the radio single. i was absolutely in love the moment i pressed play. its goes from upbeat to in your face to contemplative and everywhere inbetween and manages to do so without seeming broken or jumpy. its a great blending of a talented voice, honest lyrics and catchy melodies. don't be scared away by its punk classification. i'm by no means a punk fan but this cd is a must have!
6305313687|5.0|American History X is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen.  Edward Norton definitely deserved his Oscar for this role.  His great acting mixed with the stunning direction and cinematography makes this a truly brilliant film.  The story is the best part, it's about having the ability to put aside differences is what makes a true American and that having anger never makes your life better.  I recommend it to anyone who believes themself an American.
068981528X|2.0|The book begins as a clever retelling of the classic Three Little Pigs.  The pigs and the wolves have changed parts, and the building materials have been upgraded, but the classic story remains...the big bad pig is coming to destroy the home that the wolves have worked so hard to build.  But in this story, the big bad pig is prepared to blow the house down no matter how well it is built and the attacks escallate.  Explosives are launched, once again their home is completely obliterated, and the wolves \\"just managed to escape with their fluffy tails scorched\\".  At this point, the wolves have resigned themselves to the fact that the pig will never leave them alone and it's no use to build again.  They go off to live in the open and plant a few sweet smelling flowers.<br />It isn't long before the big bad pig reappears, but this time he's subdued both by the pretty flowers and by the fact there's no longer a home asking to be obliterated, and the weary wolves invite the pig to live with them happily ever after.  What's the moral of the story?  If you find yourself being terrorized and victimized, the fiend that's after you really wants to be friends with you if only you'll share?  Call me a stick-in-the-mud, but I think this would be a very unhealthy message for children who haven't been blessed with story-book perfect lives of their own and who may have a big bad pig or two in their own lives to contend with.
B000002VC5|5.0|I Robot is the standard by which all progressive rock should be measured. This is perhaps the best album the APP ever did. It was their second album, but the first to be issued by their longtime label Arista and the first to breakthrough to a wider audience. Parsons, Woolfson, and the band put on a great performance and for all the sonic brilliance and technical wizardry - which holds up just as well today as it did in 1977 - you get a sense of the Project letting loose in a way they would never quite match again. The title track, \\"I Wouldn't Want to be Like You,\\" \\"Breakdown,\\" and \\"The Voice\\" are all uptempo tracks, with the pensive \\"Some Other Time,\\" the encouraging ballad \\"Don't Let It Show,\\" and the Pink Floyd-ish \\"The Show Must Go On\\" interspersed in between. Musically, the album could be a little bit more enterprising - the never changing drum and bass lines of the title track seem to set the pace for the entire album. In fact, the backing band seems to play with a pedantic, almost robotic precision. But, given the album's concept, that would stand to reason. But the keyboard washes of \\"Nucleus,\\" the exotic cimbalom of \\"I Robot,\\" and the jazz chords of \\"I Wouldn't Want to be Like You\\" give the album a much-needed touch of entrepreneurship. The album ends on a low note with the schizophrenic orchestration of &quot;Total Eclipse,&quot; and the depressing instrumental &quot;Genesis Ch. 1 V. 32,&quot; but at least it fits in well with the album's concept and does not jade the album as a whole. All in all, if you get any album by the Alan Parsons Project, let it be I Robot. Start here, just as music lovers in 1977 did.
B000066I6N|5.0|Plant brings originality and a clear voice to his interpretations of old songs. I've not heard better from him in years.  It's no rehash of Led Zeppelin tunes.  I couldn't find one I didn't like - and that's pretty rare.
B00004RYZT|5.0|Live Aus Berlin (LAB for short) is by far the best live show I have ever seen.  Rammstein fans will not be disappointed.  If you have seen the beginning of the film XXX, then you have witnessed a sampling of a Rammstein performance.  Rammstein performs with pyrotechnics like a Kiss concert times ten, costuming on par with Gwar, and lights and set right out of musical theater.  Yet, for all this, Rammstein is distinctly German. The songs are taken from Sehnsucht and Herzeleid, but the highlight of the show is a stunning performance of the single, Wilder Wein.  During this beuatiful ballad, all three guitarist step onstage dressed in oversized sombreros as each strums the haunting melody as a kind of mariachi band.  It is unlike anything I have ever seen, both humorous and eerie.  The only downside is that the vesion I own had the song Buch Dich (Bend Over) cut from the show.  However, an extensive interview with scenes from Ramstein's videos and other live performances made up for this minor setback.  All in all, I highly reccommend this DVD for any fan of Industrial/Heavy Metal music.  Rammstein shows their appreciation for their fans by putting on one helluva show.
6300214370|3.0|Hollywood's love affair for dance and music movies has continued unabated ever since Fred and Ginger waltzed their way across the screen in the 1930s. In FOOTLOOSE, director Herbert Ross has successfully melded several movies in one: teen filled angst against society, dancing as a way of life, and the fitting in of a loner. Kevin Bacon is immensely appealing with his boyish good looks and bouncing feet as Ren, a teen who has moved with his family from the big city to the small town. In the past, Hollywood has usually portrayed the small town citizens as closed-minded hicks who somehow fear that the city slicker in their midst will expose their hollowness for all to see. But in this case, the only static that Ren receives is from the jealous boyfriend of a girl who likes Ren's big city ways. Christopher Penn starts out as one of those hicks who seems to dislike Ren, but soon finds that he has more in common with him than with his other oafish friends. Penn is particulary appealing as the left-footed fish out of water who needs to learn how to dance and sees that Ren can teach him that old one and a two. But it is the charismatic Kevin Bacon who carries this picture on his smile and feet. When Ren learns that dancing has been outlawed in his new small town home, he immediately begins a crusade to reinstall the legitimacy of rock and roll music. FOOTLOOSE has many scenes that showcase the talent of the cast's dancing. Bacon has most of the best scenes but Penn steals the show with his improved bumping, then strutting steps. Lori Singer is appealing as Bacon's female lead. John Lithgow as Singer's Bible thumping, rock and roll hating preacher father, exemplifies the hate-Elvis sector that ruled much of America's small town mentality in the fifties. The clash between the generations is highlighted not so much by the movie's use of dancing as an expression of rage against their elders, but by the concluding speech that Bacon gives that sounds as if Jimmy Stewart could nothave done a better job in using the Bible as evidence that God does not disapprove of pop dancing. FOOTLOOSE is really an excuse for the cast to use dancing as a metaphor both for having fun and for expressing the same but far more muted rage that Marlon Brando snarled at his elders in THE WILD ONE.
B000002AP1|5.0|Ouch. This CD hurts. Iggy's remix certainly does justice to the title, this mix is redlined and screaming all the way. To my ears, this is a vast improvement over the original, which I never could bond with. In fact, I thought it was so bad that it took a lot of convincing to buy this newly mixed version, but I'm glad I did. This album is a thermo-nuclear tantrum.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|I rented this last night without reading the back cover or reviews, being under the impression that it was a serious re-make of a classic movie.... ... <br />I hated the constant, frantic flashing around of scenes... my eyes could hardly focus on a scene before the camera bounced off to another shot, usually totally different. And the frantic, loud, mostly flat music assaulted my ears as badly as the camera did my eyes. After 49 minutes (yes, I counted nearly every one of them) of hoping the movie would get better or at very least settle down, I finally turned it off with a huge sigh of disgust and said, \\"Welllll, it only cost a dollar.\\" Wasn't even worth that.<br />Just so you all know... I'm not a staid, fuddywuddy, as I generally like artsy-fartsy and art nouveau movies, but this wasn't artsy, or even arty... only frantic and noisy. I was in total disbelief that it was even considered for the Oscars, let alone nominated.<br />I give this nose-wrinkling, eye-narrowing, frown-making, sour lemon of a movie a strong, hearty two thumbs DOWN!!... <br />Of course... this is only MY opinion, haha.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK is reinventing metal to its 80's roots.  This CD rocks so hard, I saw myself dancing around the room listening to She is Beautiful and Ready to Die, just to name a few.  There is so much energy and fun on the album that I find it can brighten you up if your feeling down.  It is very uplifting music.  Certainly the sound is very '80ish' but is today's scene of rehashes of the same nu-metal garbage, Andrew WK is certainly a breath of fresh air.
B0000025T6|2.0|At a risk of seeming sacrilegious...<br /><br />Hold these as self evident truths of Real Rock 'N' Roll:<br /><br />* There is nothing wrong with down-beat music which addresses the lot of the desperate and down trodden. In fact, it's pretty cool.<br />* There is nothing wrong with simple musical construction. Mostly, the more simple its construction is, the more appealing popular music is. Case in point: Bob Dylan always beats Yes.<br />* There is nothing wrong with murder balladry. It has a great tradition in popular and folk music, from Leadbelly to Nick Cave.<br />* There is nothing wrong with home recorded records. In the rock canon, they're usually pretty special - pared back, honest, brutal, completely lacking in studio trickery.<br /><br />Do the maths, therefore, and you will conclude that, in Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska, you have a genuine rock classic.<br /><br />And so, scores of Amazon reviewers before me will tell you, you do. Recorded in his bedroom with a four track tape player, there are no drums, no blaring electric guitars - in fact it's the boss, his blues harp, his wooden top guitar, and some sort of echo effect, singing Gritty Lyrics about a small time punk in Nebraska who kills in a fit of desperation and ends up in The Chair.<br /><br />Springsteen sets up a mood which drips desolation, no question about it. But I don't buy it. As usual, his lyrics are mumbled, so unless you listen very hard, it's pretty difficult to tell what's going on. And he mumbles them in a monotone, a lot of the time. A dull, nasal monotone. Now, it's all very well having a simple musical construction, but there does need to be some construction: for lengthy periods on Nebraska, the melody is so scant it disappears. Songs - even the last song - don't end as much as just tail off, as if Springsteen can't be bothered thinking of a way to kill them.<br /><br />And, though I risk a deluge of abuse in saying so, there is this sense I just can't rid of that it is all a little contrived. The self-image that Bruce Springsteen has carefully painted is squarely the working class, working man, but can you imaging such a man having any truck with this sort of liberal, hand-wringing dirge? And isn't all this bitter rumination about the brutality of life at the violent end of Reaganomics just a little too literate - a little too sophisticated - for Springsteen's natural constituency? Doesn't he speak for the same people who missed the irony in Born In The USA, and voted Republican anyway?<br /><br />Nebraska checks all the right boxes, but cynically. In terms of a lyrical statement (let alone a musical one) it fails to impress: despite its subject matter and mood, there's nothing especially indelible about this record.<br /><br />Thoroughly over-rated.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonrefully painted is squarely the working class, working man, but can you imaging such a man having any truck with this sort of liberal, hand-wringing dirge?

6305307261|5.0|This production is my ABSOLUTE favorite film rendition of the Dracula story.. Who can portray Dracula better than Klaus Kinski?<br />In certain scenes you can see Werner Herzog obviously mirroring Murnau's direction from the silent film \\"Nosferatu\\" Like Lucy's vigil at the seashore, waiting for Jonathan's return, remind me so much of the Murnau film. <br />And although it contains aspects of the Murnau film, this IS NOT a DIRECT remake. If you have ever seen the silent film with Max Schreck in the title role, you'll see this is different. With a different ending...<br />Klaus Kinski is MESMERIZING and absolutely delectible! With shaven head, ghostly pale skin, long white fingers & defined even more against his long black suit. And his usual great self-direction. In most scenes he moves almost insect like.<BR>He so keenly delivers such a fantastic performance, that's forever etched in my mind. Creating a disturbing and creepy aura, yet also very poignant and moving...<BR>\\"As for me, the absence of love, is the most abject pain\\"..he mournfully says.<br />Lucy and the Count's interaction together, their expressions to each other, it's so profound (oddly & intensely romantic). It really affects me.<br />Bruno Ganz is also great as Jonathan, the hapless real estate agent, sent to Dracula's lonely castle in the desolate outreaches. His stay with the Count, the way they react to each other. Are sometimes humorous. The way he watches Jonathan eat... He asks him \\"Listen, The children of the night make their music.\\" Jonathan gives a mystified look.. The Count looks at him sadly \\"Ah, young man... You're like the villagers, who cannot place themselves in the soul of the hunter.\\"<br />The Count expresses his loneliness throughout..\\"Can you imagine enduring centuries, experiencing the same futility each day?\\"...<br />Some may find it slow in parts, particularly Johnathan and The Counts race to Wismar.<BR>Jonathan's journey is hampered by his urgent escape from the Count's castle,in which he falls from the window. He is taken in by an old couple. And by the time he gets home, he doesn't even recognize Lucy. And he's absolutely forgotten the reason he came home. The doctor attributes it to \\"brain fever\\".<br />He's been bitten, and Lucy sorrowfully watches him slowly deteriorate.<br />Isabelle Adjani is wonderful as Lucy, she seems genuinely affected and her tear-stained eyes are real. She has the power to move you. Lucy knows that it's completely up to her, to save Jonathan And also free Wismar from the mysterious \\"plague\\" that has gripped the city.<br />Also worthy of note is Roland Topor who plays Renfield. Jonathan's employer who is in league with the Count, he calls him \\"master\\". And when Jonathan leaves, Renfield is comitted to a jail cell. He gets more and more excited as he senses the Count's getting closer. He's obnoxious, but thankfully NOT in a way that grates on the nerves or annoys. :-)<br />It's exceptional..a masterpiece= 5+ stars :-)<br />It's visually beautiful and wonderfully well acted. With an exquisite artistic style that permeates throughout.<br />I prefer the German language version as a opposed to the \\"dubbed\\" one, which really isn't dubbed. You can tell the actors are actually speaking English, by reading their lips and the scenes are just slightly different, in the dubbed one.<BR> It may be too \\"artsy\\" for SOME. <BR>But I think it's a treasure.
0399226907|5.0|In my opinion this is on the short list of must have books for kids!<br />The text is lovely. The pictures are adorable. The story line is funny and still based on fact. An egg hatches and out comes a hungry caterpillar who eats her way through everything. One day when she has had enough to eat, she makes a cacoon and comes out a lovely butterfly.<br />The bright pictures that fit in with the words and the predictability make this a good book for pre readers. The rythm to the words make this a fun book to read.<br />Enjoy.
156895963X|5.0|I read Angela's Ashes while on vacation in Italy.  I probably would have finished it in 2 days had it not been for all the sites we wanted to see.  I did carry the book everywhere with me so I could read it during any lulls.  This book is wonderful - you find yourself not only empathizing with the characters, but feeling like you are one of the charaters.  You'll laugh when Frank laughs and cry when he cries.  This is a MUST READ for everyone!
B000069I1H|5.0|In the beginning It's hard to see how anybody wouldn't like this fun little film. It asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors .<BR>this is a movie. A good, old-fashioned, suspend-all-disbelief, Hollywood comedy that leaves you laughing The cast and crew of &quot;Showtime&quot; do a credible job of melding the buddy-cop <BR>film genre with our society's penchant, lately, for the whole reality television business.<BR>I had serious doubts about&quot;Showtime&quot;  expected a combination of<BR>&quot;48 Hours,&quot; Beverly Hills cop~ and the plethora of buddy-cop movies, and not much more But, though there is a lot of all of these flicks in &quot;Showtime,&quot; I have to admit I had a good time watching these veterans play off of each other
B000002G7E|5.0|Well, no, I wouldn't go so far as to call this pop -- it is definitely rock -- but I think my review title gives a good idea just how much good music lies underneath the noise and apparent simplicity of White Light/White Heat.<br />This album is unique in my record collection. It was the ugly duckling. Now it's one of my favorites. This album defied me. I gave it all the chance an album deserved, but it failed. I could see value in Sister Ray and the title track, but the others were boring, hook-less, overlong, often energy-less b-sides to what in comparison seemed like the 'real' Velvet Underground cannon, the actual songs that comprised their other albums. The verdict was in, and my verdicts do not get reversed.<br />But my determined dislike was not enough to stop this album, nor was my almost total abstinence from playing it for ten months. With every listen I gave it, and I think even when I was not listening, it sunk in. At the beginning of The Gift, when the chunky bass riff and drums kick in with the beginning of Cale's narrative, Reed's guitar emits a patient electric buzz, a noise that stuck in the back of my mind for all those months. When I finally became aware of it, that tiny revelation made The Gift an entirely new song. So it was with a thousand other details.<br />The subtle varieties of Sterling's improvised chopping throughout The Gift, the way Cale's viola's whine is so perfectly opposed to the lead guitar in Lady Godiva (did you know there's a viola in that song?). The chugging guitar in the refrain of If She Ever Comes, and the way it sticks around to reinforce the main melody during the second verse. The details of the shifting dynamics of Heard Her Call My Name's ending solo. And Sister Ray: it will be years before I stop noticing new things hidden within the Velvet's fiery performance, just as it was a year before the song could hold my interest beyond the first four minutes.<br />But that is the point: this album is newer every time I hearit. Without resorting to overdubbing and production tricks, the Velvet's created the most essentially complex album I know. The mix is so off that while you're distracted by the noise of three of the band members, the other one sneaks off and plays a brilliant guitar solo. The improvisation is inspired at every moment, but at no moment is it pushed to the front of the mix, or given meaning with a logical song structure that keeps it locked within jam sessions. This, of course, works against the album's favor as far as winning fans goes: I don't care how good you are at listening to music, you are going have to subconsciously memorize this album in it's entirety before the brilliant details stick out, and that's a large investment with no initial pay-off. But I am ok with that. Let other's only see the ugly duckling.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I rented this out of obligation...with all the Oscar nominations and critical acclaim, it was a must-see despite that its premise and cast weren't instantly grabbing.  this is quite a remarkable film.  it is never once boring and it features some of the best ensemble acting i've ever seen.  i'll admit, this is the first movie i've seen by robert altman, and it has compelled me to seek out his other work, including short cuts, nashville, and cookie's fortune, and now i'm a bonafide fan of his work.<br />anyone expecting a slow moving dull PBS-worthy whodunnit will be pleasantly surprised by how riveting, even moving this film is.<br />as many have mentioned, its plot is focused on the differences and similarities between the upper class and the servants who wait on their every move during a weekend party at a British mansion, circa 1930's.  the upper class have to deal with high social pressures- constant worry about being \\"in\\" the group.  this movie portrays schmoozing as a skilled art.  and if you don't have what it takes, outcast status is always available.  the servants, who operate and live downstairs have their own set of conflicts, most of them revolving around dealing with the snobbery of the folks upstairs.   <br />the acting is utterly fantastic.  kelly macdonald is perfect in the ingenue role of mary, servant to the snobbish trentham (maggie smith).  you might remember macdonald from her role as the love interest in trainspotting.  she shows major star potential in this.  another supreme performance is given by Emily Watson as a servant whos having an affair with the host of the house (Michael Gambon).  Watson's performance is the kind of sublime matching of perfect casting and brilliant acting that makes you realize what a beautiful art form acting in the filmic medium is.  clive owen, helen mirren, alan bates, and ryan phillipe also give superb performances as the servants. <br />the upper class players are equally intriguing.  kristen scott thomas is perfect as the alpha female, the leader and head snob of the group.  anyone whos been among a group of close knit people knows someone like her.  this is ultimately why gosford park is so powerful.  because it thoroughly understands how brutal social life is, and at the same time makes a comment on the the people on the other end of it and how they're problems are so incredibly different yet equally dismal.  <br />i was very impressed by robert altman's directing.  it was his goal to never stop the camera from moving.  so it is, in fact, in constant motion, creating a kaleidoscope effect that only he can deliver.  the script by julian fellowes earned a deserved Oscar.  It creates a rich and interesting group of characters.  the murder-mystery at the heart of it is less important than the character and social class study at work.  gosford park is more concerned with characters than plot which is refreshing.<br />however, one really has to watch this movie with subtitles making the DVD a must have.  the thick british accents and the din of several characters talking at once makes this film very difficult to understand.  however with subtitles, you shouldn't have any trouble.  additionally, the supplemental material is excellent, including a documentary about the real-life butlers and maids who came to consult altman and the cast.  also included is a recording of a Q and A session.  the commentary track by bob balaban, david levy, and robert altman is great too.  altman includes a hilarious tidbit about how he purposely made the actors say the f word in excess to receive an R rated movie because he didn't want kids to say it.  \\"I don't want teenagers to see it.  Especially the teenage boys.  Too much testosterone.\\"  <br />All in all, this is an superb movie and a great DVD to match.  Gosford Park is an absolute must-see
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Over the past six or eight months, people have been telling me that I need to see \\"Memento\\" and that, given some of my other favorite movies, I would most definately enjoy.  While, it is a very good movie, one nagging flaw prevents it from living up to its potential.<br />A quick overview--the main character, Leonard, wants revenge for the murder of his wife.  So, he embarks on a quest for revenge.  The only catch is that since his wife's murder, he has no short-term memory (caused by an injury suffered while attempting to save his wife).  He can no longer remember things.  To aid him, he makes notes, takes photographs, and gives himself tattoos, so that he knows what he has seen and what he is doing.  To enhance this, the director tells us the story backwards, that way, we, much like Leonard, do not know what has just happened.<br />I was reading a review for this movie, by Roger Ebert, and in his review, he brought to light the following question \\"If the last thing Leonard remembers is his wife's murder, then how is it that he knows he cannot form new memories?\\"  This is what did it for me.  This question almost destroys the otherwise excellent plot.  <br />If you discount the flaw, however, and just accept that he just knows, then you are left with a smart and adventurous movie.  The acting is excellent, and the method of story-telling does make you feel like you are in Leonard's shoes.  Discounting the one major flaw, this movie is probably among the best of the year (My vote for 2001, the year this was release, I believe, is the Royal Tenenbaums, but that is a different review).<br />Ulitmately, this is a great movie, that is taken down just a bit by a slip up in writing.  It is well worth the money spent on it, and will provide a thought-provoking, enjoyable experience.
B000002MP2|5.0|Ok, the lyrics are not that unusual, there are a lot of teen-angst bands out there, but remember that this one came out a while ago, so it's a little more original.  It is a very funny album with songs that are catchy, they may sound alike, but at least they all flow.  The order is great in that there is never a feeling of one song really sticking out like a sore thumb.  My personal fave is \\"Basket Case\\" a catchy radio song that is fun to sing and listen to.  I listen to the cd (usually the whole thing) to put me in a good mood (possibly a little perverted, but what the heck?), and it tends to stay the whole day.  I can never get these songs out of my head, and I know almost every word.  I gave it five stars b/c of the overall feel of the cd, which does show a range of emotions.  Even if it is a sad song, it takes some real thinking to make you sad, b/c the songs are upbeat and fun.
B000005J08|5.0|Naked City's &quot;sort of&quot; debut (techinically it is a John Zorn album named Naked City) just may be the best of what John Zorn has to offer, given my limited exposure to his material.  <br />This album veers erratically from one thing to another, manic and insane at one point, then smooth and jazzy the next.  Zorn manages to create his own genre here, and accordingly, this record is as hard to pin down as it is to find.  Not quite as abrasive as his band Painkiller, it makes up for with its diversity and softer, more beautiful moments that Painkiller cannot rival.  <br />This is Zorn at his manic best.  Throw in some movie themes and an Ornette Coleman cover, and you have one of the most amazingly unique listening experiences you will probably ever hear.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is a once in a lifetime album. I can't recommend it highly enough. One hint, though--don't expect a whole lot on the first listening. This album appears deceptively simple initially. The more I hear it, though, the more complex it is. It took me several repeated listenings until the songs started to kick in and reveal themselves. My first run-through left me kind of blank. It wasn't until about the 3rd time that I got chocked up on a couple of songs. A lot of the songs have deeper meaning, and require something from the listener. It's not an album to approach passively. This is the first major post 9/11 work by an artist. And what artistry Bruce Springsteen brings to The Rising. Springsteen is asking something from us with this music. He boldly entreats us to confront our deeper feelings about the devastating toll September 11th and its aftermath have taken on our Country. Springsteen's  songs here have the majesty and power to lift our spirits above the circumstances we all now face in these challenging times. The album is a prayer. In the hands of a lesser artist this could have been a disaster. Instead, it is a triumph. I read in Springsteen's recent interview in Rolling Stone that he believes you have to face the darkness in order to get to the light. That's the function of this album. I guess if one approaches The Rising with a cynic's eye, there's not much point. Save your money. But If you come to it with an open heart and open mind, I think, like me, you will find great meaning here.  The Rising is certainly one of the most moving, spiritual, and inspirational albums of our times.
B000002J03|5.0|Zeppelin 2 is possibly the most drastic revolutionary album that ever came on the rock scene.  Let's face it, most of these songs were too heavy for the top 40.  &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; got played a lot, except they'd leave off the ending (&quot;I wanna be your back door man&quot;).  They cut out the middle too, probably as heavy a stuff as you'll ever hear on a rock album.  And &quot;Living Loving Maid&quot; would have to make my top 40 somewhere as one of the best rock songs ever.  And it doesn't stop there.  &quot;Ramble On&quot; just simply is a great Zeppelin song, &quot;The leaves have fallen all around, time I was on my way&quot;, this song actually does sound great during the Fall.  To someone who had never heard anything by Zeppelin, I would suggest they start with this album.  Untitled has some great stuff on it too but this stuff is raw energy that equals or maybe even tops Van Halen's second album.
0553565915|5.0|There comes a time in our lives when we have to let go of our every day duties and explore the depths of our being.  Sometimes we go through what Betty experienced and are given a chance to make things better with the world.  Beginning with ourselves we see our goodness and our self-centeredness.<br />The near-death experience that Betty went through was not only self-revelation but also very prophetic.  There are many gifts of the spirit but the greatest is love.  It sounds so simple, love one another as He first loved us but it is the hardest of all virtues to practice.  To accept God's unconditional love for us and to give it to other's, one has to let go of the ego, go deeper into the soul and find one's ultimate being.  \\"To be or not to be\\"?
B000002KH3|5.0|Somebody told me back in '79 that I should get VH II. I was living in a town that didn't have anymore than a pop rock station. They played \\"Dance the Night Away\\" and that was it. I listened to II and thought there had to be a \\"I\\". Sure enough, I was right. It's got some great rock songs on it. \\"Atomic Punk\\" was a song I overlooked that is probably my favorite on VH I now. It's probably as good as any of VH's albums. Maybe not quite as refined but a groups first album never is. I was 23 at the time and could relate to some of the lyrics--\\"Got no love, no love you'd call real, ain't got nobody waiting at home\\". \\"Ain't Talkin''Bout Love\\" is a heavy, dark sounding rock sound that packs a hell of a punch. \\"Little Dreamer\\" I think is one of the best songs on VH I that doesn't seem to get much mention. One of my wishes has always been that Van Halen would have made an album with their version of old rock songs. I know they redid a few (You're No Good, You Really Got Me) but I kind of wish they'd done more. Here's some I wish they'd done the Van Halen way: Hungry-Paul Revere & the Raiders, I Had too Much to Dream Last Night-Electric Prunes, Talk Talk-The Music Machine, Dirty Water-The Standells. But that time has past. Looking back now,24 years later I'd have to say that Van Halen I is get down rock and roll just like I told you before..before..before..before..before
B000063DHL|5.0|This is my favourite Iron Maiden album tied with Number Of The Beast. This showcases a very mature and more progressive Iron Maiden, which was certainly a big change in direction. The synths were pretty controversial at the time, but I think they work brilliantly. Somewhere In Time, despite being recorded in the 80s (and sounding like it), has a very spacey, futuristic feel to it.<br />The music is well structured, the melodies are great and the lyrics are well thought out (compared to most metal bands at the time). Tracks like Caught Somewhere In Time and The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner are amazing..., they're all great! The only thing I regret about buying this album is that I didn't buy it sooner.<br />This is a great album. I don't care who said it was ... (one person even said that it was as bad as \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\"). I love this album, and when I first got it it refreshed my love for Maiden's music where even Piece Of Mind didn't when I bought that a few months before. This album shows a real sense of maturity and progression. Don't get me wrong, I like thier older stuff as well, but many bands have either produced a string of albums that sound exactly alike or they've changed for the worse. However, just when Maiden thought that they couldn't top Powerslave, they release this - and it doesn't just sound like an improved version of Powerslave! It's probably Maiden's most most unique album in terms of its sound. Fantastic.
B000002L99|4.0|This album has some good songs on it admittedly, but the energetic, all out, unabated, rock your socks off sound is gone.  Roth is out and Hagar is in and the sound changed dramatically.  I know I don't speak for all Van Halen enthusiasts but I think Van Halen sounded better with David Lee Roth and David Lee Roth sounded better with Van Halen.  I'm not trashing this album, it is good, but its a far cry from their audacious beginning.
1400034779|5.0|Removes you from the bustle of American life and transports you to the dust of Botswana. A simple morality play and clever who-dun-it with each chapter. The simplicity of the language makes it shine.<br /><br />The first two books are the best in the series.  The rest adopt wholesale passages from the previous editions, and are repetitive.
B000002J1F|5.0|This album may take some time to grow on you, it did me. This I decided was probably the most beautiful rock music I've ever heard (if you could describe rock as beautiful). Long Distance Runaround and The Fish sound great, like the rest of this album. I've listened to it driving through the Colorado rockies and can't find anything that beats it. This is not an \\"ordinary\\" rock sound. If you have to depend on hypnotic beats you probably won't like it but this album is a pinnacle in rock history.
0380778556|3.0|it was an interesting book. not the best i've read
B000002VCT|5.0|The only complaint I have about Pyramid is that it's only 38 minutes long.  Alan Parsons became my favorite group (if you could call them a group) after Pyramid.  I bought the record album about a month after it was released in 1978.  I thought it sounded good then.  I listened to it on CD 20 years later on a lot better stereo and now think it is great.  I bought Parsons records as soon as they came out.  Starting with &quot;Tales&quot; through &quot;Gaudi&quot;.  They all sound good, and I know that many Parsons listeners won't agree but I think Pyramid sounds the best.  His first three albums I think stand out from the ones that followed in their uniqueness.  Pyramid has a remarkable beginning and takes you through an experience.  &quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot; is a song that sounds incredible at high volume.  &quot;One More River&quot; and &quot;Can't Take it With You&quot; have related choruses and &quot;Hyper-Gamma-Spaces&quot; gives you a space rock feeling.  The lyrics are thought provoking.  This record has aged well, it doesn't have a &quot;70's&quot; sound.  It can't be associated with any decade.  Alot of thought and effort went into Pyramid, its one of the best albums I've ever heard.
B00003CXGG|3.0|I like Jet Li--not his biggest fan, but I do like the guy and admire his martial arts abilities.  As an actor, he has an appealing presence, but lacks the easy charisma of Chow Yun Fat or Jackie Chan.<br />Having heard so much raving about \\"Romeo Must Die\\" I went into the film with good expectations.  While not a bad film per se, this movie fails to live up to its promise.<br />Li is appealing as the oldest son of Chinese gangster who relocated from Hong Kong to escape a prison sentence.  Li's Han instead went to prison so that his father could take Han's beloved younger brother Po to America.  The Chinese gang headed by Han's father is in an apparent war with the local African American gang.  One of the first casualties of his war is brother Po.  His death causes Han to escape from his Hong Kong prison and come to America to find out who killed his brother.<br />Once stateside, by unlikely coincidence, he hooks up with the daughter of the African American gang leader, played by Aaliyah and together they try to search out the answer to the central mystery of what is really going on--since the gang war seems a smoke screen for something else entirely.<br />Li is appealing as Han, especially in his scenes with Aaliyah, although any romantic attachment that would justify the \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" inspired title and press hype is sadly missing.  The late Aaliyah is surprisingly good in her debut movie role--her loss in the tragic plane crash haunts the viewer as they watch this film.<br />The supporting cast is good and the acting solid.  One stand out performance is by Jon Kit Lee as the doomed younger brother of Han.  He has a precious few minutes of screen time, but what he has he uses to sparkle and dazzle.  I was let down by his character's early demise.  He has a budding charisma that should take him far.<br />The rest of the characters are strangely uninvolving however, and Han's quest seems to lack the immediacy it should have.<br />Flashbacks show that Han was more a father to Po than their father ever was, and that one of the reasons Han went to prison in his father's place was to protect his beloved younger brother and afford him a better life.  The pursuit of his killer falls a bit flat therefore, although there are some interesting scenes along the way.  The best is probably where Li's Han gets suckered into a football skirmish with members of the African American gang and gets the stuffing knocked out of him, until he figures out how to turn the tables.  The game is particularly brutal at first because Li is so small in stature next to the Gang members, who pretty much all could be linebackers for a pro football team.  There are some fairly good fight scenes with Li and Russell Wong and others.<br />But the plot, even the final betrayal falls surprisingly flat.<br />There are also puzzling aspects to the film.  Han's family is said to have come from Hong Kong--no mention of mainland China origins--yet when Chinese is spoken in this film, it is Mandarin, not the Cantonese that is the predominant language of Hong Kong and southern China. Han returns to his brother's apartment at one point in the film, to find it trashed, but seemingly empty. He goes to the garage to find Po's car and finds an important piece of evidence.  He comes back to the apartment to find Aaliyah's character waiting for him in the trashed living room.  Who did the trashing? Presumeably rival gang members looking for evidence--but the juxtaposition of scenes here muddies the water since we are given no indication that is the case.  Since her brother has also just been murdered, it could have been, and possibly was, the gang leader's daughter venting her grief.<br />A minor point, but one that intrudes on the film's narrative.<br />Overall, a predictable, uneven action flick that could have been better had there been more committment to the romantic angle or the \\"Montague vs Capulet\\" idea of warfare between two families.e a father to Po than their father ever was, and that one of the reasons Han went to prison in his father's place was to protect his beloved younger brother and afford him a better life.

B000024D4R|4.0|I like Pink Floyd, from Meddle through Division Bell, with one exception--Animals. I bought this album, tried to like it, but could not succeed. If you like everything Pink Floyd ever did you might like this album, but then again, you might make this one exception. I gave up trying to like this album and gave it away. Whatever it is that people hear on it that they think sounds so good I never discovered. I'm not trying to be cruel, some of it I almost liked. But for someone who hasn't heard it and is considering buying it I think they need to hear the down side as well as the up side. Maybe you'll buy it and love it, I'm not trying to discourage anyone from getting it. I'm just saying that I have 9 Pink Floyd CD's but \\"Animals\\" isn't and never will be one of them.  I will like this album \\"when pigs can fly\\".
B000062X90|5.0|Just a word of advice if you have not heard WA before. Most of their songs begin with slower, more acoustic introductions, and that's what's captured in the short clips you can download here. Unfortunately, you are missing almost all of the incredible guitar work that other reviewers are raving about. <br />To get the idea, just imagine trying to evaluate &quot;Free Bird&quot; by its opening 20 seconds! And one of the songs on this album -- Throw Down the Sword -- has been described as a better example of the &quot;Free Bird&quot; genre than &quot;Free Bird&quot; itself, and possibly even as an inspiration for that song, since it was released several years earlier. Personally, I think it's a lot more polished -- I can listen to Argus over and over and the twin-guitar climax is still amazing every time.
B000002J09|5.0|I'm \\"almost\\" burnt out on this album. Maybe that's because I've heard it\\"almost\\" two million times. Seriously though, this had to be where Zeppelin peaked out. I mean how can you beat this album? Zeppelin has mellowed out slightly, not that you could tell after hearing \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". \\"Rock & Roll\\" still sounds good. \\"Battle of Evermore\\" features some beautiful mandolin (that's what it sounds like anyway) and the vocals near the end are all encompassing. \\"Going to California\\" is one of the most beautiful songs Zeppelin or anyone ever did. To wrap it all up, if you haven't heard this album and like rock & roll it's a must.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson's excellent writing makes \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" a good read. I felt like I was traveling with him and I'm now more knowledgeable about Australia's people, politics, geography and history. Bryson's books are also wonderfully funny. And he doesn't mind making fun of himself. I loved his description of what happens when he falls asleep. \\"I'm not a discreet and fetching sleeper...I sleep as if injected with a powerful experimental muscle relaxant...My head tips forward to empty drool onto my lap, then falls back to begin loading again. And I snore, hugely and helplessly with rubber lips flapping and prolonged steam-valve exhalations.\\" Another of my favorite stories involved Bryson and a friend having too much to drink at a bar. The following morning Bryson asked his friend, \\"Did I disgrace myself?\\" His friend replied, \\"You're doing a house swap next summer with a family from Korea.\\" Bill responds, \\"I pursed my lips thoughtfully. \\"North or South?\\" I asked. When his friend said he did not know Bryson accused him of making the story up.  Bryson said his friend \\"reached over and deftly plucked from my shirt pocket a business card, which he presented to me. It said, \\"Park Ho Lee, Meat Wholesaler\\" or something and gave and address in Pusan. Underneath it, in my own handwriting, it said, \\"June 10-August 27. No worries.\\" I placed the card, folded once, in the ashtray.\\"<br />I also appreciate Bryson's willingness to be a human rights advocate (he brings attention to the plight of the Aboriginal people) and he's a powerful voice for the preservation and conservation of our planet.
6304595247|2.0|Forget this version of Bronte's tale of obsessive love. Even the Olivier version is soft. Check out the hard to find version starring young Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff, possibly 1964 (?). The cinematography is a major player in the drama, as is the haunting soundtrack. I don't understand why the version I praise is not available, for it has truly the best of all elements and it successfully and comfortably balances the demands of the novel's complex plot and the cinematic arts at their most vivid and austere!
0553381709|5.0|I'd never read George R.R. Martin before picking up the first book in this on-going series. Now I wait with baited breath for each new book to arrive. <br />Mr. Martin's prose is tight and engrossing, his character development outstanding, the physical and political scenery of his world detailed and believable. He evokes the environment surrounding each character with such finess you'll hardly notice until you find yourself shivering in the icy cold of the North and fanning yourself in the sweltering warmth of the riverlands in high summer.<br />And the characters! The length of the series has allowed him to bring fantasy character development to new heights! Many of the prime characters mature and change so much by this third book that their behavior, taken out of context, is totally unlike it would have been had a given event occurred in the first book instead. This rare complexity adds tremendously to one's enjoyment of the story.<br />But the most outstanding thing about this intricate, continent-covering series is just how well the man can write. Read any one of these books, then immediately pick up a fantasy book by any other author and try to read it - the comparison in writing ability just blows you away. Bravo, Mr. Martin! PLEASE keep up the fantastic work!
630560973X|5.0|Leonard Nimoy did a masterful job directing this mostly comic episode involving time travel and prior reviews have said, Saving the Whales.  After the very disappointing Star Trek III (sorry, but it was sooo dull after the great Khan), what could be more fun than another time travel episode of Star Trek.  The mom from &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; is Kirk's love interest in this film and she also perfectly suits the tone of the piece.  Another plus is that Mr. Scott, Uhura and other cast members have considerably more to do for a change.  Highly recommended.  Believe the curse  about odd  numbered Star Treks.  Five is the worst of all time.  Three and one were so-so.  Two  and Six (both directed by Nicholas Meyer) and Four (Nimoy) were great.
0792843584|4.0|I must admit, when I sat down to watch this 4 hour epic, I expected the worst. Being familiar with film and one who reads a great deal, I was well aware of the universal vitriol that this movie received when released way back in 1980. I was, however, surprised and slightly angered that this film was so badly received. It contains luscious, panoramic cinamatography, breathtaking meticulously detailed costumes and sets and mesmerising, almost dreamlike acting by it's 3 stars. I think it was due to Cimino's take on American history that provoked such a negative response. It derides the American Dream as one of mutual compromise and discreteness. Quite interestingly, this movie is rated quite highly by British and European critics.

0316666343|4.0|I suppose it would be hard for any book to live up to the early reviews that The Lovely Bones started receiving months before its release. Maybe, if I hadn't heard all the hype, and didn't have to wait so long to finally get it, I wouldn't have been a little let down after reading it.  As others have said, this book had some truly touching moments. After reading about Susie dancing with her grandfather up in heaven, I had to put it down for a while just to preserve that thought. Grandma Lynn's character was a great surprise and so very well thought out.  But I have to admit, I did find myself skimming through pages trying to skip over some of the fluff in order to get to the point of a few of the chapters. And I, too, was disappointed at the ending - when the story started focusing on the old sink whole, you were falsely led to think they would finally wrap everything up - and although the final destiny of Mr. Harvey was a creative link back to an earlier line in the book, a few sentences toward the end of the book surely did not do it justice.<BR>I read the book quickly, it was entertaining, but it certainly wasn't the best book I've ever read.  I will, however, follow Alice Sebold. For this being her first novel, I'd say it was a great accomplishment.
B000068PQ0|1.0|let me start by saying that the flaming lips were one of my favourite bands in the world for years, but now this album came out.i had great expectations for this album, knowing the flaming lips never dissapointed me and just got better with every album they made.it really doesn't bother me that they have this new electronic sound or this big production albums , i think the soft bulletin is their greatest album.its just that the songs on this album are not good at all, well except &quot;Do you realize?&quot;<BR>which is a great song ,the other songs are in a totally different level. the whole album sounds like they jammed in the studio playing cool riffs ,and than Wayne threw some vocals on it.there are even some very embarresing moments on this album when it comes to the melodies.the flaming lips were all about their great song writing ,and it feels like they left it behind and concentrated more on the production and sound.and this is not a reason to make an album ,not for the flaming lips ,anyway.<BR>i just hope that in their next album they'll write the songs first before they go recording it.i really miss the old flaming lips.
6305897786|1.0|I watched this movie when it first came out in the rentals. Now the book was pretty boring and plain but I thought that maybe the movie might make more sense. Well, I was wrong. The movie, if indeed it was a movie, was awful. The main actor portrayed a disgusting waste of life and the main actress portrayed a ...demon [naughty girl]. Overall, the movie made no sense and the film was a complete waste of screen time. Frightening enough, some people that I know stated that they understood it and felt like they could relate to the movie. Do not buy this movie and please do not rent.
B000001ES9|4.0|I am reading some of these reviews with disbelief!  This is a great debut album and &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, &quot;Working Man&quot;, and &quot;What You're Doing&quot; are great tracks.  ENJOY IT! and quit tearing it down as it is an EXCELLENT debut.  BUT, check out &quot;2112&quot; for the best they have to offer...
B00005JKL8|2.0|**1/2 In the opening scene of \\"Behind Enemy Lines,\\" Navy pilot Chris Burnett and his flight buddy - affectionately known as \\"Stackhouse\\" - indulge in a little pre-flight gallows humor as they recall various famous rock performers who have met their ends in plane crashes.  Is it any surprise, then, that these two jocular jocks will face the prospect of a similar fate before too many more scenes have played themselves out?<br />Indeed, it turns out that, not long afterwards, both Burnett and Stackhouse are shot down by the Serbians while flying a reconnaissance mission over what is supposed to be a de-militarized zone in Bosnia.  Only Burnett survives and he is forced to hot foot it over miles of difficult and unfamiliar terrain while being pursued by sniper forces bent on his annihilation.  Gene Hackman co-stars as Burnett's hardnosed - but actually soft-hearted - commanding officer who is forced to decide between keeping the terms of a fragile NATO-imposed peace agreement, thereby leaving Burnett to fend for himself in the wild, or saying to hell with the treaty and rescuing one of his own men as his gut instincts tell him to do.<br />If \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" turns out to be a fairly decent action picture, it is attributable almost entirely to the likeability factor emanating, as always, from actor Owen Wilson.  With his Average Joe persona, Wilson takes Burnett out of the realm of superhero and makes him a character we can identify with - this despite the fact that the number of hairbreadth escapes that Burnett manages to pull off strain our credulity far beyond the breaking point.  Wilson is also aided by the flashy visual technique employed by director John Moore, which helps to cover up the fact that the screenplay has really very little character development taking place under its action-movie surface.  We might also object to the fact that the script never even attempts to come to terms with the complex nature of the Bosnian conflict, choosing instead to reduce the issue to as simplistic a sociopolitical level as possible.  The film also suffers from a sort of built-in monotony factor, endemic to most man-on-the-run narratives.  This is especially aggravated - as it is in this film - when the chase is taking place in a foreign country with very few of the people our hero encounters able to communicate with him much beyond simple phrases and gestures.<br />The cinematography does a tremendous job capturing the stark beauty of the film's bleak, wintertime setting.  Unfortunately, the adrenaline-pumping rock music soundtrack tends to not only undercut the sense of realism created by the photography, but to cheapen the serious and tragic real life events that define the film's historical context.  Perhaps the bitter war in Bosnia is simply too recent and too fresh in our minds to serve as an excuse for yet another rah-rah tale of American ingenuity and virtue.

0446677450|2.0|I'd be willing to bet that 90% of the people that read this book get really excited about earning millions by \\"thinking different\\".  I would also be willing to bet that about the same percentage of readers continue on without doing anything about their newfound enthusiasm.  Why?  Because this book gives absolutely no detail.  This makes sense because nobody is going to sell step by step directions to guarantee millions of dollars in a [price] paperback book.  <br />I did give him 2 stars because he brings a new perspective to money that most people don't learn.  Namely, to spend your efforts aquiring assets and not liabilities, thus allowing your money to \\"work for you\\".  As far as implementation goes, he offers no help besides a few far-fetched real estate deals and investments that he got lucky on.  He makes it sound like a simple trip to the courthouse and 2 hours of time is all it takes to turn a $50k real estate deal.  Ask anybody out there who does these deals regularly to see if its that easy.<br />I also cringed at the idea that he liked his \\"rich dad\\" better simply because he was financially successful.  That is far too materialistic for me.  However, there are some that postulate that \\"rich dad\\" is nothing more than a fictional character, a made up man used to sell the book.<br />What is even more insulting is the realization that comes at the end of the book that he really didn't make is wealth actually doing what he writes about, but rather charging you money to tell you that he did it.  He is simply a salesman, not a dream-maker.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok I love this cd!  I heard it once and loved every single song on the cd!  This young man has moved a 40 year old woman to actually write her first review on this site!  John Mayer is pure genius, he manages to capture very common feelings within his lyrics, ones most of us can relate to...and does it with style!  The tunes are relaxing, catchy, complex, and meld a jazz sound with a pop/rock guitar.  <BR>It is addictive! I get put in the same mood by Sade, it is a sexy, self aware, lush sound that makes you wish you could jump into the cd and be part of the music.  Makes me want to fuse with the tunes and visit the places he brings you emotionally to.  This is oneof my top five favorite cds ever.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Despite the overpraising of PARANOID, this recording stands out to the true listener as Sabbath's best album.  PARANOID had three classic tracks on it, and the remainder of the album was marginally good at best.  But SABOTAGE is consistently good from beginning to finish.<br />Starts off with the contemplative &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;, which are great listens but don't yet make the album the scintillating masterpiece that it is.  That is accomplished with tracks 4 and 5, which are &quot;Megalomania&quot; and &quot;The Thrill of it All&quot;.  The former is one of Sabbath's all-time greatest songs.  A shame they didn't perform it during their reunion tour.  &quot;The Thrill of it All&quot; features some killer Ozzy vocals.  The album is concluded with the melodic &quot;Am I Going Insane&quot; and &quot;The Writ&quot;.<br />Five stars; Sabbath's best album.
0671027344|5.0|I wish I could have Charlie for a friend, too bad he's only a book character.<BR>What he goes through and what he discovers he's gone through truely is more then most teens ever have to deal with, but the process he goes through makes him a strong person in the end and it's so encouraging to read how Charlie survives truths about the past, scorn from classmates and friends and the issue of sex.
0553208845|3.0|First, I should note that the edition of Siddhartha I read was the Dover edition, translated by Stanley Applebaum. As such, the language may be different than in this edition.<br />At times, this seems more like a vain (albeit eloquent) attempt at a philosophical dialogue. Eloquent, and strangely written- at times, it seeems that Hesse is trying to incorporate verse into his prose, and the grammar is often rather odd. But it does have a plot, Siddhartha's quest for Oneness. At first, this meant adhering to the Brahmanic rituals, later he tries the asceticism of the samanas, then encounters the Buddha, and later goes to the other extreme, embracing an Epicurean delight in all worldly things. None of these, however, are ultimately successful. At its end, Siddhartha seems to be an attempt by Hesse to reconcile Eastern metaphysical thought with Western individualism: the ultimate lesson of the novel being that everyone seeks their own path to salvation. It seemed like there was also a kind of suggestive homoeroticism regarding Siddhartha and Govinda- what with Govinda's 'great love' for Siddhartha and Siddhartha's dream where he embraces Govinda (who then turns into a beautiful woman). But that may be my imagination.
B00003CXA2|5.0|The film Forrest Gump is a wonderful modern day fairy tale. It is the story of a simple man stumbling his way through life, but because of his ability to run, leads an extraordinary life.<br />The greatest strength this movie has is how it tells the story spanning a lifetime in only two and a half hours. Nothing feels rushed; the audience just goes from one stage of Forest's life to his next on his quest to find happiness, and to be with his love, Jenny. We feel like we've lived his life along with him. Telling a story spanning almost 40 years effectively like this is not easy, and this movie should be a case study for anyone wishing to do so.<br />The film doesn't try to deal in depth with many of the issues which come up, such as the protest of war, child abuse, woman battering, or AIDS. Some reviews I've read here have criticized it for not dealing with them. But it isn't trying to discuss them. Instead, it's showing how this simple, innocent man is lost in a sea of confusion, not understanding these issues, and so not thinking about them. The audience is shown the world through Forrest's eyes, and to Forrest, there are no issues in life beyond happiness, friendship, and Jenny.<br />Forrest's life is a magical journey like that of Odysseus or Frodo Baggins, but set in our modern world. Yes, the audience has to suspend their belief of a simple guy making it so far in the cruel world. No, it isn't likely, but that's what makes it extraordinary. And it's never meant to mimic probability. That's what makes it a fantasy. And a lovely one at that.<br />The world could use more Forrest Gumps.
0812550706|5.0|Whether you like science fiction or not, this book is very worthwhile reading. Its well-written and provactive with a great storyline. It is especially interesting for teens and young adults in gifted-and-talented school programs.<br />The sequels do not live up the original, unfortunately.
0446364495|5.0|I am in my mid 20's and have just begun reading novels and such.  My mother actually lent me her copy of BOMC and I was skeptical about it.  I have never read romance novels or anything like that, never thought that I would like it, but this book changed all that.  I could not put this book down.  It was powerful and sensitive, wonderful and magical.  It was so many things, it's hard to describe.  I actually wanted to read it again as soon as I finished it.  I was sad that it was over so quickly, I actually can't wait to read the epilogue.  To anyone who is pondering reading this book, please do, you won't be sorry.
0767817982|5.0|blue thunder remains one the best action flicks for one simple reason.  the action scenes are real and not contrived special effects.<BR>when you see the helicopters flying all over los angeles in this movie you can tell it is REAL.  the L.A. river chase sequence is a classic piece of aerial orchestration.  roy scheider learned how to fly a helicopter for this movie and it shows.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I enjoyed the suspense and the visual of this movie. <br />If I have to make a meaning out of the movie, I would say I do agree that in everybody's illusion, one's self image is always positive and innocent, and everyone wants to rationlize and make sense out of what he/she has become and what is happening in his/her life, even by making lies.  <br />For this exact irony, I didn't bother to try to rationalize and make sense out of this movie. Isn't it what the movie teaches us?
B000062TU1|3.0|This movie had it been released at a different time during the year, or a different year it would have been much better and recieved a much higher rating. So let me explain myself. The director's adaptation was weak at best, and left the true Harry Potter fans wishing for more.  Who is Hermione Granger, where does she come from, how about Draco Malfoy,  all we know is that Hermione and Harry are friends and Draco and Harry are not.  Why does Draco hate Hermione and Ron so much?  There are so many plot holes you could drive a fleet of Mack trucks through them.  Yes I know that there are going to be a lot more movies coming out and they have to introduce the characters slower than in the books, but still they should have provided a background of some of the students. <BR>With that said the acting was only ok.  Very rarely could I even sense the hatred that Draco Malfoy has for Hermione and Ron, and feelings that Harry, Ron, and Harry have for Snape and Malfoy.  Granted the acting is done primarily by children, so hopefully with time they will become better at staying in character and following character true to the books. Stone is so recent that the majority of moviegoers have read the book, and Stone leaves out quite a bit of information and skips very good scenes. Because of this Harry Potter die hard fans did not like the movie.  Also the special effects team had a great opportunity to impress the audience through the Quidditch matches, however it was too short, and in all honestly didn't look real.  My desire and the desire of many is to actually feel what it would be like to ride a broomstick and dive for the golden snitch!  Luckily they now have opportunities to make the effects better and develop the characters more in Chamber.
B000002HAF|5.0|I think the title of the 12th track sums up this album, and the Pixies career in general:  \\"I'm Amazed\\".  Pixies are my favorite band, and this album is just another great reason why I praise them as much as I do.  If you noticed why this is Pt. I, well it's because, in my oppinion, the two greatest albums are this, and \\"Never mind the Bollocks Here's the...\\" by Sex Pistols.  For further information, check that review.  Anyway, on to \\"Surfer Rosa\\"...<br />This album is fuming with originality, ferocity, and some of the greatest bass lines/guitar riffs to ever come out of music.  Ever song on the C.D. is listenable; and when I say listenable, I mean that they're all classics, not that you can listen to them just because they are there.  Although, my personal favorites on this album are \\"Where is My Mind?\\", \\"Gigantic(The only song with vocals by a female I like)\\", and \\"Bone Machine\\".  For further listening, \\"Doolittle\\" and \\"Bossanova\\" are required musts.  As far as the album itself is concerned, the vocals from Black Francis are amazing; he's got a voice that you can love, or it can haunt you.  The bass lines from bassist Kim Deal(who sings on a few tracks), are great.  The opening to \\"Gigantic\\" is, in my oppinion, the greatest sound to ever come from a bass.  Not saying that Joey Santiago's guitar isn't mesmerizing.<br />The album is great on every level, and deserves to be in any record collection by anyone who says they enjoy music.  If I had to sum up my feelings for this song, I'd steal a lyric or two from \\"Gigantic\\", calling my obsession with the album \\"A big, big love\\".
B00005JKL8|4.0|Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie with the same holes and problems that one finds with any movie that simulates real life military operations.  The storyline is just great it moves quickly and the movie is really over before you even know it.  It follows the experiences of a Navy navigator pilot (played by Owen Wilson).  When his plane is shot down and his pilot murdered Burnett must do everything he can to stay alive.  Although there are several very corny lines by Gene Hackman the movie has generally a very good plot.  If you enjoy watching Owen Wilson this is a great movie.
0792833260|5.0|'Rain Man' is a wonderful story of acceptance, loss, brotherhood, and love.  It's a touching drama without that sappy, tear-jerker quaility that many such dramas tend to have.  The story follows a money-hungry, arrogant, young businessman (Tom Cruise), who discovers after his father's death that millions of dollars in the father's will have been put aside for a brother that the man never knew he had.  Dustin Hoffman stars as Raymond, the autistic savant brother who teaches the businessman important lessons about life, love, and understanding.  A classic, not to be missed!
B000068PQ0|4.0|The first time I heard the Flaming Lips occurred while watching the movie &quot;Batman Forever.&quot;  I thought the use of &quot;Bad Days&quot; was particularly funny in the movie's context, and I bought the soundtrack.  Fast forward several years.  I hadn't heard anything about the Flaming Lips since I bought the previously mentioned soundtrack, and had pretty much forgotten about them, when, lo and behold, an ad for &quot;Yoshimi&quot; appeared on MTV2.  The critical soundbites included were very nice, of course, but I was so amazed by the thirty second snippet of &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; that I immediately purchased the album, despite the fact that it is usually my policy to wait until I hear 2 or 3 complete songs from an album before buying it.<br />This album was well worth the risk.  I love groups that mix pop/rock with electronica (Gorillaz, Garbage, No Doubt's 4th album) but with &quot;Yoshimi,&quot; the Flaming Lips add layers of depth one would expect to find in Radiohead or Tool.  This gives them the rare ability to entertain on all levels; that is, the pop hooks are catchy enough to work on the level of mainstream pop (though &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; will probably get zero U.S. airplay), but for those who wish to dig deeper, the rewards are great.<br />All the tracks are very good, with the weakest being the title tracks.  I'll admit it, the first time I heard them, I thought they sounded corny and out of place on such an inspired record, and it took several listens to get used to them.  The other downside is that it loses some of its grandeur when you aren't in a bittersweet mood.  But other than that, this album has no flaws.  4.5 out of five.
0446608955|5.0|This book was that first book that i have read by Nicholas Sparks. Once you start it you cant put it down. The story is about 2 seventeen year old who try not to fall in love that go though trills. But i not going to give away what happends becaue then there would be no use in reading the book. If you are look for a christian base book that also has romance you will love this book.
B0000029LG|5.0|LISTEN PEOPLE, the second cd is just as good as the first one! It is packed with great songs with a strong message for each one. <BR>  THEY DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT US,is a powerful song with a great rythym and beat to it that is catchy and you won't get tired of it. STANGER IN MASCOW is a emotional yet beutiful song that is one of my favorites and is considered a classic by many. And not to mention YOU ARE NOT ALONE, SCREAM and EARTH SONG,that were #1 hits in the billbord charts  . Also MOney and 2BAD are powerful songs with great beats but with meaning.And if you ever wondered what Michael sounds like when he curses (sh**) THIS TIME AROUND is the song for you.<BR>    If you have hered about buying History and throwing the second CD away, don't listen!! There nothing but a bunch of Michael Jackson haters! And hey, I'm not a hardcore fan of mj.Yet ian a fan, but I too didn't think Invincible was that great.But I know good music when I here it. And the whole set of History is a classic!! Even The second CD!!
B000002513|5.0|Bruce Springsteen won me over forever in 1973 with this album.  I went to see him perform as an opening act for Dr. John in Santa Monica as a result of this album.  My college roomate had a big quadrophonic stereo system that he'd use for dorm dances, and the one demand I made on him for helping him carry his stuff downstairs was that we could play &quot;Rosalita&quot; and &quot;Kitty's Back&quot; at every dance.  All the kids at first would stop dancing, because it was the only unfamiliar stuff we'd play, but by the last dance, I had people lining up to find out who made this great music.<br />Bruce took the expansive, poetic, musical pastiche style of this album forward with &quot;Born To Run,&quot; but then after that album, he decided to focus his artistry on shorter songs with tighter lyrics and clear, understandable points of view.  So in many ways, this album represents the road not taken.  But it exists, it's still in print, and it's a classic.<br />Some have objected to how it was recorded, and also to the relatively weak playing of the old drummer, Vini Lopez.  Points conceded, but they don't mar the brilliance and enjoyability of this album.  The pianist, David L. Sancious, more than makes up for any deficiencies by playing the most outrageous piano backup I've ever heard.  As fine as Roy Bittan is, Sancious' departure from E Street for a career in jazz-rock fusion was a musical tragedy.  Listen to his opening for &quot;NY City Seranade&quot;--Chopin meets Gershwin, easing into a beautiful duet with acoustic guitar that is otherwordly.  Elsewhere, he provides Bruce with all the rhythmic support his drummer couldn't.<br />It is unbelievable that this seemingly inarticulate kid was able to pack so much American musical heritage into one inexpensively produced album, and in the process create new musical molds.  And, as romantic and poetic as some of this album is, most of it is very lighthearted and fun, capturing better than any of Bruce's other albums the spirit of the great entertainer that his live shows have always displayed. This album is Bruce's cheeseburger deluxe--greasy and sizzling, with smoke rising into the summer ocean air, spreading delight everywhere.<br />My fondest hope would be that, one day, Bruce would return to this style, adding a few musicians who could help him bring it off, maybe even bringing Sancious back into the fold.  On Nightline, it sounded like he was trying to write a few in that style when &quot;The Rising&quot; was in the works.<br />Failing that, if he would just do us the favor of one day performing &quot;New York City Serenade&quot; live on TV...then he'd really impress people.he spirit of the great entertainer that his live shows have always displayed.

B000066NW0|4.0|The first time I listened to it, I was just geting a feel for the songs, and was skeptical. It just took another listen before I was hooked. I'm trying my best to learn all the words!!<br />Losing Grip - This is a very good song. It's hard, and shows some emotion. It also expresses her vocal talent. 9/10<br />Complicated - This is an excellent song, and obviously the best song to release as a single. It's WAY overplayed on the radio...not her fault, I realize. 9.5/10<br />Sk8er Boi - What can I say? It tells a story. It's very good. However after listening to it for a few times, though it's still catchy, it almost feels like you &quot;know the ending&quot;. 8/10<br />I'm With You - A ballad. This is a great one. This is one of the songs that you are supposed to relate to, and most of us do. 9.5/10<br />Mobile - This song is extremely catchy. Though it has a touch of &quot;cheesy&quot;-ness in it. I like it a lot. 8.5/10<br />Unwanted - When it starts out it's a little skewed, but the chorus just grabs you doesn't let go. It also has a great message. It's like...it's easier for someone to ignore you than get to know you, and you dont think it's fair. 9/10<br />Tomorrow - Not one of my favorites, but a beautiful song with a rather intense chorus. 8/10<br />Anything But Ordinary - The message in this song is sort of corny. It's well put, but not very &quot;deep&quot;. Catchy, nonetheless. 7/10<br />Things I'll Never Say - Wow. That's what I have to say. Wow. This is a fantastic song. I can NOT stop listening to it. It's too hard to discribe why I love it, but...ohh I just do. 10/10<br />My World - Another corny one. Ok, corny is the wrong word. It's CASUAL. It's not really about much, just a bit about her past and that she spaces out sometimes. Very &quot;pop-y&quot;, but also very catchy and up-beat. 7/10<br />Nobody's Fool - No. Someone should have slapped her for even thinking about making this song! She is not a rapper. She does not have a rapping gene in her. Thesaving grace of this song is that the chorus is sung, and quite well. It's a great chorus. 4/10<br />Too Much To Ask - This one has a good message behind it. The tune itself is not bad, but not the best. It's a little sloppy, but, like the rest of her songs, still catchy and overall a good song to listen to. 7.5/10<br />Naked - Yes, this is a great song. Everyone is right, this song just rules. It's about feeling vulnerable, especially when around a certain person. It's a good song. Plain and simple, it is a very good song. 9.5/10<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Well, after working it out on my calculator, I see that my overall rating for &quot;Let Go&quot; is ----- 8. That's about right.<br />It IS a good album, and I give her credit for it. I hope nothing but good things for Avril in the future. <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />(By the way, someone told me she sounds like Alanis, and at first I couldnt hear it, but when I listened again, she absolutely does. Then I noticed that everyone in the world thinks the same thing. LoL)
B00005JKJA|3.0|I am a Lynch fan, and expected to enjoy this film. Which I did, I think. See, every twenty minutes of watching I would jump between two extremes - loving the movie, and then hating it. At times I told myself I have to buy this tomorrow (I rented it), and then I'd be wrenched with horrible disgust, I'd want to stop it and break the dvd into bits.<br />As a movie, I don't want to own it. But, usually if a movie invokes a strong emotional response, it's great - right? I don't know - you just have to watch it. It was a good movie because it made me feel so much. It was like a roller coaster (for lack of a better comparison).<br />It picks at your brain. If you want to experience this, watch this movie.
B0000399WI|5.0|I am certainly not a Stephen King Fan.  In fact, if I had known that he was the author of this incredible story I probably would have missed out on one of the best movies I have EVER seen.  And yes, that is saying something. There's a plot... and like all good movies, the movie compels your mind to participate, without stressing those sometimes delicate neurons.  This is a completely believable story done with a spectacular cast.  I have watched it so many times I may need to purchase a second DVD in case the first one becomes too used.  A definite for any buff's collection... and a YES for any fan of cinema and/or plot.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Like the fantastic movie, the soundtrack was equally brilliant. Normally not a fan of musical acts, I am in love with the music and movie Moulin Rouge. The soundtrack is full of amazing pieces of music, and is one of my favorite CDs. The songs express such love and truth that I don't know how anyone could ever not like the music. This CD is definetly worth ever cent.
B000003N89|5.0|Diana Krall is incredible!<br />I have all of her cd's and just ordered the DVD of her live performance.  I even saw her perform in Chicago in 2000.  She has revitalized what was once a sagging music genre.<br />So, why should you buy THIS CD?  Because this is true beauty... a tribute to one of the greats in music and it is done right by Diana!  It's obvious she has a love for the work.  If it were possible for sunshine and smoke to combine in an audio tone the result would be the sound of Diana Krall's voice.<br />:o)
B000002H70|5.0|I am a Cure-fan since A forest came out in our country and made it all the way up until last year's Greatest Hits package. But 1989's Disintegration is the Cure at their height... Every musiclover on this planet must have a copy of this one. This album is full of melancholic songs and it's all so well-glued together that it makes a whole theme, even if it's not necesarry sometimes. My first album which I bought was Mixed Up (1990), which, ofcourse, has a lot of remixes from Disintegration. After that one, I bought the rest of their nineties stuff AND Staring at the sea. But it was this album which re-defines the words melancholy, depression, loneliness, failure, hopelessness, fear, rejection, disappointment, angryness, gothic and coldness... My favourites are Pictures of you and Plainsong, but every track is PERFECT. Don't even dare to skip this one or you will never find out what it is to really feel down and how to go UP again!!...

B0000640VO|5.0|Believe the hype on this one, folks. It's a touching love story, but at it's heart the film is about ALL joy in life. Finding joy in the details. And the DVD is truly exceptional. 2 documentaries, Q&amp;A sessions from 2 film festivals, screen tests, director's commentary and production art. Definitely one of the top 3 DVDs in my collection.
B0000640VO|4.0|A truly wonderful film. Throughout the opening sequence, in which the cast of unique characters is introduced, I laughed at the originality of their character traits.  Within two minutes, you feel as if you truly know everyone in the film as a close friend.  This closeness makes the rest of the surprisingly long film fly by.  At least a half-dozen sub-plots, (really just amusing anecdotes acted out), provide laughter and poignancy to the film.  At the end you are happy for Amelie as she finds love, and happy for having spent two hours with such a pleasing film.  The enchanting, fairy-tale music will be in your head afterward, and the next day as you think of the film, a smile will come across your face.
0316666343|5.0|I seldom read a book.  I have a large farm, and am a workaholic and watch movies, because they are done with quickly and then I can get back 'to work'.<br />By chance, I had read several reviews of \\"The Lovely Bones\\", and was very drawn to the story.  Several years ago, I worked with a local \\"People Against Rape\\" organization as a volunteer.  I also have two lovely grown children.  I always thought that a parent's worst nightmare would be a situation like this; your child abducted or missing, and you don't know what is happening to that child. <br />Usually, I go for the thriller-diller crime stories.  Murder/mayhem/mystery. When I ordered this book, I wondered if it would be a bit maudlin.  I'm agnostic and don't believe in Heaven or Hell. This book is written by a young girl looking down from Heaven on the world which she has left, and the events taking place in that world, and the events that lead her to her death, and her \\"Heaven\\".<br />Alice Sebold can WRITE!  I started this book in the morning, and barely got out to feed the farm animals that day.<br />The book is a \\"page turner\\". And, tough farm lady that I am, it caused me to shed a few tears.<br />I hope that Ms. Sebold writes another novel.  I'll be first in line.
0446608955|5.0|This book was so beautifully written. I enjoyed every minute. I have never ever cried over a book before, and anything that can make me cry like that has to be good! Its the best book I have read, and I definetly recommend it to anyone of any age. Its lovely, and there is something we can all learn from it...when you find your true love, it will last forever!!!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|While I am in no way Britney's biggest fan,I love this album!I have all three of her CDs and this is BY FAR the best one!She is totally maturing and that's obvious.I also recommend Aaliyah,Christina Aguilera,and Jessica Simpson!
B00005TT77|4.0|I am a huge Beatles fan, and - unlike some - I love to hear their music interpreted by other artists. <br />The key word here is INTERPRET.  If we wanted to listen to an EXACT COPY - we could just put on the original Beatles records now couldn't we?   <br />I adored this soundtrack.  Every song, save one, was great in it's own way.  I loved The Two of Us, We Can Work it Out, and Blackbird the most - but they were all just lovely interpretations.<br />All but Revolution.  I didn't enjoy that at all - and wouldn't even if it wasn't a Beatles cover.  Not sure what the artist was thinking...... wow, really out there - - it's a wonderful powerful song - he just turned it into mush.<br />Also, this is a SOUNDTRACK folks...... it's not people trying to copy or upstage the Beatles....jeez louise.  As a soundtrack it does a top notch job.  I listen to it - and am brought right back to the movie (great great great movie) - not all soundtracks capture their movies' theme so well.<br />Overall - I would disagree with many here - it's an outstanding soundtrack, most all the songs are inspiring (some even rival the originals - OH MY GAWD! - did I just say that? - may the Beatle police lock me up and throw away the key!)
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is great!My favorite song is \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\"!I also recommmend any other cd by Eminem:The Marshall Mathers LP,The Slim Shady LP,and Devil's Night(D-12).For all of you R&B people I recommend Aaliyah's latest CD,Aaliyah.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|i was very happy with this album since it is without question the best maiden album since 7th son of a 7th son. the band seems fresh and much more creative. my only complaints are that it seems that with songs such as the wicker man and the thin line between love and hate iron maiden gives out a kind of modern rock feel. I also think that janick gers needs to leave. Yes i know he can play fast, but who cares, his solos are just masturbatory and have no feeling. Adrian and Dave can do much better by themselves. Anyway its still a great cd
B00003CXE7|4.0|One piece of advice: If you ask someone their name and they respond with 'Gladiator', you should probably run for the hills because there is a good chance that you will get your sorry carcass kicked up and down the field of battle.  The movie was great [I refuse to address the new caeser's infatuation with his sibling...except to say... yuck].  I only wish that we could have seen `Maximus Decimus Meridius' once again get command of his troops and tear Rome a new one.
B000063DHL|5.0|This album along with 7th son is my favorite iron maiden album. from the intro of the first song, caught somewhere in time, to the final notes of alexander the great it is flawess. I know that many people say that it is too futuristic for maiden and uses keyboards but i say that this is a good thing. The keyboards really provide a new level of texture and ambience to the music.Just because its progressive does not mean that its not heavy. It just means that they tried to be more melodic. And I think they succeeded.The guitar work is fantastic. Adrian and Dave really are the two most compatible guitarists in heavy metal. Each solo is emotional and melodic(my favorite is the solo on stranger in a stranger land. I highly reccomend this cd.
0425098478|4.0|\\"The One Minute Manager\\" is about finding the balance between being an autocratic manager who cares only about the results, and a democratic manager, who cares only about the people.  <br />The authors use the parable of a young man on a quest to find a truly effective manager.  In his search, he meets the One Minute Manager, a willing mentor who seems to have things well in control and plenty of time on his hands.<br />During the course of the story, the young man finds that a good manager is an honest, straight-shooter, that really cares for his people.  According to his mentor, the process for ensuring this can be boiled down into three rules.<br />1. Make and set One Minute Goals.  Keep them short, simple, and easily measured.<BR>2. Give One Minute Praise.  Try and catch your folks doing things right.<BR>3. Give One Minute Reprimands. Do it immediately. Talk only about the incorrect behavior.  Then remind them how valuable the are to the organization. <br />The key to using these rules is to be consistent.  Rely on people to do their best.  Let them know when they do.  And, let them know when they don't.  The result will be a work group that is individually more responsible.  The reward for you is that you will have happier employees and more time for planning, organizing, etc.<br />Two additional notes from personal experience.  First, whenever possible, praise folks where their teammates can see.  Unless the staff person is adverse to public attention (in which case, praise in private), the recognition is valuable to both you and your staff.  They feel good about their work and you get more productivity from them and their teammates-remember you get what you reward.  Second, reprimand in private.  Public humiliation is very destructive.  A reprimand, no matter how well deserved or how well intentioned will be viewed as humiliation if done publicly. <br />I think you'll find this book an excellent addition to your library.  It is a very quick read.  The rules are simple to remember, and make a lot of sense.  Unfortunately, they are not quite so easy to implement, but they do work.  You will find the results well worth the effort.
B000063DFQ|4.0|this was my first iron maiden album. I did not know anything about maiden and i had no idea if would be good or bad. so i put it in and pressed play and i was blown away. The intro to the first song is so powerful that it put me in trance for the whole album. THis album is full of great songs like Where Eagles Dare, The Trooper, Flight of Icarus, etc. Unfortunaltey it also has two mediocre songs: quest for fire and sun and steel. I used to think that this was the greatest album ever and that nothing was better but now that i have heard other maiden albums i can only give this album 4 stars because there are other maiden albums that are superior. I highly reccomend that you buy this album since i can promise you that you wont be dissapointed.
0446678430|5.0|After reading several of these Rich Dad books including Retire Young, Retire Rich as well as many of the reviews here on Amazon.com, it is easy to spot the reviewers who have a chance of being rich and the reviewer who will be stuck in the same rut they are in. Those who rated 4-5 stars are embracing the new concept and those with 1-2 stars think they know it all already. This series of books is excellent. There is much repetition, but it is important to keep driving the message home. One read may not sink in. There a lots of books about \\"how-to-do\\" these books are about \\"how-to-think\\"
B000063DFN|3.0|i really think that this is the worst maiden cd from the years 1980-1987. Maybe i was expecting so much from it( i had already heard number of the beast and piece of mind) that it was dissapointing. Honestly i think the worst part of the album is the drumming. It seems to me to be almost catatonic and very uninteresting. So i guess im try to say that the rythm on this album is not as powerful as it usual is with iron maiden.I was also very dissapointed wiht 3 songs: back to the village, the duellists and losfer words. These songs just make me say blah. They are just boring songs. Of course the album still has 5 good songs. My favoirte is the rime of the ancient mariner(one of the best moments in heavy metal history is the part after bruce sings something like &quot;and down comes the rain&quot;) I think that aces high and 2 minutes to midnite are good songs too, but not masterpieces. Dont think that i dont like iron maiden, i love them, but i feel that this was an album of commercial heavy metal because most of the songs just follow a pattern(such as intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, verse, chorus)so that there arent many interesting surprises( really the only songs that have various interesting sections are the rime of the ancient mariner and powerslave.Fortunately this happened only on this album as somewhere in time and 7th son were masterpieces I still reccoment that if you like iron maiden you should get this album because it is worth buying but if you have never heard maiden before i reccomend you get a different album.
0553103547|5.0|The title speeks for itself, truly...<br />No writer has ever depicted a realm of such magic, intrigue, mystery, complexity, brilliance and perspective so realistically that a piece of your mind is utterly absorbed into the World of Westeros and everything beyond. This book will change you. His characters are so realistically made that they will actually reflect upon those you see in reality, and I tell it true. You might even dream of this world. He even stresses the role of women, and incredibly well.<br />This is a story of tragedy, treachery and conspiracy. The Seven Kingdoms bestir themselves as its great Houses dispute, with word and sword. Families plot against families, in clandestine meetings. The shall slowly crumble as you will witness if you read...and read well, VERY well.

B000069HKH|4.0|Let's face it -- giving this album 5 stars (as one reviewer here does) because Bon Jovi would have liked to have made this album is damning with very faint praise.  And the inclusion of &quot;Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)&quot; is reason enough to dock a star.  The disappearance of Roy Bittan is worth another half -- so 3 1/2 stars, here, rounded up.  All in all this is a solid anthemic album, with several truly great songs (Lonesome Day, Empty Sky, Worlds Apart, My City of Ruins), some good party songs a la The River (Mary's Place).  Bruce settled a little too easily on &quot;la, la, la&quot; choruses, I think. But there are some terrific nuggets here, lyrically and musically, that both soar and niggle at you. Well worth a place in your CD changer.
B00005OAIE|5.0|If you've heard the song &quot;No Such Thing&quot; playing on radio stations across the USA this summer, you have a good idea what John Mayer's entire album is about...it's about not conforming, it's about reaching for more, it's about feeling deep things and not being afraid to be an artist. As a fellow artist, I can tell you that this CD has encouraged me to follow my own path, and that may not necessarily be the safe path.  Looks like we have a &quot;Young James Taylor&quot; on our hands here-John, I look forward to hearing from you for years to come.
0743216458|5.0|As a 40 year old with a B.A. in History I was one of the millions whose interest in WWII was re-ignited by Saving Private Ryan. From childhood through college I read everything I could lay my hands on D-Day,the Battle of the Bulge,The Nazis etc. The movie led me to read Ambrose's D-Day,Then Band of Brothers. If you ignore some of Ambrose's comments about this being the finest, best light infantry company in the world, this is a great story. As great as their accomplishments on D-Day and in Bastogne, The 101st Airborne was only ONE of the US Army divisions that fought in Europe. the 82nd had already jumped in Sicily and Italy by the time the Screaming Eagles jumped and the All Americans also fought on D-Day and in the Bulge. Nevertheless Ambrose tells a great story and brings the characters in this story to vivid life. The TV series is also outstanding. if you fall in love with Band of Brothers read the memoir of one its members; Daniel Kenyon Webster, whose Parachute Infantry is a darker more bitter account of the same story. Also Donald Burgett was in Company B, 506th PIR and he has written 4 GREAT books: Curahee!, Road to Arnhem, Seven Roads to Hell and Beyond the Rhine.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Not a box-office smash, this film is for people who enjoy storyline over special FX/car chases etc.<br />The film starts with the end of the story & works its way back. You are kept guessing the whole time.<br />Carrie-Anne Moss manipulates Guy Pearce who, following the traumatic death of his wife, can not form new memories.<br />This film is great
0380817683|5.0|One of the most entertaining books I've read in a very long time.<BR>Not only did I truly enjoy the story and its characters, I am in love with Marian Keyes' writing style.

B00005JKLZ|2.0|Like the previous (&amp; superior film starring Rod Taylor -also an Australian), this film only partly follows the excellent H G Wells book. Only in this film a large chunk is devoted to a pre-story trying to explain why Guy Pearce invents the time machine in the first place.<br />This film has many stupid plot twists - why would a cannibalistic Morlock let Guy Pearce walk away (instead of eating him perhaps)?<br />Even the star, Guy Pearce said that this film is terrible.
0316666343|3.0|I live in the UK and received this book as a birthday present from my sister-in-law in Cincinnati. Not one I would have chosen for myself (and indeed it hasn't been released here yet), but having started, I needed to finish. I read it in just over 24hrs - it's easy to read and interesting/challenging/well written enough to have you turning the pages quite quickly. Here comes the 'but'... I felt left unsatisfied, wanting to understand a little bit more from each chapter and character. I can't tell whether the Author deliberately leaves us wondering: because neither Susie, nor her family and friends have all of the pieces to fit together; or whether the author didn't have the imagination to develop the characters further and in their own right. So, it's either a very clever portrayal of how bitty and unresolved our lives can be when such a tragic event takes place, or the Author isn't experienced enough in developing sympathetic and fully rounded characters. I'm inclined to believe the latter since the last few episodes take on an aura of soap-like nonsense - things are resolved - but not quite, and not in the way we'd expect - For example, Susie's occupation of her class-mate's body was a) not what I expected, and b) not used for the purposes I would have expected.<br />Incidentally, reading the book took on a certain poignancy as, as I was reading the last few pages, news of the disappearance of two little 10 year old girls broke. A week later they still haven't been found and I am struck by comparisons of policing methods employed here/now and in the book. Were police officers really so lax in the 70's or were we all just more naive?<br />The book is very well written and the Author certainly has a talent for using words. There are some inconsistencies, however, in particular in the tone and vocabulary used by Susie. At times she is a naive teenager, at others an articulate adult. On reflection, I can't help but wonder at the extent to which this novel is really a form of autobiographical catharsis. In summary, it is certainly an 'experience' but it is not a book to put towards the top of a summer reading list.of autobiographical catharsis. In summary, it is certainly an 'experience' but it is not a book to put towards the top of a summer reading list.
B00004VVNB|4.0|Although there's only a PG rating this film is for those who like films with a story.<br />Jenny Agutter &amp; Michael York team up together again (they're also in &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;). This film was so good that they re-made it for TV &amp; then there was an entire tv series based on it.<br />(Jenny Agutter; I've always had a crush on her since I saw a lot of her in &quot;Walkabout&quot;).
B00000JY1X|5.0|Buy this album! It's nearly impossible to categorize because the songs are, at once, quirky, smart, completely original and beautiful written. That the same man could write \\"Come Back from San Francisco'' and \\"Fido,Your Leash is Too Long'' is unbelieveable. Stephin Merritt is a remarkable, just-under-the-radar talent. And the band ain't half bad either.
B000001GXJ|5.0|For my part, I have never understood why Simon Boccanegra has not enjoyed the same praise and love that Verdi's other great operas have.  Yes, the opera was an initial flop but was the libreto was reworked years later by no less than Boito and this version was a huge success.  Yes, the logic of the story leaves something to be desired, but hey, it's opera, since when has that gotten in the way?<br />This is one of my favorite Verdi operas and I would take it any day over Traviata, Trovatore, or even Aida.  The tenors often get the headlines in Verdi Operas, but I would agree with an earlier reviewer that Verdi really understood the low male voices and Simon, like Don Carlo, brings that out.  There is a darkness and pathos that runs throughout this work.  There is also great passion, both anger: 'Suona Ogni Labbro Il Mio Nome' as well as love and tenderness:'Orfanella Il Tetto Umile'...'Figlia!...A Tal Nome Io Palpito'. <br />This recording is a great rendition of a great opera. Cappuccilli's voice is well suited for Simon and brings the complexity that this roles demands. I enjoyed Jose van Dam's Paolo, (the &quot;Iago&quot; in this story) which is dark and menecing. Ghiaurov is simply fantastic as the tortured Fiesco as are Carreras and Freni as the young lovers.<br />This is a must recording for any opera lover.  Great cast. Great Opera.

The common themes I love in horror flicks are crew trapped by some uknown terror with lots of weapons and they have to figure out a way out and blasting hundreds of creepers only pisses them off.  Furthermore, the crew gets devasted and ripped to shreds one by one.  Man thats just too much fun.  Well this film delivers the suspense and action in this one.  This movie plus aliens has delivered he formula for monster suspense better than any other action thriller flicks.  For the editorial who said that this movie wasnt origanal and even the bashed the director is a total [...].  Its true that its not an entirely original film but its a really fun film with lots of action.  What more can you ask?...
B0000399WI|5.0|Oh, my...where do I start? When this movie first came out, I just did not want to go see it. I am just not a fan of prison-type movies. So when my friend and I really didn't have anything to do one night, we ordered pizza and rented this movie. I was absolutely mesmerized from start to finish. It wasn't a prison movie at all! It was all about how the human spirit can survive and thrive anything that it is given. True, not all of us pull upon our inner resources, but this movie demonstrates the unalterable truth that there is something deep within us that can get us through anything.<br />It is hope.<br />Hope gets us to look just a little bit beyond the self-inflicted prisons we have all put ourselves in at one time or another. If we can just let a glimpse of something better take root in our mind, we will find a way out of any kind of situation we find ourselves in. <br />Many of you are probably saying, &quot;Hey, dude...it's only a movie...&quot; And if you watch it as just another movie, you get what you deserve...but if you are willing to see it as symbolic and metaphorical of everyday life, I invite you to experience a very wonderful kind of film. It is absolutely lovely and magnificently crafted. Soul is indelibly printed on each frame of celluloid. I loved it...I love it...and you will, too!
0738206679|5.0|In all the chapters (author calls \\"links\\"- a novel idea for a book on networks!) Barabasi has nicely stitched the captivating overviews on different networking details and offer a general progressing view about network analysis. He used the \\"World Wide Web network\\" as a basis for network analysis and extended the findings to other possible real-world networks (cellular-proteins, diseases, network of actors at Hollywood, terrorist networks, web of scientists linked with co-authorship, collaborative web behind economy and so on).<br /><br />As pointed in introduction, \\"reductionism\\" was the buzzword of twentieth century\\"s research based on the assumption \\"that once we understand parts, it will be easy to grasp whole\\" but the reassembly turned out to be harder leading us into \\"complexity\\". Barabasi projects the concept to the nodes of a network and shows another angle of the holistic view that was elaborated decades back. He begins with 18th-century Swiss mathematician, Euler and his \\"bridges\\" problem, stopping briefly on \\"graph theory\\" (a basis for thinking about today\\"s \\"networks\\"), moves on to Erdos (and Renyi) and their  random network theory based on \\"chance\\" and \\"randomness\\" showing static nature of networks. The link between \\"Six degrees of separation\\"  by Milgram (experimental psychologist) and its preceding probable origin in Karinthy\\"s (Hungerian writer) fictional story named \\"chains\\" (that first conveyed that at the most five acquaintances connect every person on earth) leads to his own findings: \\"19 degrees of separation\\" which estimated Internet to be a small sized world in a way that every document is on average 19 clicks away from any other. Moving from Granovetter\\"s idea that society is a fragmented web of fully connected \\"clusters\\" communicating through \\"weak ties\\", to \\"synchronization\\" and the quantity \\"clustering coefficient\\" by Watts and Strogatz, the author paves a way to his own concepts of \\"hubs and connectors\\".  The few \\"connectors\\" in society are those who know a large number of people like Internet architecture is dominated by a few very highly connected nodes or \\"hubs\\". Italian economist Pareto[\\"s] 80/20 (80% citations go to only 38% scientists) rule is related here followed by \\"POWER LAW\\" with good examples. An important property is connected to hubs - a consequence of power laws: \\"scale free networks\\".<br />Other properties about networks are pointed through two laws. The \\"growth\\" (i.e. networks grow (addition of new nodes), it is compared with Erdos and Renyi\\"s static and random networks) and the \\"preferential attachment\\" (rich get richer: each network starts from small nucleus and expands with addition to new nodes). An answer to: why hubs and power laws emerge in scale free model? And a foundation for theory of evolving networks. Attaching further advancement - \\"competition\\" and that each node has certain \\"fitness\\", author assigns \\"fitness\\" to each Internet node in a network that mimics its ability to compete for links by showing how an early bird is not necessarily a winner  (a tussle between \\"yahoo\\" to \\"google\\"). \\"Competition\\" shapes the network topology - it is matched with \\"Bose-Einstein condensation\\". Barabasi categorized the networks into two kinds based on topology of networks. The first, in which scale-free topology survives despite the competition for links (fit get rich behavior): coexistence (of hierarchy) of hubs. Examples encompass real networks. Second is star topology - not scale-free (winner takes all the links) with an example of Microsoft. Stress is on scale-free wins most of the networks.<br />Attention is paid to \\"robustness of networks\\" - as in internet, a significant fraction of nodes can be randomly removed from any scale-free network without its breaking apart. Author justifies it with September 11 attacks - why the hubs were targeted? and further explains how the highly infected hubs offer means of persistence and spread based on a large numbers of links connected to it. The examples range from AIDS, to attractive e-mails, to computer virus. Now Paul Baran\\"s networks (prototype of Internet) find their way with a bit of 1960s-ARPA history. Further, leading to the idea of global internet map, he labels as \\"success disaster\\" - a human design that lives a life of its own having underlying fractal structure. The chapter \\"awakening Internet\\" concludes with interconnected remarks on growing and evolving Internet at an unparalleled rate paving a possibility towards self-awareness [a parallel to Wolfram\\"s idea of world being a computer and concept of cellular automata elaborate in his new book \\"a new kind of science\\"]. But then where to fit the remotest pockets (say in third world) where social life is still technologically primitive?<br />In chapter \\"fragmented web\\", mapping Internet (size wise) is related with search robots capable of indexing and searching the web with reference to search engines. Two chapters \\"map of life\\" (genetics) and \\"network economy\\" (economics) are good applications but a reservation is made towards a similar hub on \\"ecological networks\\". It is enough convincing that Human Genome Project or Celera Genomics have brought in the \\"the map of life\\" but a cellular search engine is still absent. Author shows that ATP is a biggest hub in living system by participating in huge number of reactions. Attention on cancer and manic depression are other analogies here. The last chapter \\"the web without a spider\\" emphasizes \\"no global controller\\" and shows how a scale-free network is a web without a spider. Once again, author talking about September 11 events and networks to other self-organized instances concludes with the question - where do we go from here? His answer is \\"un-wrapping\\", \\"focusing on dynamics that take place along links and moving beyond the structure and topology towards understanding complexity\\".<br />The author\\"s aim to get you to think networks: how they emerge, look like and evolve is well received. A chapteror big section on already acknowledged networks in \\"ecological systems\\" and attention on meta-networks would have added value to this already enough thoughtful, captivating, easy to understand, well designed rather spun web of dynamic efforts and ideas that this book presents. A last touch: the rich \\"notes\\" would be better with a separate bibliography.

Not since Sade had I heard a female voice that I could truly appreciate for the quality, uniqueness, and sheer talent of vocal abilities.

B000069HKH|5.0|Unbelievable. This CD is as good, if not surpassing the greatness of &quot;Darkness On The Edge Of Town&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;Born In the USA&quot;, etc.  Simply, it is GREAT!! All the songs are special in their own way; some sad, some rocking, some just very special.<BR>I feel as if I've been allowed into Bruce's very own grieving process, (including all the emotions inherent), of Sept. 11th, in its entirity. What an honor and a blessing for us all.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Because The Beatles' studio album CDs now available are not remakes of the old U.S. Capitol vinyl records, but the British EMI ones, the following songs on this CD are not on the current mainstream ones:<br />From Me To You<BR>She Loves You<BR>I Want To Hold Your Hand<BR>Can't Buy Me Love<BR>I Feel Fine<BR>Day Tripper<BR>We Can Work It Out<BR>Paperback Writer<BR>Lady Madonna<BR>Hey Jude<BR>The Ballad of John and Yoko<br />All of these songs are on The Beatles 1962-1966 and The Beatles 1967-1970, but that is two CDs.  The Beatles 1 gives you the opportunity to get all of them on one CD.

There is also a GREAT recipe for brown sauce ( an English staple) great bread and cupcake recipes. Yumm! <BR>A book to buy for the great \\"Soft-Set Peach and Red Currant Jam\\".
B000002J09|5.0|If you can only have one Led Zeppelin album, this is the one. All four members of the group shine equally on this album. Every song on here is in a range from excellent to masterpiece. There are the pure rock 'n' roll tracks like Black Dog and the aptly titled Rock and Roll. And there are the mellow songs like the famous Stairway to Heaven, and Going to California. The rest of the tracks tend to fall somewhere inbetween. But every track shares at least one attribute: quality. There's no filler or throw-away on this album, just great music.
B000069HKH|5.0|I don't buy much new music.  And, I don't think I have run out to buy anything the day it was released since the \\"Let it Be\\" album in 1969!  Imagine, then, my surprise at finding myself in line to buy \\"The Rising\\" on July 30.<br />Certainly the pre-release hype didn't hurt.  Watching Bruce on the Today show, reading the Time article, previewing the lyrics on the Bruce Springsteen website; all of these factors brought me to the local music store.  But, ultimately, it was Bruce himself who led me there.  Bruce the musician; Bruce the poet; Bruce the 52 year old who speaks to my emotions.<br />The events of September 11 changed me forever.  What I saw that day and what I felt shook me to my emotional roots.  I am a writer but of 9/11, I cannot write.  Words don't seem to be able to scratch the surface.  So I watched and felt and cried.  I knew that eventually someone would write the words for me and I believe that Bruce has done it.<br />This CD must be considered on two levels - the music and the significance of the message.  Both elements must be balanced or the work will not stand on its own merit.  I was concerned when I first heard about \\"The Rising\\" that the subject matter might be too powerful to be presented within the context of rock and roll.  I pictured myself listening to the music and falling back into the emotional abyss in which I dwelled for so long after 9/11.  I worried about the effect on the loved ones of those lost who are finally beginning to put their lives back together after nearly a year.  But I went out and bought the CD anyway - kind of like that phenomenon of not wanting to look at an accident but being unable to turn away.<br />I needn't have worried.  Bruce has managed to package the music and the message in a near perfect balance.  He has intentionally mismatched the music in some cases turning lyrics that might tear your heart out into those made palpable by the uplifting and steady rock beat.  The music is thick and rich, layered and real - it's rock and roll just the way I like it!  In this time of synthetic music and groups that don't play instruments, it is great to hear real guitars, drums and keyboards!  I found myself dancing to the music and feeling a release that has been a long time coming.<br />Can the music stand the test of time?  Can it stand independently of the event?  Does it have to?  September 11 is the most significant event in my generations' lifetime and my generation is Bruce's generation.  It irritates me that some people don't seem to understand that and want to act as though they were not affected.  We were all affected in some way that day.  \\"The Rising\\" expresses the feelings of victims, loved ones and even perpetrators.  It runs the gamut.  Bruce even tosses in a lighter tune,  \\"Let's Be Friends\\" to address the issue of survivors needing to get on with their lives and even find solace in physical contact with another human being.  It's okay to get it on, he is saying, skin to skin.<br />The most profound vision that I personally experienced post 9-11 was that of all those souls rising to heaven from the dust and ashes of destruction.  3000 souls rising, I kept thinking.....there's a song there, I thought.  Bruce beat me to it!  And that's okay because he has given it voice and an audience that my tune would never have.  That vision has comforted me and hopefully people will listen to \\"The Rising\\" and understand.  There is no comparison between this CD and the quickly penned ditty \\"Freedom\\" that Paul McCartney produced or Alan Jackson's \\"Where were You?\\".  This CD is a piece of work not simply a collection of songs.  I hope that he will perform this on tour as a whole, not just a few of the songs.  The music runs the gamut of emotions and should be heard consecutively.  It is original yet at the same time familiar.<br />I watched Bruce perform on the \\"Today\\" show and recognized all the gray hair in the crowd.  People like me who grabbed onto Bruce in the late seventieslike a life raft that would sail us out of the murky seas of disco and heavy metal.  Bruce brought the music back to me then and he has brought it back to me now.  We are still rocking, into our fifties but still rocking.  This in and of itself makes me feel better.  Thanks Bruce.grabbed onto Bruce in the late seventies like a life raft that would sail us out of the murky seas of disco and heavy metal.

B0000296SI|5.0|Why do people consider this a bad album! Well, it's not much different than the original album, only no swearing! It's amazing that someone actually said that Travis drums like a 5th grader, he's one of the best in  the world, for crying out loud! He's so fast on the drums, it's amazing! Reckless Abandon is 248 on the metronome, and Wendy Clear is 236, my metronome doesn't even go that fast. I tried playing it on my keyboard, with just a simple beat, I couldn't even keep up! It's unbelievebly fast! In no way is Blink 182 sellouts. heck, I hardly ever heard All The Small Things on the radio, cause I hardly ever listened to the radio! What's the point anyway? Anyhow, I'm way off topic! All The Small Things is a great song! Here's the list. Check my review for the actual cd for my comments:<br /> Dumpweed: 9/10<BR> Don't Leave Me: 8.5/10<BR> Aliens Exist: 9.5/10 the best!<BR> Going Away To College: 10/10 the best song ever!!<BR> What's My Age Again?: 9/10 <BR> Dysentary Gary: 9/10<BR> Adam's Song: 9/10<BR> All The Small Things: 9/10 great finish<BR> The Party Song: 8.5/10<BR> Mutt: 9/10<BR> Wendy Clear: 9.5/10<BR> Anthem: 10/10<br /> This cd rules, and so does Travis! as well as Mark and Tom, plus their hilarious lyrics!! This rules!!
B00006FDCD|4.0|This book of Stephen Kings' is quite old now and I 'spose most folk will have heard of it, so much so that a review on it's contents seems meritless, only I can't stop myself. <BR>IT was the scariest book I had ever read and retains that accolade even after all this time. I felt for, I liked really, I empathised...sympathised, cheered on, laughed, cried and messed my pants for the characters in this story. <BR>Then one day 'they' made a film of it (Tommy Lee Wallace to be more precise) and I rushed to see what 'they' would do with my friends the characters. Would it be sanitised...how could they do the storm drain scene...questions questions...I was not disappointed...not even a little bit. Awesome scary story that I love followed by; ditto on celluloid...Well done indeed.
B00004ZD69|5.0|If there was a REAL soundtrack (not any of this corny tribute music) to 9/11, this CD would be it... be careful, it'll shock you if you listen to this music along with your images of 9/11... the funny thing is listening to Godspeed's song, \\"Dead Flag Blues,\\" (F#A# Infinity Symbol CD) a week before the terrorist attacks. Godspeed really almost predicts the events of 9/11 so perfectly it's horrifying!! This album is terrific, Lift Yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven is Godspeed's most achieved work - all albums are similar in amazement, but, listening to this almost puts me in the events of September 11th and it's scary. All out incredible Canadian band, GODSPEED YOU BLACK EMPEROR! Has made a mark in their musical history... purchase this album... yet, be careful.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is probably the best war film on tv or movie i have ever seen. 10 hours of this is simply not enough!!! I hope HBO releases more of this type of stuff.
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic includes not only ten outstanding songs, but also her best album, which is very hard-working in all the aspects. On the one hand, the electronic sound she always uses is louder and more exploited, and we can notice this by just hearing to tunes like Hunter, All Neon like, 5 years or Alarm call. On the other hand, she makes perfect use of her orchestra in Bachelorette and Joga, both quite good. However, I can't tell the same about the harp, but I love this own style of her. Bjrk career is summed up here. If you were disappointed because of the Debut album, you should listen to this one and Vespertine, another of high quality.
B00005JL3A|3.0|First off I would like to address the idea that \\"Resident Evil\\" is a \\"Pure Horror\\" and not an action game. Have you people been living in the past. The game is based solely on action. The horror aspect was stuck in to give the genre a twist. Every Resident evil game was built around the shoot'em up concept. additionally, if anyone saw the previews before they decided to spend money on the movie would easily have known that this was a no-brainer, action flick. If you expected anything else then you shouldn't be writing reviews for anything.<br /> Needless to say, the movie was not the greatest movie ever made. It wasn't even close. But I can say it was fun to watch. I would like to see where they take the story to in the next movie, \\"Resident Evil: Nemesis\\" in the works now.
B00006AL1G|4.0|SCRATCH premiered here in Vancouver last Thursday, and I got a chance to go and view it with some friends. It is a feature-length documentary film that explores the world of the hip-hop DJ. SCRATCH showcased excellent and hidden-from-mainstream talent, had a smattering of humourous quips (mostly by Jurassic 5's Cut Chemist), alot of amazing scratch footage, and overall the documentary was quite good. <br />SCRATCH gave an insight into the turntablist scene that we don't get to see much in these modern days - you see someone scratching in a Gap commercial or an ad for Fanta, but you never really learn much about it. SCRATCH is a good example of a proficient and poignant view into where scratch DJing started, where it's been over the last 5 years, and a bit of insight as to where different artists see it going in the future. <BR>The documentary was quite lighthearted - started chronologically with the advent of the first scratch - something GrandWizard Theodore came up while whiffing the record back and forth during one of his mother's lectures. From there it took you on a journey of interviews and quips from DJs discussing the full gambit of flora and fauna relating to the world of turntablism - where their inspiration comes from, attempts at annotating the art, different styles from beat juggling to faderless scratching, how and why the DJ got started, what the role of a DJ is in music today, and whether or not the turntable is actually considered an instrument. Fascinating for a newcomer to the genre of scratching and turntablism, and at the same time invigorating and refreshing for the veteran - scratch DJs worldwide will become inspired by this documentary to elevate and innovate their styles and game. <br />It was great to see some DJs from around the world, but I think that it was focused a little too much on the american male DJ cross section. Although I understand in a documentary you can only have so many objects of information, but there could have been a greater global influence with interviews from some of the worldwide players like Dexta from Australia, DJ Shine from Denmark, A-Trak or Jr Flo from Canada, Woody, Plus One from the UK, the list goes on. The other thing that was lacking was the focus of females in the scratching scene - although DJ Faust's girlfriend Shortee was featured, there are some extremely talented female DJs out and about that put a lot of the guys in the scene to shame. <br />There were a couple of other things that were obviously lacking in this documentary, namely DJ Jazzy Jeff, who invented the transform and chirp scratch, and DJ D-Styles who ranks above most of the people in this documentary. I would have also liked to see some examples of where scratching is going, and where the new branches are taking the art form, but then again you only have 90 minutes. It's too bad that they had to put in 'filler' with interviewing Q-Bert's marketing manager Yoga Frog, who simply praised Q the whole time, and Tony Prince, the hardly sober man allegedly behind the DMC Championships. <br />In conclusion, SCRATCH was a relatively well informed look into turntablism - the artform and the culture. Although it could have been better, I was impressed with the DJs that they did use, the message they conveyed, and most importantly the footage that they showcased. This is a \\"must see\\" for those of you who don't know much about scratching or turntablism, and a \\"maybe see\\" for those of you that do.
B00000AFGM|5.0|THIS IS THE GREATEST MANSON ALBUM EVER!!! If you do not own it (can't imagine why you wouldn't), then this is a must have. Don't pay any attention to the other reviews that state it's not as good as \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" true that is a terrific album, but it's nothing compared to this.The songs on \\"Mechanical Animals\\" are very much set apart from one another, which is always nice.The lyrics really grab ahold of you, I remember when I first bought this album and I was listening to each song, I would have certain lyrics stuck in my head and be like, \\"okay, now which song was that?\\" Because they hit me so hard, I needed to hear them again and again. I recommend not playing this outloud 4 a while until u know the lyrics (if you're younger and your parents are protective but let you buy the album, kinda like me) because it does touch on subjects such as: drugs, suicide, a little sex, and drugs again. I'd say my fave 3 songs from this album would be: \\"The Dope Show\\" \\"Speed Of Pain\\" and \\"I Don't Like The Drugs (but the drugs like me\\"). So, in conclusion THIS ALBUM ROCKS I listen to it almost everyday, if you are looking to buy your first Manson album, this one's the one to buy!!!...
B00000JMQE|5.0|I saw this film at its premiere in Seattle (The Emerald City) in 1985.  I had read the Oz books for years (including the then-elusive non-Baum books written after his death) and always loved the mix of danger, whismy, and enchantment in the books.<br />I grew up (like every other person in America)with memories of the 1939 musical--but even as a kid I hated the fact that the MGM musical messed so much with the dangerous and frightening aspects of Oz, turning everything into a candy-coated Technicolor dream.<br />Thus, when I finally saw RETURN TO OZ (based on two books, OZMA of OZ and THE LAND of OZ), I realized that the filmmakers had actually sat down and read the books.  Gone were the happy go-lucky images of a very safe place (was Judy Garland's Dorothy ever truly in danger?!?) and in its place was a fairyland full of dark dreams, scary villains, and entirely unique characters.  And yet, most of America kept asking, \\"Where's the Munchkins?\\"<br />In fact, the film critic for our local paper so trashed the film on its release that I (as a lowly high school sophomore) wrote him a detailed letter explaining what he had missed in the film by spending all his time comparing it to the MGM film.  He (like most of America) missed some wonderful moments:  Fairuza Balk's film debut as a real, brave, and sometimes scared little girl being called on to save an entire country from extinction, the Oscar-nominated special effects that brought to life characters that had only existed on paper (like Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Nomes), and the great performances by British actors Nicol Williamson and Jean March as the villains.<br />Walter Murch and his team got everything right with this one, even down to character design: look at how closely the Oz chracters (Tik-Tok, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman, etc.) match the way they looked in John R. Neil's illustrations; listen to the amazing score composed by David Shire, full of life, brilliance, and haunting motifs (the opening credit sequence alone gives chills); and the use of Will Vinton's Claymation (of California Raisins fame) to bring the rock-based Nomes to life.<br />Unfairly dumped by Disney in the ensuing years (to the point that this DVD version isn't even released by them), the film is only now being rediscovered by people who love great fantasy, great filmmaking, and who truly love to see OZ on screen.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000002B2X|5.0|Sap is the last of the Alice in Chains collection I got. Though sap is short, it is defintely an EP worth listening to. It goes well with the early alice in chains sound of dirt and facelift. Chris Cornell guest vocals on right turn add a lot. Something good for all alice in chains albums.
B000066F6H|4.0|Despite the good press, the Hives are good, very good. They have a secret weapon, that squeaky-toy lodged deep in Howlin' Pelle Almqvist's throat. They 're also more varied then most garage; similar  but better than Flamin' Sideburns.<BR>Favorite: Main Offender There's a surreal quality to these songs that's sets them apart from average garagerock.<BR>Highlights:<BR>The Hives (Declare Guerre Nucleaire), Die, All Right!, A Get Together to Tear It Apart, Outsmarted - who doesn't get disgusted?, The Hives-Introduce the Metric System in Time . Find Another Girl - the ballad, Statecontrol, Inspection Wise 1999, Supply And Demand - simply rocking<BR>I burned out on this CD pretty quickly - so enjoy the high while it lasts. Do not get \\"Barely Legal\\"; it's very mediocre.
0743455967|4.0|This book is as close to chatting with Stephen King as most of us will ever get. It's part biography--and a fascinating one at that-- King's childhood was NOT one you'd want for yourself and looking back on it, it's no wonder that he writes horror today. It's an honest look at his joys, and sorrows and his former addictions. The second half of the book is purely about writing and it sometimes goes wildly against the advice you may have gotten from your Fiction 101 college course. King talks about inspiration, magic, genius and tells the brutal truth about bad writers. He charms, infuriates and challenges. I have read this book several times and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be a writer. My only quible is the quality of this paperback. It's fine if you are only going to read the book once or twice but if you intend to use it as a manual you'd be better off buying the hardback or the more expensive but sturdier quality paperback edition. <br />Kimberley Lindsay Wilson
B00004XQ83|5.0|The lyrical nature of the music lends a certain quality to &quot;O Brother Whereart Thou&quot; that is not very often seen in movies these days. This soundtrack captures so many moments during the film so brilliantly that its almost easy to overlook the strength of the songs on their own merit.<br />This CD is very diverse not only stylistically but also historically. Some songs are Original recordings dating as far back as 70 years ago. While others are reconstructions of old time favorites. This CD is Country music as its essence. Not the poppy Garth Brooks that is synomonous with Country music today but rather the ROOTS of so many derivations of styles, including the Blues which gave way to Jazz and Rock n Roll. The Soundtrack moves brilliantly from an old song sung by REAL prison inmates breaking rocks on the chain-gang recorded in the 50s to a cleaner poppy version of an old time song &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot;<br />There are so many great Gems in this CD thats its almost surprising. Listening to this in my car, I never realized that half these songs were even in the film, but sure enough when you hear it you know exactly where in the movie it lies. I think that speaks strongly both of the Cohen brothers specific choices for the songs but also the poignant story-telling elements in the songs themselves.<br />Pick this one up if you're looking for something DIFFERENT, you will be Pleasantly surprised.
B000069HKH|5.0|It's not the big rock album that many people anticipated, but THE RISING is not without some huge anthemic songs.  The range of styles and tempos is clearly an attempt to appeal to a wider audience, and, gasp, to be &quot;modern.&quot; All of this may bother some fans of previous E Street music.  <br />What is most apparent about this effort is how much Springsteen is attuned to the AAA (adult alternative audio) listeners.  This small but growing audience is sustained mostly by a network of PR stations that cater to its eclectic tastes.  Songs like &quot;Worlds Apart,&quot; &quot;The Fuse,&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot; are clearly nods to this group.  <br />Overall, THE RISING is a really fine album.  It contains sixty minutes of passionate, intelligent, timely music and thirteen or so that should have stayed in the editing room.  That's not a bad batting average in today's market.  <br />It's been a long time since any pop artist has produced a recording as coherent or important as THE RISING.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Anyone who's seen Nicole Kidman in a movie will say two things about her: She's beautiful and fairly talented. Anyone who's seen Nicole Kidman in two or more movies will say two things about her: She's beautiful and very talented. Because Kidman never plays the same character twice, each one is distinct as she proves yet again in this movie. In Moulin Rouge Kidman puts on a raunchy and sometimes delightfully ridiculous performance as Satine, a dancer in France's Moulin Rouge. <BR>         The story revolves around a young, artistic and (if you're asking me) incredibly handsome writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor), who is hired to write the script for the play that will turn the infamous whorehouse into a theatre.  Well, he - being obsessed with Bohemian ideals truth, beauty, freedom and love - falls madly in love with Satine, the featured showgirl. <BR>         But Satine, doing what she does for a living, is paid to make any man believe she is in love with him, but must genuinely fall in love with no one. Yet, after some persuading she does fall for the adorable writer and they commence to have a secret relationship. Which, must be kept even more secret after a rich duke who is paying for the expenses of the play says he won't give them the money they are relying on if Satine is not legally bound to him. However, it soon becomes clear that both men can lust as they might but Satine's fate will take a different turn, one that doesn't involve either of them. <BR>         The story, which starts off light, silly and very fictional soon becomes romantic, enthralling and ultimately tragic. The setting is perfect, representing freedom and opportunity for some characters but entrapment and desperation for others. Not only are the characters terrifically well done but the cast is magical. Along side Kidman and McGregor, John Leguizamo and Jim Broadbent star as the lisping Toulouse and owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler. <BR>And let's not forget the music! Although not original, favorites like Material Girl and Your Song are given magnificent new sounds in this new-age musical. Not to mention both of the stars can sing pretty well. <BR>         In my opinion this is simply one of the best movies of 2001, but I'm sadly aware that it is rather strange and hard for those with more traditional taste to enjoy. But I still feel that anyone who doesn't give Moulin Rouge a chance is missing out on a whimsical, diverse, yet heartbreaking and romantic movie experience.

0316666343|1.0|I saw Anna Quindlen on the Today show promoting this book as a \\"future classic\\" and the best book she had read in years.  She either must be a friend of Alice Seibold's or is receiving some kind of kickback from the publisher.  I could not wait for this book to  come out and submitted to the hype.  Having recently suffered an expected death in my family, I was prepared for a life changing book with some profound meaning and depth. What I got instead was over hyped, amateurish, cliche, overhyped drivel.

B0000013G9|5.0|On their 92 debut, \\"Ooooh...on the TLC tip,\\" they showed their playful side. Who could take anyone wearing a condom on one eye and baggy pants seriously anyway? Then they returned with \\"CrazySexyCool,\\" and the smash, \\"Creep,\\" an ode to \\"creeping\\" or fooling around on the unsuspecting girlfriend/boyfriend.  The video shows the TLC \\"girls\\" looking and acting more sensual and sexy.  Wearing (baggy) silk pajamas and sashaying around, these women are anything but silly.  Then came, \\"Waterfalls.\\" {A tune I did not care for.)  Then came \\"Red Light Special\\", another slow tune about, well, you can listen and get an idea.  I also liked the tune, \\"Diggin On You\\", which video showcased live footage from when the TLCc women were on tour.  This album was THE album that made everyone take these three talented women seriously.

B000000WCV|4.0|After hearing &quot;Discovery,&quot; the second full-length from Daft Punk, and &quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Around the World,&quot; I thought that &quot;Homework&quot; would be a big beat album with disco house influence.  After I bought it, it sounded like a old school hip hop album (that is still undeniably good).  I could just imagine the breakers pop-locking to &quot;Revolution 909&quot; and breaking to &quot;Phoenix.&quot;  Daft Punk followers already have this album, why don't you?
B00005JKYI|3.0|I was embarrassed in re-watching this movie how dated it was.  The dancing is cheesy, really bad hair, bad music, and great actors like John Lithgow and Diane Wiest stuck in bad roles.  Skip this one and watch \\"Streets of Fire.\\"
0375751513|4.0|Oscar Wilde's \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an entertaining, short novel, with a very honest moral to it.  A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with.  Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead.  In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic.  As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.<br />Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic.  This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies.  Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\"  For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra.
B00004XQ83|5.0|...what more is there to say?<br />Well, let me just thank them for bringing bluegrass back into fashion.  I enjoy country music but have always preferred bluegrass and to be able to turn on the radio and here some now is very pleasant.

B000002UB3|2.0|You all must be hearing a different version of this album.  Because the one i have heard stinks.  Songs such as \\"Mean Mr Mustard\\" and \\"Because\\" are some of the most cringe-worthy songs of the entire decade.  I'm serious.  Not only is this album not 'great', or 'important', it's actually bad.  It's a chore for me to sit through this one.<br />If it weren't a beatles album, it would, justifiably, be out-of-print and forgotten by now.<br />It's ok to say what you _really_ think about this album, and these songs...<br />This album is perhaps even more over-rated than Sgt Pepper.  And, again, it's okay to say what you really think about that album, too.  I wonder how you can look yourself in the mirror after saying that \\"Getting Better\\" is some of the most important music of the entire century.<br />The Beatles that everyone loved was the Beatles of \\"I want to hold your hand\\" and \\"She loves you\\", not the Beatles of \\"Mean Mr Mustard\\".   Right?
B000002UAR|4.0|Coming from a previous Beatles hater, 4 stars is quite a compliment. As a 15 year old music fan, I'm INCREDIBLY selective when it comes to what I listen to. Being the hardcore Bee Gees fan that I am, I never even thought of giving the Beatles a second thought. Then, one day, i was struck with an urge to listen to music, and the only person in the office was a Beatles fan. His suggestion? He handed over &quot;Revolver&quot;. I made myself listen to it, and to tell you the truth, I was very impressed. This is the only Beatles album I've listened to that I think justifies their popularity. Having listened to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (get the soundtrack to the 1978 movie, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. It's much better), &quot;Abbey Road&quot; and Paul McCartney's &quot;Driving Rain&quot;, I had no idea as to why the Beatles were so praised, and why everyone thought that they were the &quot;Gods of Songwriting&quot;. I must say that I love &quot;Revolver&quot;, though, and I'm very glad to have it in my collection...
6305878323|5.0|...and if you know the punchline to that one, then you've already seen \\"Mary Poppins\\", the best live-action movie ever produced by Walt Disney Productions in the master's lifetime. London is brought to the screen beautifully, gray and coal-based but not without parks and trees--but how wonderful everything becomes when we pop off into a sidewalk chalk drawing! Then the English countryside explodes with color and talking/singing livestock, even though penguins aren't quite native to the British Isles.<br />The chalk drawing is courtesy of Bert the erstwhile chimney sweep and it's he also who introduces us to Cherry Lane and its unhappy inhabitants, the Banks family. Unhappy because the two children Michael and Jane are being neglected while the parents pursue a banking job and the suffragette movement. What's needed is a good nanny to take things in hand, and right on cue, down lands Mary Poppins on the doorstep. Michael and Jane are convinced she has magical powers and even magical friends, but Father is convinced otherwise, although he can never best her in conversation. How the Banks family get in touch with each other and the power of familial love is the crux of the matter, and it couldn't happen without the intervention of Mary Poppins.<br />Julie Andrews is a stand-out in her debut role, and never looked lovelier than here in her dark wig with a proper amount of hair--not that close cropped signature hairstyle she's had since \\"The Sound of Music\\" that does nothing for her. She's a prim know it all with a lovely soprano voice, who slyly indulges in magic from time to time. Dick Van Dyke has a double role as Bert, her roguish beau and as old Mr. Dawes, the greedy head of the bank where Mr. Banks works. David Tomlinson is great as the civil servant dad, the sort of fellow cariacatured by John Cleese so well. Glynnis Johns has less to do as Mother, but still good. And other supporting roles amply filled by Reta Shaw, Hermione Baddeley, Arthur Treacher, Ed Wynn, Elsa Lanchester, and Jane Darwell (in a nonspeaking role as the Bird Woman of St. Paul's, her last role). And not to forget those wonderful child actors playing Michael and Jane! Not a moppet between them.<br />\\"Mary Poppins\\" is a delight from start to finish. Set yourself about finding it and pop it in the VCR asap.

B00004YRQA|5.0|Sony's 8MB memory card for the PS2 is a great buy. The price is pretty reasonable and the performance is great. Its transfer rate is amazingly fast. And last but not least, the design. Its compact, durable and almost weightless!!
B000068TP0|5.0|This is by far the best music video ever produced. Shakira is an extremely talanted young artist who breaths new life into the Latin music scene. This video inspires the mind too be as creative and outgoing as the artist. Shakira also demonstrates exquisit dance styles that will keep your eyes glued to the television set. The bonus footage provideds even more insight into this artists work. Subtitles also help to make the experience enjoyable for all.
0316666343|5.0|I admit that the beginning chapters were most disturbing and spooked me. I classify myself as \\"cozy mystery reader\\" so the bloody details in this book haunted me more than I liked. It was like watching a scary movie, I had to watch something funny before going to bed. LOL<br />However, the story drew me in and it was INCREDIBLE writing! It will make you ponder your thoughts of Heaven and really gets you thinking which a good book should do!<br />I highly recommend this book!!!
B00003CXAT|5.0|The film which is based on one of Michael Crichton's great books. The movie shares the same concept and characters but more scenes were added to the film and some scenes deleted. But the film's plot smoothes as easy as [poop] through a goose. Alan Grant is played by the great Sam Neill, Ellie Sattler is played Laura Dern, Richard Attenburg plays the owner of Jurassic Park, and Ian Malcolm is played by Jeff Goldblum. An original storyline got many butts into the seats of the theater which got Speilberg's film to be his highest grossing film to date(not counting the re-release of E.T.'s money in theaters). Critically acclaimed by critics and people who have seen this great film. This film is a work of Speilburgian genius in his earlier films such as E.T. and Gremlins. The next sequel was horribly bad and the next one was A-OK and the forth in the series has been green-lighted by Universal Studios which means more menacing dinosaurs on the loose.
B000005ALP|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums I own. I would recommend it to anyone. In a world where most music is made for the radio, finally a band steps up to the plate with deep, meaningful lyrics and dazzling songs to back them up.
6300213714|5.0|Rarely is there a movie like The Warriors. Why some people may call the story sloppy, its rather well though out when you dive into the gangs that still infest many cities today. A gang trying to make it to their turf while trekking through rival gangs areas. The Warriors moves at a lightning fast pace with tough as nails action scenes and a great chase scene through a park as well. Even with its age, The Warriors still runs with the best action movies to date by not doing something that so many others can't help but doing half way through, and thats &quot;slowing down&quot;.
B000002TQV|5.0|Whether you are already into Radiohead and for some reason haven't got round to checking out this album yet, or are just getting into the band, I highly recommend their second album, The Bends. Radiohead are famous (or infamous) for their intellegent and often cryptic lyrics, the clear/whiny/high/low  (gorgeous) falsetto voice of frontman Thom Yorke and the musical atmosphere the band create as a whole. Whether regarded as critics darlings' for the pure quality of the stuff these guys come out with, or rejected for being avant garde or depressing due to the band's ever suprising explorations into different genres of music (i.e. Kid A, Amnesiac and their recently premiered new material), The Bends is part of Radiohead's musical progression and excelent to listen to.<br />I do not believe their is a weak track on the album, though personally, some I come back to more than others. Here's a quick run through;<br />1)PLANET TELEX: Nice opener - futuristic, spacey feel, not astounding in my view but still good to listen to.<br />2)THE BENDS: Ballsy, rocky track, the lyrics themselves showing the bands often dry sense of humour, \\"they brought in the CIA, the banksand the whole marine to blow me away\\".<br />3)HIGH AND DRY: A pretty track, it was one of the albums singles, when you here it, you'll recognise it. Very acoustic, High and Dry is inoffensive and suprisingly catchy.<br />4)FAKE PLASTIC TREES: Acoustic and orchestral, slow tempo, sad lyrics, sad vocals but totally beautiful. One of my favourites.<br />5)BONES: Background music or a good sing-a-long, nothing soul wrenching. Nice grinding guitars.<br />6)(NICE DREAM): Serene start, full of ideals, a nice dream, includes some heavier guitars. Somehow sad. But good.<br />7)JUST: Many people who aren't bothered with Radiohead quite like this track, it's angst ridden and guitar leaden (loadsa chords), comes on strong, leaves you wanting to play it again.<br />8)MY IRON LUNG: Seems gentle enough but is littered with heavier guitar episodes. Some lyrics reflecting the music business \\"this is our new song just like the last one, a total waste of time\\", others totally wierd!<br />9)BULLET PROOF...I WISH I WAS: Slow, quiet and sad (about insecurities and paranoia) but not bad at all. Simple guitar, haunting background noises like sirens. <br />10)BLACK STAR: Absolutely brilliant. Morose and personal, excelent guitar riffs and chorus, excelent vocals and lyrics.<br />11)SULK: Like Bones or Just, roaring chorus, good background tune.<br />12)STREET SPIRIT (FADE OUT): Mesmerising. Gorgeous guitar arpegioes. This track's so simple but it engulfs you. The lyrics match the otherworldly sense of the song, making you feel just a small human in a big, darkening world.<br />There you go. This is a CD worth lisitening to even if you have no affiliation towards the band at all...you never know, it might grow on you! Said to be the most commercial album of the 5 existing LP's many of the tracks appeal to a wide audience because of their quality, I can't stress the brilliance enough.
0887307280|4.0|Like a lot of people, I've often thought about starting my own business.  But, it's a big step and the thought of failure--time, money, emotional investment--has always haunted me.  So, I was really comforted by this book because it answers a lot of my concerns.  I'm a lot more confident about my ideas now, but I found Guerilla PR: Wired answering my concerns about getting my name out on the Internet better than E-Myth.
B000066NW0|2.0|If your looking for punk rock when you buy Avril's cd. You'll be sorry that you bought the cd. The songs are mostly pop.  The music is like Alanis Morrisette. But avril's lyrics aren't as deep. Some songs are really lame.
B000067JHW|5.0|Amelie is unlike anything I have ever seen, and after seeing this directors work in City of the Lost Children, thats a big statement. Amelie is about a young girl (Audrey Tautou) who's key to life is by making others see the beauty that they never can see themselves, here eventful encounters with many unique characters bring her to a romance with a mysterious man who's hobby is collection torn pictures throw in the trash next to photo booths. The movie is so utterly adorable it makes viewers blush with how cute and charming it is, and it doesn't hurt that Audrey Tautou is the cutest actress today complete with her little grin. I was smiling the entire way through, Amelie is a beautiful film please don't miss it!
B000068OSK|5.0|Here is the first effort of the next age in rock,  Jack and Meg White (not brother and sister either - they used to be married) push off hard with this effort.  You really need to see the progression of greatness in this band, so start here and then go on to De Stijl and Cells and know you are onto something incredible here.<br />One reviewer said &quot;White Stripes' is completely unselfconscious-- it's just two kids honestly following their instincts and influences, yet creating an original.&quot;  He's right, The Stripes don't sound like anybody else (no matter how hard you try to draw parallels).  Legions of other bands will be compared to them, not the other way around.<br />In Jimmy you honestly think Jack's guitar is going to explode......there just isn't any room for bass and rhythm in this sound.....how can one guy sound like System Of A Down, Metallica, or Rush all by himself?  Big Three, Cannon, Bricks, Screwdriver.....honestly, there is way too much sound here for two people.....it's the sound of an original rock lightning strike......it's rare......there hasn't been a band like this one in 10 years.
B000058T5J|4.0|The previous reviewer is wrong when he says the muscians on this albumn are not jazz musicians.  Keith Jarrett, Jack DeJohnette, John Mclaughlin and Gary Bartz were (and still are) some of the most techincally accomplished musicians around.  Only Michael Henderson, who plays bass on this albumn, had no previous jazz experience.  All of the above are playing at a career best on this album.  <BR>I'd say this albumn is better and more focused than Bithces Brew and includes some of the best fusion music Miles ever played.  'What I say' is a highlight for me; surely this must be one of the most angriest, intense tracks ever recorded.  Finally, Miles' playing is on top form and he plays with amazing confidence and speed.  If you've listened to a couple of Miles Davis's electric albumns and you like what you hear; then get this.
6304698542|4.0|This classic is the best depiction to date of the deadance of pre-Nazi Berlin. It quite accurately shows the mindset of many Berliners and Germans in the days before Nazism; money was almost worthless and inflation spirling out of control so instead of saving your money which could be worthless at any moment go out and enjoy life while you could. In addition to being a wonderful movie, any student of German history should view this film to get an idea of the conditions during Hitler's rise to power.
B000069HKH|5.0|The cd gets better with each listen. The E Street Band has never sounded better. One of the most passionate albums in their long career. Worth the wait.  The cd was meant to be listened to in its entirety. To get the best out of it, I recommend listening to it when you have an hour to spare, put it on the cd player and get swept away. There is no better companion than Bruce. <BR>He will take you to another level.<BR>While only time will tell if this has the lasting power of Born To Run (27 years), it is a work reflecting the times with hope and gentleness.
B000025RAU|5.0|In \\"Chinatown\\", Jack Nicholson plays a hard-boiled, yet decent private eye, Jake Gittes, who is drawn into a labyrinth of corruption and evil involving the misappropriation of water during a drought in 1930's Los Angeles County.<br />Faye Dunaway plays the beautiful and enigmatic Evelyn Mulwray whose husband uncovers the misdeeds. He is murdered as a result.<br />\\"Chinatown\\" is a tour de force in every aspect from the slyly engrossing direction of Roman Polanski to the brisk and ingenious screenplay by Robert Towne.<br />The performances are uniformly superb.  Nicholson is 100% believable as the sardonic, weary, and compassionate detective.  And Faye Dunaway proves yet again that she is more than simply a classic beauty.  (And her beauty is quite extraordinary indeed!)<br />Dunaway subtly conveys the intelligence, anguish, and tragedy of her femme fatale character.  Hers is a heartbreaking, richly layered performance.<br />From the onset, Dunaway is able to suggest that Evelyn Mulwray's icy composure is merely a defense mechanism which hides unspeakable trauma.  You come to realize just how vulnerable and fragile her seemingly impenetrable persona is.<br />\\"Chinatown\\" is an intellectual, gut-wrenching masterpiece. It represents the work of artists at the peak of their skills.  \\"Chinatown\\" has and will endure as one of the finest movies ever made.
B00000JZC4|5.0|1999's Title of Record finds Filter expanding its sound, adding in hints of psychedelia, electronica and other effects, with the end result clearly yielding better, deeper songs. Songs such as \\"Welcome to the Fold\\", \\"It's Gonna Kill Me\\" and \\"I Will Lead You\\" carry much of the same riff-intensive bluster like much of what was found on their debut entitled Short Bus, but this time with greater attention to melody and catchy choruses. Filter also branches out to new territory with songs like \\"Captain Bligh\\", \\"I'm Not the Only One\\", \\"The Best Things\\", \\"Cancer\\" and the catchy hit single, \\"Take a Picture\\". \\"Take a Picture\\" features some acoustic guitar, and \\"The Best Things\\" finds the band combining the techno sounds of the Chemical Brothers and STP-inflected arena rock, thus concocting a fast paced, bass-heavy, room-shaking rock song. <br />As a whole, the songs (though quite varied from the hard-driving rock of \\"Welcome to the Fold\\" to the Radiohead-esque crooning of \\"I'm Not the Only One\\") flow together quite well. Certainly, the newfound depth and songwriting exhibited here is quite a pleasant surprise. Title Of Record may be unworthy to be placed alongside records such as \\"Play\\" by Moby or \\"Battle of Los Angeles\\" by RATM(arguably the two best albums of that year) in terms of 1999 masterpieces. But without regard to such superlatives, it still remains as one emotion-filled, diverse piece of music worth hearing - - Highly recommended.
0385720920|4.0|I wish I could have truly given this book 4.5 stars, but that is not an option.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 is the fact that when reading book by Chuck Palahniuk, you know to expect the unexpected, so the surprises are not as surprising.<br />That being said, this is one of the deepest novels that Palahnuik has written.  In his first three novels, Palahnuik writes about the wickedness of society and ways to obscure and change it, but in this book he looks at someone who is looking for a place in society and their desire to be needed.<br />This is not a first in Palahniuk's work, but here it is most prevelant.  The main character, Vincent Mancini, does everything he can to be wanted and needed, but tries to put off the persona that he could care less.  Vincent goes as far as doing things that he knows is wrong, but in the back of his mind he knows he is good person that wants to be liked and needed.  He goes as far as taking blame for all possible wrongs and believing things that are improbable, all in the name of being needed.<br />Two-thirds the way through the book, you may begin to have problems believing what is being told and the way things seem to be turning out, but stay true to the book and you will be rewarded.<br />The ending may not be for everyone, but it suits the story and Pakahniuk's writing style well.  From reading all of his books, you can definitely see a writer who is growing in his craft.<br />At just under 300 pages, this is a good read and well worth the time.
0316666343|1.0|I sure was duped. After hearing a glowing review on National Public Radio, I bought this book for my wife.  My wife and I agree that this book comes no where close to the reviews. If anything, the book is an example of how the marketing machine can make pretty much anything into a &quot;masterpiece&quot; for a time. The book reads like Judy Blume. So if you like Judy Blume, go for it.
B0000640SA|5.0|This review will only deal with the features found on the &quot;Memento Limited Edition 2 Disc Set&quot;, and not the merits of the movie proper.<br />-------<br />My only qualm with this DVD edition is the packaging.  Wrapped in a tight-fitting but flimsy cardboard box, designed to look like Leonard Shelby's case file, it's almost impossible to get the discs out on first try.  I find that I have to open the back to push out the innards, which tends to warp the shape of the box.  Found inside are several loose sheets of paper, which look like psychological tests, notes from the case history, and, as you will soon see, the DVD's on-screen menus.  The whole thing is ostensibly held together by a little plastic paper clip, whose only real purpose, I've deduced, is to get lost behind my TV set.<br />The first thing one notices once Disc 1 of the DVD loads is a psychological test, asking the viewer to commit to memory a list of words that will go flashing by on the screen.  Don't be alarmed.  Although Chris Nolan and Co. have set up the DVD to look like a series of tests, you really don't have to read through or pay much attention to everything on the screen.  However, because sometimes they can be quite entertaining, I suggest you do.  &quot;Why are these people laughing at you?&quot; asks one question.  &quot;We know you did it,&quot; ominously states another.  This edition can get trippy if you let it.<br />After the memory flash, you are then asked to select from a list of words the ones you didn't see.  Like I said, this isn't really a test, but an ingenious way to present the disc's main menu.<br />Selecting WATCH plays the movie.  Selecting READ allows you to choose between English or Spanish subtitles, while LISTEN allows you to hear the movie in either English or French, 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1 Surround Sound.  CHAPTER sends you right to the scene selection option.  And COMMENTS turns on Christopher Nolan's Director's Commentary track.<br />In my review ofthe commentary track for &quot;Following&quot;, Nolan's first movie, I called his delivery &quot;monotone... somnolent at times&quot; but that he's &quot;so smart and precise about what he's saying you can easily overlook that and become engrossed in the content.&quot;  I can say pretty much the same thing here.  Except that, in some ways, it's a less effective track.  Nolan spends a lot of time analyzing the story, deconstructing the main character, his motivations, the structure, etc.  They are the kind of out-loud thoughts a screenwriter might use when figuring out his screenplay, but serve little purpose for a viewer watching the film (okay, I suppose prospective screenwriters will get some value out of it).  It is thrilling to see how Nolan's big brain works, how he's thought through every situation, and has a reason for including everything in the movie.  But it's just one note played over and over for an hour and a half.  If Nolan had mixed things up a bit, included more anecdotal information, or behind the scenes goodies, it would have been a stellar track.  As it is, it's got a very narrow appeal.<BR> <BR>Disc 2 begins much the same way that Disc 1 did, except this time you are asked to view a series of pictures, and then are asked to select which picture from a list wasn't shown.  This is, as I'm sure you have guessed, the menu for the additional material features.<br />Selecting the COMPASS shows you a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, as well as pages from Leonard's Journal.  The BOOK allows you to read Nolan's script while listening to the audio track of the movie.  You are even privy to the notes he made in the margins of the script, offering further thoughts on how scenes might be filmed.  The GLOBE brings forth a whole mess of international promotional material, while the BINOCULARS give the option of viewing the international and North American theatrical trailers.<br />Selecting the SKULL starts a featurette, produced by the Sundance Channel, called&quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot;.  Nolan, his editor, composer, producer, cinematographer, and one actor (Joey Pantoliano) discuss the whys and hows of the production.  Particular emphasis is given to the opening few scenes, detailing how they were set up to gently bring the audience into the aesthetic of the film.  Overall, the 25-minute segment further cements the notion that Nolan is an intelligent filmmaker, in full control of his cinematic palette.<br />Although not listed in the features on the DVD box, the much-ballyhooed 'Chronological Version' -- playing the scenes in the order in which they happen rather than back to front -- is here.  Trust me.  I just watched it.  I'm not going to tell you how to find this version, for I think that would be a spoiler on par with giving away the end (beginning?) of the movie.  But I will say that this information is available in several places online, so those of you who get frustrated with the puzzle should easily be able to obtain the answers (if not, drop me an e-mail).  And I must say, &quot;Memento&quot; is still quite a gripping tale when told this way.  But it does make Nolan's reason for telling the story his &quot;gimmicky&quot; way quite clear.  The problem with this feature, however, is that it doesn't offer you the option of fast forwarding or jumping from scene to scene.  So unless you can watch the whole movie in one sitting, you better not press 'stop'.<br />If you enjoyed &quot;Memento&quot; because it was a complex puzzle of a film, than I suspect you will enjoy this equally complex and even more puzzling DVD version.  I'm almost positive that there is more to this edition than the features I've listed above.  And I look forward to hunting for them in the future... or is that the past?
B00004TL21|5.0|There is a hard rock band raising the standard and their name is the Deftones, whose latest offering \\"White Pony\\" comes closer to a hard rock version of Dark Side of the Moon or OK Computer, than say, an aimless, angstful rant  -- this is to say its an effort worth noting. <br />The Deftones, fronted by vocalist Chino Moreno, are known for having a loud, abrasive, bass-heavy sound similar to Korn, and certainly there are moments on the recording such as on the songs \\"Elite\\", \\"Feticceria\\", \\"Street Carp\\" and \\"Korea\\" in which the Deftones reach a Korn-esque level of intensity and ferocity. However, the real gems are found when the Deftones steer clear of relentlessly dark, heavy riffs and evil growls in favor of some more varied progressions and vocal stylings. Songs such as \\"RX Queen\\", \\"Digital Bath\\", \\"Teenager\\", \\"Pink Maggit\\" and hit single \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" are all fine examples of this. A distinct difference is found too in the lyrics, which highlight far more feeling and true emotion than most other bands within their genre. And, they do it with surprising tunefulness, melody and grace (especially for a hard rock band). <br />In a way, the album is a hard-rock version of Dark Side of the Moon or OK Computer that is bolstered by Moreno's impressive vocal range. Moreno's deep vocal range compliments the music quite well, as it flows so seamlessly despite taking many different stylistic and auditorily frightening, unexpected twists and turns (the two spookiest being the high-pitched falsetto scream heard on \\"Knife Party\\" and \\"Passenger\\" the band's haunting collaboration with Tool and A Perfect Circle vocalist Maynard James Keenan). The record as a whole carries this same darkly intense vibe even as the music fluctuates from angry and deafening to recessed and beautiful, perhaps the main thrust that makes listening to this record such an exhilarating, memorable experience. <br />White Pony, their third album, marks perhaps the full evolution of the Deftones as a band. And, in essence, they have accomplished what bands hope to do with a third record by honing in on the strengths of previous efforts while still unleashing new tricks to keep things interesting. They have done that and more with White Pony, showing great promise with their unique brand of spooky, dark, intense yet exhilarating hard rock. \\"Tonight I feel like more...\\" go the lyrics to \\"Digital Bath\\" and how appropriate they are. After hearing White Pony, you'll certainly feel like more and you'll expect more from the rest of the \\"new\\" hard rock pack. Highly recommended.

B000021YQV|5.0|I share my experience because I feel it may be similar to other folks who haven't gotten on the System bandwagon yet.  Before I owned Toxicity, I saw System in concert and absolutely HATED them.  I had heard, of course, Sugar and Spiders from their self-titled album, but knew very little about them.  The blazing fast, sticcato (sp?) rhythyms didn't jibe well with what I was used to hearing.  It doesn't belong in the burgeoning rap-core genre, nor does it belong in the classic dark-metal arena, there's too much energy here.  After repeatedly hearing my friends praise Toxicity right and left, I decided to pick up the album.  After a few listens, finally I get it.<br />Toxicity will absolutely blow your mind.  It's an adrenaline charged non-stop ride.  It is a drug that you can't get enough of.  The songs ruminate in your head and the only way to get them out is to listen at high volume.  Unfortunately, listening to the album only puts the songs back in your head!  The album could just as well be one continuous song, it flows so well and rarely stops for air.  Serj's beautiful voice on top of the brutal guitars and make a truly awesome combo.  Even guitarist Daron's frequent backup vocals are amazing.  Listening to the album (and having the lyrics) really helps to understand there is a deeper meaning behind each and every one of the songs.  Goodness!  Raw energy AND meaningful lyrics?  System is indeed a rare commodity nowadays.<br />So now, I recently saw System of a Down again at Ozzfest.  I was totally charged to see the place blow up.  However, I looked around the crowd and saw so many that were like me, who just didn't get it.  I'd say about 30% of the audience was -really- into the music.  These are the people who own Toxicity.  I was convinced that, like most bands, the live performance would be slower and more laid-back.  Not true!  System's live performance is every bit as energetic as the album, if not more so.  Please do yourself a favor and get this album!<br />Thank you System of a Down, finally I get it.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think Avril Lavigne's cd is one of the best out there....i mean she wrote all her songs on the cd....(which is hard to say about all the Britney wannabes)....and she is very talented....and not afraid to be herself....every song on the cd is catchy and they all tell a story....which is what i like to hear...hopefully she comes out w/ another cd...because it will probably be just as great
B00005JL3A|4.0|If you've seen movies like \\"Alien\\" + it's sequels, movies like Predator or other SciFi-Action-Horror-Comedy movies the story of this one won't come to you as a surprise.<br />A team of military guys enter a secret facility to \\"save the world\\". People die, only few make it out alive.<br />I found the element of amnesia of one of the main charakters (Alice) interesting. Though this element has been used many times in other movies it nevertheless keeps the movie interesting, as Alice tries to find out who she is, what she did in the past and why she did it.<br />So what else is to say about a movie featuring a basic story that has been told many times before?<br />To enjoy the movie (any movie like that) you have to focus on other elements that make a movie, which mainly would be the \\"how is the story told\\", and I think the way this story is told is worth 2 stars. Esp. since the movie is not trying to be funny or too entertaining (which I really hate about horror movies).<br />If a movie intends to scare (regardless how cheap the scares are) comic relief is always misplaced.<br />Worth mentioning is, that the AI is not the usual [bad]-software that simply goes berzerk, or follows a plan of it's own or wants to rule the world. The AI most of the time in this movie makes sense and is simply doing what it was programmed to do.<br />The rest is action and suspense. Predictable sometimes, but who cares. People who want to be amused by a movie should watch comedy, not horror. People who want movies to make sense should watch the news (even that doesn't always make sense) and not action-horror-suspense movies.
1559277246|1.0|REVIEW IS FOR AUDIO ONLY!!!  I have all of the Stephanie Plum series in hardback and audio.  I can't wait for the next book to be released.  HOWEVER, I didn't even finish listening to Hard Eight.  The narrator read Stephanie Plum like she was a private school graduate.  She was too precise and definitely didn't come from the 'burg.  I was extremely disappointed in this audio.  If Lorelei King continues to narrate Stephanie Plum, I will no longer purchase these on audio.
1573225517|3.0|This book is in the top half of my &quot;favorite books&quot; list, but I don't think I will read it again because although it was entertaining, I was happy to stop reading about such a neurotic pessimist.  He couldn't become unjudgemental or mature fast enough.  We all have our gliches, and it is somewhat charming in a main character, but I remember this book more for the character's never-ending immaturity than it making me laugh.
B00003CXUM|5.0|The plot is less than simple... I would have left it for the soaps... Married couple.... Cheating... Who cheats who?... bla bla bla...<BR>Actually very dull... right?<BR>WRONG!!!<BR>This is a great movie, the ambientation, the colors (for Christ Sake, THE COLORS!!!), the music and even the acting... All is magnificently coordinated in a moving canvass  that unfolds before your eyes.<BR>After seeing this one there can be no doubt: Hollywood has a lot, and I mean A LOT TO LEARN.<br />No dinos, no clones, no special effects, just a couple of great people with a vision... and what a vision it is!!!
0783226152|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I love it! Carol and John are maybe the best part of the movie....but that's just my humble opinion. <BR>I was kind of skeptical about watching it, since it is a George Lucas film and I am not particularly fond of Star Wars, but i was wrong to be.  It's funny right from the get-go. <BR>I definitely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.
0393317552|4.0|This book was a school assignment for me, and as a teenager with a vocabulary made up of slang, I was suprisingly able to understand this book and fulfill my all my curiosities about how and why the world developed the way it did. Jared Diamond wrote his book in a unique way: he asked the questions, and then went on the explain them. This made his point clear and understandable. Although Mr. Diamond covered numerous questions in each chapter, he thoroughly explained his answers and did not rush one to understand his logic. This is a great book with only 2 flaws: it requires 100% attentiveness, and it takes forever to read!! :-)

0312265859|5.0|You will wonder through the whole book is this really a mystery or a love story. Will Stephanie finally commit to Ranger or Joe? Will Stephanie ever stop keeping the gun in the cookie jar? Janet provides another humorous and exciting dose of mystery to her readers. If you are not a fan, you will be after reading hard eight.
B000059XUI|3.0|This film unlike the first one failed to live up it's potential.<br />The plot of this film is what I really liked. Here we have three super villians against one superman and that was one of the films highpoints. So what went wrong to Superman 2 Basically this film is missing three important things.<br />No. 1 Marlon Brando. Why hasnt he come back for this film? Besides his scenes were COMPLETED for this movie but why removing him over some petty profit law suit (check Amazon's quote and trivia).<br />No. 2 Richard Donner. He was really good with the first one. Salkind should have let him finish this one off. Also why did the give this one to Lester? Lester is more into comedy and it destroyed the film. Although some comedy would not have hurt, but this was too much.<br />No. 3 John Williams. Here we have one of the greatest composers of our era. But sadly he did not return. He always writes new musical notes for sequels hence making the movie more refreshing. Instead we have his music from the first one recomposed from an unknown composer (they should just have just pasted his first music for this film if they  wanted to save money). Then again he was busy composing for the Empire Strike Back (one of his best works).<br />If you love the first superman and if you are over 21. Then you will be dissapointed.  But if you just want to have a good time then by all means Enjoy.
0060930187|1.0|The Bell Jar is a story of a teenage girl, Ester Greenwood, who dives deeper and deeper into depression, rejection & suicidal thoughts.  The novel starts out with Ester's internship in NYC for a magazine, all seems normal.  However, when Ester returns home she is on a downward spiral, eventually going through with her suicide thoughts and ending up in an instutition.<br />Not having suffered from depression and self-esteem issues, it was hard for me to relate to Ester and her troubles.<br />The Bell Jar is a a very sad tale of depression, thoughts of suicide, belonging and self-worth.
B00006G8G4|2.0|I'm a big Spider-man fan, and I know one thing, that Spider-man: The movie could be anything, but true to the comics.&lt;br /&gt;<br />  I have all the first magazines published and from the beggining, Spider-man always used a web shooter and not web coming out of his wrists. That was a great error that they made on this movie. The other big error is that Spidey never met Mary Jane before he fought the Green Goblin, actually, the first guy he fought was the Chameleon, took him about another 5 vilains to fight before he fought the green goblin the first time, and he never really killed him!!! A big hoax, that's what this movie is! &lt;br /&gt;<br />  It is great to have a spidey movie, but they could at least not invent so many stuff, they could respect a little bit more Stan Lee's idea.
0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT is a mesmerizing, entrancing read, peopled with complex, naive, yet accessible characters, set in dangerous pre-WWII England, with Hitler on the march and much of London unaware of what's to come.<br />Briony Tallis, the catalyst for much of what happens in ATONEMENT, is a pre-adolescent dreamer who is not fully aware of all things adult, and as a result she changes the course of many lives. Her sultry sister, Cecilia, and the charwoman's son, Robbie Turner, also live on the expansive grounds of the rural estate outside of London. What was a dinner party planned on a gloomy day becomes the turning point of the novel -- perhaps. It is difficult at times to figure out what's real and what isn't. McEwan deftly turns us from the realistic to the chaotic to the unreal, and by the end of the book, which will keep you up several nights in a row absorbing the beautiful words, you aren't sure what's happened, and might believe, as others do, that McEwan has compromised the story with the ending, hamstrung a 400+ page novel with the strange few final pages. I am not a fan of the ending, but the second and third parts of this book more than make up for that. You'll find some of the best wartime narrative in fiction in these pages.<br />A brilliant work, truly, one of the best novels I've read in years.
0316666343|5.0|Sebold took a risk in how she chose to structure her novel.  Conventional wisdom tells us to stay within the lines as we apply our craft.  I'm so glad Ms. Sebold decided to set her own boundaries.  This book is not always an easy read, but I highly recommend it.  The end makes the often harrowing passages well worth it.  Beautifully done!
B000069HKH|5.0|There's some confusion in these reviews: what are we supposed to be evaluating when we make a judgment (at this early stage, bound to be a snap judgment) about \\"The Rising\\"?<br />Are we to measure it against other Springsteen albums?  It certainly includes his finest work since \\"Nebraska,\\" but it also includes several songs whose lyrics are stretched thin across their repetitive hooks. It's great to hear the E Street Band together again, but the wonderfully muscular violin work from Soozie Tyrell leaves little room to showcase Clemons' saxophone. It's unlikely many of us will pull out this album to relax to after a hard day at work, or spin it to rev up a party. (Some tracks, though, like \\"Worlds Apart\\", \\"Further On Up the Road\\", and \\"Meet Me at Mary's Place\\" are going to turn up on a lot of party mixes.) We'll have to make time to *attend* to it, and is that a criticism or a recommendation? Considered solely as a Springsteen album, for musical and lyrical quality, it's a four, four and a half star near-classic.<br />Or should we measure it as a response to and a means of coping with September 11? If so, there's no way to avoid five stars. <br />When Bruce began recording thirty years ago, only Walter Cronkite had the credibility and gravity to sum up for America collective moments like the moon landing and our reluctant discovery that Vietnam had been a well-meant mistake. But the Boss has banked thirty years of unshakeable emotional honesty, and today he is the one all of us, at any rate all of us under sixty, can trust to speak about our national trauma without any agenda other than telling the truth, comforting the wounded, honoring the dead, and summoning us all to the best that is in us. And he does that here, in song after song. He re-invokes the spirit we all felt in those first few months, the shared shock and grief and support and determination, unsullied by all the later exploitations by hucksters and politicians.<br />Debate will continue, as it should,as to what kind of monument can fittingly be raised over New York City to commemorate the victims and heroes of September 11. But it is hard to imagine that any more fitting monument can ever be raised over the country as a whole than this one, that one son of New Jersey has built out of music. It towers.
0679409920|1.0|It is a shame that great writers like Greene just can't seem to give up on their Marxist sympathies. The main character in this book resist actually becoming a communist, but by the end of this book Greene removes any doubt that he is one of the unfortunate, naive leftist writers who was still holding out hope for the communists to get it right. Greene knew about the horrors of communism but in this book the good guys are all Soviets and, of course, the bad guys are all those callous, racists, greedy capitalists. Perhaps he never learned what an unbelievable racist Marx (not to mention Lenin and Stalin)actually was? I picked this book up at a used book store because I had read so many other spy writers compared to Greene. To ensure no one else will make the same mistake I did, I am throwing it away.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|I know, I know, some people may disagree with me on that considering the other films that were nominated for best picture (and best director), but this film earned each award and every good review it has garnered. It was beautifully done, wonderfully directed, written and acted by members of the Hollywood A-list.  Russel Crowe plays John Nash, a brilliant mathemitician who was also has schizophrenia.  Now granted people who have schizophrenia usually hear their delusions and do not see them, but it is possible for them to also see them, as it is with Nash in this movie.<br />The performances from all actors are superb and Russel Crowe is excellent as the troubled Nash who has to deal with his disease and learn to live with himself  in the course of the movie.  The supporting cast are just as good with Ed Harris and jennifer Connely turning in the best performances though the other cast are no slouches by any means.  <br />This is a movie to be respected and taken on its merits of mature moviemaking. It may not be as flashy as &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; or as mind-bending as &quot;Memento,&quot; but it is a movie not to miss.  It deserved best picture, seeing the movie only cements that achievement.
0316666343|5.0|The unusual narrative form and subject matter of this book are what initially drew me to it and I loved every page. Sebold tells the story through the murdered protagonist's eyes, (Susie Salmon, who we can relate to because she could be any one of us). The writing has definite characteristics of experimental contemporary fiction, southern gothic, and even a thriller with an intense structure focusing on the lives of her family and friends and how differently they deal with her death. Full of wonderful surprises and twists that will make you laugh and cry, it can also be considered didactic in that it helps \\"unstatisticize\\" so many of the missing and murdered girls we hear about all too often today and in the past.
B00000IQC8|4.0|Clerks is the story of two foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed 20-something men, one of whom works in a convenience store and the other who works in the video store next door.  Since their jobs are mind-numbingly dull, they entertain each other with arguments about which Star Wars film is the best, the sexual exploits of their girlfriends, and complaining about their dim-witted customers (one of which checks every egg on the shelf, trying to find \\"the perfect dozen,\\" and another that asks for \\"that movie that was out last year, you know, with that guy in it.\\")  The convenience store clerk, Dante, is also in midst of a relationship crisis with the return of an ex-girlfriend.  Rounding out the regulars (I hesitate to call them \\"stars\\") are Jay and Silent Bob, the drug dealers that hang out in front of the store.<br />This film is very funny - I laughed often.  However, the humour is quite crude (it originally got an NC-17 for the language alone!), and is therefore not for everyone.  However, people in my (and Kevin Smith's) generation will certainly recognise the kernal of truth in the characters - we've all known a drug dealer, had a foul-mouthed slacker friend, and worked in tedious jobs.  That's not to say the film is realistic, more of a parody of real life that is great fun at the same time.<br />Nothing much happens in the film, but the screenplay by director Kevin Smith (who also plays Silent Bob) is so much fun that nothing needs to happen.  It's great fun to watch the amateur actors put in better performances than a many of Hollywood stars, especially in the long takes (often 5+ minutes) that is a trademark of this film.  The quality of the filming is poor - it is grainy and barely focussed - and the sound isn't great either.  However, that's part of the charm (almost like watching through the stores' surveillance comeras), and this DVD edition makes no attempt to clean the material up.<br />This DVD has a few neat extras, like the original ending (basically, the sameending with 30 seconds more footage), a music video by Soul Asylum (that Smith directed and in which Jay lip-synchs and Silent Bob plays guitar), and some cut scenes.  The commentary is a little disappointing, although it does include some neat tidbits on casting, the identities of the actors (for example, Smith's mother is in the film), etc.
6305537321|4.0|A sweet movie that never fails to cheer me up.  Even the cat's performance is perfect.  It would have been about 10 times better without the Mickey Rooney character, however.<br />If you don't feel like crying at the last scene, you'd better make sure you still have a pulse.
0441008356|5.0|Just finished it last night. This is def. the best sci-fi book I have read this year. OUTSTANDING. Reynolds has created his view of the future and it is weird, dark, unique, and one that I want to explore. His glimpses into the past left me wanting to know more about dozens of different threads.
6304500831|5.0|This is by far disney's best animation ever!<br />Mowgli is sassy, resourceful and independent without being in the least bit irritating.  Something none of todays animation movies (with the exception of chicken run) seem capable of achieveing.<br />This is long before the days of computerized everything, each scene is a genius work of just watercolors and ink pen.<br />The most hilarious scenes are those of Col hathi and his jungle march. The jazz bit with the monkeys is a very close second.<br />&quot;The bare necessities of life...&quot; could be the byword by which we live.<br />Sher khan, Col. haathi evoke days of british imperialism with ease.  These characters and those of Kaa, Bhageera, Bhalo and of couse Mowgli will surely live on forever in the hearts of those of us who were young and innocent when this movie came out.  <br />Hopefully the video will bring home the magic to my kids and everyone in their generation.
1559277254|4.0|Half the fun of listening to the Stephanie Plum series has been the realistic \\"Jersey\\" accent of the previous narrators. This audio is so dissapointing!! The books are written in \\"first person\\" and there is no way the reader can believe this well bred narration is Stephanie Plum! The narration is so \\"out of character\\" it is a distraction. I am an avid audio listener and my reccomendation is---buy the book!
B0000683DH|5.0|Ok, first off I consider this one of the best (if not THE best) Star Trek films ever made.  So of course I purchased the Director's Edition DVD right when it came out and was I ever impressed!<br />This is a great version.  Interestingly, only about 5 minutes of footage were re-included (which somehow made it onto the TV version but never the feature film) and they don't change anything, they simply add a little more spice to some scenes and clear up the reason for the interest in that one particular young engineer who died after the attack.<br />One great thing however was the Director's commentary of the film.  Often these tend to lag a bit for me, they get these old actors and directors who are struggling to remember who they were playing or what they were trying to say 30 years ago and many of them simply sound like they're doing it for the money.  Nick Meyer entertains throughout, telling stories about the shoot, the actors, the lore of Star Trek, and his philosophy of directing as if he just made the movie.  His insights are sharp and to me actually contributed much to the film.  And for those of you who are worried that he just goes on and on, don't.  Meyer seems to pause at all the right times to just let us soak in the film for a moment before going back to his discussion.  Worth it for this alone (I can hardly wait for the director's edition of Star Trek VI, Meyers other Star Trek film)!<br />So if you are the sort who involuntarily scream \\"KHAN\\" at people who annoy you, you must get this version of the film!  And if you don't understand what I just said with that last sentence then just pass it by.
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is just awesome. The story is of a convicted murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbings) that is accused his wife and the man she was cheating with. Dufresne is thrown into a correctional facility called Shawshank prison. He is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman) who also is serving a life-term for murder. A rough first two years of getting harshly beaten by fellow inmates, Andy gets used to prison life. His friend Red is known to be able to get things for the inmates from the outside world, cigarretes, whiskey, playing cards, or whatever. When Andy asks Red to get him a small rock hammer, Red thinks he is crazy. But on the outside world, along with being a banker, Dufresne was very interested in geology and rocks, and is convinced he can escape with his knowledge.<BR>        Many years pass, and Andy gains lots of respect from all of the prison. His financial knowledge helps alot of the guards to figure out trust funds and other things that they can do with their money. He ends up basically managing the whole prison's budget. He sends away hundreds of letters asking for fundings for a better library from the government. After eight years or so, he gets around 700 dollars and buys books and builds a nice library. A prisoner that Andy befriends comes to Shawshank, and Andy helps him get his high school diploma. One day, Red is telling Billy (the prisoner that Dufresne helps) about why Andy is in Shawshank. Billy is shocked, and claims that one of his cellmates at another prison said that he had commited that exact crime. Andy hears this, and goes to the Warden (the head of the prison) and tells him this. The Warden doesn't believe him. Andy calls him some bad names, and pays for it with 2 months in solitary confinement. When Andy gets out, he decides he's had enough. He decides it is time to escape from Shawshank.<BR>          The rest I cannot tell you, you need to see for yourself. The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie. It really portrays another world. I definetly reccomend it to anyone.
B00000FZQ8|1.0|The number of reviews calling this movie a \\"scifi classic\\" and a \\"masterpiece with a message\\" is truly dumbfounding.<br />Ok, it does have a few strengths... the special effects and sets are quite well done, the mood is relaxed and the droids are actually kind of cute... but the bad just totally overshadows the good...<br />First, Bruce Dern's character is not at all likable and his dialoge is irritatingly bad. He sounds like a whiny, adolescent boy... and acts like it, right down to the tantrums, mood swings and fits of violence. You quickly realize that you're not watching a sane, distinguished scientist, but rather a boy scout who never grew up.<br />Second, nothing is done to ground the movie's basic notion in believability. Why can't the forests stay on Earth in preserves? Who in the world would pay billions to save the forests when, apparently, no one cares for them on Earth? Why are there only 4 people onboard this huge space freighter?<br />Other bad points:<BR>Music - It is laughably folksongish. It's bad enough when it's just instrumental, but the 3 or 4 times when it breaks into verse could drive a sane person to suicide.<BR>Character Development - Very little to speak of... unless you consider Freeman Lowell's increasing insanity to be character development.<BR>Plot confusion - There are a few places where poor editing or whatnot makes the story hard to follow. Expect to do some rewinding while you're watching.<br />Now, on a more positive note...<BR>This movie is so funny in its seriousness that you'll be unable to stop laughing. Silent Running is, hands down, the funniest movie not meant to be funny that I've ever seen. From seeing Freeman Lowell whine and pout early on to going postal like a cross-circuited droid, just about every scene is hilarious, and I mean that with the utmost seriousness. Every time that I recall the final scene with the droid carefully watering the plant with a flower-nosed bucket, I lose my composure and bust up with laughter.The movie was worth watching just for the endless laugh that that one scene gave me.<br />It's really too bad that this movie IS so bad. The general idea and style of direction could've made into a pretty good movie. As it is, though, it's utterly spoiled by heavy-handed hippy propaganda. I think that it backfired on its makers, though, because it unwittingly paints the radical environmentalist as a madman more concerned with plants than humans, willing to murder human lives to protect insensate plants. That, in itself, is rather funny, but it also smudges the reputation of all reasonable scientists and environmentalists.<br />If you're so deadly serious that none of what I've said sounds funny or bad, you'll love the movie; otherwise, rent this one for the laughs.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Any form of media that makes you think has succeeded in what it set out to do.Donnie Darko is a film that succeeds on every conceivable level. The script is original and entirely unpredictable. There isn't a single bit of action or dialogue, not one frame that can be anticipated. The characters, too, are refreshingly well-conceived and highly unique. And it's a treat to see actors we know well (Drew Barrymore, who also produced, and Noah Wyle) stretch well beyond our usual expectations. There is great humor in this film as well as great sorrow. And, ultimately, it's impossible to say if the entire scenario takes place within the dreams of a brilliant but possibly schizophrenic young man or if, as he so desperately wishes, he has, through physics, managed to reverse time.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal gives a stunning performance as Donnie. Even his body language--incurving shoulders, questioning eyes, uncertain smiles--reveal a vast, searching intelligence. Mary McDonnell gives yet another in a roster of thoughtful portrayals--this time as the despairing mother of brilliant and troubled Donnie, simultaneously loving and hating him for being emotionally beyond her reach. And Jena Mallone is just wonderful, one of the truest, most authentic young actors around today.<br />This is filmmaking at its best--an adventure for the mind--not to be missed.<BR>Most highly recommended.

7119005901|1.0|The characters are lifeless, the action mired in quicksand, and the price outrageous.  What were the other reviewers thinking??
B00005K3NR|4.0|Carrie is probably the strangest horror film I have seen and that is saying a lot. Sissy Spacek does a very good job as Carrie as does Piper Laurie as Carrie's crazed religious mom. I think there a few funny instances in this movie and a lot of funny lines (probably none of this was supposed to be funny). It takes a long time to climax but when it does you'll see this movie has the most drastic turn of any movie I've ever seen.(I don't want to give anything away). This sin't a scary film though in my opinion. Scarier Stephen King books that are films are The Shining and It. In general this is a solid rental however i wouldn't buy it unless you find it for under about [price]. \\"We'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness!\\"
0316666343|5.0|It goes without saying that there are people who will not like or even want to read this book.  the subject matter is difficult and one knows from the second sentence that there can be no completely happy ending.  However, this is absolutely one of the most beautifully crafted books I have ever read.  Sebold's prose is simple, powerful and enthralling.  It must also be said that this is not a perfect book and there are some aspects of the ending that did not sit well with me.  This is definately one of those books that is about the journey not the destination.  Susie, Lindsay, Buck and the rest feel like family to me and I will revist them time and again.
B000063DI9|5.0|This Iron maiden album took me the longest to get into. The first time I heard Infinite Dreams I thought \\"what? this isn't the Iron Maiden I know!\\" and then when I started playing Can I Play with Madness my jaw dropped at the awful cheesy intro. I was about ready o give up on it until I found a few great tracks I could jump right into such as The Clairvoyant and Only the Good Die Young. And soon enough every song captured me. This is not the best Iron maiden album (for that see the Number of the Beast) but to me it is the most special because it has so many relaxing (the end of the Prophecy for example) and to me, mature tracks. Of the 8 iron maiden albums I own this is the most mature except for the X factor. A great album such as this always has its cons though...<br />Moonchild- interesting intro of the seven deadly sins which leads to a keyboard and guitar interlude. I especially like the synths on this track and the chorus. Bruce sounds angry though so I can't say the vocals are the greatest but they do fit the song well. A good opener- A-<br />Infinite Dreams- better vocals than the opener however much softer. Fans of Killers and their other harder and faster cds may not enjoy this ong as others but it does have some great solos and riffs in the second half of the song. Includes a good chorus- A<br />Can I Play With Madness- most people love or hate this song. I am neutral. I must say the intro vocals almost ruin the song, but musically this is not bad by any means. The most cheesy song since Quest for Fire but if you just listen to the music and forget the singing and horrible lyrics then its really not that bad.- B<br />The Evil that Men Do- I must say the first few times I heard this I had no idea why everyone thought it was so great. But the song grew on me and now it is one of my favorites from the album. The first chorus is about living on the edge and that leads into a great second chorus which carries the song. - A<br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son- the most epic and the most different. The intro shows this song has power. Bruce wails in parts of this song and to this day I dont know how he hasnt lost all his vocal chords yet. The song gets very strange towards the middle but then it explodes into 3 minutes of solos.- A-<br />The Prophecy- how could anyone say this song is bad? In fact it's my favorite. The beautiful intro leads into the powerful guitars and verses. The chorus isn't anything special but the solos afterwards are. I think this song puts the most visions in your mind while listening, especially during the last minute which contains the most beautiful Iron Maiden acoustic instrumental there is. Incredible. A+<br />The Clairvoyant- good guitar riffs and a good chorus. Basically its a great song that everyone should hear. - A<br />Only the Good Die Young- contains the best lyrics (for example, \\"The demond in your mind will rape you in your bed at night... and \\"Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust...\\") and the best chorus. My only gripe is that it is too short. #2 only to The Prophecy. - A+<br />If you are an Iron Maiden fan you should get this cd immediately but I don't know if I can recommend it to others unless they have heard other Iron maiden albums before this. Even for fans like me this record took a while to get into (a lot longer than any of their other albums). But once you get used to it, it will become one of your favorite records by them. Five stars.
0316666343|5.0|this book is especially touching, even heartwrenching. Alice Sebold, of course, did not know when she labored over this beautiful, haunting book that killed kids would be headlines this summer of 2002. Especially the Elizabeth Smart case, unsolved, resonated for me while reading this. A really powerful read, and I add my 2 cents to the many others who loved it. Whether it would have affected me less without this zeitgeist, I have no way of knowing.
B00006950W|4.0|I'm tired of people talking down about this movie.  I wouldn't have seen it at the theaters twice if I didn't think it was a good movie.  This movie has lots of action and plenty of gore...  I can't wait for the next installment.  The only thing I don't like is that this movie was released on dvd but it hasn't been released on vhs yet.  What's the deal with that?!!  That's why I bought it here for [$].  I wouldn't go through the trouble of trying to find it on the net if it wasn't a good movie.  Bottom line...  In my opinion, this movie is well worth the watch!
B0000636UN|5.0|I'm not the biggest Sheryl Crow fan in the world, but I have to admit this is one awesome album. It is one that you will sing along with on each song. It is by far the most entertaining release since her first album. The song &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; is probably the most infectious song this year. &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is also an excellent track that you can't get out of your head when you hear it. &quot;You're An Original&quot; is another song that would be perfect for radio. It's rare that an artist can be so creative and still come up with music that is so catchy and radio-friendly. This is a top notch release that is a &quot;must have.&quot;
B000069CWE|5.0|I didn't know whether or not I would want to buy this CD because I didn't want it to be the same as the original one, but I'm glad I did buy it.  It's not a new CD, it just gives a new twist to their original songs from Hybrid Theory.  I would only recommend this for huge Linkin Park fans, though, because you have to really like the original songs to like this CD.  My favorite song on the CD was &quot;Krwlng&quot;  (remix of &quot;Crawling&quot;), because I'm a Staind fan also and it features Aaron Lewis.  I think the remix of &quot;In the End&quot; was all right, but they basically turned it into a rap song and took the hardness out of it.  They did that with a few other songs, such as &quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot;.  I think it is overall a good CD, and I basically like what they did with the songs.  &quot;My December&quot; and &quot;High Voltage&quot; I really haven't listened to a lot, mainly because I found them boring.  But hey, there's 17 other songs on the CD, so it's definitely worth it.
B00005RYLE|4.0|What's in side is great, but you should be warned about the cover.  Regardless of how little you handle the case, your hand will stink of curing rubber, so you won't be inclined to look at it very much. In fact, it will sit on your shelf and be avoided to keep you from getting the stuff on you.  It does come in a partial plastic case that you can pick up with less danger of having to take a trip to the sink, so it's not untouchable.  But really, who wants to have to wash their hands EVERY day?    Other than that, everyone should see this movie at least once to prove that Bruce Campell was capable something better than \\"Jack of all trades\\"  and to see how much blood really can come out of a demon!
B000066NW0|4.0|I really loved avril lavigne's cd, let go. it has real emotion, and good melodies, that i always seem to have stuck in my head. =) but, i have heard better music. quite a few artists have more talent, better music, and better lyrics, such as dido, nelly furtado, pink, shakira, etc. either way, avril is a good pic for most.

B000002J1O|5.0|It's no surprise \\"Selling England\\" comes so highly recommended on Amazon. It's the best album Genesis ever made, and therefore, one of the best albums of all time, period.  It's detractors sometimes point to the inclusion of \\"More Fool Me\\" and \\"The Battle Of Epping Forest\\"--but \\"More Fool Me\\" makes an excellent resting point after the histrionics of \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", and while \\"Epping Forest\\" does take several listens to get used to,<BR>its many colorful characters and fine band interplay are worth it.  Everything else is stunning, and \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\", \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" and \\"Cinema Show/Aisle Of Plenty\\" are three of the greatest prog-rock cuts ever created.  The conceptual focus of the album veers away from the fantasy/sci-fi<BR>elements of \\"Foxtrot\\" and into an earthier social commentary, although still informed by Gabriel's surrealist tendencies.  The result is a work which both defines and transcends its era.<br />The opening \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" begins with a lovely a capella vocal by Gabriel, followed by graceful piano ballad, earth-shaking heavy metal and spacey psychedelic fadeout which sends shivers down the spine.  The group's first pop hit \\"I Know What I Like\\" follows, and matches a clever bit of social comment with a catchy chorus and an unusual arrangement featuring electric sitar, synth, lawnmower sounds, and exotic percussion.  The epic \\"Firth Of Fifth\\" is worthy of the great<br />classical composers of the past, building mathematically from<BR>its grand piano intro through a piano/flute duet and The Guitar Solo Which Made Steve Hackett A Legend; its emotional pull <BR>defies category or description.  Side one closes with the fragile acoustic ballad \\"More Fool Me\\", Collins' solo vocal debut and a welcome bit of modest, soft-focus understatement on his part (its only real detractors are those prog fans for whom<BR>everything has to be over eight minutes in length).<br />Side two opens with the problematic \\"Battle Of EppingForest\\", for which even the band admitted that the densely inserted lyric did not allow the music room to breathe.  Nonetheless, close<BR>listening will reveal many humorous character moments, and if one can focus on the background, some great playing from the band.  The instrumental \\"After The Ordeal\\"--which almost didn't make the album--is another perfect comedown, a forlorn Hackett-led piece which is backed by Banks' typically romantic piano work.  The closing epic \\"Cinema Show/Aisle Of Plenty\\" is a<BR>fan favorite and my favorite Genesis track, moving as it does from its lacey acoustic first half to a stunningly evocative keyboard solo, synths and mellotrons providing rich layers of atmosphere.  With Hackett's solo on \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", Banks' work on \\"Cinema Show\\" and Collins' superb drumming throughout, it's no wonder this album represents for so many the pinnacle<BR>of progressive rock; the shorter numbers, \\"I Know What I Like\\"<BR>and \\"More Fool Me\\", provide a perfect counterpoint.
B00005IC2H|5.0|After introducing many listeners to their distinct sound by way of the &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; sountrack album, Icelandic quartet Sigur Rs (pronouned &quot;Seer Rose&quot; with the R's rolled) has built a following interested in expanding their tastes in music and virtually elimintaing insomnia.  Agaetis Byrjun (pronounced &quot;Ow-gate-is Beeryune&quot;), the band's third overall album to date, is their masterpiece.  It is the ultimate realization of the spectrum of human emotion, and, when accompanied by candles and a good pair of headphones, proves as an adequate cure for sleep deprevation.  The band's instrumentation is relatively simple: vocals, guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards/synthesizers.  The miracle of this is the otherworldly sound channeled through these instruments and into the ears, heart, and soul of the listener.  <BR>      The album begins with an intro, roughly a minute long, which resembles an underwater choir singing an irresistable refrain, chopped and repeated by the loopwork of keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson.  It slowly travels into the now-famous &quot;Svefn-G-Englar&quot;(Sleepwalkers) by way of the repeating ping of a sonar detector and the rumbling of an underwater submarine.  The two songs together serve as an exposition to a much grander scheme, but it is here that we are introduced to Sigur Rs' distinctive blend of angelic vocals, channeling bass work, etherreal percussion, and quite possibly the most beautiful guitar feedback ever recorded, by way of guitarist/vocalist Jonsi running a cello bow along the strings.  From this, the listener is transported into the stellar &quot;Staralfur&quot; by way of a rapidly drumming heartbeat.  From first listen, one is compelled to make a nighttime trip to an open field to gaze at a star-painted sky, revelling in the sheer beauty of life.  <BR>      Next is the hypnotic &quot;Flugufrelsarinn&quot;, brought in by a combination of wind and guitar screeching.  The song borderlines erotica, and is as irresistable as it is trance-inducing.  Brass hummings bring in &quot;Ny Batteri&quot;, a song that is altogether more melancholy in its scope as compared with the rest of the album.  It's as if the band is lost in its own emotional maelstrom, struggling to find any signs of light.  A peephole is found in the jazz-like &quot;Hjartad Hamast&quot;, which sounds like Miles Davis as interpreted by a Martian.  The peephole then tears, to become the rejuvenation that is &quot;Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa&quot;.  The longest song on the album, it is arguably the most beautiful, shifting through 4 main phrases all in one swift, breathtaking motion.<BR>      Now that the rejuvenation has been found, it is time for the youthful abandon that is &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot;.  The timely, enchanting bass riff guides the listener through a dark forest leading to a meadow, filled with a grand choir encircling a lone flutist.  Immediately following is the smile-inducing title track, &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;.  The guitar intro fades in from nothing, and the divine instrumentation makes the listener think of the same.  A flying kite comes to mind in this song.  As for &quot;Avalon&quot;, the closer, nothing will be disclosed.  It serves as a final farewell to the listener, tucking them in goodnight, and letting them rest assured that life is indeed filled with beauty, if they would only allow their ears to hear it.<BR>        Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful albums ever made.  Sigur Rs is a band not easily dismissed.  Agaetis Byrjun is an experience not easily forgotten.  Your ears, mind, heart, soul, and eyelids will love you forever.
B000002J1S|5.0|It's hard to describe the feelings which are engendered by this album, which although slightly eclipsed by its magnificent predecessor \\"Selling England By The Pound\\", nonetheless packs<BR>a pretty formidable punch.  Knock-out is more like it.  There are those for whom this album will always be a bit of mystery; like all doubles, it suffers from the \\"it should've been pared to a single\\" syndrome, and suffers (like The Who's \\"Tommy\\", The Kinks' \\"Preservation\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\") from charges<BR>of indulgence and narrative incomprehensibility.  However, \\"The Lamb\\" is not an album meant for one easy listen.  It may take years to comprehend every bit of information packed into this densely layered cinematic meisterwork, but every bit of time you put into it will be worth it.  <br />I've always felt that this album might be better comprehended as a film.  When the band took it onstage, they were accompanied by a triple-screen light show and Gabriel dressed in a variety of ultra-bizarre outfits (the most memorable being the Slipperman),<BR>although even that wasn't enough to fully tell the tale.  What's great about \\"The Lamb\\" is that even though it is a lengthy double-album rock opera, the group decided to counter this ambition by shortening the songs into more digestible portions.  Thus, many of the tracks on the album--the title cut, \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\", \\"Back In NYC\\", \\"Counting Out Time\\", \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", \\"Anyway\\", \\"The Light Dies Down On Broadway\\", \\"In The Rapids\\", \\"It\\"--stand up very well on their own as catchy pop<BR>classics, even if on initial listen the overwhelming scope of the album drowns their impact a bit.  The longer prog numbers \\"In The Cage\\", \\"The Waiting Room\\", \\"The Lamia\\" and \\"The Colony Of Slippermen\\" are all worthy of the best from \\"Foxtrot\\" or \\"Selling England\\", featuring multiple sections and much experimental instrumental interplay whereby Hackett made his guitar sound like a synthesizer, and Banks tried to make his keyboards sound like a guitar. <br />Many have given up trying to comprehend the obtuse storyline, but there have been various interpretations over the years all worthy of mention.  The decision to center the narrative around a street punk named Rael was a good one in retrospect, for it foreshadowed the punk explosion and gave the band much-needed credibility in that area.  As the story progresses Rael is sucked into an underground world where he undergoes various experiences which were analogous to his previous life, before meeting Lilywhite Lilith who begins the process of spiritual transformation within him: he meets death, makes love to The Lamia, becomes a slave to his senses, castrates himself as a cure, and finally is given a choice to save his brother John (who, as it turns out, is himself).  Only by comprehending the story can one *truly* appreciate the album to its fullest, for it makes even those moments which may seem superfluous at first have meaning (for example, the reviewer below complains that one becomes exhausted by sides three and four--however, this perfectly mirrors the exhaustion Rael must be feeling at this point).  The album's ultimate achievement comes in getting the listener to identify with Rael; if this does not happen, it's no wonder some continue to view the album as a bit of a mystery.  In a way, \\"The Lamb\\" tops every rock-opera before or after by offering more of everything: more catchy tunes, more surreal<BR>moments, more spiritual/emotional depth, more humor, more drama...
B000068QY7|5.0|Come on! Let's face it. Who apart from these boys is really playing any bloody good rock music. The pap that parades across the radio dials daily is wan even compared to the mancs at their weakest. This may not be their best, but at worst it is another good bunch of tunes to learn and sing along to. Buy it and enjoy it for what it is. Really good old fashioned R'n'R. Good on yer!
B000066NW0|5.0|Who is that tiny girl with the big voice; I thought when I first heard \\"complicated\\". Avril Lavigne is a vocal powerhouse. She has an excellent voice. Her voice is strong and a lot less annoying than Alanis Morissette. LET GO is a pop/rock treat. Avril is sound in her lyrics and the songs actually tell mini stories. Just check out \\"sk8ter boi\\" and you'll see what I mean. It's all wrapped up in a pop/punk beat. <br />Lavigne shows many sides to her personality on LET GO. She's frustrated on \\"loosing grip\\", \\"complicated\\" and \\"unwanted\\". She shows her vulnerable side on \\"I'm with you\\", \\"tomorrow\\", and \\"naked\\". She's simply sunny radio-friendly pop/rock on \\"things I'll never say\\" and \\"my world\\". Avril even raps a bit on \\"nobody's fool\\". Yes, I said rap! So again and again she proves her many talents. <br />Like Michelle Branch, Avril also plays guitar and writes her own lyrics. LET GO is a great example of a pop/rock CD. It's polished but it doesn't come off as cheesy and pre-programmed. This album is refreshing, multi-layered and very pleasing. LET GO pulls you into Avril's world for a little while.
0060934913|3.0|I eat in restaurants nearly everyday.  I find that I don't have time to cook, and there are plenty of places in town that are cheap and good.  There was a time after reading George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London that eating out brought up bad visions.  It's happened once again with Anthony Bourdain's informative and often times hilarious book, Kitchen Confidential.<br />We know that restaurants are dirtier than our own kitchens, but Bourdain explains what to look for when choosing a sanitary eating environment.  He suggests that restaurant food is better during the weekdays when a chef is preparing food for what he believes to be his regular customers, whereas weekend food is for tourists and has to be rushed by the nature of the crowds.  To hear Bourdain tell it, Sunday Brunch is the absolute worst time to eat anywhere, because the main chef is off and the food is mostly stale bread and other leftovers from throughout the week.<br />The book really serves as an autobiography of how Bourdain came to be a chef and his experiences up to the present day.  To hear him tell it, the kitchen is full of characters. He describes many of these nuts that have filled his life, and their exploits from past to present.  Some of these people are so antisocial in Bourdain's opinion that they would be hardly functional anywhere but a kitchen.  He describes a baker so doped up that he frequently missed work for a week, but he'd be welcomed back, because his bread was like no other.  In the same vein, it's not an exaggeration to say the author refers to (maybe even brags about) his own ... habit at least 20 times.<br />Bourdain does seem to have a knack for the kind of self-effacing promotion that is so popular these days with audiences.  Here's a guy that is a high paid chef at a well-known restaurant, but much of the story is about his screw-ups and feeble attempts at making a living.  His style is hard-hitting like a noir detective novel.  You'll know after 10 pages whether you'll enjoy the book.  I did.s whether you'll enjoy the book.  I did.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This is a great album.  I enjoy every song on it. My favorite is Enfilade.  The lyrics are the best part though, there really different from most bands, and they spark the imagination.  The music is great too, its really energetic.  The lead singers voice is great.  This C.D. just blows all my other C.Ds out of the water.  I recommend you all go out and buy yourself a copy.
0790736322|5.0|In terms of a MOVIE this is clearly one of the best ever made.  Only the Godfather I & II compares to it, in terms of performances, (not a single bad one) Special effects and plot it is incredible.  <br />This movie doesn't rush itself.  It slowly builds up until you just can't take it anymore.   This is high art.  All the people involved in this movie should be rightly proud.  It will outlast anything else in the Genre.  I know Linda Blair's career has paid a price for this but very few great actors have ever made a movie as great as this one.  I would rank it in the top 10 of all time easy, maybe even top 5.  That being said I watched this version only once.  I will not buy this film, or rent it again yet if it is on TV I watch it, in fact I am irresistably drawn to it;  Why, becasue it scares me!<br />     You would think that at 39 years old and a life full of real things to deal with a movie 30 years old wouldn't do that:  You'dd think wrong.<br />     This movie not only scares me it is the ONLY movie that still does.  I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm a Roman Catholic and I believe this is not out of the realm of reality, but what really seems to get me is in this movie THE DEVIL WINS!<br />     What most people don't understand is that the devil even possessing the girl can't steal her soul in the act.  The attack is more directed toward the family and the Excorcist himself.  Will he have the faith to keep up, to do the rite again and again and again.  With they have what it takes to outlast the demon.  Fr Karas does not.  He willingly accepts the devil into himself and thus gives Satan the actual win he is looking for.  In that actual case the movie is loosely based on the Excorcism lasted for months until the demon was finally driven out.    The victory of evil in this movie is very visable to me.  How it is not noted by others more often is beyond me.  <br />(I have this fantasy of the final scene where Father Merrin is on the floor and all is about to be lost when the door opens and George Burns in his fishing hat walks in [Reference Oh God series] slowly to the Amazement of Fr. Karos and the Horror of the demon.  That happy ending allowed me to sleep many times in my younger days.)  <BR>    <br />Buy it if you dare.
0385474547|1.0|I had to read this my sophomore year of high school. And of course, I had one of those teachers that was obsessed with analyzation and symbolism to the point where I even got to hate it, even though I'm a poet and a writer. The main character had a lot of mental problems, including violence, chauvinism, and overambition to become the 'model citizen' of his tribe. I had no sympathy for him, neither should you. Overall this book was very slow-moving, very dull, very boring, and as a result some of my most sardonic and thoughtful essays in that class were based upon this book. Thanks a lot!!!! Even if I was just reading this for my own personal leisure, I'd give it a relatively low grade.
B0000013G9|5.0|This cd is off the hook.  It includes the hit's waterfalls, red light special, creep, and diggin' on you.  This cd is full of R&B and sexy ballads.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  This cd is awsome.
B000002KD9|5.0|From love to bigotry, Neil Young covers a lot of emotions and a lot of social commentary on this album, and is regarded as one of his best. As a recently converted fan, I think this is his best one I've heard (so far). I always thought that some of the guitar-based compositions on this record (tell me why, when you dance, don't let it bring you down...) were some of the prettiest in rock history. Definitely stays in your head for days, and the music is still resonant even 30 years after its release. It still sounds amazing! I also enjoy his lyrics a great deal.
B000069CWE|5.0|Its very rare that people will find a \\"worth listening to\\" remix album. Hip-Hop is known for making remix albums, so i think Linkin Park is really making a statement for themselves (Since they're mostly known as a hard rock group). Therefore I give this album 5 stars. Its a very unique album because all the songs on the original album (Hybrid Theory) are remixed into new songs. My favorite tracks are In The End, A Place for my Head, and Papercut. But dont get me wrong, I listened to the whole album (about 50 times!) and its all very worth listening to. The most different part of hte album is the violin solos of Crawling in the introduction and inerludes (played by Phoenix)that prepares you for the finale (Crawling ft. Aaron Lewis of Staind). (TRUST ME- you'll fall in love with the violin solos! It's different from the same ol stuff we hear on the radio everyday!)You totally hear the talents these guys have; Even in the Art work inside the album! Its worth your money to buy!!...
B000003TAR|5.0|When compared to its accessible 'Nevermind' counterpart, 'In Utero' seems like an almost heinous concept. Many parts of 'In Utero' have an almost demo-like quality to them, with a lot louder textures and much darker lyrics. Infact, the only hits off of the album, 'Heart-Shaped Box,' and 'All Apologies' had to be remixed by R.E.M.'s producer before release. <br />This record has a totally different vibe to it when compared to 'Nevermind' or even 'Bleach.' You won't find joyous songs like 'Sliver' or 'On A Plain' here, but you'll find much superior song-writing and darker qualities. The album starts out very rough with 'Serve the Servants' and 'Scentless Apprentice' whereas 'Nevermind' started off with 'Teen Spirit' and 'In Bloom,' two big singles. Right there we know this is a different album all to itself. Tracks such as 'Milk It' and 'Tourette's' are loud freak-outs meant surely to offend 'Nevermind' listeners, while 'Heart-Shaped Box' and 'All Apologies' scored hits on a different, more emotional level. The music speaks volumes on how distressed Kurt was over his new-found fame while this album is a much harder affair, there are its soft moments like the muted, gentle 'Dumb.'<br />All in all this might prove as a difficult listen on the first spin, or even subsequent listens, but it is a much more satisfying album than 'Bleach' (which is somewhat inconsistent but still very fun) and 'Nevermind' (which is a great album without a bad song, but still falls short of 'In Utero'). It's such a shame that Kurt's morale fell so low and it was obvious that his guitar playing and songwriting was going so high. Also check out their video 'Live! Tonight! Sold Out!' though it doesn't feature any songs from 'In Utero' on it, it is still a very fun and insightful video about Nirvana with some great live performances.
0312265859|5.0|Hard Eight was great; however, it was just slightly under par for the Stephanie Plum series.
B000002KAG|4.0|I don't agree with any assessment of this album as &quot;rushed&quot;.  It sounds to me like a solid debut album, up there with the Beatles and Buffalo Springfield and whoever else you care to mention, that prefigures the band's sound and approach for many years to come (a diverse, confident mix of blues, folk, and rock).<br />To those who complain that the tracks are too short to get &quot;psychedelic&quot;, I point to the closing 10-minute version of &quot;Viola Lee Blues&quot; which is pretty trippy.  Including the clever little trick that Jerry does which makes it seem as if the LP is stuck.  On that track, as well as &quot;Cold Rain and Snow&quot;, &quot;Cream Puff War&quot;, and &quot;Morning Dew&quot;, each sung by Garcia, Jerry comes across as by far the most interesting band member.  But Pigpen and Weir each make reasonable contributions (singing covers).<br />It's &quot;of it's time&quot; and it holds together reasonably well.  About half of it's brilliant, and that's a pretty good ratio.
B00000IBRX|4.0|What a lovely film.  The plot is quite different from most of the light-hearted movies of Robin Williams previous credits.  There are still areas of comedy, but, overall, this is a film to be watched when you desire a good cry.  You would have to have a stone heart not to cry when you watch this. The plot is strong and the charachters interact well.  The scenes that describe Anabella's Hell are poinant and well scripted.  I have never seen a better depiction of hell.  What a surprise ending!

Understanding color.  It's not as easy as it sounds but if you have the right tools and the right people teaching you, you can pull of awesome designs.<br />Also, when it comes to color...it's hard when over the phone, a client or agency wants an ad in a certain color.  \\"I would like a color between burgundy and red\\", \\"I want a dark forest green but not too dark or too light\\" and with your color booklet, you can either take it to the client or agency and have them pick it out and then what's next?<br />Your client wants an orange ad, a red ad, a neutral ad, something energetic, something playful, something... But what other colors would go with that orange, that red, that neutral, etc.<br />For many years I have heard and read about Leatrice Eiseman aka the color guru and the presentations she has given to different groups about understanding color and how color can make a big difference in one's life.<br />I have to admit that my head was spinning in the last few weeks because although I felt I was good with color, I've been given work which used colors that I would not normally pick for ads.  But as a designer, you need to make it happen and thus knowing Eiseman's role and how she has help many people understand color, I looked toward the \\"Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color\\".<br />I have spent a lot of money on color booklets but this book literally... let's just say that I'm happy and has brought new life to my work.<br />Not only does she break down the colors and certain moods, for each section is a section for color combinations.  She goes into the choices of colors and why they are appropriate and why the work.  On the page before it are magazine ads that used those appropriate colors and I was just amazed.<br />Before I would stick with certain colors for certain moods and most of the time, they were the same Pantone colors but now thanks to this book, I'm not afraid to take the step in utilizing other colors for different moods and I can quickly reference what other colors combinations would work for my ads.<br />I don't know how I can emphasize how useful this book is as a tool and reference book.  It goes beyond to what I expected.  If you want to understand color and help your designs to make up a certain mood, this book is highly recommended as the first book under the $50 range!
