B000051VWW|5.0|When Sade ended her 8 year abscence from the music scene with &quot;Lovers Rock,&quot; it was as if she never left at all.  The key to her success is consistency and originality, two qualities you'll find on the seductive &quot;Lovers Rock.&quot;  I have to admit that if I reviewed this CD upon release, I probably would have given it 3 stars, as I wasn't really wild about it initially.  But after seeing her live, which inspired me to revisit the disc several times, it grew on me and now it sounds even better.  The first noticeable thing on this disc is the reggae flavor the band delivers, as evidenced on the first single, &quot;By Your Side.&quot;  &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; is an excellent track which finds our heroine warning a lover that she's been bruised in a previous relationship.  &quot;Immigrant&quot; is a tough look at racism, and the single &quot;King of Sorrow,&quot; a lush, jazzed-up soul number, is classic Sade.  I wouldn't want Sade to take another 8 year break before she releases her next album, but &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; is a disc fine enough to satisfy our appetite until she returns again.
B0000640VN|1.0|Here's Meg again, with that spiky bad hair (what's that about anyway?) and a part we've seen her play umpteen times before. The screenplay is trite and mean-spirited at the outset; it descends into stupid and even gross (I really don't want to see a rearview shot of a dog doing its business.) This movie goes beyond bad all the way to terrible. Don't waste your time or your money. Poor Hugh Jackman is stuck in this movie, trying his best to do something with his role. And this is yet another of Meg's really bad choices. If you have a burning need to see her, get Sleepless In Seattle. It's a sweet-natured film, worth seeing.
0312965788|5.0|I first read this book when I was fourteen. Got it at the library in Danville, Arkansas, as I recall during a summertime visit with aunts, uncles and cousins. Hated to put it down every morning and go to swimming lessons. Hated to put it down to eat. Hated having to turn out the lights and get some shut-eye. This book is about the joys and the struggles of everyday life, and of triumphs great and small. It's a book about animal husbandry and the way people connect with animals, even when they have trouble connecting to other people.<br />I've read this book three or four times since that summer so very long ago. It is brilliantly written. What a great investment of your time if you choose to read this wonderful tale of life as a veterinarian in a faraway country.
6300213714|5.0|\\"The Warriors\\" is perhaps the definitive cult film -- a flick you always enjoy seeing again. <br />The story is about a Coney Island gang that gets wrongly accused of murder and must make it back home from the Bronx, fighting enemy gangs and police all the way. <br />The 'feel' of the movie is part surreal, part realistic and wholly captivating! <br />... \\"The Warriors\\" is just a great flick full of memorable scenes and lines. I really love the ending where, after being vindicated, the Warriors walk down the Coney Island beach while the DJ offers them a tribute song -- \\"Survival In the City\\" by Walsh/Eagles.<br />I also like the fact that the Warriors is a racially mixed gang -- a group of lost souls in the urban jungle, banded together perhaps for no other reason except for the obvious fact that they're from the same urban cesspool and have a need to belong.<br />I stated that the movie is part realistic, but only in the sense that it never becomes campy; the creators and cast properly take it all quite serious. Other than that, the flick showcases a mesmerizing fantastical New York City, that could never be mistaken for reality.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Despite a few inconsistencies and contrivances, Spy Games is one of the better espionage films to hit the streets in quite some time.  The story is intelligent, the action is brisk and the suspense taut.<br />Tony Scott orchestrates the project well, perhaps overdoing the musical element a bit, but pacing well and creating an effective weave between flashbacks and current day events.  Yet, there are a couple of areas that bothered me.  First, Muir (Robert Redford) was consistently developed throughout the film to be a hardened leader, always looking at the big picture and following the imperative regardless of the human cost.  So, his rogue operation to save Bishop is completely out of character.  Not only is it difficult to believe that the CIA would have been fooled by some of his deceptions, it is hard to swallow the fact that he would have risked everything to pursue a rescue that was antithetical to his training, beliefs and personality.  <br />It is also difficult to understand how Bishop was allowed to stay in the field, given his penchant for disobeying orders and his continual development of emotional attachments to his various human assets.  Such recklessness would never have been tolerated, because it would have endangered him, the assets, and would have potentially compromised whatever mission he was working on.  However, I suppose I need to cut the writers a little slack or otherwise there would have been no story.<br />Robert Redford turns in an excellent performance, giving Muir a very hard edge and cunning mind.  Brad Pitt proves to be an effective action hero.  This is the kind of role in which Pitt shines, playing the dark, rebellious character that lives by his own code and gives in to no one.  Catherine McCormack also delivers a credible performance as the humanitarian aid worker playing both sides of the street to get supplies for the disadvantaged. <br />Action lovers will enjoy this film as will those who like a mentally challenging story.  Irated it 8/10.
0805053883|4.0|I got this for my daughter when she was 5 months old after seeing how much she enjoyed \\"Brown Bear.\\"  This book has the same appeal of the big animal pictures although the wording doesn't flow as easily.  She still loves it at a year and we often just flip through it and she tries to repeat the animal names after me.  I swear her first word was \\"elephant\\" although my friends think I'm nuts.  I think this is a great addition to any baby's library.
0380778556|5.0|The fact that we never find out (or I never noticed) the protagonist's first name bothered me slightly, but the book is so good that I was able to get over that. This book is wonderful . . . if you're going to read something labeled a classic, pick up Rebecca.
0805047905|5.0|My daughter got this when she was 4 months old and it is still her favorite at a year.  The bright pictures made her excited each time I turned the page, which she can do on her own now.  The sing-song story is appealing too.  Sometimes we just flip through the book and she tries to repeat the animal names after me.  I think this is a must-have for any baby's book collection.
0316666343|3.0|I just finished reading the book and I can honestly say that everything that took place in the book was realistic.  How the tragic event took place, the investigation, and the trials and tribulations of the family made the story more tangible and true-to-life.  I also connected with Susie and her thoughts--I would be thinking the same way and hope that I can follow my loved ones (as closely) when my time has come.  Finally, the subject is fresh from the headlines which makes the story come alive and even more practical.<BR>   <BR>    However, the story moved a little too slow.  I wanted more suspense (more umph) when it came to the investigation and sometimes the author appeared rambling over the same subjects.  The switch from heaven and earth was interesting but the switch from past to present was confusing at times.<BR>   <BR>   This book is a one-time-reader but a great example of first-person narrative and (if curious) the concept of life and death is clearly explored here.
B0000683DH|5.0|The commentary by Nick Myer said it all.  After getting Shatner to do several takes he'd be so tired out he'd read his lines naturally instead of like a leading man.  Cary Grant he ain't!<br />I love this film because it has all the elements of classic Star Trek. No other movie has ever duplicated the issues of growing old, dealing with death and life...it will be on American Movie Classics if it's not already.  I don't think that any other film came so close to being perfect as this one.  Don't rent this one if you already have it on VHS or DVD....buy it now! The director's commentary alone brings a lot of insight as to how the movie was made. Nick is a very sharp director and I only wish he was directing all of the Star Trek movies.  Perhaps he could have saved Shatner's bomb Star Trek V had he directed it!
B000069HKH|5.0|I gave this album a listen today and read the lyrics, and I was just blown away. While I like rock n roll as much as the next guy, I usually don't find that pop culture has anything truly substantive to say about issues/events of great social significance. It's most often a medium that's comfortable keeping things superficial, happy and cliche. Springsteen, however, redeems rock n roll with this album. Read the lyrics of the &quot;The Rising&quot; and you'll find that the song evokes the events of September 11th artfully, emotionally, and sensitively. Unlike almost anything else, the song (along with the rest of the album) subtly leads the listener to empathize very directly with the victims, their families, and their loss -- perhaps in a way that he or she never has before. It powerfully puts faces to the numbers. With this album, rock n roll has recovered something that it perhaps briefly had in the 60s --pop art's ability to make an important social statement and touch the soul of a nation. I hope you all see in this album what I do.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I've always loved Snow White, but this remastered edition is stunning.  The sounds and colors are so rich and vibrant that even my mom (who remembers when Snow White was released in theaters) couldn't remember it being so good.  Great for the kids, but even better for those who remember the way it was before.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Say what you will about this album and this band, but I like them both.  The Strokes have already begun a revolution back towards garage based guitar rock.  ...bands like Nickleback, Limp Bizkit and Creed may have forever soured the taste of rock n roll, but hopefully bands like the strokes can bring it back to where it needs to be.  Every so often, a band is labeled as the one \\"who will save rock.\\"  It's been quite a while since Nirvana got us out of that nightmare of a hangover called \\"the eighties,\\" and ten years later, the strokes seem willing and prepared to save music.  This album may be somewhat derivative, but in rock n roll it doesn't matter if you steal, only who you steal from.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had never read any of the books before I saw this movie, so I didn't have any idea what I was in for.  Despite being written as a &quot;children's story,&quot; I was as captivated by this fantastical world as my children.  We've seen the movie countless times, and now I'm in the process of reading the books to my kids.  The extras aren't as great as I'd like, but my kids beg to go through them time after time.  Overall, I'd say this is an excellent DVD for the whole family.
B00004Z459|4.0|This cd is awsome. The lyrics are good the music is special and it combines to make some of the best nu-metal around. the reason why i gave it 4 1/2 instead of 5 is because they are overplayed way too much.<br />There other cd Reanimation is ok but not the best. But you should listen to Aaron Lewis and Chester in Krwlng its awsome.<br />There is another cd that only made a 1,000 cdzs and is very rare its called Hybrid Thoery Ep. <br />Overall this is an excellent cd.<br />Was this review helpful to you?
B000065U1N|2.0|First of all, I can't believe that the United States military would admit to making such a horrific and deadly mistake as depicted in Black Hawk Down.  If this really is based off of actual events, I'm ashamed that it was made public knowledge.  As for the movie just as a story - if you like blood and guts (literally) then this is just right for you.  If you've got a weak stomach, skip this one.  This movie gives you close-ups of severed limbs, gaping wounds, and exposed internal organs.  While the story is gripping and rather suspensful (how are they going to get out of this mess?), it doesn't answer the question of how and why the mission was allowed to happen the way it did.
B000068TPN|5.0|I love war movies, It has action and is intense but I also like it because it shows the womans side and how effects her and how they stay strong in times of war. Mel Gibson is the perfect actor for this movie. I like how it shows that he is a father to his childern and his men. So all in all I loved this movie and recomend it to anyone who loves war films. I also recomend black hawk down.
0060392886|5.0|What can be said about the Crue that hasn't already been said? Apparantly a whole book's worth. For fans of what REAL rock n roll is all about, this is the supreme tale of rock superstardom. Vince is a sex maniac, Nikki is a heroin addict, Mick has a disease that's plagued his entire life, and Tommy, well his heart seems to be in the right place.<br />I agree with Vince, once Nikki (the main songwriter) started heroin, the albums just weren't as good (Theatre of Pain, and Girls, Girls, Girls). Yeah the hits were always there, but there was a whole lot of filler.<br />The main reason I got the book was to learn more about Mick, the Crue's mystery man. You'd be surprised. He named the band, and picked Vince to be the singer. He's done everything (to include hanging his brother). To see what he's done with his life despite his spinal problems and all, well my hat goes off to him.<br />My favorite story? There were so many. But the one I remember most was when Mick passed out on the beach when Razzle died. Mick thought he was dead himself you see. When he went back to the Motley House and saw everyone crying, he thought they were crying for him. He was convinced he was a ghost and tried to walk through the door without opening it!!!<br />Here's to you Mick, Tommy, Nikki, and Vince. Through all your craziness, ups, downs, and adventures (you gotta read about the Ozzy Tour!!!), you put out some of the greatest rock n roll the world knows.
B000002G7E|5.0|The Velvet Underground's second album White Light/White Heat was released in 1967. It was the second and final VU studio album to feature John Cale. For newcomers, it is not where to start, but for experienced VU listeners, it is a must have. There are six songs and one is a 17.27 minute epic full of distortion, fast drums, \\"ding-dongs\\", and a really loud organ. The album features songs who's topics include dark comedy, drug use, and sex. The quality of the music and lyrics are undeniable. Each members plays their part to perfection and the overall effect is one that will haunt and make you come back again and again. A suggestion: Play this album at night, when everyone is asleep, and in the dark to feel the full effect. Have fun.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is the perfect music for the end of a stressful day. It evokes a mood of cocktails on the beach at sunset! Her voice is simply gorgeous, and her musical style &amp; phrasing is beyond her years.  Don't know where she came from, but I can't wait to see what she puts out next!  Destined to become a classic.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is an awesome cd!  This is one of the best bands of today.  I really like it how there are alot of people that compare these guys to all the other bands.  You are all ... that do so.  Anyone that says these guys don't have talent I suggest you learn to play the guitar, learn their songs, and than you can tell me that it's not talent while lying through your teeth.  <br />This album shows true talent, great lyrics (unless you have a problem with personal stories), sweet ol' riffs, and perfect for anyone that loves nice solid hard rock.  It won't do for all you pop lovers and techno [people].<br />This is only an album for someone that appreciates hard rock.  Who cares about everyone that trashes this album, look at their reviews.  Especially if they are reviewing a different style of music.<br />This cd is worth it.
0316666343|5.0|I can't believe this is Alice Sebold's debut novel!  She has a remarkable knack for capturing the subtleties of life like no other author I've read.  It is at once incredibly hearbreaking, riveting, uplifting, and joyous.  Buy this book TODAY!
B000065U1N|1.0|Black Hawk Down is probably the worst war movie I've ever seen, and its faults go beyond the bad acting, repulsive gore, insipid characters, pathetic storyline (all of which there's plenty of... in fact, I didn't fall alseep only because of the unsufferable noise and repellent depiction of violence).<br />Black Hawk Down is, more than anything else, a mindless propaganda movie, which presents only one side of a war a hits us on the head with its laughable \\"message\\". It's the kind of movie that only a previous pseudo-liberal-now-all-the-way-conservative could make: a movie where the civilized troops of the US (but that could well be the \\"Western World\\") kill thousands to \\"bring good\\", and we're left crying with loud music for the 19 (contrasted to \\"more than 1,000\\") US soldiers lost. There's no discussion about morality in war and murder, it's all simply seen as \\"an act of heroism\\" and \\"doing good\\". And mind you, this does not come from somebody who wants to simply condemn war as a futile act of madness: there has been plenty of good or great war films where the most important part was the debate on where morality stops and where madness begins, the masterpiece Apocalypse Now being probably the most important; speaking of Apocalypse Now, there's another thing that was just fell flat on its face in Black Hawk Down: the music. Where in the former the mixture of rock 'n' roll fit perfectly, in Black Hawk Down it's just a mix of bad 90s pop/rock that, devoid of the atmospheric connection with the scenes, just feels awful...
B000005HN6|2.0|Let me start by saying that the musicianship on this disc is excellent.  However, what I received was not at all what I expected.  This album is 85% classical music and 15% metal.  The reviews built this CD up to be a metal masterpiece.  I personally felt that too much attention was paid on attempting an orchestral piece.  To say the least, this approach by Opeth bored me with the whole album.  I love both classical music and metal music, but I think the two styles are mutually exclusive, unlike what Dan Swano and Opeth were envisioning.  I have two later albums by Opeth, and they are a tad bit heavier, but not enough to warrant extreme music classification.  I loved Dan Swano's work, particularly with Edge of Sanity.  That is one reason that his production surprised me on these records.  I also love a little bit of classical influence in death metal (i.e.: intros and song interludes), but Opeth seemed to blast classical to the forefront of every disc they made, concealing metal a bit too much in the background.  I'm not saying this is a horrible CD.  I rated this album low because I don't agree with what audience it was marketed to.  If one is into classical music and doom metal, this CD is for them.  If one is looking for a truly melodic death metal disc like Soilwork, Gardenian, or In Flames; I'd steer clear of this slower, doom metal LP.

0312265859|3.0|I was extremely disappointed in this book, but I have been a bit disappointed in the last 2 or 3 of the Stephanie Plum books. <BR>Maybe it's because after this many books, everything I thought was funny has now become routine; I thought Grandma Mazur had a very tiny role, and what there was seemed inane. I  usually anticipate the yearly release, but now will have to rethink future purchases. One disappointment was the hasty ending. Multiple pages of buildup and a quick, abrupt end that was quite a disappointment in itself.
0780627024|4.0|I was outraged to find that the end of this wonderful movie has been changed from the screen version! The entire situation of Joan Allen's character is different, and gives the film a completely different meaning in regard to her character.  Did the Bible Belt police get hold of it, or what?  If there has been a major change in the video version of a film, this should be indicated in your description. Just a simple sentence saying something like &quot;This film has been edited and the storyline changed from the screen version&quot; would have helped to warn me.  I bought TWO copies -- one to give away -- and now I'm stuck with a movie with a completely different message than the one I saw.  I am especially disappointed since there is no way for me to own the original version.  Who made this decision and what were they thinking?
B00004TJFL|2.0|Even though our masked anti-hero, Michael Myers, is in this one quite a lot, this was still boring on so many levels.  For one, no Jamie Lee Curtis, two, you don't really see his face.  I could go on forever.  Donald Pleasence wasn't very good at Dr. Loomis this time, he sounded like he was losing his voice, so I'm guessing they made him play the part while he had a cold.  And I got so sick of Michael's neice, Jamie, going nuts every time Michael is about to kill someone, and it...it was just so boring that I stopped it three times.  Take my advice folks, don't see this one.  Go for such films as Halloween:H20, Jason X, and the original A Nightmare on Elm Street.
B000065U1N|5.0|Very good, and surely captures the feel of the &quot;Fog of War&quot;. You can almost smell the gunpowder. Mr. Scott was relentless in the pace he set with this film but two facts were missed.<BR>  1, We lost 18 men there, not 19.<BR>  2, The &quot;Skinnies&quot; were much less dignified in their tactics then the movie showed.  There was a lot of shooting from behind unarmed women, for example.<br />  There are fine web pages, including a .gov memorial to these men.  Check it out for yourself.
B0000026UL|5.0|The 1980s was far from Dylan's greatest decade musically, but he made a strong statement of his continued genius and longevity with Oh Mercy.  Forget cover songs, forget famous guest musicians, forget everything but Dylan's unmatched songwriting ability, perceptive commentary on life, and unique voice.  A confidently mellow Dylan infuses the album as a whole, but, lest anyone think his rocking days are over, he cranks out two stomping tracks in Political World and Everything is Broken.  The social commentary of the artist shines through in the opening track as he laments the dehumanizing effects of materialism, politics, and life in general; these same feelings emerge in Everything is Broken, but they are presented there in the form of a list of problems characterizing and defining the broken state of the world.  I remember hearing this song used as the backdrop of some TV features (probably sports events, if I remember correctly); it was also the last new Dylan single I have heard played on the radio, which is a sad statement to make considering the wealth of great new material he has given us since this album's release.  Inevitably, one's attention is drawn most forcibly to the song Man in the Long Black Coat because it showcases the vintage musical storytelling persona of Bob Dylan.<br />The slower songs also feature some incredible new Dylan music.  Shooting Star is probably the best known of these, since it was included on Dylan's monumental MTV Unplugged album a few years later.  Ring Them Bells is a dirgelike, mournful classic, Most of the Time is a great song about continuing to live one's life after losing someone special, and Where Teardrops Fall is, in my opinion, a beautiful song that shines among the great tracks included here.  I do believe the album weakens as it nears the end, though.  What Good Am I? and What Was It You Wanted? are good but unexceptional songs, and the important theme of Disease of Conceit is easily lost amid the sounds of the album's least enjoyable music track.  However, the greatness that is Shooting Star ensures a satisfying conclusion to one of Dylan's best albums of the last two decades.'s least enjoyable music track.  However, the greatness that is Shooting Star ensures a satisfying conclusion to one of Dylan's best albums of the last two decades.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Unlike Shakespeare's tragedies and  \\"sequels\\" featuring lovers in constant battle with and succumbing to the \\"slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes\\", Serendipity is bloodless and lovers seem to live happily ever after.  The \\"fortunate accidents\\" though have been overused and the coincidences overkilled.  After all, what are the chances of a five-dollar bill and a book circling around the world and ending into each other's hands many years after?  Zero, but the point of this romantic comedy is carried so well by the actors, that we willingly believe.  Kate Beckinsale (Pearl Harbor) is a refreshing perfect fit for the role with just the right amount of sweetness, lightheartedness and comic touch.  John Cusack complements Kate and the two have just what chemistry means - perfectly balanced.
B000066744|1.0|Formula=nice music, existential nonsense, pathetic writing, irritating actors, catatonic plot development = 1900!!!!!!!!<br />If staring deeply into the eyes of ugly fat guys with bad teeth and twitchy eyes is your idea of a good time, this movie is for you. <br />Just like the Titanic, you can't wait for this ship to go down.
0792839749|5.0|This picture is just plain fun and the older i get the more i like it and discover new things about it. My favorite character is the \\"child catcher with the net.\\"  Why can't there be someone like that in real life especailly with todays kids.  But i digress.Even though i find the kids voice somewhat annoying, the sound that is on this DVD is really great. The THX 5.1 sound catches everything that was originally recorded for the highest highs to the lowest lows. The picture quality is excellent and the film is in it's Roadshow presentation with the Intermission.This film is a total JOY for all ages. And with the ever so talented Dick Van Dyke you simply can not get any better. Sally Ann Howes is a broadway gem of a star as well as the entire cast and somehow you get a found appreciation for Benny Hill who is really totally out of character in this movie. He's wonderful.  This film is a classic and if you a bit down or sad, put this movie on for a great uplifting feeling.
B00005N5RM|4.0|This is a great &quot;drive-in&quot; style film, similar to the original except that the special effects are much better. Its well worth a look.
6302098440|2.0|This is one of the funniest films I have seen in...well...it's not really that funny, but it's something good to watch when you have nothing to do one afternoon especially if you're one of those people who are too lazy to change the channel and have no life.  Especially if you're a filmmaker, it's good for your self-esteem.  It's one of those movies that are good at two in the morning when everything is funny especially the tasteless hair styles and corney acting.  Perfect movie for aspiring actors who want to know what not to have on their resume.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I was terribly disappointed in this movie....yes the Special effects were good...even amazing at times...but the director has taken so much creative licence with this movie it barely resembles the original movie ...never mind the book. Perhaps he should have rewritten it himself and called it time machine revisited..Avoid this if you can  two stars..but only for the special effects...acting and storyline a big ZERO
6303430570|1.0|I, like my friends, heard by word of mouth that &quot;clerks&quot; was a good movie.  How can that be possible, did i just see the movie that they were talking about???  Unbelieveably bad acting, camera work, screenplay, and direction.  And also one of the most vulgar movies i've seen.  People invovled with this movie are a disgrace to american filmography.
B00005JKEC|4.0|Denzel Washington is refreshing in an uncharacteristically nasty role as a corrupt cop. Ethan Hawke is also good as the rookie cop that serves as the moral center for the film.<br />Those two performances aside, what you get is your basic cop drama. The ending strains credibility, but otherwise TRAINING DAY is a very watchable movie. Eva Mendes as Denzel Washington's significant other is an added bonus.
B000002BBY|4.0|Ah, the album everyone knows, with the songs everyone can sing. Oasis have proved in Definitely Maybe that they're good... here we have them taking their popularity and giving everybody what they want. But it does have faults, which I will get to shortly.<BR>   Hello... what a great opening. &quot;I got a feeling you still owe me, so wipe the s**t from your shoes.&quot; One of those usually-opens-sets songs from the Boys from Burnage here, and it's easily still the most overlooked things on the album. Then Roll With it, pure energy compressed into a decent song. And of course Wonderwall. The song everybody can play on guitar, the song we can all hum or sing... the song we've all heard more than birdsong. I don't mind it. It's a good song... but it's Oasis' most overplayed, overpraised tune.<BR>   Don't Look Back In Anger is the one I prefer over Wonderwall. A soaring chorus, Imagine's opening chords played with more oomf by Bonehead... it's beautiful. But who the Hell is Sally?<BR>   Skipping slightly, Cast No Shadow is one of the deepest, most touching songs Oasis have done. How it sits there so overlooked confounds me. And followed with She's Electric, wonderful singalong fun in Digsy's Dinner vein. I dare say it's better, with it's bouncier, more cheerful tune. Both are favourites of mine, even if the band regard them as folly.<BR>   Morning Glory... Oasis go for all out rock and succeed. Seems like a more powerful Roll With It, though I wouldn't dare say either was better or worse. I love them both. And, of course, perhaps the album's crowning achievement, Champagne Supernova. Liam in rare quiet, reflective mode - and a true lighter-waving chorus. This is the last of the real Oasis anthems... something everybody knows, and you're likely to be humming to yourself for quite some time.<BR>   BUT, the album has drawbacks. Hey Now seems entirely undriven and uninspired, and feels like such a letdown after the powerhouse Don't Look Back In Anger. Some Might Say, Oasis' first number 1... but I can't think why, as the song has very little that's special about it, and is completely blown out of the water by Cast No Shadow. And then, my real problem. The two quiet, muffled bursts of the Swamp Song. Now I LIKE the Swamp Song. I heard it and fell in love with it when I got the Masterplan. But why two muffled clips? Why waste a potential slot that could have housed any decent B-side? Imagine it, the album armed with Round Are Way or Talk Tonight. Ignoring Hey Now, it would have been fantastic. But no, oppertunity wasted, listener confused and eager to know what that guitar/harmonica cross really is. Guess they'll have to get The Masterplan.<BR>   So all in all, this is good... it houses some of Oasis' best moments. But it still could have been more. Some of it is so wasted, so not-quite-brilliant. It just feels like we're cheated.<BR>   Oh well, I give it the benefit of the doubt anyway. After all, it houses Roll With It, Don't Look Back In Anger, Cast No Shadow, She's Electric, Morning Glory and Champagne Supernova. All favourites of me. So for the sake of them, four stars. But still, no patch on Definitely Maybe.
B000002L9J|5.0|This is rightly considered The Smiths best album, and a masterpiece. The Queen Is Dead is one of the greatest angst albums of all-time. Morrissey, now firmly established as one of rock's finest lyricists, had developed on the first two Smiths albums (as well as on a full slate of singles) a unique and fresh lyrical perspective, always delivered in his own, intimitable way. However, by the time of this album, he had truly come into his own, and delivered not only his usual bleak, depressing and perhaps self-pitying lyrics, but also a series of devastating satires on English society - the aristocracy, the monarchy, mores, and religion. Rarely relying on mere typical verses and choruses, Morrissey here developed his own free-form lyrical approach that is forcefully demonstrated in the title track, a blistering satrical piece that is every bit as schating as the title promises - and even includes that rare thing for Morrissey, a bit of self-deprecation. The album includes several other finely wrought and sharply witty stabs at British society: Cemetery Gates (in which Morrissey namedrops Oscar Wilde, a man who obviously had immense influence on him in more ways than one); Bigmouth Strikes Again (another bit of self-deprecation); The Boy With The Thorn In His Side (a song that wasn't Morrissey's first, and wouldn't be his last, to embrace homoeroticism); and Vicar In A Tuto (a devastating satrical look at religion.) For all the album's lyrical strengths, however, The Smiths best work was always a product of Morrissey's self-indulgent lyrics and Johnny Marr's brilliant, vastly underrated musical roadmaps (a brilliant example of the greatness which can spring from working at cross purposes - which is the reason why Morrissey's solo albums aren't as good as his work with The Smiths, although his writing may well be just as good.) These musical backgrounds provide a rich tapestry for Morrissey to croon over. Marr was brilliant at supplying gentle, sing-song melodies to accompany Morrissey's dark lyrics. This juxtaposition is what made The Smiths so unique, and their work so influential. From their masterwork (the title track), with its classic end-song jam, to the brilliant pop songs that they made out of Cemetery Gates and The Boy With The Thorn In His Side, The Smiths have here clearly delivered a musical and lyrical masterpiece. One of the hallmarks of English rock.
B000002C25|2.0|Picture it. Your first album knocked everyone off their feet. Your second album propelled you to superstardom, and before you knew it the country was swaying drunkenly to your music. I suppose anyone would get ahead of themselves. And Oasis, with this third, somewhat regretted album from the Boys from Burnage, did.<BR>   On the plus side, each song isn't bad on it's own. I could easily listen to My Big Mouth on it's tod, or Fade In/Out singled out. But in succession, these laughably overlong wannabe-epics feel ludicrous and out of place. <BR>   The thing about epics is that they should be on their own, after a succession of sweeter, shorter songs. I mean Champagne Supernova sat at the end of ...Morning Glory, proving the perfect, calm yet dizzying end to an almost stupidly popular album. But an album of Champagne Supernovas would just be silly... and here it is.<BR>   When it's good, however, it's very good. D'You Know What I Mean is fantastic... perhaps the album's second only song that probably deserves it's length. It's like a slower, slightly downbeat Morning Glory. The other is All Around the World. Yeah I know, 9 minutes is a joke... but it's uplifting. Like the album, only it rarely lulls and ends with a beautiful coda that I personally prefer to Hey Jude.<BR>   One odd thing is that the singles are good, but the rest feels like filler. Although I consider The Girl In The Dirty Shirt and Fade In/Out excellent, in comparison to the powerful Don't Go Away and cheery Stand By Me, they look like jumped up B-sides. So the album comes to seem like a collection of rather substandard songs stretched to stupid length. And Magic Pie comes as the token-song-I-hate. For ...Morning Glory it was Hey Now. Here it's Magic Pie. Long, dull, no discernable message... it's just Noel rambling, knowing what he's talking about and not caring if we're clueless. Even so, it's Liam's favourite of the album. I guess it just bores me.<BR>   There's still quality here. The title track isgood, and It's Getting' Better (Man!!) is wonderfully fresh after All Around the World. But the album desperately needs to have been more sensible, more contained. Oasis need to remember that although good, and now infamous, they're not Gods. And that no-one short of some infinitely patient monk living in a mountain would have patience to sit through 70 minutes of overblown B-Side-esque material. Easily their weakest album.
B000001GAM|1.0|A legendary recording taken live in 1989. Some things cannot be planned, they just happen by accident or by the grace of some god. If you love Bruckner, or music, or have a heart and a soul, it is incumbent upon you to listen to it.<br />The 1 star is the 6th missing one. (You didn't really think I would give it 1 star, did you?)
B000068QY7|3.0|Over the years, Oasis have darted back and forth like a hyperactive marathon runner. They were great in Definitely Maybe, confident in ...Morning Glory, over-confident and daft in Be Here Now, raw and real in The Masterplan, and tired and confused in Standing on the Shoulder. Any band with less patience would have given up by now. It's probably what drove Bonehead and Guigsy out... the plot, it seemed, was starting to get lost.<BR>   There again, Gem and Andy are there now, writing songs themselves, to make up for the lyrical deficiencies Noel showed in SOTSOG. And Liam's writing too, spreading his wings (no pun intended) with Songbird, Born On A Different Cloud and Better Man. <BR>   The first thing you'll notice is, they don't sound like they used to. Liam's voice seems different, fresher somehow, energetic like it was in the beginning. The Hindu Times gets things off to a great start - an arguably substance-less song, which served the sole purpose of screaming that Oasis were back. And as a warning to everyone else to get out of the way, it worked. It took repeated listens to be anything more than forgettable to me, but now I love it. Especially the chorus. <BR>   Hung In A Bad Place is Gem's first effort for the band. It feels like another warm-up song, not much to it really. And at first I thought it was a sped up Force Of Nature. Still, it has a decent rock-y tune to offer.<BR>   Stop Crying Your Heart Out is the arguable one. I think it's a beautiful, uplifting sort of ballad, like Don't Look Back In Anger. Odd that Liam sang it, but having heard the Noel demo, perhaps he hits the words home a little more. It may be a little dull, but whenever that chorus comes out, hearts melt. <BR>   Then Songbird. I was itching to see if Liam's writing had improved from Little James - and I didn't even mind that. And they have. Songbird is a fantastic little ditty, light and tuneful. Liam can write, and that's that.<BR>   Little By Little is, like Force of Nature, about Meg Matthews - she who Wonderwall was dedicated to. Noel's angry, and complaining and bitching at her like nobody's business. Suppose you can't blame him, but devoting two songs to it? Pity. Force Of Nature I ommited earlier because it's the token song-I-hate. Slow, not particularly powerful. Boring. Little By Little is at least upliftingly bitchy, and it seems it'll end up with single status.<BR>   A Quick Peep is just that. Oasis aren't going to reproduce the Swamp Song, so why try... hence this brief, Andy Bell-penned little ditty. It's different, short enough and sweet. Bit like the album as a whole.<BR>   All In The Mind is more Who Feels Love type weirdness, barely sounds like Oasis, and Liam's voice is at it's oddest on the album. Still, I like it. It's another light little oddity, and it doesn't try to be more. She Is Love is somewhat criticised, but I love it... a jangly, irresistible little number devoted to Noel's newest bird. It's great.<BR>   Born On A Different Cloud, Liam writing in surprisingly mature ways, is perhaps trying to ape Gas Panic. It's quite haunting, quite harrowing, with a nice little \\"laa laa laa\\" bit at the end. I like it, even if it seems a touch out of place on the otherwise upbeat album.<BR>   Better Man is fantastic. A great tune, up there with the Oasis greats. Liam writing sarcasm and promises of self-improvement. Gotta' love it. It feels like Hindu Times with more meaning.<BR>   So. Heathen Chemistry. At times it's a little too new and light, but I guess that's how Oasis will play it from here on in. But the album could do with less All In The Mind curiosity, and a bit more Better Man-like memorable tunes. It's good, I like it. It's a bit of a shock to the system for anyone expecting rock-like tunes or Liam snarling like he did in the good old days. But he's got a new perspective, the band's got new people, the lyrics are getting fresher. The band were changing in SOTSOG, and here's the product. It'll take time to mature, perfectand so on. But what we have here remains classy, sufficiently memorable and, as Noel himself said, \\"More Oasis-like.\\" Don't abandon it so easily, and ignore the critics. If the future of Oasis is anything like Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out and Better Man... then they just might be great again.
B000066NW0|5.0|(Sorry for my misplaced southern accent; I am not southern, and the accent comes from daily usage.)  This is one CD I first checked out Amazon.com reviews before I bought it.  After all, being a country/rock fan, I didn't want to wind up with a Brittany Spears clone.  I had seen and heard \\"Complicated\\" (who hasn't?), but still...<br />Well, thanks.  This is one of the best buys I've made in a long time.  You guys really know what you're talking about.<br />Now for you that hasn't yet bought the CD.<br />Avril Lavigne is a multi-talented young lady only a couple years older than myself.  She manages to bring you some great music, some thoughtful lyrics, and some catchy choruses, without painting herself into one specific corner of the music genre.  Some of her songs drift into pop, some (most) into rock, some into blues, and even a couple manage to immitate country.  If you do not like one of these mentioned genres (why are you here?) do not dispare; only a handful of these songs can be classified under one name.<br />Okay, so a brief summary...heartbreak prevails, as it does on many, many albums.  Of course, there're the finding the person you love (\\"Naked\\"), having trouble understanding the person you love (\\"Complicated\\"), not sure of the person you love (\\"I'm With You\\"), telling the story of the person you love (\\"Sk8er Boi\\"), and something that has nothing to do with the person you love (the catchy and album peak \\"My World\\").  On \\"Unwanted,\\" Lavigne gives some of her best lyrics, while on \\"Nobody's Fool\\", she does a little rapping (as if, from reading these other reviews, you haven't heard; however, I am going to shed a new light on this--when a non-rapper raps, it's always better than when a rapper does it; take that anyway you'd like).<br />Alright, so I don't cover every song; and maybe I'm not the most likely person to review this album, me being a young male and a fan of country music.  But let me tell you this: years of listening to country has given me the talent of recognizing an up-and-coming singer/songwriter with great potential.  And, ladies and gentlement, I just put that talent to use.  Avril Lavigne promises with this CD, and she delivers.  So \\"Let Go\\" (so sorry for that one) and buy this album.given me the talent of recognizing an up-and-coming singer/songwriter with great potential.

B000069HKH|3.0|No doubt Springsteen's devoted fans (myself included) wanted this album to be a triumphant comeback.  Add the collective craving for a work of popular art to help us put 9/11 in emotional perspective, and you've got the recipe for a pre-certified &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  (Bruce should go ahead and decide where he's going to put his umpteen new Grammies.)  Since &quot;The Rising&quot; isn't terrible, the praise is more forgivable.  There are a handful of truly fine songs here; Springsteen's muse may be rusty, but it's alive.  And Brendan O'Brien's production opens up the sound of the E Street Band impressively.  Overall, however, the album functions best as a worthy reminder of the Boss' glory days.
B000001FKY|4.0|Although it's just a tad bit overproduced and doesn't rock as hard as Def Leppard's first three albums, it's still a great sonic experiment and an engaging listen from start to finish. The one song that I don't particularly care for is the sappy title track. One is led to believe that the record company made the band put that song on there so that more girls would buy the album.<br />All in all, this album doesn't even come close to being worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Dark Side of the Moon or Sergeant Pepper, but it was definitely one of the musical highlights of a decade that didn't have too many of them.
0425105709|5.0|I enjoyed this book which i read in a day of travel - certainly made time go by unnoticed !!<br />The story begins with the 'murder' of the dentist of Hercule Poirot (soon after Poirot visits him), with apparently no motive whatsoever. Apparent motive soon arrives in form of 'suicide' to avoid loss of face after professional bungling.<br />Poirot undertakes to find out the truth. Pretty soon, posible motives and suspects begins piling up, and it all gets very complicated.<br />Unlike most of Agatha Christie's stories, this could've had several possible conclusions, even if 'read backwards' - which means the ending, though easy to guess, is almost impossible to deduce.<br />This means that the (highly interesting) journey through the book doesn't have a very satisfying conclusion.<br />However, it's very well written and i read it in no time at all - recommended !!
6304539258|1.0|It's too bad that George Lucas makes Episode IV so precious.  It has taken him to release this movie on DVD so long that many wouldbe/couldbe fans have begun to lose interest.  There are other more recent films which compete to establish themselves in the psyche of the public (Lord of the Rings to name a recent example).  Many kids and young adults weren't even around with the original Star Wars was released and don't know what the hype is all about and frankly many of them don't care.  At this point, the longer George Lucas holds out, the more he is liable to lose money in sales.  After all, despite what he says...it really is all about money.
0425098532|4.0|This book's quite well written, but i could guess the ending much earlier than the last few pages, so i can't really give it five stars.<br />The story : Elinor Carlisle is accused of poisoning Mary Gerrard, with the case against her apparently watertight. But Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective, is not at all convinced. He undertakes the commission of finding out the truth, as opposed to defending Elinor ..........<br />What's unusual about this as a Hercule Poirot story is that he doesn't dominate the book, and other characters have equally big roles to play. He's more like the 'usual' detective in that he comes every now and then to make inquiries - but of course in his powers of reasoning and analysis he's far from 'usual'.<br />The various characters are well-etched, and the mystery unfolds nicely. However, it's possible for even the slightly alert reader to guess the ending well in advance, which to me is a drawback in this sort of a book.<br />All in all, a very well written murder mystery, well worth a read - but Agatha Christie (even if not many others!) has done better.
B000001E3L|5.0|This album is probably the next best thing to actually chatting with Van over a pint. Every Van fan should own it, and every good music fan would probably enjoy it. 'Vanlose Stairway' never ceases to amaze me, 'You Send Me' still gives me chills, and the late great John Lee Hooker's appearance on the finale completes the deal; this album is timeless. <BR>And when you settle down for the evening, play 'In the Garden'. To me, it's still one of the most beautiful songs ever.
B000056VIY|1.0|You really don't realize how weak her voice is until you listen to her lesser known songs. Obviously she uses like 10 background singers to hide her voice somewhere in between but it becomes way too ridiculous when she TRIES to sing ballads! Yes you read it right, ballads. Apparently Miss Diva thinks her voice suits ballads as well. Well, let me tell u something Jelly: YOU ARE NOT, AND I REPEAT, YOU ARE NOT MARIAH CAREY! Get over it. Needless to say her latest \\"ballad\\" never got any airplay. <BR>That's it, save your money, don't spend it on a Jello CD. You'll thank me later. <BR>Oh and by the way, in case you didn't know, track no.2 \\"Im Real\\" was the one she stole from Mariah Carey. So stop stealing songs from other (talented) artists. Geez...
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah has truly shown through in Butterfly.  Her previous albums have never displayed so much diversity as in Butterfly.  She explores losing love, being in love, memories of romance, childhood scars and feeling on the outside.  Mariah's voice has always sounded superb; on Butterfly, however, you can truly feel her emotions.  Honey the first single of the CD gleams with R and B glitz and sultry lyrics (\\"I can hardly wait for another taste of honey...\\").  What most people don't realize is that every song but her cover of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" was written by Mariah--making the lyrics extra personal.  Mariah has truly come into her own on this album--THE BEST CD OF THE 1990s.  We can only hope that Mariah's upcoming CD (December 10, 2002) revives this soul diva and since I KNOW she is capable of releasing EXCELLENT material....I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WILL BE BACK!!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Progression is indeed the name of the game people. I personally dislike any band that can't put something out new that isn't as challenging as their former. From reading some of the reviews it does seem challenging to some people and that should be a good thing not a bad one.  Likewise when a band puts out an album in the name of progression and they really don't know what their doing (Kid A) I find it repulsive and embarressing to them and to me as a fan.     \\"Yoshimi\\" is a progression.  They are always in control of their electronics never losing touch with the songs using them primarily to accent their sound, unlike the Kid A project.  Yes there are moments where they are suddenly put into the limelight, but I see this primarily as just music variations and experimentations like any open-minded indie rocker would've done.  The melodies are extremely catchy making one feel as if they've jumped in with the umpalumpa's to sing a joyous ditty. It's different yet still very cohesive from start to finish which is sometimes hard to pull off and I praise them for it!  People change is good. That is the indie way!
B000002GAF|5.0|My first taste of Gino Vannelli was the top 40 minor hit Powerful People which was on a lot of jukeboxes in the mid-70s, but it wasn't until Brother To Brother was issued that Vannelli really came to my attention.<BR>This is one of those albums that every artist hopes to make, virtually flawless from beginning to end. Brother to Brother didn't hit me at once, I Just Wanna Stop was the song that received the most airplay as it fit in commercially with the kind of stuff that was being played on the radio at that time and was a song I didn't really care for. But you could hear the promise of Vannelli's music in the song; its tightness, its harmonies, and its positive vibes. So I bought Brother to Brother on vinyl and liked it more every time I played it.<BR>My vinyl is in mothballs and I have been building a CD collection both of new music and the best of what I have on LP, so I recently purchased Brother To Brother on CD. Wow!! Its every bit as powerful and enjoyable now as when I first heard it. The music is uplifting, romantic, and soulful. With the exception of I Just Wanna Stop (which STILL sounds commercial), every song is a gem. Brother To Brother is a tour de force which belongs in every collection.
0451169514|5.0|Clearly put, IT is my favourite book. And I've read a lot of horror. King's story about a group of outcast kids who are forced to face an evil supernatural shape-shifter surpasses all. It skips between the characters as kid and as grown-ups, having to face the horror buried in their childhood. Beyond doubt the childhood storyline is much more powerful and better than the grown-up. There are points that could need some polishing, but the things it does good it does with so tremendous success and brilliance the book stays long in memory after the last page is read.
B00001U03Q|5.0|A better name for this album would have been \\"Eric Clapton: The Latter Days.\\" You will find more of a pop-rock sound than Clapton's typical blues-rock on The Clapton Chronicles, but that isn't all that bad. You will still get \\"Layla,\\" perhaps Clapton's most popular song, \\"Before You Accuse Me (Take A Look At Yourself),\\" and \\"Tears In Heaven.\\" \\"Blue Eyes Blue,\\" which was written for Runaway Bride, and \\"Get Lost,\\" are the new songs. \\"It's In the Way That You Use It,\\" \\"Forever Man,\\" and \\"Change the World,\\" are my favorites, even though they have a new sound to Clapton's music. This isn't what your looking for if you want a greatest hits album, but still a great all around collection in many ways.
B000001GXJ|5.0|Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!<BR>This word sums up everything that can be said for this recording. Here we have one of the best (the other in my opinion Santini's with Gobbi) recordings of this neglected Verdi's masterpiece.<BR>It is true that &quot;Simon&quot; is one of the most underrated Verdi operas and there are many reasons. The tenor and soprano parts are not enormous and there are many baritones and basses in the first roles. It is true that this is (as it has been called) an opera for the low voices. But oh boy! What music! When you hear it you absolutely love it. Maybe the plot is too confusing and sometimes it bores the listener but the music compensates at every bit.<BR>In this recording we have in the title role Pierro Cappuccilli, a baritone not quite famous for his acting skills but with a majestic voice. Here he acts too. Maybe due to Abbado's training. He gives shades to his voice and we can hear his anger, pity, compassion, remorse! Just listen to his performance of the last act and you will get the meaning. Many have said (and I agree) that this is his finest performance on disc. (Another great,and maybe surpassing Cappuccilli on some acting aspects, is Tito Gobbi's).<BR>Cappuccilli is accompanied here by many truly great singers. Mirella Freni and Jose Carreras give riveting performances and their voices blend very very well together. Ghiaurov as always is magnificent and his huge bass voice captivates the ear from the beginning (as does Boris Christoff on the Santini set) and the rest (most notably Jose van Dam and Foiani) give very good performances.<BR>Abbado (as in every Verdi recording he conducts) is in his territory. Correct tempi and very nice conducting.<BR>All in all, a wonderful recording of a neglected opera and a must for every Verdi fan!!
0792845730|5.0|I saw this show at a theatre when it first came out.  This is one of the most cold, unfeeling, heartless movies I've ever seen.  So why am I giving it a \\"5\\"?  If you become desensitized (like I did) to this violent, uncaring world of the future set in Detroit where arch criminals get away with murder you start to enjoy (?) this show.  What I think I mean is that for the type of show it is (quasi-science fiction) it rates as excellent.  You've got the outlaw gang run by the ruthless Clarence Boddicker, who's criminal record reads like a who's who of cop killers.  Then there's the policeman Murphy (\\"Are you a good cop, hot shot?\\") who gets killed by Boddicker's gang early in the show and thanks to OCP (Omni Consumer Products) is transformed into RoboCop, the nearly indestructible cop who's going to \\"clean up old Detroit\\".  So there's your premise.  Murphy's skills are put to the test and criminals beware (\\"there's a new guy in town\\").  Of course, it's business as usual for Boddicker's gang.  They've got \\"protection\\", the vice president of OCP, Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) calls the shots for Boddicker and destroying Robo is one of them.  Plenty of action and some extreme violence but the story keeps you captivated and if you like happy endings, well, I'll leave that for you to decide.

0743455967|4.0|I use this book as the first reading assignment in my university composition classes, and my students always react very positively to it although I do forewarn them about some of King's profane language, even though many of them use the same language in private conversations.  Our classroom discussions are lively, humorous, and thought-provoking, for most of my students are amazed that reading and writing can be rewarding.  Most, I am sorry to say, were able to graduate from public schools-in every socioeconomic neighbor-without being required to read more than one or two books during their twelve-year tenure, nor were they usually required to write more than 500 words on any given assignment.  King's book provides these novice readers and writers universal truths about writing, but because the information is coming from a published and popular writer, they absorb and accept those truths: good writing requires reading, reading, and more reading combined with writing, writing, and more writing.  Stephen King's book makes the rest of my semester so much easier, for when I discuss revisions and other steps in the writing process, my students understand and accept the value of each.  Thank you, Stephen King.
B00005JK8K|4.0|The war scenes in the movie are very real and effective (at times, repulsive). The sentimental relationship between the two main characters Joe Enders and Yahzee is well depicted. The only weak point in the movie is that neither the remaining characters nor the Navajo codebreaking are sufficiently emphasized. If you took Enders and Yahzee out, the film would look like a good documentary.<BR>Nicolas Cage is once more very good in the role of an unhappy man who has nothing left to expect from life. The film is advisable even to those who don't like war films, just for the wonderful acting of him.
0064400018|5.0|I recently read \\"Little House in the Big Woods\\" to my daughter, just as my mother had read it to me.  I loved it as a child and she loves it just as much.  I had just read her \\"Dear Hope ... Love Grandma\\" (Huwwitz and Wasburn) about a Jewish family and I was struck by how similar many of the values of the two families were.  They couldn't be more different, in time, place, religion, and yet their values of love of family, love of God, humor, warmth, kindess sustained them through hard times in just the same way.<br />These are the kinds of books our children should be reading, books that affirm life and family and all that's good in the world. Pick up \\"Little House in the Big Woods\\" and read it again.<br />I hope \\"Little House in the Big Woods\\" is still around for my daughter to read to her daughter, and so the cycle will continue.  Good books are good books.  Don't be seduced by what's new and neglect what is deservedly a classic.

I disagree with the readers who claimed to be disappointed after reading The Lovely bones because it did not live up to their media fed expectations or those more cynical readers who couldn't immerse themselves in the world of Susie Salmon.

B000053V7Q|5.0|Elvis proved to me 5 or 6 years ago he was the best, most sensational popular singing artist that ever lived. This is the reason why he is King. These performances can not be bettered by anybody, ever. I know this is saying a lot, but it's the truth. <BR>There are 3 things that made Elvis The King from a musical and visual point-of-view: his 50s TV performances, his '68 special<BR>and this movie, the most dynamic performance one -very human- man can possibly give. I mean, he knocked himself out night after night and reclaimed his throne. Elvis was Back. Again.<br />I have over 1000 CDs, blues-hard rock, jazz, soul, funk, you name it, and although he almost destroyed his carreer in the 60s by many bad movies, here he not only proves to the world who's King in the popular music field, but knocks you out by his charisma, energy, talent and sex appeal and makes your girlfriend wonder what the heck she's doing with a guy like you...

B000002H97|3.0|Ok, I am a bigger fan of the old Metallica. My opinion is Master of Puppets is their best work. This album is still a great album; still heavier than hell and at times fast. The songs are relatively shorter and the focus is on getting mainstream. The only big downpoint is it's cause. <br />The good points:<BR>Musically, it's pretty good. It's your basic Metallica heaviness and speed. James' vocals have improved:  he can pull off his trademark growl and a soft singing voice as well. There are great riffs, especially in &quot;Sad But True&quot; and &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;. Jason does well on his bass, actually showing up this time. It's too bad he was basically shunned out throughout his 14+ years. Some of the lyrics are pretty good too. <br />The bad points:<BR>There's not much creativity to this album. There seems to be a lot of filler to it, hence the 12 songs. There's no particular theme, other than the new change of direction. The songs are overall, too short, they're missing their Metallica essence. Jason only contributes to one song, and this guy has real talent. Kirk's solos are slow and boring compared to what he's capable of. Lars' drumming isn't too exciting. The other half of James' lyrics seem like he wasn't trying too hard. The album isn't really something you'd want to listen to for fun all the time. It's more like you'd put it on for a party or on the radio. The songs lack structure of usual Metallica effort. I think Bob Rock the producer did more harm than good. Now he's temporarily in the band! <br />Overall, it's and OK album to listen to. Despite it's tendancy to get repetative and boring, the good songs are great to bang too. As a metal album, it gets 5 stars, but for a high-standard Metallica album, it gets 3.
B0000029GA|5.0|Simply put, this album is everything that hip-hop should be.  Expertly produced by some of the greatest minds in the game (Pete Rock, DJ Premier, and Large Professor to name a few) and matched up with some of the greatest lyricism rap has ever seen, Illmatic was revolutionary when first released in '92.  You won't find any cheesy, gimmicky skits on this album, nor will you find any superfluous guest stars or filler material.  From start to finish, an amazing experiance.
B000063K2W|5.0|I am writing this review after recently watching a revival of the play on PBS.  Not having seen the movie in many years, I ordered it on DVD afterward.  First, the DVD transfer is flawless.  This film is mostly in black-and-white, save an insert in Technicolor for a fashion show.  The range of gray tones in these old movies can be a revelation to those who have only seen recent B/W films.  The masters of the studios in lighting these movies are long since gone, and apparently their craft went with them.  The DVD has not only the delightful movie trailer that went with \\"Women\\", but also the trailer for the musical remake in 1956, \\"The Opposite Sex\\".  I never liked the musical, but others might.<br />The amazing thing about \\"The Women\\" is that, if one doesn't pay attention to the trailer, it's possible to watch it and never realize that there are no men at all in the picture!  As the trailer says, 135 women and no men.  But of course it's all about men!<br />This is the basic story of Mary, played by Norma Shearer, who discovers her husband is seeing another women.  It follows her through her divorce and reunion with her husband.  Naturally it's not that cut-and-dried.  Her bitchy, back-biting friends go through many of the same travails on a cross-country route to a happy ending.  Sounds boring written here, but the movie definitely isn't.  Every time Ms. Shearer threatens to get too sugary, a few choice cracks by one of the other characters brings things back into line.<br />I really can't remember another movie I've seen with Norma Shearer, so this movie defines her work for me.  She is a very unusual-looking woman, hard to define as pretty, yet definitely with screen presence.  Of course, being Mrs. Thalberg didn't hurt her ability to get this part, and she plays it beautifully. All of the others who support her are equally appropriate, particularly Joan Crawford as the 'other woman'.  This movie was made in one of the low periods in her career, and once again placed her as an A-level actress.  Mary Boland also stands out as the Countess and later Mrs. Buck Winston.  In the recent PBS production on television, Rue McClanahan played this part and the resemblance to Boland was uncanny!<br />Wardrobe for the movie was provided by Adrian at his best.  Standouts for me are the gowns worn by Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer in the final scene of the movie, at the nightclub.  Ms. Shearer's looks almost like something from a sci-fi film!<br />There is no escaping that this movie, and play from which it was derived, were made pre-WW-II.  The extravagance shown in this film was never revived after the War, so this gives an insight into the lives of the wealthy.  In particular, homes post-War were never staffed with the number of servants shown here.<br />Art Deco never looked better in movies than it does in this one.  The beauty salon at the beginning of the movie, and the night club at the end, are creamy and curvaceous like never before, or since.<br />A final note on casting:  Marjorie Main leaps from the screen with her screeching voice and uncouth manners.  Strangely, she was younger than many of the others in the movie, but as usual she was made to appear frumpy and worn-out.  In some ways this appears to be a rehearsal for her part as Ma Kettle in \\"The Egg and I\\".  Look closely, though, and you'll see her youth, here.<br />This is a fairly long movie, well over two hours, but it is so enjoyable that the time isn't noticed.  There truly isn't a 'slow' part to the movie, something or someone is always on the go.<br />Nineteen thirty-nine was an amazing year for movies, seemingly one last pre-War gasp at screen opulence.  \\"The Women\\" on DVD can be a welcome addition to anyone's film library, waiting for the right evening when light comedy combined with beautiful women and sassy dialogue is called for.  It would be a great buy at twice the price.n placed her as an A-level actress.  Mary Boland also stands out as the Countess and later Mrs. Buck Winston.

B000002UUX|5.0|My 2nd favorite thrash record ever, only slightly behind Peace Sells which is the true master of thrash. The guitar work on this album is nothing short of brilliance. Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman are the best guitar duo there is. David Ellefson gets to show of his talent in Five Magics, Poison was the cure and Dawn Patrol. Nick Menza is one of the best drummers I have ever heard and his best work is on this album. Bassically this album is a chance to show off the brilliant musicianship Megadeth has, from shredding solos to killer riffs. From pounding bass lines to beating double bass drums, Rust in Peace stands in a class of it's own in the metal world. I only prefer Peace Sells over this because of it's dark vibe. Every song on PSBWB flows perfectly into the next. I just feel it is put together better than Rust In Peace. So if you want the best Megadeth check out Peace Sells but I assure you Rust In Peace is awesome to. Just buy any Megadeth album wheather it be this, PSBWB, SFSGSW, KIMBABIG, CTE, YOUTH, CTE, ect. VIC Rattlehead rules the world!!!!!
B00005K3OT|5.0|\\"God who made the world and everything in it...does not live in shrines...\\" Acts 17:24.<br />The small French village where Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter (Victoire Thivisol) come to live (delivered by the clever north wind) has been ruled by strict and narrow convention for a long time. The local count (Alfred Molino) is the powerful mayor who \\"helps\\" the priest write sermons critical of actions eschewing denial of the flesh. The town's unhappy people live in fear of their neighbor's censure, their god's wrath, and happiness in any form. \\"Right\\" action rules. Sunday mass in the town's cathedral is a mixture of furtive unruly behavior and external show.<br />But Vianne is a force to be reckoned with. The daughter of a French pharmacist who traveled abroad and met and married her mystical mother in Latin America, Vianne understands the magical properties of natural substances properly mixed and administered. Soon Vianne opens a shop where she concocts chocolate confections to minister to any need-physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. Chocolate--elixir for the gods and one of nature's wonders is her main ingredient, although others such as selected chili peppers play a part.<br />As if things weren't strained enough by the arrival of Vianne and her tempting sweets, the poor mayor soon encounters a \\"gang\\" of river rats who descend on his doorstep one fine day. These Irish travelers are led by Roux (Johnny Depp), a pig-tailed, charming young man who is musically gifted. Vianne and Roux soon stir up all sorts of excitement for the town's inhabitants and destroy the straight-jacket \\"tranquility\\" of the little village.<br />I waited to see CHOCOLAT until I could buy the DVD, and it was worth the wait. My granddaughters and I have watched CHOCOLAT several times. We love this film with it's fine cast of characters including the wonderful English actors Judi Dench and John Wood, as well as Leslie Caron with whom I fell in love when I was a little girl and she played LILI in the 1950s film.<br />Judi Dench is well known, and John Wood less so, but he frequently plays character actors and is very recognizable. He and Alfred Molino played parts in LADYHAWKE, where Molino was Cesar the man who hunted wolves, and Wood the wicked bishop. Rounding out the stellar crew is Lasse Hallstrom the director, who proved in MY LIFE AS A DOG and THE SHIPPING NEWS that he can elicit marvelous performances from children. Victorire Thivisol played PONETTE a few years ago and she remains a wonderful young actress.<br />CHOCOLAT is a magical film that reminds me that life is about living.e played LILI in the 1950s film.<br />Judi Dench is well known, and John Wood less so, but he frequently plays character actors and is very recognizable.

B0000640VO|5.0|This was a sweet, beautiful movie that I think everyone would enjoy - particularly those of us who have fallen in love with Paris.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album was the first album in which Metallica had a sense of direction. Kill Em' All defied who they were, Ride the Lightning proved it. This in my opinion is their second best work with only Master of Puppets beating it. <br />1. \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\"<BR>Great opening song with a great opening! The classical intro with the allmighty Cliff Burton (R.I.P.) on bass is perfect. Then all comes crashing down with an atomic riff. Great solo and awsome double bass with Lars. Lyrics are just threatening. Rating: A<br />2. \\"Ride the Lightning\\"<BR>This is a pretty good song for the title track. The opening is awsome leading into the dull riff. It has OK lyrics and riffs. The highlight would be the solo written by Megadeth's former frontman Dave Mustaine. Rating: B-<br />3. \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\"<BR>Great song. Pure Metallica. It's slower tempo is overwealmed by it's heaviness. Cliff's bass solo intro is pure genious. The lyrics are some of James's best ever written. The ending solo is OK. Rating: A<br />4. \\"Fade To Black\\"<BR>One of the best songs on this album. Their first ballad and they pulled it off like a charm. Kirk does an awsome solo and the riffs are just soul wrenching. Cliff is awsome live on the Cliff Em All DVD, just as he is here. Rating: A<br />5. \\"Trapped Under Ice\\"<BR>This is an overall OK song. Seems kind of like a filler. Good solos throughout it though. Rating: C<br />6. \\"Escape\\"<BR>This is a lot similar to Trapped Under Ice. It has good lyrics but just doesn't seem to fit the theme of death on the album. Pretty good riffs. Rating: C+<br />7. \\"Creeping Death\\"<BR>In my opinion, the best song on the album. This is one of their best songs with and awsome riff and lightning fast solos. James does great work with the lyrics this time again. The interlude is the best. \\"DIE!! DIE!! DIE!!\\" Rating: A<br />8. \\"The Call of Ktulu\\"<BR>This is the best and first Metallica instrumental with all members. Orion and Ktulu are neck and neck though. This song is one ofmy favorites. The clean intro followed by Cliff's enigmatic solo hidden in the song is awsome. The solo is great. each riff reigns in as some of the best Metallica has to offer. A thunderous song that crashes down almost 9 minutes later. Rating: A<br />Overall, this album defied Metallica. With each member, James, Lars, Kirk, and Cliff, giving the best and most creative efforts they can. This is a must own album.
B000002W8O|5.0|If you are a true fan of Elvis, & if you don't already own this classic Christmas album-get with it & ORDER IT NOW!!!  You can't go wrong with this, plus there's not a bad tune in the bunch.  Both the religious as well as the rock & pop songs are top-notch & you can tell that he really put his heart & soul into each & every song.  Every Christmas season this is one CD that stays in my stereo for a very long time.  It's one collection that you'll never tire of, trust me on this.  Very highly recommended.
0446310786|5.0|Scout and Jem Finch adore their father, Atticus. Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is asked to defend an African American man, Tom Robinson, accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the daughter of nasty Bob Ewell. Atticus must endure critisism from neighbors, townspeople, and his kid's classmates. But he doesn't care. Also, Scout and Jem are fascinated by their neighbor, Boo Radley. Boo has barely been seen, so some think he's a monster, and some think he's a criminal. Scout and Jem are determined to find out.<br />The two plots link in a stunning way, one of the things that makes this book amazing. <BR>This book is a classic. It's my FAVORITE book! It's descriptive, has a wonderful plot, has interesting plot twists, and really gets into the mind of a 7 year old girl. <BR>Thank you, Ms. Lee, for writing such an important piece of literature!
B000069HKH|4.0|from Bruce at this stage of his career. If you're hoping to hear the Springsteen of old with the passion and creativity so prevalent on his first 6 albums you will be very disappointed. If you want to hear memorable contributions from Clarence Clemons and other members of the band you will again be disappointed.  If you want to hear a pretty decent album and take bruce for what he is at this stage of his career (after over 30 years of giving it everything he had), then you will enjoy this cd. Although there are really no bad songs on this cd (remarkable for a 15 track cd), there aren't any that will blow you away either. The most compelling songs are \\"Lonesome Day\\"(nice violin touch with a powerful chord structure), \\"Into The Fire\\"(you can feel it in your heart), \\"Empty Sky\\"(Bruce conveys the isolation perfectly), \\"Worlds Apart\\"(the most creative and powerful song on the cd), \\"Let's Be Friends\\"(borderline corn but Bruce pulls it off), \\"Your Missing\\"(very moving), and \\"The Rising\\"(traditional Springsteen). The worst song is \\"Countin' On A Miracle\\"(forgettable) and \\"My City Of Ruins\\" is much better than the deplorable version from the \\"Tribute\\" cd. I gave this cd 4 and a half stars not because it was a really great cd but because it was an honest effort from Springsteen to produce quality, meaningful music rather than hacking something out and selling it on his name and I appreciate that. So if you're a Springsteen fan you should buy this cd with the appropriate expectations. If you're not a Springsteen fan already this cd probably won't turn you into one. ...
B000055Y0X|5.0|What more could I add to the list of reviews here?<br />This is a flawless movie, an ironic dark comedy that would undoubtedly appear on everyone's top 100 movies of all time list.<br />The performances of Peter Sellers as multiple characters, George C. Scott and Slim Pickens are fantastic - perhaps the best of their careers.<br />The phone call Peter Sellers has as the President with the Premier of the Soviet Union (who is apparently drunk) is an unforgettable comedic scene reminiscent of the best of the Bob Newhart &quot;phone call&quot; skits.<br />If you have never seen this movie you must.  Also check out &quot;Fail Safe&quot; with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon - an excellent, sober contemporary to Strangelove.
B000001GKC|1.0|Once more, the great imposter beguiles. Hiding behind the wonderful playing of the VPO, Karajan amply demonstrates how un-necessary he really is.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Hail to the actors and producers of this motion picture!!<br />My wife and I recently visited Tombstone, AZ. and toured the shootout site at The OK Corral which occurred on October 26, 1881. ... .<br />Based on what I read and saw, the movie is generally accurate and based on true facts. The performance of Val Kilmer as the role of Doc Holiday should have been awarded with the best supporting actor in a major role. The Academy either ignored it, or had made a prior commitment to give it to a less deserving actor.<br />The dvd has added feutures such as DTS and 5.1 digital channels. The quality of the picture is pure, crisp and as digital as it comes. In my honest opinion, this is the greatest western movie ever produced. A must in your library. Big thumbs up!!!

She is supposed to go straight home to Phillidelphia. But when Louden Trott(Griffin Dunne)is sent to  make sure she gets on the bus, it turns into one big adventure!

B00004Y6O9|5.0|A landmark recording for rock music as a whole, and a cd that every self-respecting fan of the genre should own.<br />Eddie Van Halen's guitar technique was utterly revolutionary and set the tone for the entire 1980's guitar virtuoso movement as well as influencing most every guitarist since, but when complemented by David Lee Roth's masterful showmanship, Michael Anthony's spleen rumbling bass and Alex Van Halen's powerful drums the sheer quality of musicianship resulted in a sure fire classic. Also, a relatively lengthy gestation period resulted in the band creating one of the most polished, consistent debut albums ever.<br />This is an essentially a flawless recording, from the ryhthmic stomp and melodic chorus of 'Runnin' with the devil' through to the Pseudo-thrash, punk influenced histrionics of 'On Fire'.  Sandwiched between these two songs, rock standards in themselves, are such timeless classics as the guitar masterpiece 'Eruption', the blueprint for almost every guitar solo for the next 20 years, the stunning Kinks cover 'You Really got me' or the slightly darker, rollercoater ride that is 'Ain't talkin' bout love' (both of which garnered huge media attention). All are an exhibition of the albums quality.<br />Even the less publicised tracks, such as the jaw droppingly well executed 'Im the One', the riotous 'Atomic Punk', the melodic 'Little Dreamer' or the blues standard 'Ice Cream man' which is reworked in inimitable Halen fashion are incredible.<br />In short, buy this album. The musicianship is achingly good, the consistency over every single track sustained masterfully, the lyrics by turns beautifully ironic or wonderfully uplifting. Add to this the fact that it is possibly the only album in the world that has made me laugh out loud with joy after listening to it through and my enthusiasm becomes apparent.<br />I honestly cannot recommend this record enough.
B00005NNMK|4.0|great new version of the final count down.however alot of people don't know that the 3 xtra tracks at the end of this that sound slightly more contemporary,and more intense,''especially danger on the track'',were played by kee marcello,in 1987 from the out of this world home video,at this time john was already gone writing total control.i give it 4 stars because i feel they should have added kee's guitar solo,(hammers heart)it's an instrumental ihat he used to do that from blues to metal to the flight of the bumbble bee,then breaks into metal again''actually could have replaced steve vai in crossroads''.it's good,but i thik hammers heart should be on it....4 stars
B0000636UN|1.0|I bought this album for the song, \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" and it ended up that that was the only song I would like on this album. I think most of the songs are a little stupid and poorly written. Save your money. I ended up giving the CD away because I never wanted to listen to it.
B000068QY7|5.0|Okay, I'll break down with my input.  I've been a long time Oasis fan.  From their first album all the way through this gem.  Every Oasis album or demo or live performance or boot I've ever heard has its ups and downs.  All of Oasis' previously released &quot;official&quot; CD's have had their ups and downs also.  But overall, I can say this is close to their best.  And though it's short, hey, remember the times the great supergroups of yore used to put out a new &quot;short&quot; piece of vinyl every year or 6 months?  I hope this is a renewal of sorts for Oasis and that we will see a new CD in the not too far distant future.<br />If you have ever gotten into Oasis (and it's a learning and growing process) at all, you will find some of their best work on this CD, &quot;Heathen Chemistry.&quot;  A few tracks rival previous classics like &quot;Wonderwall,&quot; &quot;Champagne Supernova,&quot; and though there is no long epic here (boo...), a listen to this on repeat mode is necessary to break all resistance.  Which is futile.  Because with this CD, there are some instant classics.  And though there are faults, they are minor.  There is no bad song on this album really, but then I don't think I've ever heard a &quot;bad&quot; Oasis song.  Just some ya like a lot better than others.<br />The best tracks IMO are, in no order, The Hindu Times, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, (Probably) All in the Mind, and Born on a Different Cloud.  These are all Oasis at their best.  Force of Nature, Hung in a Bad Place, Little by Little and Better Man are very good.  Hey, that's most of the album folks.  Buy it!  Share it.  Those rumors of Oasis' demise have been greatly exaggerated.<br />The opening track The Hindu Times has a defiant, positive drive to it, with a guitar riff that is impossible to dislike.  In Stop Crying Your Heart Out, within a sad and reflective context, there is a positive slow beat to this.  It's a beautiful song.  (Probably) All in the Mind features great backup vocals and an extended guitar solo (again, not nearly long enough), with old time fuzz.  Great stuff.  The guitar work throughout is brilliant and simple and complex at the same time.<br />If there was a &quot;best&quot; song here, I'd go with &quot;Born on a Different Cloud&quot; which uses a very simple chord progression to deliver a powerful &quot;best of the Beatles&quot; sound.  Complete with psychedelic opening, to the eerie (whether intentional or otherwise doesn't matter to me, it's a tribute at the very least), JOHN LENNON influence.  Well, it's a great song over all, and complete with handclaps, guitar work great as always, synthesized sounds and embellishments, and a short solo which sounds exactly like George Harrison.  If this had to be Oasis' last song ever on some future tribute album, great.<br />In summary, this ranks alongside all of the rest of their work, all of which I've found consistently great, innovative, easy to listen to on repeat mode, and my quibbles are few.  I do wish the CD was a lot longer, especially the great instrumental on the album, &quot;A Quick Peep,&quot; which is OH, WAY TOO QUICK at only a bit over a minute.  I could've listened to this little &quot;jam&quot; for 10 minutes or more.  Perhaps in the future, they will do such a version &quot;A Long Peep.&quot;  In many ways, &quot;A Quick Peep&quot; may signal a different direction for Oasis in the future, one more towards a progressive nature, which I think would be fantastic.  A Quick Peep sounds very much like an old Genesis song in their prime.

B000002HEP|5.0|This is an album that defines a genre, and with such a distinction one would expect nothing short of a masterwork. Astoundingly, Kyuss deliver an album here that wildly exceeds anyones expectations.<br />Kyuss are far, far more than the Black Sabbath clones that they are occasionally labelled as by some narrow minded, ignorant music fans (and critics alike).<br />Describing their sound in mere words is almost impossible. Imagine guitars that are so heavy that thay appear to be an aural wall of noise, yet often screech unexpectedly into tripped out interludes. Imagine bass so low that it is almost inaudible yet utterly essential to the overall effect (and is delivered on this release by one of the best in the business-Scott Reeder). Imagine drums often imitated yet never bettered, played in masterful style. Imagine vocals so raw and heart rending they seem supernatural, grating even, yet compelling and likeable, delivered in the inimitable style of John Garcia.<br />This is Kyuss.<br />As for the album itself: from the churning stomp of the super heavy 'Gardenia' to the melodic, catchy acoustics of 'Whitewater' it is flawless.<br />'Asteroid' is a wonderfull instrumental, searing like the desert sun in which Kyuss' members spent their youth.<br />Supa scoopy and Mighty scoop (ridiculous title admittedly) is a speedy, martial 4 minutes with a bizzare stop/start ending effectively drawing it to a mighty conclusion.<br />100 degress is a lightning fast wall of noise, while the 10 minutes+ of the lighter, acoustic 'Space Cadet' and 'Demon Cleaner' is some of the most compelling, emotive music ever created, as well as introducing some welcome diversity to the release and showcasing the bands ample musical talents.<br />Finally, 'Odyessy', 'Conan Troutman' and 'N.O' drag the album to a cataclysmic conclusion, before the mellower 'Whitewater' allows us scant time to reflect upon the genius just witnessed.<br />Even if you are not a huge stoner rock fan (im not), or even a huge metal fan, this album is well worth the purchase.<br />Hugely recommended.s album is well worth the purchase.<BR>Hugely recommended.
B000068FUS|2.0|I have to agree with Anthony from Brownsville. I am a huge Skynyrd fan and really wanted to like this album. I remember everything from those times in the 70s. Anyway, the concept is great, the lyrics are actually well done, but the songs are totally unmemorable.<br />As the Who have proven, rock operas that stand the test of time have songs that can stand on their own. Unfortunately, they aren't here.
B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives burst upon the scene like a breath of fresh country air after one has been confined to the smog-filled urban air for way too long. I don't how often you all listen to modern rock radio, in all of its way overblown post-grunge/punk-pop sound, but I know I listen often, and I feel that the Hives definetely are the rush of oxygen that the current popular music scene needs.<BR>The album itself is a punk masterpiece, taking the genre back to its roots, seemingly ripping, clawing, and practically tearing the tree itself out the ground. The best tracks are (in no particular order): Die, Alright!, Supply and Demand, Hate to Say I Told You So(widely played single), and A Get Together to Tear It Apart. Still, this is not to say that the other tracks are not great; they are, the previous are just my favorites. This band is certainly more punk than anything else current out there; and,no, being punk really has nothing to do at all with the way you dress, having piercings, or only being able to play three chords in eighth note patterns, but,rather, it is purely attitude. And the Hives have it. And I hope you soon will, too.
B00004XONN|5.0|I am familiar with all albums previous to &quot;Kid A&quot; that Radiohead has put out, and I have to say this is, by far, such a mark of growth and breadth of influence it's hard to write a review in 1000 words or less.  It's the biggest piece of musical genius to hit the music world this decade.  Radiohead is often overlooked for their genius, I believe, because it's not the modern, pop-y, song-of-the-minute music we're used to these days.  Instead, Radiohead crafts music with thought, not only to lyrics (or lack thereof, as the case may be), but song structure and texture as well; this is evidenced perfectly in &quot;How To Disapear Completely&quot;, possibly the most complex and sonically textured song Radiohead has written to date.  It hums, ebbs, flows, then warps into other soundscapes and comes back to perfect harmony again.  Genius.  They are truly musicians, even modern day composers, if you will.  On &quot;Kid A&quot; they not only delve deeper into themselves with self-criticism but also reflect on society today, as is evidenced in &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;.  This album as a whole flows better than any other to date.  Those people who put this album down aren't unintelligent, they just don't understand well-crafted, thought-provoking music when they hear it.  Pity on them.
B00006F2TV|5.0|... I think tobey Maguire is the best young actor of his generation and I'm proud his movie is a hit (8th position in the world wide box office!) and that he is finally famous because he has a great talent and few people knew him when he started his career .... , I can tell you that in France, the film has 6 000 000 of tickets sold and my best friends love him! Me, I'm one of these people who know him from  the start, from Ice Storm to Spider-Man . And I can tell  you that he hasn't changed. he's still cute and very talented. Before saying something absolutely wrong on him, he must immediately see his movies! <br />Spider Man is great! It's a masterpiece and this movie deserves to be a hit and to have lots of Awards! This movie deserves to make us see how Tobey Maguire is great and powerful!
B000068FUS|2.0|I have to agree with Anthony from Brownsville. I am a huge Skynyrd fan and really wanted to like this album. I remember everything from those times in the 70s. Anyway, the concept is great, the lyrics are actually well done, but the songs are totally unmemorable.<br />As the Who have proven, rock operas that stand the test of time have songs that can stand on their own. Unfortunately, they aren't here.
0440224764|5.0|The Partner, where should i begin, i cant describe what this book is about in 1,000 words but I'll do my best at summarizing it for you.  It is about a guy (Patrick) who steals 95 million dollars from his firm and runs for his life.  After 5 years of evading the government he is finally caught, however that is just the beginning of the book,  This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will not want to stop reading until you have finished.  It will keep you guessing from Cover to Cover.  It has so many twists and turns and if anyone could predict the ending to this book without someone telling them or reading ahead they are a genius.  It is spellbounding and is definetely worth 7 dollars.  One of Grishams best books ever, and i have read them all, If you have read all of the Grisham books you know that is saying a lot but it is true,  I hope you found this review useful.
B00000I8UF|5.0|AND I LIKE THIS ALBUM A LOT!!!! Moanin' has got to be one of the most enjoyable albums I've ever heard, in jazz or any other genre for that matter. The tracks: memorable. The playing: extraordinary. The vibe: infectious! Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers manage to knock one out of the ballpark on this Blue Note date and the remastering job done by original recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder is all the more reason to pick this one up for your collection. The title track is truly classic (just listen to the inventive solos by trumpeter Lee Morgan and pianist Bobby Timmons on the original version if you don't believe me!) Along Came Betty just swings like nobody's business and the Drum Thunder Suite might as well be the highlight of the entire album, showcasing the explosive, polyrhythmic style that has since become Blakey's calling card (check out the work he pulls off with the mallets, MINDBLOWING STUFF!).<br />As I've stated before, I don't claim to know all there is to know in the world of jazz, but I took a chance on Moanin' based on several recommendations and found it to be a legitimate keeper. Hell, you don't even have to like jazz to get into this album. GOOD MUSIC IS GOOD MUSIC, PERIOD!
6305428220|3.0|When i initially went to view this movie i wasn't expecting much as my experience with so called 'teen' movies has been uniformly grim up to now. However this has to rank as the best ive seen in this genre by some distance. Of course it suffers somewhat from the usual clichs but despite that succeeds in displaying a remarkable amount of emotional depth. Though the characters would seem to be mere stereotypes representitive of the usual high-school cliques- nerds, jocks, popular-people and loners- the talented cast succeeds in imbueing them with more than average complexity. Particularly notable in this regard is Elijah Wood, whose understated yet decidedly powerful performance stands out from the rest. He lends an startling element of humanity and depth to what might have been a very restricting role, as well as neatly landing some potentially awful lines. Among the rest Clea Duvall stands out as do the various members of the titular 'faculty'. Marred somewhat by excessive and pointless swearing (...) this is nonetheless an intelligent effort that imroves decidedly on repeated viewing.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Herbert West's medical methods might be less than ethical yet his discovery of a formula designed to 're-animate' dead body parts has been his life's work.<BR>Medical school has not treated him well but West has a determination to prove himself capable of playing God...at any cost.
B00000I924|5.0|Jeff Beck has always been my favourite guitar player.  Back in 1971, I met him in my local music shop (I was eleven at the time) and just getting into music.  He spent half an hour showing me the basics of playing guitar.<br />Thus, achieving hero status for me, I truly believe his passion for music has progressed with every new album he produces.<br />Turn on 'Who Else' and you will emerge 45 minutes later, musically, spiritually and physically refreshed. Bit like sinking into a steaming jacuzzi with a beautiful friend...You can't help but come out cleansed and refreshed. Who Says rock music cannot be culturally elevating???<br />Best track on the album is the heavy slide blues piece 'Space For Papa' - smoothly sliding into the soul soaring 'Angel'.  Oh wow,  Stick this CD in the car, turn up full volume and cruise the highways...<br />God bless you Jeff Beck!
0446677450|5.0|I found it so fascinating,I read it non-stop and ordered additional copies to give as presents to friends. The subject (Cuban missile crisis) was researched and presented by the author who was a participant antisubmarine warfare officer on a US destroyer, and later had access to classified Russian military  reports and intervied his opposition submarine commanders. The drama is unfolding on the military-diplomatic front, as well as in the lifes of many individuals serving aboard ships and submarines.
B00003CX5P|5.0|If you are a fequent patron of the &quot;DVD&quot; Easter Egg web sites, this disc will amuse and entertain.  Plus, it's the only DVD I own that has true interactivity in your computer - it has a &quot;special&quot; web site attached to it that for a while, was exclusive in content to DVD owners... a great idea by the LucasCronies.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie is a must to watch from an informational point of view. If you need to find information on tactics, uniforms, weapons,etc-this is the one. This the one,if you want to understand what this war was about. About real soldiers,who actually had to fight in Vietnam:18-19 years old kids,who were drafted and without any choice were thrown into a foreign country to play a strange game of survival : the one , who kills first, will win another chance to play this game again...and again.All we wanted was simple- just to go home ... alive. I was lucky to see my home, but many of my friends didn't.

B0000508U6|5.0|I think I only disliked one song on this album out of the whole, which is saying quite a lot given the mediocre state of affairs in music today.  Coldplay writes thought-provoking, lush music replete with emotion, candor and elegance.  On par with Radiohead, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This movie is an absolute treat to see.  Daniel Day-Lewis as Hawkeye and Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro are a believable couple and pairing them in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS was a stroke of genius. Their beautiful together!<br />Set during the French and Indian War, Hawkeye is a scout, and along with his adopted Mohican family managed to save the daughters of an important English officer.  One of the women, Cora Munro, is a strong female character and she and Hawkeye fall in love. Chingachgook is the foster father of Hawkeye and along with his son are the last people of the Mohican tribe. Magua is the other major Indian character and his traitorous deeds give the story most of the battle sequences.<br />This movie has it all, great acting, terrific music, outstanding scenery and an exciting story.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Princess Ann  (Audrey Hepburn)(by some accounts, based on Britain's Princess Margaret) is on a trade tour for her unnamed European nation.  After a highly formal and boring ball (enlivened, in a hysterical scene by the Princess removing her uncomfortable shoe and then losing the shoe!) she rails against her regimented lifestyle and is given a sleeping pill.  The half-drugged girl sneaks out of the Roman villa where she's staying, to be discovered by a reporter (Gregory Peck), who takes her home to recover.  Peck soon realizes the girl's identity, gathers a photographer with a hidden camera, and takes her out for a day of \\"enjoying herself\\", perfect for an expose with lots of candid shots.  But he soon finds himself falling for her . . .<br />  No doubt today the movie would end quite differently.  But the classic, climactic scene, as they express their never-to-be love in coded words with dozens of others present, sets this movie apart, along with the acting of Peck and Hepburn (for which she won a deserved Oscar), and the many scenes of early-Fifties Rome (watch for the great, ad-libbed scene at the Mouth of Truth), make this movie one of the greatest ever.<br />  In this era of blatant acting, Peck and Hepburn, well-directed by William Wyler, show how much can be done, and better, with a mere facial expression.<br />  You'll love it.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|A movie similar to \\"The Patriot\\" in that it takes an American War and sets against it a touching personal story, while doing its best to sanitize black spots in our history and smooth out history to make it a better plot device, at the expense of depth.  Racism is presented as merely an afterthought, and there's Cuba Gooding, Jr. playing a black Navy cook for one of two times.<br />The movie appears historically accurate to the extent that it focuses on the attack.  Minor events can and should be made fictitious so as not to focus on specific individuals the way a documentary would.  The story you see in the movie is one which could have happenend; fragments of it almost certainly happened, like the underage runaway who lies about her age to get into the Navy.  The cause of the love triangle looks like it came out of a modern soap opera, but that can be forgiven.<br />The movie has three distinct parts: before, during, and post-attack, and could almost have been broken up into three separate movies (the movie runs LONG, almost four hours).  The attack sequence is a bit unnerving for Americans who aren't used to seeing us get slaughtered, but The Patriot already covered that ground successfully.  As in The Patriot, the Japanese perspective is given a voice, including one brief scene of a young Japanese soldier writting a love letter in which he speaks of the willingness to die for his country.<br />For those who put down the writing of the film, it did make effective use of foreshadowing twice, once where Rafe and Danny play \\"chicken\\" in the air, with Rafe defending the \\"stunt\\" as a way of \\"keeping his edge\\" (later on in the film they use this stunt in combat), and in another, where the Cuba Gooding character complaints to Evelyn about not being allowed to fire weapons yet.  \\"Let's hope you never have to\\" is her eerie response.<br />While D-Day may have been the beginning of the end of World War II, the war's turning point could be traced to the point at which the remains of the Pacific Fleet, in the midst of being attacked by an airborne fleet numbering almost four hundred, began to fight back from the ground, and in the air, taking out 29 enemy aircraft.  At that point, the third wave of the attack was called off because the element of surprise, Japan's major weapon, was gone.<br />For anyone who wonders why we dropped atomic weapons on Japan, Pearl Harbor answers them.  This was a brutal enemy of tremendous intelligence and force, using weapons specifically designed to destroy us and which were superior to our own.<br />On the social side, the film provides a bit of a time capsule of the racism and sexism inherent in the era: blacks are shown playing music, boxing, and performing menial tasks in uniform, while women are shown in the nurturing roles of nurses, wielding influence over the men on a personal level while leaving them in charge institutionally.  The image portrayed in both cases is not one of oppression, but of a system in which gender and racial roles were well-defined and people were expected to conform to those roles.  The women of that era sought power not by advancing in rank, but instead by showing the vulnerability of the males of that era either on the examining table to receive an injection, or in a social setting where the men solicit the women's attention.  Once the attack commences, the women wind up in charge because most of them were away from its location and then rushed to the scene, suffering casualties of their own.  Some uneasy questions about whether we were better off then or now with the way things are or were are raised, and the answers are not simple.<br />Once the shock of the attack wore off, and the soldiers began to regroup, the transformation from the military \\"working holiday\\" that many thought their stations were to an armed force united against a common and deadly enemy was complete.  This movie captured brilliantly both the ferocity and impotence of the attack: a seemingly never-ending assault on our ships is juxtaposed against a cowardly invader retreating the moment we began to fight back.<br />The casting of Dan Ackroyd as a decoder was an excellent detail; no other actor in Hollywood would have done with those few lines he had what he was able to.  ... .<br />Like other recent epics such as \\"The Patriot\\" or \\"Any Given Sunday,\\" taking a large slice of Americana and putting it on film to perfection is a hopelessly lost cause. Those who would make the film historically accurate would offer a dull rendition of it, too focused on details and not cognizant of the need to be able to tell a story and make it interesting as a movie, without compromising the facts upon which it is based.<br />This movie achieves these aims on all counts.  A compelling production.nding assault on our ships is juxtaposed against a cowardly invader retreating the moment we began to fight back.  <br />The casting of Dan Ackroyd as a decoder was an excellent detail; no other actor in Hollywood would have done with those few lines he had what he was able to.  ... .<br />Like other recent epics such as \\"The Patriot\\" or \\"Any Given Sunday,\\" taking a large slice of Americana and putting it on film to perfection is a hopelessly lost cause.

B000069CWE|1.0|Dear Linkin Park<br />This new release is even worse than its predecessor, a weak album containing not a trace of creativity.  I consider this and your other work to be personally offensive and a deliberate downgrade on the hard rock community.  Like Limp Bizkit, Staind, Papa Roach and so many other acts, this release shows a total disconcern for how well metal has been done before and feeds on the fact that kids today have no background, and no not that at one time not so far in the past hard rock was done MUCH better than this.<br />Just my opinion.
0425107469|5.0|I rarely read books over 200 pages because I simply just don't have the patience to.  But this book, every page is filled with suspense!!!  It simply captivates you and gives you chills down your back!  Seriously, after reading this book, I bought tons of other thrillers by Dean Koontz, but I never finished any of them because they all had boring moments, but not Watchers.  You will definitely enjoy reading this book and you will regret not buying it sooner!!

B00000JCOV|2.0|First off, I'll point out that this is not death metal,despite the fact that the band trys to make it seem that way. Not that I particularly care for that genre, but I have heard some death metal; just one reason why this isn't death metal, at times Corey would go back to his normal voice and just sing or rap, meaning this would not go down in the death metal category. As for the music, it was nothing that good or nothing that I haven't heard before. I do think they have some talent with the drummer(Joey I think his name is) and some decent guitarists who can play their instruments and play them well at times, but do they have to swear every second word? And Corey does have a nice voice when he decides to sing with it. I've heard worse, but I think Slipknot needs to come up with something a little more original.

B000002KN8|2.0|Right from the beginning, with track #1 (\\"New Life\\"), I pretty much knew what to expect from the rest of this CD: fluffy, upbeat synth/pop that made me feel like I was ODing on \\"sweetness\\". Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.<br />The only two decent tracks on \\"Speak and Spell\\" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (\\"Puppets\\"), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (\\"Just Can't Get Enough\\"), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two \\"pretty boy\\" songs: #4 (\\"Boys Say Go!\\") and #6 (\\"What's Your Name?\\"). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario. Depeche Mode fan or not, you can skip this CD and not feel guilty about it.

B00004YRQA|5.0|I love this memory card.  I was sharing a memory card with my brother for a while, and I found that some games allowed only one save per card, so I bought another one.  It's great to have my own now, and although you can get cards with more space, they are significantly less stable than the official one.  Buy this one, it's hard to fill 8 megs unless you have more than 8 games with multiple saves.
B000069HKH|5.0|This album has a bittersweet healing effect. I recommend it not only for Springsteen fans, but also those trying to deal with the shock and grief of September 11, 2001.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Smiths, in their heyday, were never considered a great album group--at least by my sampling of their critics in the US who never got the point. This album proves those critics wrong. In its own way as important as 'Never Mind the Bollocks' or 'London Calling'. Melodic, often dissonant, with many influences on display, but at a time when the band seemed in full control of their complementary powers. It's hard to find anything comparable to Morrissey and Marr. Not Lennon and McCartney nor Strummer and Jones, but such parallels come close.
0316666343|5.0|This is a book with tremendous creativity, while at the same time allowing readers who have experienced no tragedy to see what is behind the headlines: how people are hurt, how they handke tragedy, how police, because they see so much tragedy, are too quick to discont what may be true.<br />In 1964 my sister was killed by a drunk driver. I've often said that such an active is no different than pre-meditated murder since people \\"know\\" death is always out there waiting for someone who doesn't drive right. Lovely Bones had a significant impact on me, because I could see how normal emotional hurt can be.<br />I would recommend that everyone read it. In this summer where there has been so much publicity about kidnappings, we all need to have a better understanding of the effects of such tragedy which never end but leavesd an empty place in one's heart forever.
B000069CWE|5.0|First off, let me just say that i NEVER give anything 5 stars. The last 5-star cd I wrote about was actually Hybrid Theory. Since then, I haven't really found anything worthy of 5 stars. I have heard good stuff, but not 5 star stuff. Untill this. LP is an absolutely amaziong band. I was wery of this at first since remixes are normally terrible, with maybe just a few instruments tweaks and a faster chorus. Not exactly high-grade. But, LP actually proves that remixes can be a great thing if worked on thoroughly. This cd proves that the band is genuinely interested in making great music, not just pocketing money before they release a cd of new material. You may think a remix project is a major sellout (Think Puff Daddy, o sorry P. Diddy)but here its not. One of the things I appreciate most is they don't say &quot;This is a remix&quot; on all the songs. Yes, we know it is a remix cd, thanks for the info. That bothers me a lot. LP has proved themselves worthy of applause and further cement their career in this amazing cd.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Yet another example of what happens when an otherwise philosophical story falls victim to Hollywood's thirst for the young target-market.  While the time travel sequences are beauties to behold in their own right, one quickly discovers that there is little else besides them to enjoy in the movie.  The story is flat, and deviates from the author's original story and intent even more so than the 1960 version.<br />The Eloi are not the mentally-underdeveloped, short, childlike beings with large eyes and small mouths, but rather are tanned, voluptuous creatures with intelligence enough to quip at the Time Traveler as being a `wandering idiot'; the Morlocks are not the pale, collective workers operating on the base instinct of habit and hunger, but rather are overwhelming monsters resembling more the undead than an offshoot of humanity, led of course by a charismatic ultra-intelligent Uber-Morlock (who somehow has the clairvoyance to dictate to the Time Traveler why he is there and why his cause will fail).<br />This movie, as the first, deviates from the original novel: Weena (Mara), instead of her dramatic death in a massive fire trying to escape the Morlocks, lives to serve as romantic appeal as mate of the Time Traveler.  And once again we miss the awe-inspiring scene where the Time Traveler reaches forward to the twilight of the earth to witness a non-rotating planet locked in an eternal sunset, watching the remnants of what was the human race return at last to the sea in the form of football-shaped creatures.<br />While this movie is a feast to the imagination with its captivating sequences of time flashing by in an instant, if you are seeking more depth in a film version of a Wells novel, I'm sorry to say that this movie is not for you.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have every episode on tape at home. I play it on in rotation, and I think I can honestly say that I know much of Seinfeld by heart. It never ceases to make me laugh and to amaze me of its brillience. Guys - Seindfeld on DVD is a must! Not only the seasons, but as much extra material as possible - commentary, outtakes, screenplays, interviews, etc. You owe it to the fans, Jerry. Give us something we could cherish forever.
B000068TPN|5.0|I am an avid reader of World History and have read more than 15 books on the Vietnam war, and <BR>honestly this movie is the closest I have ever got in truly comprehending what actually happended<BR>in November 1965. The way that Randall Wallace has composed this movie is exceptional. Acting by<BR>both Mel Gibson and the epigrammatic, yet, stunning appearance by Chris Klien is superb. Just<BR>superb.<br />We sometimes tend to believe that war is just something ordinary. It just shows up at your <br />doorstep. All you have to do is just fight off the enemy. You win you lose. You die, you survive.<BR>Actually its really not that simple. Its a very complex scenario, a scenario I have never ever<BR>experiened in any motion picture. Well yes, might have in \\"Saving private Ryan\\", but not till <BR>the extent, which was shown in this motion picture. The cameras were truly right where the action<BR>was. Not too far and not too close, just perfect. Its like youre actually there. Its like youre<BR>the one with the gun, the one who the enemy is after, the one who needs to survive.<br />The music is wonderfully composed. The timing is exact. I mean, in some of the previous<BR>war movies, music just starts off without any rhime or reason. However, in this movie, it <BR>just truly motivates you. At times, the movie touches you deep within. How people with families,<BR>people with hopes, people with dreams just die in a war. And how both American and Vietnamese<BR>soldiers died in November 1965. And most important of all, this movie is not only one sided,<BR>but it refletcs adequate light on both the Vietnamese and the American side.
B000066NW0|5.0|I orgingally bought the CD just for Complicated but I love all the songs.  It's the perfect CD for crusing in the car with friends or listening to when alone and feeling down.  She has a way of saying girls rock without reminding you of the Spice Girls.
0316666343|5.0|A lovely book, beautifully written.  Two parts thriller, three parts coming-of-age, one part religious meditation.  For once,  a book worthy of the hype.  I wept at the end, partly because I didn't want it to be over!

1572523166|4.0|David Bowie is one of my two or three favourite solo artists and I'd been wanting to watch this move for a long time. When I began watching it, it seemed very interesting but after a few minutes it felt like the movie was going to be a disaster. Thankfully, about half way through it suddenly picked up and I found the rest of the movie very entertaining, albeit in a bizarre way. Its a very arty film but still pretty accessible. Unfortunately there is no David Bowie music in it but the plot is interesting nad Bowie gives a fair performance.It also has some great lines in it like: &quot;You know the thing about television is that it doesn't really tell you anything.&quot;<BR>In a nutshell, the movie is about an alien who lands on earth on a mission and the difficulty he encounters. The ending is great. I never expected it.<BR>This is one of those movies where you see things happen early on but don't understand their significance. Later, when more is revealed, then you get it. That may be one of the reasons I didn't like the earlier scenes as much as the later ones.<BR>Finally, I have heard that bootlegs of a lost soundtrack for this album are available if you know where to look for them. I'm still searching.
079075116X|4.0|After recently buying the VHS version of the movie, I knew I was buying a good movie, but I had forgotten how brilliant it was.<br />Although it is predictable to a certain degree, the way the plot and action unfolds keeps you thoroughly entertained. Clint Eastwood does well in a role that is out of character for him - someone who has to follow orders to the T. The only downside to the movie is the dated special effects. But the music which is used when we first see the 'Firefox' makes up for it by giving the plane a menacing character.<br />A final word to Warner Bros - judging by the quality - or lack of it - released on DVD from the same period, I cannot see why you guys have not launched a DVD. We are missing it out here.
B000001Y5J|5.0|I could easily say that Broken is, in my opinion, the best EP released by nine inch nails.  The keywords are angst, bondage and anger.  The cd only lasts about a half an hour with two of the songs being hidden as tracks #98 (physical) and #99 (suck).  As some of the other reviews have mentioned vids were made for most of the songs (included on the \\"closure\\" vhs) but they didn't mention the broken movie, which is banned and never offically released, it can be obtained thru some methods but we wont get into that ^__~ [the broken movie includes pinion(#1), wish(#2)(with a fxxking amazing concert scene), help me i am in hell(#4), happiness in slavery(#5) (one of the movies more *different* scenes), and ends on gave up(#6), so last(#3), physical(#98) and suck(#99) werent included, so it totals at 20mins]  (just as a warning, the broken movie is banned for a good reason that it is explicit and, to some, disturbing, but a must for all hardcore nin fans/halo collectors.) so in short, the broken EP is a must for anyone with an interest in NIN or just the industrial scene.
B00005N915|4.0|This is one of those few movies which you can watch more than once and it is probably advisable to do so.When seen again it becomes evident how well the various elements have been brought together to accentuate the story.The soundtrack,the use of surreal images and the acting indicate the depth of talent involved in this production.<br />The choice of songs truly captures the era,but for me it is the background music used during Harry's flashbacks and his symbolic dreams that make the movie as far as the soundtrack is concerned.It creates the impression that there is a malevolent presence over Harry and that the case has initiated images of a past come back to haunt him.<br />The flashbacks and surreal images make it a beautiful movie to watch and these images play on your mind as if they a making a psychological impact on yourself.These images are well timed and do not fragment the film nor does it come across as pretentious art.<br />The actor's performances are very strong in this film and there is not one actor I feel I could criticise.Robert de Niro's cameo appearance is brilliant and he portrayed his character as being a man of mysterious origin and is utterly confident in himself.This portrayel of the Devil is preferable to Al Pacino's more animated and comedic Lucifer.Pacino's character seems to be engineered for mass appeal in a blockbuster movie while De Niro's is created for suspense and chill factors.Mickey Rourke is superb and it is a pity that we do not see him in more movies.<br />Anybody wishing to view this movie should watch it again to analysis the story and only then can this production be truly appreciated.I gave this movie 8/10.
B000065V1V|5.0|I've been a Bowie fan since Low. But after his Hours album I kind of gave up on him. So I just found out about Heathen.<br />Its very good and interestingly contains something many Bowie albums (even the ones I like) lack -- songs you can humm to!
B000063K2W|5.0|This is one of the best films that I have ever seen about the emergence of modern women in 20th century America. It would work nicely as a companion piece to The Graduate. I, in fact, use both films when teaching a class on the role of women in 20th century America. The ending to the film, The Women, never ceases to amaze the young girls in the class...the idea of Mary throwing open her arms and welcoming back her wayward husband is shocking to most of the young students. It is certainly a period piece and certainly well worth viewing to see how few options were open to most women of the era. Putting everything into an historical perspective, it is difficult to believe that this was filmed less than two decades after American women were given the vote and only two decades prior to the Women's Rights movement actually kicking into high gear. It really is a wonderful depiction of women who where stuck in the middle of a changing society and how they were having to adapt and change in order to move onward.<br />As was noted in one of the earlier reviews, this film was made with an entirely female cast. I wouldn't swear to it, but I believe that I read somewhere that Cuckor was so obsessive about that fact that he even insisted that any of the animals who appear in the film also be female. That may have been Hollywood publicity, but it does make for fun viewing and an interesting anecdote.

B00003CXXR|5.0|Unlike the Lost Word JP this sequel remains closer to the viewpoints of the original, Jurassic Park. Reflecting the same concept of how dangerous biotechnology can be when developed with greedy motivations and no real moral reasoning. This opinion is held by the film's lead character, Dr. Alan Grant, who is from the first movie, as well as Ellie Sattler. I was glad to see that they brought back these two favorites of mine, and found them to remain true to their original characters in Jurassic Park. Although it seems like Grant was slightly made into the Indiana Jones type, because there are segments that give similar impressions. Also, JP III has some situations that are reminiscent to the first film, which was nice.<br />Despite what anyone else thinks, I'm going to say that the acting in this film is great, I really love it, and Tea Leoni did an admirable job. The actions and reactions of all the characters appear completely natural, making it a believable experience to watch. Once again the dinosaur animation is outstanding! The raptors are truly amazing! The movie becomes quite unpredictable, with suspense that just won't quit. All seasoned with a bit of humor at the right timing. The scenes are excellent and the camera flow is superb, making use of some fantastic angles to tell the story. It just has a way of grabbing your attention through sight, sound and emotion. <br />I'm a DIE-HARD Jurassic Park fan, and even if I wasn't, I still think I would recommend this movie. Because it's just one bazaar thrill ride of narrow escapes for those of you who like disaster/survival adventures where man verses nature, (or in this case, beasts of terror.) It has no out right swearing, but still heed the PG-13 rating. Compared to the 2 previous films,  this one has some of the most gruesome images. It's a bit obvious that a sequel is to follow, and it seems too, that this film was made with the prospect of another theme park ride in mind. But these things didn't totally ruinthe excitement of the movie. Personally, I think Jurassic Park III is a far BETTER sequel than the Lost World JP and wish I could double underline the word BETTER.<br />And oh yeah, even if you're somewhat of a Jurassic Park fan, don't hesitate a bit. Get this one on DVD or VHS; it won't be as disappointing as you might be lead to believe.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This band is...horrible. Dreadful. Terrible. Uninteresting. And they are a disgrace to rock. How You Remind Me is completely dumb. Too Bad...well, too bad for them that no one will but their album. No good hard rock songs make this a horrible 1-star CD. Do not buy it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Since I'm a fan of pop/rock and I heard that Avril Lavigne was a talented pop/rock artist and after hearing the catchy 'Complicated' on the radio, I decided to check her out. Boy was I NOT dissapointed! After hearing the rest of the album, it turns out that her first single doesn't nearly match up next to the rest of the rocking tunes! Check this out, definately. Here's a quick over-view of the songs on 'Let Go' and my rating (1 to 10).<br />1. Losing Grip- A rocking track with a hard chorus and catchy verses. I love this rock track, although it's not my favorite it has an awesome angry feeling to it. 8/10.<br />2. Complicated- I'm sooo sick of this song (waayy overplayed) but it's still good. Everyone's heard this. 7/10. (Originally 8/10.)<br />3. Sk8er Boi- This track is a bit, well cheesy. Anyway, it sort of tells a story of a girl who dumps a guy at her first impression. It's ok but nothing special. One of the weaker tracks. 7/10.<br />4. I'm With You- A more sad, deeper soft rock song. Excellent choruses and verses and it's more of a ballad. Her vocals are imprssive here too. One of the highlights. 9/10.<br />5. Mobile- Another 'weak' track. Has some punk and guitar plays, but that's about it. Nothing that great about it. 6.5/10.<br />6. Unwanted- Awesome raging hard-rock track. Guitars to match! She's beyond angry at someone for shutting her out before they get to know her. Excellent! 8/10.<br />7. Tomorrow- Another soft ballad, but this one has a more depressed feeling for it. This is one of my favorites. She sings beautifully. She's basically saying that she doesn't know what to feel anymore. 10/10.<br />8. Anything But Ordinary- Another one of my favorites. Perfectly describes anyone who doesn't want to be just a normal girl including Avril herself. Pretty easy to relate to, this one is very very good with extremely catchy and creative lyrics. Should be the next single after 'Sk8er Boi'. 10/10.<br />9. Things I'll Never Say- A good popish track about not being able to tell someone how you feel. Another great track that's easy to relate to. 9/10.<br />10. My World- Ok, if you live in a small suburban town this one is for you! I live in one and this is a track that perfectly captures the feeling of it. 8.5/10.<br />11. Nobody's Fool- She sort of in a way talks/raps the verses which is surprisingly catchy! 8/10.<br />The last two tracks 'Too Much To Ask' and 'Naked' are both okay but nothing impressive. Anyway, be sure to pick this up. Avril has promising potential of being a classic female rock artist!
B000006OHL|5.0|One thing I'll never understand are the people who either don't get this film or the music that Bernard Herrmann composed for it. Get this straight right now: Taxi Driver is one of the greatest, best, and most important films ever made in any country at any time and Bernard Herrmann is without a doubt one of the top three or four film composers of all time and probably the greatest. The music Herrmann wrote for Taxi Driver, as were all his film scores, is wholly unique and perfectly tailored for the film it was written for. Unlike most other film scorers, Herrmann did not apply the exact same orchestral score to his films, but rather chose specific instruments that captured something essential about the film or scene. In his score for Taxi Driver, Herrmann uses the saxophone as the central voice. Since the beginnings of Jazz and blues, sax has been an instrument that speaks of human lonliness. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, captures the mood, the feel, the very idea of lonliness better than a solitary saxaphone in the darkness and this score makes great use of this fact. Herrmann's Taxi Driver score veers deceptively from cheezy jazz, to deep blues, to ominous experimentalism. Second to the sax in Herrmann's score are the drums, which periodically either roll out an off-kilter military beat or disrupts the aural surroundings with the thud of a bass drum. Then, always, after the insanity, the generic jazziness comes back in, covering up the disturbing truth with a fairly innocuous veneer that by the end cannot contain the ugliness underneath. Bernard Herrmann was THINKING when he scored his films, and that, my friends, is what truly sets him apart from all other composers. His scores by themselves make better movies, in your head, anyway, that even some of the greatest filmmakers could perform with casts of thousands. Even the great Morricone is Herrmann's inferior, though to say such a thing is the height of absurdity. Bernard Herrmann didn't just write movie music, he made a statement and his contributions to the films he worked on rivalled those of the major crew memebers, from actors and director and scriptwriter to the cinematographer. And when Herrmann wrote for lesser films he sometimes provided the one and only thing that made these films watchable (just listen to his score for Journey to the Center of the Earth and you'll know, but if you still can't see/hear it then I hereby revoke your right to watch movies and command you to seek counseling immediately!). Okay, so there you have it, the undisputable truth. Yes, Taxi Driver is, especially in these days of hyperactive overstatement, a boring film to some degree and the music for it does deceive the simple minded among us with its difficult to penetrate veneer. But if you are still stuck in the cranky infant stage of \\"Waaah! I'm bored, someone stimulate me!\\" then heaven help you. You need to grow up, and right quick. You need to give things time, you need to seek insight, you need to grow up and get a brain. Don't be swayed by your knee jerk \\"opinions,\\" learn to understand things, learn to see and hear, or get off my planet right now.
B000066NW0|4.0|Losing Grip- One of the better tracks on the album. Has a catchy hard rock chorus and tight guitar riffs. 4/5 stars.<br />Complicated- I'm soo sick of this tune that I'm not even going to bother...2/5 stars.<br />Sk8er Boi- My LEAST favorite track on the album. Her lyrics are immature and corny here. The guitar is pretty bland as well. I'd recommend you skip this...even though unfortunately it is the new single! 0/5 stars.<br />I'm With You- A softer rock beat and lyrics tell a story of Avril's own. A beautiful song, it's one of the highlights. 4/5 stars.<br />Mobile- Another kind of blah song. Nothing special. 1/5 stars.<br />Unwanted- Another great hard rock track! This one captured my attention even though it's not my favorite. 3/5 stars.<br />Tomorrow- A soft-lullaby-like track that's very soothing. One of the highlights again. 4/5 stars.<br />Anything But Ordinary- Great lyrics, a very unique rock track! 4/5 stars.<br />Thing I'll Never Say- Another impressive rock track. What more is there to say? 4/5 stars.<br />My World- The best track on the album. If you live in a small town easy to relate to and has creative beats and lyrics. 5/5 stars.<br />Nobody's Fool- Great verses, she can rap well! Boring chorus...but still an impressive track. 5/5 stars.<br />Too Much Too Ask- Well, it's not great but it's ok. 3/5 stars.<br />Naked- See above. 3/5 stars.<br />Overall I definately recommend Avril's 'Let Go' in addition to Vanessa Carlton, 'Be Not Nobody' and Michelle Branch's 'The Spirit Room' who are all impressive female rockers with bright futures. My favorite tracks here are Losing Grip, I'm With You, Tommorow, My World, and Nobody's Fool. Recommended!
B000063DHL|5.0|I first bought this on album back in 1986, (Still have on album, and now on CD.) By far Maiden's most underrated album. From beginning to end this album rocks with energy. The songs are as always meaningful, and the album art is awesome, (the album has much more detail than the CD does.) Maiden is the most intense heavy metal band of all time. The video's that come with this CD are great. Love the way they give the fan their money's worth with all the enchanced CD's they have.. Thanks guys....
0804106304|4.0|I really liked The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan. Her short stories seemed so real, instead of fiction.  Ms. Tan had such insight into the characters & what they had to deal with.She was also so creative in these stories. Ms. Tan definitely demonstrated the feelings of women at different ages and showed how your perception of life changes from age & lifestyle. The Joy Luck Club also displayed the strength that women possess to get through really difficult times. I gave this book a 4 because it was fantastic & I read it quickly but not a 5 because it was not perfect.

B00004YRQA|5.0|As other reviews have stated, you need this to get the full functionality out of your Playstation 2.  I'm suprised that Sony hasn't started including at least one with their PS2s yet (hint hint to Sony) since they are really important.<br />Also, I'm glad that they're black, which matches the PS2 and all of my home A/V equipment.  Modern A/V equipment is black and rectangular, something Nintendo would do well to learn from.  If Nintendo would just spend some time watching Batman Beyond, they would learn the future of A/V equipment and be forward-thinking like Sony.  Sony knows how to make things black, all the way from their game systems, controllers, computers, and finally their memory cards.  Batman Beyond would certainly approve.
B0000640VO|1.0|Why on Earth bother?<br />M. Jeunet's folly? OR is this a tiresome continuation of the infinite RED and GREEN period [worked well in the previous excursions, but give it a break!]<br />Pass this one please - and a comparison to Audrey Hepburn? [Audrey and Leslie Caron hold this patent.]<br />Shame! This one is really unintelligible - regress to \\"Children of Paradise\\" - now that's original.<br />BETTER still - do see \\"Lili\\" or \\"Story of Three Loves\\" - BY far superior to this over-indulgent little saga of fromage du jour......
6305265666|5.0|The two young leads in this beautiful rendering of the Cinderella Story posess such lovely chemistry, one can actually forgive some of the historical mistakes included in this film. Dougray Scott portrays the handsome, regal (if somewhat befuddled)Prince Henry who 'suffers from an arranged marriage' and wishes 'only to be freed from his gilded cage'(ie; the responsibilities of his royal lineage) and find his true love and purpose in life. He finds both in the form of a poor servant girl Danielle (Drew Barrymore actually stretching a bit, albeit with an iffy accent that comes and goes)whom he mistakes as a Countess and falls madly in love with. Angelica Houston is note perfect as the evil Stepmother Rodmilla DeGhent, she makes every line she utters fairly drip with contempt and bitterness, and Patrick Godfrey is flawless as Leonardo Da Vinci, the artist in residence at the castle, home to King Francis(Timothy West) and his lovely Queen (Judy Parfitt). This is essentially a typical boy meets girl story and the resolution is reached almost too easily and tidy for my taste, but what elevates this piece far and above it's peers is the lush cinematography and enthusiastic cast who seem to be having the time of thier lives. \\"Ever After\\" is grandly entertaining.
B000060MY6|5.0|Mulholland Drive is hands-down the best movie of 2001.  I always tell people it's &quot;great,&quot; &quot;genius,&quot; etc., but before you watch it, you really just need to know that it's *weird.*  Easily the weirdest movie I've ever seen.  Don't expect it to make 100% sense, or even 20% sense, really. (Salon.com has an excellent explanation for the movie, which makes the movie all the better.)  All that matters about Mullholland Drive is that it completely wraps you up in this story of a girl, (Naomi Watts- devastatingly brilliant) who movies to California to become a movie star. (Or is that REALLY what it's about.......?)<br />Maybe &quot;insane&quot; is a better adjective than &quot;weird.&quot;  After all, the line between genius and insanity...
B00005R2M3|3.0|After resisting her new, blonde-bombshell American debut album for so long, I finally gave in and bought Laundry Service. I have to say, it is better than I expected.<BR>All of the songs are very different and well-produced, and Shakira's being a foreigner to America has protected her from using cliched lyrics in her songs (&quot;your hydrponic pot&quot; and &quot;don't forget that your condemned to me&quot; come to mind), and the entire album definitely shows her attempts at growing artistically.<BR>Sadly, though, it still falls short in some places. The songs &quot;Que me Quedes Tu&quot; and &quot;Fool&quot; seem too much like filler, &quot;The One&quot; has the most annoying backing vocals EVER, and Shakira's performance of &quot;Eyes Like Yours,&quot; the English version of &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; is laughable.<BR>Still, the rest of the album is very fun and heaetfelt, and Shakira's growth as an expiremental artist are clearly shown, especially during the Tango-influenced &quot;Objection (Tango),&quot; the South American feel of &quot;Suerte/Whenever Whenever,&quot; and the 70's disco feel of &quot;Ready For The Good Times.&quot; It is an all-around good record.<BR>High Points: Objection (Tango) (it has a lot more juice than it's Spanish counterpart), Rules (oh oh ahh!), Te Dejo Madrid (keep thinking of the video in which she runs with giant scissors), Poem to a Horse (that screamy bit after the first repetition of the chorus), and Suerte (so cool!).
B00005QZWI|5.0|While Peter Jackson's film was one of the best ever made in any genre, and the acting was marvelous - if Tolkien was the movie's heart,  Shore's score was the soul of The Fellowship of the Ring.  When I first heard that Howard Shore was scoring LOTR, I was quite unfamiliar with his work.  I had no idea what to expect but was more than pleasantly surprised after seeing the movie.  The soundtrack to the Fellowship of the Ring is almost Wagnerian in scope, full orchestra, heavy brass and percussion, and chorus. He put the choruses to much greater use than Jerry Goldsmith did in \\"The Omen,\\" John Williams in \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" backing not only action sequences, but love, friendship, and goodbye sequences in the film.  Depending on the mood of a scene, he uses his music to paint the emotions of the characters before they have spoken a single word, as heard in \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" - to accentuate the action sequences, as heard in \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum\\" -  and to make the characters in this wonderful fantasy seem almost tragic, heroic, and completely three-dimensional, as heard in \\"Amon Hen.\\" <br />Almost every composer has her/his own unique style. (There are a few hacks out there blatantly ripping of the classics - note for note.)  This soundtrack is not one endless string of melodies. Shore's scoring makes abundant use of solo flutes, violins, recorders, solo treble voices to create music that is both familiar but completely original.  At times Shore's LOTR score has a Celtic flavor, but not enough to make you feel you are at a Riverdance concert.  While William's music is highly thematic and very structured - verses, choruses, repeats, etc., Shore's music seems to be thematic but with less structure, and very intense.  Percussive in the action sequences.  In the theater my hands were over my eyes during the Khazad Dum sequence.  I now realize one of the contributing factors,  other than my fear of heights, was the score. On the other end of the scale, Enya's Elven touch on her solo vocals in mesmerizing.  If you are buying this CD for the toe-tapping melodies you'll be sadly disappointed, but the job of the composer is to write music which blends with the action of the film - not produce a hit record.<br />There have been some wonderful soundtracks out there in recent history.  The Shawshank Redemption.  Glory.  The Red Violin.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Phantom Menace.  Just to name a few.  And The Fellowship of the Ring can take its place with them as one of the great scores of all time.

B000007MVM|5.0|First of all, if your just a Floyd fan and not also a Barrett fan, u should just stop reading. But anyways The Madcap Laughs have songs that some can be described as some of the best Syd ever wrote. The songs range from strange love ballads such as \\"Terrapin\\" where the things in love are sea creatures, to \\"No man's land\\" where syd shows he was still able to play awesome guitar, and up to \\"Octupus\\" which i think is the highlight of the album(also its where the album gets its title from the line, \\"the madcap laghed at the man on the border\\")There are some songs though that seemed just a bit rushed as for one thing you can hear them talking in the studio, and in such as in the song \\"Feel\\" & \\"If it's in you\\" Syd seems nervous and in the latter can't seem to figure out what key to sing in. But put all together it makes for a landmark album by one of music's greatest songwriter ever. Anyone who likes this should also get \\"Barrett\\" which is another fine album by Syd.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Critics overwhelmingly loved this movie, so I rented it. First off, the DVD isn't broken up into chapters. I couldn't finish it in my first sitting and was faced with a choice: pause it all day or restart it later. That should have been my first clue. I watch a lot of the DVD extras and hear directors grieving about scenes they loved but had to cut because it didn't drive the story forward. THIS STORY MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. I paid attention to various plot elements, waiting for their meaning to come to bear later on. They never did. Just when you think you're lost, David Lynch throws in a huge plot twist (with that blue box) that confuses you twice as much. I loved Vanilla Sky, another movie with heavy plot twists; but Vanilla Sky tied up its loose ends. I still have no idea what this movie is supposed to be about. If Lynch's other movies are this nonsensical, then they should take away his license to direct feature films. And curses to all the reviewers that gave it such high marks. You let me down big time. (Note: The only redeeming quality of this film is a 60 second-ish lesbian love scene. It's decent, and I'm not a fan of lesbian love scenes.)
B000002UAU|4.0|When I listen to this album it sounds like the Beatles were jaded from too much songwriting that they felt like being sarcastic and pretending to be  fictitious characters and that left George Martin with the creative responsibilities of making average material sound interesting with his studio tricks and distinctive psychedelic/classical production and that's what people see as being revolutionary about this album.Sgt. Pepper's isn't even in my top 5 Beatles LP's because it really sounds like they were just messing around, but it still sounds classic.
6305451591|4.0|When I first heard of the movie, I didn't think that it would be that great.  However, I was wrong.  This takes the idea of a Holocaust movie and makes it much more personal than any other movie I've seen.  The movie makes the prisioners seem like real people and not just \\"Random Jew\\" like in other movies.  The one complaint is the Benigni is not \\"labeled\\" Jewish until half way through the movie.  A must see for any student.
B000002U82|5.0|A themed album about the potential of society's pressures to drive a fellow to paranoid insanity, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was a quantum leap for Pink Floyd, launching them out of BBC Top Gear reverie and into arenas and stadiums. At this time, Roger Waters' lyrics weren't yet so weighty or preachy as to mention their subjects by name (as they would become on \\"Animals\\" and forever later), so his brilliant words fit extremely well with the beautifully constructed, psychedelic music, mostly the creations of Pink Floyd's music department (Dave Gilmour, Richard Wright, and to a slightly lesser extent, Nick Mason).<br />The lyrics never overshadow or outweigh the music, which even by itself could have made a substantial landmark of a record. Two of Wright's musical responsibilities, 'The Great Gig and the Sky' and 'Us and Them' are evocative masterpieces, and Waters' lyrics on the latter are nothing short of eerily poignant. In fact, these were probably the best lyrics ever given to a psychedelic-oriented rock album, even if by 1973, Pink Floyd's \\"psychedelic\\" reputation was ready to fall away to more deliberate pieces of work; 'Money' was the biggest single of Floyd's career at the time ('Another Brick in the Wall Part 2' was still six years away), and 'Time' is an album-rock radio staple to this day.<br />The use of sound effects and spoken word snippets throughout the record were effective and hugely influential for many acts and albums to follow, but it's the flawlessly constructed, equal-band effort that makes it such a wonderful piece of work. Its mystique allowed for \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"'s appearances on Billboard's album chart for a record-breaking fourteen years. Arguably \\"the 'Sgt. Pepper' of the 70s,\\" this monumental 9-track disc made Pink Floyd a name as commonly spouted as that of the Beatles, though Floyd kept their music somehow greater than the individuals who made it.
B000002JNJ|5.0|The fifth album by the clearly poised to rise to the top Pantera, was probably one of the last truly \\"metal\\" albums in the mainstream in the 90's (unless you consider nu metal metal) . There is a clear quality and almost innocent aura about the album since Phil and company have steadily become more extreme  in lifestyle and music as time went on. Far Beyond Driven is half noisy metal and half groove splendor, Vulgar Display is excellent and much better, but Cowboys from Hell is classic. Sounding like a clear combination between their 1988 album \\"Power Metal\\" (Phil's debut),  and the late eighties early nineties band Exhorder, with a bit of Testament and Metallica thrown in for good measure, Cowboys from Hell still has a charm that has not dilluted throughout the years. It also has power, melody and variation, something than most bands influenced by them could learn more. Also recommended is the aforementioned  \\"Power Metal\\" which has a lot more Halford esque screams and almost more intensity. The only thing is good luck finding it, you can only find it by the way of often expensive bootleg. I have heard most of the mp3s and can honestly say it is definitely NOT GLAM though the cover is a bit cheesy and close to it. Its too bad theyre ashamed of their image back then and don't differentiate it from the music when even \\"I am the Night\\" had some cool stuff too (also not as \\"glam\\" as people say).  Maybe we should petition the Pantera camp to rerelease these! (Though we know it will probably never happen!)
B0000025D0|5.0|Bruce Springsteen endured nearly three years of court battles and personal betrayal after his 1975 breakthrough &quot;Born To Run.&quot; This two and a half year stall in his newfound streak of acclaim added to the many frustrations in his creative career. All of that angst and bitterness that came from three years of this inspired the genuine pain and scorn of Springsteen's 1978 masterpiece &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town.&quot;<br />In the course of these endless legal battles, Springsteen saw a true darkness in people, even in his personal managers and companions. This realization no doubt inspired the Boss to turn his generic subject matter of exploring the lives of ordinary people, into a more brooding look at the reality that comes with everyday life, and in everyday lives. &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; is in many ways a rock and roll echo of the writings of short story author Sherwood Anderson--expressing the often frustrated lives of ordinary people in small cities (the one place many people only expect to find a naive eutopia, while most of us expect the darker reality to be found in the dirty streets of the big city). Springsteen's 1978 masterpiece of scorn and pain is a close contender for the title of his best work, mainly for two reasons; at this time, his habit of expressing the frustrations of ordinary people had not yet lost its luster and fresh originality. But most of all, &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; strays far from what flaws most albums expressing this subject--cliche`. Here, Springsteen's agonizing, poignant lyrics match the raw instrumentation, which is more separated to punctuate the album's ruggedly emotional mood. While this is only one of the things that makes &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; a fresh break from all of the other attempts by other performers to express the frustrations of everyday people, most of all, it is genuine and inspired, it is real, full of purpose and reality. Springsteen's work here is a rock and roll expression of the sighs that come from small-town gossipers. The character studies in &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; are perfectly balanced, from the ghosts that haunt the wicked woman of 'Candy's Room' to the bitter, self-pitying man in 'Adam Raised a Cain.' The title track alone is the ultimate anthem of the album, and of the people described within it. The power of &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; is an even balance of subtlety and raw power.<br />It would be quite easy for me to sum up how I feel about this album by raving that Springsteen's &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; is the greatest rock and roll album of all time, but it is quite true. No album before or after it has expressed such a raw and genuine purpose, something rock and roll music has always stood for since its birth in the mid-50s. It is honest and dead-on, haunting and real. But most of all, true to its purpose, &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; is the anthem for the bitter, the frustrated, the determined.is a rock and roll expression of the sighs that come from small-town gossipers.

B000002UUX|5.0|Why cant all metal sound like this? This is one of the best metal albums ever made. Good songs, good guitar work. I always feel the songs should come first and this is damn talented metal songwriting. I've always said the best metal music came out from 88-92. This isnt really thrash per se, because some songs are slower and theres too much talent in the songwriting.<br />Theres a band called Sword - Metalized is the cd, that you will love if you like this. Its very rare but worth the wait - amazon sells it.
6303398480|4.0|I Think this movie is pretty darn good! It satisfies the sci-fi part in you and th romantic part at the same time!
B000062YB1|5.0|This is good stuff. Sounds like Nightmare, a band I found on mp3. The songs are good and not just noise and thrashing. That Dead Skin Mask is great. I wish all Slayer was more like this - heavy and catchy! My only complaint with seasons in the abyss is that it needs stronger bass. It sounds a little tinny.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Having never played the video game, I bought this movie only because of the star, the ever beautiful Milla Jovovich.  I've really enjoyed a lot of her past films.  That said, this movie floored me.  I've seen several, video game to big screen adaptations in the past, most of which were horrible.  This is not the case.  Resident Evil is an absolutely great movie that has some great acting on everybody's parts.  I'f you've not taken the time to watch this movie, correct that.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This movie is just absolutely hilarious. It is a sight gag lover's dream, loaded with extremely funny scenes that will have you rolling on the floor.<br />The best thing about the film is that it retains the intricate humour of comedies from the 1980's with the kind of funniness that will make you think, instead of the too common &quot;dumb-dumb&quot; humour of today's comedies. It presents all of this, and also leaves out the gratuitous nudity that seems to be infamous of 1980's comedies as in Airplane! and Caddyshack.<br />From the singing horse to the underwater bar fight, I gaurantee that you will love this film.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I really thought this was a let down.  I have loved all the singles but I realize after listening to this that those are the best songs.  I thought Return of Saturn had some of the best lyrics of the year (Simple Life, Bathwater, Magic's in The Make-up).  But, they were songs about the confusion of love and lust. Unfortunately, Gwen's blissful love state makes for uninteresting prose. There are only so many ways you can say 'I'm in love'. Rock Steady is just a lightweight party record and not really even a great one at that.<BR>   I have utter faith in this band and know they will bounce back but in the meantime skip this one and go buy an old B'52's CD instead.
B000002NJS|5.0|The very first Madonna record I ever purchased, it's a shockingly rich artistic album, the songs flowing from the inside out and creating some defining pop moments in tracks like &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;The Power Of Good-bye&quot;. Both cuts are rich electronic ballads, binding a spiritual vibe to an artificial sound. These single tracks were also joined by &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, and &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot; as single releases. These tracks are at once personal, poetic, and pop, all being catchy songs, the more lyrically odd tracks remained for those who own the album. The spiritual chant &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot;, the freakish &quot;Mer Girl&quot;, and the strange &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; are fine examples of experimentation on this record. This is one of Madge's deepest and best works, and I'm pleased to say, as I had mentioned, that this was the first Madonna album I ever owned, though not the last.
B000066NW0|4.0|I haven't bought a cd in years but I bought this one because I loved Complicated so much.  I was ready to listen to it once or twice and return it but I fell in love with it and haven't had it off my stereo since. Her songs are tough and vunerable and wise and a little naive.  <BR>   There is a lot of range from slow ballads to guitar rock.  Her lyrics are very thoughtful and instead of focusing on boys, boys, boys she seems to go a little more into the feelings of being on the verge of growing up.  <BR>    Anything But Ordinary has already carried me through a tough time and will be a huge hit for her if it is released as a single.  Having found this great cd, I am having trouble listening to all the other female singer/songwriters without getting restless for this music.
0783229321|5.0|DAMN!!!! One of the most funniest movies of all times! It truly defines what college life is and the antics shown in this film are still valid until today. With John Belushi as Bluto, you're guaranteed to be laughing and falling off the seat when you're watching this one. Truly a classic...FOOD FIGHT!!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's CD is by far the best CD I have listened to this summer! It has been in my CD player since the day it came out, and I don't plan on taking it out for quite a while! It is about time we had a girl who isn't a 'pop princess'! Her style of music brings a new meaning to the word 'punk'! GO AVRIL!!!
B000002HPT|4.0|This CD has had so many mixed reviews, so the only thing I can really add to the mix is that (being a big DT fan) this is their CD where they really mixed up some their soft and prog sides.<br />Overall, this does not sound like any other DT CD they own - and it was a big surprise to me too.  I gave it a lot of spins, and concluded that this is really where they were heading as far as the next CD's to come out.  No, it was not as good as 'Images and Words' or anything like that, but think of it as a 'couch test' for the CD's to come - Scenes from a Memory, etc...<br />There are some great tracks on this one, unfortunately there are more ehhhh tracks than the good ones - either way, this is one CD for fans only, and I would redirect any DT novice to the same ones that the others are pointing to...<br />One last note - DT is one band that saved me from my total dismissal of all new prog rock - I thought it was over when Genesis and Yes kind of hanged up their hats, but there is a strong surgence of folk (like me) who would like some great prog rock, even with a bit of tasteful metal thrown in, to be out there.  DT fits the bill, and are the greatest ones to do it!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|ok...this is the total kewlest cd ever and the movie is awesome!  i so suggest it to any one! i am currently wishing i owned it and harassing my friends by singing it! its my favorite thing ever!
B00005RYLE|5.0|I really liked the movie many years ago when I saw it on TV. I loved the way they filmed, the way to make scary moments without using all these CGIs. This version is much cleaner and the sound is brilliant. You really see it as it was intended.<br />The extras are terrific! Bruce Campbell's documentary is very interesting. But the best above all is watching the movie together with Bruce's comments. I never liked to watch a movie with the actors/director comments, but once I started trying it, I could stop, I was laugthing all the time. Brilliant.
B00005ATQ8|1.0|So here's someone who's supposed to be a great director and he has such subject matter as love, war, duels, adultery, espionage, dissipation and corruption of youth, and any number of other themes to work with. And what does he do?  Makes it into a monumental three-hour BORE!  The actors just walk on, say a few lines, walk off.  Ryan O'Neal stands around with his mouth hanging open for most of the movie.  Hardly says a word.  I guess they didn't want it known that he couldn't do an Irish accent very well (or much of anything else except look pretty in his pretty clothes).  It's as if Kubrick did all he could to underplay and downplay everything.  Well, very subtle, very dull. This and 2001 almost put him in the same category of over-rated directors as Hitchcock, though at least Kubrick has Lolita and Dr. Strangelove to his credit.
0345350499|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time, which is a huge title if you know me because i have an extensive lists of favorites and a quite large collection of books.  Without you even realizing it, this book takes you through the lives of three of the women of Morgaine's family, starting with Igraine, then Morgaine, and Viviane as well.  There are no words to describe it.  It is simply exquisite.  Just go buy it.
B00002E233|1.0|The effects killed this movie. It was a great idea for an escapist B-movie, and the build-up to each attack was serviceable - but the absolutely laughably ludicrous CGI effects made the sharks as non-scary as humanly imaginable. They killed the \\"mood\\" each time. Director Harlin erred when he decided to show full-length shark acrobatics and attacks. They came off as cheapo 3D cartoons with cheapo cartoon legs flailing in their mouths. Learn from the horror masters, Renny - Less is more! A few scale shark models, foaming red water, split-second closeups, and ominous music would have been better.<br />Spotting the 'Jaws' and 'Alien' series homages ... was the only entertaining factor after a while. Well, that and Saffron Burrows' flawless face...
6304711875|2.0|Ever since this flick came out, I've heard over and over again how \\"Scream\\" brought the horror genre back to life.<br />Well, if I can steal a line from \\"Pet Sematery,\\" sometimes dead is better.<br />Overall, \\"Scream\\" is an overdone and overrated teen slasher film whose primary distinguishing feature is its satiric cuts at its own genre.  All the familiar horror staples are here, and the characters that live the longest are the ones who realize they're living out a horror movie and play by the rules.  Largely camp, \\"Scream\\" does boast some genuinely scary segments well-orchestrated by legendary horror master Wes Craven, particularly the Drew Barrymore scene that opens the film.  But mostly it's just silly, with all the weaknesses that always doom slasher pix:  too many vapid, sex-starved teens, a reliance on cheap gore instead of real chills, and a lot of low-brow \\"humor.\\"  Moreover, \\"Scream's\\" killer is a terribly inefficient killing machine.  Ghostface often bungles his murders by running or falling over every obstacle in sight, and even when he catches a victim can't figure out how to finish them off.  Neve Campbell's character is likeable, resourceful,  and attractive, but given her inferior competition it's not hard for her to stand out.<br />\\"Scream\\" is a big disappointment, and no matter how many teens swear otherwise it's nothing a horror movie should be.  For a more mature thriller, check out \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and leave the screams for the kids.
B00005LB50|4.0|I've listened to this box set quite a lot over the past few weeks and like it very much. My little joke is to say &quot;there is only one thing wrong with it?&quot; to people. When they say &quot;what&quot;? I say &quot;Steve Stills&quot;....but its just a joke. The Sarge is fine. My real complaint/wonder is why we didn't get versions of Neil singing his great songs? &quot;On the Way Home&quot;, &quot;Clancy&quot;, &amp; &quot;Do I have to Come Right Out and Say It&quot;.....these are such beautiful songs and while Richie sings them nicely, I really need to hear Neil sing them. Does anyone know where I might find such a thing? Are they being saved for the Neil Box Set?  Keep on rockin' in the free world.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This DVD was exactly what I was waiting for.  Not only do you get the greatness that is Sam Raimi's directorial smash, Evil Dead, but you get so much more.  The commentary by Bruce Campbell, and alternate commentary by producer Bob Tapert and director Raimi, puts a whole new spin on a great film.  The packaging is an exact replica of the Book of the Dead found in the movie, complete with drawings and writing.  The book's exterior is made of foam rubber, which gives it a squishy, almost flesh-like feel.  Be sure to look for the cookies on the sides of the special features menus!
B0000640VO|4.0|Wonderful, whimsical, and funny with brilliant cinematography. Eccentric yet universal story of a lonely girl, Amelie, who finds love and purpose in the most unexpected way. I couldn't help but think of Roald Dahl's Matilda. Brilliant work from the man who gave us &quot;City of Lost Children&quot;
B00003CX5P|4.0|Hey, what can I say, I'm a huge Star Wars fan. While I'd love to praise all the moves George Lucas has made in regards to Star Wars, that's just not possible. Star Wars is more like a feeling, a cult movement, instead of the actual content of the movie itself. It's almost a spiritual feeling...so embraced that it allows oneself to(or try really hard to) ignore the bad acting and silly one liners. I suppose that is because of the story and what the story represents(you know...the battle between good and evil or maybe it's because it's childish and most of us were kids when we seen it for the first time). However, I do NOT understand why George had to pick 2 terrible actors to portray Anakin(both the actors in episodes 1 and 2). Perhaps the part is so original that it's too difficult for basic acting? Nonetheless, I still love the movies, but I can't help wanting to smack the 2 actors that play Anakin Skywalker. It's really George's fault. He should have said, \\"Get someone in here that can act!\\" and then told the cute little kid to go home. It couldn't have been a budget issue, do you think?<br />Star Wars is a comical sci-fi that wants to be taken seriously. No problem there George. Just do a better job on the casting for the 3rd and final episode...PLEASE?<br />PS. Great special effects...'nuff said on that issue. Special effects can't carry the movie though. It still has to be enjoyable with good acting all around. *NOTE* acting counts...WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE TELL THAT TO GEORGE?
B00005JKCF|4.0|Bouncy. Fun. Colorful. Faithful.<BR>A very accurate and entertaining interpretation of the classic comic.
B000063UR2|5.0|I really like this movie. The 'Director's Cut' seems to explain a little more. Over all, this movie is a MUST for any true DVD collector. I wouldn't let the little ones watch this though. You'll diffenately want to pre-view it to make sure they can handle it.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Dr. is just that, an anamorphic cinematic tool that brings new meaning to its characters, story and the viewer during and long after each viewing. An exquisite film.

0449002632|5.0|Edward Rutherfurd is my favorite author.  I just love the way he interweaves history with such interesting, fictional characters.
0140277447|5.0|I read through the book and I think it is a very nicely written one.  One minor point is that it would be nicer to note in the text the references documents in the style of academic articles.  That would be easier for readers who are interested in digging into the original documents themselves.   Nonetheless, I think that this book gave a very clear view of one of the saddest event ever happened in human history in a way that can be understood by general public.  <br />I strongly disagreed with one of the reader's review for criticizing this book as \\"ridiculous\\".  The reasons for my disagreement are as followed:<BR>1.  Criticizing Point:  <BR>\\"Iris Chang is a fourth-Generation Chinese American. She does not speak or understand any of the languages needed to examine this issue (Chinese, Japanese and German). I have concluded that all information used in this book is second-hand information, most of them is propaganda.\\"<br />Disagreement:  <BR>First of all, there are a lot of first hand references written in English, as were listed in the book.  In fact, one of the reasons that Nanking Massacre was known to the world was because quite a few Europeans and Americans happened to witness and documented the event.   If the reviewer considered none of those documents are first-hand documents, I am not sure what the definition of \\"first-hand\\" information is.   In addition, some of the documents are even reported by Japanese themselves.  It is not reasonable to report something against their own country if it is not truth, especially during the war time.<br />Second, according to what the author stated in the book, the author is a second generation Chinese American (not a very important point here, but it implies the reviewer may not read the book clearly before jumping into conclusion).  In her book she thanks her parents and many other people for helping her translating needed documents from different languages.  Many of these helpers are scholars with knowledge of multi-languages.  Take her parent as an example, they were born in Mainland China, grew up in Taiwan and received their Ph.D.s from Harvard University in American.  Is it reasonable to believe that they have enough knowledge in both Chinese and English to translating some of those documents for her?   <br />2. Criticizing Point:  <BR>The reviewer stated: \\"My great uncle was in the Japanese Army. He told me several times not to believe in this kind of nonsense. It is impossible to kill so many people in such a short period. Especially with soldiers who were not equipped with machine guns or other weapons for mass-destruction. Just take a minute and think. According to my uncle, it took almost 3 days to burn 6 corpses of his comrades after an attack. How long will it take to burn 300.000 corpses?\\"<br />Disagreement:<BR>First, it maybe true to take 3 days to completely burn 6 bodies.  However, we were not talking about cremation ceremony here.  We were talking about burn to death.  How many minutes can a human being endure before he or she was burn to death?    Thanks heaven it is not 3 days!!  Besides, if the reviewer had read through the book (or any other documents), not all 300,000 corpses were burn, a lot of them were buried or dumped into river.  Please read the book before jump into conclusion and make such a harsh criticism.<br />Second, Japanese soldier did have machine gun.  Of course not as powerful as the modern model, but they did have machine gun.  Japanese did not start the war un-prepared.   Besides, how difficult it is to kill civilians (especially elderly, small children and babies) who have no weapon at all?    It did not even need weapons for mass-destruction.  In addition, if one likes to play the number, here it is:  The number of the Japanese troop invaded Nanking was around 50, 000.   The peak of the ciaos was around 6 to 8 weeks.  The conservative estimation of casualty is from 260, 000 to 350,000 during that period.  Do the math yourself!  See how possible it is!   I have to emphasize that it is not my intension to use these numbers to prove the Massacre did occurred, that would be too shaky.  The real evidences were presented in the book and the documents it referred.  I merely use these numbers here to show that one can not use these numbers to claim it is not possible that the Massacre occurred.<br />Third, though I have no intension to dishonor anybody's ancestor, I have to point out that the credential of reviewer's great uncle's words is really questionable for the following reasons:<br />Scenario 1:  His great uncle was in Nanking with the Japanese army while the Massacre occurred.  Then it is possible he participated in the crime (thought may not be voluntarily, I hope).  It is a common sense that one can not use the words from the accused as objective evidence.  Especially when he or she is denying the crime accused.<br />Scenario 2:  His great uncle was not in Nanking while the Massacre occurred.  Then all he knew about the event were from the propaganda in the army, which by all means could only be more misleading than any outside propaganda.<br />One question I would like to ask here: how many casualties qualify it as a massacre?  Even if it is propaganda, even if only 10% or even 1% of the reports were true, it is still a horrible crime.  Besides, Nanking Massacre was such a crime not only for the number of civilian casualty, but also the cruel way the victims were killed.  Think about it, if one of the women, just ONE, that were tortured, raped, before they were killed were your own mother, wife or daughter, could anyone just shrug and say \\"it is ridiculous, it is just propaganda....\\"?    If one of the victims of the \\"killing game\\" (reported by the Japanese newspaper, not Western or Chinese propaganda) is your own father, brother or son, could anyone just shrug and say \\"it is ridiculous, it is just propaganda....\\"?    <br />A tragedy such as this must not be forgotten if we don't want history repeat itself.   Human being will only advance if we can recognize the mistakes we made and put in effort to prevent it from happening again.
B000002WNP|5.0|The 50's saw many things happen to Elvis. As that decade drew to a close, he got drafted into the Army.  Imagine that happening today to say Kurt Cobain, maybe he'd still be around. The 60's saw Elvis making movies,getting married and bringing the beautiful Lisa Marie into the world with help from Pricilla.  The British Invasion inspired many to great heights, Motown and Stax churned out hit after hit.  Elvis reclaimed his throne in this decade. Some say it took the 1968 TV Special. I say he never really went away.  Some of his most famous hits are from this period.  Here are some of my favorites featured in this box set: It's Now or Never, Such A Night, Are You Lonesome Tonight,Surrender,I'm Coming Home,I Feel So Bad,Judy,That's Someone You Never Forget,His Latest Flame,Little Sister,Good Luck Charm,You'll Be Gone,Suspicion,She's Not You,Tomorrow is a Long Time,Just Call Me Lonesome,U.S.Male,Big Boss Man,Guitar Man,LongBlack Limosine,From A Jack To A King & Suspicious Minds just to name a few. ** The Essential 60's Volume Two has many great MOVIE TUNES such as Can't Help Fallin' in Love,Flaming Star,Follow That Dream,King of the Whole Wide World,Return to Sender,Viva Las Vegas,Bossa Nova Baby & One Broken Heart For Sale!**  I hope you'll enjoy it.
0380789035|4.0|Loved it! In a world of Tolkien clones, and never ending cash cow 'epics' it is oh so refreshing to find a truly intellectual fantasy novel. Gaiman has created a novel that the well read individual can read and not feel like they are induldging in the equivalent of a fast food burger. People like Goodkind satasify that certain craving, but you feel vaguley ill after finishing it. American Gods, though, is an incredibly original, intelligent, involving story. Anyone who ever studied world mythology, enjoys sociological observations that are, at time, incredibly enlightening, and likes to read an enjoyable novel needs to check this one out.
B00004VW5A|5.0|I'll let the song titles alone justify the purchase:1954 saw Elvis cut That's All Right, Blue Moon, Just Because &amp; Good Rockin' Tonight; in 1955, Elvis dropped  the following tunes on the world:You're Right, I'm Left, She's Gone/Mystery Train/I Forgot to Remember to Forget; Elvis 1956: Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Suede Shoes, Hound Dog, Don't Be Cruel,Love Me Tender, My Baby Left Me,Love Me, When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again; The King in 1957 recorded Jailhouse Rock,Teddy Bear,I Beg of You, One Night, You're So Square, Blue Christmas,Treat Me Nice,Loving You &amp; Got Alot of Livin' to Do. Before entering the Army, Elvis was able to record A Big Hunk O'Love in 1958.  Now I am just listing some of my picks from a great collection of tunes that no record collector should be without.  Do the right thing and pick this up.  Thank you very much.
038533348X|5.0|Quite possibly my favorite book.  The humor, the wit, the messages with the ability to make you (me) cry.  My unworthy words cannot describe.  Just READ IT.
6305265666|5.0|This has been my favorite movie (not counting my many anime favorites) since it came out. <BR>Cinderella was never my favorite fairy tale, but none-the-less, this is quite a find. Actress, Barrymore does a terrific job, and Houston is the ideal evil stepmother! The Leonardo Divinchi twist was wonderful. I don't know how many times I have watched this, but it is a good movie and I guarantee you, you will NOT be dissapointed, especailly if you love a good sappy time period romance ^.~
0792156684|5.0|This movie won the best picture some years ago and got about 10 Oscars. It's a very romantic with a kinda sad ending at the end. The soundtrack is awesome too. I've watched it on DVD for too many times. Gotta have it for collection. I bet you won't disappoint it.
0316666343|2.0|This book was truly stupid.  The disintegration of the family theme following the murder of a child is an interesting one - but the \\"device\\" of the girl looking down from heaven didn't work for me - it was just too stupid.  Sorry I can't suspend my disbelief, but I can't believe this is at the top of the best sellers' list...
6304143184|5.0|E.T. is unquestionably among the top films ever made. It's hard to describe its unique appeal - it does not stem from any one aspect of the film in particular, but more from the overall spell of innocence, wonder, and magic the movie weaves. Perhaps E.T. is best described as a modern fairy tale of sorts. But regardless of what one calls it, E.T. is a movie everyone should see at least once - in an era of slickly made commercial films, it is a rare thing - for it is a blockbuster that actually deserves its ongoing popularity because of the real sentiment that runs through it.<br />As most people know, E.T. is the story of the encounter between a lost alien and a young boy, who is also lost in a world where, he has discovered, adults no longer believe in anything. Spielberg uses the story, which is very compelling, to create some of the most memorable moments on film - ranging from the humorous to the genuinely touching. For instance, scenes such as the bicycle ride or E.T.'s departure.<br />Anyhow, this is a wonderful film - for those of you who haven't seen it (probably not many) you really should! It's a great, heartwarming story that did indeed move the world, and it is perfect for children. See this and enjoy a magical classic!
0380002930|5.0|Nothing short of a masterpiece, \\"Watership Down\\" does for the English countryside what \\"The Jungle Books\\" did for the Indian jungles - and, like \\"The Jungle Books\\", should first be read in pre-adolescence but becomes even more profound upon rereading as an adult.<br />We are immediately introduced to two of the three major characters of the novel. Fiver, a small rabbit prone to visions of the future, receives a mixed blessing - a horrendous vision of the destruction of his warren, as well as another of a promised land - a land of safety and security. Insistant that the whole warren must be evacuated post haste, he is assisted by his self-assured brother Hazel, who agrees partly because he has lived his whole life watching Fiver's visions come true and partly because he is becoming weary of the warren's inequality and wants a better life for Fiver - and by extension all the other rabbits who will never become members of the elite Owsla and face a rather bleak future. Their mutual admiration and devotion are the emotional center of the story.<br />We are introduced to the handful of rabbits that they are able to convince to defect, most because of Hazel's influence or because they were discontented anyway rather than that they have faith in Fiver's visions at this point. Chief among them is Bigwig, a commanding Owsla member whose support is an unexpected surprise.<br />As the story goes on, they face many natural and man-made perils, reach Fiver's Down, learn the fate of their original warren, attempt to create a just government and attempt to ensure the survival of their new warren by attracting does to immigrate (the original immigrants are all bucks)<br />It all ends in a nailbiting climax in which Bigwig faces the evil fascist General Woundwort, who vows to personally kill him for spearheading a rescue of oppressed does and a buck from his warren; Fiver faces a quieter but no less gripping battle for his spirit when the realm from whence his visions come threatensto overwhelm him; and Hazel makes a desperate bargain with their god Frith, the personification of the sun.<br />It's actually their more subtle traits that make the rabbits - and the book - so fascinating. We admire Bigwig for his bravery, but love him for refusing to attempt to become a dictator and - after a few hard-earned lessons in humility - acknowledging the merits of those superficially weaker than him. We admire Fiver for his courageous stands when he knows he's right - even when at one point it threatens his relationship with Hazel - but love him for his constant struggle just to remain sane in the face of an ability that might be a public treasure but is also an appalling personal tragedy. We admire Hazel for his heroism at Nuthanger Farm but love him for his integrity and political vision. <br />There are moments of humor - particularly involving Bigwig's unusual friendship with a friendly, flamboyant seagull named Kehaar who's a favorite of fans among the supporting characters, but it's the vivid descriptions of the horrors of rabbit life that will haunt you once the novel is done; like the visceral description of the inevitable holocaust that Fiver predicted as well as more subtle terrors such as when Fiver tries to explain to Hazel that he isn't at all sure that the realm from whence his visions come is particularly friendly.<br />An exciting, deep tale that everyone should read at least once.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Generally, Hollywood on Hollywood movies are pretty bad, but Sunset Boulevard is one of the few exceptions. This movie is really as close to perfect as movies can get! In fact, it's even difficult to pinpoint the elements that make it so good, but a few of the highlights include the dark sets, appropriate music, very clever direction by Billy Wilder, and the brilliant performances of Gloria Swanson and William Holden.<br />Sunset Boulevard is the tale of an aging silent-movie queen (Gloria Swanson) who lives locked away in a huge palace, alone except for her butler/chauffeur/former director/ex-husband and her dreams of her former glory. When a financially troubled screenwriter (William Holden) stumbles into her grasp, he is caught by her madness and riches like a fly on flypaper. Although, from the first shot of the movie, one knows how it will all end, like the screenwriter, it is easy to stay enthralled by the darkly chilling power of the story!<br />Anyhow, this is a must-see! It offers many wonderful insights into the world of the Hollywood that was, and the life of those have-beens who were part of, and destroyed by, the star system. Most importantly, however, this noir masterpiece is gripping, entertaining, and still sparkles with wit and sarcasm 52 years after its original release! Enjoy! Just as a sidenote, keep a lookout for some famous people - Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, and others - playing themselves.
B000069HKH|5.0|A fine collection of songs--Perhaps Bruce's best ever.  I really enjoy this CD.  It operates on many levels.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I know that I'll probably end up catching {stuff} from various people that Star Wars is not in the Top Ten of 1999, but tough! I don't think that it deserves to belong there. Yeah, the special effects were great and yes, we've all been waiting years for it, but that doesn't earn it the right to jump to the top. There are several weak story points (I won't spoil it in case you haven't yet seen the film) that take away from the movie. Plus George seems to have been more in love with the CGI characters than he was in the story.<br />For a true story, I think that it is lacking. But I will definitely concede the point that Phantom Menace gets you hyped up for the others. I've had hours of conversations on what can and should happen next, plus what is the best way to pull it off. And I expect to have many more hours. So from an energy point of view, I will have put more energy in to Phantom Menace this year than any other film in a long while.
B0000683DH|5.0|I'm glad I waited to purchase my Trek DVD's--the first set of releases was &quot;bare bones.&quot;  This DVD is chock full o' fun.  Wonderful histrionics from Ricardo Montalban and William Shatner make for a great, melodramatic space opera.  Put it on and have a blast!
B000065U1N|5.0|I do not subscribe to &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, but someone passed me a copy which included Oliver North's review of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (BHD). North gave great praise to it as one of the most realistic war movies he has seen. Of course, he trashed &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (who wouldn't -- okay movie, bad &quot;war&quot; movie). He also gave a bad view of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (SPR). He says that BHD is just like the real thing. His is not the first like that (I know some Special Ops people from the same time period). As for me, I could not say from personal experience, but it sure seems more realistic than the glamorized versions we see. Overall, it was a good movie (worth considering to buy, certainly should rent). I would put it at the same level as SPR.
B00006F7IM|5.0|Finally Major League has come to DVD.  Its about ... time too.  With me loving the 1st one.  wearing out 3 or so VHS tapes, for one of the best baseball movies of all time.  With today an all-star cast with Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Wesley Snipes, and Rene Russo.  This movie has every thing romance, comedy, with a little bad word here and there.  But your kids can still see it.  I pretty much can say all the lines as the movie goes along. Hate it when its on TV and its edited. If I were you I would pick up a copy, I know I am.
B00000DCHI|5.0|For even small collections (less than 100), this CD is a must-have. It has all the major classics and my personal favorite &quot;Captain Jack&quot; (althought it is not recorded very well). Although my favorite Billy Joel album is &quot;The Nylon Curtain&quot; (even Joel gives special attention to it), because of recording quality and songs, the Greatest Hits has some of those and others that everyone knows.
7119005901|4.0|Let us start with the edition.  I am talking here about the paperback Foreign Language Press, Beijing edition tanslated by Moss Roberts.  You will find his name on the back of the title page spelled Roborts.  This common problem with proofing will be a minor irritant in some cases and a major snafu in others--in places parts of sentances are dropped.<BR>     In spite of the need for an English speaker to go over the galleys, this translation is the one to buy.  If you want to dip into the Brewitt-Tuttle translation set your browser to Romance of the Three Kingdoms; you will find a slightly modified version on the web.  Robert's version is superior in style, and the translator tries to help reader out by regularizing all character names.<BR>     This edition provides useful helps to the reader maps, illustrations, a list of principal characters, and notes.  The notes are at the end of each volume, a foolish modern practice. So if you want to really understand the text you will need to do a lot of flipping back and forth.<BR>      Reading this novel can be compared to diving into the Iliad for the first time, many strange names and some reoccuring formulaic action.  The resemblance to any Western epic is only superficial.  The basic plot line is episodic with sometimes long exposition punctuated by vivid episodes.  It is a story of war and political intrigue, and like the Iliad women figure in as victims or calculating sex objects (interesting ones) that lead men to their doom.  Political correctness in The Three Kingdoms is from a different time and culture.<BR>     I find the whole tale superb, but I first read the Iliad when I was nine so figure that into your judgement. If traditional literature fascinates you buy, but be ready for four volumes much tougher than Tolkien, David Weber, Laurell K. Hamilton, Harry Turtledove, or Mary Gentle to mention a few writers of modern multi-volume series approaching the magnitude of The Three Kingdoms.<BR>     Finally, The Three Kingdoms is \\"literature\\" and if that genre scares you, stay away.
0060392886|5.0|This is an amazing book.  Lots of stuff that I never ever knew.  And We thought we knew the Crue.  Not even a little.  This book goes from the crue being kids to present.  Very very good read.  Ive read it twice. I cried when Vince was talking about Skylar.  Worth every penny.
B000002KNI|5.0|I have seen this concert many times on cable, and own it on VHS, and every time I watch it, I wonder why Paul Simon has rejected his early work as not being worthy of his talent?  The lyrics and music make me cry and laugh and  sing along  every time!
B00004NRWH|5.0|This album is sweet!  How could you not like this if you're into rock?  Every song is solid.  They have some sweet ol' solos on this cd.  This is an awesome rock album, if you like that rock n' roll stuff.
B00003CXWV|5.0|This is an excellent movie in many respects. The perspective is certainly original: it talks about drugs from the point of a drug dealer. He (Johnny Depp - great performance) starts as a small marihuana dealer in California, just to smell the big business changing to harder stuff.<br />I would show this film to kids to show them the brutal world of drug dealers. The message is that even if you think you have friends and you are on top of everything, it is only an illusion that changes very quickly.<br />Go buy it. You will watch it more than twice.
0312265859|4.0|If you are hooked on the Stephanie Plum novels, you've probably already read Hard Eight.  If you are considering buying it as a foray into the world of Evanovich's brassy Jersey girl bounty hunter, do yourself a favor and start earlier in the series.<br />While Stephanie's mad cap exploits made me laugh, I found some of the situations to be over-the-top ridiculous.  I agree with the reviewer who wonders how, and why, Stephanie has not only not improved her bounty hunting skills, but has gotten worse!  I love Stephanie, but she does seem to be getting dumber (maybe it's the Jersey water or too many hairspray fumes!).  Not that she should ever become too apt at apprehending FTA's, but a little improvement would be nice.  She has often said that she doesn't make the same mistake twice, but that no longer seems to be the case.  The sudden coldness between Stephanie and Morelli was also off-putting, as well as the near obsession with Ranger.<br />Of course, I will read number 9 when it comes out, but I might not be so quick to buy it on the day it is released.
0688170528|5.0|What a great book ! If I could I would give it 10*. <BR>This is the story of Emily & Chris, it is their love story, yet in the first pages Emily dies, Chris lives...a suicide pact ? or murder ?  Chris & Emily seem to have everything any 17 year old would want plus loving parents that are also best friends, so what went wrong ? <BR>The author Jodi Picoult does a beautiful job, she switches from ''Then'' to ''Now'' in order to go back in time and find the answers to try and make sense of it all. These two families are facing a crisis and each one of them deals with it in their own way. Their lives become complicated and unbalanced. This is how friendships can be so easily broken. Nothing is ever black or white...what pressure teenagers impose on themselves or do we as parents impose on them ?  The story deals with so many questions...the writing is strong and passionate. Do parents really know their children ? Do they talk to them enough ?  Can loving someone be enough to justify a suicide pact or even a murder ? How far will parents go to protect their children or even to protect themselves ? Can suicide be the only answer ?<BR>The author paints a deeply moving picture of strong emotions... disbelief, sorrow, pain, guilt, fear, hate, a gripping tale that concludes in an anticipated court drama... the suspense is almost unbearable. I could not put this book down, the characters will stay with me for a long time.
0575056975|4.0|Mort is an awkward boy who is trying to understand about the world.  He is chosen to be an apprentice by none other than Death.  This is amusing considering that a translation of \\"morte\\" is death.  This is a fairly typical coming-of-age fantasy with quite a bit of humor.<br />Terry Pratchett sets the bulk of the novel in his Discworld, which is held on the back of a giant turtle.  If you have never read any of the Discworld books, don't worry, you will not be lost here.  If you are not a fan of Monty Python/British humor, then you might not get all the jokes and puns.  Also, you might not understand why so much is spent on cabbage.<br />The story is solid.  Although the journey of Mort towards manhood is not linear, there are no gaps in the narrative.  The flow keeps you involved in the story from beginning to end.  I would recommend reading this for a laugh.
B0000640VN|4.0|If there is one thing I can't stand in Hollywood is the type-casting that takes place. Examples? Jim Carey, Robin Williams, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro...and of course Meg Ryan. I wish I could blame the actors for not taking on challenges, but I really can't because if I were offered millions of dollars to make the movie, I would not have been able to turn them down. With this said, this is an okay movie. Although it resembles several of more recent Meg Ryan movies (You've got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, French Kiss, IQ need I say more) it still set's itself aside as a pretty good movie. Question for all ya'll what happened to the days of The Doors, When a Man loves a Woman or even When Harry met Sally? Those days when Meg Ryan was much more diverse in her acting. No offense to the marvelous Meg Ryan, I think she could handle any acting job put in front of her. I blame the movie makers, producers, screen writers that make these movies that are 'perfect' for Meg Ryan. <br />Okay I'm off my soapbox. Sorry <br />Kate and Leopold is about time travel, love and chivalry.  Wierd combination? Absolutley, so let me summarize. Kate played by Meg Ryan, is a modern day woman who has had problems with relationships, and is currently trying to deal with her most recent break up in addition to getting a promotion from a boss that apparently just wants some action. So needless to say she is currently struggling with her faith in the opposite sex. Her recent ex-boyfriend, Stuart, is a scientist played by Liev Schreiber, who has found a tear in the space time continuem, yeah I know it sounds like something out of Star Trek but that's what it is. While traveling through time Stuart accidentally brings his great-great-great grandfather Leopold back to the future with him. For some unknown and unexplained reason, Leopold can't go back in time until the next week and is forced to spend that time in modern day New York. During this time he meets and falls in love with Kate (Ryan).  What'seven more surprising is that Kate also falls for the chivalrous Leopold who stands when she leaves a table and insists on chaperoning her dates.  Well before he knows it the time has come for him to go back, will he go is now the question?
6301955293|5.0|Set in a small town in Texas, this movie examines becoming an adult and sexual mores.  The entire film is shot in black and white, which adds a kind of authenticity to it.<br />The are great performances, early in their careers, by Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd.  Shepherd's role of Jacey, the young debutante, is convincing.  The expression of her face speaks volumes.  Another great performance was from Cloris Leachman, whom I had always thought of as a comedic actress.<br />There is not a lot to do in this small town, and everyone knows what everyone else is doing.  There are a pool hall, a restaurant, and a theater, but there is not much else beyond that.  The characters find themselves pressed against the only choices they have as they all struggle for some kind of escape.<br />This movie is well worth watching.  I would highly recommend it.
B00005IC2H|3.0|Very reminiscent of early Spiritualized (`laser guided melodies') as well as `religious' Krautrockers like Ash Ra Tempel, this record goes after a similar narcotic transcendence. At the same time, Sigur Ros seem influenced by the emotionally heightened holy minimalism of a Part or Gorecki. The music certainly sounds impressive: it seems to throw just the right shape - a cathedral-sized orchestral miasma, oceanic and static, but detailed: blissed-out, sunblinded, and rushing. However, what something sounds like does not necessarily make it the real thing, and with familiarity it becomes clear that shape-throwing is all that's really going on. Agaetis Byrjun is the sound of talented but pomped-out youngsters attempting Great Art, but lacking the emotional or experiential resources: the tradition this really comes out of is middle-class winebar downtempo, not isolationist spiritual searching or counter-culture despair. Tastefully done but quickly grating, Sigur Ros's first international release is way too heavy on rhetoric. Rock-literate posing rather than expressing what you really know and feel is increasingly what popular music is about, and sadly this record goes down as a classic example.
0790732017|5.0|There is a version with a documentary of the making of the movie.  If you can see that version, I highly recommend it.  The writer of the novel, and the person on whom the story is based, walks through the set and is telling someone what it was like in the real prison.<br />The movie itself is Steve McQueen.  Dustin Hoffman turns in a great performance as the counterfeiter, but you can't escape feeling awed by the character played by Steve McQueen.  Not matter what hardship or pressure is put on him, they can not break him.  You will find yourself wishes he would give up to stop the torture but are proud when he refuses to break.<br />The film does not cover whether Papillon was innocent or guilty.  He states two or three times that he is innocent, but they never really discuss it.  The focus is on his struggle for escape.  The idea that he might be guilty nags at you making you wonder whether you should cheer for his escape or not.<br />This is a great movie and I would highly recommend seeing it.
B000002G7E|1.0|Spoken words, horrible singing, and the... overhyped Sister Ray. I very much like some VU, Sonic Youth, Nirvana, The Pixies and other bands not considered mainstream. But this is not music. It is a joke, however. Anyone with the least degree of objectivity can't think this is good. It is painful to sit through. Put on a good Beatles, Stones, or Miles Davis album, then listen to this noise. It doesn't hold up. There's no talent in the grooves. I guess this is supposed to be some sort of avant-garde or alternative experiment. If so, then it is nothing more than a guise for people without talent doing something different that is labeled as cool or groundbreaking, but in reality smacks of incompetence.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Boring and pointless.  I normally avoid movies with Drew Barrymore in them and I wish I'd avoided this one.  Don't waste your time or your money.
B00005JGAB|4.0|A great album from a very influential band. But lets face it, all the songs pretty much sound the same. Influence is overrated. New Kids on the Block were influential, being the precursor to most of the insidious garbage on the airwaves today. So what? Ultimately, the music has to stand on its own merits, and I think the Ramones definitely do that. However, I can't listen to this again and again like I could with Chuck Berry's St. Louis to Liverpool or Exile on Main Street from The Rolling Stones. Someone said this music should be put in a time capsule to represent American music. Not at all. Gershwin, Armstrong, Davis, Sinatra, Ellington, and Dylan would be given that distinction. The Ramones are good, but they don't even come close to scaling those heights. If you think they do, then you may have been sniffing some glue.
0316776963|5.0|humorous, disrespectful, politically incorrect, joyously cynical, and insightful into the psychopathologies of everyday existence.<br />In other words, my kind of book! Highly recommended for a raucous good time.
B00000892G|5.0|Until i got this album i had The Marriage of Heaven and Hell 1 and 2 and The House of Atreus 1 and 2. Invictus is an amazing album, with a powerful guitar sound and more metal in it than other releases, and David Defeis is very attacking but also mellow in slower parts. If you wanted to hear the definitive VS album , this is it. One of my favourite cds out of my 250 cd collection.
B00005KB9T|5.0|In 1972, The Wailers set out, working on Catch a Fire, the album was sent to london, and had some overdubs on the tracks, but all the tracks are excellent, it's The Wailers best work, released almost 30 years ago, the album still goes strong, being one of the best albums ever, and the best Wailers album ever. It was distributed to an international market, and The Wailers started to tour the UK and United States in 1973 with their rebel sound and image. Being their 3rd album overall, Catch a Fire wasn't quickly popular, but as you listen, the tight \\"Concrete Jungle\\", \\"Slave Driver\\", \\"400 Years\\", \\"Rock it Baby\\", \\"Stir it Up\\", \\"Kinky Reggae\\", and all the others gave The Wailers a step over everyone else, showing they were from a third world enviroment, but showing they knew what they were doing.
B000067JBN|2.0|This movie started out pretty interesting, however it ended up not being a good movie. the music was beautiful and the scenary was nice, but the storyline was confusing and not good at all. This movie seems like it was thrown together. And it should have been longer. How many times must I say that there is no such thing as a good hour and a half action movie.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is a GREAT movie. This flick will keep you on the edge of your seat! This is one of those movies that you are wondering what is going to happen next in. Jim Caviezel and Dennis Quaid did a wonderful job in this movie. I think I could watch this movie over and over again, each time I notice something new! I definately recommend buying this movie.
B00005NW02|5.0|I'm a local from L.A. and have seen System Of A Down in little clubs in Hollywood before the huge outbreak of their music. I love them and will always. <BR>  If there is a void in your life and need some filling, this will do it. I promise. It's hard and original, it's not something the record label is trying to push to make tons of money... this album doesn't need that.<BR> It's a well balanced CD with everything you need for every mood. They always had the power to do that, and I don't think that will ever change. If you are wondering if you should pick this up or not, my adivce would be.... Pick it up!
B00004Z459|5.0|i love all the song here lik papercut and runaway plus in the end &quot; i love when the band sings,the songs really speak to me maybe it well to u!!! LINKIN PARK RULLLLEEESSSSS 4 EVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0449002128|5.0|This latest installment from Silva is his best.  I read it over the course of 2 days, and if you are a Ludlum fan, you'll love this book.  The present context in which this book takes place is strikingly fitting, and the depth to which Silva researched before writing this book is very apparent. This book gives a somewhat accurate account of the Israeli secret service, and provides accounts of stories that have been told be real-world defectors. If one is looking for an ultra-fast read, this is your book.
B00004Z459|5.0|i think this cd is the bomb u can hear it any time when ur angry like the song &amp;quot;runaway&amp;quot; these guyz r the coolest band ever i love the lead singer!!!the crazy one with the hair dyied blond!! hes so cute iwonder if he has a gurlfriend??
B00004NHCC|5.0|I've had this CD over a year now and every time and every time I listen to Sarah, I swear she sounds better each time.  This is one hell of a recording.  Clifford Brown stands out for all eternity on trumpet.  You have to wonder what a star he would have been.  Herbie Mann on flute is decent too.  This is great CD during a wonderful time in the 50's before music met effects processing and over production!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Like any true child of the 80's, the Goonies holds a special place in my heart.  It's a rare person of a certain age who wouldn't immediately know what you were talking about if you said the words \\"One Eyed Willie\\" to them.<br />In these days of CGI special effects, increasing violence, and sadly, decreasing innocence in children, a film like The Goonies is a real gem.  It's a classic Good-versus-Evil yarn, where even the Evil isn't really all that bad.  And what's more, it showed us that a bunch of goofy kids like us could take on big business & organised crime, and win.<br />In the Goonies we join Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk and Co. on an adventure to find the lost treasure of the pirate One Eyed Willie, which, bless 'em, they want so that they can rescue their home town from being razed to the ground by greedy developers.  This film is more or less an Indiana Jones for kids, with some brilliant \\"booby twaps\\" and many genuinely funny moments.<br />This DVD isn't avilable in Region 2 encoding until Septemer (2002), and I'm just short of marking off the days on my calendar til it's released.
B000002LBH|5.0|An astonishing collection of just about every type of Smiths track you could name (singles, b-sides, album tracks, BBC Sessions - and more), Louder Than Bombs is essential both for fanatics (for all of its rare material, much of which is unavailable elswehere), and for neophytes (this collection is a nice overview of a good cross section of their work, and includes many of their best songs.) When discussing The Smiths, one doesn't need to go into the various merits of the individual tracks: The Smiths never recorded a bad song. Indeed, this album contains what are even occasionally considered to be the band's two &quot;bad&quot; tracks: a cover of Twinkle's Golden Lights, which, while certainly being a low point for the band, is listenable and does have its merits; and the instrumental Oscillate Wildly, which I think is a very great and beautiful song - I have no idea why it often gets a bad rap. On the other hand, of course, are the many excellent tracks - from essential tracks to wonderful b-sides. Whatever your particular wont, if you like The Smiths at all, this album belongs in your collection. If you are a casual fan, I reccommend getting this album over its British counterpart, The World Won't Listen, as this album contains all but four songs that that collection does, and its exclusive ones are all available on regular issue Smiths studio albums.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is epic story of man and nature. It shows the struggle of both man and nature to survive, and protect their kin. Nature and humanity have been at it for a while now, and they both have a strong hate for each other, blind of any sympathy or out look for a positive future with each other. This world changes suddenly when a wounded warrior travels west to find a cure, after he kills a possessed boar, and part of the demon slowly grows on him. This demon is fueled by hate. When he travels to the West and see this war going on, all he sees is hate. He says his goal is to &quot;see with eyes free of hate&quot;...only then will he be cured. What he does is befriends both the humans and animals, getting caught between them trying to help his new friends. It doesn't seem to work as they both push him out and tell him to stay away &quot;traitor&quot;. But when things turn to the worse, there he is to try to save both nature and man from ultimate destruction and teach the way of love. The ending is nothing short of amazing. This is an amazing tale that all should see (if you are old enough to see depiction's of battle and gore), that shows you how nothing good happens when you hate each other, and only want the other dead. And of course the animation is some of the best, in the field. Every scene has such minute detail and fluidity. The only negative spot its extras aren't great. But this is not a dvd you want to get for the extras, its the epic, story that sends a positive message to this world which is going through so many hardships. Its not just about man destroying nature, its more universal, about any two groups destroying each other. Put this on and watch a quality animation film, that's more than the everyday Saturday cartoons.
B000002KDI|5.0|The mid to late 70's, especially after the unexpected mega-success of Frampton Comes Alive, saw the release of literally hundreds of self-indulgent live rocks albums, from almost every major act. Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse's Live Rust is one of the very best of the bunch. Coming at the end of a decade in which Neil Young had released some of the best rock albums ever recorded, this way an appropriate way to cap off many years of fruitful artistic excursions for him - by releasing an album of his songs as they are best: in front of an audience. At the time, this album seemed a bit redundant: in the previous year, Young had released a retrospective of his work (Decade), and, only four months previous, had released a live album of new studio tunes - four of which are repeated here. However, in hindsight, and taken as it is now, this album can be commended for what it truly is: one of the best live rock albums ever released. This hits most of the high points of Neil Young's career up to that point: from many of his acoustic hits (which he performs solo) - I Am A Child, Comes A Time, and a touching solo piano version of After The Gold Rush; as well as the second half of the album, which consists of searing electric rock jams with Crazy Horse on many of Young's best guitar rockers: Cinnamon Girl, Cortez The Killer, and definitive versions of Like A Hurricane and Tonight's The Night. And, while it's true that four songs from Rust Never Sleeps are repeated here, these are all absolute classics, and one is not bound to complain - besides, there are subtle differences between the version on here and the ones on that album, which will be appreciated by the hard-core. Highly, highly reccommended.
6305014140|3.0|The plot is very simple. A wandering ninja (Jubei) is forced to help find out why a village comes under an epidemic, and ends up discovering some very weird supernatural things. Such as an old enemy coming back to life somehow, and working with demons! Well, what essentially happens is Jubei has to find and stop his enemy (with the help of a small govt. spy, and a Ninja Girl), but before he can do that, he has to defeat the demons. Each demon has different powers and skills. One has stone like skin. Another cannot see, but has super hearing. Another has the power of lightning. Finally at the end he discovers why the village had an epidemic and what actually is going on. Throw in very cool action battles, a growing love story, and realized characters, and you have a fun hour and a half. A second watching might be more enjoyable, when you know everything that happens. After that its not very much watchable, except for the battles. The drawing and sound is superb. As extras you have a detailed synopsis, and character bio's, a trailer, and some quick footage of other anime's from this company. All in all, if your a fan of anime, battles, and tales of ninjas you will enjoy this. I will warn you though the film is filled with violence, and has some explicit sexual situations. If that bothers you in any way, you should stay away at all costs. So I give this 3 stars, its a nice tale, but isn't all that fun after your 2nd viewing. Rent first. Hope this helps!

0316666343|5.0|I'm not even finished reading this book and I love it!  Because it's told through the eyes of Susie from heaven, it's as heart- wrenching as it is insightful.  Anyone who's lost a loved one, be it a person or a beloved pet, can relate to what Susie's family and friends are going through, as well as see through their own lost loved one's eyes.  This book takes you through all possible emotions- sadness, anger, nostalgia- and back again, without missing a beat!
B000068PQ0|5.0|First Listen: This is the most confounding thing I've ever heard. It's about this metaphorical fight against evil pink robots, for the first four songs. Then it changes direction and all the songs are about death and regret. This isn't as good as The Soft Bulletin. I don't know about this one. I should probably listen to it again.<br />Second Listen: Well it's better than I initially thought. I really like \\"Ego Tripping At The Gates Of Hell.\\" That one got my attention. And that acoustic guitar tweek on \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots (Part 1) is pretty nifty. But it still seems like the second half of the album is kinda weak. \\"Do You Realize??\\" just flat out sounds overdone.<br />Third Listen: Wow. This is pretty good. <br />Fourth Listen: This is really, really good. I can't get these songs out of my head. They are so well-crafted. They are beautiful. They are powerful. Wow. I've gotta listen to it again.<br />Fifth Listen: Nice. <br />Sixth Listen: \\"Do You Realize??\\" is outstanding. But hey, let's face it folks, this album is amazing, from beginning to end.<br />Seventh Listen: Awesome.<br />Eighth Listen: Incredible. \\"I'll get you Yoshimi!\\"<br />Ninth Listen: I can't stop listening to this album.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|but it's his performance that makes this movie.  A Beautiful Mind is an engaging film.  Not a great movie, but a very good one.  As has become rather expected in movies by the &quot;better&quot; American directors, the ending is pure schmaltz.  I presume studio pressure had a lot to do with it--which is an excuse that is unavailable to Mr. Speilberg, who has transformed himself into the king of schmaltzy endings.  But, I digress.<br />Part of Crowe's approach to acting is to notice and replicate certain &quot;tics&quot; that become the nucleus around which his performance can spin, react, and coalesce.  But, unlike many lesser actors, these &quot;tics&quot; do not devolve into cliches.  He uses them as windows into the character's soul.  Here, John Nash's fingers do a figure eight on his forehead when the stress around him builds.  It's as if he is both shielding himself from the world and also wishing away demons with some arcane incantation.  Crowe's portrait of a man transformed by events beyond his control should have earned him an Oscar.  This truly was the performance of the year, and not a throwaway like Crowe's performance in the mediocre Gladiator.  But, apparently, he was even too rude and boorish for Hollywood (which is saying something when major stars can still win Oscars after attacking people with golf clubs).<br />Jennifer Connolly won an oscar for her role, but I'm not quite sure why.  Her performance is adequate, but the role is thin and her range of emotion is merely ordinary.  There is one scene where she is driven into a rage of frustration, shattering a mirror in the process, but that is the only shining moment for her.<br />Now if we can only get Mr. Howard to get off the schmaltzy ending train ...

One that either makes you want to go on or toss the book to the other end of the room. A sentence that not only will elaborate how Susie was murdered, but why, how, and digs inside the murderer's sick, dememted mind.  <br />Alice Sebold gently pushes us into a place too unbearable and indescribable to be.<BR>An abduction. A rape. A murder.<br />We smell his breath and the dampness of dirt.  Feel his blubbery lips.<br />\\"Please, dont. Please. Please. Please.\\"  Franny told me everyone begged please before dying---\\"Lovely Bones---<br />Fourteen year old Susie narrates from heaven.  (A giant playground of swings.)  She sees her mother and father mourning, breaking apart.  Her sister pulling away from the world.  But her little brother talks to her.  She sees the murderer sitting in the dark...staring out the window towards the school-grounds.<BR>She watches her life go on...She watches people grow older as she should be. She holds on to earth.<br />Some of the images in 'Lovely bones' are beautiful.  Like when somebody dies Susie feels their soul brushing against her cheek...Or when the family dog dies Susie wonders if she'll see him in heaven and suddely he runs up to her, full force, knocking her down.<br />This book is not just about pain and loss and the reality of abduction.  It is about healing and finally, finally in the end...<BR>Going on.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is the best, \\"best\\" CD that I have heard in a long time.  The combination of her smooth voice and music, she is going to be around for a long time, so get used to her name and sound, you are going to be listening to it for quite some time. Two thumbs up!
B00005YW4H|4.0|A very lovely voice, soft and soothing, with a degree of range but hardly something that can be categorized as jazz. I'm not big on labels but I don't think Norah Jones is exactly in the league of Diana Krall, Karrin Allyson or even Jane Monheit for that matter. To compare her tone to Nina Simone or Billy Holiday is laughable. Don't get me wrong I like this disc and listen to it often and enjoy it for what it is , a nice new voice on the pop scene, a little more sophisticated than most and sounding very good for her age. I think she can develop into a jazz vocalist but she is not there yet .There are a few songs that are on the fringe of being considered jazz but her influences sound more like Maria Muldaur, Rickie Lee Jones or Joni Mitchel in her jazzy excursions.  The title track &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, &quot;Cold, Cold Heart &quot; and &quot;Nightingale&quot; are about as close as it gets to jazz, all of which are excellent . Her music is like bedroom music with the girl next door, then again I've never had such a fine looking neighbor. Good stuff to listen to for a mellow mood enhancer that is a mixture of acoustic jazzy instrumentation and a twangy-bedroom countryish voice. If you want to hear a promising young rising star buy this album, it is almost guaranteed you'll like it. Highly recommended now and for those that expect  more good things to come in the future from the daughter of Ravi Shankar.

0385503954|4.0|Ian McEwan's Atonement has the feel of classical literature:  an elegant and slightly formal style, generous details, and a straightforward plot.  Briony Tallis, a spoiled British 13 year old, spies her older sister Cecilia and the caretaker's son Robbie as they wrestle with an antique vase next to a fountain. Although Briony imagines herself as mature, she does not yet have an adult understanding of the world.  When the events that follow do not fit her scope of comprehension, she forces them into place with a lie that forever changes the people she involves. The novel follows the principals through the war and ends as Briony faces her own mortality in 1999.<br />Especially during the first part (there are four) which takes place just before World War II, I could not help thinking of Henry James and his intricate exploration of character and relationships.  I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading a contemporary novel. The only aspect that jarred me into the 21st century was McEwan's use of metafiction (fiction about writing fiction.)  Briony is an aspiring writer when the story begins, but we are told almost from the start that she will become an accomplished novelist. Throughout, Briony is keenly aware of the demands of her craft and how they distort the truth.  As the novel progresses, the reader is made more and more aware of this self-conscious side until the end, when the final section deals with this issue alone.<br />Personally, I'm tired of metafiction and find it contrived; however, McEwan's polished writing atones for this literary sin.  The details of life both before and during the war are extraordinary, as are the intricate characterizations. Although parts of this novel are overdone, it is McEwan's expertness that triumphs.<br />Atonement is a fine book that deserves widespread attention. I recommend this book for serious readers and those who yearn for more classicism in contemporary literature. You'll want to skip this novel, however, if you don't have the patience for detail or are looking for a suspenseful or complicated plot., if you don't have the patience for detail or are looking for a suspenseful or complicated plot.

I've tried at least half of the recipes in the book and each one has been a success (including the Mexican Wedding Cakes which another reviewer had trouble with...)<BR>Berenbaum gives the reader several options for measuring the ingredients (ex., some people like to measure flour in a measuring cup, others prefer to weigh it on a scale) and options for mixing the dough (ie., mixer or food processor).  Read through a few recipes and you'll quickly see how she organizes the process and how you can choose your preferred method.

6305291446|4.0|One heck of alot better than 3-6, not as good as 2, and Resurrection can't even hold a match to it. I liked it. It would have been a good way to end the series... but the producers see the green, not the films. I guess we can try again at killing Michael Myers....
B00003CXRM|5.0|I am not a Coen brothers fan.  I loathed &quot;Fargo,&quot; and got only a chuckle or two out of &quot;Raising Arizona.&quot;  &quot;O, Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is an entirely different matter, though.  The art direction, production design, and set design all perfectly capture the ambiance of Mississippi in the 1930s, and the casting, from George Clooney on down to the smallest roles, is superb.  It is fanciful, funny, and sometimes even touching.  I think this film is already a comedy classic.  And then, of course, there is the music.  The soundtrack has become a hit in its own right.  Bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley has found himself to be a minor celebrity at the age of 75 because of it.  Use your imagination, sit back, relax, and enjoy,  for it is a rare comedy indeed that works as well as this one.
0316666343|4.0|This is one of the best books I've read. The story was moving, at some points heart wrenching and others hilarious and even frightening, Alice Sebold paints a wonderful though sad world for the readers through Susie's eyes.<BR>What I liked best about it is how both her family and susie had to learn how to let go. The lesson in the book is wonderful.
0380820846|3.0|This romance (Bk 4 in the Bridgerton series) tells us who Lady Whistledown is.  I had the doubtful privilege of realizing that I had guessed correctly in Bk 1 &quot;The Duke and I&quot;.  The hero Colin Bridgerton is the third son, and he is paired up with a wallflower, and an old friend of his sisters (no spoilers here).<br />The couple were perfectly pleasant together, and herein lies the problem.  I really did not feel any sparks between them, unlike the real emotions between Simon and Daphne (Bk 1) or Anthony and Kate (Bk 2).  Colin was this &quot;lost&quot; hero, the superfluous man, the idle aristocrat trying to find his way in life.  He has spent so much of his life running away that he almost fails to notice his true match.<br />The problem was that as cute as the little extracts from Lady Whistledown's colum were, too much was made of the need to keep her identity a secret.  This part of the plot dragged on, and on and on.  There seemed to be very little else to the story, beside this and the efforts of Colin to discover what he wanted for the rest of his life.  I think I prefer a romance with a little more action, or more serious angst.<br />Rating = 3.5 (B-)<BR>Breakdown = romance 3.4 (B-);  writing 3.8 (B);  characterization 3.4 (B-);  plot development 3.2 (C+)
B00003CXB2|5.0|I watched this DVD over the weekend, I think this was the first time I have seen it since I first saw it when it came out in 1962.  I have a Dolby Digital sound system and watched it on a large screen using a video projector, and it was a spectacular treat to watch and hear!  It's unbelievable that this movie was made 40 years ago!  David Lean was truly a master, and this was one of his very best.

B00004TCPJ|5.0|This masterfully remastered version of Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto was given on the 50th anniversary of Russian Pianist<BR>Vladimir Horowitz' American debut. Though not preferred by most critics to his 1951 recording with Reiner and the RCA<BR>Symphony Orchestra, this is by far Horowitz' most polished, emotional and powerful performance - full of cantabile and<BR>warmth, yet never lacking in the pyrotechnics for which Volodya was so famous. His treatment of the concerto is actually closer<BR>to his 1930 recording with Albert Coates and the London Symphony Orchestra.  A number of critics have pointed out that some portions of this recording were cut in the studio following the actual concert because Horowitz made a few mistakes.  That's all good and well, but this review is of the final, edited disc, not the concert itself.<br />How fortunate we are, as well, to have Rachmaninoff's close friend Eugene Ormandy as conductor for this eventful recording -<BR>this is the only available recording of Rachmaninoff's two greatest champions in collaboration. This, in fact, is my favourite classical recording - period. It documents Horowitz' first appearance with an orchestra since 1953 and one can sense the anticipation from the opening chords of hearing what Horowitz would come up with. This piece has been long known as Horowitz' warhorse, but for the first time, Horowitz does not pounce upon this great work immediately with his explosive pianism. <br />Instead of attacking the opening movement (Allegro ma non tanto) with the linear thrust of sound for which he was famous, here Horowitz delivers a subtle, reflective rendering. It is as though Horowitz has been holding back this concerto for twenty-five years, and doesn't want to let it go; each note is imbued with urgency and passion - flowing from Horowitz' fingers like so<BR>many precious gems and gold pieces. <br />His buildup to the cadenza is done superbly (Horowitz plays the original version, rather than the more virtuosic ossias. Commented Horowitz about his choice of cadenza, &quot;I play the original cadenza in the first movement. Rachmaninoff always played it too. You know, the cadenza really builds up to the end of the concerto. The alternate cadenza is like an ending in itself. It's not good to end the concerto before it's over!&quot;) <br />Eugene Ormandy's conducting is equally commanding and brilliant. I can only imagine what was going through his mind as he conducted this piece, which he had almost forty years before recorded with Rachmaninoff himself. While the strings are starker<BR>than those of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Ormandy skillfully bends the will of the New York Philharmonic to Horowitz' playing:<BR>Where Horowitz takes a relaxed tempo, the orchestra gives him plenty of room, playing in refrain off his melodies. Two<BR>examples of this are the simple, eloquent flute solo coming off the heels of Horowitz' cadenza in the first movement, and the<BR>undercurrent of the lower strings in the second (Intermezzo: Adagio) over which Horowitz conjures from his famed Steinway<BR>the entire range of his vast pianistic emotion. <br />Yet, when Horowitz explodes into flurries of chordal progression and crescendi, the Philharmonic brings in the air support he<BR>needs to pull off this concerto of massive and heroic proportions. In the finale (Alla Breve), all of the tentativeness and anxiety of the previous two movements are shed as Horowitz and Ormandy build to finale's climax. Deftly they work in unison, each passage building upon another suspensefully, tautly, the tempo accelerating ever so slightly to the impassioned conclusion. The last two minutes of the concerto are beautifully and triumphantly delivered, the brass and timpani playing in staccatoed counterpoint to Horowitz' piano, which ardently ascends in legato to the pinnacle of the concerto. <br />This performance, moreso than any other, brings out the fully romantic nature of this concerto.When the concerto is finished,<BR>you suddenly realise that the sense of rapture and deliverance you had felt has not left you. And when the last notes reverberate from your speakers, you won't know whether the thunderous ovation you hear is coming from the Carnegie Hall audience, or from within. <br />The second selection is the Second Piano Sonata, which was recorded in 1980.  As with the Third Concerto, this is a heavier and slower rendition than his 1968 Carnegie Hall recording, but I prefer the first movement on this one.  It's more reflective, and the second movement is played with simple honesty of feeling.  The finale is more of a massive cluster of notes than the 1968, but it is a good alternative.  Even when Horowitz was a little off, still no-one could touch him.  His own edited version of the 1913 and 1931 Rachmaninoff versions is the best I've heard, and wish Boosey and Hawkes would print a &quot;Horowitz Edition.&quot;  His grasp of Rachmaninoff was immediate and intuitive.
B000002UAO|5.0|There's not a whole lot to say about this record that hasn't already been said a thousand times. Just a few thoughts:<br />(1) John is starting to exhibit a downright scary level of compositional sophistication. His BIG FOUR (&quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; &quot;In My Life,&quot; &quot;Girl,&quot; and the breathtaking &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;) are all phenomenal. They make &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; - which is a perfectly good pop song - seem somewhat disappointing at the end of the record.<br />(2) Paul's output is a little less stunning (with the exception of the outstanding &quot;Drive My Car&quot;), but &quot;Michelle&quot; is a likeable ballad, &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; is a nice pop song, and &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot; is a great folk rocker.<br />(3) Hats off to George for great guitar playing throughout (his best to date) and for his growth as a composer. &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; was the best song he had written as of December 1965 and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; is great also.<br />(4) Oh yeah, and Ringo.....keep bangin' those skins.<br />An undeniable classic, one of the best 5 or 10 records ever made. If you don't already own it, you should.....really!
B00006G8LB|5.0|I do not have the attention span of a 3-year-old, so when I decided to see this film in the theater I was worried that it would not suit my 3-year-old son whom I am inseperable to and take everywhere with me, boy was I wrong! My son didn't even touch his candy or popcorn through the whole show!(all you mothers recognize this is rare). I took him to this film three (3) times, and every time he was wide-eyed, and amazed. The graphics and special effects in this film were definately very well done. The story line followed the original story and tastefully depicted a real superhero that I am glad my 3-year-old looks up to.  I recommend this as a gift for most boys especially where the release date is so near the holiday season. I definately will purchase this and count the days until this movie is available.
6305127638|4.0|This review is for the VHS version not the DVD version.<BR>First contact is the first star trek movie to feature just the next generation cast. The story begins with another invasion of our fun loving (resistence is futile) friends the Borg. Starfleet is cautious about Captain Picard being involved with the battle because he was simulated by the borg (Best of both worlds). Starfleet is loosing bad so Picard takes over the fleet and destroys the borg cube. The cube releases a probe that goes back in time to prevent the first human contact with aliens. The crew notices that the Earth has been completely simulated by the Borg. The Enterprise then goes back in time to stop the Borg and Find Zeffrem Cochrane (Played by James Cromwell of \\"Babe\\"). They go to ensure that he makes his historic warp flight. But in the meantime the borg have turned the enterprise into their own personal hive. There a side story of the frienship forming between Cochrane's assistant Lilly (Played by Alfre Woodard of \\"Miss Evers Boys\\")amd captain Picard. Picard becomes obssed with destroying the Borg that he would risk his own crew. A key scene is where lilly compares Captain Picard to Captain Ahab of \\"Moby Dick\\". Picard then relizes his efforts are futile. In the meantime the Borg Queen, played by Alice Krige, Tries to get Data to destroy Cochrane's ship. Well Data doesn't destroy the ship. The Vulcans see thee the ship and realizes that humams have obtained Warp Flight and to decide to make first contact. The scene were the volcan ship landing and the volcans making contact with the humans is similar to the contact scene in \\"Close Encounters of the third kind.\\" This movie shows why humans and vulcans have a close relationship. This movie eventually became the basis for the series \\"Enterprise\\" that takes places ninety years later. Gene Roddenberry's utopian vision of the future has become a pop cultural phenomenon. First Contact is a magnificent portrayal of the first steps toward that new world. When Picard leaves to return to the enterprise Lilly says she enies the world he is returning to. Picard says he is envious of her because she is able to witness the early steps that will become his world.
B000003TAW|5.0|I have had this CD since 1994 and I still listen to it all the time. This CD is so good, every song is great. I think the Buddy Holly music video is the greatest music video ever made.

B000050HTO|4.0|Let me start by saying that in most circumstances greatest hits albums are not needed. You don't see chapters from different Stephen King novels rolled into one........<br />I must say that if you want to be a Dylan fan you should buy the quintesenntial quartet of Blonde On Blonde, Blood On The Tracks (my favorite), Bringing it All Back Home, and Highway 61 Revisited. But for established Dylan fans like myself, &quot;Essential&quot; is a way to reflect on the immense talent that this man has had. The entire album tracks his career from his early folk days with &quot;Blowin' In The Wind&quot;, to the day he plugged in the guitar to his oscar winning &quot;Times Have Changed&quot;. &quot;Essential Dylan&quot; is not a must its a guilty pleasure that I think you should enjoy.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I saw Zoolander because someone recommended it to me when I mentioned that I really wanted to see a comedy that didn't have the disgusting elements of Austin Powers (which doesn't even back up disgusting with funny) or Scary Movie (just plain ...).  I didn't really think I would like Zoolander, but I took a chance and I loved it!<br />I won't even attempt to describe the movie, as there are a surprising number of little plot complexities and I don't want to ruin the movie for the potential watcher.  I'll just say that you have male models, vacuous empty brains, assisins, and tons of great eighties music.  The whole thing is funny and ridiculous and doesn't even try to pretend that it's anything else.<br />Some of the best stuff, though, is the extras on the DVD version. The VH1 fashion awards clips are hysterical as are the 'public service announcements' and a lot more.  The extras alone are worth watching.
B0000640VO|2.0|After having read the blistering attacks on this movie in the French daily &quot;Liberation&quot;,  I expected to either really like this movie or really hate it.  As it turns out, I just found it to be rather mediocre.<br />Bored, mostly working class, lives follow their course without hope of positive resolution.  The protagonist, Amelie, decides to add some magic to these lives by arranging a series of coincidences.  In other words, Amelie is sort of like God in a Kieslowski movie.  The only problem is that you get a buzz like the one you get from a McDonald's Happy Meal...empty calories, high on sugar.  Amelie has that glossy look just like the pretty people in those fragranced women's magazines.<br />So I can see why the French Left would have such a low opinion of this movie.  In a time of deindustrialization and rise of the Right, when most people hope to escape their &quot;fate&quot; by winning the lottery, arrives a film like Amelie which bolsters our hope that there are fairy-godmothers who will swoop down at the last moment and rescue us.<br />Well, you say, that is reading too much into it.  Perhaps. But even as pure fantasy, I found that it fell flat. There are some funny scenes, like the Gnome in New York!  It's a film that appeals to the French love of nuance and making mysteries unravel<BR>slowly and enticingly....des trucs interessants.  For these reasons, I have given it two stars.<br />-Thomas
B000002UAO|4.0|This album contains many of the Beatles earlier hits like &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;Nowhere man&quot;, &quot;You can drive my car&quot; and &quot;In my life&quot;. Every song is very well done. Norwegiian wood has a unique feel with its zitar (I hope I spelled it right) acompaniment.
B00003XACV|5.0|The music made the movie great. This guy has a lot of talent and I hope he does the music for more movies. He did a great job in the Shawshank Redemption and the Road to Perdition. All 3 great movies with great music.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Wonderful both in sound and sight.  It is killer from start to finish.  The symphony is made up of young adults to kids and they are having the best time playing some of the best polished rock ever made.  Yes is on tour now and I just saw them in Houston on August 15. Yes played for 2 1/2 hours and was a pure delight. Great to have Wakeman back, not to slight anyone else who has played keyboards for them.  Yes is a group which bridges the journey between rock and classical music. They gently move you from 3 minute music to full length pieces.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Proust bit into the madeleine which entrained a series of memories from his grandmother's house in Combray.  But we aren't in France at the turn of last century.  We're in Los Angeles at the turn of this century.  The heroine of our movie has opted for<BR>masturbation over sponge cake as a psychopomp.<br />Her autoerotic session zips her momentarily out of her grimy reality of unpaid rent and flagging dreams into a review of her hollywood career as she would like for it to have been. Lynch brilliantly explores our reveries in this film!<br />Thomas
B00006F7XJ|5.0|This is a Masterpiece Work.<BR>Andy has showed that is better with age. Like the Good Wine!! <BR>Long life to Camel
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is very good. You have to be stupid not to buy it. The whole way the Cd is put together is great. My favorite song on this CD is Superman. That song is great. One of my favorite songs ever. Cleaning out my Closet, Without Me, White America, and Sing for the Moment are great too. You can not get sick of listening to this CD. Eminem and Jay-Z are the only good rappers out there.
B000067CPX|2.0|Boy, was I disappointed with this CD. I've been a big fan of RHCP since Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but this album just bored me. I haven't even been able to force myself to listen to it--I'll probably wind up selling it, and I *rarely* sell a disc, much less a RHCP disc. My advice: don't bother with this one. I even like One Hot Minute more than this disc, by a long shot.
0783226063|3.0|There have been 2 movies made from the novel Dune.  I think Dune is a cornerstone science fiction work, along with I, Robot, The Stars My Destination, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Ringworld.  This movie follows the &quot;flavor&quot; of the novel well in costumes, sets, and special effects, but fails to capture the spirit and theme of the story well.  I think they missed the idea of a predestined leader, and the conflict between duty and personal desire.  They substituted a love story and a new ending (it didn't rain in the book).  The other Dune movie follows the story line a lot closer, but fails miserably in the appearance of Arrakis and the Freemen.  A blend of the two strong point might have produced a masterpiece instead of two lukewarm flicks.
B00004XMV6|1.0|Why did she go visit Mr. Farnsworth? Why did we need to see that? Typical of most of the scenes in this movie, her visit to the country is out of place, poorly connected to the rest of the story, and not easily interpreted.<br />The seduction and eventual submission of the heroine was interesting. But the execution was miserable and the plot thready, at best. I think the problem is that the movie tried to do _too_ much -- to tell that story _and_ try to incorporate another message.<br />Sorry -- but if there's real art here, it completely eluded me. <br />The photography is sometimes very interesting and creative, but just as often too dark or awkward. The audio production of the DVD edition is trrible; the dialogue is not cleanly recorded or balance, causing the sound effects to be overwhelming and annoying.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I thought it was weird. After I thought about it for awhile I wanted to see it again so I bought it. It is really good. The music is really good and the story is great. I can see why this won. It deserved it. Kevin Spacey is a good actor.
B0000636UN|3.0|Being a fan of Sheryl's music over the past several<br />collections, I was looking forward to some new music<br />from her. As 2001 came to a close and I started reading<br />more press, I read where she had been depressed because<br />she didn't know just where her music could fit in to<br />todays \\"pop\\" market. I then saw her in the magazine stands<br />showing alittle T & A and I was more than disheartened by<br />this \\"new\\" attidute of hers. Sure, she's a beautiful woman<br />in her early 40's but you can see that anywhere, anytime. I enjoy Sheryl for her contribution to music. I've listened to the new collection many times<br />and very few original ideas came out of this music. She's taking liberties with other musical licks, especially from the 70's great artists and trying for this new<br />breezie sound but to me shes fighting to stay young, she,<br />whos beautiful and talented just comes off cheap.  I have<br />always respected Sheryl Crow for her originality in lyrics<br />and music and saw her as fresh and able to ignite women's music<br />as rock radio has gone back to just showing off the big boys<br />music(sad state out there!)or the other option top 40. I agree there are several catchy numbers here but after you hear them enough, its enough. I guess<br />she needed another big hit like \\"All i want to do\\". I really<br />liked the song she had done after 9/11 on tv but she butchered<br />it on this new collection, I'm sure she'll come down off of her perch and give us some adult music we can sink our teeth into and<br />leave the bubblegum/T&A to the younger pop generation.
B000069HKH|5.0|I was elated to hear about Bruce coming out with this album with 9/11 themes.  I would've always thought that if anyone could do this right, he would be the one.  And he doesn't disappoint.<br />This album is not perfect, but it is real close.  Some people knock it for being too cliched or simplistic but I feel that he captures the proper mood with this album.  I wouldn't think that &quot;Thunder Road&quot; type songs would work as well on an album like this, though I would love for him to return to that in the future.  Practically every song captures the audience and allows them to share the grief, loss and fear that humans feel through tragic times, yet also providing hope for the future and the power of true love.  If that is simplistic, then that is what Bruce probably felt was needed.  And I would agree.<br />Musically, I feel that the E Street Band is in fine form on this album.  I wish that Clarence Clemens had a greater presence on the album as I enjoy his sax playing, but other than that the band's clicking on all cylinders.  Musically this is an example of American roots rock at it's best as well as a rundown on the band's own history.  Basically they incorporate sounds from just about every era of their entire history.  And it works.<br />Best song: &quot;World's Apart&quot;.  The harmonies are magnificent and they work well with the E Street styled rock better than I could have imagined.  The title track is classic Bruce, along with &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;.  &quot;Waiting on a Sunny Day&quot; is a &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; styled song musically and &quot;Mary's Place&quot; goes back even farther bringing back images of his 70's songs.  &quot;Nothing Man&quot; would fit in great on &quot;Born in the USA&quot; and should be a classic.  &quot;Paradise&quot; displays his 90's sound to perfection.  Basically, there are no week songs on this album.  That is rare these days.<br />5 stars is too high for this album, 4 stars is too low, so I went with the higherrating.  This may not be his best album, but certainly it is his best since &quot;Born in the USA&quot; and this certainly reinforces that Bruce Springsteen is a legend in the history of American Rock and Roll.  I recommend this album to everybody.

B000003FD9|1.0|The Starker recording of the Bach cello suites is perhaps the best music ever made. They appear on RCA and Mercury. BUY the Mercury, not the RCA recording. There is a big difference!
B000002UB3|5.0|Opinions about which one is The Beatles' best album have always been divided. There are people who consider Revolver to be their best, most consistent and most unified work as a band, there are others who think Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is their most ambitious, fascinating, exhilarating and experimental (concept) album. The White Album is a cult fave and its fair number of fans think it's the band's most diverse and eclectic work and shows each band member's talent as a group and individually. Others think Rubber Soul is the most important album since it's the turning point from cutesy teeny bopper mob top band to true artists and it's where the songwriting started to get complex, dark and introspective. And last but not least, there's the group that thinks Abbey Road is the band's best produced and polished album, even to the point of thinking that this album is the reason of The Beatles' legendary status.<br />I happen to fit in that last group, for I think Abbey Road is the Beatles' greatest masterpiece. By this time the band was already starting to fall apart, but by listening to this album, it would lead you to believe the exact opposite. Abbey Road sees Paul and George at their creative peak, George finally came out from the shadows of Lennon and McCartney to finally grow into a wonderful musician and songwriter with two masterpieces that in this reviewer's opinion are two of the Top 10 Beatles' songs, those are the beautiful love song \\"Something\\" and breathtakingly moving \\"Here Comes The Sun\\". McCartney flexed his vocal muscles here than in any other album (the possible exception being \\"Helter Skelter\\" in The White Album) with the rocking \\"Oh! Darling\\", The gorgeous piano-driven \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and \\"Golden Slumbers\\". Ringo also has a tune here, and what a deliciously playful and sweet one it is, \\"Octopus's Garden\\", a sequel to \\"Yellow Submarine\\", which is totally superior to its predecessor. Even though John is not as prominent in this album as in previous albums, he still comes off with great material, the classic \\"Come Together\\", the beautifully evocative and haunting \\"Because\\" and \\"I Want You\\", a perfectly successful attempt at hard rock. But despite all the great material mentioned before, what makes this album the masterpiece that it is, it's in the two medley of songs that are located in Side B of the album. Lennon and McCartney put together a group of cut songs that work so well together as a whole that it's probably The Beatles highest point in a wonderful musical career, the songs blend together from one to another so effortlessly that is simply a tour de force in music production. From \\"Sun King\\" to \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" and from the emotional \\"Golden Slumbers\\" to the heartbreaking \\"The End\\", it's one of the most exhilarating, touching, beautiful and greatest, if not the greatest moment in music history.<br />\\"Abbey Road\\" is an album that showed why The Beatles were so great and showed their creativity and artistry at its highest, and it's amazing that the album ended up being such a masterwork when the band was about to break up. \\"Abbey Road\\" is probably the best album in Rock n' Roll history, it's the greatest masterpiece from the greatest band in the history of music. Unmissable! A must-have for any music lover.
B0000025P9|3.0|This CD appears to me as commercial overrated album from a band that I like very much. The song &quot;Africa&quot; can surely make any bad album listenable, because it's a great track. If you want to buy this CD because of the song, you shouldn't ! Try a best-of album like &quot;Toto's greatest hits&quot; which represents their 20 years carrier.<br />Let me explain why I don't like this album. The songs are terribly monotonous and have no power, no energy. In one sentence, it doesn't rock ! The CD also suffers from a bad production. Just listen to the following &quot;Isolation&quot; !<br />Don't make yourself a bad image of Toto with this album. Africa is no reason for buying this. My recommandations would be either &quot;Toto&quot; the 1st album, or if you want powerful songs, &quot;The seventh one&quot;, &quot;Kingdom of desire&quot; or &quot;Tambu&quot;.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This was one movie that I was looking forward to. I'm a big fan of the book and was looking forward to the big screen adaption of this classic story. I was extremely let down by this incredibly lame retelling. Guy Pearce, after his fabulous job in the spectacular 'Memento', loses any momentum he may have received after that film and turns in a incredibly wooden performance as our 'hero'.  Samantha Mumba though, makes him look like an oscar winner thanks to her totally unbeliveable performace as... I forget. She might as well have read her lines right off a script or something. But even worse, yes, as I soon found out it can get much worse, are the amazingly fake and in no way frightening Morlocks. Jeremy Irons, did I previously mention something about an oscar winner? I take it back, is so bad, and I mean BAD as in yuck in this role and I will never know why he accepted to play such a bland, emotionless character. Orlando Jones appears briefly as a technical something or other. It doesn't matter though. He makes no noticeable contribution to this confused, insanity filled madness (Cool, I used three words in consecutive order that mean the exact same thing, I could've written this script!). <BR>So, why you say do I give this film two stars and not just one? <BR>It had some pretty cool f/x. That is the only redeeming quality of this 'film'. If you're interested in the time machine I have some really good advice. If you haven't, read the book!
B00003CXCK|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS THE BEST EVER. THE DIRECTION IS THE BEST EVER. SPIELBERG IS A MASTER. THE FILM EDITING IS SUPERB. THE ACTING IS GREAT. SCHINDLER'S LIST TELLS THE STORY OF OSKAR SCHINDLER. HE BECOMES A PROFITALBLE BUSINESS MAN IN KRAKOW, POLAND. WE ARE ALSO INTRODUCED TO AMON GOETH WHO IS PORTRAYED BY RALPH FIENNES. FIENNES GIVES THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF THE FILM. FIENNES LOST AT THE OSCARS TO TOMMY LEE JONES. IF YOU WATCH FIENNES AND THEN YOU WATCH JONES, YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IN THE WORLD FIENNES DIDN'T GET AN OSCAR. LIAM NEESON IS SUPERB AS OSKAR SCHINDLER. KINGSLEY GIVES A FINE SUPPORTING PERFROMANCE. THE BEST PICTURE OF THE DECADE AND ALSO THE BEST PICTURE EVER MADE. I DON'T SEE HOW CITIZEN KANE IS NUMBER 1 ON AFI 100 GREATEST. IF THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO SCHINDLER'S LIST, THEY SHOULD AT LEAST GAVE IT TO THE GODFATHER. ALL IN ALL, THE FINEST FILM EVER MADE. THE CAMERA MOVES BEAUTIFULLY JUST THE WAY SPEILBERG LIKES.
0316776963|5.0|I bought this book in a frantic moment. As a big reader, I was faced with an entire night of basketball on TV with nothing to read. I had to leave the room because my husband couldn't hear the game over my laughter. I moved all the way to the bedroom and shut the door. He could still hear me laughing! I have honestly NEVER laughed out loud at a book. I couldn't even re-read favorite essays out loud because I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. Mr. Sedaris is adept at showing us his family and life, with all of it's oddities and making us laugh and think at the same time. I have since read all of his other books and purchased some on audio tape, but nothing will ever make me laugh as hard as the Christians trying to explain Easter in French to the Muslim girl.
B000059WH0|5.0|Steve Lukather, the guitarist of the group Toto, hasn't had any real occasion to show his talent during these 15 years in the band. But we must admit that Toto wasn't an hard rock band, so there wasn't any room for guitar riffs. So this is the occasion for him to express himself, on both guitar and vocals.<br />4 singers have been in Toto from 1977 to 1992, but I'll give you a honest opinion : none of them were -to me- as talented as Steve Lukather. He has a great emotional and strong voice.<BR>And this album is huge change in Toto's carrier. You can forget the past pop albums; this one is hard rock.<br />The main highlights are two great ballads &quot;Don't chain my heart&quot;, &quot;2 hearts&quot;, two great rock songs &quot;gypsy train&quot;, &quot;never enough&quot; and the tribute to Jeff Porcaro &quot;wings of time&quot;, the drummer who recently died.
B000068TPN|4.0|I expected this to be a great movie and I must say I was slightly let down. I was expecting a Vietnam version of Braveheart in a way which I suppose was a tough standard to beat. The bad thing though was that I had seen this after two other war movies, 'Behind Enemy Lines' and 'Black Hawk Down'. 'Black Hawk Down' was in my opinion a better film and 'Behind Enemy Lines' was very different in that it went more for a summer popcorn type of war movie. Mel Gibson is, as always, terrific here and Sam Elliot does a great job as well. This is a different film than 'Black Hawk Down' was in that it showed the enemy's viewpoint as well as the view on the homefront. I thought that this worked to the film's advantage. <BR>I must however say that this is a better war movie than the recent John Woo film 'Windtalkers' which was, after four war films, nothing new. Explosions get a little less exciting and the story falters after the chain of recent war films but nevertheless this is a film that I would recommend if the subject matter is of interest.
0316666343|5.0|I could not put it down.  It was so beautifully written it had a etherial cast to it.  How one can put so much love and sorrow in the same book I don't know.  This is one of those books that when you are finished, you want to sit in a dark room and quietly meditate about what you just read.  Not since I was fifteen and  read The Arch of Trimuph has a  book so impressed me.
B00005V9HH|2.0|granted, this movie has a very clever ending. yet the other 90% of it simply left me scratching my head. not that i can never think while watching a movie, but a movie this convoluted needs a map or something.
B000002LOE|5.0|This is the REM album that really made them popular, this is a more commercial album than the previous ones. But it's clear for me that it's also one of their best, if not THE best REM. The band is still young and has still very much to offer.<br />The song &quot;Losing my religion&quot; is the most famous and it's sure the album wouldn't have been so good without it. But &quot;Out of time&quot; is not ONLY &quot;Losing my religion&quot;. And though not heard on the radio, the songs &quot;Texarkana&quot;, &quot;half a world away&quot;, &quot;country feedback&quot; are a real pleasure to listen.<br />Sure, there are some negative points : the songs &quot;belong&quot; and &quot;endgame&quot; are simply too boring. But it's nothing compared to the great voice of Michael Stipe, which is in my opinion at its best point. The guitars are very listenable, which is not the case of later albums following &quot;automatic for the people&quot;.
6304681011|5.0|My brother first had me view this as a little girl (many years ago) and it is as frightening now as it was then.  The main factor I see in it as an adult is the woman's obstacle in \\"crossing over\\" because she denies having any form of sprirituality.  But the bottom line is that this is one scary film without having to resort to gore, sex or even color.  And I still thank my brother for having me watch it.
B000002MG1|5.0|There is no doubt for me that this is a good album. But I wouldn't say this is their best. I'd rather say it's the one which has the most easy listenable songs. Aside from the highlight &quot;Everybody hurts&quot;, there are some good tracks.<br />&quot;Drive&quot; is an emotional song that finishes with good guitar tunes. &quot;try not to breathe&quot;, &quot;man on the moon&quot; are also very good songs. However, I don't like the tracks &quot;sweetness follows&quot;, &quot;star me kitten&quot; because it doesn't shows enough energy, unlike &quot;Ignoreland&quot;, a good striking, powerful song.<br />The whole album shows a good work, though for me not as good as &quot;Out of time&quot;. Nothing is very bad in it. Some people say it's the best but it's not my opinion. It's better than their later realeases.
079284209X|3.0|When the cold war ended, not only the Soviet Union went out of business.  Cadres of intelligence agents on both sides must have found themselves with time aplenty on their hands.  In RONIN, director John Frankenheimer weaves a multi-standed tale of a group of for-hire ex-professionals who want to earn a living using their unique skills.  Robert DeNiro plays Sam, an ex-CIA man who links up with a group of similarly unemployed spies who are hired by the IRA to retrieve a mysterious suitcase from the Russian/French mob alliance.  Sam strikes up an unlikely relation with Vincent (Jean Reno) and part of the film turns into a buddy road movie with each taking turns saving the life of the other.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I have to say that I used to watch the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; T.V. show when I was a kid, but it never really attracted me as a fan.  In fact, I just watched it for fun.  Until &quot;Star Trek-The Motion Picture&quot; caught my attention.  I fell in love with this movie because it was like looking at a painting about outer space, supported by spectacular visual effects by Douglas Trumbull (&quot;Close Encounters Of The Third Kind&quot;) and John Dykstra (&quot;Star Wars&quot;), a magnificent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, and a fine screenplay -although many people think it's too cerebral.  Robert Wise directed this film a bit slow, that some people may think it's boring.  But I don't care because I'd give it five stars all the same because my admiration for &quot;Star Trek&quot; woke up thanks to this movie.<br />However, I'm giving this Director's Edition DVD only four stars.  Why?  Because some scenes were eliminated -or even chopped up - and that makes this version a bit strange, a bit incomplete. In the plus side, though, some visual F/X shots were added, giving the film's look some freshness and a great repair to some incongruent shots in the original cut, apparently because of time constraints.  If only the Klingon battle scene had been polished, because the matte lines surrounding the Klingon cruisers are still visible.  How sad because that's one of the best scenes in the movie.<br />As for the extra features, I have to say that they are very good, specially the documentaries regarding the different stages of the film's production, the rush the makers had to face in order to meet their December 1979 opening.  Thank goodness that the deleted scenes from the original version are there on the second disc, as well as the unaltered scenes.<br />This DVD is an interesting edition that should have deserved five stars if those aforementioned deleted scenes had been included and the F/X on the Klingon battle sequence had been polished.
0780021967|5.0|Five stars in all might make me sound like an easy-to-please viewer, but I don't see how this DVD could be better. Criterion never disappoints, so if you're buying this film it's worth paying extra for this one. I believe the transfer is way superior and the extras go on longer than an awards night. <BR>The documentary focuses on Hitchcock's British films, which aren't as widely seen these days and also a complete radio broadcast from 1937. Talk about diggin' up some material! I also enjoyed the commentary and that press book stuff. I'm not even sure I've seen it all. Actually, I'm still not sure what The 39 Steps really is exactly, but who cares? I pity people who don't watch certain movies because they're old and black &amp; white. The reason people should see this film is because no one can make a film like this anymore. This is a great film, don't miss it.
6304698542|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  It is an American classic.  All cast deserves five stars, but Liza Minnelli deserves ten.  She had never been better.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I've noticed the bulk of these reviews are very positive. Now I'm not reviewing the dvd because I haven't got it. I want to talk about the film itself. First let me say I love superhero movies and I did enjoy Spiderman to some degree. BUT!!! There are a few reasons why this film could have been better. Point one - Movies these days don't seem to unravel at a good pace. The narrative seemed rushed, like the film makers were making this for a generation of people who need action all the time or else they'll lose interest. Parker got bitten by the spider and was climbing buildings 5 minutes later. Point two - There is some pretty corny dialogue in this. How did Toby Macguire say some of these lines without bursting into laughter. I refer to the banter between him and Dunst, involving how beautiful he thinks she is and BLAAAHHHH!!! Point three - The Green Goblin guy looked really fake. CGI can either be good or really bad. In this case it stank. The hollywood film industry is becoming like fast food. Quick, processed and leaves you feeling a bit empty. But I'm gonna leave this review on a good note. Macguire was well casted, DaFoe was hilarious, Dunst is georgeous and there's always a chance the sequel might be an improvement. Thank you, I'm done.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Rating: 10.0<BR>The album Amnesiac by Radiohead is just another great album. It has more variety than their other albums and that doesn't hurt it. It is no as visual a their best Kid A (which is in my opinion the best album I've ever heard.) This is just another amazing album by the best band on earth. Some of the songs are extremely visual and again in some of the songs they let the music tell the story instead of the words which is far better. The songs are all great and in don't think just good. They all have the brilliance that only Radiohead possesses.<BR>On \\"Pact\\" the percussion is inventive and the music is also brilliant. Even though most didn't like \\"Pulk\\" it is very good. \\"Morning Bell\\" is also great in this version. \\"Spinning Plates\\" is  amazing the lyrics are perfect and the music gets the drugged torture down perfectly. \\"Glasshouse\\" is different from everything and the lyrics are so powerful and the whole feeling is what only Radiohead can achieve.<BR>I have been comparing Radiohead to U2 and it is so obvious that Radiohead is far better. U2 has talent there is no doubt about it but the don't even compare to them in anyway. Radiohead is so superior to all the bands out there the only band that is even close is Sigur Ros but they are sill a long way behind.<BR>Radiohead had released  it's fourth album that will go down in history as one of the best of all time. They might not get all the credit they deserve for Amnesiac or Kid A now but in 20 to 30 years they will get their fame.
B00005JLF5|5.0|By season two, Deep Space Nine had become the best of the Star Trek spin-offs.  The excellent writing and complex characters made it one of the best tv shows ever produced.  The bad guys were smart and incredibly devious, the science was amazing, and the story lines were epic.  I can't wait for it to be released on DVD.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is an amazing rock album that will appeal to many people. The music is a step below OK Computer but definately up there as one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Radiohead kicked off their flawless streak with this album. Their 4th best but that is in no way and insult. Order of their albums in quality. 1 Kid A 2 Ok Computer 3 Amnesiac 4 The Bends 5 Pablo Honey. The music and lyrics are great.
B00004WG2X|3.0|The 1980 BBC version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is pleasurable viewing. Persons who have read the book with pleasure will find the familiar characters presented skillfully, and with no little attention to the spirit of the book.<br />However, in my opinion, the later version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; with Colin Firth as d'Arcy is superior in practically every respect - from direction and acting, to costumes and even hairstyling. If I wanted to introduce a friend to a dramatization of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, I would keep this edition on the shelf and given him or her the Colin Firth version.<br />I must add, too, that the video reproduction is surprisingly poor for a BBC/Warner release. The colors are washed out, especially in the interior scenes; for examples, the officers' coats are pinkish instead of scarlet. From time to time, figures in the foreground are slightly fuzzy or have a halo around them. The poor quality of the tape detracted from what is otherwise an enjoyable performance.
B00005JLEX|5.0|...And so are millions of other loyal Seinfeld viewers. I think the release of the Seinfeld series on DVD is way overdue. So come on already, were dying out here. Serenity Now!
B000003TAW|4.0|This is an album in the mold of many of the greats, with the structure and great songs all throughout. My favorite though is the incredible bass driven &quot;Only In Dreams&quot; which closes the album, clocking in at 8 minutes and not a second too long.
B00006690G|4.0|I liked the \\"marshall mathers\\" cd right away, so I got this one expecting the same reaction.  It took me a few listenings, but I have to say that I like this one too.  Em just seems like he's having a lot of fun.  The \\"show\\" theme runs through the CD.  I also liked \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\"--it cracks me up.  Hailie is a nut!  <br />Em speaks to many people through his music.  He acknowledges this and reacts to it.  His messages throughout the CD are intelligent and the raps are very well written.  He definitely has a gift for the sounds of words and how they can fit together.  While I may not like 100% of what he's saying, I can at least acknowledge the fact that he is indeed talented.<br />Let's hope he keeps going.
0345448898|5.0|Philip Pullman pulls off a triumph of style and substance to bring us one of the most thought-provoking trilogies of the last decade. The characters are well-developed, grabbing the attention and emotions of the reader in a thrilling way.<br />Those previous posters who think that Pullman is disrespectful in his vision of 'God' as a weak and ultimately killable character would do well to look up Gnosticism and pay particular attention to the concept of the Demiurge.
B00003CXXP|4.0|A good movie and a good DVD treatment. I won't get into why I think this movie's underrated, except to say . . . well, I liked it. Except for the last 30 minutes. And the beauty of it is, now I can just press the stop button when I want to.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Whe I first heard about the show I was slightly skepitical that they could make a good story line out of this. I was right.  They didn't create a good story line.  they made a great storyline.  My Tuesday nights have definatly become more fun.  The show has been amazing.  The acting and writing has been super.  Michael, Tom, and Kristen are perfect.  Chole and Pete really make the show.  John Glover was made to play Lionel Luthor.  And the special affects are awesome.  Nothing is every small in Smallville.  They even make the feak of the week thing cool.  I would definatly recommend this dvd to anyone who even slightly likes Superman.
B000050IE6|5.0|This is the second Opeth album I have bought so far, the first being Blackwater Park. Between the two, I'd have to say that Blackwater Park is better. However, that doesn't mean this isn't good! &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; is a great slow song, better than &quot;Harvest&quot; even. I really love the bass riffs on it, and the way that it suddenly goes from an R&amp;B-style groove to doom metal. And &quot;Moonlapse Vertigo&quot; is simply excellent, a precursor to &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; and &quot;Bleak&quot; on Blackwater Park. The songs seem to tell a story about some sort of outcast who returns home to his old girlfriend despite much hardship only to find her married to another man. Not the best lyrics, but still, you've got to admire Mikael's vocals. If you're new to Opeth, check out Blackwater Park. Once you're acquainted with their unique sound, then get this! I promise you won't regret it!
B000066AXC|3.0|In the year 2001, most film critics fell into one of two categories: those who thought \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" was a masterpiece, and those who thought it was Hollywood trash. I fall in between the two (though leaning slightly towards the latter view) in that I think it is a piece of fairly average filmmaking that could have been quite great. The film seems to be trying to emphasize so many elements of its story that it completely loses focus and, instead of really focusing on them, gives us a little bit of everything in hopes to please everyone. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" could have been a great drama, a great romance, and, most of all in my opinion, a really great psychological thriller. But what it is instead is a collection of mediocre scenes from each of these genres. The acting is quite well done, as is most of the direction (though Ron Howard isn't quite suited for this material, which would have done better with some more flamboyant and exciting camerawork and editing.) It is mainly in the screenplay that I find fault. It lacks a sens of direction, as I said before. It tries hard to be a character study, but it lacks the ability to make John Nash seem like a real, live person. It tries to be a romance, but there are very few well-written scenes (and surprisingly few scenes at all) between Crow and Connoly, and the two actors manage to ruin those that are. And as for \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" the psychological thriller, it has only one real surprise, which merely distracts from the rest of what the film is trying to be. What would have been a lot more interesting from my point of view would be to have several little surprises leading up to the big one. More things we thought were real that aren't and some things we think are not real that are. This may not have been the deepm thought-provoking drama the film wants to be, but it would still have been a much more interesting, exciting, and profound film. Anyway, that's my two cents worth, Ron. \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was the Best Picture I saw this year.
B00005A0N5|4.0|Of all of Nightwish's albums that I have heard (Angels Fall First and Wishmaster included), Oceanborn was my favorite. Assuming everything not mentioned about the music is perfect, here's what you, as an American listener who is even reading this review, might find wrong with the music.<br />The largest aspect of the music that tends to alienate American audiences (explaining the fact that Nightwish is virtually unheard of in the US, yet on the top 20 in Germany and other parts of Europe) is the somewhat odd metaphors used in the lyrics. Let's face it, Americans are some of the coolest (and thereby least tolerent of oddities in music) people in the world. Nightwish makes constant references to &quot;less-than-cool&quot; topics not commonly found in popular American music, such as north European mythology, 80's style dream thearterey (a-la Dio), and a lot of kooky stuff I couldn't comprehend. They make constant references to bodies of water, using them as symbols of complex, deep emotions (I think), stuff that isn't typically found in some of our more superficial pop music (oops, I compared stuff again!). And the fact that English is the second language of all of the band members doesn't help.<br />The melodies are rather original and very, umm, melodic. This music is typically for people who are fans harder, more complex rock'n'roll, and straight-up opera.<br />The particular highlights from this album are Stargazers (powerful), Gethsemane (brooding), Moondance (Russian), The Riddler (hurt my ears), Walking in the Air (relaxing), and Sleeping Sun (Waling in the Air, part 2).
B00005JKJA|1.0|I was amazed by how people tried to justify  a junk as being &quot;artistic&quot; because of Lynch's reputation. This movie is definitely no &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;! However, I agree that Naomi Watts delivered an Oscar-winning performance.
0316666343|5.0|This is a beautiful and moving tale of a 15 year old whose life is taken from her.  While the novel could have been mired away in sentiment and gloom it is an uplifting and thoroughly engaging story.  Susie (the main character)makes a beautiful connection with her friends, family and even those who barely knew her.  The ending goes a little too &quot;Ghost&quot; but other than that it is a truly inspiring read.
B000002KB8|5.0|This was the debut of one of the most famous and worshipped hard rock bands of all time....Black Sabbath. This bands sound was so dark and ..., we just had to listen to it. This was the band that made parents hate heavy metal (Vanilla Fudge never got church groups marching to stop their shows!). This band was heavy metal in the flesh. The album was great. I always thought Deep Purple was better, but Sabbath made more of an impact. There have been countless heavy metal bands since metal's invention in the 60's, but none seemed so metal as Sabbath.
B00005YXZH|3.0|Is this the best album Wilco/Uncle Tupelo/Jeff Tweedy has produced, the masterpiece of our age, the album that puts Sgt. Pepper in its place with the Starland Vocal Band and Mac Davis?  Uh... no.  It's a typical modern bit of droning sensitive-singer-songwriter stuff, too nasal to be really pleasant, too much the same to be fully memorable.  Not terrible (the Kinks-like &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is quite good), but not noticeably better than, say, almost any High Llamas album.  Why the hype, other than to flip off the record company that wouldn't release it?  I really don't know.
B00000AF95|5.0|I didn't jump on the 80's KISS bandwagon right away. I didn't think KISS's non makeup albums were going to be good. I bought &quot;Lick it Up&quot; and was instantley introduced to one of my favorite KISS albums. &quot;Animalize&quot; in a great record, but it's no &quot;Destroyer&quot;. KISS made great 80's discs until &quot;Crazy Nights&quot;.<BR>That album was only above &quot;Unmasked&quot; as the worst KISS album.<BR>&quot;Animalize&quot; is a great hair metal record for the 80's metalhead, or it's great for KISS fans.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great movie.  Disney after Beauty and the Beast, movie wise was going down hill(for the exception of the Toy Stories)but this movie is bringing back the Disney magic.  The story line follows two monsters, part of Monsters inc.  Monsters inc. is a company in the monster world that collects childrens screams.  Monsters really are afraid of children.  But a little girl who the monsters find in the human world comes in to the monster world.  It has the Disney Storyline that we have been missing for so long.  The CGI makes it look really cool.  A definite Must buy.  A mesterpiece.
B00004YKUY|2.0|What is there to say? If Neal and the boys decided to change the name of the band, like Steve Perry suggested, perhaps I would have liked this cd more. However great a singer Augeri is, he is a poor substitute to Steve Perry, he simply cannot capture the magic that Perry's voice brought to Journey. I compared Steve Augeri's singing to Steve Perry's the whole cd, and why not? Steve Perry, like it or not, was the heart of the band, he's the one that the general people know, not Neal Schon, Johnathan Cain, and whoever else is in the band. If you buy this cd expecting to hear the Journey you've grown up with, you will be in for a rude awakening, it's not them anymore. I aggree with what Journey's old manager, Herbie said, &quot;If anyone tried to make Journey disappear, nobody would be there to stop them.&quot;
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Thsi is a very nice film.  I don't own this DVD so I don't know the special features so I just am rating the film.  You know the story.  The animation is amazing for it's time, and bet it's visually remastered in this addition.  Get it.
B00003CXXS|1.0|I can't believe how bad this movie was.  I didn't expect much (I never do out of sequels like these), but this movie fell beneath any expectation.  The movie has no plot, unless of course you consider a bunch of people running from dinosaurs for 90 minutes entertaining.<BR>There are some movies that should just be left alone after the first.  I thought we learned that with JAWS.  Yes, it was fun to watch a shark terrorizing the coast for one movie, but it got really old, really fast after that.  Here is another example of an idea overdone.  Stay away from this one.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Why is this a bad movie. I found it quite entertaining. Sure Jar Jar {toosh] was annoying but I didn't think it was that bad as you people portrray it to be. The movie is just as good as the special effects. The DVD is beautiful. It probably has the best special features in any DVD. It has a documentary of the making of the movie which is an hour long. It has the original storyboards and much much more. It has over six hurs of play time. This DVD is definetly Highly reccomended for Star Wars fans!  Get this DVD, and don't bother about the VHS movie cuz this has great special featurs!
B00003CXPJ|1.0|Seeing all the positive reviews for this movie finally explains to me how SNL manages to stay on the air. I can't imagine a movie with less redeeming qualities than this. Whether it is the paper thin plot, the ridiculously bad script/dialogue, its utter predictability, its complete inability to be funny, or clever, or the poor acting. It's really nothing more than an orgy of B-list cameos, punctuated by the worst jokes assembled since Jerry Lewis stopped making movies (thank the gods!).<br />   Ben Stillers ability to make a decent movie seems to be completely arbitrary, and this movie is a perfect example of too much creative leeway. Oh, if only the producers could have reigned him in. I guess, in the end, there was so little story here that they had to put as much filler in as they could manage. I can't remember a single point in this movie that my lips parted, and even the hint of a laugh escaped. What I do remember is a lot of looking at my watch, and wondering how such garbage of irredeemably low quality can be invested in. ...<br />   This movie just fails in every regard to be funny to me. I like comedies, and I love to laugh; but I can't stand rubbish like this. If you, like me, don't think SNL has been funny in the last eight years, then I strongly recommend that you avoid this movie at all costs. Even if you're in the mood for a bad movie, it still does not qualify! If however, you do think SNL is clever, witty, or poignant satire of contemporary society, then you will love this movie; it's right at your level, and I do hope you enjoy it because you deserve each other.
B000069HKH|1.0|Sorry Springsteen Fans.  The miracle just did not happen for me on this one.  The CD is too dark, too moody, too post 9-11.  Even though that's an important date in our history, one we should never forget,the CD just brought me down and left me down.  Every song sounded the same.  The same beat the same lyrics.  Too much fluff!  The backgound vocals and music overshadowed Bruce's otherwise great voice.  Burce should have stayed longer in the studio on this one.  I don't know if BS is going to give the proceeds of this one to  9-11 causes or not, if he is then this CD might be worth buying, if not then don't bother he's only trying to make money on the situation. I had though about going to his concert, but based on this CD have decided to save my money and see Mellencamp instead.
B000065U1N|5.0|Yet more evidence of an ungrateful nation; and I'm not speaking about Somalia. As an active duty service member, it doesn't take long before someone you know, someone you trained with, gets killed. In some ways it doesn't matter if it was in the line of duty, or some random off duty accident, it hurts just the same. And there's always some jerk who feels compelled to point out that that person knew what they were signing up for. I'm sorry, I didn't sign up with the intention of dying; but if that's what it takes to save a buddy, or people you may never meet, what would you do?<br />   It's a sorry state of affairs when it takes a movie to get Americans to realize that there are people out there dying all the time to make sure that those same Americans can sit comfortably in a theatre, eating popcorn, and carrying on as if there aren't really parts of the world where acts of unimaginable horror are common place. So oblivious have we become, that Hollywood is now our source of history lessons, and even our conscience. I read some of these negative reviews, and they make me laugh. What a fitting legacy to those who sacrificed their own lives, that there are people who will complain about the minutiae of a movie. Grow up. More importantly, I would like you to think long and hard about the fact that even though the movie ended, and you went on with your easy lives, those people who died, they're still dead. They still left widows, and they still left children behind that will never know them. Do you think they wanted to die? Do you think they wanted to die for a country of people who forgot about them as easily as last weeks lotto numbers? Americans scoff at the idea that freedom isn't free; well at least those who have never had to sacrifice a single thing for either, which is most Americans these days.<br />   So here it is, the movie a lot of us have been waiting for, a movie no less important, or significant than Saving Private Ryan. At least in that movie there wasthe bitter sweet satisfaction of one small victory in all the sea of misery. Not so in Black Hawk Down. There is no sugary ending for the vapid self absorbed movie-goer. I am grateful that just about all of you will never have to live through something like this, and can only hope that I won't ever have to either. I am grateful that there are those out there who put their lives on the line for people the rest of the world would just as soon let die. I am grateful to live in a country that helps countries like Somalia, until they spit in our face. Don't forget, the reason we were there was to feed the starving people of that country, and bring some kind of stability to it. But there are people out there with so little respect for human life, that they allow people to starve to death just to be able to control them. Think about that next time you're complaining about OUR gov. while you're on your way to [insert fast food restaurant here] to buy food that's probably going to give you heart disease anyways. You've got an easy life built upon the graves of others, so cherish the freedom they have purchased with their very blood. That was always the best way to honor them anyways.<br />Oh, and if you've never been in combat, it's probably best not to comment on how realistic this movie is, because you insult those who have. Thanking you in advance.
B00005T30L|5.0|This review replaces the one that seconded criticism of the last two scenes as being out of place and contrary to the narrative flow. That was exactly my sentiment after viewing the film in the theater, when it first came out in 2001. However, recently I saw it again, this time on DVD, and to my greatest amazement discovered the true last scene. It was a short \\"cartoonish\\" version of Seymour's convenience store fight (but with a different outcome) that popped out after the final credits. I don't know if that scene was a part of the theatrical release, since by the time it should have appeared on the screen I had already left the hall, as most other viewers did, but the scene does bring an unusual twist, resulting in a more effective ending, especially when connected with a momentous expression on the face of Seymour's therapist closing the door behind him and his mother. The \\"new\\" ending was so unexpected, that I first thought something was wrong with the DVD. Anyway, in light of the above discovery, I must retract my prior little disapproval and give back one star I took away because of it. This film is a gem, remarkable in its originality and warmth. Just do not rush for an exit or turn off your player when the final credits start rolling.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|What a band, and what a CD! Im a huge Corrs fan i have all the albums and this one is magnificent...its a must have if ur a Corrs fan. If your new to the Corrs this is the CD you want because it has all the greatest hits from their past 4 albums, and two great new songs.<BR>You will be blown away by Andrea's vocals in all of her songs. She is one of the best singers of the 90's in my opinion. <BR>Most of their songs are love songs and they are all really good and have meaning to them.<BR>Anyway as i said this CD is a must!! for all people even if ur not a Corrs fan...A CD like this can brighten up your day.
6304082428|5.0|I loved Pride and Predjudice. From what I hear the DVD version is horrible but the VHS is worth your buy. It was so exiting the picture was perfect in the movie. We rented the movie from the library and loved it, so check it out in the VHS version if you aren't sure about buying it. My dad watch it three times through already and that is a 6 part series so he watched 18 movies. Everyone must see this movie, its so romantic in a good way. I saw this once through and I had to buy it.
B000067CQK|4.0|\\"Ziggy Stardust\\" is one of the greatest rock 'n roll albums ever and this collection is worth the celebration. Finely remastered, the entire CD is crisp and perfect. The 12 additonial songs of demos and B-sides are great period pieces. \\"Velvet Goldmine\\", \\"Sweet Head\\" and the outtakes of \\"Moonage Daydream\\" are nothing less than ear candy.<br />However, all of this could have been released on a single CD. There is no need (other than quantity) to put all the extra songs on an additonal disc. The liner notes are detailed and fun, but the packaging is cardboard and mine is already falling apart, much like the ill-fated gem rerelease of George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\".<br />It's classic music, but the price is far too much to pay. It's also worth noting that for the 30th anniversary , Bowie only sang one song from this album in his 2002 summer tour with MOBY. What's up with that? We still 'luv ya' David!
B00005QG9J|4.0|k so its not like old incubus and thats ok. not as good as science or anything but i mean come on not much can compare right? if youre more into the really old incubus tho like fungus amongus incubus its not like that at all. its a lot more mellow.  and ok some of the songs lyrics aren't that great. the music is good but sometimes the lyrics get kind of un-climatic like...goodbye nice to know you over and over. but when i'm in certain moods i really like this cd. i mean thats why i love incubus so much is cuz they always have SOMETHING from one of their albums to offer when youre in almost any mood. its great. but depending on your taste it might not be for you.

B00004BZ16|2.0|Alright. Let me start out by saying I am a *huge* Clash fan. They are my favorite band of all time, and I can't get enough of them. I literally own every single Clash album they ever officially put out (yes, I even bought Cut The Crap for the sole purpose of owning them all). And, well... I seriously hate to say this, but this album is awful.<br />I must say I am extremely surprised that practically everybody on amazon.com has rated this album and phrased it as being terrific, but it's not. Yes, it goes into much more musical genres then London Calling ever did, but does that make this good? No. I still give this album 2 stars because it does have a few good songs, like Police On My Back, Charlie Don't Surf, and The Magnificent Seven. But for the most part, this album is [bad].<br />I've heard it said that there is one good album contained in Sandinista, so I decided to go out and make it myself. After compiling all the good songs, I made a CD that was 6 tracks long. 6, out of what, something like 36? That's terrible. I have to warn any Clash fan, new or old, that they should avoid this album and only buy it as I did for the purpose of owning every Clash album.<br />Again, I can't stress how much I love the Clash. Had they never released this album, or maybe an EP with a few good songs, it would have been much better. But this is just random, all-over-the-place, 100% grade-A, American garbage. And it pains me to call the Clash garbage, but it's the sad truth.<br />So save your money. If you're a Clash fan you probably already own London Calling, Rope, and selftitled. Well, don't buy this. ...
1558216847|5.0|Book, you are just going to buy, is one written by a polish author. However I had to wait 46 yaers since first english edition to be able to read it in polish. Thanks to very good translation I had a great time following trails of this few convicts who succeded in wriggling out of living in soviet kolkhoz. The begining is like in Kafka's \\"Trial\\" - Slavomir R. like Joseph K. is charged with something he not only didn't do, but isn't even told what it was. Then it is slightly similar to a part of Archer's \\"Kane and Abbel\\", but much more realistic, because Rawicz have had expierienced kolkhoz himself. And finally after escape its typical advanture or travel book which is thrilling and makes you read it untill the very end, without stops.
B00005R87Q|4.0|I had a dream about VIN the night after I saw this movie. He came by and picked me up in his rice car, and that bratty chick who played his girlfriend wasn't anywhere around. We went riding, and I got to press the button on the nitrous oxide thing that made the car blow out and jack up to 140 mph. NEAT. :)<br />ahhh.<br />but seriously:<br />VIN has a certain something that is going to bring him far in the action hero biz.  This movie was NOT about the SCREENPLAY. nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  Nor was it about the wimpy, surfer dude cop who infiltrated Vin's inner group, after proving himself when everyone else was home drinking malt liquor and fooling around, FORSAKING their leader. SHOCKING SCENE, THAT.<br />Are you getting the picture yet that you go to see this movie, or buy or rent it, for  the sheer fun of it? It's all stunts ( very good stunts...) and action, and it's all VIN VIN VIN.<br />There hasn't been an action hero like him since Arnie in his prime, and I anticipate a fabulous future for him, as for some reason he radiates honesty and goodness (which means kids will like him too, like Spiderman), as well as charisma and........MUSCLE.<br />thanks, jean

B0000640VO|1.0|This movie insults the Blessed Mother, in that it is stated one character, \\"hates the phrase; fruit of Thy womb.\\" Anatomical drawings of the uterus, etc. are interspersed with Marian images.

B00005QCYD|4.0|After being wowed when I was a lot younger by the original Jurassic Park, and then being completely disappointed by The Lost World, I went into Jurassic Park 3 not knowing what to expect, and I came out pleasently surprised.  Sam Neill returns (thank God, he was great in the first film) as paleontologist Alan Grant who, along with his assistant, is hired to be a guide for a seemingly wealthy couple played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni.  We soon find out that the couple are really looking for they're son who is stranded on Isla Sorna, the island that The Lost World took place on.  While the storyline is predictable, and the ending is overly hokey and corny, the fast paced action and suspense make JP3 work.  The special effects have really come a long way since the first two films, the dinosaurs look so real you can reach out and touch them.  The DVD is packed with special features, most of which you'll dig if dinosaurs are your thing.  All in all, JP3 may not be as good as the original film, but it sure beats Lost World.
B00004Z459|5.0|I think that Linkin Park is a band whom varies everything, from emotions, to even nearly changing genres sometimes. I just got Hybrid Theory a few months ago, and no matter how many times I listen to it I never get tired of it. Linkin Park changed me from liking music from artists like DMX, and Nelly, to Nickleback, Default and of course Linkin Park. Here are a few ratings and comments for each song:<br />Papercut- This song is an enjoyable one, and is missing nearly nothing! I rate it 9/10<br />One Step Closer- I think that One Step Closer is an great song but it is quite short and give it an 8/10<br />With You- I find this song on the boring side, with not much excitement so I believe it deserves a 7/10<br />Points of Authority- This is a very exhilarating song, with catchy lyrics, I would give it a 10/10<br />Crawling- This song is kind of slow but has enthusiasm, 9/10<br />Runaway- It has a lot of rhyming and is a good song, 8/10<br />By Myself- This is an AWESOME song with loads of emotion and a well written, Mike and Chester do an excellent job on this song! It's a shame I couldn't give them more than a perfect score but here is 10/10<br />In The End- This song is very easy listening, but doesn't let them show thier full potential. Still it is a good song, 9/10<br />A Place For My Head- I like the lyrics to this song and overall it is great! 9/10<br />Forgotten- Forgotten is well sung and sounds good, 8/10<br />Cure for the Itch- I do enjoy some instrumentals, my younger brother is fond of this song, I don't personally like it but it's a refresher or &quot;Music Sorbet&quot; after the screaming of the other songs. It is important so I'll give it a 7/10<br />Pushing Me Away- They made a good song to end the album, a nice moderate one, still with emotion but a softer ending, 9/10<br />Even though if you average out my scores you wouldn't get a 10/10, I would award the entire album that!
B00000251N|5.0|You may not believe in God. You dont't even have to.<BR>But this music on this CD is bringing you right up there, if you want it or not....Neil Diamond creates feelings with his music, feelings that guide you trough life. Jonathan Livingston Seagul makes you wanna fly, it even makes you fly aswell, it sets you free (of wordly stress ) an brings you in a state of mind of sheer joy and peacefulness with music and only very little vocal support from Neil, music that must find its origin in god, who created through Neil, or if you don't believe this, from something extremely positive and good ....if you listen now, in 2002, you will agree that this music is timeless for reasons, i told you before...don't believe me, but just buy this album and you'LL know what i mean...<br />and especially...enjoy it as I do, still every day.<BR>have fun with it and a good life.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time! The computerization was amazing. It looks almost real. The textures of the monsters, and especially Boo. She looks like a real toddler. I was so happy when I heard it was coming out on video. I have been wanting and waiting for it to come out since the first time I saw it at the movies. If you haven't seen it yet, do not wait. It is a good heart filled movie with good laughs and funny lines. Good for kids of any age!
B000022TSY|5.0|I had just gotten back from Viet Nam when this came out (69)... I understood it then and still love it's theme of 'freedom'... When Peter had the idea for this movie and Dennis jumped in, they were making a movie showing what was happening with the youth of the 60's that was truely great... Peter's line, toward the end, &quot;We blew it!&quot; showed how money and desire for material wealth ruined the movement... This is a historical movie telling of the dreams of a lot of us baby boomers... I will continue to watch this DVD, and think of how the world could be now with Peace, Love and Sharing and not following someone elses design for society... A fantastic movie made exactly as it should have been made by exactly who had to make it... Wish I was there again... ~~~Peace and Love~~~
B000069CWE|4.0|This CD is pretty much what I expected. When you start chopping up finely tuned songs and adding rap vocals, something will go awry. Luckily, the damage isn't too bad. It starts with a nice string quartet playing a very NIN-esque number. Hmm, nice way to start off.<br />Good songs (by my standards) on this album.<BR>Track 2: PTS.OF.ATHRTY (the only one I can actually spell) - nice technoish backdrop. it doesn't change the feel of the song too much, but it really enhances the song.<br />Track 6: (pushing me away) - Very similar to track 2.<br />Track 7: (place for my head) - Brings CD skipping music to new highs. Good mix.<br />Track 11: (with you) - Gives the song a more dynamic texture, more reverb, bleeps and bloops occationally (sp?), electro-industrial. Piano mixes into it well. The rap vocals are actually not too bad (and I don't even like rap all that much).<br />Track 13: PPR:KUT (so I can spell this too) - Like CD skipping music? This is your cup of tea. My brain feels chopped up after this. If you can deal with the rap vocals in this one, its awesome.<br />Track 14: RNW@Y - This track is very Blue Man Group. It reminds me of the Perfect Dark soundtrack as well. It has a cool techno-electro hybrid sound to it. The effects on the bass (?) that sound sort of a like a wah guitar is really cool!<br />Track 15: MY<DSMBR - This is a minimal soundscape, just like the original song. This time though it blends in some electro-industrial reminicent of NIN's \\"down in it\\" or \\"slipping away\\". Still it keeps it all very light and airy, not to dark, but still just a hint of evil. This is my favorite song on the album.<br />Track 17: BY_MYSLF - This track has a cool vintage electro sound to it. Hearing analog drum hits from every direction and little bleeps and bloops. It sounds crowded, but well layered.<br />Track 19: (one step closer) - This track has a progressive rock sound mixed with the electro-industrial soundscapes of Trent Reznor. It starts off in Pink Floyd fashion with just a synth soundscape. Then it gets processed like like Infovein (try mp3.com, sorry for the refference, but thats pretty much what it sounds like).<br />Track 20: KRWLNG - Sherpa style! Like tibetan drones? Well, it might be short of those, but it has a very sherpan style (eh... yeah...). Very progressive, builds through the whole song. Like the quartet intro? Theres more here! The only thing I can think of that sounds like this is Rhea's Obsession (try metropolis-records).<br />Bad songs - skip these:<br />Track 3: ENTH E ND - This is a massacre of the original! Listen if you want, but be warned!<br />Track 9: (high voltage) - NOOOO! This sounds like hardcore rap that just sampled a riff. The lyrics are retarded an just scrapes for rhymes.<br />---<br />The rest of the songs are good, but not really great. Sort of mediocre. Remove the two bad songs and I give it a 5. But with 15 other tracks that are good, its still a great purchase!<br />A lot of fans don't like this remix album. It's really obvious why. The fans come from so many different directions. Punk, Metal, Industrial, Rock, Rap, Techno (in the loose sense). Although Linkin Park doesn't please everybody all the time, they certainly do a pretty good job of it. With this release, they focus more on only three of the genres: Industrial, Rap, and Techno.<br />Personally I think they have great strength in this area, and should stick totally to the electro-industrial style. It isn't the most lucrative market, but this is what they are best at.
0553129961|5.0|First, I will state up front that John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. In this novel Steinbeck atypically writes about life in a town in the east, one somewhere on the lower New England coast. The depth of the characters, a Steinbeck trademark, is present here in spades. His protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is one of the most thoroughly well written characters that you can find. His wife Mary, his boss Marullo, his friend at the bank next store Joey-boy, his wife's friend Margie Young-Hunt, his kids (maybe especially his kids)... are all so vividly displayed that it's easy to forget that this is a fictitious town filled with fictitious people. The subject matter easily matches the character's depth... the difficulty in a modern world, full of all kinds of pressures, to remain moral and honest in the face of an easier way out. (Although written in the early 60s, the relevance to current headlines is obvious). Suffice to say that Steinbeck is one of the great writers of all time and all his copious skills are on display here. Very highly recommended.
B00004XQ83|4.0|This is the CD to buy to get the beginnings of a feel for bluegrass.  If this spurred a new revival of this clasic music then you should hear this CD over and over.  In my opinion it's a little dark.  I prefer &quot;happy music&quot; but the bluegrass on this disc is real, and it conveys feeling and emotion which, in this case, is a little mournful and sad.  And for those of us with short attention spans the various artists mixed in this ablum is varied enough to keep us interested.  It's a great starting point for any new bluegrass enthusiast.
B000003C2U|4.0|To me this is definetly Death at their best all though some<BR>would love to disagree. THe drumming is awesome I just can't<BR>say enough good things about it. A heavy sound very technical,<BR>but intense enough not to become boring. \\"Lack Of Comprehension\\"<BR>is perhaps the best track on here- the guitar work in the <BR>begining is very Al Dimeola-esque. Hinting at contemperary jazz before punching you in the face with heavy,slapping double bass.<BR>I think the only thing this suffers from is predictable song structures- they all seem to fall in the same formula. With one exception- listen to the last song \\"Vacant Planets\\"- its pretty off kilter- another fave. Overall- this is a highly innovative<BR>death metal lp that is sure to become a classic.
B000068QY7|5.0|Well, I will begin this review by saying that my english is not very good so I'll try to write the best that I can, thank you. I am sick and tired of hearing all the \\"Oasis are hacks, rip-offs the beatles, bla bla bla, for god sake, just listen to 3/4 of the rock in the 60s and 70s, more than 90% of the bands sounded like them everytime. Sure The Beatles were a once in a lifetime music experience and so as many other bands of any decade, Oasis is just making the music they wanna play the most, classic rock. And they play it very well on this new album, Heaven Chemistry is..for me at least just as good as Morning glory, I simply LOVE this album, \\"Hindu Times\\", \\"She is love\\", \\"Songbird\\", \\"Little by Little\\" \\"Better Man\\" are just some of the WONDERFUL tracks on this gem of an album. <br />The Gallaghers have surpassed themselves on this one, thank you for another excellent album Oasis, we will never forget!<br />DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS AND BE YOUR OWN JUDGE, HAVE YOUR OPINION ABOUT IT!, if you don't like it, fine but don't say what everyone is saying because Oasis is not popular like they were in the mid-90s or so. <br />An incredible album, 5 stars!
B00000ADG2|4.0|I love Lauryn Hill and I always will. But after listening to her &quot;Unplugged&quot; album and seeing her this year at Smokin' Grooves, I think I wanna stick to living in the past and keep bumping this record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.<br />In case you didn't realize it, 1998 was when hip-hop/rap was acceptable to EVERYONE. Back then, you didn't deserve to have any friends if you didn't play The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Vol. 2 Hard Knock Life or It's Dark and Hell is Hot at your parties. In fact, the inclusion of Lauryn's smash, &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot;, on radio playlists helped get Jay-Z and DMX on the radio and MTV.<br />Never before have I heard a woman who could sing AND rap great (Mystic would come years later). From the reggae-influenced &quot;Lost Ones&quot; (no, it's not about Wyclef, contrary to popular belief) to the very last bonus track, this album offers us a look into Lauryn's pains, loves, beliefs, and of course, talent. &quot;Every Ghetto, Every City&quot; tells about back-in-the-day situations, &quot;Superstar&quot; criticizes wack emcees, and &quot;To Zion&quot; is a great tribute to her seed. The duet with Mary J. on &quot;I Used to Love Him&quot; is also stellar (check out the subtle sample of Raekwon's &quot;Ice Cream&quot; in that song).<br />The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is by no means a perfect album, as evidenced on the unnecessary hip-hop/R&amp;B remake of &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off of You&quot; and on the lazy sounds of the D'Angelo duet, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;. But those flaws are very minor compared to the overall greatness of this album. I don't know if Lauryn will ever be this great again, because now she's an emotional wreck and a certain individual named India Arie Simpson took over her role as &quot;black female singer/songwriter with a guitar&quot;. But Lauryn, you have a fan for life.
6305718954|5.0|i was not expecting much when i finally decided to watch this movie.  i actually watched it because billy corgan does the music, so that drew me.<BR>but it was so sweet.  patricia arquette blew me away.  she was beautiful at  times and horrid at other times.  one scene she wil really scare you.<BR>the only negatives for this movie are the intense demonic scenes and the scenes where patricia is crucified. they are pretty messed up <BR>but overpowered strongly by the story, filming strength, acting, and even billy corgan's music.
B000002ADT|5.0|Everyone says this is the best jazz album ever. I've got to agree -- Miles is in fine form, and Coltrane & Cannonball play excellently.  \\"So What\\" and \\"All Blues\\" have catchy two-note riffs.  This was Miles' second \\"revolutionary\\" album, and merely the midpoint of a long, strong career.
B00003CXWV|3.0|johnny depp is one of my favorites and he does a great job and is entertaining as ever to watch in this film.  the beginning of the film in the sixties is fun.  but the movie gets long and at times seems to drag.   towards the end depp gets a fake beer belly- and it really looked fake to me.  so that also annoyed me.<BR>not my favorite film ever, but certainly a good one. <BR>i would recommend it   -and you will even find a great moral message inside the objectional content.
B000005H40|4.0|This is simply a jazz classic. The songs and the playing come together for Coltrane in this album. A must-have for Coltrane, saxophone, or jazz fans.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|the film had a interesting story.  i will give it that.  but it isn't quick to let you in on its secrets, so i started to lost interest.  <BR>is this film as good as most people say?   <BR>four stars from me.
B000003N7G|4.0|This album represented a shift on Coltrane's part to longer songs and looser song structures.  Even though some people adore this album, I think it's merely \\"very good\\" because it doesn't grab me as strongly as some of his other stuff.
B00006674X|5.0|This film is not all that bad. I thought that it was rather nice to see Elvis as a no BS kind of guy that tells the three Nuns about the outs of working in an inner city doctors office. I Think that Elvis was at his best in this film.<br />It shows Mary Tyler Moore and 2 other ladies as nuns and they try to blend in with the outside world. Just when things start looking up, Mary Tyler Moore winds up in love with Elvis. <br />This film touches on 2 other subjects.. Rage Tharapy... Working with the little girl... I wonder if there is any truth if that really works. Rape is another touchy subject... I would prescreen this before showing this to younger Elvis fans out there.<br />Elvis loooked handsome in this one! I could not take my eyes off the screen... He had this look that you could not resist. I thought that this was worth a look... Rent it and see for your own opinion. If you like it... By all means, but it for your collection.
630460291X|2.0|I saw this Robin Hood adaptation and I just didn't like it, it's just another big budget Hollywood movie with a bad script and a lot of overacting. I find it amusing reading the reviews by Kevin Costner fans all hot under the collar because other reviewers said his English accent was horrible or that he didn't even use an English accent but used his American accent and one person was like the Old English language doesn't' sound like modern day English, blah, blah, blah! Yes, that may be the case but I seriously doubt that people in Historical England sounded like Americans and you can bet that Old English sounded closer to Modern English spoken in England today than English spoken with our American accents! The fact remains that some people like this movie for various reasons and some people dislike it for various reasons as well, just accept that not every one is going to like what you like and dislike what you dislike, I dislike this movie but I accept that other people like it, afterall everyone is entitled to their own opinion! Different strokes for different folks!
014043786X|4.0|When I was a kid I used to read about a detective named Encyclopedia Brown.  In these stories you were entertained with an action filled plot and given critical bits of info about each case, and the fun part was figuring out who the villian was.  Very fun and very challenging books.  Well when I happened upon Mr. Sherlock and his demonic hound case I found a glorified version of young enclyopedia set in 19th Century London...and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The story offers suspense and mystery, and challenges you to beat Sherlock to the solution.  It challenged me enough that I went out and bought the complete set of Holmes' Stories...and I am gonna figure at least one of them out.<br />I deducted a star simply because I read it in between books like 'Grapes of Wrath', 'Catcher in the Rye', and '1984' which must, necessarily, be rated higher.  But none-the-less, I think you will be thoroughly entertained and challenged by what you read!
B00005N919|4.0|I think this movie works, even after the passage of time, because the plot provides a true mystery, it was filmed beautifully, has a timeless, lush score, and basically exposes us to the most basic of instincts in a completely candid and passionate manner, and is therefore a treat for all the senses.<br />Remembered best for the interrogation scene, re-watching the films recalls the intricacies of the who-dunit factor and rekindles the heat generated by the sexual and mental interplay between the cool calculating character created by Stone and the  bright, but confused character who is constantly exuding simmering raw sexuality, brilliantly portrayed by Douglas.<br />The frankness and specific details of the many 'sex-scenes' makes one wonder even more than ever why so much has been made of the touching and beautifully filmed sexual scene in the recently released film 'Monster's Ball'.<br />The Unrated Collector's Edition DVD of 'Basic Instinct' contains many interesting features; the best of which was a relaxed but informative commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven and PD Jan De Bont.  Not only do they provide a very interesting and fact-filled commentary about the making of the film, the background info on why and how certain scenes were shot, details about location data, and references contained in the film related to the master, Alfred Hitchcock; but they also give us inside information about the cast; their personal reactions to their roles, the intimate details of the shooting of the complex sex depictions, technical details about filming the bloody and violent murders, as well as other small but oh-so-revealing tidbits that make us movie-goers feel like real insiders.<br />Conversely, the commentary by feminist critic Camille Paglia was a stern, passionless-reading of a seemingly written-text by an individual with a very obvious agenda.  It is always interesting to be exposed to differing opinions, but in this particular case Ms. Paglia has an affinity for telling viewers in fairly biased language 'what' they are seeing.  While a director can tell us 'why' a scene was shot a certain way, lit in a particular manner, contained specific language, etc., the viewer is left to draw their personal opinions as to the intent of the final product.  Whereas, Ms. Paglia consistently describes for the viewer what a particular scene is portraying based on her personal prospective only, as she has no part in the actually 'making' of the film.  This commentary may or may not be interesting based on the viewer's point of view and/or their patience and/or tolerance to hear a different viewpoint.  The good thing about this, as with all 'special features', is that it is there if you are interested, but it isn't mandatory if you are not.<br />The 'ice-pick' pen is a 'cute' selling promo.  The package, as mentioned by some other reviewers has a problem.  If you inspect the hinges carefully, you will note thare is simply no clearance for 'opening' the hinge; best to remove the cover as if changing the jewel case on a CD.<br />All in all this was well worth the price to retrospectively view a visually beautiful, mentally stimulating, candidly sexual film, and additionally to gain insight into its creation.  If you saw it originally, step back in time to be reminded of what you may have forgotten over the years.  If you have never watched 'Basic Instict' find out what all the up-roar was about when the film was originally shot and released.telling viewers in fairly biased language 'what' they are seeing.

B000006V31|5.0|Leaf Hound was formed from the ashes of Black Cat Bones who added Keith Young on drums and continued on under a new name in 1971. Other members included vocalist Peter French, guitarist Mick Halls, and the Brooks brothers Derek and Stu on guitar and bass respectively. The band's only album contained an acid guitar based psychedelic sludgefest of blues based rock. The band sounded like a raw combination of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Tracks which stand out include \\"Freelance Fiend\\", \\"Stray\\" and \\"Sawdust Caeser\\". However, the entire cd is good. French's vocals fit the mood of the set perfectly. The set has some solid acid guitar playing but nothing really fancy. This reissue also includes two bonus tracks, a non-lp single b-side and a previously unissued track. It is worth noting that vocalist Peter French was later a member of progressive rockers Atomic Rooster, the power boogie band Cactus and the German band Randy Pie. He also unsuccessfully auditioned for Deep Purple after Ian Gillan left the band but David Coverdale was hired instead. This is a highly recommended reissue of powerhouse psychedelic blues based British rock. The original lp is exremely rare so buy this reissue before it goes out of print again.
B0000039QA|5.0|LET'S ALL BE HONEST BIGGIE IS JUST PLAIN NICE THIS ALBUM IS A TRUE TESTAMENT ABOUT HOW GREAT A RAPPER OR A REAL MC THAT BIGGIE WAS HIS LYRIC'S WERE SICK HIS FLOW GAVE YOU GOOSEDUMPS IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT BEAT.

B0000024ZC|5.0|People seem to never agree on what the best Gentle Giant album is. Any one given album from their second, Acquiring the Taste, up to Free Hand, has been given status as the best Gentle Giant album. In my book, it's Three Friends, their third album. It's their first album released in Columbia here in America. The album was originally released in the UK on the famous &quot;swirl&quot; vertigo label with a different cover. The American version of Three Friends uses the same cover as their 1970 debut (since their debut received no US release since Vertigo didn't have a liscence to operate in the US until the following year), wrongly showing original drummer Martin Smith who departed after their second album to be replaced by Malcolm Mortimore, who only appears on this album. Regardless, Three Friends is stuffed with more great prog gems like the &quot;Prologue&quot;, &quot;School Days&quot;, &quot;Working All Day&quot;, and &quot;Mister Class and Quality&quot;. Parts of &quot;Peel the Paint&quot; oddly reminds me of the American band It's a Beatiful Day circa Marrying Maiden (especially the violin). The title track reminds me of the Moody Blues with similar vocal harmonies and Mellotron. The album is a concept dealing with three friends growing up as kids but separated in adulthood over clashing lifestyles (the artist, the blue collar construction worker, and the white collar office worker) where they no longer seem to see eye to eye. This album is truly one of the greats of prog rock. Rock critics hated them because the band refused to make compromises, but the prog rock fans enjoyed them quite a lot, and for good reason. They are one of the few prog rock bands outside of Yes, ELP, Genesis, etc. that I met more than my fair share of people who actually heard of. Three Friends is a classic and if you like prog rock, get this album.
B00005A46T|5.0|Well it has almpst been a year and IOWA still sounds as brutal and groundbreaking as the day I brought it. I was a fan of Slipknot before the hype and one thing I loved about this band was the fact that they had more of an old school vibe and energy to their sound. If you listen to a lot of Death Metal you can hear the bands that influence them. As it looks like Pantera are ready to call it a day, I can safely say that to me Slipknot are like the new Pantera, in the sense that they did it all on their own merrit. They didn't have big record labels pushing them along and did it from the underground. Enough about that and on to Iowa. Well not a dull moment on the album. I was a little scared when I brought this that it would be more commercial, but Slipknot know all about the metal way of life. I think their age is a bonus. Well done. Where we go from here will be an interesting journey.
B000002VCT|4.0|I was five years old in 1978 when Pyramid came out. I can still remember songs like &quot;Can't Take It With You&quot; and &quot;Pyramania&quot; being played on the radio of my dad's Volkswagen Microbus he had at that time. Flash forward to 1984 and he buys The Best of the Alan Parsons Project, and on there were the two songs. But I wanted to get the original album those songs originally came off, and eventually I got this album, Pyramid. Well, I have to say, unsurprisingly, this album is just one notch below I Robot, but this still remains a rather consistent offereing of great tunes. Excellent orchestrated progressive pop with goodies like the instrumental &quot;Voyage&quot;, &quot;What Goes Up&quot;, &quot;The Eagle Will Rise Again&quot;, another instrumental, &quot;In the Lap of the Gods&quot; (with a strong Egyptian bent to the music), and the electronic &quot;Hyper Gamma Spaces&quot;. I have always liked &quot;Can't Take It With You&quot;, even when I was 5 and knew nothing about music, but I thought the lyrics to &quot;Pyramania&quot; was rather silly, about pyramid obsession. That song is basically a short pop song. This album is quite good, but if you're new to the Alan Parsons Project, try I Robot first.
B000067CPX|5.0|I must say there was a time we werent sure they were still making great music, specifically with 1995's letdown \\"One Hot Minute\\". Even \\"Californication\\" took awhile to catch on. But \\"By The Way\\" is incredible, from start to end, just like 1991's \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\". 11 years later, the Chili's are fresh as ever, notably the fact guitarist John Frusciante kicked his near death battle with heroin, and their Producer Rick Rubin (may as well call him the 5th member of the band). Don't listen to the naysayers, the ones who are still stuck in a time capsule from 1985 (many of whom we all went to Fairfax High with here in L.A.) Just go out and get this album, you wont regret it!!
B00005OMTT|2.0|I am a big Enigma fan and love listening to their music.<br />Didn't care for the feel of this CD.  The ambiance created by listening straight through an Enigma CD was lost in this collection.

B00005JKNF|5.0|To call this film a murder mystery or a whodunit is somewhat of a misleading understatement. The form and structure of the movie follows that archetypical mystery structure, but the film is one of the most remarkable commentaries on class and family in a bygone era captured by camera. Credit Julian Fellows for his excellent screenplay. The script captures the era, the atmosphere and mannerisms of the people inhabiting it to a perfect pitch, and Robert Altman is as game as ever in transposing Fellows' vision to film as only he can. This is definitely Altman's best film since \\"The Player\\". Ensemble acting is superb; the actors are unselfish in a refreshingly anti-Hollywood way. It brings a smile to my face to see a film that treats the subject matter of the story with more reverence than the actors' egos. The disc itself is gorgeous; the commentaries and special features are generous and edifying - they enrich the understanding of the film. You can't lose with this disc.
0452281881|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I've ever read; no matter how many times you read it, it never gets old.  Matt Beaumont wrote a sequel called \\"The E Before Christmas\\" that hasn't been published in the US, but is available from Amazon UK. It's almost as good.
6305657947|4.0|Unlike the 1968 version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\", this newer version is a much more complex take on the story. Due to the restriction of film in the 1960s, the movie is much more smart and witty than sexual and sexy. Kissing the limit of erotica in the movie but as for the 1999 version, you get the package of male fun. More than kissing is shown; nudity is a strong point in this film (that's right, Rene Russo gets topless and it is not ugly). <br />Although this version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" is much for complex and \\"full-length\\", I'd still recommend the older version more.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I first heard these guys when I was enroute to a Radiohead concert last year. It was very mindblowing because up until that time, I never really heard anything like this before in my entire existence. The beauty that resonated in every note, the falsetto vocals, the most innovative guitar work to be done with a violin bow since Jimmy Page (though this is more ambient than hard rock), I fell in love with it. I bought the CD, put it on and just sat there completely dazed for the next hour or so.<BR><BR>Tracks 2, 3 and 7 are tearjerkers... I remember just sitting there in awe. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It's another one of those albums that paints a portrait. It's also the type of music that I heard in my head periodically and all of the sudden I heard it, and it sounded better than I had ever imagined.<BR><BR> You have to be in the right frame of mind for this album though. If you listen to it when you're not in the mood for it, you can't really absorb the beauty of it at all. But when you are in the mood for it, it's a divine experience.
B000056K04|5.0|&quot;Everyday&quot; is a great achievement for the Dave Matthews Band. From the first track to the last it is a great ensemble of modern popular music, but of the good kind. This is one of the most creative bands on the scene today and like their previous works, &quot;Everyday&quot; proves it with every song. The opening, &quot;I Did It,&quot; is energetic, a cool hybrid of rock, pop and little touches of jazz. One of the band's best cuts. &quot;When The World Ends&quot; follows with a wonderful melodic, emotional feeling and neat lyrical play. Lead singer Dave Matthews soars and scores with his unique, jazzy, rich vocal quality and a first effort with electric guitar that proves electrifying. This is shown in &quot;I Did It&quot; and also in a truly emotional way with &quot;The Space Between,&quot; a beautiful, captivating ballad that may bring up those feelings you have for a special someone. The lyrics are also poetic and captivating. &quot;Everyday&quot; is not a retread to their previous release, &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; (a masterpiece featuring classics like &quot;Rapunzel&quot; and &quot;The Last Stop&quot;) but an expansion of their skill as a band. Drummer Carter Beauford plays rhythms that make him one of the best modern drummers around while Leroi Moore's sax wails and sails. Other notable tracks include &quot;What You Are,&quot; which has a hint of Matthews going back to his roots with the Eastern feel and &quot;Mother Father,&quot; one of the albums timeless, best cuts which features special guest Carlos Santana who adds a musical beauty with his guitar. Dave Matthews Band is a wonderful audio experience because of the hybrid nature of the music, so rockerish but jazzy with touches of pop that make it able to compete with the likes of Creed (another really good band) and Britney Spears (please...). &quot;Everyday&quot; is one of their best albums and in hearing it alongside their new &quot;Busted Stuff,&quot; it is a great promise of things to come.
0345448898|4.0|To some up the entire expirience in one word.  Wow.  As seems to be a genre turn most science fiction books today are dealing with destorying one god or another.. ((See also Dragons of a Vanished moon)  At anyrate I started this serries when i was a sophmore in Highschool and am just now getting around to finishing it.   It is deffinatly one of the most inventive stories of its time, and the explanation of Daemons in the last book just makes the serries incredibly believable..  The only thing i was disappointed with was the ending.. I guess much like Dickens original ending of Great expectations..  The book deffinatly sends the reader through the full range of emmotions and was deffinatly entertaining.  I'd suggest this book for anyone with the capacity of reason..  :)
B00004T8RK|5.0|It seems pointless to write a review merely as a response to another review given the fact that music is hardly a thing to be critiqued, yet that aside, I feel it necessary to shed some light on Binaural. A previous reviewer berated this album and claimed to be a huge fan of the band within the same paragraph. I disagree with this review, I am of the opinion that Binaural is Pearl Jam's best release to date.<br />Light Years, Insignificance and Sleight of Hand are enough reason to buy this CD. They are introspective mature songs whose aim is not simply to create a beat and vent through distored guitars. There are also beautfully written slow songs on this (Thin Air, Parting Ways) album which more than anything represent the bands growth and maturity. There are faster guitar based songs that are also integral to the album. This release is not &quot;Ten&quot;, nor is it a tired attempt at rehashing the same guitar solos, emotion or radio playability as &quot;Ten&quot; (That was almost 12 years ago, music and people change). Pearl Jam's days of making &quot;rock anthems&quot; are as far behind them as are their other abandoned cliches: waist length hair, and the need to make a video for every song they release. Many bands are in the biz simply to profit and remain icons; Pearl Jam, in my opinion make music because it's what they do best and they do so from somewhere deep within. The fruit of Pearl Jam's labors is evident on Binaural as is their apparent choice to make solid music instead of here today gone tomorrow fan pleasing pop.<br />If Pearl Jam's November 2002 release is close to as good as Binaural, I will treasure it. If none of the songs get radio play, it will say something huge for the album when compared to the glut of mediocrity currently in constant circulation. Thank You Pearl jam... Binaural is superb.
B000001ESF|5.0|Though Rush had 3 albums before 2112, this is the one where their true sound and what would make the band in the coming years comes together. It is raw Rock &amp; Roll refined. Rush experiments with new sounds and ideas. Buy it! The album may take a three or four times it to get used to it, but after that, you won't put it down.<BR>The Rush fan community believes Rush's best albums are 2112 through power windows. They are all good but those are the ones fans believe everyone should have. For your info, the album orders are as follows: Rush, Fly by night, carress of steel, 2112, All The Worlds A Stage(live), A farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permenant Waves, Moving Pictures, Exist Stage Left (live), signals, grace under pressure, power windows, hold your fire, A Show of Hands (live), Presto,(chronicals released)Counter parts, Roll the Bones, Test For Echo, a final (3) disc live album. And a new Studio disc set for release in May 2002<br />A warning, if you buy this and enjoy it, Rush is addicting and as you can see. . . they have alot of albums.<br />&quot;and the meek shal inherit the earth.&quot; N.P. 2112
B000031XCR|5.0|All The Way A Decade Of Song, is the best CD of Céline Dion.. I have 4 CD's of Céline now, they are All The Way, A New Day Has Come, The Collector's Series Vol.1, and Au Coeur Du Stade... they're all great, but All The Way is the best... And as u know it im a huge Céline fan and still collecting her CD's... well trying. Anyways, below are the tracks of what I think of the songs:<br />1. The Power Of Love - A True song that shows how strong Céline's vocals are... great love song!!<br />2. If You Asked Me To - This is a moving one, a slow but sort of moving ballad, beautiful...!<br />3. Beauty and the beast - This is featured also on the Disney Movie beauty and the beast soundtrack.. i love this song! <br />4. Because you loved me - This song makes me thing of my family and friends, it is so touching! I will have this song played at my wedding, if i ever get married.<br />5. It's all coming back to me now - This song also prooves how strong Céline's vocals are, powerful song! Believe me!! On the falling into you album it is like 7 minutes long, but on here its only 5 minutes long.. i like the short version better.<br />6. Love can move mountains - an uplifiting song, great one!<br />7. To love you more - I love this one, this is a totally cool ballad love song.<br />8. My heart will go on - This is the first song i ever heard of Céline back in 1997.. when Titanic was out. This is one of my fave songs.<br />9. I'm your angel (duet with r.kelly) - this song is so cool, i love the background vocals on it, my friend she loves this song also because it has r.kelly in it...!)<br />10. That's the way it is - I am surprised to see, Céline singing a poppish fast song like this on her CD... this song is great.<br />11. If walls could talk - this one sounds sort of like a country theme song, it is totally a great ballad!<br />12. The first time i ever saw your face - This one is a very very moving slow ballad... it is romantic..<br />13. All the way (duet with frank sinatra) - this one is a re-make of mr.sinatra's song, all the way.. céline does a great duet re-make with him in this song and mr.sinatra sounds great also..<br />14. Then you look at me - This song is very good.. must listen to this one!<br />15. I want you to need me - This one is also very good...<BR>(There are remixes of it on the i want you to need me single, and that's the way it is (US CD) single..<br />16. Live - this one is another slow ballad sounds sorta like the first time i ever saw your fa ce song, but great..<br />So.... now that you've seen my review.. have yout thought about buying the CD? I hope so, cos this is the best! IT has 9 past songs and 7 new ones. Céline Dion rocks.. (she's my fave singer, and the best singer yet,, no one else can sing better than her!)
6305949980|5.0|If your second guessing this movie, this movie is simply fantastic. It's a must see, you will find yourself feeling for Jack as he goes on his quest for something differnt in his life. The music and songs are addictive. Oogie Boogie is great also....a gambling &quot;Boogie man&quot;. One of my favorites.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Its really unfortunate that everytime a band gets over-hyped the same group of small minded individuals comes out from the rock theyve been living under and trashes the album completely. This group of cynical individuals would probably like the album if they listened to it, but because they are completely averse to a band getting public adulation, they turn on it and skewer it. This is the case with The Strokes' brilliant debut album. I bought the album not expecting much and was immediately taken in by the energy and phenomenal melodies. Yes folks, this album is a classic and worthy of all the hype. I havent heard songs this beautiful in a long time. For the naysayers and bitter cynics out there it should be known that most of what I listen to is indie or indie inspired. Listen to this with an open heart and an open mind and prepare to be amazed.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This would be the ultimate to any Seinfeld fan's library!  They're putting all of these inferior shows (like the Jeffersons) out on DVD by season, but still no Seinfeld, one of the greatest shows to ever take up air time on television.  Let's hear it from all the Seinfeld fans of the world! Unite, and let the studio know that they are missing out on an opportunity!...
B00004VVNB|4.0|Coming out of the early post-Vietnam, post-hippy era containing a lot of mistrust for anyone over the age of 30, \\"Logun's Run\\" is a film portraying a post-apocolyptic world in which a large number of humanity's survivors live inside of a completely computer-controlled, domed city.  The city's residents are all young: no one lives over the age of 30.  Every resident is born and raised initially by the computer instead of having human parents, and every resident has a built in \\"life clock\\" that informs them how long they have to live within the city.  When a resident reaches the age of 30, he/she has been taught that they will be \\"renewed\\" (i.e., reborn) after they enter what is called the Carousel and die before an audience of younger, cheering city residents.  Residents who attempt to avoid the Carousel are labeled as \\"runners\\" and the central computer (which tracks all residents) calls upon the \\"sandmen\\" (a trained force of male city residents) to hunt and kill the runners.  To the sandmen, hunting and killing runners is a sport; and residents are taught that running will prevent them from being renewed.<br />The film is named for the main character, Logus 5 (played by Michael York), who is a sandman.  His best friend, Francis 7 (played by Richard Jordan), is also a sandman.  Upon the two of them hunting and killing a female runner (played by Lara Lindsay, who also provides the voice of the city computer), each is required to be debriefed by the city computer.  Logun dumps several objects onto a computer scanner and the computer begins to question him about one of the objects: an ankh.  Logun doesn't understand what the ankh is or represents, but the city computer tells him that it represents \\"sanctuary\\", a place where runners can hide from detection.  The city computer decides to use Logun to find \\"santuary\\" by reprogramming his personal \\"life clock\\" to make him appear to be 30 years old and instructing him to become a runner.  Logun, who is quite concerned aboutlosing his remaining lifetime, has no choice but to follow the instructions of the emotionless city computer.<br />Logun seeks out a young woman, Jessica 6 (played by Jenny Agutter), whom he had previously met and who wears an ankh on a necklace.  He pretends to be a runner to obtain her assistance in finding \\"sanctuary\\".  With some reservation to him being a sandman, she reluctantly decides to help him.  Together, they manage to escape the confines of the domed city and see, for the very first time in their lives, what the world outside of the city really looks like.  At first, they are scared, but they find a ruined ancient city and find an old man (played by Peter Ustinov, by far the best actor in the film) living with several hundred cats.  Finding an old man tells them that everything that they were taught in the city isn't true and they realize that they need to do something about it.<br />Models of the domed city were state-of-the-art back when this film was produced in 1976, but the numerous improvements in special effects technology over the past quarter-century has rendered the city somewhat campy in appearance.  Sets used elsewhere, as well as the special effects used in the Carousel are still quite good.  Everyone (men & women alike) within the city, except for the sandmen, wear nothing but light-weight pastel costumes reminiscent of a college toga party.<br />Some aspects of city life are not fully addressed in the film, such as current sources of food, full educational levels of the residents, and how the city computer seemingly creates the residents themselves.  Since the residents are numbered, they may be a series of clones, but degradation of DNA over multiple clone generations is not addressed in the film.<br />Overall, \\"Logun's Run\\" is a good film and would make a good addition to any DVD collection.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Who the heck is Ricky Wright?  I don't know what world he lives in, but in this one, you write about what you know well.  If John Mayer knows himself, then more power to him.  His album is light and refreshing, with great smooth tunes.  I enjoyed the change of pace from the typical teen dribble being put out these days.
B00000099Y|5.0|TOOL, is by far the best band out there today. No other vocalist can compete with Maynard, from singing duets with Tori Amos to earth shattering screams with Zack de La Rocha, he is truely amazing. But the thing about TOOL is not just Maynard, Justin Chancelor, Adam Jones, and Danny Carey are also amazing. Danny Carey is hands down the best drummer to ever touch a percussion instrument. And when you take all this and put it together to create something special that people can take within themselves and be inspired to create something as well. For all you non-believers listen to any one of their CDs, or see them in concert, and it will make you a believer. And for those people who said such bad things about them like Ditto Ellis and Self-fulfilling Prophecy, they need a metal tool slapped in their face, to help open up their little minds.
B00004R7PB|5.0|This version might not surpass Hogwood for some of you but in my opinion this version outscores them ALL.<br />This is the most brilliant, clear recorded version ever out there. Fantastic brass.<br />Conducting, music (extremly good performed by all), tempi, sound is astonishing in its professional perfection and it is joyful and personal in every sence.<br />Grammohone rank this set overall very high and in fact rank Music for the royal fireworks as the best version ever and I understand why.<br />So buy it and enjoy <BR>P.S check out Savalls versions of Bachs 6 Brandenburg concerti and Orchestral suites too because they also are extremly good.
B00000099Y|5.0|These one-star biased, uneducated 1 star reviews are disgusting.  If you dont like it because its &quot;too dark&quot; or &quot;too grim&quot; or whatever, what the hell are you doing listening to Tool?  The whole purpose of the Heavy Metal genre is to be like this and Tool does this perfectly.  If you want something lighter go listen to your Ashanti or whatever.  This CD isnt for everyone!!  OR if you need something a LITTLE less abstract, try &quot;undertow&quot; which is great, too.  AND let it grow on you. IT DOES TAKE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF TIMES for this CD to grow on you.  It didnt start to grow on me until like a month after constant listening. You have to be patient with this CD to notice everything that goes into the craft of these songs (or opuses for that matter). This is undeniably one of the masterpieces of the 90's. Thanks to careless reviews, this CD has gone from its 5-star rating (where it should be) to 4 1/2... to the levels of Backstreet Boys and Michelle Branch. Tool's better than that. YOU CANNOT DENY the raw talent of the instrumental arrangements on this album.  you just can't.  I wanna see how many people looking at these can actually tell a good CD from a bad CD. click the helpful icon if you have recieved the reward from vast repeated listens of this CD.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Well, maybe the oscar dudes have SOME taste left after all. Anyone with a good taste and a brain would've known the moment they laid eyes on the movie that it was destined to end up on a pedestal.<br />Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr., a brilliant real-life mathematician and Nobel Prize winner, now in his 70s, who's also a real-life schizophrenic. But when we first meet him as a Princeton graduate student, he's just another eccentric genius, a loner obsessed with finding a truly original idea. (He does; he writes a revolutionary paper on game theory.) <br />Director Ron Howard, working from an inventive script by Akiva Goldsman that makes use in turn of Sylvia Nasar's biography, does a crucial, and crucially understated, job of establishing the physical reality of Nash's world -- the campus, his classmates, his high-spirited roommate (Paul Bettany) -- with such authority that we feel we can taste the chalk dust on the blackboard. (Cinematographer Roger Deakins' work is as integral here as it is to the telling of ''The Man Who Wasn't There.'')<br />This tangibility is ''Beautiful Mind'''s beautiful achievement, the elegant solution to the problem of how to turn the biography of a man's head into an absorbing movie. And especially coming from Howard, a director renowned (and sometimes critically reprimanded) for pumping big gusts of inspirational wind through pictures from ''Cocoon'' to ''Apollo 13,'' this is news. Inspired, perhaps, by the existence of an actual, living Nash as well as by Crowe's superior bull-free talent, director and screenwriter have found a way to convey the sensation of schizophrenia from the inside out, not with a big raving and waving of hands but with a waiving of reality.<br />To say more about how is unwise, but I do want to say that Crowe ages as Nash ages. The academic geek who did so poorly with girls meets the beautiful student who will become his wife (Jennifer Connelly) at about the same time he meets the compelling government agent (Ed Harris) who recruits the professor to break codes. It's only long after Nash's schizophrenic break -- after he has struggled with treatment that dulls his thoughts and deadens his marriage, and after he has struggled to live with his illness on his own terms -- that this ''Mind'' gets foggy with uplift too.<br />Still, by then, the important movie work has been done: ''A Beautiful Mind'' has distinguished itself and enlightened its audience. No final speechifying and shots of Mrs. Nash's tear-glistened eyes can take away the remembered image of Crowe as a young Nash, solving equations on a windowpane, aflame with an inspiration very close to madness
0684833395|5.0|Many have tried, but Joseph Heller went ahead and wrote the Great American Novel, Catch-22. If you haven't read it, please consider putting down whatever you are reading and dive into Catch-22 instead.<BR>It's about war, sure, but more than that it's about how the mysterious thing we can Human Nature can make such a mess of things for us humans. Mr. Heller looks into the center of man and sees our fatal flaws and pours them out on page after page in an utterly hilarious way. No one has ever created so many memorable characters in a single book: Major Major Major Major, Colonel Cathcart, Milo Mindbender, and the center of this off-center universe, Captain Yossarian.<br />Read it, you'll like it. And, if you do, I also recommend most of the works of Kurt Vonnegut and my own first novel, Fate (by Mary Jane). Have a nice day.
B000065U1N|5.0|By focusing without distraction on the mission at hand, Black Hawk Down breaks out of the pack in Hollywood's long history of combat movies. It does so, in ironic screen timing, by reminding us of a battle that turned many against American troop commitment.<br />Ridley Scott's likely Oscar nominee, adapted from Mark Bowden's same-name book, extols the sheer professionalism of America's elite Delta Force - even in the unforeseen disaster that was 1993's Battle of Mogadishu.<br />In relating the conflict, in which 18 Americans died and 70-plus were injured, the standard getting-to-know-you war-film characterizations are downplayed. While some may regard this as a shortcoming, it is, in fact, a virtue, given the nuts-and-bolts movie Gladiator/Hannibal director Scott and company have elected to make.<br />If ever there were a story in which logistics should dominate, this is it - and besides, smart casting fills in the personality gaps. It's clear the movie is going to have all the human element it needs when we see that commanding Gen. William F. Garrison is played by Sam Shepard, who could have been a superstar in Hollywood's golden age of screen heroes.<br />The midtown U.N. peacekeeping mission, intended to capture two lieutenants of Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, was billed as maybe an hour's assignment. Following debacles that afflicted both air and ground forces, the ensuing firefights escalated that time frame 15-fold. The movie runs an uncommonly intense and fast-moving 144 minutes, with the final 100 devoted exclusively to what happened when bad luck, confusion and technological limitations converged.<br />No war movie I have ever seen so vividly shows battle from differing perspectives: combatants on the ground and on rooftops; others hundreds of feet above them under whirling blades; and officers in protected areas watching the debacle on video monitors, trying to figure out what to do. Plunked in the middle of all this are donkeys, cats and even children's swing sets, as if what is happening isn't surreal enough.<br />Black Hawk's knockout photography, editing and sound are all state of the art, while the ensemble performers (Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner), in contrast, are effectively subordinate to the material.

B0000060NF|5.0|Brilliant. Beautifully produced. I remember my mother listening to this on vinyl in the early 70s when it was first released. A great addition to anyone's collection. Regarding the person from N Potomac, MD below - adding \\"Heard it through the grapvine\\" would make no sense whatsoever - that was created during a totally different time period. Open your ears and mind, and realize how the more things change, the more they stay the same. The same issues being sung about still hold true 30 years later.

B00003CY0V|1.0|This really starts with a bang, the opening scene is very well done, and really blew me away. but what happens afterwards, nothing, every effrot seems to have been made creating the opening scenene, and the rest of the movie tacked on as an afterthought.<BR>Theres some really really bad performances notabley from vinnie jones and halle berry, and frankly, i could care less about a brief flash of her soft focus flesh, which seemed to be the main adolescent selling point.
031286504X|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\", by Richard Matheson, is the eerie tale of Robert Neville, a simple man who is faced with the complicated dilemma of being the last living man in a world infested with undead vampires.<br />Set in a post-war scenario, Neville is the sole survivor of a horrific biological war that has turned every person but him into blood-hungry vampires. Forced into an uncomfortable and numbing isolation, Neville is forced to live out his life in a day-to-day race to find the answers to why every person on Earth has turned into a vampire, and to stop them before they destroy him.<br />Throughout the story, Neville battles alcoholism and the immense pain of losing his wife and daughter, all while struggling to understand the plague that has transformed his family, friends, and neighbors into monsters. While Neville is no saint, Matheson offers an honest depiction of what might become of anyone who is faced with such a great burden.<br />While following Neville in his daily routine, we appreciate the magnitude of the milestone discoveries that he gradually makes. These seemingly small, but vastly important findings lead Neville to the ultimate discovery of what causes the vampirism and why he was spared the atrocity of becoming one.<br />Although Neville's education, organization, and enlightenment are extraordinary, they are countered by his realization that the vampires have been through a similar metamorphosis. This parallel adaptation between Neville and the monsters lead to a thought-provoking and surprising conclusion.<br />Captivating and full of rich detail, \\"I Am Legend\\" was a true pleasure to read. Matheson's masterful portrayal of this grim tale makes \\"I Am Legend\\" a welcome addition to the horror genre.
6305807086|5.0|What a great movie this is, and a more insane story you could not ask for.<BR>Malkovich is amazing and some of the sequences with him are trippy and surreal but deeply funny.<BR>Its difficult to know where to start in runnning through the good points, but theres certainly no bad points, and in such an ambitious project that says a lot about the strength of direction.<BR>Cusacks best performance, its a shme he doesnt do less mainstream stories more often, as here he displays a very different side to his acting.<BR>The cameos are exccelent, and Charlie Sheen is hilarious in his tongue in cheek portrail of himself. The whole sideways look at fame and celebrity is excellent.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt has been around long enough that they can take the liberty to experiment. This album is a definite success!! They added more fast-paced, upbeat songs without taking away any of their original songs. They also developed a cool, new Jamaican vibe for this CD. <br />The lyrics are honest and tell the story of their life, loves, and worries. Each song is different and you can listen to the whole album ten times over without skipping a single song. My personal faves are the obvious single, \\"Hey Baby\\", the fun \\"Making Out\\", the intriguing \\"Detective\\", and the rockin' steady \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\". I would go on and name every single song but I have a feeling that'd be pointless. <br />This CD is a breakthrough after the small disappointment in \\"Tragic Kingdom\\"'s follow-up, \\"Return of Saturn\\". It's an indication that this band has more to offer than a cool lead singer, they've grown up and moved beyond that. For the die-hard fan, no question. For the curious person who just stumbled across No Doubt, definitely give it a try. It won't be long before you're hooked!

It still hasn't left my CD player.  &quot;Complicated&quot;, though it is a great song, I have to admit could be mistaken for being written by many of the female artists out there.  But Avril's CD as a whole is unmistakeably her own.  Reading some of the other reviews on this page, I will warn you that this album is not hard core punk.  But who ever said it had to be?  She's a lot more punk than I am, so I can't complain!!  It's rock with a new twist and a pinch of pop flavour, and the lyrics are all about the honest life of a seventeen-year-old, with subjects we can all relate to (or could have at that age, depending how old you are).<br />A quick review of each song: (out of 10)<br />Losing Grip: a good, solid rock opener - 8<br />Complicated: the smash single - 9<br />Sk8er Boi: fast-paced and in-your-face - 10<br />I'm With You: painfully sweet and confused - 9<br />Mobile: fun metaphor -8.5<br />Unwanted: hard music - 7.5<br />Tomorrow: slow and semi-optimistic, good singing - 9<br />Anything but Ordinary: teenage girl - 8.5<br />Things I'll Never Say: sweet to hear, great to sing to - 9.5<br />My World: Love it!! fast, great beat - 10<br />Nobody's Fool: different, some almost-rap that's weird at first but grows on you - 9.5<br />Too Much to Ask: strong in flavour - 9<br />Naked: naked. good way to end the CD - 8<br />As you can see, I have no complaints, and I love every single song.  I could give them all tens or nine-point-fives but Idid it this way for sake of comparison.  This is a great debut album, and I suggest those unhappy people to get off Avril's back and listen to what this music is really about.  She can sing, write her own songs, play guitar, looks good, and she's nobody's fool.  Overall, the CD is a great lifter and I think any one who likes any sort of music will be surprised - now this is good music! I love it, I bought it, so shouldyou.
B00005LB50|4.0|Sure the box set is great and sure there is room for the aforementioned criticism. That said, does anyone know where to get versions of Neil singing (rather than Richie) the Neil songs: &quot;On The Way Home&quot;, &quot;...Clancy...&quot;, &amp; &quot;Do I  Have To Come Right Out and Say It?&quot;? I'm kind of surprised such is not in this box set and wonder if they exist. Are they being saved for Neil's own box set?
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is by far one of the best industrial/rock albums ever recorded(the other being The Downward Spiral)and you can definitley tell Trent Reznor(of Nine Inch Nails)had a hand in creating it! This is alot better than Holy Wood, almost every track is excellent you can honestly go through this entire album without skipping a single track! This is a gem of an album and I hope Manson's next(The Golden Age of Groutesque)is just as good as this! Alot of people create a controversy over Manson's lyrics but there are people who are in favor of religion and those who are not and there are people who sing about religion and those who sing against it. Anyway it's not like anyone is shoving this album down your throat you have the choice to listen to it or listen to whatever you want to! I reccomend you listen to this album if you have an open mind, are not offended easily, and you like hard rock.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone the movie was really bad compared to the book.  But assuming that you haven't read the book this movie is really injoyable, not worth owning though.  The special features on the other hand are really fun, you get to explore hogwarts in a 3-D journey as you collect items to open new levels, you can play games and meet the characters in the movie. The 4 stars refers to the dvd, the movie, however, only deserves 3.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is an excellent movie(usually classified as a &quot;guy&quot; movie)that can possibly open up your mind to what previously might have been invisible to you. Brad Pitt is excellent in it and so is Ed Norton, I did not like Helena Carter in this. Its definitley a revolutionary type movie and I thought David Fincher did an excellent job directing it(as always)and I reccomend anyone watch it that likes action in their movies and like watching movies w/a message!
B00006CXSS|5.0|It is not often that a film which focuses on historical authenticity can be so gripping, emotional and telling.  Band of Brothers is the story of E company, 506th PIR, 101st Airborne Division.  It begins with their training in 1942 and continues until the end of the war.  <br />Finally a movie has been produced which pays tribute to the men and women who lived through this great and terrible time.  \\"Hollywood\\" is kept to a minimum, historical authenticity is as high as it can be while still capturing the interest and attention general population - which is a lot to be said, considering the mini-series runs 10 hours long.<br />Band of Brothers has the visual realism of Saving Private Ryan, with the historical accuracies of A Bridge Too Far.  <br />Finally, a QUALITY film about the men who fought in WWII!<br />Sincere thanks to all the vets out there who sacrificed their lives (physical and emotional) so we could be sitting here, freely going about our lives.
B000021YQV|5.0|SOAD are one talented band definitley look out for these guys they are gonna go far in the metal industry! This is an excellent album and it rocks and is pretty good at producing mellow music also! Anyway I would describe the band as a cross between Slipknot and Nirvana, but that is just me. This album is not perfect(perfect being every track is good)but it is close. I reccomend you check out this album if you like intelligent hard rock.
0307120007|5.0|With an activity on every page, this book is a winner. Children can pet the bunny, feel daddy's beard or lift a blanet for peek a boo with baby. The pictures are gentle made with simple lines. The simple line pictures make it easy for young eyes to focus to see the picture. The activities are fun and focus on touching. This is a classic that I grew up with and my children are growing up with now.<br />Enjoy.
B000067JHW|5.0|This is a wonderful, sparkling gem of a movie, with many facets.<BR>It is a realistic slice of Parisian life, with scenes in empty subway stations, apartment rooms,bistros,  courtyards and parks. It is a quirky romantic tale of a woman getting to know herself and finding her soul mate. It is also a montage of vignettes about people in Amelie's everyday world. These characters are portrayed so well that one finds themself drawn not only to Amelie, but  to these others as well. We care about what happens to them all. Finally, and most uniquely, this movie reflects a deep truth. Amelie decides to slowly change her world, by  performing little acts of kindness for those people around her. These impish, amusing  plots of tenderness are well thought out, and do impact other lives. The viewer seems to hover over these minute events, and then witnesses with  cosmic eyesight, how something much grander unfolds. It is a rare movie which entertains and edifies. &quot;Amelie&quot; is such a movie.
B000066I6N|4.0|It seems like everyone is having a crack at this covers-album business these days. Everyone for Bryan Ferry to Mark Lanegan is dusting off the old songbooks. This time your favourite lemon-squeezer from Led Zeppelin is giving it a whirl. The result is his most vital sounding collection in quite a while.<br />Freed of having to live up to the Zeppelin legacy - a millstone that dogged his recent underappreciated studio collaborations with Jimmy Page, Plant explores some of his favourite musical ground in a surprisingly tight set composed mostly of covers running the gamut from folkies like Bob Dylan (\\"One More Cup of Coffee\\") and Tim Buckley (\\"Song to the Siren\\") to forgotten psychedelic stylists like Moby Grape (\\"Skip's Song\\"). <br />Especially brave is his attempt at Billy Robert's \\"Hey Joe\\" - the definitive version of which remains the one Jimi Hendrix recorded for his first album. Plant does the song justice in his own way but all the credit shouldn't go to him alone as he is backed by as good a band as any - in fact better -- than have graced many of his previous solo efforts. Former Cure guitarist Porl Thompson does an impressive turn as a Jimmy Page style foil to Plant, going as far as providing some tasty bottleneck guitar runs on the country blues workout \\"Red Dress.\\" Meanwhile, Justin Adams adds eastern instruments - namely Darbouka and Gimbri -- to the mix of delicate string arrangements and spooky sounding organ. Other highlights include the album-opener \\"Feel Like I'm Fixing to Die\\" and the mournful folk-standard \\"Morning Dew.\\"<br />Fans of Zeppelin would be well served in picking this one up. Parts of this album have some reviewers comparing it to the folky, laid back, and earnest Led Zeppelin III. Much of Dreamland's brooding tone and spare arrangements remind me more of Presence, a darker, lesser-known collection from the Zep canon. At any rate, it's reassuring to see an old master successfully honing his craft without resorting to self-caricature.
B00003CXXP|1.0|The movie never ends. I saw this movie in the theater, and I want my money back. After about 3 hours of boring nothingness, I finally walked out. I had a very hard time staying awake through this movie. Speilberg just didn't know when to end it! There were so many parts when I thought the movie should have been over, because nothing was happening, but no. It went on and on and on.
B00005OM4N|4.0|\\"Britney\\" by Britney Spears is her best album yet, It's better than \\"...Baby One More Time\\" or \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" This album has a more mature sound..<BR>\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\"- first single and good song to dance to<BR>\\"Overprotected\\"- the begining is sort of weird but the song is alright, having some r&b influenced beat<BR>\\"Lonely\\"-The song is good, especially the chorus that is back-up by  a bass. Should be a single<BR>\\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\"-It's a good ballad a classic, but should've been longer.<BR>\\"Boys\\"-Another song to hit the dancefloor, this song makes you dance. It's better than the CO-ED remix.<BR>\\"Anticipating\\"-This song sounds sort of 60's style, it's alright, GOOD VOCALS!<BR>\\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll\\"- A cover of an old rock 'n' roll song, the cover of the song is good, except the \\"Is This thing on?\\" part.<BR>Cinderella- A good upbeat song with some good vocals<BR>\\"Let Me Be\\"- My favorite song on the whole album, this song is great, being written by Britney is good, the song has some great lyrics with some cool beats and sounds, I wish it was a little longer though.<BR>\\"Bombastic Love\\"-besides the misspelling of \\"boombastic\\" the song is alright, is sort of sounds like Pink's \\"Most Girls\\"<BR>\\"That's Where You Take Me\\"-great song, except the \\"la-la-la-la\\" part, it could've been better.<BR>\\"What's It Like To Be Me\\"-great Britney song but Justin Timberlake's vocals kills the whole song.<br />This album is great and should be in anybody's CD collection.
B00000JRTX|2.0|I rented Four Weddings assuming it's reputation as the quintessential romantic comedy would guarantee I would enjoy it. I got out my pop corn and tissues, ready to be won over by Hugh and Andi...what an awful letdown.<br />I wanted to love this film, really I did, but it falls flat. The biggest problem is that I had no connection to Andi McDowell’s character at all, she comes off as cold and just mean. McDowell was great in &quot;Green Card&quot;, but comes across all wrong here. Perhaps she needed more screen time to develop her character. Hugh Grant's standard stuttering-shy-guy routine is tired and unappealing this time around (although it won my heart without fail in other flicks). <br />There are some interesting things happening with Grant's circle of eclectic friends, but all that is pushed aside to chronicle Grant and McDowell’s relationship...which consists of chance meetings followed by a customary romp under the covers. I can't fathom how Grant's character falls in love with a woman he speaks to for ten minutes all together. The chemistry is just not there, and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying.<br />Skip this movie, I wish I had!<br />When Harry Met Sally, Jerry McGuire, Circle of Friends, or Monsoon Wedding are excellent substitutes.
0609610570|4.0|This is one of the better books on business that has been published in recent times. The ideas are immediately implementable and the processes are clearly defined. This otherwise excellent book was unfortunately marred by typos (poor execution and review). <BR>A must-ready for all leaders and aspiring leaders in this new business world - justify your existence.
0780626478|5.0|I loved this movie! I was a huge Brenden Fraser fan after seeing him in The Mummy and the Mummy Returns, so I rented this movie and fell in love with it. Brenden Fraser's character is almost the perfect guy, he can't sing, but he can definitely dance! The movie was done very well and has a lot of funny parts. Although, the first time I saw it I thought Alicia's character wasn't good enought for Brenden's I decided on the second viewing that they were perfect for eachother. A smashing movie!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm also going to have to disagree with Ricky Wright on this one. I wasn't a huge fan of the first single release from John Mayer, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, but the CD is phenomenal. It is a wonderful total-listen; you don't want to skip any of the tracks. It's also a fantastic makeout CD. <br />He does remind me of DMB a little, but as a huge DMB fan, there are definite differences between the two.<br />Since I haven't seen anyone else comment on it, I'll make a plug for Track 12, &quot;Not Myself&quot;. It, like most of the album, is very moving if you listen to the lyrics.<br />Nice job John - can't wait for the next one.
0131103628|5.0|This book is probably the thinnest book on C I have seen, and at first I wondered if it was worth the steep price. It is! Before I bought this book I had tried to learn C from a number of &quot;beginner&quot; books, and always got lost and frustrated (my only previous language experience had been BASIC). <br />This book (by the authors of C) was a great tutorial, leading me step-by-step through the features of C. This book uses very little technical jargon, instead talking about every feature in English, so it is easy to understand for someone with little experience. Also, all code examples in the book were thoroughly tested, so they work. (many books, including the ubiquitous Deitel &amp; Deitel books contain numerous errors that can be extremely frustrating to beginners)<br />Now that I know the language, I still use this book quite a bit. It is one of those rare books that is both a tutorial and a reference book. If I ever wonder about something subtle, or want to teach myself some advance topic, I can easily find the information in the well-organized index.<br />This book is a must buy and is probably the only book necessary to learn or use C. (although an algorithms book is a good companion).
0671027344|5.0|a friend of mine let me borrow this book not to long ago and i loved it. this book is a wonderful look into a young teenagers life as he searchs to find meaning of it.
B0000024R8|4.0|First, hats off to Mike London's review on 9/24/01. In it, Mr. London discusses Dylan's most recent album, \\"Love & Theft,\\" and solidly roots that disc's complexity, depth and power to the traditional songs that Dylan had absorbed and performs on his 1962 debut. The locus of all that the protean cultural force of the creature we call \\"Bob Dylan\\" is not only first personified here, on his debut album, but allows us a window into the methodology that this young artist would employ toward creating and perfecting some of the most compelling art of the 20th (and now 21st) centruy.<br />One of the most fascinating aspects of this album is Dylan's active participation in the creation of his own mythic figure. Whoever Robert Zimmerman was, this creation of his, this \\"Bob Dylan,\\" was borrowed, at least in patchwork, if not in whole quilt from Woody Guthrie, as well as Leadbelly, Charlie Patton, and an endless host of traditional rural American singers and songwriters.<br />This, of course, begs the question of Dylan's authenticity - but of course, Bob Dylan could not be an authentic, not in the sense that Woody Guthrie or Robert Johnson had been natural products of their time and environment. Dylan was a product of the post-war America, a land of fast change and easy acquisition, a time of dying myths and ideals, a time when the corporate/advertising power structure of capitalism had reached its zenith. In this context, it was no longer even a possibility of being a naïve \\"subconscious intuitive structuralist\\" such as Elvis had been. To be real in America in 1962 was to be conscious - and to be conscious, one had to deal with artifice in one's art.<br />The question of Dylan's \\"authenticity\\" is actually a moot point. The folksinging scene in Greenwich Village did not define \\"authentic\\" as being of a rural background, as much as it did the commitment of faithfulness to reproducing it. Hence, it was irrelevant that one was not from Kentucky coal-mining country in order to singthe song of a miners' strike - the important thing is that the song be reproduced accurately, with a degree of reverence that actually cloaked these pieces in a museum-like façade.<br />This is what Bob Dylan did NOT do - rather, he absorbed his material and re-channelled it through the personal instrument of his own creation. Dylan's raspy, nasal howling was a revelation. (\\"You sound like a hillbilly - we want `folk singers.'\\") <br />In a sense, the creation of \\"Bob Dylan\\" by Robert Zimmerman was no more contrived than Samuel Clemens' invention of \\"Mark Twain.\\" The persona of this character was rooted in its creator's character, took its raw materials from authentic sources and funneled them through his \\"creation's\\" sensibility.<br />The problem with \\"Bob Dylan,\\" it would soon be revealed, is that this character was much more complex, carrying a greater amount of depth, contradictions and an unpredictability that could ever have been foreseen.<br />One thing is for certain - despite all the forms and approaches that Bob Dylan would take, their roots are all here - the deep roots of American rural songs. Dylan was an encyclopedist, and his appetite was relentless. It was, as with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in their own fields, this obsessive appropriation of existing tradition that lent him the power to create his own unique body of work.<br />All that being said, this is powerful and fun listening:<br />1. You're No Good. This raw, rootsy song features passionate, almost wild-man singing from Dylan.<BR>2. Talkin' New York. Dylan's first recorded original tells the story of his arrival in NYC, told in a traditional, Woody Guthrie-talking style. Dylan has already mastered comic asides with impeccable timing.<BR>3. In My Time of Dyin'. Shades of Charley Patton. Incredibly soulful Delta blues picking & spine-chilling vocals. The amazing thing is not how this young man emulates his predecessors, but seems to possess their spirit.<BR>4. Man of Constant Sorrow.A more conventional folk-style song. Long, strung-out harmonica lines. The voice is long and lonesome, a connection with many folk singers of the past. <BR>5. Fixin' to Die. The edge of desperation in Dylan's enunciation, his hold & release, his gutteral, perfectly-pitched screams express anguish with astonishing power.<BR>6. Pretty Peggy-O. This happy backwoods rant gets Dylan's fullest harmonica treatment. The excitement in his vocals is contagious, his whoops & hollers liberating. Once again, his enunciation of certain words and phrases gives the song new life and meaning at every turn.<BR>7. Highway 51. Raw open tuning and hard-core strumming turn this song into a hard-core barn burner. Dylan's vocals reach the apex of their intensity here.<BR>8. Gospel Plow. This fast-picking gospel rouser actually has the feeling and intensity of an old field recording.<BR>9. Baby, Let Me Follow You Down. A spoken introduction leads into a very tuneful, blues-inflected song that's part yearning, part despair and all joy.<BR>10.  House of the Rising Sun. A dark and traditional reading of this song of destiny, Dylan keeps the mood ominous. He holds back in his vocals until the fourth verse. <BR>11.  Freight Train Blues. The most outstanding feature may be Dylan's long-held note, emulating a train's whistle. A hard, fast number that seems about to explode.<BR>12.  Song to Woody. A song to his mentor, this original folk tune frankly acknowledges Dylan's roots, as well as his own limitations in relationship to the singers that came before him.<BR>13.  See That My Grave Is Kept Clean. Another open-tuning blues, desperate in the mold of \\"In My Time of Dyin'.\\" This young man's obsession with death shows a link to the past and an awareness of the self to the immediate infinite.<br />If you want to understand Bob Dylan, you simply must own this disc. (I do not recommend it as your first Dylan purchse - try \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" (1963) or \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" (1965) first.But soner or later, you'll have to come back to square one . . . Dylan did.
B00004X0ER|4.0|This album is jam packed full of raw energy.  If your looking for something thats better than bands like the strokes and the white stripes, then this is it.  It is incredibly fast paced and will leave you wanting more.  The album definitely is short, but well worth the money, by a long shot.  Has a lot of punkish sounding riffs and a great lead vocal effort.  Definitely the best rock I've heard in a while.  Go get it, or borrow someone else's, you have to hear this band.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This DVD is the best ever if your a Rammstein fan THIS IS FOR YOU!!!!!
0064407667|5.0|Once upon a time tale for and about children were dark and dreadful.  The stepmother in the end of snow white dances to her death in iron shoes heated over hot coals, the little mermaid dies, these are not happy stories.  These stories show that kids books don't always have to be light and happy, but explore the darker side of life.  Also, rarely has there been a writer who feels that maybe, just maybe, it might be nice to explain the meanings of words to young children, in a way that does not demean them, but will allow them to retain the information
0783225970|5.0|My husband and I have done research on the apartment complex where Tony and Hector exchanged a little more than words (a little blood and coke).  It's on South Beach in the legendary Ocean Drive and is presently a \\"Johnny Rockets.\\"  To this day, you'll still see the stairs leading up to the door where Manny blew the jalousies to smithereens.  Of course South Beach has improved much since the 1980's, thanks to the War on Drugs (and a little light and paint).  <br />On a side note, don't you just love Marta?  =)
0783114222|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This film is to the moon what Ken Burns did for the Civil War.<BR>I recommend that every person should watch this movie. I can not believe the number of famous actors who had a role in this picture. I would encourage people to read a book or 2 on the space program during the 1960's before watching this movie as it helps in giving familiarity to the characters and events. I admire HBO's presentation on Apollo 13. HBO presented this mission through the eyes of the reporters covering this story. In fact HBO demonstrates the changing of the guard in the reporting world, as reporters begin to disregard private lives at the expense of a good story. For anyone who wants to watch Apollo 13 from the astronauts point of view then watch the movie Apollo 13 (Tom Hanks).<BR>Enjoy this movie, it is one of a kind.
630512065X|4.0|If you've never seen Cats, you're missing a cultural experience. This musical is beyond the reach of those of us who are down-to-earth, real-world, biscuits-and-gravy folk.  It's artsy in style and content, and not the kind of thing your average redneck would enjoy, but despite their rural roots, my teenagers love this video.  They've watched it so much that they can sing all of the songs--even when they are not watching the video.<br />If I wanted to introduce kids to spectacular musicals, this would be the one I'd choose.  Frankly, watching strange poems set to music and dance is not my cup of tea, but the performances are first rate, the costumes are remarkable, and the theatre technicians did a super job. Check it out for the sheer entertainment value.  If you decide it &quot;means&quot; something, then you get something extra.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album is the Beatles in peak form, after their early beat/skiff style.  The Beatles demonstrate top-notch lyrics and every song could stand alone because each song is unique and this album has no filler at all.
0140288503|4.0|After reading &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; the first time, I was not overly impressed -- there was little context, little development of character or storyline, etc.  Then I realized that I was used to reading &quot;big texts&quot; on war, such as Keegan's analysis of World War I.  Dolt that I am, I was comparing apples and oranges.<br />On a second read, I appreciated &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; for what it is, an edge-of-your seat page-turner.  Mark Bowden brings the characters to life within the framework of a brief event, and I saw a much more human side to the story.  Sure, there's a lot of repetitive mowing down of Somalis, but that's what our men were forced to do by circumstance.  <br />The story of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; may seem trite in the abstract -- the good boys on the front line are let down by politicians back home -- but that's essentially what happened.  If anyone needs confirmation of the mess that represents our current African policy, read this book.  You could also read it if you are inspired by tales of true life heroism beyond your imaginings.
B00005QDW5|1.0|What's the point of buying this album when you can listen to all of these songs for free at pinkfloyd.com?
B00005M989|4.0|Though a more apt title for this album would have probably been\\"BIGGEST HITS\\", THE VERY BEST OF nonetheless is a solid single disc compilation for those who don't feel the need to search out Prince beyond his radio singles. That said, all the big ones are here, from the grossly overplayed('When Doves Cry'), overrated('..Doves'again,'Purple Rain'), and the should have been completely ignored(the god-awful 'Thieves In The Temple' and the equally not good 'Raspberry Beret'). Among the missing in action, both 'The Most Beautiful Girl In The World' and '7' should have be included. Overall, a decent, if slightly incomplete, look at one of the most influential artists of the eighties and nineties, though those wanting a more complete overview would be better served by the two disc HITS collection.
079073463X|5.0|Ladyhawke is a very satisfying movie about two lovers, ex- Captain of the Guard of Aquila, Entienne Nevarre and his lover Isabeau d'Anjou. The bishop, who lusts after Isabeau finds out that she and Nevarre love each other and have exchanged secret vows. The bishop places a curse on the two of him. By day, Nevarre is human and by night a wolf. Isabeau by day is a hawk, and human by night. They are both &quot;always together, eternally apart.&quot; <BR>The only way the curse can be broken is if they are both in the presence of the Bishop when there is either a night without a day or a day without a night.<BR>The music is superb, adding to the movie's greatness.<BR>Ladyhawke is, as my friend puts it, &quot;tragically beautiful, laced with the darkest of mysteries, and brought to a satisfying, thrilling climax.&quot;
0694003611|5.0|My daughter, Aurora, cannot go to bed without it. A must have in a child's collection!
B000009EAD|5.0|Great though this album is, I've gotta say I disagree with many of the other reviewers. Seems to me that this is the most beloved Iced Earth album, in general, whereas I personally think it to be the weakest of the 5 Barlow studio albums.(well, I guess &quot;Purgatory&quot; is a compilation really, not an album, but it's still better than this in my mind. Also, everyone should note that my opinion on what is better than anything else changes so frequently that it is essentially pointless for me to say it, but I will anyway.) Still, it rules, and anyone with any taste should like it.<br />Iced Earth's performances are solid, as always, though not quite as good as most of their other stuff. MacDonough bass is as overshadowed as ever, and not as good as Digiorgio(names probably wrong, sorry) from &quot;Horror Show&quot;, but he gets the job done. Schaffer provides a greater variety of riffs in this one, with fewer thrashy ones, and generally less aggressive sounding ones. Prator plays solid drums as well, with very good double bass, though he too isn't as good as Smedley or Christy, or the guy from &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot;, who's name I can't recall. Tarnowski is the real standout, with his leads on this album being the best of any Iced Earth album I've heard. Barlow's vocals aren't as strong as on his 3 previous albums either, though still some of the best you will ever hear. All this may sound kind of negative, but it really isn't meant to be. They just aren't quite as good as they usually are, which is still immeasurably better than most bands, and easily maintains their position in the trio of the very best bands.(the others are Metallica and Tool, if any one cares.)<br />Song wise, this album is bit less cohesive than their other albums, which can be good and bad.(In this case, it's somewhat bad.) In many ways this album is like Metallica's Load, (despite not sounding much like it) in that they are experimenting and expanding their sound after the album during which they removed most of their more progressive  tendencies. Thus they have a greater variety of song styles, but with less variety of sounds within the individual songs. So now have several ballads, some straight metal songs, some short thrashy stuff and one prog-epic. The problem is that they didn't expand the styles as much as the did the track listing(13 songs), so it is occasionally a bit repetitive. For example &quot;Melancholy&quot;, &quot;Watching Over Me&quot; and &quot;Blessed Are You&quot; are remarkably similar, moreso than any songs on any of their other albums, with &quot;Melancholy&quot; and &quot;Blessed Are You&quot; being the weakest(though still pretty good) Iced Earth songs I've heard. &quot;My Own Savior&quot; isn't particularly brilliant either. However, the rest of the album is very strong. &quot;Burning Times&quot; has great vocals, and some good rhythm work. &quot;Disciples of the Lie&quot; is their most aggressive song, extremely fast, with Barlow's most vicious vocals of all. &quot;Consequences&quot; is a great semi-progressive ballad, with a brilliant mid-section and some awesome soloing. &quot;My Own Savior&quot; is more pounding, speed-metal rage with lots of double bass, followed by the slower, moodier &quot;Reaping Stone&quot;, which has an awesome riff during the chorus. &quot;1776&quot; is a classic instrumental, with more great solos, and some lovely flute. The &quot;Something Wicked&quot; trilogy at the end is very good, though it suffers from it's vast inferiority to &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; and &quot;The Suffering Trilogy&quot; from the previous albums. Still, it's got some great moments, particularly the chorus from &quot;Birth of the Wicked&quot;.<br />In the end, this is definitely a 5 star album. Not being quite as good as the best material from one of the best bands ever isn't too much of a criticism. If you don't own any Iced Earth this is a pretty good starting point, despite being relatively weak, because it is moremelodic than most, as well as less dense and more immediate.melodic than most, as well as less dense and more immediate.
6304698623|5.0|This has got to be one of my favourite movies. I'm the type of person who loves orphan stories such as The Secret Garden, Annie, etc. But this one touched me like no other. It's about a little girl named Sarah who loves storytelling. She hasn't any brothers or sisters, nor a mother, so she just has one father whom she loves more than anyone. They both live together in India. Then her father is called to battle, and Sarah is sent to a boarding school in New York, where her mother used to attend as a girl. When her father is killed in battle and there's no one to pay for Sarah's school fees, the cruel headmistress forces Sarah into a life of poverty. She quickly befriends the other servant girl whose name is Becky, and somehow manages to live through the hardships that come her way. The ending just blew me away. The ending isn't the same as the book, because this movie is only based on the book, not a recreation. But all the same, you'll love it. The perfect family movie, and a great movie to introduce not only girls-but boys also-to the world of poverty children in England used to suffer.
0316666343|1.0|I don't understand what the fuss is about this novel. I expected so much more after reading this book's synopsis and reading all the rave reviews. I thought it had a lot of potential after reading the first few chapters of the book. But as I read on, I lost my enthusiasm.  I noticed that the characters are not very well developed, which is major factor as to how involved I get with a book.  I can read about the actions they take due to their grief.  But I don't FEEL their grief.  Also, several ideas are introduced, however, in the end they are only partially developed.  For example, the mother's actions are put aside at the end.  Then the last part of the book went on too long -- I had expected it to end much sooner because I didn't know what there could possibly be left to cover.  But I had read this far, I at least wanted to find out how it ended.  The ending was too sappy and happy-go-lucky for my taste.  Perhaps this book is better suited for teenage girls or those dealing with loss.  Great concept, poor execution.  Overall, I couldn't recommend this.
0385335482|5.0|I am not the shopping type person. Sophie Kinsella had ahold of my attention through the entire book. It was fun reading Becky's misadventures of her weakness for fashion.<br />It was great to read one of these single 20 something brit novels where the daughter actually has a pretty good relationship with her mother. It was refreshing.<br />All the of characters are well writen and mesh well with the story.
0316666343|4.0|I read this book in one night, I kept trying to go to sleep and my mind kept taking me back to it. I have already recommended it to friends, one of whom is currently reading it. I thought the writing was superb. The characters are multi demensional and there aren't any easy answers given. I appreciated that this devestating story didn't just rush from beginning to end, but followed the story for as many years as it took for the characters to begin dealing with their grief and lost dreams. <br />Excellant
B00005OAIE|3.0|Initially, all of the songs sounded the same; however, they began to grow on me after a couple more times through the CD.  It took me a while to hear the more subtle elements of John Mayer's chord progressions and arrangements.  His tasteful guitar work and smoky voice are carefully woven into each song to great effect.  The lyrics unfortunately border on trite sometimes, but they provide some hope for improvement in his next release.  <br />In the end, Room For Squares showcases Mayer's unique sound in a clean, breezy pop album that isn't meant to change the world.  <br />Songs to check out: Neon, Great Indoors, No Such Thing.
0071373586|4.0|A classic in marketing how-tos, the authors explain the importance of offering something for sale that appeals to the buyer, not to the seller, creator, or manufacturer. The product is positioned relative to the consumer, and her needs and viewpoints of value. The basic theory is that you get into the mind of your consumer, and position your product accordingly. And on that point, almost anyone would have to agree.<br />You will not find the gory details in this book that you'll need to execute a marketing plan, though, but the general theme is examined, as well as various positioning examples (everything from Kleenex to Heinz Ketchup - or was that pickles?).<br />I was particularly disappointed about a lack of methodology to reach a positioning statement, other than some fairly broad &quot;rules&quot;, lightly applied throughout the book. There were six questions at the end that were helpful, but did not constitute a rigorous method - well, any method really - to create a &quot;position&quot;. If anything, I would have wished for the method that could be used to create positioning for a product, or to test a company's current positioning, rather than have as many examples of positioning failures.<br />Some of the author's examples seemed contradictory, and especially when the authors claimed that brand extension amounts to a virtual see-saw - one product steals the brand identity from another (Heinz Ketchup vs. Heinz Pickles - who is Heinz!?). From hindsight, it can be seen that some brand extensions have been extremely successful, while others aren't. It should shock no one that people don't want to use baking soda as anti-perspirant, for instance, and therefore completely explaining why we use Arm &amp; Hammer to cook and deodorize the refrigerator, but do not think of it as a personal hygiene brand. I can't think of anything that I would remove from the refrigerator and rub under my arms.<br />In any case, this remains a quick, good read with short chapters. Theexamples illustrate the concepts, but you'll need to follow this up with other positioning and marketing examples in order to position your product within your industry.
0446608955|4.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, and I have to say, although the character development in the movie is not as good (for obvious reasons, you don't expect a 3 hour movie, right?) but I feel that the movie was more realistic as compared to the book. Overall, it's still an inspiring story, something I can relate to when I first fell in love (she's still alive though).
B00006F7XJ|5.0|So, after months of waiting and anticipation, I eagerly opened the Jiffy bag that had winged its way from sunny California. When the Camel web site had announced that the new album would be available, personally signed by Andrew Latimer, as a pre-order, I did not hesitate and duly waited for the goods. Imagine my frustration when I saw the CD in local record shops three days BEFORE  my pre-order arrived -  the suspense was agony! But patience is rewarded, they say, and boy is that true in this case.  <br />The opening (title) track starts with the sound of an old steam locomotive as childhood memories are evoked and the listener is pulled into dreamland.  In typical Camel style, the song passes through many changes of mood and builds in power.  Andy Latimer's awesome guitar playing is superbly supported by Guy LeBlanc's tasteful keyboards, Denis Clement's powerful drumming and Colin Bass's solid bass work. In fact the musicianship on this release proves this is one of the best Camel line-ups for years (can't wait for the live shows next year). A real bonus is that Andy has featured the flute more here than on any album since `Snowgoose' and the songs are all the better for it.  Once again, it's a collection that is rewarded with further listening and it wasn't until about fourth time through that I fully absorbed all of the subtleties within.  That said, the first song blew me away first time through.<br />`A Nod'  is sprinkled throughout with moods, imagery, and sympathetic sound effects, and the production is top notch, benefiting from crystal-clear high-definition CD encoding and some wonderful vocal close-micing techniques.<br />Proving that Camel don't take themselves too seriously is the delightfully humorous `Fox Hill' with some great Gabrielesque character voices playing the parts of a fox and its pursuing horse &amp; rider. It draws comparison with Nursery Crime-era Genesis but is completely original and has you grinning from ear to ear.  Other highlights are `A Boys Life' and the rousing instrumental `Squigley Fair'.<br />The album closes with the highly emotive `For Today'.  Evocative of Camel' s own `Ice' from `I Can See Your House From Here', it showcases Andy's fluid bluesy guitar lines and ably demonstrates why he's right up there on the podium (at the top, in my book) with the likes of Dave Gilmour. Read the sleeve notes and you will understand the special significance of this song and why (if you're a fan of the depth and emotion of Camel's music) it produces yet another `hairs on the back of the neck' moment.<br />It's easy to let the clichés fly but Latimer and co have produced an album that is majestic, powerful, emotive, humorous, whimsical, and in a class of its own within today's bland musical climate. It is only through their refusal to follow the corporate path and to retain total artistic independence that they have been able to produce something of this quality and in a style that is their's alone.  A Nod and a Wink is undoubtedly one of their finest.
6305807086|5.0|This movie has had its mixed reviews, those that enjoyed it pointing it to its quirkiness and to standout performances like Cusack's, those that hated it pointing to its pacing and what they call its pointlessness, but I think even if you look past all of those major ideas, you can find something valuable here.  If your taste doesn't match mine, you may not find it a 5 star movie, but it doesn't mean it's not enjoyable.  I'm a Spike Jonze fan and a Cusack fan (and now a fan of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman), so I checked it out, but had it not been for these preferences, I might have grabbed it anyway.  At times, finding something a little out of the ordinary is the key.  You want something that doesn't require you being completely braindead to enjoy, but you don't want something that's overly sappy or is basically a rewrite of thousands of other movies just like it.  Without speaking to some interesting concepts throughout the film or to specific techniques employed by Jonze/Kaufman, I find it easy to recommend this movie.  Ignore the reviews (including this one?) and just pick up a movie that challenges the typical Hollywood release.
B00005NI5Y|1.0|I thought time out of mind was the best album in 10 years.I have tried to  listen to this several times and I think it is terrible
0345347951|5.0|This is definitely Clarke's best work, and possibly my favorite sci-fi book ever.  Clarke has the ability to combine social commentary with amazingly realistic and prophetic scientific visions.  I could see a lot of his predictions coming true in the future (and some already have!).  I've read this book twice, and plan to read it more in the future.  Very dark, but strangely uplifting...
B00004TJFL|2.0|Halloween 5 is very ..., and the ending was extremely stupid.  The little girl, Jamie, was overall annoying and there is no Jamie Lee Curtis.  You don't see Michael's face either, and Donald Pleasence sounded like an old fart on his death bed.  Michael killed hardly any people, he just snuck around in their houses and watched 'em, he barely did anything.  Try H20 or the original Halloween, don't waste your money on this junk.
6303471730|1.0|This video was of very poor quality - looks like it has been dubbed over several times.
B000065V3H|2.0|I agree with all those who disaprove of the pan and scan DVD that has been released. I love this movie but will not buy it until it is available in widescreen.
B00005YW4H|5.0|listening to Ms. Jones' voice.  An outstanding album.  I do however agree that things get a little sleepy at times but she pulls it through.  Very impressive.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this CD! My friend told me to listen to one of his songs and I liked it so much i bought the CD and I've listened to it over and over. I found the lyrics to be absolutely poetic and though they may sound a little strange (&quot;make me a red cape, I wanna be superman...&quot;) they get his point across perfectly. Buy this!
B00003CX95|5.0|This is an amazing movie filled with action, romance, and dialog that really makes you think. If you watch movies to learn and their historical accuracy, don't watch it. But if you are someone who watches movies to be thrilled, moved and entertained, this is a must see.
B00005V9HA|2.0|I was expecting something totally different than this. All this film contains are talking heads a lot of crazy people yelling and some bad acting. I mean I wasn't expecting much from this in the first place, but still I was disappointed to even get less than I was expecting. I wish that only the good films would get the 2-disc treatment and not stupid cult films that I could have made in my basement. I can't wait to see what the sequels have in store for me, I guess you'll be seeing another review from me on those too (Hint: probably not a positive one). If you liked this then see the Howling movies, you'll be happy.
B000003BEM|5.0|After years of playing &quot;cat and mouse&quot; with the Beatles, and being joustled around by management filled with a room full of con and &quot;yes&quot; men, these English guys got together and decided what they liked and what rocked them ;turning their noses to conformity and possibly jumping on the next band-wagon, to churn out a great album filled with metaphors and nuiances that would transform and shape two or more generations of rockers like &quot;Guns' and Roses&quot;, kid rock, and Aerosmith.  I mean if you don't buy this, you are definately unaware. I've been listening to this for 25 years, and I'm almost feeling guilty because I still love it.  Although I don't advocate any references or topics they touch on, at this time the energy was in the air, and they tapped into it.  While all my friends listened to Metallica and Van Halen, I was listening to Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters because this album introduced me to the roots of the blues and not a photo copy of a photo copy.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|I have always enjoyed Jerry Bruckheimer &amp; Michael Bay films, not entirely because of their story lines but their all in good fun. Now they have made Pearl Harbor, a movie not intended to be fun but it is an action movie after all. <br />I personally thought 75% of the movie was good before. Now after seeing the new Director's Cut, I enjoyed pretty much the entire film. Yes the acting could have been a bit better and the story a bit more developped but what can you do? The Director's Cut is only one minute longer than the original, but still, some footage was replaced, some taken out and some new things were added. If you're not a fan of gore you may want to beware of some of the new shots contained in the new action sequence. It's not a substantial amount of blood &amp; guts that may make you cringe, but more of a realistic way of showing what happened. Also, the &quot;Love story&quot; seems to be a bit better paced with little cuts here and there to still keep your eyes on the screen.<br />Even if you did not enjoy the movie, you can learn a lot from this release about the real event and the filmmaking aspect. A lot of work went into this picture and most of it is shown here among its 4 discs! This is so far the best special edition ever released in my opinion in more ways than one. <br />This is a must own for any DVD collector, Pearl Harbor fan, or any aspiring filmmaker. I stronly recommend this Director's Cut.
B000002JS6|5.0|BACK IN BLACK must have some quality, I´d say that to those who eventually criticize this album. It is the sixth album more sold in the USA in all times, and it was made by a band who never sold out, mainly at that time (1980).<BR>It was the firs album with Brian Johnson in the band. A high toll to pay, debuting with such a strong album: it simply was not posible to follow it afterwards...<br />BACK IN BLACK is rock at its best. Let´s not define  styles here. It´s just ROCK, pulsating, alienating, energetic, magic rock. Even the famous bad and cheap lyrics by AC/DC are more controlled here and make some sense (afterwards, it would only decline, to the point where the Young Brothers would write them without Brian Johnson´s help....)<br />BRIAN JOHNSON / MALCOLM YOUNG / ANGUS YOUNG / CLIFF WILLIAMS / PHIL RUDD<br />They recorded rock history here.<br />Why and how the band never ever even came close to achieve
0312265859|2.0|..... that this kind of strained nonsense gets published. This is my first and last Evanovich novel and I gave it a 2 only because some of it is funny. But who reads mystery stories for comedy? Hard Eight has something to annoy everyone. The most tepid feminist will hate the incompetent female protagonist who is constantly being rescued by males drawn by her looks. Those looking for even a hint of gritty realism beneath the comedy will look in vain. The characters are cartoons. Men will grind their teeth in frustration at being set up for an ending that doesn't happen. This woman is in need of a editor. But hey, if it sells, plot and character are just incidentals.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the best movies, animated or not. This film, along with \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\", prove to you that animation can be just as good as any other movie. I was so (angry) to see how the academy treated the genre like ..., giving a new award. it brings shame to animators to see that they can't be in the same standards as others. Oh well, who gives a damn about the academy anyway?<br />On to the film... this special edition DVD is great! I recommend it over the other DVD release. The dub is pretty good, too. It's 5000 times better than the ... DBZ dub, and most of the japanese words are pronounced correctly, too. The production stills, while not providing much to the average viewer, are great for aspiring animators like myself. And it's one of the best sci-fi concepts ever made.<br />The movie's great. Check out the manga, too. You'll see a lot of differences in events and even in the characters.

It appears to be jammed!&quot;<BR>&quot;Rasberry...Only, one man alive would dare give me the rasberry!<BR>Lonestar!&quot;<br /> This movie is downright hilarious. The best spoof on Star Wars you will ever see. Movie buffs will really like this one, because it has little jokes at everyone, but mainly Star Wars. The cast in hilarious, espically Rick Moranis as &quot;Darth Helmet.&quot;<br />Go rent it. Run, don't walk, to Blockbuster and go get it. Watch. Write a review. You will laugh.
B00003CXBK|5.0|<for those of you who saw the original review, erase it from your heads. it had too much of that \\"Parental advisory\\" crack><br />This should have gotten nominated for Best Picture, but you know how society has prejudice against animated films, they think they can't fit in. Well, for those of you that are one of those people, when you see this film, you'll nail yourself for ever thinking that.<br />Oh well. Nail the prejudice. See this film. To hell with the academy.<br />It's a good fantasy movie. It's as good of a fantasy anime as Akira is for a sci-fi anime. While it can get really gruesome, Hayao Miyazaki, as always, puts some of the stuff he always did with his other films, like \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\", and the upcoming \\"Spirited Away.\\"<br />Oh yeah, if you think this movie's sick, check Akira out. That should be a huge kick in the face.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Okay this story has a lot of weird things going on (which is good). Experiments, motorcycles, spiritual energy, and super powers. This film is really great, I enjoy watching it every time. The animation is top notch, you can see lots of detail. And the (crazy) action is amazing, that many films copy and take from. This is a story of friendship, its also about abusing power. All I can say is you have got to see this. One of the greatest anime films and science fiction films out there. Can we really take our evolution into our own hands?? 5 stars! Check it out! Now! <br />PS. That review was just based on the film! This DVD has tons of extras that lend great insight to this epic tale. This DVD is a must have, very much worth your money.
B00005NGAL|5.0|I had the extreme pleasure of seeing CATS on Broadway three times.  I was sad to see it go.  Now with the DVD, I can watch it again and again and again and again.  And this time I don't have to pay $90 bucks for a seat!  Bravo!
B0000640VO|5.0|I lived in France last year and I was able to see this movie about 10 times. It's storyline is so good and realistic that everyone should see it. The story about Amelie deals with realistic fears and depicts the real essence of the French culture. The DVD is really good and I'm glad that it wasn't totally dubbed into english (otherwise it would have lost it's original interest). I could buy it with spanish and english subtitles to share this touching story with all my friends and family! A shouldn't miss...
B000069KE0|4.0|This album brings back a lot of memories.  My memories didn't include a compressed soundstage and anemic high-end, though, so I pulled out the old vinyl to compare.  The sound of the LP is just as compressed and dull as this CD release (and the Chicago Records single-CD release of a few years back).  My guess is that a better sounding master either doesn't exist or hasn't been located yet.<br />Otherwise, it's a great album, and we shouldn't expect that every recording made 30+ years ago can be spruced up to sound like it was recorded last week.
B00005YUNY|1.0|I eagerly bought this DVD as a souvenir, having seen last year's Symphonic Tour. Yes, the sound is good, but the video editing is what I call &quot;MTV-style attention deficit.&quot; Most shots last only 5 to 10 seconds before the camera angle is changed. This goes on for the ENTIRE CONCERT! Some of the shots are as short as 1 second. Even the documentary, &quot;Dreamtime&quot; suffers from the same dizzying cut &amp; paste editing. OK as a souvenir, but not something I can watch repeatedly (or even twice).
B00003CXA6|5.0|For all it's worth this movie at least makes people want to study the civil war and perhaps gets them out to Gettysburg to learn how the battle really occured.<br />Even though the beards were at times badly done and the acting was over dramatic, this film will give you a good basic knowledge of what occured in July of 1863
B000002U6E|5.0|Even though Enigma first made a name for itself with its single \\"Sadness Pt.1\\" off its debut album \\"MCMXC A.D.\\", it was the release of its sophomore effort, \\"Cross of Changes\\", that really established it as a major force in new age (and popular) music.  The hit single, \\"Return to Innocence\\", is such a haunting and captivating song that it still finds radio play on regular rock/pop stations almost 10 years after its release.  The tribal beats mixed with modern music and combined with an evocative choral solo power this simple song about realizing what's important in life (i.e. 'returning to innocence').  It still sends chills up my spine whenever it is played.  The two bookend tracks to \\"Return...\\" have also found a wide distribution, although, not as radio singles, but as frequently used scores movie trailers.  Track #2, \\"The Eyes of Truth\\" is frequently used in action film trailers, most notably for \\"The Matrix\\" (though, it did not appear on the soundtrack).  Track #4, the chilling \\"I Love You ... I'll Kill You\\" has found play on such movie previews as Arnold Schwarzenneger's \\"Eraser\\".  \\"The Eyes of Truth\\" is an amazing track as it plays slow, thumping beats before finishing with a flourish of a soaring chorus followed by a haunting female solo.  There is one other truly standout track on \\"Cross of Changes\\"... \\"The Dream of The Dolphin\\".  It evokes sense of spiritual peace with nature and is quite relaxing to listen to.<BR><BR>The beauty of this album is that, even with the separate standout songs, it flows together as one complete journey with each song feeding seamlessly into the next.  \\"Cross of Changes\\" provides a memorable musical adventure for the listener and foreshadows the greatness to come on subsequent albums \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\" and \\"Screen Behind the Mirror\\".
B000066NW0|5.0|Regardless of what people think, Avril Lavigne is NOT Britney Spears. They don't sound even similar. For instance, take a look at Avril's video for 'Complicated' and Britney's for 'Slave'...Instead of some orgy mess mixed in with dancing, Avril's video is so...down to earth. She plays her own instruments, and writes her own songs. She doesn't always try and sing about love and boys, as if she has experienced the world at seventeen. However, she has had some experiences, and writes about them. Breakups, to being a young star, there are diverse songs. Enough about that now. Just wanted to clear it up.<br />I first became familiar with Avril because my friend knows her guitar player. I met her, actually, and didn't think anything of it. When I heard the song on the radio, I loved it. I asked a guy at the local music store who it was. He said 'Avril Lavigne, of course!' I flipped! This was amazing. And, since she was a newcomer, her CD was only ($$$). So I picked it up. I'm glad that I did.<br />Rock songs to very slow songs, Avril proves herself to be anything but a teeny-bopper. She sings with heart, and she has a great voice. Her lyrics are deep, especially for someone her age. Unlike Britney, she can sing. My favorites are 'Anything But Ordinary', 'Mobile', 'I'm With You', 'Tomorrow' and 'Naked'. Yes, 'Complicated' is great, but very overplayed, as you probably know. Go pick up this great CD...
B00003CX5P|1.0|and a huge ego, backed by millions of people telling you how amazing you are, and you get The Phantom Menace, one of the worst films ever put onto celluloid. Everything about this movie is pure garbage, from the 3rd grade reading-level script, the ludicrous plot lines, flat cardboard characters, everything. Phantom Menace isn't about not living up to the hype, it's about being pure cinematic tripe. Hmmm, Lord of the Rings certainly had a lot of hype behind it, and Peter Jackson is a real director, who can actually make real movies. George Lucas has spent the last 25 years hiding from the fact he is incapable of recreating Star Wars, and now he finally believes the hype, that he has some talent. What a shame. <br />Here's an idea, hire REAL directors with skill and talent to direct your big-budget movies. It worked in ESB, why not here. Oh that's right, Mr. Lucas' ego!<br />Don't waste your money on the DVD version of this, want something pretty to look at with zero substance, look at a fashion magazine. You'll get more out of it.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This film is wonderful. From its heartfelt depiction of both past and future to its depth of characterization, it hits the mark again and again. Its protagonist, Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce), is portrayed as a likable, genuine genius (right down to his Einsteinian longer hairstyle) with equally genuine motivations for his actions. After tragedy strikes he becomes a haunted man, driven to discover why the laws of temporal physics prevent him from attaining the goal he so desperately seeks -- and the limitation imposed upon him is one his brilliant mind quickly recognizes, even with a minimum of evidence.  <br /> Every other character in the story is equally well presented. 'Vox' (Orlando Jones) is a delight whenever he appears on-screen, as is Jeremy Irons' rational, almost vampiric villain of the distant future. Samantha Mumba's portrayal of the Eloi woman who befriends Hartdegen is both believable and suitably subtle. <br /> The film's musical score is magnificent, as are its visual effects, which provide a feast for the eyes. Some scenes are simply breathtaking. Both sight and sound are believable and clever, right down to the most subtle touches. The machine itself is astounding, a marvel of brass, glass and wood -- the most complex prop ever built, it was genuinely fashioned out of those materials from which it appears to have been constructed (no fiberglass or other Hollywood structural trickery here!) and when complete weighed some 4000 pounds. It's almost as impressive a sight sitting still as when fully active. <br /> This film suffers only when unfairly compared with its Pal-directed predecessor, a familiar and comfortable classic many have grown to love, despite its faults (and a film to which this version gives many loving nods). When looked upon with fresh eyes, this new telling of 'The Time Machine' stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the earlier work and is a worthy contribution to the legacy of H.G. Wells' original story. Not surprising, since its director is Wells' own great-grandson, Simon. <br /> A great movie, and a great DVD with many enjoyable extras. Highly recommended!

B000021Y77|5.0|One story with three different endings almost as bizarre as the next with a pulse racing soundtrack. Franka Potente gives a riveting performance and her screams can shatter glass. One of Europe's more brillian entrees from director Tom Twyker. Strangely, the soundtrack and the movie as just inseparable. Without the music, it would be just a good movie. With it, it is defying imagination. A must see. After you see her in the Bourne Identity, you'll want to see why Matt Damon refused the role unless Franka Potente got the part. You might have been a little disappointed in the Bourne Identity's near lack of believeable story, but you won't be in Run Lola Run. ...And, she did it way better than Forest. :) -Felecia Constance Rowe, Chairwoman, Felecia Constance Rowe, Inc.

By this, I'm referring mostly to the technical aspects, some of which are still impressive, but the battle scenes lack the gruesome authenticity of more recent war pictures such as Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers, and what graphic violence the movie does present isn't terribly convincing.  Worse yet, the skirmishes that are presented are very unconvincingly acted, and as a consequence, much of the death scenes are more melodramatic than realistic (the part where the old lady is shot is unintentionally amusing, and not the slightest bit horrific).<br />The problems go far beyond the action sequences.  As most know, the film features a huge cast of stars, including Sean Connery, the excellent Anthony Hopkins (the best actor of this cast), Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Michael Caine, James Caan, and a lot more people than I'd care to waste space mentioning.  Just about everyone here, with the possible exception of Hackman, is slumming, obviously just there to pick up paychecks and get their screen time over with.  Almost no here makes an impression.  They're just on-screen to inform us of the dire situation and occasionally wield a gun and fire it.<br />Worst of all is that Operation Market Garden was a massive event, but the film fails to capture just how epic the invasion was.  The battles we witness are small in scale, very disappointing when you consider how many extras were involved in the production.<br />The musical score is horrendous; most of the time its composition consists of a distracting, upbeat tune that doesn't gel with the material it corresponds with.  Thus, moments that should be generating suspense almost elicit laughter, since the score almost seems to be inviting parody.<br />Sure, I realize this was the late 70's and all, but Apocalypse Now, made just two years later, was a much more convincing and effective anti-war film, andit wasn't even an accurate depiction of the Vietnam War!  True, A Bridge Too Far strives for accuracty, but such an attempt amounts to little if you can't make the audience care.
0380820846|5.0|I have to disagree with the reviewers that said this was a disappointment.  This story was unique in that Penelope wasn't a raving beauty, she was a spinster and had never been courted by a man before Colin came along.  And Colin hadn't been very impressed with her years back.  He was the catch of the ton and considering her circumstances, he shouldn't have given her a second glance.  But he did.  And that's what makes it such a beautiful love story.  Everything he does and says to her will make you fall in love with him.  He was the perfect hero for her and their story was one of my favorites.  I've read every Julia Quinn book and they were all good.  This one, however, is one of my favorites.  But don't start it unless you have lots of time because you won't want to put it down.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album reminds me of late nights at greasy bars finishing off my last beer and talking heavy-headed to my friends about why we didn't hook up that night.  Those are some of my favorite times, so this is one of my favorite albums.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|So John Forbes Nash is now (almost) a household name. With good reason... the Nobel prize mathematician's story is a good one. It deserves attention... and director Ron Howard did a wonderful job of creating a masterful piece of Hollywood cinema. Based on Nash's experiences at New Jersey's most famed learning establishment, Princeton University, thru the development of his economic theory (\\"Nash's Equilibrium\\"), his marriage to Alicia, and his eventual work at MIT. Imagine if Robert Redford directed and Tom Cruise played the part of Nash as it might have been (they both considered it). I can't see this film being much better... however it would be kind of interesting to see another great director's (and the actor's) take on the same script. Russell Crowe takes the challenge of portraying the man with a chip on both soldiers (in this case schizophrenia), Mr. John Nash, right in stride with his previous preformance as Maximus in \\"Gladiator\\". I can't imagine anyone else playing this role of Nash as well as Crowe did. Co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Judd Hirsch round out a wonderful supporting cast. Footnote: Alicia (Connelly) was maybe to evenly tempered in this film thru all of Nash's emotional ups & downs... almost too much so (a performance worthy of an Academy Award... I'm still sitting on the fence about it... it was good, but it wasn't brilliant). Beautifully filmed - partly on location (Princeton Univ, NJ). This is how drama should be. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" will make you think - Is he imagining all this? Yes he is... no he isn't, yes, no, not sure, those people in the shed behind their house ARE real, no they aren't... yes - he is delusional. DVD features include commentary by Ron Howard, deleted scenes with Howard's commentary, meeting John Nash, special effects featurette, and more. Oscar winner for best picture, best director for Howard, best supporting actress for Connelly, and best adapted screenplay. Ron Howard's movies just seem to get better and better... sheriff Andy Taylor must be proud of his favorite TV son.ovies just seem to get better and better... sheriff Andy Taylor must be proud of his favorite TV son.
B000007U6V|5.0|Out of Kraftwerk's amazing discography, two albums stand out as my favorites by far.  One is Radio-activity, and the other is Autobahn.  But if you had to only hear one Kraftwerk album, I'd probably recommend this one.  The reason is that this album catches the band at a perfect moment.  After the mucking around of their very odd first albums, they finally stumbled upon something new and brilliant.  Somehow, a sound was created on this album that you just can't find anywhere else, and from start to finish you can feel the band's absolute joy that from here, anything was possible.  <br />     Enough has been said about the epic title track, you already know it's Kraftwerk's masterpiece.  But the more experimental second side of the album is not to be overlooked.  Kometenmelodie 1 goes on a bit long, but it's got a sense of wonder that explodes into a celebration in Kometenmelodie 2, which is one of those insipidly cheerful songs that you can't help but smile through, and love every minute of.  Mitternacht is an unsettling atmospheric track, that paints a picture of a jungle, or the middle of the woods just as the lights go out, and the random noises are scaring the pants off of you.  The album closes with Morgenspazergang, which uses simple synthesizer effects to create a bubbling brook, and birds chirping (which is really cool, and you kind of have to hear it to understand) as a simple flute and dulcimer melody lulls you off to sleep.<br />     No, Autobahn isn't a perfect album, and it's a bit rough around the edges compared to Man Machine or Trans Europe Express.  But it and Radio-activity sound so much warmer and more human than the albums that followed (the presence of flutes and guitars added to this effect on Autobahn).  Any music lover will want to hear this, simply because there's nothing else like it.  It's a joyous experiment, as if the band just discovered a new toy and wanted to find every possible way to play with it in 40 short minutes.  Autobahn is Kraftwerk's happiest album to date, and it also happens to be brilliant.
B000067CPX|4.0|When you think of the peppers you think of those good mellow, funky, rocky songs. \\"By the way\\" is much softer than their previous albums, but it doesn't make it worse by my opinion. Songs like \\"I could die for you\\" and \\"Universally speaking\\" are great to listen to if you pay some good attention to Flea's and John's harmonicall teamwork.<br />Although it's not what we are used to hear of the peppers but it's still the peppers. They are still Red Hot!
B000007T1M|5.0|I strongly feel this is better than toxicity. Although this doesn't have quite the range that you find on toxicity it has songs with much more energy, and lots more pace. <BR>And although the music may not be as 'mature', the lyrical content is still furious, gaining the band their activist reputation, examples being the opener and closer, the first (suit-pee) is a song about the problems of religion and is a great live song, the closer is P.L.U.C.K., which is a song about the Armenian Slaughter in the first half of the 20th century by the Ottoman Empire and later the Turkish state.<BR>Also, I don't agree with those who don't like track 9, it is one of the best songs, it just takes some getting used to.<br />M
0316666343|5.0|After reading a write up of this book in Time magazine, I had to have it. I was not dissapointed. The details of the crime will choke you up, but are handled in a tasteful manner (considering the subject). It is interesting the way the author weaves in additional story lines that are equally good. You are literally sucked in emotionally. Waiting for answers along with the family, and somehow hoping that through your own imagination the story will take a particular course. I have never read a book in which the author was so creative. My only criticism of the book would be that I found myself having to backtrack a few times to figure out either who was speaking, or the time frame in which the action was happening. I have already begun passing around the book for other people to read, something I very rarely do. It is definately worth  reading.
0738206679|1.0|If you are interested in learning about the theory and methods of analyzing and understanding social networks this is not a good book. The author is new to the area of networks and although he is very enthusiastic he is just a network &quot;newbee&quot;and is very naive. This book is not about networks but about Barabasi's own work and the work of his friends. Barabasi does not discuss network analysis or the state of the art in network research. He is either unaware or fails to acknowledge volumes of research done on networks by mathematicians and social scientists. When he does pay lip service to this prior work his tone is condescending and his characterizations are just plain wrong. I am surprised that this self proclaimed World Wide Web guru was not innovative enough to click the option in Web of Sciences that would include in his searches citations from the social science citation index. I am of course giving him the benefit of the doubt here. If you are interested in another manifestation of a power law or in &quot;scale free networks&quot; this is your book. If you are serious about learning about network theory or doing network analysis this book is a waste of time.
B00005OWIU|3.0|Looking at what John Williams has already done in the realm of movie music, Harry Potter doesn't exactly measure up. The composer is famous for brilliant fanfares (\\"Star Wars\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"Indiana Jones\\") and memorable themes. He has even taken a gory horror movie, \\"Jaws,\\" given it a gimic (DUN-dun-DUN-dun-DUN-dun-DUN-dun) and done wonderful things with that single theme, unlike other horror movie scores (\\"Psycho\\", \\"Halloween\\") which are in my opinion pretty basic and repetitive.<br />\\"Harry Potter\\" just isn't a sound track you can listen to for major entertainment and get the songs stuck in your head. Even though the mystical themes of the movie suggest that the music shouldn't be songs, but rather \\"pieces,\\" which I think only a musician could enjoy, while everyone else says, \\"What? There was music in the background?\\"<br />The CD starts off with an eerie sort of \\"music-box\\" feeling, slightly reminiscent of late-90's Anastasia's \\"Once Upon a December.\\" The theme is repeated throughout the movie, though accompanied by a collection of unflatteringly experimental-sounding tunes. One thing I find wrong with the score is that there are too many songs. Star Wars mainly stuck to three or four, Superman to two or three, but you may as well watch the movie in this case, with a whopping 23 tracks!<br />There are some surges of excitement in the score, with choir participation, but they die down too quickly. These \\"surges\\" should be accompanied by a repetition of one of the themes, like in the \\"E.T.\\" Theme or Star Wars' \\"Duel of the Fates.\\"<br />Finally, the \\"Voldemort\\" theme is a little too reminiscent of Darth Vader's in chord stylings, and almost a replica of the \\"Emperor's Theme\\" from Star Wars in rhythm.<br />In most cases, the music moves the movie along, and causes a greater part of the movie's popularity. Titanic had \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\" The Grinch had \\"Mr. Grinch.\\" But Harry Potter eventually subsided in popularity to Lord of the Rings, and Lord of the Rings to Spiderman, and Spiderman (of course) to <BR>STAR WARS II.

B000063DI9|5.0|This album isnt so radically different from previous Iron Maiden efforts, but it did serve to alienate a number of fans, mainly due to the prominent use of keyboards suffusing many of the tracks.<br />However, as it transpired, this was an ambitious, well executed and ultimately triumphant step forward for Maiden.<br />The inclusion of keyboards was not the only alteration made to the typical Maiden formula. The band made many progressive changes to their sound and writing on this release, a commendable step in itself.<br />Surprisingly, 'Seventh son of a Seventh son' is a concept album, concerning the story of the young protagonist who discovers he possesses clairvoyant powers, and tells of how he is shunned by his fellow villagers when attempting to warn them of an impending disaster.<br />The story is told sparingly, intelligently and compellingly. Despite concerning a rather esoteric theme, the tale woven is surprisingly effective, perhaps due to the vast scope of its conscience despite the fairly narrow focus. The album deals with universal, intrinsically human themes, like love, seperation, death and despair, as well as the obligatory 'Evil That Men Do'.<br />Add to this the fact that the band sound slightly more reflective, more introverted than on previous outings, and the overall message penetrates very deeply indeed.<br />Indeed, the band sound very immpressive on this release. The keyboards refrain from making the songs overblown: instead they create and sustain beautiful textures, which compliment yet never impede too much upon the tried and tested two guitar attack, histrionic vocals and charging, superb basslines.<br />As for the songs themselves: 'Moonchild' is a wonderful opener, rocking hard as it does in classic fashion yet still taking time to showcase the evolutionary sound.<br />'Infinite dreams' and 'The Evil that Men Do' are more classic Maiden, packed with hooks and rabid soloing. 'Can I Play with Madness', the hit single, is slightly more mainstream orientated and the massive sounding vocals may discourage a few, yet it is still a very upbeat, likeable number. The title track is the most ambitious composition included here: clocking in at nearly ten minutes, it includes a lengthy instrumental conclusion, bizzare mid-section and gratuitous keyboard use, yet it is perhaps the album's standout, aliong with 'The prophecy' which follows it, a perfect showcase song for maidens critics, being as it is a lilting lament, precisely spun out with acoustic guitar work at beginning and end, as well as a rousing, almost perfect chorus section.<br />'The Clairvoyant' and 'Only the Good Die Young' close a remarkable album in remarkable fashion, as well as neatly concluding the young clairvoyants tale emotively.<br />I would massively recommend this release. While it is undoubtedly a concept album, one can enjoy each track seperately, or easily digest it in a single sitting, avoiding the overwhelmed feeling concept albums can sometimes produce.<br />Also, it is a wonderful starting point for newcomers, combining typical Maiden ideas with a more accesible delivery.<br />Even if you have heard other Maiden releases, but lack this in your collection, this album is still an excellent buy, varying as it does from other material yet still retaining the bite and bark of old.<br />A vision realised.ted and the massive sounding vocals may discourage a few, yet it is still a very upbeat, likeable number.

B00000055E|5.0|It's very much a patchwork, but I like the whole thing, there's alot of those various voices Pac used to play with and theres different types of beats that are mostly good, some dj quik, one with the wind parade sample that Black Moon used for Buckemdown, and then a bunch of beats by some group of guys that use a lot of guitars, but I like them.  16 on Death Row, When I get Free, Wonder if Heaven got a ghetto, etc: 'typical' Pac fare in one way, lots about dying, but there's also a variety of differen phases, some of that real melodramatic \\"brenda got a baby\\" type stuff, before he perfected his drama.  Both cds are really good to listen to, even if there's no real \\"hits\\"
B000002O1P|5.0|In the eighties Petty could do no wrong, as this excellent album amply demonstrates. Petty's Byrds' infected roots rock predicts the whole alt-country/no depression movement of the nineties, especially with this countrified offering. Petty is rightly grouped with trad rock troubadours like Mellencamp and Springsteen, and as a songwriter he is practically peerless. Whether he's writing songs to express the prejudices of small town hicks (as in the irresistible, criminally overlooked `Spike') or creating an anthem for a generation (as in `It Ain't Nothin To Me') Petty never misses. All the tracks are excellent, so much so that the album could serve as a greatest hits for a less gifted artist, but worthy of special note are `Rebels' and `Don't Come Around Here No More'. This album is so good that even the rejects, like `Two Room Apartment' (later on FULL MOON FEVER and PLAYBACK) were superb. An excellent place to start for those unfamiliar, especially recommended to fans of Uncle Tupelo and Wilco.
B000002C25|4.0|This is probably the most underrated oasis album to date. Many oasis fans didn't like it because they weren't being objective. They were and still are comparing it to their previous release Morning Glory. And that's just not fair. Not many albums can live up to that. It's too much to ask. People's expectations were way to high for Be Here Now and they just didn't give it a chance. Some unbelievable songs appear on this cd. &quot;Fade-In Out&quot; is definitely the most underrated song and should have been a single. &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; is just as appealing, beautiful, emotionally intense and honest as &quot;Wonderwall&quot; was. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; also posssess those type of qualities and is also a very good song. &quot;I Hope, I Think, I Know&quot; is very very much underrated and contains lot's of energy people thought they were lacking. &quot;All Around the World&quot; and &quot;D'You Know What I Mean&quot; have great melodies with a real 'big' sound. But those two may have been just a little monotonous but still excellent.<BR>I really enjoyed these six songs I've mentioned and are some of the best oasis has ever put out.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Magico,Increible, Maravilloso. Este es el Mundo de Yes y su musica se muestra mas vital que nunca.Puede pasar el tiempo, las modas efimeras tuvieron su minuto de gloria, pero ese mismo tiempo pone las cosas en su lugar, y solo lo verdadero y artistico perdura a traves de los aos. Hoy este Yes es tan importante como el que grabo \\"Yessongs\\", con menos prensa , menos volumenes de venta, menos pelo PERO MUCHOS MAS SABIOS. Este Concierto de Amsterdam con la Orquesta es una muestra mas de la grandiosidad de su musica, aqui la Orquesta cumple su labor dando un nuevo color a los temas interpretados, sin intencion de reemplazar a los teclados, aqui ejecutados magistralmente pot Tom Brislim, un joven amante de la banda que toca absolutamente todo de una manera soberbia, la energia que emana en su interpretacion lo hace disfrutar como si fuera un fan arriba del escenario. Jon sigue con su misma VOZ, unica e inimitable, el es el maestro de ceremonia. Llega a los registros altos de una manera sorprendente, demostrando una vitalidad que muchos desearian poseer. Alan White es una maquina perfecta, su fuerza y exactitud llevan constantemente al grupo adelante. Steve Howe ya logro la categoria de \\"MAESTRO\\" de la guitarra. Cada dia toca mejor y su evolucion parece no detenerse, sigue abriendo caminos y no deja de sorprendernos con su virtuosiosmo.Y dejo para el final al \\"Jefe\\": Chris Squire. Su actuacion es soberbia, literalmente \\"rompe\\" el bajo y se hace fuego en cada interpretacion. Es un verdadero showman que se divierte en un escenario y transmite una energia contangiante. Asi como Jon es la VOZ, Squire es el \\"CORAZON\\" de la banda.<BR>Los temas para destacar son los tres epicos que se tocaron durante la gira de \\"Yesymphonic\\"; \\"Close to the Edge\\",\\"Gates of Delirium (sublime)y \\"Ritual\\" ( estremecedora. La fuerza qe logran cuando tocan instrumentos percusivos toda la banda menos Howe es un momento conmovedor). Todo el repertorio es magnifico y la puesta en escena es simple y efectiva. El sonido de este DVD es excelente, el balance de los instrumentos es justo y permite apreciar con sutileza la labor de la Orquesta, la cual tiene pasajes espectaculares, brillando con luz propia.<BR>En definitiva, este es el mejor DVD que saco YES, de un Concierto irrepetible y magico. Yo tuve la suerte de vivirlo en vivo en Milan en la misma gira y les puedo asegurar que el DVD capta perfectamente el clima vivido en el concierto. La labor de las camaras es insuperable y la calidad de sonido,insisto, es de lo mejor que se pudo haber logrado.<BR>Por favor, no se pierdan este DVD. Es una absoluta Obra de Arte.

B000001DQI|5.0|This album is not only one of Elton's best, it is also one of the best rock albums of all time.  The production is excellent, the music is played nearly flawlessly, the lyrics are some of the best Taupin ever wrote, and the music was consistently the best Elton has written.<br />This album starts off with the equivalent of a rock symphony, &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot;, which segues into &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot;.  &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; can't be described, only experienced.  I plan to have &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; played at my funeral, which will hopefully be very far away.<br />Everyone knows &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot;.  This version is the original, and is a moving tribute to Marilyn Monroe.<br />&quot;Bennie and the Jets&quot;.  The song is pretty good, but didn't come off quite as well as Elton wanted it to.  The crowd didn't get into it as much as was really needed.  Regardless, the lyrics and music are wonderful, and a bit of insider commentary on pop musicians and their fans.<br />&quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; is nearly a 70s pop/rock anthem.  Every greatest hits of the 70s list always includes this one.  Played heavily on top 40 radio for several years, and now frequently on classic rock stations, there are some songs that are instant classics.  This song is one such.<br />The next two songs are underappreciated and are great.  &quot;This Song Has No Title&quot; and &quot;Grey Seal&quot; are both very good songs, and play like serious music.  &quot;Grey Seal&quot; was re-done for &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot;, having been previously recorded in a style more like &quot;Empty Sky&quot;.  The original version can be found on the &quot;Rare Masters&quot; CD.  I prefer this version, which is more polished.<br />&quot;Jamaica Jerk-off&quot; is a silly song.  However, someone did their homework because while the song is a bit annoying at times, it fits well where it was positioned on the CD.<br />&quot;I've Seen That Movie Too&quot; is a bluesy song that is mellow and moving, and relates life to, what else, the movies.  If you like soft rock with a touch of heavy, this is a good song.  &quot;Sweet Painted Lady&quot; laments the life of prostitutes, and isn't condescending.  It's sad.  &quot;The Ballad of Danny Bailey&quot; should be part of a soundtrack to a movie.  It feels like a soundtrack song.  It's a bit of a story song, albeit a fictional story song.  I could have imagined this being the ballad of Clyde Barrow.  The song is very well done.  Good listening here.<br />&quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot; is lyrically a bit of a puzzler for me.  I couldn't quite devine definitively Taupin's point.  On the surface the lyrics appear to be about someone physically dirty needing a bath.  With the reference to social worker, likely someone who is poor.  But is there a point to the lyrics?  Regardless, this song is one of the rocking songs, on this CD, along with two others that appear right after &quot;All the Girls Love Alice&quot;, which is a sorrowful song about a young female lesbian.<br />Two rockers follow back-to-back, and are the fastest songs on the CD, &quot;Your Sister Can't Dance&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting&quot;.  These are songs to play at that party you were planning, along with &quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot;.  Elton John can rock when he wants to!<br />The last three songs cluster nicely, since all three deal with different topics.  The first I really enjoy, though it gives me a serious feeling of nostalgia every time I listen to it, &quot;Roy Rogers&quot;.  Not really a tribute to Roy Rogers so much as a tribute to old movies and tv shows, the feeling they give you, and memories of days gone by.<br />&quot;Social Disease&quot; is a mixture of thoughts, but the theme seems to be borderline alcohol abuse.  I say borderline because the principal character seems to like his life.  Perhaps that's an understatement.  The principal character seems to revel in his life.<br />Lastly is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, &quot;Harmony&quot;.  As happens so often with some songs, this song is flawed in that it could have been twice as long, and even then, it might not have been enough.  A very beautiful song, though there seem to be two themes intertwined that either are really the same, or really are two.  One theme is that of love by someone who is on the verge of obsession.  The other is a musical question, will I continue to be able to sing well in the future, and for how long?  Listening to the song itself you don't readily pick up on the second theme, but reading the lyrics I realized that the song could be interpreted in a second way.<br />If you like Elton's music, then you must be reading this review for curiosity, because you already have &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot;.  If you like pop/rock from the 70s, then you already have &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot;.  If you have heard music from the 70s and want to find the better music from that era, you've hit one of the best.  I believe that while the music sounds a little dated in spots, I could almost believe that released today it would still sell songs.  Perhaps it might even influence younger artists.<br />Go buy this if you don't have it.  It's one of pop/rock's greats!is life.<br />Lastly is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, &quot;Harmony&quot;.

0316666343|5.0|There isn't much I can write about this book that a million book reviewers and the 260+ online reviewers before me haven't already written, so I'll just say this... The Lovely Bones is NOT an inspirational novel. It is not a \\"lite\\" beach read. If you're looking for that, than look elsewhere. This is without a doubt the most astonishing book I've ever read.  I burst into tears in the middle of my local [bookstore] while reading the last page of the first chapter. (...) The way Sebold was able to capture Susie's gentle innocence and her murderer's remorseless brutality without using with having to use those words blew my mind in a way nothing else ever will. The remaining chapter are every bit as wonderful. I bought the book immediately after my Borders cry-fest and I've read it five times since. Alice Sebold is a genius, period. This book is brilliant, period... I will never, ever forget Susie. She IS my generation's Holden.
0316666343|5.0|It seems that some of the criticism stems from an unusual point of view (POV) -- that in which the pov is from the murdered victim.  Those who criticize The Lovely Bones for that reason must also do the same to the film American Beauty, and, moreso, The Diary of Anne Frank.  The concept of speaking beyond the grave, from Heaven in this case, is not new, but it is done well here and in a unique context -- of visualizing her death's impact on her family, and that her consciousness survives in the present tense.  That a form of contact is made serves the wishfulness of the loving survivors, and is well-within the realm of stories in which the spirit of the soul exists.  None of this denigrates the story; to the contrary, all this adds to it.  It's a story of love and want that refuses to tie all things up in neat little happy endings.  Thus the very critics, in their criticism, have defined some of the very reasons why The Lovely Bones is fine literature that will survive the years while flash-in-the-pan commercial literature will die out and be forgotten.  Open your minds, heart, and imagination, and enjoy this story of the human condition.
B000002MP2|5.0|This album set the standards bak then, for all those other punk rockers who wondered how good they were. This album made Green Day wut there were, coupe of guyz who did thier thing and made good. An inpiration to future bands suck as Blink 182, Sum 41(wannabe's!!!!!) etc. If this album did all that, made Green Day rich and Famous punks, set the standards for other punk bands, inspired famous punk rockers today, then u noe its worth listening to, so get off ur a$$ and go and buy it if u already haven't.
6300271439|1.0|Some compared this movie to 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. This is incorrect. Plan 9 is a movie that is unintentionally funny. 'Who's That Girl' is unintentionally not funny. It is more than not funny; it is at times completely, utterly and unbelievably not funny. The relationship between the Griffin Dunn and the Madonna characters is unexplained, preposterous and exceedingly tedious. All in all this is definitely a movie to miss. This is one movie that is so bad that it could not aspire to cult status.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore plays with archtypes so cleverly here that whether you love or loathe the superhero genre, you should find something here. The book is visually brilliant as well, the chapters often work as palindromes, with repeated patterns and themes. Even after a dozen readings, there's always something new to find here, the book is just that dense.
0316666343|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  I felt the author really understood emotion and the grieving process.  I enjoyed seeing the different aspect of grief and life from the point of view of many different characters.  I feel the author has great knowledge of humanity in many senses.  The Lovely Bones is a book that helps us see our own mortality and the people we touch during our lives.  It is touch and sad but overall a great great book!!
6305949980|5.0|The idea of Halloween trying to annex Christmas is wonderfully unique and played out brilliantly by a cast of unforgettable characters.  <br />Most of the film takes place in Halloween Town--a delightfully strange and eerie place inhabited by dozens of bizarre, yet lovable creatures. Most notably the main character, Jack Skelington - The Pumpkin King, who is in charge of the yearly preparations for Halloween. One day, Jack stumbles into Christmas Town, a world much more colorful and cheery than his own. Jack is so enthusiastic about Christmas that he figures why not have the residents of Halloween Town put on Christmas this year? After all, wouldn't scaring little children and delivering gifts like snakes and shrunken heads make Christmas even better?  Jack is a sweet skeleton with his heart is in the right place, however...........well, you can imagine.<br />The time and effort taken to create the stop-motion animation in NBC is mind-boggling. I still can't figure out how they created some of the effects.  This is one of those films that commands repeat viewing. I've watched the DVD several times and I always see something new that I hadn't caught before. The attention to detail is magnificent.<br />NBC is a little off the beaten path (it's rated PG), however keep in mind that even though Santa Clause (&quot;Sandy Claws&quot;) is kidnapped and held hostage, the movie has a happy ending.<br />The DVD picture and sound quality (Dolby Digital and DTS) are absolutely marvelous, and the disk is loaded with tons of wonderful extras.

0060934913|3.0|Far be it from me to pass judgment on someone else's sordid little past, but potential readers of Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential should be aware that along with peeking through back door of the restaurant kitchen, they'll be looking at the alley.  If the sexual hijinx of unwashed bodies aren't your speed, you may want to either give this book a pass or read it selectively.  If they are your speed, you'll find this book funny in spots, a cleverly-written story about one man's rise to the top through a succession of steamy little galleys and famous restaurant kitchens.<br />Anyone interested in a career in the biz will find pages 75-105 particularly valuable.  \\"How to Cook Like the Pros\\" is a quick compendium of a few tools and ingredients Bourdain considers essential to the home kitchen (he's big on shallots and butter).  \\"Owner's Syndrome and Other Medical Anomolies\\" is a cautionary glance at three types of failed restaurant owners, and \\"Bigfoot\\" is a case study of one successful example of the species.  The chapter entitled \\"So You Want to Be a Chef?  A Commencement Address\\" (pp. 293-299) is also well worth reading.<br />Serious \\"foodies\\" and those who want to read about the mystique or joy of food preparation and the restaurant industry will want to avoid this book, however, perhaps in favor of Ruth Reichl's Tender to the Bone or Debra Ginsberg's Waiting.

630514415X|4.0|Once again, rather then Spike Lee making trully great movie that will appeal to everyone; Lee injects his political/social views into what could have been a great movie. Good performances by D. Washington and rookie actor NBA star Ray Allen carry this movie. I thought the story had incredible promise, but Spike Lee once again has to inject his personal agenda while turning off 80% of the people who would go see this film. <br />First, every women featured in this film is white/latin and a whore/slut. An unusual combination considering this film is about about black inner city basketball. Not one black female shows up this film with any of kind of speaking role or substance. <br />The story turns into the absurd about half way through and stops making sense.  Also, Rick Fox is well, Rick Fox. Nuff said. Listening to him try to sound street/from the hood is very laughable. I imagined he listed to some NWA records to prep for this role. <br />The most compelling part of the movie is the climax, D Washington playing R Allen in a classic Father/son one on one battle. This scene saves the movie.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Relaxing, romantic, magical ... I think people of all ages can enjoy this cd. It's definitely soft jazz and has a lightness about it, nothing heavy musically . This is why most jazz purists will be disappointed. But I like the fact that Diana Krall is non-pretentious and is willing to give people what they want. It's also makes the perfect gift.I hope she makes more cd like this one.

6305718954|5.0|I know this movie got bad reviews. But I think this movie is a great movie. Stigmata stars Pstricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, And Jonathan Pryce. This movie is about Frankie (Arquette) who does not beleive in god. And she does not go to church> she is taking a bath and all the sudden she has 2 holes on her wrists. She goes to the emergency room, and they think she tried to kill herself. Then she is in s subway. She gets whipped in the back. Now her bleedings come to the attention of Father Kiernan (Byrne). Now he has some weird moments with her. She then writes in a language that no one knows about except Father Kirnan. But he has to ask his friend to decode it. He wants to know what it says. But this messgae could destroy the church. Now he must try to have her and the message that she is trying to say! On my scale from 0-10 Stigmata is a Fascinating, Thrilling, Mind blowing 10. I MUST SAY THIS. THIS MOVIE IS RATED \\"R\\" FOR INTENSE VIOLENT SEQUENCES, LANGUAGE AND SEXUALITY. Have fun I know I did.

0789723107|5.0|Steve Krug hits the mark with &quot;Don't Make Me Think.&quot;  His witty, common sense approach on how to make the web usable is a refreshing change of pace from the abundance of academic literature written on the subject.  Krug gives practical advice to web designers, project managers, and even the do-it-yourselfer at home and uses examples from existing web sites for illustration.  The only thing missing is a discussion of B2B web models - but hopefully Krug and other usability professionals will begin to explore this soon!
B00003CXDV|5.0|This movie is actually really well written. David Howard and Robert Gordon show a keen understanding of Star Trek lore and the cult following it's created. And at the same time, they know how to get the biggest genuine laughs without resorting to cliches or dumb gags. Tim Allen, Alan Rickman and Sigourney Weaver keep the film going at a jaunty pace, trading wisecracks at some amazing and funny special effects. If you or someone you love are into Star Trek in any way, you owe it to yourself to catch this humongous inside joke. You won't be disappointed.
B000069HKH|3.0|I bought The Rising yesterday and I've listened to it maybe three times since, wanting very much to like it. I am a big Springsteen fan, and I have loved his music for years. Unfortunately, I found this CD somewhat disappointing, especially after reading a few reviews which praised the single &quot;The Rising&quot; so much, some calling it a &quot;classic.&quot; I like some of these songs, specifically &quot;Lonesome Day,&quot; &quot;Mary's Place,&quot; (an almost great song), and &quot;You're Missing,&quot; a song that really touched me. Overall though, this is not a great piece of work and certainly not Springsteen's best work, like for example, Born To Run, Nebraska, Born In The USA, which are all truly great records, truly complete artistic statements. Anyway, perhaps it will grow on me like my copy of Lucky Town has. As I said, I like several of the songs, but the overall impact is weak, and see if I'm wrong, but there is not one single on this CD that will get played on the radio. Virtually nothing sticks with you, makes you really feel that, yeah, I know exactly what he's talking about, or I know exactly how that feels. (That's what great art does.) Moreover, I found songs like Let's Be Friends kind of . . . condescending. We all know who he's really talking about here, though it's couched in a personal relationship. It's a tad too politically heavy-handed, at least for me. So despite a cohesive theme to this CD (the 9-11 devastation), in my mind, at least so far, it fails as a total piece of work. On the other hand, not every record the guy does can be a classic. Oh well.
B00005JKTF|4.0|This movie seems to get a bad rap for strange reasons.  I had no problem whatsoever with the accents, nor did I think Cate Blanchett's wardrobe was overly nice for wartime.  (It was the FORTIES, and anyway, she's in muddy clothes for most of the film.)  My one and only complaint is that we get a clearer sense of Charlotte as Dominique than of Charlotte as Charlotte.  Things seem to progress a little too quickly early in the film, so that we don't know enough about who this girl was before she fell in love and started diving out of planes and blowing up Nazis.  (This would help make the ending a tad more powerful.)  Other than that--well played by all, very enjoyable, visually stunning, and as for the raging debate on accents, I'd like to say this: as Gillian Armstrong points out in the commentary, it's better to have British people with shallow accents than French people with accents so thick you can't understand them; Cate Blanchett was willing to do two-thirds of the film in French, but Armstrong feared criticism that her French wouldn't be perfect; and, as for those German-speaking Germans, they're foreigners taking over a foreign land.  The fact that they're not speaking the language of the audience or the language of the townspeople makes them seem more alien and menacing.  Do we desperately need to know exactly what they're saying?  No, because you can figure out that they're not saying much beyond, \\"Get zem into ze truck\\" or \\"Stop making out on ze floor, Frenchies!\\"  So sit back and enjoy.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I agree, you don't always have to \\"get\\" a movie, but there should be something intriguing and well done about it.  MD has nothing but exploitative lesbian love scenes (obviously for the sake of male viewers), a director able to manipulate the audience into thinking there's some significance behind his audio-visual ramblings, and a movie unworthy of anyone's time, money, or thoughts.<br />I even enjoyed Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and some other Lynch tales.  But he lost out on this one.  We laughed through most of it, and then fastforwarded when we couldn't even find this trash funny anymore.
0316666343|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.  I could not stop reading it. This book was riveting, suspenseful, sad, true, honest, life-like and beautifully written. After I read it, I went back and re-read the last two chapters again.  I will read this one over and over and cannot stop talking about it. Read it NOW! Do not delay.<BR>What a way to spend part of my summer vacation!
0767020308|4.0|Kate Beckinsale's interpretation of the wealthy young lady who finds that matchmaking doesn't always go as one planned and winds up finding love right under her nose is delightful to watch.  Mark Strong plays Mr. Knightley, the slightly unconventional landowner who goes from lecturing Emma to loving her (or perhaps it was both at the same time) in a convincing, reserved fashion.<br />The film contains most, if not all, of the plot elements of the novel.  Unfortunately, to make it fit in an hour and forty minutes or so, there isn't always as much flesh on those bones as one would like, and parts of the plot are hurried over quickly.  One would wish that they had done as they did with the A&amp;E Pride and Prejudice and made this a two-part, four-hour film.  Some of the cuts are ill-made.  After considerable discussion (in novel and film) of Harriet's illegitimate origins, the film never clears it up as the book does.  And, on an opposite note, the romance between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax is made too blatant.  The outcome will hardly be a surprise to the watcher, even the watcher unfamiliar with the book.<br />  Granted, Austen has very little use for the lower classes in her books--a servant is never given life, he merely serves to announce a visitor or carry a message.  That's not criticism, that is simply how it is.  But scenes of the lower classes gawking as our more wealthy characters ride through Highbury--or servants gasping as they carry heavy boxes into a house or up a hill--are interesting the first time to set forth the boundaries of Austen's world and indulge in a little commentary on same.  But the fourth time, as servants gasp as they trundle boxes down Box Hill or move pads to cushion the knees of the gentry strawberry pickers at Donwell Abbey--well, enough already.  We got your point.  Don't belabor it (pun intended).<br />Still, great to watch.  The scenery is flawless, and the acting excellent.
6305358613|1.0|I agree with the reviewer before me who listed the problems with this movie.  Though the general atmosphere and Cate Blanchett's preformances are great, the rest is grossly inaccurate.  To cite one of the many wrongs of this movie: The Duke of Norfolk, the presumed \\"villian\\" of this movie, was 80 years old at the time of MARY's coronation.  I'm not sure if he died before Elizabeth's reign, I'll have to check my facts, but the Dukes of Norfolk were related to Elizabeth I through Anne Boleyn.  They would PREFER to have Elizabeth on the throne.  Someone should definatly crack open a history book.  What's sad is that this movie deludes the public (who perhaps aren't as enlightened as Tudor history professors) from realizing the truth...
0780622553|1.0|Like The Cell, Dark City is one of those movies that *tries* to get by on its visual effects--but unlike The Cell, it fails miserably.  (The Cell also had a better storyline.)  Example of \\"outstanding visual effects\\": A guy puts a fish in a sink...and we see it from the THE SINK'S POINT OF VIEW! Wow! [Note the heavy use of sarcasm.]  When will these boneheads who direct music videos realize that such \\"style\\" doesn't translate to film effectively?  David Fincher understood that; why can't you guys?<br />As far as the \\"plot\\" goes, the movie starts off like a bad 80s PC adventure/role-playing game.  You know the type--your character wakes up in a bathtub in a small, stark bathroom lit by a single lightbulb descending from the ceiling on a cord.  On the seat next to him is a pair of boots and a trenchcoat.  Type 'Look coat' to find a matchbook, a phone number, blah blah blah.  Hey look, it's David Goyer showcasing his weak writing skills!  (Side note: Goyer's Blade script wasn't too bad, but have you ever seen the original ending to that flick?  They had to call in a script doctor to perform an emergency feces-ectomy.)  And what was the deal with the \\"ACME Plot-Resolver\\" in the form of a syringe filled with a mystery chemical that instantly \\"educates\\" your protagonist (in this case, the wall-eyed Rufus Sewell) so he can adequately fight the \\"ba(l)d guys\\"?  That wins the award for the Single Dumbest Idea in Modern Film.<br />On top of all that, the acting was below average.  Rufus \\"I do a good 'confused guy'\\" Sewell was ok, but I don't know what kind of accent Kiefer Sutherland was using for his ambiguously-scarred \\"mad scientist\\" character.  And I'm sorry to say, Jennifer Connelly is nothing great--in terms of looks or acting skills--so she can't even offer a decent T&A Quotient to elevate this movie to an 'F+'.<br />To sum up, the writing is amateurish, the direction is poor, and the acting mediocre (at best).  Other than that, it's a great movie.  Thankfully Roger Ebert and his *keen* critical skills saw through the myriad layers of bad filmmaking and placed it in the highly-coveted \\"Best Films of 1998\\" category.  [More heavy use of...oh, forget it.]
0553278223|5.0|When I read Ray Bradbury books I cannot shake off the feeling that reality is constantly replaced with fantasy and fantasy is replaced with reality.  What is what and where one becomes the other I do not know.  And I do not want to know; I just do not want the book to be over.
0345404475|3.0|Not to upset all you Bladerunner supplicants, but I thought this book was a little disappointing. (I quite honestly found Bladerunner a little disappointing too, since I saw it several years after my friends had filled my ears with praise for the flick.)  Still, the story gives an interesting glimpse into the world of Philip Dick, who was nothing if not creative.  (He also had less than a clean bill of mental health, but perhaps he's another example of madness being the flip-side of genius...)  In a nutshell, check this out at your local library, and if you like it, pick up more of his stuff--he's written quite a few books.  I've heard _A Scanner Darkly_ is a good one, so you might want to check that out.
0880389052|5.0|I was hesitant to pick up \\"Homeland\\" because it is part of the \\"Forgotten Realms\\" series, which at first seemed to me to be a big fantasy world that was full of many cliches and no originality. I cannot believe that I thought this as R.A. Salvatore delivers an orginal, entertaining, and fast paced read here. This the first novel of \\"The Dark Elf Trilogy\\" by Salvatore and this trilogy is now one of my favorites. As other reviewers have stated, R.A. Salvatore has a distinct writing style that is keen on detail, character development, world building, and full of talent. <br /> The main race in this novel is the Drow, who are dark elves with black skin and white hair. Most of the other races find the Drow to be a terrible race with bad habits and lots of evil. The Drow live beneath the surface of the fantasy world that we learn more about later in a city called Menzoberranzan. There are many houses in the city and the book opens up with House Do'Urden destroying another house so that they can be closer to being able to hold much power. On this night Matron Malice, the head of the house, gives birth to Drizzt Do'Urden. This book is the story of Drizzt's first years as he trains to become a warrior, then going to school. We learn that Drizzt is different from other Drow in that he holds a different view on everything and is against many things of the Drow. As the series progresses into the next novel we learn more of this.<br /> Drizzt Do'Urden is one of the best fantasy characters that have ever been written. It is entertaining to see him grow throughout the novel to the person that he really is. Drizzt has his weaknesses and his strengths, and everything is clearly defined here. While Drizzt is the main character and the most likeable of the Drow, the other characters are well developed too. For example, his mother Matron Malice is done well, and so is Zaknafein, one of Drizzt's mentors. <br /> In addition to specific characters being interesting, the race of the Drow is interesting. Their social structure and how they function is amazingly interesting while being very believable. Their religon in their worship of the Spider Queen, Lloth, is interesting to see. Everybody is always trying to please their goddess. The city that the Drow live in is interesting as well, and furthermore, the whole Underworld functions just like a real world, with many races, ways to survive, issues, and much more. <br /> The amount of things that are packed into this little novel is amazing; and this is just book one of the trilogy. The rest of the series gets more amazing as it progresses, so definitely do not stop with this book. R.A. Salvatore is a skilled writer and his skills are evident here. \\"Homeland\\" is a superb start to \\"The Dark Elf Trilogy.\\" <br />Happy Reading!
B00005JKG7|4.0|I caught this for the first time on a cable movie channel a couple weeks ago.  Although I didn't find it all that scary, I enjoyed the overall story and the general \\"campiness\\" of an early 80s horror flick.  The acting wasn't all that great, but the premise was not bad.  Rather than delving too far into the virtues and flaws of the movie, however, I'll discuss the merits of owning the DVD:  This Special Edition takes advantage of most of the good features the medium permits--an audio commentary, outtakes, a couple of \\"making of\\" featurettes.  And these all come at a pretty cheap price.  So buy it.  Now.  Or feel Rob Bottin's fake glowing eyes burning your soul for eternity!  Or at least until the batteries run out.

B00006472M|5.0|This movie is what got me hooked to Bette Midler as I got a chance to see it when I was a pre, preteen in the mid 90s. Bette Midler fascinated me with the redhaired and the comedic, weird performance. In fact this also hooked kind of to the other performers-Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy and Thora Birch. Many people dub this movie as a bomb when it really isn't as it made $40 million at the box office when it came out and a respectable return from rentals. The actors do a great job as the children awaken withces three hundred years later who were hung and killed by the village people. The witches must suck the lives from one of the children before the sun rises so that they can live forever. THe withces steal the show with a song that they sing and this walk in which they say HUNHH, HUNHH as well as how well they play off one another as almost THREE STOOGES female counterparts. Great for the kids and the family in general!!

B000066C1N|5.0|'Spirit - Stallion of the Cimarron' is by far the best animated movie for a looooong time (since snow white)and my favourite movie of all time, and a lot of that has to do with the music. There's just something in Bryan Adams's voice that brings out the old West, the hars, dry deserts and rough beauty. And his songs are great, especially combined with Hans Zimmer's score (which is awesome and totally brings out the spirit of the movie). My favourite track is still &quot;Homeland&quot;, the music to the introduction of the movie: the theme fits in perfectly with the eagle and buffaloes and wild horses, and the amazing scenery. Favourite BA track, &quot;Get off my back&quot;! such a contrast to all his other songs, which are all heavily emotional. Light and fun!<br />Overall, great soundtrack. I would have liked it if they added more of Hans Zimmer's stuff though (like they did in the Prince of Egypt soundtrack)
B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising is as close to a \\"perfect\\" recording as I have ever heard.  Springsteen's lyrics perfectly and brilliantly capture the aftermath of September 11th.  At times angry, but often sad, The Rising constantly reminds us of the sadness that we all felt on September 11th, but reduces the sadness to a personal level without sensationalism, and without feigned pity.  The Rising ultimately is Springsteen's profession of faith in all of us, that we can overcome the sadness of September 11th, and ends on a hopeful note.  The lyrics are stunningly beautiful, and the accompanying music is powerful.  The Rising is Springsteen is at his best (which is really saying something, considering that he is a truly great artist).  A definite \\"must have\\" for Springsteen fans, and a great introduction for those not yet familiar with his other great works, such as Darkness On the Edge of Town, and Born to Run.
0393312836|5.0|This is a simply superb American novel, as disturbing as it is riveting.  <br />The novel follows Alex and his troupe of marauding friends as they happily go about murdering, stealing and terrorizing in their superviolent world of the not-too-distant future.  Burgess tells the story from Alex's point of view, giving the reader tremendous insight into the sadistic and troubling inner-workings of the \\"protagonist's\\" mind.  This choice of narrative point of view has an interesting effect: while the reader can't help but be disturbed by the senseless violence perpetrated by Alex and his posse, readers will find themselves actually caring for and understanding Alex (most of us have at least a little bit of Alex in us).  <br />When Alex is finally arrested for his horrible crimes, the government seeks to inflict its own version of violence upon him, trying to reprogram his perversely violent mind into the mind of a peaceful, law-abiding citizen.  The moral implications are obvious and troubling: can society violate someone's free will to make them peaceful and good?  <br />The novel is perhaps most famous for the futuristic slang language (\\"Nadsat\\") that Burgess interweaves throughout the dialogue.  The use of this language may be a bit confusing at the very beginning of the novel, but Burgess eases the reader into it, making it easy to understand quite quickly.  Some readers may need to read sections a few times initially to get comfortable with the vocabulary. Despite this smattering of peculiar words, the book reads surprisingly fast.<br />Many people are more familiar with Stanley Kubrick's famous on-screen adaptation of this novel but it is important to note that this edition of the book contains Burgess' original 21st chapter which was omitted from the first US editions and from Kubrick's movie version. <br />All in all, this is a fantastic novel that will present readers with multitude of emotions.  At times the book can be horrifying, at other times, heart wrenching, and at other times, downright funny.  The novel's plot is certainly strong enough to stand on its own, but what makes the book a classic is its thought-provoking attempt to examine the role of free will and the role of society in promoting good, regardless of the costs.
B0000640VO|5.0|This film is so entertaining. Audrey Tautou is a doll and this is unlike anything else I've seen.  And I've seen maaaaany films. It's original, funny, cute, witty, and gorgeous.  I don't know how anyone could not like it.<br />The picture was tinted green digitally, so don't think that's a Paris thing.  It is beautiful and colorful throughout with great sets and Paris locations.  It has a great French-sounding instrumental soundtrack.  Interesting camera movement and angles and quick editing add to the effectiveness of the great story.  There is a quirkiness to it in style and characters that is similar to Jean-Pierre Jeunet's other films like Delicatessan and City of Lost Children.  I saw Delicatessan on cable many years ago, so I can't really compare the two.  I recently rented City of Lost Children.  Liked it, but I love Amelie.  France has yet another beautiful actress on their hands.  Hope to see much more of Miss Tautou in the years to come.  She's a good reason to start liking subtitles.<br />Probably my favorite film of the last year and certainly on my all-time favorites list.  I couldn't believe it lost to No Man's Land for the Best Foreign Film Oscar.  Probably because it doesn't make any political statements.  I saw both.  No contest.  My only \\"complaint\\" is that is seemed a bit long.  <br />Buy it.  Rent it.  Whatever.  Just see it because it's a charmer.
B000002LQR|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are arguably the best group to mix hip hop and rock together, and this album states their case nicely. Of course there are the hits Suck My Kiss,Give It Away and my favorite Under The Bridge, but the rest of it is fun and compelling as well. Go get it!

B00005JL1C|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time and by far the best movie of the '80s.  We all went to high school with these people, we all loved or hated them depending on where we stood.  It's like going back again without the bad hair cuts and tacky clothes.   <br />This is a great little movie about falling in love.  And I must add that &quot;the kiss&quot; in this movie is perfection.  Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson made you feel it... all the way to your toes.
B00005YXZH|4.0|You have probably herd the long story of what it took to bring this album to market.  It is told as a parable of all that is wrong in the music industry today.  However, I cannot blame the record executives for their error.  At first listen this album sounded terrible.  The first tract sounded horrid, like some bad county western karaoke.  Whenever I play the album for somebody else they give me a funny look and slowly back away like there dealing with a crazy man. :-)  However I kept trying, I listened to the entire album, then I did it again.  Somehow it started to grow on me.  The songs are diverse.  They are sprinkled with carefully calculated noise and distortion, the melodies seem to emerge out of nowhere.  Some songs are hauntingly beautiful like \\"Jesus ect.\\" &amp; \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" others are great pop pieces.  This album is a case of the whole being more then the sum of its parts.  No song is a standout but the album just sounds right.  If you decide to purchase it, don't be turned off by first impressions and give it a chance.  You'll be glad you did.
B000002C25|5.0|Yup, I've heard all the criticisms before, it's no What's The Story, It's no Definetely Maybe, it's too long, etc....! But you know what, I wouldn't want it any other way! Be Here Now is a hidden gem. Yes, the album is a long one, clocking in at around the 70+ min mark, but who cares?! All tracks are very solid, but I will admit that chances are you won't fall in love with them on the first listen. Standout tracks: Do You Know What I Mean, Stand By Me, It's Getting Better (Man!!). Don't listen to the naysayers regarding album. Trust me, if you're just getting into Oasis, you'll have no regrets about buying Be Here Now.
B00004XQ83|5.0|BEST CD EVER.<BR>I HAVE LISTENED TO IT OVER 500 TIMES EASY.
B0000508U6|4.0|Huh?  Well yeh...look at it this way, maybe some old Prog-Rock fans can relate if, say, I mention an example of some old album that was an essential buy like Traffic's \\"Low Spark Of The High-Heeled Boys\\" - a great everlasting anthem (title track), a darn good alt-FM staple (Rock and Roll Stew), and maybe something else to capture your interest, and the rest, you can easily pass on.  Here, in Parachutes, that great everlasting anthem is \\"Shiver\\", the durable alt-FM staple role is conceived in \\"Trouble\\", and the third interest is \\"Yellow\\".  Oh, the opening track moves nicely, and is actually an ideal lead in to the indispensable \\"Shiver\\".  Hear me, you old school Rock fans, my age, this one packs a wallop as good as anything by the Who, although that is Hendrixian guitar that is allowed to bawl its head off here and there in the masterpiece.  Once you've gotten past the gorgeous Trouble, this album is over for all practical purposes, that is, if your purpose is peak-experience music listening, and those previous tracks, mentioned above have already wetted your appetite.  There's still engaging poetry to be found in the last few tracks, but musically, it wanders off (off I say) like desultery Winwoodian musical half-cooked musings at their worst.  In other words, I'll give the first 6/10ths of this album 5-stars plus, and I'm behooved to give an honest rating of four overall, so no one actually feels misled about value here.  But this really should be in your collection and not wait until a possible (not necessarily probable) anthology appears later.  You are not hip anymore if you are not acquainted with music as great as Shiver, or Trouble.  And Eric me no Claptons or Jack me no Bruces about that  (yes, I am writing for those claim they can't relate to the 90's or the new years, they need to wake up and smell the coffee).
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane is not the best movie of all time,because there is no one movie that can be considerd to be better than any other. The only film that you can say is the best is your personal favorite, but that is an individual thing and not an overal sweeping statement. But what is undeniable is that Citizen Kane is one of, if not the, most influential films of all time. My personal opinion is that Citizen Kane is one of the best movies of all time. It is not my all time favorite, The Passion of Joan of Arc is, but it is certainly on my short list of all time favorites. So my opinion is watch it, if you like it, fine, if you dont, thats fine to, but if you are lover of films like i am, you realy should see this film at least once, if not twice, if for nothing else than to see the film that ifluenced so many other films and filmmakers since.
B000002H97|5.0|This album is consistently in the top 20 on Billboard's Pop Catalog chart for best selling albums over 2 years old...and for good reason.  Sure, we've all heard the brilliant hit singles such as Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Sad But True, etc.  But this album is much more than that...its lesser-known tracks like The God That Failed, Holier Than Thou, and My Friend of Misery shine just as bright as their radio-played counterparts...and the tracks I didn't mention are stellar in their own right.  So basically, I'm saying this an absolutely flawless album...a masterpiece by one of today's premiere bands.  Every fan of rock/metal truly owes it to themselves to have this album!
B000063S6Z|5.0|Maybe you think that 18 is not near as good as Play, but to me that is not the case. 18's We Are All Made Of Stars was so incredibly touching. You should buy this CD. If it cost 100 dollars, i would still buy it.
0316666343|5.0|this was a very good book, i could not put it down! although it was a little disgusting in details i thouroughly enjoyed it. i have never experienced such a moving and erie feeling in my life. Thank you Alise Sebold for writing this book.
0767836324|5.0|&quot;A children, except for one, grow up.&quot; So starts a classic tale that has captured children's imaginations for generations. I have never met anyone who didn't know the story of Peter Pan, nor have I ever known a person who at some point in their childhood didn't vow to never grow up. When I was very young, though, the thought crossed my mind, &quot;What if Peter Pan did grow up?&quot; For those who wonder, we have Hook.<br />Unfortunately, this movie is highly under-rated for petty reasons. Some people claim that the modernizing of the Lost Boys was wrong because there was no basketball or skateboards when the book was written. You can make many excuses as to why Spielberg made that choice, but there is a very practical reason for it - if this movie was released to children in the 1990s then the children would have to be able to idenify with the Lost Boys, recognize that they were living a life of fun and adventure - by modern standards. The other critisicm is usually directed towards Spielberg himself, saying that he needed to stop doing children's movies. That is, of course, ridiculous. Spielberg is the ultimate storyteller, no matter what story he chooses, and no one has the right to tell him what kind of movies he should be doing.<br />The truth is, the movie is magical. When I first watched it as a little girl in the movie theatre I was blown away. Robin Williams was the perfect Peter Pan, and made a wonderful transition betweeen the cold business man to his old alter ego. Maggie Smith gives a moving performance as Wendy. I remember watching the scene where Peter's son Jack tells Wendy what Peter does for a living and Jack tells Wendy about how his father &quot;sails in, and if there's any resistance he blows them out of the water!&quot; My heart caught in my chest as I saw Wendy, with a mix of amusment and sadness on her face say, &quot;So... Peter you've become a pirate!&quot;<br />On the other side you have a brilliant portrayal of the terrible Captain Hook by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman puts his own brilliant twist on the role, but still leaves the quirkyness, humor and tragedy of the Hook we all adore. Bob Hoskins compliments him perfectly with his performance as Smee. <br />There is a lot of sadness to this movie as the audience sees that the Peter Pan everyone has known has forgotten how to fly, fight and crow. It broke my heart when the Lost Boys finally realize that Williams really is Peter Pan and you hear one of them say, &quot;Peter... you grew up. You promised never to grow up Peter.&quot; We get our Peter Pan back, of course, and with the accompniment of another amazing John Williams score we feel the magic of Neverland once more.<br />Who will like this movie? It depends on what kind of person you are. Some say it's too long, but as a child my eyes never left the screen for a moment. The REAL question is - Do you believe? Yes, that's the question - Do you believe that Neverland is really just a place between sleep and awake... that it's all a dream? Or do you believe it's really there - you've got your happy thought, you believe in fairies and you're ready to fly on the back of the wind?<br />If you believe the latter, if you are a child at heart, then this movie will touch a special place in your soul - the place that never grew up...
B0000507PC|4.0|This is a terrific movie. John Irving was able to boil the story down from his very lengthy, over-wrought novel about the St. Cloud orphanage to its true essence and provide a very satisfying tale of life in the earlier part of the century when orphans homes were the only haven for many unwanted children.<br />Tobey Macguire plays Homer with great sympathy and is completely believable. I still have not figured out the meaning of the Cider House Rules or its impact on the story, but I'm ploughing my way through the book in hope of enlightenment.
B00005MAM2|5.0|First thing.  I LOVE THIS FILM.  It is one of the most culturally and technologically significant films ever made.  If you haven't seen it, stop reading this review and go see it.  Not kidding.  Rent it or borrow it or something.  If THAT doesn't make you want it, I don't know what will.<br />Now.<br />This, as I said, is a little gripe.  I am currently using a PlayStation 2 for a DVD player.  For the most part, I have no major gripes.  However, I do know that there are a handful of DVDs that don't play well with it.  Sadly, this is one of them.  It works BEST if you use the original drivers (not the ones that come with the Sony DVD remote, which is unfortunate because I'm sure there are a few features I'm missing because of that).  It will play with the original PS2 release drivers (it gets midway through with the DVD remote drivers and stops).  I'm planning to buy another DVD player anyway (probably an all region one), so this will probably be a minor issue....<br />Now, please do yourself a favor and make sure you get a copy, okay?  You won't be sorry.  The new transfer rocks, the new english dub is WAY better than the last VHS release, and the subtitles are equally as good as the new dub.  Add a host of nifty extras which will inform and entertain (not to mention the A-Z of AKIRA which will probably help clear up any remaining confusion about what just happened after you watch the film), and a nifty (albeit oversized) metal DVD case (OK, the tray's a little tricky, just be careful when removing the discs!), and you have a nice gift for yourself or that someone special.<br />(ahem) BUY IT! BUY IT NOW! RIGHT NOW! CLICK THE BUTTON, CLICK THE BUTTON!
B0000640SB|5.0|men in black 1 &amp; 2 both rock. the men in black are a top secret agency that deals with aliens. buy this movie.
B000002JNJ|4.0|This  was my first album, and a good heavy metal album to start with.  If are getting in to heavy metal, or are new to music, I would start with speed metal, and possibly this album.  It sounds great, and isn't very deppressing.  Phillip Anselmos voice, tops many other song artists, and has a huge range.  Though Pantera is compared to Limp BIzkit, they are much more talented and much better.  Cowboys from Hell and Cemetary Gates are the best songs on this album.  This is a good album, the best Pantera one, but the song's order is rather poorly organized (putting Domination, then Shattered after Cemetary Gates.)  Pantera isn't as heavy as death metal, and isn't as deppresing, as death metal, or grunge, and though i do like bands like Opeth, and In Flames, or Grunge, like Alice in Chains, it is good to start with.  Also try Mettalica's black album, or, my favorite, Master of the Puppets.
6303314015|5.0|After watching Aladdin and Beuty and The Beast I disn't know what disney could come up with. When the Lion King came out on video i watched it over and over again. This movie has some of the best animation I have ever seen in a disney movie and the Wildebeest stampede was one of the best climax seens i've ever seen. Take my advice and GET THIS MOVIE! (If your poor well......to bad).
B000002MY3|4.0|If you are depressed and need cheering up, this album is definately the cure. With the acoustic and electric sound of Alanis Morisettes album, you will be pressing repeat far too many times. For children, teens, and adults this album is the perfect chillout.
0316666343|5.0|The odd title (not connected to the crime) and cover art attracted me to this book, as I had not previously heard of the author.  I was immediately intrigued with the narrator and her detached perspective about her demise.  Instead of being thrown into the horror of it all, the reader is carefully given a glimpse of all that happens afterward.  Through Susie, we are privy to the feelings and changes that her father, mother, younger sister and brother all experience.  She is with them.  We hear what her friends think and know, what they wish for.  And time passes; life goes on for them all as Susie watches.  The poignancy of all life's significant events are not lost to her, but we know Susie's pain about the loss of an earthly life, of not being able to participate in all that life offers.<br />If someone approached this book thinking it to be a murder mystery, rushing through the beautiful language, the myriad personae Siebold presents to us so eloquently, wanting some kind of solution to the crime, then they will have missed the whole point of the book.  We know \\"who done it\\" in the first chapter.  This book is about people and the effect of a senseless act on their lives.  Too often in our world, those who have lost someone in this fashion never have a resolution.  Siebold has given us an idea of what that must be like.  For Susie, there is a resolution, and we do obtain satisfaction from that.<br />Truly one of the most beautifully written books I have read.  How refreshing to have gotten a new and blissfully different perspective on heaven and what an afterlife could be like.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|The version of the unforgiven shown here is better than my own copy of the movie on video tape because in Europe the dvd had no extras but the video tape had the making of the movie its an incredable documentry. The movie itself has some of the best character protralys I have ever seen in film from Richard Harris playing a blow hard gunfighter to Eastwood himself showing us the fear and disgust of what he has done with his life so far \\" I've killed everthing at one time\\" Hackman is exellent as little Bill the town sherrif and Morgan Freeman rounds out a cast of classic actors who bring the script to life. I highly recommend this movie, as a highlight to Eastwoods career it ranks form me up there with The Wild Bunch and The Searchers.
B000002H72|4.0|My musical tastes usually run more towards punk and hardcore so for me this pop album is kind of a guilty pleasure.  Black Francis writes good quirky lyrics (Sample: \\"slicing up eyeballs ah ha ha ho\\") and has great vocal delivery and musically, the band was really innovative.  This album lay the ground work for alternative rock in the nineties while still managing to be better than 90% of true alternative rock.  The only real dull parts for me are \\"la la love you\\" and \\"silver.\\"  The rest of this album is great, especially \\"Debaser\\" \\"Gouge Away\\" and \\"Mr Grieves.\\"
B00006FR47|5.0|This was the first album, that introduced me to CHICAGO<BR>TRANSIT AUTHORITY,later just changed to Chicago. Great songs<BR>like \\"all is well\\"\\"state of the union\\" and the classic song<BR>\\"saturday in the park\\". When I first heard this I was in my<BR>high school \\"stage band\\" and we played \\"goodbye\\" and<BR>\\"saturday in the park\\". This album marked a big change in the<BR>band,pushing them into a sort of \\"jazz\\" band. the album has<BR>more 7th chord structuring,and gave it a \\"laid back feel\\",<BR>but keep up with bands like Blood ,Sweat & Tears, Chase,<BR>and even Earth,Wind and Fire. Amazon is offering a great<BR>deal by getting Chicago II and Chicago V (the wood cover album)<BR>as it was known as. With these two different album(CDS),you will<BR>hear the great song like \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" and \\"make me smile\\" and<BR>do the listening contrast yourself. Did you know that the<BR>song \\"make me smile\\" is not just that short song ,but a melody<BR>of different passages.Listen to it! Chicago V,you need to check<BR>great re-issue CD out!!!
0316666343|5.0|This is one novel I rushed through not just because it was well-written and fascinating (and it is both of those things) but also because I really didn't want to stop somewhere and be stuck in the grieving process.  I wanted to proceed with the book so that I wouldn't have to linger with the family of a girl who was brutally raped and killed and sit in their skin as her whereabouts remain a mystery.<br />The scope is really rather small for a book which takes on the issue of what happens after one dies.  Sebold gives a quick outline of how Susie's heaven seems, what it feels like for her and how it changes as she allows the past to recede from her.  However, there is no real emphasis on what this heaven is and who goes there.  Is there an alternative place?  Will Susie's killer ultimately wind up near her?  These questions aren't really Sebold's concern.  Even so, the tight coil of pain that grips Susie's family is stunning to encounter.<br />By the end, I was a little weary of the one character who seems to have a paranormal connection to Susie and all her dead (and surprisingly anonymous) friends.  Ruth is reduced to a conduit for Susie's earthly concerns and Sebold carries this to its ultimate conclusion in a way that really does border on the truly creepy.  However, the novel steps away from the flirtation with ghostliness and really does try to examine how horror enters our lives so swiftly and devastatingly and yet it does get better.  <br />The excrutiating process is genuinely credible, especially in the cases of the father and sister.  The mother's ultimate vacation from the pain seems vague and surreal but is not entirely bizarre in the face of her loss.<br />All this being said, though, this is not a novel that stays with you.  It is absolutely riveting while you're reading but it is so specific to this family's loss that it lacks the resonance of loss that one might expect.<br />Is it better than most things out there?  Yes, it is but that probably won'tgive this novel the sort of afterlife to which it aspires.
B0000507R0|5.0|I've been a fan of ELP since I first heard Tarkus in the early '70s. Saber rattling, aggressive, over the top rock-n-roll. ELP was at the forefront of progressive rock, blending classical, jazz and rock in a frantic keyboard driven fusion.  ELP's music is more complex than any other rock band I am aware of.  ELP was not only complex in the scope of the music, but often used complex 5/4 and 7/4 time signatures, which only jazz great Dave Brubeck and classical composers would dare use.  They are as dark as Pink Floyd could ever be and just a touch more complex and grand in scope than the best work by Yes.  And they manage to make this amazing music, which at times has the scope and feel of a whole symphony, with only three musicians and without any overdubs.<br />Brain Salad Surgery is, in my opinion, a bit more commercial sounding and formulaic than ELP's first four albums; however, it is arguably their best album.  The highlights of the album are the three \\"impressions\\" of \\"Karn Evil 9\\" and \\"Tocotta,\\" an adaptation of Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto.   The dark influence of Peter Sinfield's is apparent in \\"Karn Evil 9.\\"  (Sinfield was given credit for \\"words and illumination\\" on King Chrimson's album \\"In the Court of the Chrimson King.\\")  \\"Tocotta\\" is a tour-de-force both for Emerson and for Karl Palmer, whose lightning fast drum solo is used to key synthesizers.  On the DVD-Audio version, they also throw in Lucky Man from the first ELP album.<br />If you own the album, you should still buy this DVD because of the sound quality. I have the album on black vinyl (for those who remember playing LPs on turntables) and CD and very simply, this blows both out of the water. Everything is just so clean sounding. The grumble and edge in Greg Lake's voice appears. The synthesizers are crystal sharp, and the drums jump out. If you are an ELP fan with a DVD player and fair surround system, buy it.
B000002L9M|5.0|Another great DM album with authentic DM style gloom and doom.<BR>All the tracks are worth listening to.  It is dificult to mention a single track that completely stands out because the entire album shines, but just to name a few tracks at randon are Black Celebration, Fly on the Windscreen, Stripped, and the beautiful Martin sung \\"A question lust\\".  An album for the truly devoted DM fan.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have recently acquired. My favourite tracks include Losing Grip, I'm With You and Things I'll Never Say. Ok, so she may not be as completely punk as she would like to think but each song on the album has a strong chorus and a catchy tune that will leave you wanting to listen to it again. I think people who are slating this album haven't given it enough of a chance, no one said she had to be hardcore punk. In my opinion she rocks and i advise anyone thinking about getting this to hurry up and do just that! Ignore the critics, she rocks! :)
6302373921|5.0|This is the best DM video that is out.  101 is a fantastic video to watch.  You get to see Depeche Mode live and backstage and in personal chats and filming of their life during the Music for the Masses tour.  101 follows Depeche Mode to their outstanding and mindblowing performance at the Rose Bowl in June of 1988.  Along the way 101 also features a bunch of DM fans that follow the band to the Rose Bowl.  That can be a bit boring to watch.  I just fast forward to the scenes of the Depeche Mode members and when they are onstage performing.  The best part of this video the last thirty minutes or so of the video that is basically like watching a DM performance live on tape.  It features Depeche Mode performing at the Rose Bowl one great song after another in front of the biggest crowd that they have ever performed for.  It is definitely a beautiful and sentimental feature to watch.  This is a DM fans most prized posession.
B000002U82|5.0|Until recently I had never listened to Dark Side all the way through. I had basically heard \\"Time\\" and \\"Money\\" on the radio and didn't realize that there was much more to the album. When I listened to the album three times in a row while watching \\"The Wizards of Oz,\\" (no I wasn't on drugs) I realized how great this album actually is. You must listen to this album straight through in order to do it justice. Some of the songs are masterpieces by themselves, but the album as a whole has so much continuity that it sounds like the best 43 minute song ever made. This album is definitely an example of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. DSOTM is a must have for any music collection.
B000002LK1|4.0|This is Depeche Mode's most well known and most successful album till date.  This album contains the band's top single tracks, Enjoy the Silence, Personal Jesus, and Policy of Truth.  This is a good album with good quality Depeche Mode music and the singles Enjoy the Silence and Personal Jesus make this album worth having.  Both of those tracks are great and Depeche Mode classics.  This is definitely a DM album to have in your collection of classics.
0380977788|2.0|I originally read a review of \\"Coraline\\" in an article posted on the web that sited itself as belonging to some magazine or other, such as \\"Time\\".  The review gushed about Gaiman's brilliance, his ability to capture both adult and young audiences with the novel, claiming it was in the tradition of such greats as Dahl or Carroll, and might even rival the popularity of J.K. Rowling and the infamous \\"Harry\\".  I found absolutely no cause for such praise as this.  The book does not match, in my opinion, the captivating characterization of Rowling's Potter series, nor does it touch the surrealistic beauty of Alice's Wonderland.  The oompa-loompa vibe is all that remains of Dahl's style, and even that is muted to the point of boring one to tears.  Harsh words, but true, nonetheless.  By the end of the relatively brief novel, I was skimming pages, anxious to have finished it once and for all.

0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is damnably funny.  But it suffers as Monty Python's &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot; does - without a defined plot, it is incapable of sustaining a compelling narrative.  Its midsection is bogged down with situations invented solely to amuse.  It begins wonderfully and ends well, but the middle lays on the black comedy too thick.  Heller tries too hard to be funny, and it turns repetitive, which makes it difficult to read all the way through. <br />There are many, many characters.  For a comedy they fit their purpose, but as a novel some are simply superfluous, inflating an already long book to even longer proportions.  Scheisskopf, for example, in addition to being needlessly vulgar (German for &quot;s**t-head&quot;), has no effect on the plot, nor influence on any characters.  Had Heller exercised his right to excise, he could have safely clipped 100 pages.  Do we need 2 separate chapters on Milo's escapades as a celebrated food smuggler?  Ideas once fresh run foul by the final 3rd of the book's length.  <br />Yet Catch-22 is brilliant, despite these surface flaws.  The humor is definitely funny the characters memorable, if ersatz, and the rapport between soldiers seemingly real and certainly surreal.  But only brilliant, not genius.  Slaughterhouse-5 is genius - similarly, it paints World War 2 as absurd, poignant, and occasionally home to black humor, but Vonnegut's book dives deep into a few subjects while Catch-22 chooses to skim lightly over several.
1590710037|5.0|A book to read and reread. Focused, lasered and rich in understanding the nature and expression of resistance and much, much more. Worth getting.
0679735909|5.0|There is little to say about this novel that hasn't already been said considering the praise that critics and readers have heaped on to it over the past decade.  Byatt's Romance (this is less of a novel than an imaginative fairy tale of people coming together) takes readers through a nearly detective like adventure featuring two young literary scholars unearthing a love affair in letters between a famous Victorian poet (very similar to Robert Browning) and a more obscure one that has been embraced by gender studies and feminist scholars (reminiscent of Christina Rossetti).<br />Possession is constructed of letters from the Victorian poets, their actual poetic work and stories, diary entries, and narrative featuring the modern scholars coming together and the poets coming together.  The Victorians begin to act as a mirror world for the modern lovers.  At times the narrative surprises you making you think it is describing the Victorian period when in reality it is modern London.  Byatt does an amazing job impersonating the form and style of the two Victorian poets, mimicking writers like Pater, Robert Browning, and Christian Rossetti with such accuracy that it is a brilliant achievement that she has invented the verse for her characters herself.<br />While the work is quite lengthy its pace is fast as the scholars (and you as the reader) discover more clues in the detective/mystery style adventure, and the length allows Byatt to throughly develop her themes.  Readers should watch out for the theme of possession and ownership itself.  In the novel words on a page become debated over who they belong to: a nation, the writer, the writer's descendants, the readers, or the world as a whole?  Also the various types of scholarship are mocked as well: silly and ridiculous Freudian and gender readings of sexual landscapes, professors more interested in collecting souveneirs than studying text, and fierce, reckless competition among people that at first glance may seem dull andstale.<br />For readers approaching the text after seeing the movie be advised- the novel features different characters and builds ideas and concepts more than the film does, and it is not just a straight objective narrative since it is filled with poems and letters and other discourse.  However, the read is exciting and lavish and presents you with ideas about our relationship to history and language that the film, because of its medium, was not able to put across as well.  I recommend this book whole heartedly and if I wasn't a poor lowly literature grad student I would reimburse everyone with complaints.  Can you give a better recommendation than that?
B000000WA4|3.0|\\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" is a decent 90s rock albums equipped with much ecclecticism.  Billy Corgan crafted a magnum opus of sorts with this album, incorporating elements of pop, metal, psychedelia, techno, new wave, 70s rock, and classical into a rich musical style.  His stream-of-consciousness lyrics and his nasal voice together instilled a mood of brooding depression that would put most metal bands to shame.  Most of the 28 songs here were well-written and adeptly performed, swimming in clanging guitars, melodic keyboards, quaint pianos, and a jazzy rhythm section.  \\"1979\\" is one of the best songs I've ever heard, with its contagious drum pattern and its sublime melody; odd that it was the last tune to make the cut!.  Classics such as \\"Zero\\" and \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" are both angry and hummable, but the true strength of this album rested in its more obscure, artful songs, such as \\"Thru the Eyes of the Ruby,\\" \\"Stumbeline,\\" and \\"Galapagos.\\"  Yet \\"Mellon Collie\\" also has its fair share of filler--ther are at least 10 or so songs here that, if excised, would not detract from the album's mood.  Overall, I would say that I prefer the second disc over the first, since it's more melodic and subtle; the whole package would have been better as one disc, a la \\"Siamese Dream.\\"
B000065U1N|4.0|I've never really enjoyed war movies. Judging by my rating, however, you can tell that I liked this one. Some reviewers have complained about the length of the battles and the \\"blood and gore.\\" Um, yeah. This is a war movie. War involves long battles and  \\"blood and gore.\\" The battle sequences were long, but I think that the length helps set the mood. You get exhausted from it, as the soldiers must have been as well. We only watch an hour of battles; they lived a whole night of them.<BR> <br />As others have pointed out, the movie sticks to the events; Ridley Scott doesn't create a soap opera out of death.<br />It's a very beautiful and visually inspiring film. It also inspired me. I've had a low opinion of the military, but this film...I don't know how to describe it, but this film gave me a new view of what it is to serve. Because of this film I have incredible respect for those who serve.<br />A great film. Go see it (but don't bring the kids).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|i repeat: BEST MOVIE EVER.
B000001ES9|1.0|Firstly I am a huge Rush fan , I love nearly everything they do<BR>but this is bad , first album or not its a clunker.<BR>Theres nothing about this I like, and if Peart had been around<BR>at the time I`m sure things would have been different.<BR>Rush are a progressive rock band not a LZ clone act.<BR>Stay away , keep clear, avoid this at all costs<BR>and if anyone trys to tell you its good, try not to laugh<BR>yes it is that bad its almost funny.
0440219078|3.0|I read this book about a year ago and I thought it was good. I thought it was very interesting to see what the author thought the future could be like (for instance how the married couples are assigned to each other by their interests instead of falling in love). I liked the small twist at the end and would recomend this book for people who like science ficton as well as anyone who enjoys an easy-to-read and interesting book.
1565847032|5.0|This is Chomsky's best book, I think. It has the level of analytical detail of &quot;Year 501&quot; (for example), while keeping the accessibility of the Barsamian interview books. The editor (Peter Mitchell) has done a great job.<br />Perhaps a first-time reader of Chomsky should start with a different book, but for anyone who has read him already this is great stuff. Chomsky's replies to the questions posed to him move from general points to specific historical details with a peerless level of skill. Even if you have read already Chomsky on those some of these same topics, the depth of this book is amazing.
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this CD about 6 months ago. I usually try not to buy a CD unless i know of 3 songs that I like that will be on it. That is why I bought this CD and, still, I can listen to almost the whole thing. Each song has it's own beat or guitar riff that makes it unique, although sometimes it was hard to remember which song had which specific tune because they all sound a little bit alike. In conclusion, despite it's small downfalls, this is probably in the top 2 or 3 favorite CD's that I have and Linkin Park is now one of my favorite bands. I definately recomend this CD to anyone who likes hard rock.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is a great buy. Not only do you get one of the funniest movies ever, but you get so many fun DVD extras.  Michael Palin and Terry Jones take you to Doune castle to show you how they used one castle for half the movie, you can see how many roles each of the members of Monty Python play, sing along with Camelot, or my personal favorite, see Camelot done in Lego animation! I would highly recommend this to any Python fanatic, or anyone who loves to laugh!
B000021YQV|4.0|SOAD is definitely different from most of the popular metal acts these days, but you probably know that if you already have their first album.  The best song is Science, other highlights are Aerials, Prison Song, and Chop Suey.  Other songs are also good, with the exception of Psycho and Shimmy which may be good live, but are pretty boring on the album.  Its worthy.
B00004RF9I|5.0|Howard Beale, the enlightened news anchor explains:  Network is about the use of TV as the opiate of capitalistic society.  As long as the masses are passified by TV they'll only focus on what they're fed.  Meanwhile the corporate elite monopolize the markets while the government serves their interests at the expense of the middle class.  The lonely society's main social relationship is with their TVs and become interested in TVs feel good sensationalized distractions and their only purpose.. make the rich richer through their labor and purchases.  <BR>  Network asks the audience, &quot;Can we turn off our TV and stand up for our rights?&quot;  &quot;Are we too far gone?&quot;  Would a media mogul (like Rupert Murdoch of FOX) permit it?  2002 Network reality emphatically answers - we can not be saved!

B000056N8X|4.0|Endgame is the best sequel ever made for the Highlander series.  Highlander 2 Renegade Version was better than the theatrical, Highlander 3 has no hope (except for Debra Unger), Highlander Endgame was great....IN THEATERS!  This DVD version screwed up the mood of the film.  The added scenes are pointless and boring.  The new ending was impossible and happy (with sad music)!  The theatrical edit was the best thing to happen to this film, whoever did it should be commended (just look on disc 2 of the DVD on how bad this movie could have been!).<BR>I enjoyed the theatrical version, and so far, you cannot purchase it.  For those of you who never saw the movie in theatres, you will think this is a bad film.  Trust me, it was better.
6305882592|5.0|I am not a movie buff or a great connoisseur of movies - I occasionally watch movies here and there. Once in a while I come across a movie, which touches me, and make me think about that movie again and again - Harold and Maud is one such movie. It is a movie with a difference for the fact that the story is somewhat bizarre. This is a love story between a rich young man (Bud Cort) in his twenties and a poor old lady (Ruth Gordon) in her eighties. Once you start watching the movie you will definitely finish it before you can do anything else.  Ruth Gordon is just amazing and will not bore you for a second. Actually after watching this movie you start rethinking about your own old age and how you would like to spend it. This movie may change the philosophy of living.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Yes, it may be a cheesy love story but it has a great story to tell.  I loved it, when I went into the theaters to hate it.  I love the story of Pearl Harbor and Michael Bay did a great job of recreating the 1940's.  Yes, it is meant for todays audiences, but so is Titanic.  See this film, the R rated directors cut has more gore, only one added scene was appreciated...that's it.<BR>3 hours, enjoy the sound and score.
B00005B4GU|5.0|although not as great as kid a (probably radiohead's best), this album is another testament to the fact that radiohead is the best band out there. what seperates kid a from this album, in terms of quality is the formers cohesiveness. many state that these albums are inaccesable and boring. i don't agree at all, i for one loved them both from the first go. they are cold and distant, but one can't help but be captured by their mysterious beauty.<br />the highlight of the album for me is spinning plates (surely one of radioheads greatest accomplishments). i read in an interview that thom yorke described it as his fav. and it is odd to me that no one else seems to notice it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|SHREK is one of those movies that when you first see it amazing you on many levels. From the kids point of view it has characters and color and action and lot of slapstick cartoon humor. For the adults it has innuendos and under tones and a lot of intellectual humor. The subtleties of the dialogue and action of our main characters cannot really be appreciated until you have seen this movie more than once.<br />The story is great. There is an ogar named Shrek who wants to be left alone in his area of the forest. Due to an egocentric and selfish `shot-sighted' king - ruler, Shrek is invaded by all the old fairytale character every created by the Brothers Grimm and all the other fairytales we grew up with and loved. From snow white to Peter Pan, Robin Hood, Goldilocks, the Gingerbread Man, the Magic Mirror, Pinocchio and a talking Donkey. A talking Donkey you say...hence the adventure begins.<br />From this point forward the two opposites (Shrek and the Donkey) must convince the king to get rid of tall the fairytale characters but they found out there is a price.  They must rescue a princess from a mean dragon.<br />The movie is best represented by the talents of Mike Meyers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (The Donkey), John Lithgow (The King to be) and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona - these are the people that make this humorous and touching.<br />The DVD extras a really great. A bunch of stuff for the kids but for the adult there is the documentaries and the detailing of the computer animation process. Extremely detailed and hours of things to see and watch. I would recommend this for every family. Have fun. 8-20-02
0316666343|4.0|I loved the book, hated the hype. I know it can't be helped but I'm always afraid of people who thrust Bridges of Madison County at me and told me, with tears in their eyes, that it would CHANGE MY LIFE...okay, it did not. End of that subject.<BR>But it seemed like LB would appeal to those same readers. <BR>So I quickly bought LB as soon as I saw the hype begin. It was a wondeful first novel by a talented writer. Her heaven sounds good enough to me that I might have to reconsider my whole &quot;heaven&quot; thing. Besides, she put dogs in her heaven so the book got an automatic 3 stars just for that.<BR>Susie, the murdered girl narrator is believable and without a shred of self pity or angst. Her story unfolds much like you would expect it to as she describes the aftermath of disaster. I loved the grandma, was puzzled by the mother and thought she captured the sister, brother and murderer very well. I was glad she didn't go into any kind of poor murderer he had a terrible life, thing. Ya gotta figure he did. And I'm glad she stuck it to him in the end...<BR>She really captured my interest with her portrayal of the father and I was touched by his travels through grief, despair, revenge and losses...<BR>Enjoy the book. It's well under the hype radar but well worth it as a good read.
B0000025T6|4.0|This album, considere an essential recording in every specialized piece of rock midia, never really take off. But it was not written with the purpose to take off. Otherwise Bruce would not record it with only his vocals, one acustic guitar and some harmonica!!!<br />ATLANTIC CITY is by far the best song on it. The others are, at their best, average. But the mood os the record does the trick: its atmosphere is intense, depressing, hard to bear.<br />oNE of The Boss´s best records,because it is simply unique in his catalogue.
B000000WCA|3.0|Im sorry But this album deserves at least 2.5. Come on First of all this album isnt suppsoed to be taken seriously. the reason why I give such acts Like Britney Spears or NSYNC low points is because their music is boring , bland the same terribble voices and lyrics. With the Spice girls well they are totally manufactured and yes . This is bubblegum pop. But you cant say that you didnt find it fun to listen to some of the songs on this album cause I mean Wannabe. It was a hit it topped the charts in 33 countries and yes everybody listened, even they who hated the Spice Girls. This Album isnt one of my fabourites and indeed isnt really good but when this album was released in late 1996 almost everybody were buying. This Album sold 30 milion copies worldwide and yes made real music fans throw up and little girls party. But the whole thing with the Spice Girls is such a joke that I feel indeed sorry for them so I give them 3 stars.
B000002IHU|1.0|Hair bands were a disgrace to rock and metal, and RATT was one of the worst of them. Just seeing the way these guys. used to dress made me wanna vomit. <br />Ratt had some talent (guitarrist Warren De MArtini was really gifted, but the songs were just straight ahead glam of the worst kind!!
B000002KGT|3.0|Ok. I Must Say I wasnt born when this LP was released. I was born 8 years later but I do have taste for all kinds of music from 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s. All genres. this LP does not rank to my top 40 list as the best album that I own and why. Well . There are good songs on this album but there are also very weak ones as well. The version that I have is the regular normal audio cd version which is the only available on cd except for the dvd and why not release a digitally remastered. Anyway. I have to say that this LP contains at least 4 fillers and some of the songs arent that good. Rumours is not one of my favourite albums and I think it is very overrated judging by reviews and critics. It yes sold over 30 milion copies wordlwide. but Does it say that the LP is good. Well it is both critically and commercially alcaim And I do not want to start with Rolling Stone magazine which gave this album 5 stars out of 5 come on. This is my opinion many will disagree with me but Im allowed to express my opinion and indeed I have listened to a lot better albums than this.
B00005NGZX|5.0|Reviewing this cd is pointless. If you like METALCORE, you will not find a better Cd than this in the world.IT WILL KILL YOU WITHIN THE FIRST 10 SECONDS!!
B00000JGHM|5.0|Al Pacino versus Robert De Niro.  Al Pacino is the good cop with a Type A personality (which will come in handy when dealing with De Niro's character).  It's the classic good vs. bad movie.  If you are a fan of De Niro, THIS is probably one of his best un-sung movies of all time.  I almost missed this gem due to the lack of publicity! When looking over DVDs on Amazon, have you ever wondered what movie you simply missed?  Is there a great movie that you should have seen by now?  THIS IS IT!  The only other movie that I feel comes close to this showcase of sheer talent is Mr. De Niro's masterpiece, \\"A Bronx Tale\\".<br /> If I could afford it, I'd package these two titles to each new DVD that is purchased in the US.  A MUST HAVE!
B00004T9VY|5.0|I'm not even much of a Cat Stevens fan, but great music transcends all.  This is an essential recording in any music-lovers' collection.<br />My personal favorite, and what I think is Cat Stevens' greatest song, is \\"On the Road to Find Out\\". Incredibly, it does not even appear in the \\"Best Of\\" collection, which I would avoid since it's mostly filled with mediocre tunes.<br />Also excellent, and almost on par with \\"On the Road...\\" are \\"Where do the Children Play?\\", \\"Hard Headed Woman\\", \\"Wild World\\", and \\"Sad Lisa\\". These are the first four songs on the album - what a start! <br />Very solid, and great contributions of which any artist would be proud, are \\"Miles from Nowhere\\", \\"Longer Boats\\", \\"Into White\\", and \\"Father and Son\\".<br />\\"But I Might Die Tonight\\" and \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" are fillers.  Just my humble opinion, of course!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is no typical girl from Napanee Canada. She has a hit selling single, and album. I love all of her songs. She writes really good songs, and writes about what she feels and dose't care what other people think.<br />Loosing Grip- Great opener song. 5/5<br />Complicated- The song that hot her started. 5/5<br />Sk8er Boi- Great story song. People could really relate to this song. 5/5<br />I'm With You- Great slow song. 5/5<br />Mobile- Another great song. 5/5<br />Unwanted- A powerful song about being unwanted. 5/5<br />Tomorrow- Great song. This is one of her best ballads. 5/5<br />Anything But Ordinary- Great song. She really can sing. 5/5<br />Thing's I'll Never Say- Sounds like a popish song. 5/5<br />My World- Excellent song about her life. 5/5<br />Nobody's Fool- Gives a great message to be yourself. 5/5<br />Too Much To Ask For- Avril shows off her wrtiing skills. 5/5<br />Naked- Great song. 5/5<br />I think this is a great album. Can't wait to see what Avril has in store for us when her new album comes out.
B000002J2B|4.0|This is a really good cd. Two best songs are One for the Vine, I think it must be a song about a failed military campaign, one of genesis best songs. The next best song is Blood on the rooftops just fro the fact that I like that the classic accoustic guitar into so well. All the songs are good. You're own special way gave genesis some air play in the U.S for the first time.

Hope you enjoy!!!
0452282152|5.0|This was a wonderful read.  Chevalier transports the reader to 17th century Holland, and brings a work of art to life.  I had to keep reminding myself that this was fiction, rather than a historical biography.Girl With a Pearl Earring is the story of the young Griet, who becomes a servant in the home of the famous Johannes Vermeer. While Griet is championed, readers will also sympathize with each of the other characters, among them her impoverished parents, Mrs.Vermeer and her children, Griet's brother, and Vermeer himself.  Chevalier's research of the geography and time period of which she writes is thorough. The story is realistic, helping readers to understand the setting in which Vermeer worked.    <BR>When the book is finished, there is the feeling that the story is not.  As in many great books, readers feel that although they are privy to much, there is so much more that could have been written.  This was a novel (no pun intended) way in which to further the cause of appreciating art, both painted and written.
B00005U1YO|4.0|We've all heard &quot;that one song&quot;- you know, the one song that a group produces that sounds really unusual, that works in a way that none of their other recordings before or since ever could.  One of those for me is Prodigy's &quot;Mindfields,&quot; or Beethoven's first piano concerto.  (In all fairness, everything by Beethoven has that feel, but that's beside the point.)  If I had had to pick one from the Chemical Brothers' repertoire, it would have been either &quot;Block Rockin' Beats&quot; or &quot;Music: Response,&quot; the latter having been my introduction to their work.  At this point, I'm a little shaky on that standing: &quot;Come with Us&quot; is an entire collection of &quot;one songs.&quot;  Though its style is decidedly dance-ish, it is typical of the Brothers' ethic: give the listener the feeling of being overwhelmed by sound.  They aren't minimalists by any means, and &quot;Come with Us&quot; is a thickly populated soundscape.  While the sound isn't necessarily cutting-edge, it IS the work of experienced hands. These are two artists who know what they're doing, and they're doing it very well.
0393314804|5.0|well its just facking brilliant, i'n't it.
B0000640VN|4.0|I loved this movie! I rented this movie last week and was very pleased. I am a Meg Ryan fan and definitely became a fan of Hugh Jackman! I went right out and bought the DVD that weekend. I watched the Original version and the Director's Cut. The Director's Cut is definitely better. It adds more history to Kate's character and helps the story flow more smoothly. The character of Leopold, Duke of Albany is excellently played by Hugh Jackman. Meg Ryan was her same cutsy self with a layered mop hairdo. However, this wasn't one of her best movies. Liev Schreiber and Breckin Meyers were also excellent in their roles. Breckin was really funny when his character &quot;Charlie&quot; was &quot;in the zone&quot; with his favorite girl and his replaying of Leopold's conversation about the Louvre. I think that is when Leopold realizes that he is falling for Kate. I love the scene where Leopold is sitting next to Kate in the restaurant and corrects J.J. on the location of his English home, the opera's characters and his view of J.J.'s trying to seduce Kate. My favorite scenes were Leopold's rescuing of Kate at Central Park; the rooftop dinner and dancing; the following morning when he made breakfast and the dishwasher lesson; the finding of his uncle's house; the evening listening to the soundtrack of &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; and his tucking in and snuggling with Kate. Did you notice when Leopold called Kate &quot;Your Grace&quot;? I particulary like the part where Kate realized that she really loved Leopold and was willing to take that &quot;leap of faith&quot; off the Brooklyn Bridge to be with Leopold, because it meant that she was willing to leave her family and career to find love and happiness with somebody that treated her with love and respect. Who in their right mind would turn away from that? (I certainly didn't when I moved from CA to NJ to be with the man I loved.) I wish that when Kate and Leopold were dancing after Leopold announced his bride, the script could have gone further with the culture shocks that Kate would have experienced in the late 1800's. Then of course, that's the perfect excuse for a sequel! Overall, this movie was lovely and it became one of my favorite movies. I am sure that I will watch this many times over. This movie makes you want to travel time to find your own duke!
B000002J20|4.0|This may sound strange to you, but I bought this album about 15 years ago, listened to it a few times, found it inaccessible, and set it aside.  Just recently, I decided to give it another chance.  I commute 40 minutes to work and figured I could listen on the way, and back.  <br />This is not an album that comes easily, but after listening to it about 5 or so times, it is starting to come together, and I do like it.  I don't think it is quite the work of art of &quot;close to the edge&quot; or &quot;relayer&quot;. At times it just seems to be thrown together--as if the band was in a garage somewhere and just improvised.  The sound quality also doesn't seem as clear and crisp as on some of their other works.<br />I agree with the other reviewers that this should not be your first YES purchase, but if you get hooked into them, as I have, you will find some juicy tidbits here.
B00004ZESV|4.0|Many fans who already own the VHS version of this concert may be delighted as I was by the inclusion of several new songs. The real gem among these is a terrific version of &quot;Say Hey&quot; by the incredibly energetic Andy Hernandez--a true funk classic which alone makes this DVD worth the purchase.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has come a long way in the past four years. In this album, Britney portrays a \\"No forgiveness\\" type of girl. It's great, I can't stop listening to her songs!!! The style of songs in this album in my opinion is much better than the other two, although \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" had some good songs, most of them appeared to be fillers to me.<br />I'm A Slave 4 U - 8/10 It's not that great when you first listen to it, but it really grows on you. It just makes you want to dance, with it's funky beats and sexy lyrics. The video is a little too nasty though.<BR>Overprotected - 9/10 This song never get's old. The chorus is great, along with the third \\"verse\\". The instrumental version of this is great too, although I must say, the Dark Child remix is MUCH BETTER. That song is one of her best ever<BR>Lonely - 10/10 This song is great, the guitar really helps out. The chorus is a great yell out type of thing, while the verses are cool with their quiet whispery qualities. It couldn't be improved any bit at all.<BR>I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - 7/10 She has had better ballads, with better lyrics, while this isn't bad, it's not great either.<BR>Boys - 8/10 It's a good song, but yet again, not great. It's really funky, but the music is repetitive until the last parts of the song. The Co-Ed Remix is MUCH better and get's a 10/10<BR>Anticipating - 8/10 This song made me cringe at first, but it really grows on you. The music is too happy at first, but it get's much better later on. the lyrics kinda er....suck.<BR>I Love Rock 'N' Roll - 6/10 I don't really like this song much, I loved it at first though. It gets kinda stale, just like all the covers Britney did...but it's the best cover so far.<BR>Cinderella - 7/10 It's not that great, the music is really good, but I don't know...the style is.....I don't know. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, I just don't like it much<BR>Let Me Be - 9/10 It's not good when you first listen to it, but it grows on you big time. The unique instruments in the background are really fitting for the song, and it creates a peaceful melodic work of art.<BR>Bombastic Love - 10/10 This song is genius, I love it. It is so new and different. The opening is just plain amazing, I have no idea what synth effect that is, but it is amazing. The first line is so magical too \\"I, I'm here to testify\\". Amazing.<BR>That's Where You Take Me - 7/10 It's not that great... I mean I'm sure a lot of people like it, I just happen not to<BR>What It's Like To Be Me - 1000000/10 This song is simply amazing, I love it, it's always on. I can't stop listening to it, I just wish they would have made it longer, say 3:30...it's way to short, comming in at 2:50<BR>When I Found You - 9/10 Very different indeed. I like it a lot, it's a good sort of ballad. It's actually kind of addicting...<BR>Before The Goodbye - 10/10 An AMAZING song. It's undescribable.<br />Songs not featured on \\"Britney\\", yet often credited to it<br />I Run Away - 10/10 Amazing ballad, with great synth affects, and an occasional violen! It's a great song, if only it was on a CD...<BR>Intimidated - 9/10 Great techno-ish song. Also, I wish it was on a CD<BR>She'll Never Be Me - 15/10 GREAT SONG! I can't WAIT for the full version! Great download song, you'll be addicted to all 1:13 of it....<br />But Britney! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
0380715430|4.0|I'm an inveterate word lover, so learning some interesting background on English made The Mother Tongue an obvious reading choice.  Add to that, my devotion to Bill Bryson books, and it was a match made in book heaven.<br />Still, like all assumed things, it wasn't a perfect arrangement - the first chapter began with some references that instantly dated the work - namely, the former Soviet Union, which was still very much in existence when this was written.  It sort of put a damper on my enthusiasm.  Still, I found plenty to keep me engrossed and the book never left my side once I began it.<br />Bryson does his research - this is clear in all his other works as well - but something that is as scholarly as the English language, needs a steadier hand with things that are open to interpretation.  Personally, I enjoyed the random trivia and digressions, but that style may not appeal to all.  <br />If you like Bryson, like languages, and have a good sense of humor, The Mother Tongue is a worthwhile read.  I recommend it.
0767827791|5.0|More character study then narrative, the whole film is set during a picnic that takes place the day after a drifter comes to town ready to begin again (but with some some problems on starting at the bottom).<br />Although some people criticize the cast, all I can say is that I find Holden and Novak's performance trully magnetic. It's true that Holden was old, but it doesn't change the fact that he was great (and to be honest, I find it difficult to imagine a younger actor in such a dense role). Rosalind Russell's top performance is also something to be seen (on the subplot) as a woman who's so desperate to grab her last chance to get married that she ruins it (or not?).<br />The scene where the two leads dance by the river lit with chinese ballons is beautifully staged, shot, photographed and editted. An absolute must in the 50's Cinema.<br />The DVD comes with two sides: one for widescreen, the other for standard version. Compare the two and you'll see the superiority of widescreen over standard. Standard is horribly crippled.<br />The sound is full mono (I which it was recorded in stereo...) and the jazzy soundtrack is peerless.<br />Obviously, most of the issues are much dated by now (virginity, drinking, ageing, marrying, not marrying, etc.), but it was made in the fifties - what did you expect. And yet, I see it very darring in many ways.<br />Great performances.<br />Worth watching. Worth buying.
076790382X|5.0|*A little warning: Bill Bryson, whom fans saw waving good-bye to jolly England in his last book (Notes from a Small Island), is found here in lovely little Hanover in the New Hampshire mountains.  I have inordinate fondness for Hanover, having spent my undergrad years there, so I am both very familiar and very biased here.  I am also inordinately fond of Bryson (who I saw once sitting at our local pub) as a smart, witty, keen-eyed writer.  Stranger gives you plenty to think and laugh about (sometimes simultaneously).  I can't recommend him enough!  I never travel without a Bryson book with me.*<br />After spending almost all of his adult life in Great Britain, Bryson has to relearn those fun experiences like mortgages, neighbors, and raising kids, American-style.  From spackle to post offices, from haircuts to the lost art of walking, the little things in life are highlighted and inspected in Bryson's funny, funny way.  He is sarcastic and befuddled by turns, but with the wry humor of a man who knows life is messy and complicated, but grand all the same.  He makes the most of his surroundings and modern America.<br />The chapters are actual columns that originally ran in a British newspaper, so they are somewhat tailored to that audience.  Of course, this means there are a few \\"explanations\\" of American customs, but hardly anything to get upset over as some reviewers have.  Bryson speaks of his own perceptions of his own experiences, not so criminal in a memoir.  And it is quite clear that he enjoys life in the US - strange as it is for him at times, which is what makes the book hilarious.  Check out his thoughts on taxes, computer tech support, death statistics, and America's car dependency.  Not to mention the general theme of a very confused middle-aged man trying to get back in sync with the country he grew up in.<br />Bryson has mellowed gradually, with each of his books.  Here he is wonderfully human - a happy family man, an earnest citizen, an ardent observerlooking at America from a unique perspective.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at how it will make you appreciate, or at least consider, the little things we Americans take for granted.  A fine, intelligent work that will have you entertained from cover to cover.
0783244320|5.0|This is a great DVD, it's just a hilarious film full of the best Star Trek send-ups and just a great way to spend your time. Looks like the actors had fun making it. A+ family comedy.
6300185249|4.0|Totally wacky 80's flick, starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. This, and Bringing Up Baby, are the two films I turn to when I need a serious pick-me-up. It's nice to know that no \\"bad\\" day can ever be as bad as theirs!<br />All sorts of bizarre, hilarious things happen when Hanks and Long decide to bite the bullet and join the ranks of homeowners. Too bad their house begins falling apart the moment they buy it.<br />Key moments:<BR>the staircase<BR>the black hole in the study<BR>the contractors<BR>the kitchen<br />It's rather dated, as all 80's things are, but well worth a look. In this slapsticky version of Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, Hanks plays one of his trademark roles - the bewildered man fruitlessly trying to make sense of his mad, mad world. It's laugh-out-loud funny no matter how many times you see it.
B00005ARDC|5.0|These guys sound so much like Love and Rockets, it hurts. This is just a really great album that should appeal to any Love and Rockets fans or enthusiasts of late 60's psychedelic rock.  The tracks, 'White Palms' and 'Sure as the Sun' stand out as particularly L&amp;R styled songs, replete with hypnotic chords, Danniel Ash wah-wah guitar blitzing and fat, fuzzy, psychedelic bass. There is even what could be a cover of 'Dreamtime' stashed at the end of 'Sure as the Sun.' Seriously, if you've ever put 'Express' or 'Sweet FA' on repeat, buy this album immediately.<br />Like L&amp;R, they make one hell of a racket for 3 guys with guitar, bass and drum. Their sound is not entirely original, but so what. The music that they are making has been missing from college and mainstream pop for far too long. This is an album that makes me feel pretty good about the state of rock and roll for the first time in many years.
B00000099Y|5.0|They have progressed since their excellent debut, Undertow in 1993, and it shows. The guitar playing and drumming becomes a lot more complex and steering away from traditional metal. The newly recruited bassist Justin Chancellor completely serves the music more justice than Paul D'Amour, not to insult him. <BR><BR>This CD is.. different. They experiment more with Revolution 9/Merzbow-like sound collages, such as Cesaro Summability and (-)ions, and music that's just weird, especially the belligerent &quot;Message To Harry Manback,&quot; which contains one of the prettiest piano melodies known to man with some guy cursing about this guy he hates (he sounds like a mixture between Arabic and Puerto Rican).<BR><BR>As for the songs, they're pretty long. But Tool made sure of one thing; they made their music effective, unlike bands like Dream Theater and Symphony X who just mkae long progressive songs for the sake of it. And Maynard's vocals/lyrics are almost untouchable. Actually seeing him on stage was unreal because he was so enigmatic. He commanded the stage without really trying. <BR><BR>Tool is a band you can't pin down with a label. People call them 'metal,' some 'art-rock,' some 'alternative,' but they just can't be boiled down to one genre. And they don't care about the mainstream at all. They just let the music speak for itself.
0684852756|4.0|Hanif Kureishi has managed to pack more honesty, pain, and intimacy into this small, 120 page novel than any author I have read.  It's brutally honest as well as heartbreaking, and captures the feelings of many people who are in relationships and struggling to stay together in our modern times.  Hanif vividly describes the fears, desires and challenges a man must face when he decides one night to leave his wife and two children, as he feels there is no more passion left in their relationship.  Is he making the right decision?  How will it effect his wife and children?  The fears and challenges the whole family faces, and how it all turns out, is surely an emotional read, and a lesson for anyone going through similar problems in a relationship.<BR>  <br />This is a great follow-up story from the author who wrote \\"MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE\\" and \\"THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA\\", and should not be missed.  Although I found myself reading way past the midnight hour, it was worth it.  This is a book I will always remember.<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen
B00004YRQA|5.0|First, If u plan to go online, this is the only memory card u should buy. I HEARD from a magazine that it protects from hackers with a special chip. THIS SUCKS, NOW WE HAVE TO PROTECT OURSELVES AGAIN COMPUTER HACKERS, AND PS2 HACKERS???Still, if u dont plan to go online, still buy this memory card. For one, its the official memory card of the ps2, which means taht it was manufactured by the same company. (duh) And, u never know, you might HAVE to go online sometime... so this is just a good memory card to have...
B000002JS0|5.0|A great CD. I bought it about a week ago and I love it. Bon Scott is great on this one with The Jack, T.N.T, Little Lover, High Voltage, Live Wire, and more. You will get what you payed for. Trust me, I know I sure did!
B00003CX96|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring and best-told tales of growing up in small-town, USA.  Solid acting, an incredibly entertaining and fun storyline, and great charaters.  Though it's not just about biking, this movie is able to somehow capture the joy of biking - the thrill of self-propelling oneself over the concrete and through the air on a simple, silent machine you hard even know is there.<br /><br />Definitely a must-see for any film fan.  A real crowd-pleasure, too.  Good for everyone in the family, maybe like one swear word and no violence to speak of.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00005QXDD|5.0|This album is hilarious and the music is excellant.  A truly great album that you will enjoy over and over.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I've been aware of Interpol since the end of last year but hadn't bother to pick up any of their EPs. I happened to get ahold of the songs from \\"Turn On the Bright Lights\\" a few weeks before it came out and was quickly hooked. <br />Interpol draws comparisons to numerous classic bands. Particularly Joy Division. To me their sound is screams \\"New York\\", but that is not a bad thing. They've got a little bit of Television and little bit of Talking Heads. You can throw them in the same vein as the Strokes except that Interpol has greater range. In essence I hear a lot of different reminiscient textures on this record. There's a lot of straightfoward punk in their sound as well. <br />All in all its just fantastic rock n' roll. Its got style, substance and depth. Eleven songs and no throwaways. I guarantee this will be showing up on everyone's end of year top ten lists. It certainly will be on mine.
B0000640VO|5.0|Starring Audrey Tautou as Amelie, this wonderfully executed emotional comedy will keep the interest of even the worst ADD sufferer. Although the dialogue is in Parisian French with English subtitles, this doesn't detract from the viewing experience like it does in some other foreign films.<br />Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and costarring Dominique Pinon (you'll see the same credits -- directed by and costarring -- in the wonderful French film &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and the American film &quot;Alien: Resurrection&quot;), &quot;Amelie&quot; was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Film. From her childhood and the comedic horror it wrought with a suicidal pet fish and the very unusual demise of her mother to her newfound purpose in life to help complete strangers this is a feel-good comedy full of surprises and wonderful visual effects. Amelie is kind of like Ally McBeal, without all the whining and self-pity. She has a very healthy imagination and sometimes retreats into it, but not to the point that she ignores the real world. In fact, she most often affects the real world using her imagination. She is not self-concious or shy, except when it comes to going after her own dreams. Watch as she struggles to decide whether to pursue her own desires or continue to do only for others.
B000003TA4|5.0|Ok I've only ever listened to Lithium and Smells Like Teen Spirit but I can say they are like two of my favorite songs in the world. Plus most 13 year olds don't even know who Nirvana is so you have to give me props there. And earlier today the baby on the cover was on who knows the band and he's 10 now so that was pretty entertianing. Well that's about it. Buy this CD.
B00000255F|5.0|BORN TO RUN may be the perfect rock recording. From the opening piano/harmonica and the wonderful imagery of &quot;Thunder Road&quot; (&quot;The screen door slams/Mary's dress waves/Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays...&quot; You can just picture it.)to the epic strife of &quot;Jungleland&quot; (&quot;And the poet's down here/Don't write  nothing at all/They just stand back and let it all be&quot;)Springsteen and the E-street band are in perfect sync. From beginning to end each song plays with no loss of energy or emotional resonance. Repeated listenings let new discoveries arrive, like Roy Bittan's wondrous piano work that stands out as it supports, giving each song depth, or Clarence Clemons's sax, crying out in the darkness or singing joyfully into the light. This one is simply a classic. It just doesn't get any better than this.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I went to the theater expecting as usual a bad movie for a good game will it was nothing as i expected, It was just Splashing active bloody movie, I was thrilled from the story the visual effects & sound effects, I mean you are on your feet tell the end of the movie it's a different story to the usual resident evil problem...!!!<BR> I won't say anything about the movie but it's a good one, so if you like action, science fiction, and real horror just see it.!
0316666343|5.0|A tender, sweet book! Given the subject mattter and point of view, it could easily have been a depressing story but it was not. And I found Ms. Sebold's concept of heaven to be very comforting.<br />I have started passing my copy around but have made it clear that I want it back - I plan to read it again.
B000069HKH|5.0|Throughout his storied career, Bruce Springsteen has written songs about everyday men and women and how they dealt with life's many difficulties (most of which he attributes to Reaganomics - which I agree with).<br />This album is no different, except his songs now offer hope, inspiration and strength to those affected by September 11th and other tragedies.<br />There is not a single bad (not even a below average) song on the album.  From moving ballads to rockin' anthems to a middle eastern inspired love song, it is all here.  And it is all good.<br />One more thing -  Some reviewers have criticized Bruce for &quot;cashing in on Sept 11th&quot;.  This is such a blantant mistake and lie.  Springsteen's home county (in New Jersey) lost 158 men and women on that day, and many survivers and family members have asked him to play for them as a way to deal with and began the healing.  Also, this album has almost no direct references to Sept 11th allowing it to stand on its own, separate from that tragic day.<br />I can't recommend anything more highly
B00003CX8J|2.0|Ok I'm a big huge x-men fan... but please gimme a break.<br />Storm... I know there was a Storm in this movie... but where was the Storm I know of? It certainly wasn't the simpering scared girl depicted here.<BR>And the mix was terrible... Old x-men with New x-men with young x-men all at the same time... <br />I still watch the movie a lot the special effects were great!
0312265859|5.0|I have loved reading all of the Stephanie Plum books.  These are the only books that I've read that I actually laugh out loud because they are so funny.  I thought this was an excellent book and was disappointed when I finished because I have to wait another whole year for a new book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|BOB is the greatest piece of historical entertainment I have ever seen.
0786860707|5.0|If you can only afford one book on animation, this is the book to own. It's a wonderful &quot;oversized&quot; high quality hardcover full of illustrations and wisdom that I feel are priceless. If you take just one bit of wisdom from this volume, it will have paid for itself. Every time I open it, it's as if I had one of the Disney masters sitting next to me. The principles discussed are a distillation of wisdom over many years from one of the premiere animation pioneers and will provide an excellent foundation as you explore the wonders of this art. I've paid much more for other books, which didn't even come close to the content in this one. It's really a treasure that you will reference time and time again even at twice the price!
B0000640VN|5.0|I'm not really big on time-travel romances, but this movie is a real exception to the rule.  I won't dwell on all of the particulars that make the time-travel possible; they are really secondary to the plot.  However, what is really wonderful is the juxtaposition of modern mores and &quot;old-fashioned&quot; social behaviors as Leopold learns to maneuver in the present day.  Many of my friends have said that they would love to find a man who behaves like Leopold ... with genuine consideration for others.
B00003CXDD|3.0|Many claim 'Willow' bears uncanny resemblances to Lord of the Rings and Star Wars (Madmartigan is Han Solo with a sword instead of a gun, and the short, pastorial, innocent Nelwyns are highly reminisent of the Shire-dwelling Hobbits). Though this is true, both Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are good books/movies - thus reason dictates that 'Willow' is too! People of all ages should enjoy this movie, centred on the universal theme that just one person can make a difference, and filled with adventure, romance, comedy, danger and intrigue.<BR>The story is centred around a baby rather than a Ring, and the infant is not to be destroyed, but saved at all costs. The reason is that this child - Elora Danan - is prophesied to bring about the downfall of the tyrannical Queen Bavmorda (played to great effect by Jean Marsh). Through a series of fortunate events, Elora escapes the clutches of the Queen and comes to the Nelwyn village, a small community of tiny woodland folk, and the guardianship of the sorcerer wannabe - Willow Ufgood (played by Warwick Davis in perhaps the best role of his career - for once he's not hidden behind a mask or facial prosthetics!) Because the presence of the baby puts the community at risk, Willow is chosen to take the baby far away, into the care of the Dakini (or human) race. On the way, Willow has (inevitably) many amazing adventures with a series of diverse characters, learning not only of Elora's true destiny, but that even someone as small as he can have an impact on the world.<BR>The story, on the whole, hangs together well, although there is some back-and-forth travelling between the characters, and some logic flaws (ie. there's no way even a magical baby could survive even half the things that Elora does, and Sorsha is accepted without question into the ranks of the 'good guys').<BR>The movie makes up for these faults by presenting a wide range of interesting and well-portrayed characters that fit perfectly into the fanasty genre - no oneshould be disappointed by the variety, whether it be from the shape-changing enchantress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes), to the skeleton-masked Kael (Pat Roach), the etheral faerie Cherlindrea (Maria Holvoe) to the comic relief - the brownies Rool (Kevin Pollack) and Franjean (Rick Overton). Likewise, the scenery and sets are beautiful (Lord of the Rings wasn't the first to discover New Zealand!) and most of the special effects hold up reasonably well against today's technology. Furthermore, the musical score is lovely - both poignant and heroic, and the costumes are colourful but realistic.<BR>Although the love/hate romance between the stars of the movie (Val Kilmer as Madmortigan and Joanne Whalley as Bavmorda's daughter Sorsha) is a nice twist on the typical fairytale treatment, it could of been handled better, especially since the two actors fell in love on set (although they did later divorce...). Oh well, this is only a minor gripe, and by no means ruins the story.<BR>The major dampener is nothing to do with the movie, but with the DVD, as it does not include the vast majority of deleted scenes that were filmed but never shown. If you're interested, they include: scenes that deepen the friendship between Willow and Meegosh, and gives a legitimate reason as to why Meegosh would leave his friend (he breaks his arm when falling down the brownie pit); a run-in with a sea-monster when Willow rows out to Raziel's island; important background information on Sorsha, explaining that her father was the ruler of Tir Asleen and once in love with Raziel until Bavmorda placed him under a love spell before turning him to stone along with the rest of his kingdom; a large battle sequence between Airk and Kael's troops; banter between Kael and a captured Madmortigan; Sorsha calling Willow into her tent to tend for Elora where they discuss Madmortigan; Airk questioning Sorsha's sudden change from evil to good; and Sorsha actually *using* the quiver of arrows she carries around onher back for the entire movie. <BR>These deleted scenes could have made up a substantial part of the DVD and heightened it's collectibility considerably. Perhaps before buying this DVD we should wait a bit longer and see if they are released on another edition in the future.<BR>If you like the Willow movie and are interested in 'what happens next' - try tracking down the trilogy of books that are set after the events in 'Willow' - Shadow Moon, Shadow Dawn and Shadow Star.
0316666343|5.0|I purchased The Lovely Bones on a whim, and began to read it that evening. From the first word, the author had me hooked. The book is tragic, funny, and wonderfully written. There were passages that had me laughing out loud, and others that made me cry.<br />The idea that each person who passes on has their own heaven is just a wonderful idea. Take it from me, who has lost a few people over the years...the idea that they have their own heaven above is comforting to me. <br />Although the book, to me, was unresolved in a sense, it totally drew me in and kept me there, and left me wanting more. I can say it has been one of the best books I have ever read, and I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.<br />No mention of religion in this book, although heaven is talked about quite often.

0783225881|5.0|\\"If you build it, he will come\\" are the words heard by Ray( Kevin Costner) in the opening scene of Field of Dreams. A movie that if you love Baseball and the meaning of family, you have to see. It stars Kevin Costner, in his one of his best proformences, shows the comic and heartfelt emotion for which he is known. The movie it self is just magical in every sense of the word. It's a moving story told in a way that might surprise you( you will never look at corn the same way again). And their is a speech about Baseball, by James Earl Jones, that only he could have done. The movie also has Burt Lancaster's last proformance. My advice... just watch and get lost in a movie that will touch your heart and fill your soul. It is a great movie!!!!!
0553381709|5.0|I usually avoid fiction.  However, A Song of Fire and Ice,    (Books 1, 2, 3) was entertaining, exciting, and unpredictable. I found the characters to be well -developed and realistic.  It was easy to imagine that the locations were real, and the events plausible.<br />In my opinion, the last book, A Storm of Swords, was marvelous.  I think Mr. Martin is one of the most gifted writers currently publishing.  I am anxious to know <BR>when Book 4 will be released. I hope it is soon.  <br />I was unable to put these books down.  That has not happened since I read The Lord of the Rings.   I have had to read the first three a second time to keep the intricate subplots fresh.<BR>If Mr. Martin reads this, I hope he will be encouraged to tell us the rest of the story soon!<br />I did not find these books to be better or worse than the Lord of the Rings.  They were simply different.  Both are extremely well written with fantastic imagery, vivid characters, and logical plot development.  This particular trilogy will also become a classic.<br />These books were worth my time.  I always looked forward to turning the page!
B00005JKES|5.0|The first seven episodes of Twin Peaks accomplished what many shows can't do in their entire lifespan. The characters, whether it be the good-natured Agent Cooper, the seductive, beautiful Audrey Horne, or her dad, the conniving, manipulative Ben Horne, have such distinct personalities, it feels like you actually know them. Scenes like the amazing Red Room sequence in Episode 2 and Laura's funeral in Episode 3 are what all TV shows should strive to be like. The Red Room/Cooper's dream sequence in particular is one of the greatest moments in television history. By the end of Episode 7 (which leaves a daunting and daring cliffhanger), you'll never watch television quite the same way again; especially since a suprising amount of TV shows these days use themes and ideas that Twin Peaks exposed to the media.<br />The DVD release of this first season is perfect. The picture quality, as well as the sound quality, is definitely reference material for anyone thinking about buying a DVD player; the extras are very nice, including commentary by the directors of each episode (with the exception of Ep. 2 and 7, which were directed by Lynch and Frost, respectively; the director of photography gives commentary for these ones), introductions for each episode by the Log Lady, and much more. The only quibble I have for the DVD, like many others, is that the pilot episode is nowhere to be found. This is most likely because Artisan Entertainment couldn't acquire the rights to it; however, there are dozens of copies of an import, region-free DVD of the pilot episode on eBay for only 10 or 12 dollars. The quality isn't that great, but it's the only DVD out that has the original broadcast version of the pilot, until Paramount gets their act together and puts out a Region 1 release of it.<br />I can't wait until Season 2 comes out, although I've heard it won't until next year. Here's hoping the wait will be worth it.
B00006G8HX|4.0|It would be nice to know more about this \\"Special Edition\\" before pre-ordering it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the \\"Director's Edition's\\" of TMP and TWOK with re-editing, restored scenes, reworked effects, and commentary.  The addition of interviews and extras on the second DVD made them well worth purchasing.<br />I'm guessing that calling III a \\"Special Edition\\" means we will be seeing the same movie already commercially released on DVD with perhaps a director commentary and some interviews.  It would be nice to know for sure before ordering it, since the present description offers precious little detail.
0380977788|5.0|Neil Gaiman has shown as admirable knack for fiction for young adults and children as he has shown in adult fiction.  I am tempted to attribute this to his experience writing graphic stories, but it is really something more than that.  It is an ability to touch the sources of wonder and fear without the necessity of excessive gore and grimness.  Not that bad things don't happen in Gaiman's tales, but they tend to go right to the heart, instead of the stomach.<br />This tale is about a remarkable young woman named Coraline (who remains polite, even when you call her Caroline).  Recently she and her parents have moved into one of those wondrous old houses that are sometimes converted into flats.  Both Coraline's parents work at home, and sometimes she feels a bit ignored and bored.  Nevertheless, she is encouraged to explore and so she does.  First her neighbors.  The Misses Spink and Forcible are two retired thespians who live together in the bottom flat, and up above is Mr. Bobo, who is an avid trainer of mice.  Having run out of people, Coraline investigates the premises.  Her flat is most unusual; it has 21 windows and 14 doors.  Only one door is locked, and that only leads to a brick wall.<br />Well, most of the time it does.  On some occasions, it opens up on a world just like this one, where Coraline finds her other mother, other father, and even other neighbors.  At first it seems quite nice, people pay more attention to one there, the toys are better, and, of all things, the cat talks.  Soon Coraline finds all is not quite as it seems.  Everyone has buttons for eyes, her other mother has strange hands that seem to have a life of their own, and there are a remarkable number of rats.  In fact, if you dig deep enough, things are really most horrible.  Coraline has much to do to make things come around right.<br />With young people's fiction, adults are often driven to worry about what the stories teach and if they will have ill effects on their child.  Coraline's plight, being stranded away from her parents amidst a world full of thinly veiled threats may be uncomfortable for a sensitive child.  Yet things work out well in the end, and Coraline is an excellent role model, who understands what courage truly is and is in touch with what is really important to her.  Equally, this is a work of art and it is never too early to encourage children to develop a sense of what good writing really is.<br />Fortunately, this really is a book that an adult can enjoy as well.  And I can't help but think that it might stimulate some interesting family discussions.  I would recommend it to anyone who believes that children can benefit from new and unusual reading experiences.  I also should mention the delightful illustrations from the pen of Dave McKean, a long time designer and illustrator for Neil Gaiman's graphic work.s plight, being stranded away from her parents amidst a world full of thinly veiled threats may be uncomfortable for a sensitive child.

038533348X|5.0|There are two things I've discovered about Kurt Vonnegut.<BR>1) His books are ultimately depressing and cynical<BR>2) His story lines are incredibly interesting<br />This is the height of both.  It's a short, easy read.  It's totally absorbing and entertaining.  I think I discovered that I'm a Bokononist.  Too bad.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Let's put it this way... I now think we need instruments of mind control (a la 'brave new world') pumping subliminal messages into people's heads as they sleep.  And this album should be the message.  Utopia would be within our reach...
0064407667|2.0|This book was compared to the Harry Potter books in a famous entertainment magazine and I decided to purchase it since I loved the Harry Potter books.  I am not sure if the targetted age group for this book is the same as H.P., but it feels much more juvenile.  The author keeps interrupting the story to define words, which is highly annoying.  Also the characters are not very well developed and everything is very predictable.  It does not live up to the hype.  Check it out in a library before you spend your money on it.
6301972139|5.0|If any film can be close to history, this Moulin is one. This Moulin Rouge does require digitalization and restoration in the conversion to DVD, and all of this is possible. It would be wonderful if an accompanying DVD, \\"Making of Moulin Rouge\\" (1952)  be with the DVD release.   Many are not aware that in his role Ferrer demonstrates interesting things, i.e. how Lautrec produced his lithographs with the methods of the day with etched stones; how he splattered paint <BR> springing back the hair on a paint brush, etc. <BR> With all of the offered insights of the day, will the critics take Ferrer to task for walking on his knees, instead of surgically removing his legs ?<BR>  Consider the production, \\"Making of Lust for Life\\" which furnishes the background for the Kirk Douglas classic, and how and where it was filmed on actual locations in France.<BR> In the \\"Making of Lust for Life\\" Kirk Douglas speaks with living people who knew Van Gogh, and what a great experience.<BR> These four films represent a great period in art history, and artists, young and old, should be able to view these products in<BR>the best technology available; rather than relegating them to some dark film vault to be forgotten. These films are vibrant and alive.<BR> The contribution of these production outweighs the efforts of the \\"spoilers\\" who would very likely throw out the Mona Lisa as <BR> some smiling insignificant lady of the night. Those who dismiss the value of these art productions reflect the poverty of their cultural background, <BR> and anemia coursing their limited concepts.

B00005QG9J|5.0|this is, by far, the most musical of incubus' albums.  they have come a long way from fungus amongus, and there is so much variety on this cd, it's almost frightening.  frightening in a good way, though, kinda like frightening-first-drop-on-a-roller-coaster.  let's go through it track by track, like so many others, shall we?<br />1. nice to know you - what a wonderful song.  there's so much going on at the beginning, you can't listen to it once and say you've heard the whole song.  brandon's vocals on the chorus are amazing... that man has a range like no other.  if you don't like it the first time, listen to it a few more times, it grows on you.<br />2. circles - one of the more &quot;hard rock&quot; songs of the album.  pretty cool lyrics, the music's ok... i think my favorite part of the song is the part before the singing where there is a measure of 5/8 followed by a measure of 7/8 (if you don't know what i'm talking about, sorry...)  a good song, nonetheless.<br />3. wish you were here - the first single from the album.  i was kind of disappointed when i first heard it on kroq, but it grew on me.  wonderful song, can't get enough of it.<br />4. just a phase - my favorite on the album.  very musical, wonderful lyrics, and an astounding melody.  i really like the 2 and a half minute intro, too :)<br />5. 11am - another great song.  soft and kinda slow, but with a nice range of notes, and cool lyrics.<br />6. blood on the ground - one of my least favorites on the album.  got fun lyrics, especially the bridge, but i don't really like the sound of it.<br />7. mexico - the ballad of the album... kinda reminds you of drive, with the whole acoustic guitar thing goin' on.  a wonderful song, great lyrics, and just an overall treat for the ears.<br />8. warning - it's a great song, and it's a shame the radio version had to be cut shorter... it's a wonderful song with a great melody.  the video's pretty cool too :)<br />9. echo - all i can say about this song is wow.  thelyrics are amazing, and the music is great to listen to... only one problem - the little guitar filler riff between the first chorus and second verse... listen to it, and you'll find out what i mean.<br />10. have you ever - my other least favorite.  too much of the yell-singing, not enough of the real singing.  fun once in a while, though.<br />11. are you in? - oh, man... i love it.  just listen to it.<br />12. under my umbrella - the other &quot;hard rock&quot; song on the album.  this one's just awesome.  i don't know what it is about it, but every time i listen to it, i get chills.  great stuff<br />13. aqueous transmission - with a name like that, it's gotta be a great song.  kinda repetetive with the japanese string instrument though... but a really relaxing, easy-listening song.  one of the best on the album - just don't listen to it while driving.<br />there you have it, all the songs and my opinions on them.  now my advice to you?  buy this cd RIGHT NOW.  you won't regret it.  and if you do, well, you're out 15 bucks.  =)
B00005NEUF|5.0|This is the best album I bought since Nirvana's Unplugged. Not that they're related, except for the fact that The Strokes are as important for finally bringing that much needed fresh to the music scene. There's not a bad song on this cd, and the import actually includes New York City Cops, which is an awesome song (that got left out of the US version because of 9/11) <br />The Strokes are amazing!

B00006G8HX|3.0|Star Trek III takes a lot of flak for being slow-moving and a bit pedantic and, hey, in many respects this is fair criticism. I choose instead to focus on two things:<br />1. The \\"Star Trek Trilogy\\" (Movies II, III, and IV encompass one long mission) is a great story, and this movie is a fine bridge between the Khan encounter and the time-travel mission to Earth. <br />2. (SPOILER ALERT FOR THE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE) This movie contains two of the most entertaining happenings in the Star Trek universe -- the theft of the Enterprise and the destruction of the ship.<br />The new DVD will finally make the movie, rough on both widescreen VHS and the earlier DVD, look refreshed. The Search for Spock isn't the greatest voyage in the Trek universe, but it's a good ride and serves its purpose well. Recommended.
B00005MP58|4.0|Clearly, enormous effort went into the making of the BBC adaption of Pride and Prejudice, and the result is amazing. The book had long been a favorite of mine, and while I waited impatiently for the rerelease on DVD during the summer of 2001, it was well worth the wait, price and anticipation.<br />The first viewing was majestic, and I had never felt a movie had so closely replicated the book than when I first dedicated an entire weekend to viewing and reviewing the movie.<br />Therefore, it was incredibly disappointing to discover on multiple viewings (upon reading the book again) that several of the characterizations fell short. In particular, Mary, Kitty and Lydia are whitewashed in the movie as ignorant girls rather than dynamic characters whose nuances and intricacies can intrigue viewers as well as annoy.<br />Furthermore, and perhaps most disappointing of all, Elizabeth is characterized in perhaps a too modern, too feminist sense. While in the book Elizabeth displays feminist behaviors for the time, she is also acknowledged to get swept away in the frivilous behavior of her younger sisters by looking anxiously for the highly reputed Mr. Bingley, whereas in the movie, she couldn't care less about romance and the thrill of the pursuit. Her relationship with Charlotte is underplayed and with Jane overdrawn. Elizabeth is right too often, and humbled too seldom, resulting in a lowered enjoyment of the supplementary characters. Where in the book, Jane is charitable in her kind opinions of the Bingley sisters, in the movie she is blind to their faults while Elizabeth sees them straightaway. In the book, Darcy is the titular pride. In the movie, it is Elizabeth.<br />The movie is beautiful and highly recommended; however, the carelessness with the nuances of characters' personality detracts upon closer scrutiny from the book to the film.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I rented this movie because, as a Jane Austen fan, I am always anxious to see how her work has been translated to film. I was very pleased. However, I BOUGHT this DVD based on other's recommendations because, despite some flaws ( like the added superflicious scene and Charles and Mary having been only married<BR>for four years { see page one of the book) their boys are about 7  and 5) the movie catches the spirit of the book. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hind are great; so is Sophie Thompson  and the actors ( names ? I'm sorry) who play Charles Mugrove, the Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Loved their performances.   Thank you, other reviewers. See someone does read these!
B00006399Z|4.0|this cd-partly recorded at a concert to raise money for an underground paper seemingly dedicated to scandalizing the british ruling class any-and-every way-is actually quite good,considering the completely one-off approach and performance.considering the songs individually one is immediately struck by certain defects in the execution,though.MEDICATED GOO is rushed along,too up-tempo as though the lads were in some kind of race to finish.the two dave mason numbers are interesting in a way although not quite sincere somehow-stage fright,perhaps?DEAR MISTER FANTASY and GIMME SOME LOVIN' are decidedly on target-the target being easy to hit.but hold everything for the best performance on this disc-perhaps the best performance the band ever gave.(roamin' thru the gloamin'with)FORTY THOUSAND HEADMEN can be understood as the culmination-brillantly executed-of the entire psychdelic vibe and atmosphere winwood and company were attempting to put across since 1967.this smoky,stoned music clutches the listener like an ante-diluvian acid trip-monkeys glimpsing the miraculous power of the word of god as they discover the divine plants.from the first note to the roar of the crowd at the conclusion,this performance of the old stand-by leaves nothing unsaid-complete,utter,total beauty.beware-sometimes music this powerful grabs you so firmly it's impossible to break free.it can take you to a place so alien and unknown the way back is nowhwere to be found.but who won't take the chance?
B000069CWE|4.0|I wasn't a huge fan of their first album, however, this one is quite interesting. Bringing in different artists to spice up the pretty dull songs was a good idea. I liked most tracks, some were a little too weird though. All in all a good buy.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is an unbelievably great debut and instantly puts Interpol at the top of the American music scene (not to mention the rest of the world).  Gorgeous melodies, dreamy vocals and a totally unique new sound that everyone will be talking about years from now. Think Joy Division with dabs of Sonic Youth and Sigur Ros, but more wonderful melodies then all three combined. I can't stop listening to this record. If you buy one record this year, this is it.
B000068IEU|5.0|Finally it comes to dvd. \\"Last House On the Left,\\" Wes Craven's directorial debut, is raw, powerful, emotional and absorbing. The infamous film gained quite a cult following since it's release in the 1970's and is still admired by fans of the genre today. The film is a violent journey into murder, rape, torture and humiliation like few other films have captured before. The movie has such a raw realism to it that it's hard not to wince at certain scenes, even for horror vets like myself. Make no mistake, if you are easily offended or are against violence in films than this is not your cup of tea. <br />The movie is about Mari and her friend Phyllis going to a rock concert in a bad part of town. They try to score some grass and end up getting kidnapped by a band of fugitives freshly escaped from prison. And the movie goes from there. (I don't want to spoil anything for those of you who haven't seen it)<br />The movie is expertly filmed and the acting is very strong. Really creating the realism that Wes was shooting for. The soundtrack is laugh out loud great really bringing to life the time period that this movie took place in. David Hess does a fantastic job as usual playing the leader of a band of psychos. (For another great gem with Hess, check out \\"House on the Edge of the Park\\") The film is a very powerful and raw look into the horrors that real life can bring. It's disturbing and downright mean. Pure Genious and a masterpiece of American film making. <br />The dvd looks about as good as a movie from 1970 can. There are some issues with the picture, but it's acceptable for the time period. The audio could be better. Included in the extras are a commentary track with Wes and some documentaries. I haven't had the chance to watch them yet, but they sound very good.<br />This one is for Horror/Terror film fans only. If you're not a huge fan of horror you probably won't like this film. But for all of us out there who love these movies, we are in for a treat. Pick thisone up today and witness one of the best and most controversial horror movies of all time!
0060989157|5.0|THE DIRT gives us the behind the scenes look at the band that we thought we knew almost everything about. MOTLEY CRUE has been one of the top rock bands of the last 20 years and now we know the rest of the story. We get a look at their childhoods upto the present. I can say that there is never a dull moment when reading this book. The tales they tell make all the other rock stories seem tame. We see how drugs nearly destroyed the band, how dysfunctional their relationships with each other are. We get to see who slept with who's girlfriend, usually it was Vince the sex maniac. All the dirt of the last 20 years of the band is on display here and if you are a fan of the band, you will read this and really get the whole story. If you are just an avid reader, then I think that you will also enjoy this book. This book gets 2 thumbs up

630280082X|4.0|The plot of this movie is interesting, if not a bit shallow and clichd.  The acting is mediocre as well.  Like &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, what makes this movie great is the soundtrack.  Ry Cooder plays some excelent guitar, and I must admit that Ralph Macchio does a very convincing job mimicing the guitar parts on screen (perhaps that's why he got the part?).  This is a great movie for blues fans in general and especially those interested in Robert Johnson and the Delta blues.  Even if your not a blues fan, the guitar parts in this movie (especially the famous &quot;Duel Scene&quot;) are worth the price of the movie.  I watched the duel over and over again and it made my jaw drop every time.
0316666343|3.0|I got suckered into the hype on this one.  It's an okay read.  I thought the premise extremely interesting--a girl in heaven as the narrator looking down on earth.  The part where the dead-girl-in-heaven inhabits another girl's earth body and seduces her high school crush was a little over the top for me.  Susie's heaven sounds to me like a flat emotionless place.  I hope the other side is not like this at all!
B00005RYLE|5.0|INTRO:  Evil Dead was/and still is one of the most fun you'll ever have watching a horror movie.  This is also Sam Raimi's (director of the new Spider-man movie) first movie he directed professionally...well, he did Super 8 movies...do those count?  Also, this is the first major movie Bruce Campbell (Brisco Country Jr, Serving Sara) performed in.  If you don't know the series by now, this is the first of the Evil Dead series, and one of the best as well.  As the series progresses, you'll notice that it becomes more slapstick, but this one is shere horror at its best.  From monsters being locked in the basement, to blood gushing out of every fixture in the house, this is a must for any horror fan.<br />PLOT:  Well, it is your typical \\"kids go out alone in the woods only to be attacked by monsters\\" bit.  Except this movie lets the gore come through in full swing.  Of course the special effects are outdated (stop motion animation, rubber legs being stabbed) but its still better than even today's best horror movies.  I won't spoil much more, so see it for yourself.<br />DVD:  This DVD should get the \\"DVD-of-the-Year\\" award.  Sculpted by Tom Sullivan (the man who did various props and special effects for all three movies), this DVD case looks like the Book of the Dead used in the movie pretty good.  There are even pages within the book that are replicas of the movie's...bet you didn't think they would make a DVD case like that eh?  Its got a rubbery feel that is different from the typical cardboard, plastic, tin casing that you see so abundant today.  Really refreshing!  Also, the DVD itself isn't half-bad either.  The menus are remarkable and pretty cool.  The extras I will explain below.<br />EXTRAS:  I would rank the extras alone with a 5/5 stars mainly because there is so much to look at.  There are two screens of movies and short trailers to watch as well as multiple featurettes.  I can't believe how well-done this DVD is.  Also, a featurette describing actor BruceCampbell himself is included.  Its VERY entertaining if you are a Bruce Campbell fan as am I.<br />AUDIO:  The audio has been restored to excellent quality.  Its hard to believe this movie was once a poor 16mm movie with bad audio.  Its just amazing as you watch it that you get lost in it and forget its flaws.<br />VIDEO:  The video as well has been restored to clean, crispness as it should be.  Originally a dark and grainy movie, now a detailed and texturized video transfer is what this classic horror movie deserves.  If you saw the original version in theater, you would probably cry at the difference.<br />OVERALL:  Overall, I think you know what I've been implying the entire time.  But don't settle for the basic DVD version, you HAVE to get this version.  $30-$40 for a prop replica created by the same guy who did the props, plus the DVD itself with hours of extras is an EXTREMELY great buy.  If you are a fan of horror, Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi films, old remakes, or just great DVD deals, then get this.  Anyone else...just have an open mind and give this a try!
044022425X|5.0|Diana Gabaldon's Scots romances are unparalleled.  In this 4th book, she shows her ability to keep aging characters strong and interesting and introduces new blood to the plot lines.  The character studies remain the strength of her book, although Clare's daughter comes off a little stupid in this one.  Diana trades the Highlands for Colonial America giving a fresh glimpse into pre-revolutionary war pioneer life.
B00003CXBK|5.0|INTRO:  4/5 people like this movie usually.  Out of all the people I have ever met that watched this movie, I can count the people who didn't like it on one hand.  Its a great fantasy movie that depicts Japanese culture, great fight scenes, awesome storytelling, and a lot of nature.  I know a lot of people are already thinking that a nature movie can't be that cool...well, this movie definitely proved even me wrong! <br />First of all I would like to mention that even though this movie is rated PG-13 and depicts some scenes of violence, I wouldn't hesitate to show this to a younger kid.  There are like 2 scenes I would question, but they aren't even that bad.  This movie has so much beauty that a lot of people just look at the violence and immediately call it mature, when in reality its far from that. Take a look at a lot of supposed &quot;kid-aimed anime shows&quot; and you'll notice a lot more fan service and violence than this movie.  I shake my head at those sad souls that say this should be an R movie.<br />DVD:  The DVD is average, but great at the same time just because it is Princess Mononoke.  But looking at it unbiased, its just average.  You have the basic Chapter Selection, Language Selection, Subtitles, and Extras as usual.  But its far from complaining.<br />EXTRAS:  Not too much to keep someone going for a long time after the movie is over.  There is a featurette that talks about the dub, and how the actors that dubbed it felt about the movie.  Some other extras not really worth mentioning like trailers.  But its a nice effort.<br />AUDIO:  Japanese and English audio tracks are included, but this is one of the rare cases when I would have to say the English out-does the Japanese by-far.  The English dub was not your typical dub mind you.  They recruited many famous actors like Gillian Anderson (X-Files), and Billy Bob Thorton (Switchblade) that play the characters perfectly.  They really went all-out on it and there is a lot more &quot;feeling&quot; behind the voices.  Watch and compare.<br />VIDEO:  Very crisp and clean.  I could eat off of my screen if it weren't so dusty.  I didn't expect any less.<br />OVERALL:  This is DEFINITELY a must in any movie-lover's collection... be they anime-fan or not.  I hesitated too long to get this movie and was glad when I did.  This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and get really attached to the characters, its just that good.  I can see them re-doing the DVD though in the near-future with more extras and such since this DVD didn't have a lot in that category.  Look for &quot;Princess Mononoke Special Edition 2-Disc DVD Set&quot; one day, but until then, do yourself a favor and get this version.  You won't be let down.
0440217563|3.0|The story follows Clare back in her current time through her pregnancy and the growing years of her daughter until she's ready to venture back through the standing stones to spend the twilight of her life with the man who owns her heart.  At the same time, we get a glimpse of Jamie's life in post-Jacobite Scotland as a war criminal and his struggles to survive after the Battle of Culloden and the disbanding of the clans.<BR>Although I love Diana Gabaldon, in this third of her Outlander series, the always-in-trouble hero is in trouble too often and the traveling left me with whiplash.  She has a lot of ground to cover to get the hero and the heroine back together over a span of years and unfortunately, it was a rough ride.  I would still recommend it, the meat of the story is well worth it and the detail is still good reading.
B00006G8G1|5.0|considering it took several listenings, to make a fair review<BR>of the audio cd version, i have been worried about this dvd for<BR>awhile. however, i am very pleased. my only disappointment is the fact i don't have a surround sound receiver yet which would<BR>give it an extra kick. the sound quality is superb and the visuals are solid. all in all what a great souvenir for anyone<BR>who saw them on tour in 2000-2001. steve did an excellent job editing the visuals and not to much of the retro camera which was<BR>way over used in the live donington video to give more of a live<BR>performance instead of a 2 hour music video. the extras are cool but not as good as the live show. the live show captures the energy and friendship within the band that they haven't shown in years. adrian, actually played to the camera a little. this is the best live performance captured on film of Maiden. the setlist<BR>is slightly boring, but the band more than make up for it in their energy. live after death is a better soundtrack, however as good as the video is and will always be, it lacks the same intensity as rio. this is Maiden at their very best!
B000066NW0|5.0|Listening this is like going through the mind of someone in an intense relationship through songs, each song a stage of the relationship.The songs in the beginning start off with a mixture of confidence and strength and toward the end the listener is stripped \\"naked\\" by the vulnerability the singer gives off. I can honestly say that this cd has not spent more than a day out of my cd player and is cycled through about three or four times. In my opinion the best tracks are:<BR>Anything but ordinary, things I'll never say, mobile, and perhaps the best song on the entire album...Tomorrow
0440219078|4.0|Set in a culture that has been genetically chosen to represent Sameness, freedom is a word that cannot be understood.  A committee makes decisions regarding a person's clothing, job, spouse and even children.  These people know no other way of life and so do not question it.  They are unfeeling drones in a world designed to eliminate pain, embarrassment and any type of negative emotions.  In doing so, the positive emotions have disappeared as well.  A young boy is chose to be the successor of the one person who does have the knowledge of what life was once like.  They become lockboxes of this wisdom that cannot be shared, only transferred.  Through their transmissions and discussions they idealize to share both love and pain with the Community and therefore forever change them.  This book brings up a lot of issues for preteens be-ginning puberty.  The Community could be a metaphor for a child's life before he opens his eyes and starts to experience it for himself without being protected from anything that could go wrong.<br />Why 4 stars?:<BR>I feel this is a wonderful piece of literature.  However, I took one star off because teachers and parents must be incredibly careful when introducing this book to children.  I have seen it used as young as fourth grade, but it is so intense and brings up so many issues about life as we know it (and don't know it yet), that it takes a very mature audience.  It should only be used with close supervision and guidance.
0446604844|5.0|From page one I got sucked into this book. I had to force myself to not read it in the evenings because I wanted to save the pages for my lunch breaks.  All 692 pages were worth it.  It was very suspenseful, believable, and intense.  Instantly, I became sympathetic and defensive of the Archers.  They seemed like the perfect couple who could do no wrong.  Baldacci does a great job building the suspense and keeping you guessing on the outcomes.  Even at the end there are a few surprises.<br />The one draw back from this book was trying to keep track of all the characters and their significance with the plot.  If you aren't going to read it consistently, you may forget who is who and what has happened.  This book is full of information and hidden hints, and if you aren't reading carefully, you will miss out.<br />Otherwise, it was a very entertaining novel.  Baldacci is becoming one of my favorite authors.  Happy reading!  Ü
0316666343|1.0|I can't believe that so many people liked this book. The way the story is told is interesting, but it wears off quickly. This is a story of a little girl who is murdered. There is no way to make this comforting to the reader or have us believe that good things can come from this. Yes life goes on, but for Susie it is over, no lovemaking with Ray while Ruth is gone that's for sure. Come on, this is all just too manipulative..
B000069CWE|5.0|I'm not a huge Linkin Park fan, so these praises don't stem from that.  And of course I've heard/read all the criticisms about how the new metal can't compare to the old, and how the new stuff all rips from LB and Korn and blah blah blah. Whatever;  who cares?  This cd shocked me with its departure from the original, and all I know is that the sound is phenomenal. I found it to be creative, engaging, and thrilling at a level surely more primal than that of intellectual criticism -- and hence much more fun. (Oh, wait: wasn't that what rock was all about in the first place?) Regardless, for all you non-purists, this cd is highly recommended.
0060930187|3.0|I'm just getting really sick of depressed &quot;genius&quot;es.  I know that perhaps when it was written this book had more pull, but right now the genius syndrome is just getting old.  I don't mind characters with sad heads, but as long as they are presented in a new way.  The way Esther is presented is &quot;oh, I'm so sad, but God I get a lot of awards and people really really like me, but oh no! and I'm the smartest person in this entire story and blah blah.&quot;  Trust me, I realize that this is extremely realistic and everyone gets sad, but I just wanted a little more from the writer-something jarring.  But, I always expect too much.  Still worth reading-obviously very influential.
0385335482|5.0|i am not the type of person who likes to sit down and read a book, but i could just not put his one down! i sopen thalf of my vacation in europe just reading this novel. i was absolutely in love with becky bloomwood, and all of kinsella's accompanying characters. while becky was out of control, she provided a nice break from everyday life. part of the reason she is so enjoyable is because she is willing to do all the things that we aren't.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I saw Apocalypse Now Redux on the Sundance channel. I liked it mainly because this is the first time I've seen it. It's about a Lieutenant named Willard who is sent on a mission to kill a renegade colonel sometime in the Vietnam War. There are many extra footage inserted into the Redux like the French plantation, where Willard steals someone's surfboard(can't remember the name), and women at a medivac camp. These scenes don't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still a great movie nonetheless.
0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold has written a tender, moving story of a teenage girl watching her world move past her from her vantage point in heaven.<br />Sound contrived?  It could be in the hands of a less talented artist.  <br />Destined to be a great novel of the new century?  Probably not, although we'll certainly see a feature film come out of the deal and this will long be a \\"reading group\\" book due to its subject matter: the rape and murder of a child, coming of age sexuality, strained family relationships, and divorce.<br />I found the first five chapters breath taking, but by the time I ended the book I thought it was pretty okay.  My advice would be that most people who like literary fiction will find this a fine filler between heavier books and most people who like detective stories will find this a little slow, given that it's about the absence of the narrator (Susie Salmon) more than chasing her killer. <br />Perhaps the only disappointing parts come at the end, which make them more disappointing.  (The neat nip and tuck of plot-lines; the character happily loving each other.)  <br />The scenes of heaven were unusual, but as much of a let-down as Dante's Paradiso after his gripping Inferno.  We just can't imagine how good heaven is, so it is reduced to a place where Susie can always get ice cream and play with dogs.<br />Sebold has written a novel with life and verve, even if it's narrated by a dead girl.
6304466498|4.0|Spaceballs is almost as Funny as Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstien. I think because of the success of those two movies all of mel Brooks future movies fail due to comparison.<br />This movie mainly makes fun of Star Wars. It stars Bill Pullman (before he did some serious alien [tush] whoopping in Independance Day). He was a combination of Luke Skywalker and Hans Solo dressed up like Indiana Jones. The story line is totally ridiculus. The evil spaceballs plan to take all of the air from their neighbor planet Druidia. Don't ask me why they need such a huge ship to reach their neighbor.<br />Rick Moranis was funny as the Darth Vader like Dark Helmet.<BR>Mel Brooks played poth president Skroob and Yogurt (who can speak yiddish). Princess Vespa was the princess Leia like princess. This movie basically pokes fun at Star Wars. I have listed some of the others.<br />Star Trek- Being Beamed by Snotty. Who for some apparent reason is dressed in a scottish costume. President Skroob is beamed but his rear end end up being backwards.<br />Wizard of Oz- The Giant Statue of Yogurt that speaks<BR>\\"Who dares to enter the presence of the imperial know it all YOGURT!\\"<br />Aliens- The creature coming out of John Hurts stomach at the diner and him saying \\"Oh no! not again!\\" then the creature sings and dances \\"My ragtime gal\\". Also the large ship of Spaceball one is like the ship in Aliens.<br />Planet of the Apes- They land on the planet of the apes and the transpormed ship looks like the Statue of Liberty sitting on the beach as in the end of \\"Planet of the Apes\\"<br />Ofcourse the movie made fun of star wars. Each main character had a star wars counter part:<BR>Lone Star        Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker<BR>Barf             Chewbakka<BR>Princess Vespa   Princess Leia<BR>King Roland      Leia's Adoptive Father ( He never is seen in    <BR>                 the movie he may be the king at the end of star<BR>                 Wars).<BR>Dot Matrix       C3PO (Sorry no R2D2!)<BR>YogurtYoda<BR>Pizza the Hut    Yabba the Hut <BR>Dark Helmet      Darth Vader<BR>President Skroob Emperor Paladin
B00005JKLZ|4.0|This is a film that carefully balances respect for the George Pal classic while trying to present new material without scarificing the original plot. Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H.G. Wells, does it for the most part. The Time Machine is a dazziling display of effects while allowing the characters to provide the binding so necessary to hold an audineces's attention. The creature features are a bit weak but the lavish photography and the pulse pounding pace leave little time for observation and complaint. Put on your fuzzy slippers, fire up the microwave popcorn and settle back for a time trip worth the taking.
0345446798|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read on the subject. McConnell's book is not a &quot;how to&quot; training book, but rather an insightful, well-written book about canine behavior. (She's an ethologist and a certified animal behaviorist specializing in aggression.)<br />I also highly recommend the enormously useful book &quot;Understanding 'Dog Mind,'&quot; by Bonnie Bergin. This is perhaps the single best book ever written on canine behavior and training. (Bergin pioneered the &quot;service dog&quot; concept and founded the first and largest organization training service dogs for the disabled.)
0316666343|1.0|This book has a gimmick (a spy in heaven) -- so does Dave Eggers's book, and so does Atonement.  Those gimmicks work, but this gimmick becomes very very tiresome very very soon.  Even so, I'd stick with it if the writing were good.  It's precious, and not for mature readers. I keep on, thinking, surely, any moment... but no.  What I'll remember from this is that even fabulous writers like Jonathan Franzen have publicists and editors who can coerce him into writing a blurb.  That's how the system works.  Read Three Junes by Julia Glass instead.
B000062Y98|1.0|I have to agree with a previous reviewer from Aug. 5,2002, Rand Al-Thor. I could have written that myself with only two exceptions;<BR>1) I didn't hear the bonus track that actually had real singing as I couldn't get past the fifth track without cringing in near agony over the auful and overbearing vocals (kind of like those senes from Star Trek where everyone on the bridge is covering there ears and falling to the floor - they must have had this disc on).<BR>2)I have never heard anything from Blind Guardian before this one, so I have no frame of reference to any past work. Doubtful I ever will after this mess.<BR>I do so agree with him also about the drunken, disorderly croud noise. That is the first thing I thought when I first played  this CD. I've learnes my lesson about buying a CD based on the good reviews. From now on I will listen first!! This one will end up at the local used CD store.
B0000028M7|3.0|This is what happens when you are barraged with imitations before you hear the original.  &quot;Dirt&quot; was no doubt groundbreaking when it was originally released, as evidenced by the current bands who imitate Alice In Chains' style (Creed, Godsmack).  Unfortunately, the album has not aged well over the last decade.<br />Don't get me wrong, I understand that this is one of the most important albums of the grunge era, and I do appreciate the emotional quality in both the lyrics and Layne Staley's vocal delivery, and Jerry Cantrell's guitar simply rocks.  However, I missed the grunge revolution by about 5 years, and by the time I became interested in music, all that was left of the movement was post-grunge fallout.  It is perhaps a testament to this album's influence that 10 years later, there are still so many bands playing in this style that I was sick of the music before I even had a chance to hear it.<br />I honestly wish I could convince myself to like this album, but I've listened to it 5 times, and it still sounds mediocre.  A classic that was ruined by its imitators
B0000399WI|4.0|If you're considering buying the Shawshank Redemption on DVD, you probably already know that this is an excellent movie about having and finding the inner strength to overcome life's obstacles. You probably don't need to be convinced that this is one of the most moving and effective adaptations from a book to film ever made. You also know that each role is exceptionally well-cast and well-acted. You already want the movie for the movie's sake.<br />What you don't know is why you should buy the DVD vs. VHS vs. renting. I have both the VHS and DVD. The VHS gave me the movie, so does the DVD offer enough more to warrant the additional purchase?  Probably not. The DVD provides a wide-screen view, alternate language tracks, a photo gallery of stills taken during the shoot (nothing exciting here), short Bios of maybe 4-5 of the major players (Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, director, etc), and trailer.  No additional/deleted scenes or commentary by anyone. If you want the wide screen feel, go for the DVD.  If you just want to play the movie on demand, the VHS is fine. Owning both versions is redundant.
6305511055|5.0|Forget K-19, take Three Days of The Condor home and be sure that you have everything that you need before you press play. Once the film starts you won't be able to leave it for a minute. From start to finish it is compelling. Max Von Sydow offers the very best urbane hit man ever and of course Robert Redfrod was born to be the hero. There isn't a thing that this film needs except a sequel.
0380977788|3.0|Neil although a gifted author should be saved for a more mature audience. I gave a low rating for this book because it is clearly not material for a young reader.  The story itself was well crafted and interesting.  The groteque despriptions of the characters made me turn on an extra light. This however is a not a book you tuck your children in to bed with.
0060506989|2.0|While showing great care in getting names, facts, dates and times right the authors of this book nevertheless fail miserably to draw you into the battle.  This book reads like a gigantic action report intended for the higher brass.  You're told things like \\"Seargent xxx from Middletown, Nebraska took an AK-47 shot in the shoulder that exited from the middle back.  2nd Platoon of Bravo Company was pinned down by heavy automatic weapons fire on the left.\\"  After going though half the book I just gave up.  I could not generate enough enthusiasm to pick it up again.  This is a rare thing for me.  I hate leaving a book unfinished, and I particularly like war stories.  This textbook approach is only interesting as a tool for analyzing the battle.  The battle this book describes is one of the fiercest in the entire war and requires an author who can recreate that energy and horror in a way that puts you in the action.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for me with these authors.  For a much better read on Vietnam  try \\"If I die in a combat zone\\" by Tim Obrien.  The events are far more trivial in that book then those described here, but it is much more compelling somehow.  For a book that captures the wild kinetic energy of a heavy, sustained firefight check out \\"Black Hawk Down\\" by Mark Bowden.
B00005NWM3|3.0|What the heck happened to Canada?<br />Why is it that our neighbor to the north keeps giving us music that is so incredibly blah?<br />On one side, you have Avril Lavigne, a teen pop star who pretends she isn't one, and on the other side, you have Nickelback.<br />This album really isn't that bad, but the problem is that it's not that good either.  Nickelback is definately hard rock; any harder and people would start calling them metal.  Unfortunately, with the exception of one or two songs like &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; the album sounds like one big, loud angstfest.<br />What happened to the days when Canada gave us artists like Rush?
B000002ADT|5.0|&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is one of the most important Jazz albums, there is no doubt about it. It contains many Jazz Standards, and the imrovisasions are great, so it can be, and should be, a very good album for Jazz players to learn from. I know I did. As an educational album, this is one of the tops of my list.<br />However, as it comes to listening for enjoyment, I have other<BR>Albums on the top. Yet, it is only a result of my personal taste. I like my Jazz fast-going, sharp and with crazy improvisasions that push both the player and the instrument to their best abilities. I really like, for example &quot;Sonny Side Up&quot;, that would be a good example for this kind of Jazz. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; however, just like its name, is a different story. It is slow and very thoughtful. Davis' improvisasions are very restrained, as if he is covering on something. This album is filled with emotion, but you should be in a special mood to listen to it. Sometimes I find it boring, and go back to my fast-going jazz, and sometimes I really like it. In any case, this album is a must in every Jazz colletion.
B000002URV|3.0|Who have not heard of Engima?<br />I first heard about Enigma when I was at 12 year old. The hit Song Sadeness Part 1 was a wordwide success. That strange song captured my young and curious heart so I bought the cassette wanting to hear more of their sound. The music I can say is very very dark. After a few listening I got so scared that I decided to throw the cassette away. The strangest thing about this record is that it has the ability to intrude your mind. <br />That was then, now (for 12 years) I am a huge fan of Engima, I own most of their CDs from Engima 2 to their lastest LSD. My collection will not be complete without MCMXC AD I thought. So I decided to give this CD another chance. I went and bought it. The moment I played the CD, the Ghostly music sent the same shivers down my spine once more as it tranported me back to the time when I first listen to it. I tried very hard to accept the music but still I failed. I am not saying that the music is bad. It's just that I find this music so powerful that it is very disturbing especially if you listen to it as a whole (from the beginning track to the last track).<br />Even though I particulary like 3 tracks on this album, I gave it away. Later, I bought the singles for Sadeness Part 1 and MelCupa and downloaded Callas went away. <br />Maybe you had heard of them for a long time but have not own any of their album and pondering whether you should but buy this (highly recommendated but everyone here)I would advise to BUY IT if you are experimental enough! Otherwise I strongly recommend LSD (the greatest hit) and Engima 2. And if you like my recommendation, buy everything by Engima!

B00003RQNJ|5.0|A story of two Western bankrobbers with contemporary humor and music that gives the story a youthful appeal. How can you not love it? Robert Redford and Paul Newman bring a charm to the film that few of today's actors can muster, and Katharine Ross is both beautiful and likable as the woman who will follow the oulaws anywhere they ask her to go. The film's wry humor, however, is what really has maintained it as a true classic. How could anyone not be charmed by Paul Newman's bicycle stunts?  The sets and costumes are perfectly suited for the era and beautifully recreated.Also, the ending of this film is very well done, the final frame a simple still shot of the two men the audience doesn't want to watch die. This film is a classic that generations will continue to enjoy for many years to come.

B00003CXXP|5.0|So many reviews both positive and negative, so just a few words.<br />WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILER<br />The beings at the end of the movie are not aliens they are highly advanced robots searching, or more specifically digging, for information about those extinct creatures that indirectly created them,... human beings.  Those of you who thought they were aliens and that the ending was happy missed all the symbolism and meaning in the movie.  Rewatch the movie and you will see. If robots at the end 5 stars, if aliens 1 star,.... likely explains much of the wide variety of ratings.
0790729342|4.0|the Road Warrior, second entry in the Mad Max series, lives up to its title. Mad Max is back at it again when a small gas outpost is being blocked by a gang of &quot;mean&quot; biker guys. Max is obligated to help the small community living there by planning an attack to rid off the bikers. Somewhat of nothing of a plot. Mel Gibson is always great as Mad Max. The special effects are dazziling and mind blowing. Does get slow at times ,but just wait till the finale!
B000069HKH|5.0|Welcome to the Church of Rock and Roll, with your preacher, the right Reverend Bruce Springsteen.  Come in, for 73 minutes of love and loss, guilt, sin, prayer and redemption. So come on, rise up, come on up for the rising, open up your hymnal and sing along with the Boss and the E-Street Band.<br />The destruction of the World Trade Center and the astonishing loss of life on September 11, 2001 were a defining moment for all of us.  It looms large even now; too large for art to capture it.  Or so it seemed until the release of The Rising.  <br />No other musician could have made this album.  No one else has the combination of stature, sincerity and talent to have created an album which gives vent to the shock and the anger, and the grief and the loss we experienced that day.  That The Rising accomplishes this and more is a minor miracle.<br />Springsteen's gift is his ability to inhabit his characters fully, and to tell their stories as if they were his own.  Here he tells the story of those of us left behind to sort through the wreckage and to mourn our losses.   Songs are offered up as prayers; Into the Fire's chorus, &quot;May your strength give us strength, may your faith give us faith, may your hope give us hope, may your love give us love&quot;, sung by a fireman's widow.   The last song on the album commands us to &quot;Rise up, come on rise up&quot; from the ruins.  There is despair here, but there's also hope.  As he asks in Mary's Place, &quot;How do you live broken hearted?&quot;  <br />The E-Street band seems muted.  There are flashes of the old magic; a hint of Roy Bittan's piano, a saxophone solo by the Big Man, Clarence Clemons, or a bit of Danny Federici's organ do shine through.  But the production doesn't emphasize these things, and somehow this is more fitting given the material.  Mary's Place comes closest to sounding like something off The River.  The rest of the album is tinged with gospel, country, folk, soul and rock.  <br />All in all, thisalbum is a religious experience.  Through lyrics and music, Bruce Springsteen has managed to pull off the impossible, making a listenable, serious artistic statement when such things are all but obsolete. That he does it without preaching makes it all the more remarkable.

B000001DTM|5.0|I'd have to agree with the other reviews,Actung Baby is definately music at it's best.Ever since I first heard it in 93'it's remained my fave U2 album with Zooropa a close second.Every song is a standalone classic, even the weaker songs like 'Mysterious Ways' and 'Acrobat' are are still great.No other U2 ablum can really be played start to finish and work as well as this record.Achtung Baby is one of those records that captures a band at their absolute peak in terms of songcraft and inspired experimentation.Everyone will know the radio tracks like &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot; but this only scratches the surface,you have to hear songs like 'Until the End of the World' and 'Zoo Station' to truly appreciate what U2 can do.<BR>My personal favourite tracks would have to be &quot;Until the end of the World&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing&quot;....well I could pick any of the tracks without sounding too biased,it's just that good of a record.Although Zooropa followed this up with a masterful mix of experimentation I think Achtung Baby tops it.

0316666343|5.0|This was an amazing book. Frankly I was leary of the premise but the author's style made the story bearable, one you needed to hear to the end.   I flew through it so quickly, I made myself stop and think about what was happening. The wonderful story telling was not bogged down by sentimentality.  The straight forward narration made the horrible loss bearable. Alice Sebold talks with the simplicity of a young child who has learned a great  truth.
0688172377|4.0|Desert Flower<BR>By Waris Dirie,<BR>Virago Press, 369 pages<BR>____________________________________<br />Louise Nicholls<br />Desert Flower is an intimate journey through the childhood, adolescence and early adulthood of the author, Waris Dirie. Inspiring and repressive are two words that best describe the polarities that are Dirie's life.<br />Dirie came from a strict African culture that endorsed female circumcision. The only way to describe the pain and suffering endured by Dirie, (as a five year old) is devastating. This would be considered an absolute violation of human rights in the Western World, however this is one of the best depictions of the cultural difference. Dirie describes it as her \\"womanhood being stolen\\", a true portrayal about her feeling of female circumcision.<br />Throughout Desert Flower  (the meaning of Waris  in the Somali language), Dirie shares her experiences living as a nomad in the harsh and arid desert of Africa. Her description of the surroundings is so powerful, <br />as the reader you can almost smell the desert air. Her flight from her family at age twelve to avoid yet another Somali custom of arranged marriage is inspiring. I feel as if this act took strength and this is<BR> a perfect example of Dirie's courage as described throughout Desert Flower. Dirie explains that she knew \\"this was not the life for her\\" and took her destiny into her own hands.<br />Her journey to freedom was confronting. Along the way Dirie reveals many experiences that will send shivers down your spine. An instance is when a  truck driver picking    her up as a hitch hiker and taking advantage of her susceptible nature and gullibility. Dirie spends time working for her extended family in Mogadishu as a house keeper, baby sitter, cleaner and cook. She then gains employment, as a house keeper, with her uncle, who is also the Somalian Ambassador in England. A fortuitous move to London with her uncle and his family is where the journey, from desert nomad to supermodel, intensifies.<br />As the reader you are encouraged to empathise with Dirie during this time of her life. You feel her suffering with things such as her lack of the English language, the unrelenting work load as house keeper and her  <BR>disturbing encounter with cousin, Haji. Feelings of jubilation are also shared with the reader at happier<BR>times of dressing up and discovering modelling. Dirie <BR>had both positive and negative experiences which create interest for the reader and balance the story.<br />Dirie grows throughout this journey. Desert Flower explores her emergence from a young nomad, in many ways as \\"free as a bird\\" because of the open land of the desert, but in many ways trapped in a   stifling culture, to her <BR>development into a woman super model, a mum and an ambassador for the rights of women in African and other third   world countries.<br />Desert Flower is a quality read and I recommend this inspiring story. This book offers African culture and history, growth and development of a woman who could see light and followed what she knew was waiting for her, but most of all offers inspiration for anyone. It is uplifting to know where you have come from doesn't even compare to Dirie's childhood. To achieve what she has from where she started means that nothing is impossible, it is just a matter of following your dreams, no matter what it takes!
0380789035|3.0|In his most recently published novel, Neil Gaiman begins with an interesting premise whatever happened to the gods of the Old World when people immigrated to New World?<br /> We begin story with the protagonist, Shadow Moon, is finishing the last days of his prison sentence, looking forward to being reunited with his wife Laura and his best friend (and hopeful future employer).  Several days before his scheduled parole release date, his wife and best friend are killed in a car accident.  On his way home to attend the funeral, he encounters a mysterious man with a penchant for Jack Daniels whiskey who calls himself Wednesday.  Shadow agrees to work for Wednesday as an errand-boy for his upcoming travels. They first travel to House on the Rock, a touristy roadside attraction in southwestern Wisconsin and then onto other roadside attractions all across the Midwest.  During his travels, Shadow finds himself as a target for some group that reveals it to be the gods of the modern age, who threaten and then try to persuade Shadow to join their side.  All of these events are leading up to the war that will end all wars, pitting the ancient gods of the Old World against the new gods that have been created under the banner of modern technology and progress.  In addition to all this craziness, Shadows dead wife Laura keeps reappearing in his life<br /> In his quest to answer the previously mentioned question, Gaiman brings in a pantheon of gods from varying cultural traditions, in keeping with the melting pot mentality of American culture.  However interesting it may be to read about gods and goddesses from different religions, Gaiman doesnt seem to completely flesh out his characters.  The gods are somewhat one-dimensional do not really give any idea of the full extent of the former honor and worship that they enjoyed in the Old World.  It is almost necessary to have some background in Scandinavian, Slavic, and African mythologies to better understand these characters. The new gods are even less fleshed out, more stock character villains and thugs, though their names are somewhat telling of what modern society values.  One notable omission is the absence of the gods of the worlds monotheistic religions.  There is little, if any, reference to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.  It seems strange that Gaiman would choose to omit these major players in modern religion. The most nuanced character in the novel is Shadow, but as his name suggests, his identity is cloaked in mystery and the reader is left guessing as to what are his motivations for doing what he does.<br /> Stylistically, the format for the novel works well, layering the main storyline with interludes and vignettes of how some these gods and folkloric creatures came to America.  Gaimans background as a comic book writer comes through in the text, giving the reader a mountain of detail concerning the actions of the characters and the surroundings. At certain points of the novel, the sheer amount of detail slows downs the narrative and adds unnecessary weight to the novel. His graphic portrayals of sexual encounters and violence and the amount of salty language employed as well as his attempts to describe the coin tricks that are so central to the character of Shadow are unneeded and at times offensive to the aesthetics of the reader.  If there is a purpose to demonstrate some aspect of the old religions and gods with these scenes, Gaiman does not succeed in illustrating it.<br /> In the novel, the question is asked why is it hard for the old gods to survive in modern America?  Gaimans theory is that the individualistic trait in American culture that picks and chooses which religious beliefs it is going to follow, that subscribes more to an individual spirituality than a set creed that characterizes most major religions.  Though Gaimans subject matter is fascinating, he leaves little room for the makings of a truly interesting novel.  Within the framework of the novel, there is a possibility to editorialize more and to shape it to be an interesting critique of American culture.  There are hints of this and as Gaiman is British, he is in a prime position to offer the opinions of someone who is not as deeply enmeshed in the culture.  He is given the ball, but doesnt really run with it and ruins much of the novels potential because of it.<br /> On a more positive note, this novel is not entirely bad.  However, I will qualify that statement by saying that I do not see the book as a one that would be popular with a mainstream audience, though it was a New York Times Bestseller.  I see this novel as being geared to a more specific audience in mind that appreciates adult fantasy and horror and I can without reservation say that I am not in that demographic.the novel, there is a possibility to editorialize more and to shape it to be an interesting critique of American culture.

B000063S6Z|2.0|This CD is a lot like Play, but the ingenuity has worn off.  A lot of the songs sound the same.  The best track is &quot;Fly So High&quot; but that's about it.  Moby has made a point in the past that he doesn't want to keep doing the same thing (he did techno, then rock, now pop), but this album seems to be the exception to the rule.<br />Moby: leave Pop behind, and come back to Techno!
B0000584V3|5.0|Words can not describe how awesome Opeth's Blackwater Park is. The album is just to good to put to words but I will try my best. Opeths musical style is in a class by itself, I don't know what to call it but it destroys. One minute you here full on insane Death Metal, the next you here beautifull mellow guitar with peaceful soothing vocals. Each song is like it's own adventure reaching 12- minutes in time. This is the only Opeth album I own and believe me I will buy more. Buy Opeth's Blackwater Park, If you want to here orignial great music.
B00003CXI1|4.0|It's a little embarassing admitting you like a kids movie or book but there should be no shame in watching the Sorcerer's Stone... or reading it for that matter. The movie follows the book suprisingly well, although I believe if I had not read the book first some of the mystery of the movie would have just been confusion. All of the kids in the movie work well together. The acting isn't Oscar material, of course, but for a fun family movie it works. Since the young actors did do so well together I would have liked to seen the deleted scenes added into the movie. The special effects are believable and makes the Quidditch scene great. It does run pretty long for a movie aimed at younger viewers but being an older, more patient viewer, I wouldn't of minded if it made a whole 3 hours.<br />As for the DVD, they could have done a little better. I found it was geared more toward children. You have to go through hoops just to see the 7 deleted scenes. The Interview with the director and others that helped make the movie is about the only redeamable part of the second disc. Maybe I'm too old now to appreciate it but, some of the features on second disc seem a little lame even for kids to enjoy. I would have been pleased with one disc featuring a commentary and one decent documentary although it probably wouldn't play as well to kids.<br />All in all this is a good movie and the second DVD shouldn't ruin your enjoyment of the movie. It is a fun movie that both children and adults can get into...just like the books!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Parts on this album will be in your head for days and will make you want to listen to it over and over again. Especially enjoy Stella was a diver she was always down. Best album so far this year (yes, even better than wilco and trail of dead) Also pick up the 3 song ep for it has one of the best Interpol songs, Specialist, but is not on this album.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is a great adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel.  Is is a perfect adaptation?  No.  The George Pal movie was closer to the original novel.  However, if H. G. were alive today, this movie would, in my opinion, have been the story he would have written (except there would have been more sex in it [H. G. was a proponent of free love, scandalous in his day, not so today]).<br />This version gives the protagonist a reason to create his time machine other than scientific curiosity; the death of his beloved.  His reason for going into the future?  To find a way to revive his beloved after death since he could not change the past.  After finding out what the future holds, he, once again as in the novel and movie, it accidentally thrust into the far future.  Here is where the real adventure begins.<br />I loved the way the actors really made the characters come alive.  Add to that the fact that one of H. G. Well's heirs directed the movie makes it a classic.  However, if the script had not been as good as it was, the whole thing would still have flopped.  Instead, you have one of the best sci-fi movies in recent years.  I'm proud to have it in my movie collection.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I only bought this dvd recently, because i decided now i have a dvd player it was the time to update my much loved kevin smith collection to dvd.   So i watched it for the first time in a year or more and remembered why i became an instant fan all those years ago.  <BR>I was about 16 when i first saw clerks, a recommendation by an older friend, in fact it was just before mallrats made its video debut here.<BR>I was instantly hooked, here was a humour that didnt revolve around jim carrey looking stupid, and it was loud and crude without being dumb in the way a lot of vulgar comedies are (see austin powers).<BR>Shot for peanuts it was nonetheless an excellent showcase for Kevin's unique writing ability, yes his movies are wordy, and so sometimes some scenes are pretentious but this is just an every day guy making every day movies and putting his friends in them (even today) and something about that was real and touching.<BR>The acting by Brian O Halloran and Jeff Anderson in Clerks is excellent considering neither are professional actors, the dialogue and wit just flows and they play off each other with a chemistry many hollywood directors cant even get with $25 million a film actors - its realistic, like two witty friends in a series of endless conversations, quick firing and crude, which if we are realistic, most young people today are, i know i can barely get through a sentence without cursing ;)<BR>it doesnt mean they dont have anything more intelligent to say, as is the excuse in a lot of movies, or for most peoples use of curse words, as Smith's wonderfull dialog shows, its just who they are, and it brings it more down to earth than a lot of these movies or tv shows that strive for realism yet nobody smokes, swears, or does anything really bad.<BR>Anyway, the plot follows the day in the life of two convenience store clerks in a day that ever gets worse - theres the plot right there, thin yes, but also brilliantly simple and achingly funny.<BR>Now, the main purpose of this review is to review the dvd itself, its not as good as the other DVD's by Smith, but it has very good features (including the original (and better) ending) and a directors commentary, that while probably being the worst of all commentaries by Smith Et Al, is still very funny and insightfull - watch out for Jason Mewes passed out for most of the track and just waking up every few minutes to mumble something into the mic.<BR>The transfer is nice, being an \\"amateur\\" film the source probably wasnt that great to begin with, same for the sound<BR>but the features make this an excellent buy at excellent value, so its a total bonus to the film itself being fantastic :)
B00005T33W|5.0|How many films do you watch where most of the dialogue seems real? Rare is the film that emulates our lives. \\"You Can Count On Me\\" was such a film. Add Terry Zweigoff's hilarious \\"Ghost World\\" to this genre.<br />\\"Sixteen Candles\\" and \\"Fast Times At Ridgemont High\\" are thought of fondly because in certain scenes, teenage angst is captured on screen convincingly and with sly humor. Those films, though entertaining, are more farce than a real slice of life, though. \\"Ghost World\\" slams you back to being a teenager from the first moment and rarely seems forced or made up.<br />\\"Ghost World\\" focuses on two graduating young ladies (Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson), and their utter contempt for all of the petty smarminess of High School. Their running commentary is laugh out loud hilarious, and it's as true as it is funny.<br />Birch's character meets a reclusive, nerdy record collector (Steve Buscemi), with whom she strikes up a friendship. This is a great role for Buscemi. Buscemi is often cast as the weird, sarcastic loser. But in \\"Ghost World\\", Zweigoff clearly saw that Buscemi could break away from that stereotype. Buscemi plays the character with a sensitive touch, and a lesser teenage film would have mocked this character rather than respected it.<br />Illeana Douglas also strikes the perfect note as Birch's summer school art teacher. Intelligent - but whacky - Douglas' character is very funny.<br />The end might not appeal to everyone, but its metaphorical nature is very appropriate given Birch's understandable indecisiveness.<br />Roger Ebert said \\"I wanted to hug this film.\\" I couldn't agree more.
B000069CWE|5.0|For those who haven't had the chance to pick this album up yet, or have yet to decide on purchasing it, or for that matter, have never even truly heard Linkin Park, then I suggest you pick this album up the first chance you get.<br />The odd-tempo and techno-like rock beats and turntable mixes we have come to expect from Linkin Park have been fed acid, caffeine, uppers and downers, and the talent of some of the industries best mixers, producers, cutters, and mixers. On of the songs that stands out on the track is the deep, dark, and emotional Crawling track now entitled &quot;Krwling,&quot; which is mixed by Mike Shinoda and features some vocal from Aaron Lewis. The dark, hard, and sharp feeling are once again delivered in a methodical like beat, with a beautiful twist of violins, and the softly exposed voice of Staind frontman, Aaron Lewis.<br />&quot;Pts.Of.Athrty&quot; is totally reedited and remixed to bring a new tempo with loud snare and symbol shots, along with an eerie &quot;ghostly like&quot; cut-in, along with echoing vocals and soft to hard, slow to fast like beats. This song dissolves your mind, enhances your senses, and totally embodies you in its sound and vocals.<br />&quot;ENTH E ND&quot; reminds me of the Method Man/Fred Durst remix of N2Gether Now...Close enough I suppose. With the lyric changes, and voice-ins by Motion Man, this track is definitely improved for the more hip-hop attentive audience. This is one of the tracks that definitely gives truth to the album's name, Reanimation.<br />&quot;By_myslf&quot; has added lyrics, clarity, and an electric guitar over-lacing that gives the song a Euro-Rock like sound that you would expect to be on the &quot;Swordfish&quot; soundtrack.<br />&quot;MY-Dsmbr&quot; is a track that was released on the overseas album of the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; album. The songs soft and elegant melody and vocals, compliments of Chester, offer up something that most avid Linkin Park fans aren't used to hearing. The songslyrics and tone send chills down your spine, and emotional thoughts swirling in your head as you capture the song's intent and focus.<br />Overall, Reanimation is a definite must for Linkin Park fans, and intuitive music lovers of all kinds. For those who are getting restless in hearing the upcoming album by Linkin Park, this one will have to be a must-have, in that it brings you new tracks, new lyrics, and a whole new feeling and sense to how you hear and experience Linkin Park.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I picked the album up a few months ago and it has become one of my most played discs. Norah has it all-the music and lyrics and soulful emotions-and all are well beyond her years.  Most songs are soothing, a few are a little peppy and together, all are a perfect mix.  The piano licks are awesome.  A super album.
B000068TPN|1.0|This movie was for a lack of a better word, horrific. It makes a mockery of those who fought and died, those who suffered, in the Vietnam Conflict. Anyone with even the basest knowledge of the history surrounding the United States involvement in the war, and Ia Drang in paticular, would find this cliched attempt appalling. Be warned, what I will say below may spoil some of the story of this pathetic entry in cinematic history, so read on at your own risk.<br />The Ia Drang battle was the polar oppisite of this depiction. First, no one knew there was NVA in the area; U.S. forces stumbled upon them and radioed for back-up. Moore was not present when the combat began. Even if you put aside this for dramatic purposes, the fact remains that no military operation in that period would be carried out in that fashion. You have no helicopter gunships flying air support; soldiers keep getting shuttled in without any of them making an attempt to set up a perimeter (in fact, a perimeter is never established); you have a Lieutenant Colonel on the front lines instead of establishing a command post and directing his troops (once again, no command center is created in the field during the entire film, and instead of leading, good old Mel is offering support to the wounded; the NVA bunker magically acquires electricity from some magical source without any possible way to logistically and realistically obtain it; you see frontline soldiers with there rifle safetey's on, thus creating suspense when they click them off and start a fire fight (give me a break); death letters are delivered by Yellow Taxi (on a military base *rolls eyes*) by a cab driver through Western Union telegrams, instantaneously from the field of battle, without any positive identification (in reality, casualty notices are delivered by a military officer and a chaplain as many as two weeks after the death); this also gives rise to tension later when a Yellow Taxi pulls up outside Moore's house, and the wife thinks it could be a KIA notice (despite the fact she would know beforehand that her husband was returning and meet him on the airstrip) only to see Moore himself (delivered in a taxi, even though he's a Colonel); On the battlefield, every plane in use during Vietnam delivers airsupport from an aircraft carrier , despite the fact that the battle occurs in the central highlands; heroic charges appear throughout the movie (and they even did this wrong; instead of arraying themselves in a line, they cluster together); the appearence of Aspen and Cottonwood tree's in South Vietnam; and the indisputable fact the U.S lost the battle at the Ia Drang. . .<br />This barely touches the surface. Even beyond the laughable innacurracies, the acting is horrible and cliched (there is not one original concept in this movie). This is a disgrace to those who fought and suffered during the Vietnam war; a laughable mockery of their sacrifice. . .

B000067G3C|4.0|&quot;Speed&quot; looks and feels like it could have been made in the '00s. The 1994 action film has lost none of its velocity. Fox has released Jan De Bont's thriller as part of its high-end Five Star Collection, updated to THX standards. The widescreen images look suitably flashy -- a bit flat in some outdoors shots, but with few signs of age. DTS delivers the audio remix to maximum effect, rear speakers frantically pumping out breaking glass and screeching metal. The Dolby Digital (5.1) track sounds edgy as well, but without DTS' sonic depth.<br />The soft-spoken director De Bont uses the commentary to outline his philosphy of acting for action films, saying that subtle performances just look dumb in frantic movies. A lot of actors are afraid of the perils of action filming, he says. Producer Mark Gordon and writer Graham Yost pack their high-energy, off-the-wall commentary with information. &quot;Speed&quot; would never be green-lit now, they say: &quot;Nobody wants to see a plane blown up.&quot;<br />&quot;Speed's&quot; second disc includes an unusually detailed featurette on stunt coordinator Gary Hymes. He shows admiration for the &quot;very physical&quot; hero Keanau Reeves, who &quot;wanted to do almost everything himself,&quot; including a leap onto the moving bus. Hymes talks about his craft at length, saying he likes to work with a stuntman &quot;who has a good healthy sense of fear.&quot;<br />A visual effects segment breaks down the bus jump sequence (look for the digital birds) and the film's final subway crash, mostly done with models. Multiangle, multicamera views put you in the driver's seat; that's good for an hour or so of DVD remote button pushing.<br />You can buy this in a set with &quot;Speed 2,&quot; but that's a worthless movie. The filmmakers go out of their way to disown it on the &quot;Speed&quot; commentaries.
6303921248|5.0|As any sixteen year old girl who has read this novel, it is one of my all-time favorites.  I expected the movie to be a poor adaption.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie was exactly as I remembered the novel to be.  Every scene and every character was well casted.  Colin Firth is a perfect Mr. Darcy!  I fell so in love with him while watching this movie.  I rented it one night, and I watched it twice in two days.  It's very long, but it seems like it's only 2 hours!  It's like being back in the book again.  It was absolutely brilliant!  I adore this movie, and I will be buying it as soon as possible.  Each time I watch it, I want to start it over and watch it again.  I never get sick of it.  I urge every girl to watch this movie.  It's unbelievable.
0679409920|4.0|Publishing this novel in 1978, Greene says in his autobiography (Ways of Escape, pp. 256  - 257) that he had actually started it ten years earlier, abandoning it when his friend and former colleague, Kim Philby, defected to Russia.  He did not want this book to be considered a roman a clef.  Like Philby, Maurice Castle, the main character in this novel, is a double agent, and Greene goes to great pains to bring him to life and try to make his inevitable defection to Russia believable. Having earlier lived in South Africa, Castle had fallen in love with Sarah, an African woman.  Another double agent had helped her escape from South Africa so she and Castle could be married.  Now living in England with Sarah and their son, Castle continues to provide information to the Russians as payback for the help he received years before.<br /><br />The cloak-and-dagger intrigue here is rooted in the Cold War, and Greene's own sympathies with the Communists, well known, are noticeable throughout the novel.  When a leak is suspected in Castle's section of British intelligence, a secret plan is devised to eliminate the culprit quietly to avoid another Philby-type embarrassment to the government.  It's of only minor consequence to the higher-ups that they kill Davis, an innocent man.  The Russians' rush to \\"save\\" Castle, whose work for them has really been of only minor importance, seems more like wishful thinking than reality.  Codes created from duplicate copies of old books, messages left in a hollow tree, and warning signals made with rings of the telephone now seem to belong to an age much earlier than the mere 24 years which have evolved since the book's publication.<br /><br />Castle is well drawn, for the most part, though he seems a rather clumsy agent-about-to-defect, someone who, though supposedly devoted to his wife and child, has not thought far enough ahead to guarantee their ultimate safety and happiness.  Sarah, unfortunately, is an undifferentiated, flat character, and Castle's devotion to her must be accepted, rather than felt, thereby limiting the impact of the ending.  Parts of the book are very moving, and Castle is often a sympathetic character, but I thought the book lacked the philosophical and structural tightness of his earlier, more famous novels.  Mary Whippleevotion to her must be accepted, rather than felt, thereby limiting the impact of the ending.   Parts of the book are very moving, and Castle is often a sympathetic character, but I thought the book lacked the philosophical and structural tightness of his earlier, more famous novels.

B00005JKLZ|2.0|H.G. Wells story, great cast, big Hollywood budget -- what more could you ask for, right?  A lot, as it turns out.<br />Costumes, historical sets, special effects, and supporting performances were all brilliant.  For a while, in fact, it seemed like this was going to be a good movie.<br />Then it...  drifted...  It drifted into ghastly political correctness.  It drifted into sets that didn't seem plausible with the story line, and less-than-stunning monster effects (where's Rick Baker when you need him?).  Then it ended with a huge, ridiculous, totally unbelievable twist that must have H.G. Wells rolling over in his grave.<br />What can I say?  Read the book.

0451163540|5.0|So far as captivating page-turners go, few writers of popular fiction can top Ken Follett when he is at his best, and though I've not read all his novels, I definitely consider Triple (a political thriller) to be one of the best of those I've read.  (Other favourites of mine are A Dangerous Fortune and The Third Twin--and I am eager to read The Pillars of the Earth).  <br />Briefly (and without giving anything away), the plot centres around three secret agents--one from Israel's Mossad, one from Russia's KGB, and one from Egypt's Intelligence Agency.  It involves the arms race between the Israelis and the Arabs and takes place in 1968.  I really can say no more other than to mention that one of these groups has an idea for ensuring that it remains a competitor in that race, and the method the agent has for bringing that idea to fruition (and this is what the novel is all about) is complex and really quite ingenious.  <br />Stripped to its most basic level, this could be said to be something of a cat and mouse story.  However, there is so very much more to it than that, for Follett is a master storyteller who not only excels in deftly handling relationships between individuals (no mean feat in itself!) but is simply brilliant at creating characters that the reader cares about and hence in writing novels that one hates to reach the end of.    <br />Though not a light read, this novel is certainly enlightening.  I, for one, learned a fair bit about Middle Eastern politics and something about nuclear weaponry.  Further, I felt Follett did a splendid job of conveying the political situation from the points of view of both the Israelis and the Palestinians in a manner that simultaneously evoked both sympathy for and censure of both sides.  It's a sensitive topic (perhaps even more so now than in 1979 when the novel was first published) and one in which Follett's skill as a writer really shines through.<br />Highly recommended to fans of Ken Follett in general, to fans ofthe spy genre in particular, and to anyone who enjoys a consumately written (and insightful) thriller!
B00006G8G1|5.0|The only flaw on this DVD is the absence of at least 1 song from Somewhere In Time. Other than that every aspect of this DVD is superb. The picture and sound quality are the best you will find anywhere. Having been dissapointed with Maidens, \\"Raising Hell\\" DVD, and still hoping for \\"Live After Death\\" on DVD, This fills my Maiden DVD void. The show from beginning to end is packed full of energy. The Huge crowd singing word for word throughout only adds to the exitement and energy level. Disc 2 is a great bonus to the show. Seeing the band in an every day setting makes me respect these guys even more. Great to see them all care so much about their fans. All in all A GREAT DVD from A bunch of down to earth guys who just happen to be possibly the best Metal band of all time, especially LIVE...
B00005N53P|5.0|Brilliant, simply brilliant. That is the word to describe this album. I was so impressed with it. Hearing &quot;last nite&quot; got me interested, hearing &quot;New York City Cops&quot; got me intrigued and listening to this album got me hooked! Lyrics and music is incredible. From &quot;soma&quot;, &quot;hard to explain&quot;, &quot;take it or leave it&quot; and every other song on this album, you'll go on a journey you are unlikely to want to return from. <BR>Warning: Material on this album can be addictive.

0316666343|3.0|What is it about some books that begin like gang busters and end up making you wish that you were watching television instead...just so that you could kick the screen in!<BR>I loved the very beginning--it was chilling and horrible.  I grew up in those Brady Bunch-esque days and I could identify with the times....YET not so far into the book, it falls off and becomes close to ridiculous and far too Casper the Friendly Ghost.  <BR>[spoiler]<BR>I could go on and on and probably shouldn't.<BR>I liked the whole notion of the book and thought that it was a unique concept, but too many things just didn't make sense.

B00006CXSS|5.0|*sigh* I knew it was coming, every time a war movie is made in the US the \\"USA bashing\\" is unleashed by our British lads.  Yes Britain had a signifigant role in winning WWII, nobody has said otherwise in any of these films.  But to bash on the US and \\"Band of Brothers\\" simply becasue there wasn't enough Bristish lads in it, well that's just sour grapes.  And let's address some of your blanket statments about US war films not portraying the British involvement in the war-(begin quote)\\"like many Brits I do find it quite annoying that all of these films portray the superhuman American's single-handedly sweeping all before them as they triumphantly storm all the way from Normandy, through France, Belgium and Holland and then finally into the Ruhr valley.\\" (end of quote) Well obviously you have not rented, \\"A Bridge too Far,\\" \\"Guns of Navarone,\\" \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" \\"Bridge Over the River Quai,\\" \\"Patton,\\" \\"The Longest Day,\\" and others, or even the at- times-inaccurate \\"Pearl Harbor\\" movie with Ben Afleck (sp?). Well you get the point, in all of these films I've just named, the British contributions to the war effort were a primary focus within the movie, even if the movies were released here in the US.  Just because two war movies that you review \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Band Of Brothers\\" do not include British exploits, please do not make blanket statements about the US film industry.  Besides, \\"Band of Brothers\\" was about the 101st, not the British 1st Airborne Divison's \\"Red Devils,\\" therefore not many British faces make their way into the battle scenes because they never fought together anyway.  The closest the 101st came to fighting together with the British was fighting with the XXX Corps tanks, which was portrayed in the Market Garden episode.<br />Well as I'm sure you have read a \\"Bridge Too Far\\" by Cornelius Ryan and know that the \\"Red Devils\\" took and held the Arnhem Bridge while waiting for the XXX Corps to arrive.  Your quote- \\"Nobody is denying that the 101st and 506th Airborne divisions weren't involved, they were. But they didn't play the pivotal role by any means.\\" (end of quote) What book did you read?  If you understand the battle at all you'd know that the 101st took the bridge at Son, and the 82nd took the bridge at Nijmegan with substantial casualties, two of the three major bridges needed for victory were taken by US forces.  How can you say that the US had no \\"pivotal role?\\"  And wasn't it your XXX Corps that stopped short of Arnhem and relief for the \\"Red devils\\" because they were brewing tea and waiting for infantry support?  The 82nd airborne pleaded with the XXX Corps to take their tanks into Arnhem and relieve their British paratrooper brothers, but it wasn't too be.  You did read the book didn't you?  My point is this, before you rip on US movies and the US in general, please get your facts straight.  Also, there were no British in Saving Private Ryan because Omaha beach was stormed by the US First Infantry Division, not the British, who were busy at Juno, Gold, and Sword beaches with the Canadians, and were ordered to take Caen, far away from the US axis of advance, therefore they weren't fighting together.  Good heavens man, we're not scared of the truth, but at least try to get your facts straight.  Oh yeah, I give Band of Brothers 5 stars. ;)  And Great Britain, I love ya, but take it easy on the US bashing, let's take off our Doc's, drink some tea, watch Mr. Bean together and relax.
B000069HKH|3.0|I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen since before I could drive. I really looked farward to this reunion with the E-Street Band but have come away disappointed. This collection of songs simply does not reach the heights to which it aspires. Yes, it captures much of the sense of loss from 9-11 but so do many other efforts out there. And, frankly, I guess we've come to expect more from Springsteen. May not be fair on him but there it is. I kept trying to find Clarence on this record --- where is he? &quot;meet me at Mary's place&quot; comes closest to finding the --- yes I hate to say it--- old E-Street groove and you can almost hear the saxophone... My city in ruin is a fitting tribute and a stirring song --- one of the fiercest things he has done, but sadly the rest of the record falls behind...
0060245867|5.0|This is the first of several of this type and clearly the best of the group. the rhythm and flow of the pages are wonderful.  The illustrations are absolutely terrific, you can just feel this little mouse's enthusiasm and hear the little boy telling the story.  I love this story, my kids want to hear it over and over again.
B00005ALP6|5.0|This film is a classic.  Possibly one of the greatest films you will ever see.  The characters are beautiful and Audrey Hepburn simply shines as Eliza Doolittle.  Rex Harrison plays an excellent portrayal of the gruff yet loveable Henry Higgins.  The music gets in your head and you'll be singing it for hours after.  One of the greatest if not the greatest musical of all time.
B000002L9B|4.0|Upon hearing the lush opening track, &quot;Christopher Tracy's Parade,&quot; one might think Parade is a continuation and slight variation of Around The World In A Day.  Well, that assessment is accurate, as evidenced by the lush backing vocals by Wendy And Lisa, who figure more prominently in accompanying vocals than in any Prince album, strings, and psychedelic sounds.<br />It's on songs like &quot;New Position&quot; that the is accompanied by a funky bass beat along with the bell-like synthesizers.  The beat slows down towards the end, with the sounds of laughter seguing into &quot;I Wonder U.&quot;<br />&quot;Under The Cherry Moon,&quot; also the title to Prince's second movie, is a slow ballad with piano accompaniment.  While it's not bad, Prince would record a similar but improved cousin on Sign 'O' The Times, &quot;Slow Love.&quot;<br />Things get more upbeat with the next two songs:  &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; and &quot;Life Can Be So Nice.&quot;  The first incorporates funk elements on a synthesizer and beat while maintaining the thematic lushness introduced on the first song.  The chorus is accompanied by a catchy rhythm:  &quot;I love u baby, I love u so much/Maybe we can stay in touch/Meet me in another world, space and joy/Vous etes tres belle, mama, girls &amp; boys.&quot;  Sheila E. helps out on backing vocals and cowbells on &quot;Life Can Be So Nice.&quot;  It features the lyric, &quot;Nobody plays the clarinet the way you play my heart.&quot;<br />Following the piano instrumental interlude &quot;Venus De Milo&quot; comes the best song on the album:  &quot;Mountains.&quot;  That underrated classic begins with a heavy synth drums, followed by a gaggle of instruments and a majestic horns towards the end.  Prince sings in his falsetto here, accompanied by backing vocals by Wendy and Lisa, who sing, &quot;It's only mountains/there's nothing greater/you and me.&quot;  Fantasy images come into mind with the psychedelic sound.<br />After the slow leisurely stroll of &quot;Do U Lie?&quot; comes &quot;Kiss.&quot;  Now don't get me wrong--&quot;Kiss&quot; is arguably one of Prince's best singles.  I mean that tight funky synthesizer's so irresistible, but its presence here is somewhat oddball, considering the other songs.  It's like finding a chocolate Easter egg among one's jelly babies--different but good all the same.  That is followed by the third single, &quot;Anotherloverholenyohead,&quot; a piece of strident and mid-paced funk-psychedelia.<br />And &quot;Sometimes It Snows In April,&quot; accompanied by piano and mellow guitar, is one of the saddest and best ballads Prince has ever performed.  In it, the character of Tracy has died.  It's tragic beauty is such that its 6:50 running time is not a debit.  It might as well be a somber postscript to the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; song.  The chorus goes:  &quot;Sometimes it snows in April/sometimes I feel so bad, so bad/sometimes I wish that life was neverending/but all goods they say never last.&quot;<br />Part of what makes this album appealing is its closeness to Around The World In A Day.  The psychedelia from that album has been mixed with the funk of Dirty Mind.  Most of the songs are laid-back so nothing like Controversy or 1999 here, which means it wasn't that radio-friendly, but sometimes, albums like this can be great without pandering to radio.ly stroll of &quot;Do U Lie?&quot; comes &quot;Kiss.&quot;  Now don't get me wrong--&quot;Kiss&quot; is arguably one of Prince's best singles.

B000068TPN|4.0|This movie was a good translation of the book to film, although a little dramatic license was taken. A lot of other reviews encourage Rambo and Missing in Action. If you're as mindless as the reviewer's, and wish to wallow in ignorance instead of trying to visualize the reality of the Vietnam war, then by all means these films are for you. This was based on a true story, not fluff fiction, and it captured the chaotic reality of combat, and more importantly the dawn of modern helicopter warfare.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Somewhere between PRETTY HATE MACHINE's pop sensibility and THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL's visionary industrial rock smarts, mastermind Trent Reznor got a little angry...and BROKEN was his 33+ minutes of letting you know he's not gonna take it. Perhaps it was heavy, and perhaps it was loud, but you know it's one of the best eps Trent ever released (FIXED is a wonderful piece as well).<br />\\"Pinion\\" builds in the course of over a minute with sinister guitar notes and creepy and atmospheric background soundscapes. \\"Wish\\" pummels with so much fury, and the angst of Reznor's lyrics are as real as the anger you feel from not only his vocals, but the fast-pace and drilling guitars. \\"Last\\" kicks just as hard, with it's ferocious riffs and hard-hitting rhythms. All of the anger is broken by the brief, nearly 2 minutes of \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\". What's more astounding is how the ending of this interlude is completely blasted away by the in-your-face monster that is \\"Happiness In Slavery\\", the intro just gives you the chills. However, it's one catchy hard rock song. The ep finishes with the last \\"listed\\" track \\"Gave Up\\", which is reminiscent of the pace that \\"Wish\\" excels at. <br />Included are two hidden tracks, \\"Physical (You're So)\\", #98, and \\"Suck\\", #99. \\"Physical\\" is an Adam Ant cover, done metallic style by Reznor and co., and \\"Suck\\" is a live favorite of many NIN fans. I think it brings BROKEN to a fitting end.<br />BROKEN was the little baby boy that threw a temper tantrum, and Trent Reznor, the genius behind the masterpiece child, made BROKEN for all those NIN fans hungry for a harder edge. It was also a hint of what was to come with THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL and THE FRAGILE. Even with the title of this ep, Reznor was anything but broken; he created brilliance with anger.
0156711427|5.0|With all due respect to Rudyard Kipling, E.M. Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" seems likely to remain the definitive novel about British Imperialist India written by an Englishman.  It does not merely see India as a picturesque land in which to set an exotic adventure, but examines the complicated relationships between the British and the Indians with penetrating wisdom, astuteness, and fairness.  Forster is not shy about portraying the British attitude towards the Indians as one of bigotry and condescension, but he also notes the considerable cultural and religious conflicts between the Muslims and the Hindus.   <br />Most of the action takes place in a city called Chandrapore and concerns the friendship between a British school principal named Cyril Fielding and a Muslim physician named Dr. Aziz.  The novel's events are set in motion in an empty mosque, where a praying Aziz meets an elderly Englishwoman named Mrs. Moore.  After some friendly conversation, they take a liking to each other, and Aziz learns that Mrs. Moore's son is a man he knows well -- Ronny Heaslop, the Magistrate of Chandrapore.  Later, having tea at Fielding's house, Aziz meets Mrs. Moore again and her companion, a young lady named Adela Quested, who is vaguely affianced to Ronny.  Eager to see the \\"real\\" India, Adela enthusiastically accepts Aziz's offer to go on a picnic to the Marabar caves, a nearby tourist attraction, and Mrs. Moore is convinced to accompany them.<br />Forster lavishly describes the journey to the caves -- by train and then elephant -- and the caves themselves, each of which apparently is shaped somewhat like a frying pan, with a short corridor ending in a circular chamber.  The outing proves to be much more eventful than the three spelunkers expected.  Mrs. Moore, haunted by the eerie echos the caves propagate, crosses the threshold of insanity.  And upon their return to Chandrapore, Adela claims that she was sexually assaulted in one of the caves and accuses Aziz, who is consequently arrested and tried for the crime.  <br />Of course, there are a few different explanations for what really happened to Adela in the caves, but the British are prejudicially biased against Aziz.  This puts Fielding in a quandary, as his defense of his good friend Aziz infuriates his British compatriots and gets him kicked out of his club.  When Adela later admits that she can't confirm Aziz's guilt, Ronny acknowledges that a retraction of the charges would embarrass the British; he even hustles his mother out of India because, as a witness, her increasing incoherence would damage the case for the prosecution.   <br />Although the cave incident and the subsequent trial drive the plot, the novel is more about the clash of three headstrong societies (Muslim, Hindu, and Christian) forced to dwell together amidst political turmoil, and how certain members of these societies manage to reconcile themselves to each other's differences.  The final scene between Fielding and Aziz, in which Aziz uncannily predicts an independent Indian nation resulting from British dissolution, is a poignant display of this theme; for all the trouble and conflict in the world, there is always room for friendship and understanding.
B00005J9ZB|5.0|I kinda just stumbled onto these guys, good thing for me too, i was shopping around for other cd's at a local music store, when i found this cd i was like whoa they have is cd, i wasn't looking for it but i did remember reading the reviews of a few others for this and other ayreon cd's, anyways i was surprised they had it and having no will power at all to resist the temptaion to buy it since i'm very impulsive and addicted to new and different music i took it(i bought and payed for it), as well as the other cd's i went there for, I put it in my car cd player right away and didn't take it out till i got only to keep playing it from where i left off. I was blown away by everything on this cd,  It's diverse in music styles, it's long, the whole concept theme of the 2 cd's is interesting to say  the least. This is a very good progressive album i recommend this to anyone. if u want to know more either buy it or read Joe whites, or Lord Chimps reviews, they will go into more detail then me and just simply know more about this type of music and then me.
0786915749|5.0|After reading the Dragon Prince and Dragon Star series, I was looking forward to the Chronicles series. I was very excited to read this series because I use to play the old rpgs such as Dark Queen and Death Knights and Heroes of the Lance. This book itself confirmed that Hickman and Weis know what they are writing about. I hope every book they write in Dragon Lance is as good as this one. From the beginning the action never stopped. While the companions search the ancient city for the only hope humans have left in finding the gods.
0743424425|5.0|I first saw the movie based on this book at age seven, and finally read the book itself at twelve.  Despite my opinions concerning The Stand as being King's masterpiece, The Shining still remains a personal favorite of mine.<br />The book focuses on the breakdown of a particular family isolated within a genuine example of the archetypal Bad Place.  Jack Torrance, a struggling writer with a shaky past of alcoholism, unemployment, and a mercurial temper, obtains the position of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a mountain lodge illustrious enough to shadow its more tenebrous and gory history.  The Overlook's history, while providing the subterranean forces contributing to this breakdown, is especially manifested to Torrance's five-year-old son, Danny, who possesses an awesome power enabling him to see these forces through images of the hotel's past.  Wendy, the mother in this family, is initially oblivious to the hotel's nature, but ultimately stands torn between her love for her husband and her care for her son.  Eventually, Danny himself becomes a pawn as his father becomes progressively influenced and corrupted by the Overlook.<br />This book is one of King's finest and he uses his well-esteemed finesse brilliantly in portraying the ulterior currents in not only the hotel, but also within Jack's and Danny's respective minds.  If you have only seen the movie (Kubrick version), I strongly recommend reading the book; in my opinion, the movie was lacking and did not touch on the finer points King presented.  I don't believe you'll be disappointed.
0748662731|5.0|Here are some of my favorite things about TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE:<br />It contains a little bit of interesting African history, personalities, views and culture introduced in a creative way as we read about Mma (pronounced MA) Ramotswe who goes about her daily life and solves cases in Botswana.<br />There are wonderful passages that cast a different light on Africa - they bring out positive lessons about the continent and its people.  I loved passages like this one found on page 55 (Chapter Six - A Dry Place):<br />&quot;Then there was Mr. Mandela.  Everybody knew about Mr. Mandela and how he had forgiven those who had imprisoned him.  They had taken away years and years of his life simply because he wanted justice.  They had set him to work in a quarry and his eyes had been permanently damaged by the rock dust.  But at last, when he had walked out of the prison on that breathless, luminous day, he had said nothing about revenge or even retribution.  He had said that there were more important things to do than to complain about the past, and in time he had shown that he meant this by hundreds of acts of kindness towards those who had treated him so badly.  That was the real African way, the tradition that was closest to the heart of Africa.  We are all children of Africa, and none of us is better or more important than the other.  This is what Africa could say to the world:  it could remind it what it is to be human.&quot;<BR>     <BR>I'm tickled by some of the story details, such as the names of the businesses in the book  -- Mothobani Bookkeeping Services:  Tell the Taxman to Go Away; Make Me Beautiful Salon; Honest Deal Butchery; Judgment-day Jewellers.  Of course, let's not forget The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency!  Love those names.  <br />TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE is full of special narrative touches that are unexpected, humorous, serious, enlightening, mysterious and moving like &quot;The Boy with an African Heart,&quot; a missing American boy.  The solutions to some of the problems are fitting.  <br />Fafa Demasio
B000003TAR|5.0|Hey, it may be no Led Zepplin, but they still are a classic. Their next cd after Nevermind but still seems they made the music for making music and not for the money... unlike Korn or Limp Bizkit. This cd comes with one of the greatest songs Heart Shaped Box. If you love Nirvana then you definatly NEED this cd, but even if you just think they're ok, YOU STILL NEED THIS CD!
B000001FS3|5.0|The title I have given my review is redundant at best, as anyone with any sense of perspective will accept U2's fifth studio recording as a masterwork...  Both in the frame of reference of the time of its' release and of its' significance as a work of art that was the template for many bands to come.<br />From the rising crescendo of &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; to the decay at the end of &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;, this album/CD resonates into the new millenium as being as outstanding and relevant as it was &quot;in its' day&quot;.  It stands up against anything released by anyone in the last thirty years...  And rather favorably at that.  This album alone guarantees U2's place in rock 'n' roll history.<br />All of the above that I've written is as obvious as the nose on your face, and I wouldn't have even bothered reviewing this (should I go back and give &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; a positive review while I'm at it!?), but I stumbled across the comically foolish review of this record that immediately precedes mine.  I hope those with above room-temperature IQ's can recognize the mind-bending insanity of statements such as &quot;the lyrics don't make any sense&quot; and &quot;any band that's not been on MTV's Total Request Live can't play&quot; and so on and so forth.  My oh my how I'd love to see any of today's bands put on a concert with anything approaching U2's skill and intensity...  If, of course, any of them can play their own instruments and sing without a bank of digital effects to make them sound like they CAN sing (can you say &quot;Britney Spears&quot;?).<br />For anyone who actually needs to read a review of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; by now, 15 years after its' release, to decide whether or not to buy it...  Well I give it six stars.  Shame one can only award it five.
B00000I0XW|4.0|I first stumbled over Sarah Brightman when I became a &quot;Phantom&quot; fan. In which she was the first actress/singer to play the part of Christine, the lead female role. After taking a liking to her voice from my recording of this famous Broadway musical, I decided to invest in more Sarah Brightman merchandise. This CD was one of the first things I bought, both because it was her singing and it was all Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs. <BR>         At first, I loved it. I listened to it all the time and told all my friends that Sarah Brightman was the best, current female singer I'd ever heard. Songs that'd I'd never heard before --like, Tell Me On a Sunday and Love Changes Everything-- became favorites after hearing Sarah's versions. But, things change, I got both older and wiser and discovered flaws in this CD which I once worshiped. <BR>         Sarah's voice is amazing, I won't argue that and wouldn't even want to, but it's classically trained and a lot of the songs she chose to sing on this particularly CD are not good for an operatic voice. Another Suitcase in Another Hall is one of the best examples. She sounds great, but the song sounds bizarre with her in the lead vocals. <BR>         In fact, she even falters with songs meant for a classical voice. Memory -- a song from Cats, which is sung best by Betty Buckley -- sounds irregularly high pitched and shrill when sung by Sarah. <BR>         I wouldn't say: &quot;Don't buy this at all, it's nothing but a disappointment.&quot; But I would tell Sarah Brightman fans that are debating between this one and another CD to go with the other one. When we're talking in terms of musicals, Sarah's voice only excels in a part written specifically for her (Christine in &quot;Phantom&quot;) and she should consider sticking solely with Opera outside of roles like this.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Freud suggested that dreams contained a sort of censor which cloaked disturbing thoughts from awakening us.

Finally that is not even enough as the reality of what has happened and what she has done invades the dreams of the now jaded young Canadian.  Only the ultimate &quot;silenzio&quot; can end the perturbation...she hopes.<br />Of course, this movie should have gotten the Oscar for Best Film and the Oscar for Best Actress...but, of course, it didn't<br />Thomas
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series, originally aired on HBO, represents the best in film making and is a true tribute to a group of guys, soldiers, (heroes, really) training to be Airborne, becoming Airborne and as apart of Easy Company, basically helping to save the free world.  A true story.<br />If you enjoyed \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" as I did, you will truly be awed by these ten episodes about a group of men from the \\"Greatest Generation.\\"<br />Excellence in film making.
B000069HKH|5.0|Not that those who'll read this will care or should, I feel it's necessary to call myself a Springsteen snob, one of those who looks down at most if not all of his \\"post-Darkness\\" work. I grew up on the Jersey Shore and caught Springsteen, Southside Johnny and all their contemporaries at the start. I realized several years later that the musicians I would hear rehearsing across the street from my grandparents' house was in fact Bruce and Co. because that was where Billy Rush, former lead guitarist of the Asbury Jukes lived. After hearing the hype for The Rising, I didn't pay a whole lot of attention. I've never had much interest in hearing the raves of the Bruce bandwagoners (again my snoberry. I apologize). However, this album lives up to everything that I've read and heard. It's fantastic, the best stuff the E Streeters have done in over twenty years. With each listen it gets better and better. The variety of sounds, the haunting lyrics and the \\"freshness\\" of production make this an addictive work. The theme of \\"rising\\" brilliantly repeats itself over and over and the events of 9/11 have not yet been as eloquently expressed as they are in this album. It will make you feel wistful, introspective and perhaps most importantly, somewhat optimistic. It also is just great rock and roll, certainly a rarity today. Really a must have along with the first four albums!!!!
B00005NWM3|4.0|I am a new Nickelback listener so I cannot tell you about their development as a band up to this point, but I can tell you that this CD is a terrific CD and has really led them to be listened to by a larger audience. I am sure that most people who listen to contemporary music and even those who don't have heard their sond How You Remind Me and Too Bad. These are two great songs, definitely enough reason to buy this CD. But there are many other good songs on it also such as harder ones like When I Woke Up This Morning and Nevermind. Admittedly they're are a seemingly extraneous songs, but overall the CD is a teriffic CD.
B000002HH2|5.0|Post is Bjork's sophomore album. It is also her most popular album, which is something I don't like too much as I suspect that the only reason for that is the number of singles that it spawned, but popularity equals recognition &amp; Post most definitely deserves recognition. Polishing Debut's weaker corners (Not that there were many) it is almost entirely an electronica album (With the exception of &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; &amp; &quot;You've Been Flirting Again&quot;), a musical genre Bjork has always excelled in. Working with Nellee Hooper &amp; Talvin Singh again couldn't have been a bad choice &amp; collaborating with Tricky for two songs only made things better. Naturally, the album shines with highlights:- For now my favourite is &quot;Army Of Me&quot;, the first song:- A bass oriented piece of techno with one of the best choruses ever written, musically &amp; lyrically:- &quot;&amp; if you complain once more you'll meet an army of me&quot;. My second favourite is &quot;I Miss You&quot;, a great song about the human need of love, no matter who conveys it in which Talvin concocts an inexplicable rhythm for an uninvited trumpet to join in later. The two most prominent songs on the album however are the epics &quot;Hyper-Ballad&quot; &amp; &quot;Isobel&quot;:- The former being a triphop ballad narrative which allegorically describes the appalling instinct for self destruction just to reassure ourselves; The latter being a quaint tale that I just can't explain, you've gotta hear it. Some other songs I liked were &quot;Enjoy&quot;, &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;, &quot;Cover Me&quot; &amp; of course the familiar &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;, the only song here Bjork didn't write so I assume it's a cover but nobody can remember now.
0375707972|2.0|First of all, I never found any connection between the part of the book where Hanna and Michael are having a deeply sexual relationship and the part where she is on trial. I know that Michael ties it together with illiteracy, but to me that seems weak. I also didn't understand Michael's having an obsession with Hanna, which was not always sexual, for all those years. At the end something did seem to be showing a deeper message but I don't understand it still. The language kind of confused me, but it's really not that difficult. I don't know, see if you can understand this book or just enjoy it.
B000002NFM|5.0|Before we begin the review, let's get one thing straight - Liam Howlett is a genius. A genius! Okay, now that we've said that, let's get on with the review.<BR>  The Fat of the Land is the title for Prodigy's third album. What we have here is an incredible array of sound and walls of noise from none other than synth master Liam Howlett himself. This man has got rythm down. He knows how to make you move. This is the record that will have you bouncing off the walls. However, this time around, Liam has been wise enough to utilize talents from other people. This means a more vocal, dare we say \\"rock\\" oriented approach on several of the songs.<BR> This album sold a lot of copies. It is, to my knowledge, the fastest-selling record of all time.<BR> Why, one might ask, did the record sell so much? Because it's good. Plain and simple. Let's look at some of the songs.<BR> First off, this album, while good musically, has some songs that were controversial. These include the first track, \\"Smack,\\" and \\"Firestarter.\\" Say what you will on these songs. \\"Smack\\" uses a rap sample from the group Ultramagnetic MC's. \\"Firestarter\\" is about Keith Flint and his manic zaniness.<BR> The first track, \\"Smack,\\" features a propulsive beat, nice bass, nice sound, it's all nice. It's hard and in-your-face. The song breaks down to feature an Indian vocalist. This is a cohesive, memorable track.<BR> The second track, \\"Breathe,\\" was, to me upon first listen, quite confrontational. It features Maxim (the Prodigy's MC) and Keith Flint on vocals. This song is about drug psychosis. However, you don't need to know that to enjoy it... This one will get you moving. This was one of the two hit singles on this album (\\"Breathe\\" and \\"Firestarter.\\") The vocals on this song have been likened to the Sex Pistols, and they are somewhat similar. The beat is fast and crazy.<BR> \\"Diesel Power\\" is a rap number with, also, a really nice beat, and Kool Keith (also known as Dr. Octagon) on vocals. A nice song, but not quite as memorable to me.<BR> \\"Funky Sh**\\" is a fast techno thriller. It has a menacing sound, and includes well-used samples, such as a disco sample.<BR> \\"Mindfields\\" is an excellent song with a slightly Japanese feel, a really nice rap sort of beat, and nice electronic effects.<BR> \\"Narayan\\" is perhaps one of my favorite songs on this album. It has Crispian Mills, from the band Kula Shaker, on vocals, but the charm of this song lies in Liam Howlett's production and orchestration. This is an Eastern sounding number, but it's really quite hard-hitting... It even has a spooky piano line, and the whole thing sounds kind of emotional. At some points in the track you feel like you are being sonically whipped. Mind-bending.<BR> And then there's \\"Firestarter,\\" a stomper and burner of a track, with Keith Flint's manic British accent vocal delivery. Has a good beat, good guitar, good vocals. A good cohesive track. This was the second of the two hit singles.<BR> Climbatize was the last song Liam made for the album. It's an instrumental track, with a Middle Eastern feel. It's good, but not one of my favorites. They played it on the commercial for the Tomb Raider movie...<BR> The album ends on somewhat of a surprise note - a cover of an L7 song. This song is very \\"thrashy,\\" and almost purely rock. It has electronic effects, but is in essense a thrash rock song. So-so. My sister liked it.<BR> In my opinion, about the only thing this album has against it, and what keeps me from listening to it as much as Music for the Jilted Generation (Prodigy's second album) is the lack of variety in it. Some of the songs can sound a little too similar, even though they are all good. Also, the album as a whole is pretty hard-hitting, and maybe could have used a few \\"breathers,\\" as well. After a while it may begin to grate on you.<BR> However, despite the harsh, urban, underground, hardcore feel of the album, there lies a beauty in it, a deep beauty, and one that has stayed with me and not left me. A lot of work went into this album, and it shows. When I put the cd into the cd player and let it play, it's pure sonic bliss. In fact, often just by putting it in, I find I may end up listening to the whole album - it's that cohesive. Each track is well-made, and they fit together and flow nicely.<BR> My second favorite Prodigy album, after Music for the Jilted Generation. Excellent production. If you like rock, chances are you will like this album. If you like a variety of music, such as rock and hip hop, chances are even higher that you will like it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|As a victim of the Virgin Megastore listening booth (again) I must say that Norah had me with the first track. I didn't listen to the rest til I got home and what a treat! Her silky vocals do not match her youthfulness. A good mood enhancer.  With the exception of a few lightweight tracks, i would definitely deem this a neccessary purchase.
0785773401|5.0|This was my first Asimov book. I thought it was very well written. I wasn't sure what to expect going in because I have heard so much about Isaac Asimov. Naked Sun was very entertaining. I must admit that I was sucked into the whodunnit of the book, however. I was intrigued also by the difference in cultures between the eartman and the spacers. It was interesting to see how they reacted to each other. A book like this parallels todays world in which every city has someone who was not born there, who is a sort of outsider and must adjust to the norms of that society or not adhere and pave a path for him or herself. Naked Sun will definately make me read more of Asimov.
0312955006|5.0|The Concrete Blond is the Bosch novel we've been waiting on.  This one has something for everyone.  It has the legal/courtroom suspence, it's a classic who-done-it, and it has all the plot twists a reader could want.  Connelly takes all these components and expertly wraps them up into a very tight plot.  This book would be excellent as a stand alone, but it is also key in the series.  It answers a lot of questions raised in the first two books about Bosch's past.<br />This one is my favorite Connelly book so far, and I highly recommend it to any mystery/suspence fans.  It can be read as a stand alone, but I think it was much better after having first read The Black Echo and the Black Ice.<br />Also recommended: anything by Michael Connelly (Blood Work); Greg Iles (Dead Sleep, 24 Hours); Nelson DeMille (Plum Island, The Lions Game); Jeffery Deaver (The Devil's Teardrop, The Bone Collector); or T. Jefferson Parker (The Blue Hour, Red Light).
B000069CWE|5.0|Wow! this is not just a remix it is like having a whole new album, I first saw the new video on Vh1 and I thought Linkin Park had a new cd out ( actually in a way it is ) I really like the work they have done with this, especially on the tracks &quot;with you&quot; and &quot;pts of atharty&quot;  and &quot;Krawling&quot;, being a huge stabbing westward fan it almost reminds me of their stuff. So I highly recommend this cd, mind you it is heavy but with a rock and roll flavour to it , I loved it.
0783235666|2.0|I've read some of the other reviews on here, and from what I've seen NO ONE has complained about the horrible ending. Why? Because there is no ending!! Hitchcock usually manages to find a way to explain everything in his movies. In Psycho the Psychiatrist told the whole story; in Vertigo it was all revealed in the end and in Rear Window the crime is solved. But The Birds' unfinished ending was HORRIBLE. If you're a person who needs closure (like me) this is not the movie for you.<br />Some who have NOT seen the movie, may be bothered by my revealing the movie's lack of ending. But I promise that I'm giving NOTHING away. Even if I sat here and told you the whole ending it detail, you wouldn't believe me and would have to check it out for yourself. So don't worry. I am spoiling nothing. (Because there is nothing to spoil!!)
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is the best of Tom's works so far.  Well, I am wrong.  This is one of his best works so far.  Mr. Hanks had grown in to a real actor.
0312265859|2.0|I have enjoyed this series of books enormously until Hard Eight.  The new characters were not interesting or well developed.  The romance was minimal.  The story wrapped up way too quickly.  This was a very unsatisfying book that would not have stood up on its own if I had not read the previous seven.
6305648522|5.0|Soft, gentle, wonderful...  This movie is full of poetry, music and love.  Everyone feels tears.
B000063V8S|4.0|This is my favorite season of 'the next generation'.  It is compiled with episodes that are entertaining, edifying and provokative-almost all that you want in a sci fi show.  Patrick Stewart gives a brilliant performance, truely finding the heart of his character with poingant monologues; he inspiringly gives life to the decisions that his character makes.  Enjoy the show that brought science fiction back into our regularly schedualed tv viewing.
6305358613|5.0|It is not easy to make a perfect movie but they did it.  I give it a five.
B000067FP8|4.0|When I was a child, very young, four or five, or maybe a little older, but not much, I was obsessed with the original Gremlins, I loved it, and was frightened by it. It's amazing how easy it is to frighten a little child with a movie that seems so... silly now. To this day I am still a huge fan of the two Gremlins movies. However the second is definitely my favorite of the two. Why? Simple, it took the comical elements of the first one to the extreme. While Gremlins was meant to be a B-movie, this is meant to be a comedy. Gremlins was simply too good of a movie to become the B-Movie that they had hoped for. Instead it became a classic of dark comedy, which is good because B-Movies don't get the recognition they deserve.<br /> I don't know why there was a drastic change of direction with the sequel, but I was grateful for it because I'm a huge fan of high comedy in the vein of Monty Python, Zucker movies, and well... this! If you're looking for a horror movie look elsewhere. This movie is as zany as silly monster movies get! The movie also features some impressive pre-CGI special effects, for its day, and the puppets were quite well done. All in all if you have not seen this movie I highly recommend at least giving it a rent because I'm pretty sure that most people would enjoy it, although probably much more so if they have seen the original.
6305736650|5.0|What a love story and it still works.  Classic is always a classic.
B000007R1M|5.0|After having heard all albums by Kraftwerk except *The Mix* now, I'm having a real trouble in trying to decide which is the best of Kraftwerk, *Man-Machine* (this album) or *Trans-europe Express*, which is another great album. But I would say, with a great hesitation, that it's Trans-europe Express because of its more innovative and experimental character. In *Man-Machine*, it's obvious that Kraftwerk's highly original approach to music was getting mature: tunes in this album are all enjoyable and masterful at the same time (My favorite tune is Man-Machine). They show no stretch (and therefore less tension). This point is important because I have to admit some tunes in *Trans-europe* could be boring.<br />In comparison, *Computer World*, yet another great album, seems to me to be a bit placed behind of *Trans-europe* and *Man-Machine*, though it has much in common with *Man-Machine*, and some tunes, e.g., *Pocket Calculator*, *Numbers*, are truly enjoyable.<br />Most recordings of Kraftwerk are really benefiting from remastered CD releases. You can now easily recognize awesome details they maneuvered that I suspect were not reasonably accessible with vinyl-based reproduction device....
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is scary, but good.  Very good.
B000002LQR|5.0|If you dont already own this then your probably in the minority. If you own \\"Californication\\" then im sure you would still like this, although it has a slightly less comercial sound it is still very enjoyable and easy to listen to.<br />As far as im concerned it is also way better than \\"Californication\\", which i felt really didnt have anything new, catchy or interesting after track 5. \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" however has songs from beginning to end that are different and keep you listening. Starting with the wonderful \\"The Power of Equality\\" and flowing straight into \\"If You Had To Ask\\" the cd starts off with a seemingly 10 minute long song (bet you cant pick the change from the first to second song the first time you listen to it). From there it goes into a couple of singles (#3 and #5) before the acoustic guitar of \\"I Could Have Lied\\" comes on (one of my all time favourite songs). The middle of the album contains more singles and well know songs (#9, #10 and #11) as well as the great \\"Naked in the Rain\\". The end of the album keeps up the funky beat and contains more worthy songs (\\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\") and the sex tinged lyrics of \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\".<br />All up this is a very strong album that barely misses a beat, even though its long (coming in at 74 minutes or so). <BR>I think the chilli peppers peaked with this album, i havent heard the new one yet but i think it would be very hard to beat this overall effort. 5 stars.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Great story, great actore, great everything.  I loved it.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|What can I say, this movie will take you on the ride of your life.  Very enjoyable, moves along quickly and is a feast for the eyes.  The disc is loaded with extra features and the commentary was great!
B00005OWEG|5.0|It was good but it is even better now.  Shocking, futuristic and realistic at the same time.  Simply the best.
B0000073BG|3.0|It's a fine thing, having this album, but I think mostly because of &quot;A Trip to the Fair&quot; and perhaps &quot;Ocean Gypsy.&quot; The epic title work of 24 minutes leaves me wondering if I'll ever be able to &quot;appreciate&quot; it. And this from someone who always starts at the hardest albums by prog bands -- and ends up favoring them above all else. So I think they were impressed by their efforts to date and missed the mark on this one. They deserve to, and maybe it'll grow on me, but I've heard it now about 20 times w/o the main piece growing on me. The first track (&quot;A Trip&quot;) is the best!
630522577X|5.0|Hundreds of people said so many good words already.  What can I add?  I saw this movie back in 1965 or 1967 back in the Soviet Union.  I was a teenager and I was in love with movies and Audrey Hepburn.  I still love both of them and even more.
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show is superior in many way to both the Slip Shady LP and the Marshall Mathers LP.  I like the fact that the violence on this record is toned down a little and the creativity is turned WAY up.  \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" is one of the best raps ever, and \\"Without Me\\" is totally fun.  Eminem is a man who is willing to be totally honest about himself, but he also has a sense of humor about himself.  To think that he is a hatemonger or a homophobe is ignorance.  He is a man who has to say things that are over the top and shocking just to get people's attention.  Then once he has their attention, he puts everything that he has on the table.  He is truly a gifted artist, and he is definitly the most talented rapper, in terms of lyrical creativity, to ever emerge.  Hopefully, Eminem will continue to challenge and push himself to even greater heights.  Hopefully, Dr. Dre will be there to help for a long time to come.
B00003CX8V|5.0|The black and white comedies of 50's and 60's became quite famous for the screen plays, filming and acting.  And this one is above of many of them.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is some top notch music we have here.  Not a weak track. The taunt of the EPs are over. It is dark yet very enjoyable to lsiten to. My faves are Untitled, Obstacle, hands away, and NYC.  BUY and enjoy!
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is a flowless performance adaptation of a well-known play.  Top cast, top acting, top producing.  WOW.
B000001ELR|5.0|KISS finally made a heavy record after the [garbage] they issued since '80. This was the first decent KISS record sice \\"Dynasty\\". The sound rocks hard and Eric Carr molds his KISS legacy. This is the lost KISS album. Not many fans were left after \\"The Elder\\", and so this classic went unnoticed for years. I was very happy when they remastered this with the other classic records. Even though Ace is on the cover, he didn't play on the album. Bob Kulick(Bruce's older brother), and Vinnie Vincent added guitar parts. Vinnie Vincent would go on to be their new guitarist for the first non-makeup album, \\"Lick it Up\\" in '83.
B000062TU1|5.0|Hands down this is an awesome movie it keeps you in aw  the whole time watching.  The music is great, the characters are also great, and even the whole story of it is great.  I can't wait to see the next one that comes out I would expect it to be as good if not better than this one.  I would recomend this movie to anyone adults and children.
B000001ELP|1.0|First of all, I love KISS. I own this album and always will, simply because it's a KISS record. The truth is....this blows big time. It's not useful for anything other then completing collections. This is the worst idea Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley EVER had. Ace and Eric wanted to do a heavy metal album to make up for the \\"Unmasked\\" disaster. Good ole Gene and Paul said \\"nope\\", \\"were doing a concept album!\\" The songs don't make any sense and don't connect. The concept seems very similer to the \\"Zelda\\" nintendo games. When this record bombed, Gene and Paul knew they had blown it again. This is the only KISS record that didn't at least go gold. They decided to do a good metal album and returned with \\"Creatures of the Night\\" in '82. By then, the fans were gone, and a good album went ignored. KISS would have to remove their trademark makeup to get their fans to pay attention in the 80's.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is Floyd's best album they released. It opened the door to a new wave of rock. It was on the Billboards 200 albums chart for 741 weeks and has been on the pop catalog chart since 1991. If u had the combined weeks that totals at just bellow 25 YEARS on the charts. This means that people are still buying this album every day. This has to be considered one of the greatest albums, if not the greatest, along side Led Zep 4(obviosly Led Zeppelin), Revolver(Beatles), Exile on Main street(Rolling Stones), and Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band (Beatles Again). And if you really want to see something cool, buy the wizard of oz as well and it will be like trippin, with out the drugs.
B000002J09|5.0|One of the previous reviewers slagged the albums highlights in one swift blow... &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; are 3 great classics and MY favourites on the album... Ok, &quot;Stairway to heaven&quot; is a classic but also one of the most overplayed songs around... I like the hard rock Led Zep better than the acoustic folk thing... it's ok but nothing to write home about! Led Zep should be big and blasting the speakers and you get all that here... You should even get the 4-CD box because there are nearly no bad tracks by The Zeps... Everything by them is recommended except maybe the last two albums which are more average but still has some highlights!
B00006BTCA|5.0|From my first exposure to 'Untitled', I was hooked... this is simply great music.... haunting, rich, enveloping music.... personal favorite tracks are 'Untitled', 'Obstactle 1', 'NYC', 'Hands Away' and 'Leif Eriksson', but by NO means am I dismissing the other tracks.<br />Paul Bank's voice is beautiful.... Interpol makes me smile.
B000003TA4|5.0|Anyone that thinks this album is bad should just leave the planet. This is the best album from the best band ever. Anyone who thinks metalica is better is a nuthead. Every Nirvana album rocks. Anyone that doesn't think so is stupid.
B00003CXFG|4.0|This is a good example of the classic short science fiction tales that I used to read when I had time.  It isn't all that scary overall, but for short science fiction, that isn't the point.  Most short science fiction stories focus on putting people in a situation that can't happen in the real world and see how they react (like this story), or to show value of some unusual property of a person or thing (think the Cube).<br />The acting is okay (Riddick is very well done), but it does well exploring the characters of the story put in a position of learning out their new environment and, eventually, of time running out (and when it runs out, it runs out).  Just like the cube, the facts of the setting are unlikely at best, but that isn't the reason for the story.<br />I would look elsewhere if you want to see a good horror flick.  If you enjoy good science fiction (no, not Independence Day), you should enjoy this movie a lot.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney. What more can I say? You either love her or you hate her. But you have to give her at least one thing: She has good *POP* songs.<br />Truth be told, I adore Britney. I was one of the 1.3 million people who purchased the CD on the first day it was out. I was not disappointed.<br />Comprised of mostly upbeat tunes, Britney proves again and again that she knows what makes a *good* song. On the few ballads, Britney shows off some singing chops. No, she doesn't sound like Celine Dion of Whitney Houston, but she doesn't sound bad at all.<br />If you love pop music, I couldn't recommend this album more.
0316776963|5.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is a refreshing collection of poignant and hilarious stories.  Sedaris' self-deprecating humor is as complex as it is universal.  His stories revolve around the things we all love to make fun of most: family, friends and ourselves.  He writes primarily about these subjects against the back-drops of  North Carolina, France and New York City.  Although the transition between locations is abrupt, the collection of stories is held together by Sedaris' quirky humor and wonderful story-telling. <BR> The reader is lead through intimate stories of Sedaris' bizarre and often painful life by his equally bizarre and candid mind.  It is as if you have stolen his diary and are huddled in your closet reading it, trying desperately not to laugh. We all have funny family stories; Sedaris reminds us of them with accounts of his family.  But I have to think he is being modest when he claimed in an interview that his family is not as strange as you would think.  It is hard for any story about any brother to compete with You Can't Kill the Rooster in which he writes about his brother, an obscenity spewing, wanna be rapper from Raleigh.  However vulgar his brother Paul is, Sedaris endearingly captures the relationship between his father and brother.  Paul is described as \\"...both my father's best ally and  worst nightmare.  Here was a child who, by the time he had reached the second grade, spoke much like the toothless fisherman casting their nets into Albemarle Sound\\" (Sedaris 61).  <BR> In  Shiner Like a Diamond Sedaris writes about his sister Amy who makes her attractive features grotesque:<br /> She is by far the most attractive member of the family, yet she spends most of her time and money disguising herself beneath prosthetic humps and appliqued skin diseases.  She's got more neck braces and false teeth than she knows what to do with and her drawers and closets overflow with human hair. (Sedaris 137)<br />In the same story Amy wears a \\"fatty\\" suit home forChristmas to frighten her father who is obsessed with his daughter's appearance and has her face painted with bruises and scars for a magazine shoot.  In the Sedaris style Amy is not just weird and entertaining but also very lovable.<BR> These family stories make up most of the first half of the collection.  Due to his eccentricity, Sedaris' father is a favorite subject.  In Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities he tries desperately to have his children form a jazz quartet.  This of course results is a series of disappointments when each child eventually quits their assigned instrument.  This story also includes a bit about Sedaris' dream to sing jingles in the voice of Billie Holiday which can be fully appreciated only when listening to the author read the story himself (this is an excellent book to listen to on tape).  Sedaris' respect for his father comes out in Genetic Engineering, through a story about his work at IBM and his children's absolute disinterest in his job.  In Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist Sedaris' father's naive humor is a welcome addition to an otherwise long-winded story.  Through all the stories, his family threads its way through bittersweet memories and ridiculous situations with Sedaris' own blend of tender sarcasm. <BR> The second half of the book is made up of stories primarily about Sedaris' experiences in France.  There is virtually no transition between the stories about his childhood in North Carolina and these later stories about learning French and living in Paris with his boyfriend.  However, the quality of the stories makes up for this abrupt leap of time and place.  After  reading other stories in this book and stories in Barrel Fever and hearing pieces on National Public Radio, it is clear that Sedaris is an excellent observer of culture.  He is in fine form in Me Talk Pretty One Day.  <BR>  In several stories he writes about the challenge of learning French.  Sedaris' observations of both French culture and language are outrageously funny and touching.   In the stories Me Talk Pretty One Day and Jesus Shaves he describes his French class taught by a teacher whose \\"temperament was not based on a series of good and bad days, but, rather good and bad moments\\" (Sedaris 170).  In See You Again Yesterday he writes an overview of his first six trips to France with his boyfriend Hugh.  Reading it makes me marvel at the unending patience Hugh must have.  As the stories develop so does Sedaris' grasp of the language; by Smart Guy Sedaris is taking an IQ test in French.<BR> In many of these stories Sedaris uses his experience in France to reflect on American culture.  I Pledge Allegiance to the Bag is a dissociated  view of America that most Americans fail to see.  But at the same time, as in all these stories, Sedaris forces us to laugh at ourselves.  In Picka Pocketoni Sedaris listens as an American couple assumes he is French (and therefore can't understand a word of English) and berates him for smelling bad and being a pick pocket.  Sedaris creates a snapshot of these quintessential American tourists.  I can see them with their fanny packs and cameras and Sedaris quietly hunched in the corner, waiting to write it all down.<BR> Though some of the stories are too long, namely Twelve Moments in the Life of the Artist and The Late Show, Sedaris repeatedly redeems himself.  He is weird and can laugh at himself.  He is sweet and sarcastic in the same breath.  He is a talented story-teller.  Sedaris says the things we think but tells them better than we would ever hope.   Above all, he is hilarious.
0553277472|5.0|Seeing from the sheer amount of reviews on amazon for this book, I don't know if there is much point in me adding my review to this. But still I would like to say a few things about this book.<br />It is quite simply the best book I have ever read. I should clarify that it is the best book in my opinion, since it was exactly what I needed, when I came across it. It changed my life and gave me new insight and direction in life. It taught me that life isn't all fruitless and futile!<br />All the intellectual pursuits and studies I have done after reading this book have been in some way part of this one. It simply connected everything. It has been the most important book in my life.<br />A note about the sequel, LILA. Do read it. It is a must read after reading this book. Although, poorly written, LILA is a much clearer and down-to-earth philosphy compared to ZMM. It can be better applied to the world, as we know it. ZMM on the other hand gives the reader a complete perspective on things, which is of course of a higher \\"value\\".
6305327084|4.0|A ten-year class reunion is approaching as we are introduced to a group of likable yet clueless guys, and the longsuffering women in their lives. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a stellar performance as the voice of wisdom and tries to<br />give the guys a dose of reality therapy.<br />The all-star cast performs well in putting together this light-hearted look at the angst of youth. You will laugh out loud at some hilarious dilemmas as well as smile wryly at some universal truths. Recommended.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink's new cd offers a message for everyone who listens, a message they can relate to. Her music is natural; it has vision and allows imagination. Her timing couldn't be any better for this style of music. The key! People of all ages are buying her music and listing to it!  People discussing Pink's music have one thing in common and that being the number one reason for purchasing her cd was because of one song. Interestingly enough, many ended up relating to another song. Face it she has style, and a message for almost everyone, similar to that of U2. Most of us know how Bono and U2 responded to success; it's going to be interesting to see how Pink responds. Her destiny lies in her hands.
B00000634J|5.0|A beautiful CD.  A true masterpiece.<BR>One of the best music CDs ever made!
B00006C7G9|5.0|Well, it's been about a year since this magnificent series was aired on HBO.  I truly miss watching these top notch episodes with the highest caliber acting & storylines on the air. Last fall, when our country was reeling from an unprovoked attack on our soil, each episode of Band of Brothers was like therapy.  The stories of heroism, bravery, leadership, and good ol American soldiering gave me a feeling of pride in the soldiers that brought us the freedom we enjoy today. Watching Lt/Capt/Maj Winters & co. almost made me feel a part of the war on terror (vicariously anway).  I was not alone in being 'hooked' on each Sunday's installment of BoB either.  ...
B00000K0E5|4.0|Goldeneye is another bond show. cool gadgets, nice hot babes. this one is also the same. expect what you expect from other bond shows.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I purchased this movie with a little trepidation, considering that it was selling at a lower price than other brand new movies.  Also considering that other reviewers were slamming it.  Five minutes into the movie, I knew this trepidation was wasted.  The movie is a great retelling of the classic story.  Guy Pearce does a wonderful job of showing what a great actor he is.  The graphics are stunning and the look at the way distant future is very original.  If you collect DVD's, this is one to definitely add to the collection.  You will defintely not regret having spent the time on this wonderful movie.
0767800958|3.0|This movie had some of the very best dancers in Argentine tango. But the director clearly failed to use them in any meaningful way. Dance scenes are very limited, unless of course featuring Sally herself, who is not a very good tango dancer. The use of black &amp; white film may be OK for somebody's taste, but Argentine tango is full of colors, so once again the talent of a great cinemaphotographer is wasted. What a missed opportunity!
0316666343|5.0|A review on the cover says this is the kind of book that while browsing a bookstore you will want to stop by it, touch the spine and remember the emotional impact it had on you - I TOTALLY AGREE!! This is such a wonderfully moving, emotionally charged novel.  I would like to applaud the author for her imagination and sensitivity to a VERY DIFFICULT subject.  I was also amazed at how the story line didn't dwell in the usual anger and revenge theme but found the more realistic painful side of moving through the process of loss.  Alice Sebold has given all of us a thought provoking, heart-warming story of Suzie Salmon and her family - a family we will never forget.  Thank you Alice!
B0000640VO|5.0|At a time when everything seems sad and depressing, Amalie will make you happy.  It is wonderfully directed and the story is just plain charming.
B00005R87Q|5.0|The Fast and the Furious has absolutely EVERYTHING anyone could want in a movie. It has hot guys, hot girls, hot cars, great music and things blowing up. I can't imagine anyone who likes movies like this one not liking it. A totally HOT movie with my #1 favorite actor, Vin Diesel!
0316666343|1.0|Starting with a horrific crime, this book starts out as a good mystery but quickly becomes a sentimental cloying image of heaven.  I was sickened by the crime, then sickened by the rest of the novel.  It seemed to be a sort of combination of the movie Seven with the television series Touched by an Angel.  Give me a break.
B000066NW0|4.0|Let's face it, today if a girl is singing a music genre that is mainly made up of men, then they are .all going to tell her that she's not who she claims to be.  Which is not punk.  You can be a punk and not sing punk music.  i've never heard her claim to sing punk.  Besides, if Blink 182 changed Skater Boy to Skater girl and sung it, punks out there would have been screaming the lyrics like no tommorow.  The Rock Show is a very similar song to me.  But the female voice makes it \\"poppy\\" sounding.  Avril Lavigne is only 17 years old.  She's already devoloped her voice and sings and writes her OWN music which is more than I can say for allot of other bands out there.   Alanis Morrisette, Blink 182 and allot of other bands out there didn't hit it big with their first album but we don't dig out \\"Budda\\" and say how much it sucks.  This is her first album, give her a chance to get a little older and come out with a few more album's before we throw her in the garbage.  I think she has allot of potential
B00003CXTG|2.0|I was a History major and really looking forward to seeing a movie about Pearl Harbor.  With all the special effects and Hollywood wizardry they produce today, I could hardly wait.  The trailor made the movie look like a non-stop action event from start to finish.  What you actually got was much, much less.  You got a WWII version of Titanic.  The producers took a very interesting topic (Pearl Harbor) an ruined it by 1)Casting Ben Affleck, 2)Throwing in some cheesy love triangle, and 3) giving this movie an anti-climactic ending with the Doolittle Raid.  It's almost as if the producers couldn't just give the viewer the basic facts and portray what actually happened.  Noooo, they had to throw in &quot;Selling Factors&quot; that would make the movie more appealing to a larger audience.  What you get is a watered-down version.  The best of Pearl Harbor?  Definately the 30-min. scene of the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The worst of Pearl Harbor:  Kate Beckingsale waiting at the airport and, unknown to her, having to watch her loved one being unloaded from the plane in a box.  How CHEESY.  I would have walked out if it were not the last scene in the movie.  Don't waste your money.
B000063DFS|5.0|In my opinion &quot;No More Tears&quot; is the best Ozzy album that he has made. <br />This album shows the growing talents of guitarist Zakk Wylde who I now find to be one of the best guitarists yet. He uses both aspects of Metallica. The lighting speed solos of Kirk Hammet with the cool riffs of James Hetfield. Except all of this found in one man. <br />When Zakk combines his guitar with the percussion and great bass of Mike Inez (who went to Alice In Chains) along with Ozzy's ageing but still brilliant voice. The sound that comes from this cd is true rock music. Not men wearing masks who scream and yell and call it metal<br />The songs on this album go from soft rock such as &quot;Mama Im Coming Home&quot; (my favorite song) to hard rock such as &quot;Mr Tinkertrain&quot; and &quot;Desire.&quot;<br />Anyway this album is one of the best rock albums so if you are a true rock fan go and buy this album. You won't be dissapointed because you won't find any weirdos wearing masks on this.
B000069HKH|5.0|Its about time Springsteen and the E-Street band got together again.You can see why these guys are some of the most talented mucisians in the United States. The Rising is one of Springsteen best work ever. The whole cd is enjoyable and it gets better with each listen. Its a feel good cd in times that are hard. He shows much respect when playing songs that related to 9/11.<BR>Yes, is about time. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.
0792844882|5.0|...because I could never muster up enough nerve to buy this movie from a retail store.
6304140428|4.0|This is not a movie I want to see again. The acting is superb and very, very real. It is basically an investigation of what alcohol does to the mind and to relationships, and as such it demonstrates all too well the depths people can plumb when in the grip of Demon Drink. All those revolting emotions are here: envy, bitterness, shallowness, gratuitous nastiness, the sick delight in hurting others' feelings. Yes, it's a brilliant movie. And like an aggressive drunk at full speed, it goes on and on and on. It made me feel very pleased with myself that I don't like alcohol. Morticia Addams of the Addams Family would have adored these people.
B00005YU1O|4.0|The first half of the movie is like being trapped in a college coffee house discussion of philosphy.  Ideas that we have all heard before ranted on and on.  Interesting at first but after an hour I was gettins somewhat annoyed, luckily the animation is enough to keep you entertained.  Some of the animation is a little choppy in parts, but that might have been intended.   The animation styles change throughout the movie giving it a strange but effective painterly feel.  A large team of animators worked on this film, understandibly, and that is part of the appeal, if you don't like what is being said, or the annimation style, you can just wait five or ten minutes and another style of annimation will take over.  This is a truly original film about lucid dreams...a hot topic in the world of cinema.  Vannila sky is another film that dealt with the idea of lucid dreams, however waking life makes the lucid dream last the entire movie.  This film is a huge accomplishment for director Richard Linkliter (Dazed and Confused, and Slacker), I can't wait to see what he's cooking up next.  I highly reccomend this film for its visual appeal, if you are into those artsy type movies.  You can even watch with the volume on mute and still enjoy it.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Like the video game it's based on, Resident Evil delivers the shocks, scares, and screams we've come to expect from the game.  However, the movie doesn't offer quite an eerie atmosphere as we've come to expect from the game, but then again this isn't the game we're talking about.  Director Paul W.S. Anderson (who brought another video game series to the big screen with the original Mortal Kombat, as well as Event Horizon) directs with his usual flair and penchant for some bloody (but not very gorey, most of the gore is kept off screen) violence.  However, the film isn't scary at all, the only thing that is  scary is how gorgeous Milla Jovovich is.  You'll know pretty much when something is going to happen, and the special effects could have been more polished, I mean you can tell that the Licker is computer generated, it doesn't even look real at all.  However, the film does have some things going for it, the original storyline (as in not taken from the game but inspired by it) is a refreshment, and the score which handled by Marilyn Manson adds the movie.  All in all, Resident Evil is a mixed bag, but it is a lot better than a lot of the other garbage out today (XXX anyone?).
B000002WNP|5.0|I love this box, but after making a big deal in the liner notes included about the 68' comeback special and the song &quot;If I Can Dream&quot; which concluded it, I was amazed that it was not one of the songs chosen to be on this 5 cd set. What were they thinking? Did I miss something?
0312265859|5.0|Janet Evanovich has created a very loveable, bumbling, character in Stephanie Plum.  Hard Eight, is the eighth book in her number entitled series about this amateur bounty hunter and her exploits.  Stephanie works for her slimy cousin Vinnie as a bond enforcement officer.  The idea being she is supposed to earn a living in capturing your run of the mill criminals who haven't fronted up for their court dates.  Only Stephanie always has trouble with that part and as a result, usually gets more than a scrape on the knee and has to call for back up.  Enter the two male interests that are more than professional, Joe Morelli the Cop and Ranger the Cuban heart throb and renegade bounty hunter.<br />In Hard Eight, Stephanie actually shows some backbone and a little bit of improvement in her law enforcement job skills and it's about time too. It's good to see the action is plentiful, the laughs and one liners are original. Janet Evanovich has finally let Stephanie grow up with her skills and have some luck in life. Considering it has taken eight books for her to improve, from a screaming pair of legs with `Jersey hair' who lives off junk food.  <br />This time round, Stephanie's paycheck depends on whether she can catch Eddie Abruzzi. Without getting killed by the ex mobster boss and all around psychopath.  Besides trying to make dinner time at her parents house, dodge death callings from Abruzzi, cars exploding, Stephanie has to deal with a few other matters at hand. Her confusion over Ranger her sometimes partner in crime and bounty hunter back up and Joe Morelli's role in her life, and hers in his. Plus there is the added bonus of the disappearance of a child involved in a custody case of a family friend.<br />All the good parts that Evanovich had in her first Plum novel are still here. Rex the hamster and survivor extraordinaire, the grandma from hell - Grandma Murzer, Steph's car issues, the ex-prostitute and Cagney and Lacey wannabe - Lula.<br />Janet Evanovoich has gone all out with Hard Eight, making it a full on novel of action and laughs which is good to see.  I felt  she got a little mundane in a few of the other Stephanie Plum novels.  However, she retains me as an avid fan with this one.<br />I can't wait to see what Ms Evanovich and Ms Plum have install for us in the next two books in this series!
0783113943|5.0|i will not disagree with most of the reviews here, 'gia' the movie was powerfully absorbing, strangely addictive and highly provocative.  a very sad biography detailing what happens to a person whose seemingly glorious life is in fact experienced as vacuous, lonely, and without direction.  the tragedy is heightened when that life is erroneously perceived by the majority on the outside to be glamourous and wonderous. the tragedy becomes incredible when these 'others' clamour around the 'wonderous' beauty with no intention of uplifting or affirming, rather to greedly devour her very essence in the hopes of having access to the qualities that makes her unique....such was the life of gia carangi.  the movie reinforces the phrase &quot;it is the beautiful bird that gets caged.&quot;<br />while i would agree with most of the reviewers here that angelina jolie's performance was outstanding i would like to add a couple of caveats: the first is that she had quite a meaty role to work with..the story sells itself, you are riveted simply because gia's life is so riveting, regardless of the mode of presentation!  secondly, i truly believe that angelina was not necessarily acting but possibly re-living a portion of her life (the actress admitted that gia carangi's life amazingly paralleled her own).  the role was not a stretch for joli (who seems to select characters who embody much of herself) and so her realistic portrayal should not be so astonishing.  don't get me wrong, i admire angelina jolie's talent, she has a raw realism in her performances that is mesmerizing, i am a real fan...'gia' however did not provide significant breadth for the actress, rather permitted jolie to re-address a part of her life which she admitted was difficult to go back to.<br />i will end by highly recommending this movie.
B00005JKQX|5.0|A Beautiful mind is an astonishing movie.It is one of the best movies I have seen.Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr., a brilliant real-life mathematician and Nobel Prize winner, now in his 70s, who's also a real-life schizophrenic. But when we first meet him as a Princeton graduate student, he's just another eccentric genius, a loner obsessed with finding a truly original idea.It's also an amazing flim because it explains about the illness schizophrenia and makes people understand about the illness and it makes them learn more about schizophrenia.It also makes me like it even more because it just shows no matter how ill you are, if there is somebody to support and give you courage it may cure a bit of the illness just.Jennifer Connelly goes away with an Oscar for best supporting actress. It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Russell Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.Ron Howard has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years. With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves. Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama such as the ones he has so far directed:Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13.A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease. The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood. DVD features include commentary by Ron Howard, deleted scenes with Howard's commentary, meeting John Nash, special effects featurette, and more. Oscar winner for best picture, best director, best supporting actress and best adapted screenplay. A must to your collection. If you like this movie I would reccomend Rat Race.
0316666343|3.0|Despite the unattractive packaging and cheap paper that make this book look and feel like a Young Adult novel, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a very interesting debut novel. The book begins immediately with a violent and disturbing act.  From this, we get the unique point of view of the victim looking down from Heaven on the people whom her murder has affacted: her family, her friends, acquaintances and even the killer himself.  While this sounds like the stuff of saccharine drama, it works ... for a while.  The book is not schmaltzy, but sad and enlightening.<br />It is interesting to watch the characters grow and change in the aftermath of the murder, even moreso since they are being observed the entire time.  The book tends to run a bit long in the end, and suffers from a few supernatural twists that ruin the gravity of the situation and the reality of life on Earth (despite our narrator's heavenly vantage point), but despite that, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a book worth reading.
0380820846|5.0|I don't read to many of the romance genre books anymore, but this book has me inspired to read more if they are like this one. I appreciated how the character wasn't a complete idiot who thought to herself that a man would truly complete her. She knew who she was, had made a name for herself, had great friends and a witty repartee. Give me a saucy gal who can speak her mind against any man, and I'll be reading your books!!

6305546789|5.0|I've written two reviews for this film before, and I still haven't paid proper homage to it. How can you really being to praise one of the few true timeless thrillers? A film that works so well on so many levels and continues to work to this day with its amazingly haunting musical score, terrific (and much ripped off) visual style, and creepy villain...? Well, I guess you go back to the beginning.<br />This film is largely autobiographical for me. I first watched it when I was six years old. My mother, not being the sharpest tool in the shed, didn't realize that this probably wasn't the best idea, but she prepared me for the violence by informing me of movie trickery and all the whatnot they used to make it look good. I watched the film. I was terrified by it. But I was also fascinated. I would watch it again and again over the succeeding years (I can now recite the dialogue in my sleep with the music playing in my head to the exact beat and tempo). Some of my earliest memories of childhood involve role-playing games I would engage in with my soul sister Lisa, who was the only other kid my age I had known to have seen the films. She would be Jamie Lloyd (from \\"Halloween 4 and 5\\"), and I would be Michael of course. She has since untangled herself from the web of John Carpenter's universe, but I'm still as helplessly enthralled as any legless fly. If I had to pick one film that has affected me on an almost biblical level, this is it. I have the stories, the scripts, and the swelling ideas to prove it.<br />\\"Halloween\\" defies all logic that a thriller becomes less compelling with sequential viewings. And while the jumps and bursts of music do become somewhat moot after repeated viewings, the film still works. John Carpenter's score still has the power to send chills down your spine. And the look of that mask with its zero expression and clammy whiteness permeating through the dark like a beacon of evil still has the power to give a nightmare or two. The performances all around are convincing and good. How many times can you really say that about a horror film, especially one in the seventies or eighties? Very few. And the ripoffs of this film, not to mention the incessant harrang of sequels that continue to spill out of the Hollywood toxic waste facilities to this day, only make this film stand out more.<br />This is moviemaking in its highest form. And to think it was just a bunch of kids who made it really opens your eyes to the possibilities of filmmaking. It's not just another dumb slasher movie with predictable sequences of action and gratuitous nudity. This film gave birth to all the ideas that made stupid movies like that later on, though. But what they still have yet to learn is that you can't rip this film off. Perfection has a way of shielding itself from the mindless antics of big budget producers who try to milk the success of another film by reproducing the formula and shooting it with more breasts and pyrotechnics. Sorry guys, but John Carpenter continues to show you up to this very day. \\"Don't mess with the bull, or you'll get the horns.\\"l around are convincing and good.

0345448898|5.0|Few writers can weave force, imagination and conviction so well as Pullman has done in this trilogy. His gift for suspense is extraordinary, and also for vivid description and fierce poignancy--in re-reading, I found myself dissolved in tears again, time after time. But I think that some of the secondary characters are best of all. Serafina Pekkala and Iorek Byrnison seem to be already immortal (consulting Google), and then Lee Scoresby and the extraordinary Hester, No-Name the harpy--and Mrs. Coulter, all by herself, is phenomenal.<br />I'm rather sorry that there are movie plans for this trilogy; I'm not sure the movies are up to it. But the good news is that Pullman plans another book about \\"some of the characters.\\" Because I am an adult, I would love this to be an adult novel, exploring some of the themes at the end of the third book, but I can see that this might be a marketing mistake. In any case, I can't wait to read it.
B0000640VN|5.0|I feel the performances of Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman were wonderful. The openness of &quot;their inner feelings,&quot; was particularily both unusual and delightful. The characters were beliveable and likeable. The vulnerably of &quot;Kate&quot; was something most women can relate to and &quot;Leopold&quot; could have won the heart of any woman in today's world. The unusual twist at the end was fantastic as well. As an avid movie goer and watcher, I can generally figure out the ending within the first 20 minutes (or less). This ending came as a complete surprise which mad the movie even more enjoyable.
0375704027|5.0|I love this book.  Love love love it. Elegaic and pitch perfect, 'Norwegian Wood' has all the motional vibrance and intensity of early Murakami work, but here that energy is crystalized. The novel's action is akin to tasting the first drop of water to melt away from a frozen desert.  Yes, it's that kind of book.<br />This being Takashi Murakami, however, there are girls.  Girls who vanish.  Witty smart girls and sad tragic girls.  There is also great music.  Someone should market a CD called the 'The Music of Murakami'. He's constantly reerencing music in his works, giving his readers a built in soundtrack.  This book is a classic.  Murakami may be the first truly universal storyteller.  If only we could get more of his work translated to English!
B000069CWE|5.0|Like most people, hearing that Linkin Park were releasing a remix version of the their debut album \\"Hybrid Theory\\" ,I didn't expect it to be much different except for  a few differnt beats  thrown in here and there. I didn't believe it could be possible for them to turn the greatest album ever, \\"Hybrid Theory\\", into an even bigger success.....But they have. From the moment these 20 powerful masterpieces poured through my headphones it brought me to a world of Musical Excellence. Linkin Park have built this world with their creative intelligence, masterful lyrics, and controlling beats that grip you from the moment they sound. It's the most amazing compliation I have ever heard. They are true Masters. <BR>The album opens with the powerful remix of 'PTS.OF.ATHRTY' which takes you deeper into the whole atmosphere of the song. <BR>'ENTH E ND' is stripped of its hard metal sound but its the beat and the updated wording of the song that grips you.<BR>'FRGT/10' is transfromed into a much deeper statement and is more dramatic. <BR>'P5HNG ME A*WY' is a remix of the beats and vocals and is more enjoyable to listen to. <BR>'PLC.4 MIE HED' is also just a updated version of the original but very entertaining. <BR>'X-ECUTIONER STYLE' is a compliation of different beats remixed with Black Thought providing the vocals. <BR>'H!VLTG3' has a jazzy type feel to it and although I prefer the original mix its still an interesting listen. <BR>'WTH>YOU' is brillant, with a strong rock feel to it, its very powerful to listen to. <BR>'PPR:KUT' updated with cool voals, beats and guitars, its excellent. <BR>'RNW@Y' is stronger than the original and more meaningful. <BR>'MY<DSMBR' I also prefer the original version of this song but this remix of it isn't to be disgarded. <BR>'BY_MYSLF' is gripping with its harsh guitar sound and the vocals are updated for the chorus. <BR>'KYUR4 TH ICH' is just remixed with additional beats and sounds for effect. <BR>'1STP KLOSR' is one of my favourites with Jonathan Davis contributing his own unique sound to this unique track. There is almost a two minute build up to the explosive main tune and is much stronger and deeper than the original. Brilliant. <BR>'KRWLNG' this is another of my favourites and is also the finale to an awesome collection of tracks. Aaron Lewis provides vocals alongside Chester Bennington and the pair come together on a level of musical brillance in this masterpiece.<BR>Overall you can't put down anything that Linkin Park put their intelligence to. They are the true Musical Masters and this album is a definite recommended buy.
6302800897|5.0|Otto Preminger, who produced and directed this fine courtroom drama starring James Stewart, Lee Remick, George C. Scott and Ben Gazzara, had a knack for translating best-selling mid-cult novels to the screen (The Man with the Golden Arm (1955); Exodus (1960); Advise and Consent (1962) and others) usually in a nervy manner, sometimes heavy-handed, sometimes pretentious, but always worth a look.  Part of his secret was star power.  Like Hitchcock, he liked to go with big names supported by fine character actors.  And part of his secret was his long experience in both the theater and films going back to the silent film era.  He knew how to put together a movie.  But more than anything it was his near-dictatorial control over the production (something directors seldom have today, and never in big budget films--Preminger's were big budget for his day) that allowed him to successfully capture the movie-going audience at midcentury.<br />This and Laura (1944) are two of his films that go beyond the merely commercial and achieve something that can be called art.  Seeing this for the first time forty-three years after it was released I was struck by the fine acting all around and the sturdy, well-constructed direction.  James Stewart's performance as the Michigan north country lawyer Paul Biegler might shine even more luminously than it does except for a certain performance by Gregory Peck three years later as a southern country lawyer in the unforgettable To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).  Lee Remick, in a frank, but imperfect imitation of Marilyn Monroe, co-stars as Laura Manion, the wife of army Lt. Frederick Manion (Gazzara) whom Bielger is defending on a murder charge.  The defense is temporary insanity because the man he shot raped his wife.  Bielger slyly gains sympathy for his client by deliberately allowing it to come out that Laura is sexy and flirtatious enough to drive any man crazy.  Indeed, he tricks the prosecution into doing his work for him.  George C. Scott plays Claude Dancer, a big city prosecutor, with snake-like precision while Gazzara manages to combine introspection and cockiness as the young lieutenant.  Fine support comes from Eve Arden (best known as Our Miss Brooks on TV and in the movie of that name) as Biegler's loyal secretary and Arthur O'Connell as his alcoholic mentor.  Kathryn Grant, who gave up a promising film career to marry Bing Crosby and have children, has a modest role as the murdered man's daughter.<br />I've seen many courtroom dramas, some real, some fictional, since this film first appeared, but I have to say it stands up well.  The action (for the most part) feels realistic and the tension is nicely created and maintained.  The resolution is satisfying and the ending is as sly and subtle as any country lawyer might want.  Incidentally, if this movie had more total votes cast at IMDb, it would rank in the top one hundred of all time, which is where it belongs.<br />See this for James Stewart whose easy, adroit style under Preminger's direction found full range.  Although he gave many fine performances, I don't think Stewart was ever better than he was here.ys Claude Dancer, a big city prosecutor, with snake-like precision while Gazzara manages to combine introspection and cockiness as the young lieutenant.

B000001FS3|4.0|Having just listened to this CD for the bizillionth time last night, I am once against struck by the enduring beauty and meaning of the songs on &quot;The Joshua Tree.&quot; This is, without a doubt, one of the best and most important pop recordings to come out of the 80's.<br />Perhaps more than any of their other albums, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; captures the great themes of U2's music. Politically forward, spiritually searching and earthily honest--these eleven songs all still speak as loudly today as they did in 1987.<br />The first three songs (Where the Streets Have No Name; I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For; With or Without You) are deservedly the most famous. Yet all of the songs are worthy in their own way of recognition.<br />It has always mystified me why &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot; is not more widely played. It is the lyrical gem of the CD. Likewise, I always thought &quot;In God's Country&quot; deserved and could easily find a larger audience.<br />U2 got to work with a dream team in Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, and Steve Lillywhite. It shows in the absolutely great yet transparent sound of this recording.<br />I can honestly say that I wholeheartedly recommend this album. Get it today.
B00000JGHM|5.0|When De niro and Al paccio combine in any movie then the heat will escelate and will rise, and in this movie, the heat was too much, the action was outstanding, the story is filled with action and brain storming. the characters were really outstanding, this is really a great movie.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|this is one of those &quot;art&quot; films in which the production and style is key to really the entertaining aspect of the flick.  however memento is strictly a one-time offering. after watching this dark, twisted film of a very confused man suffering from insomnia you'll not want to really go through the ride again.  the film invokes discussion, but lacks true depth in the rather twisted and confusing message.  you'll either love it or hate it; film buffs will find it a breath of fresh air and casual viewers may simply find it depressing and unispired.
B000068TPN|5.0|My brother actually fought in the war, and said this movie's depiction was pretty accurate.  I actually don't think it depicts Americans as cicilized and galliant like some other people have said, it just shows that they had better technology.  This is probablly one of the best Vietnam war movies, arughbly second only too Platoon.  It is spot on to the book it was based on too.  All and all it was a realistic great war movie!

Daffy Duck (who is repeatedly smashed in this film) always made me laugh much more.<br />Now that that's out of the way, the movie itself, is a bit shady on the plot, but offers good fun for kids. The characters are well-animated and the voices are (although not perfect) pretty close to the original Mel Blanc versions. Michael Jordan's weak acting is not helpful to the enjoyment of Space Jam, but he's a basketball player, not an actor so it's understandable. Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld) adds some more fun to the whole thing and manages a nice (small) amount of time onscreen.<br />Overall, Space Jam is a good movie for kids but adults who share my same feelings about Daffy Duck should be mildly disappointed. Be warned: the rabbit steals the spotlight once again.

0316666343|5.0|As I read the last chapters of this novel, I heard music playing in my head--the kind of music that springs from hope and promises new beginnings. By showing us life from death's perspective, Alice Sebold gives new meaning to what we consider to be everyday moments. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has suffered an unexplainable loss.
0783229321|5.0|This is my personal favorite comedy of all time.<br />And it's a movie Hollywood is STILL trying to repeat and never seems to get right (from PORKY'S and BACHELOR PARTY to AMERICAN PIE and VAN WILDER, they just can't get lightning to strike twice).<br />What makes ANIMAL HOUSE so great?<br />It started when the National Lampoon magazine planned to make a movie of its side-splitting high school yearbook parody (the setting was changed from high school to college to include more adult humor).  Some of the funniest stuff I've ever read was in the pages of Lampoon in the 1970's and these were the guys writing the script.<br />Then a perfect cast came together.  I personally believe that one of the great strengths of ANIMAL HOUSE is that the &quot;bad guys&quot; are as well-crafted and hilarious as the Deltas: Dean Wormer's &quot;It's time someone put their foot down...and that foot is me&quot; and Douglas C. Niedermeyer's ROTC rants are as quoted as often as &quot;Toga!  Toga!&quot;<br />They knew they had something with John Belushi: I've read an early draft of the script and, after Belushi was signed, they consolidated three different characters to give &quot;Bluto&quot; more screen time.  A very smart move.<br />I also believe director John Landis gave the film an affectionate, nostalgic look as well as brought a wonderful timing to every scene (holding on the expression of a character before cutting to the next scene added more laughs to several scenes).<br />I know I've given a film school flunky's opinion of this film, but the main reason ANIMAL HOUSE works so well: it's hilarious!
B000067FP7|5.0|You really cannot easily classify GREMLINS into a particular genre. Is it a children's film? A comedy? A horror flick? It's a little of each, so there's something for everyone out there, and when added together, it makes for one entertaining package.<br />But let's talk about this &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD. Unlike the previous edition that was released on DVD a few years ago, this one has quite a lot of features. The filmmaker's commentary is funny and informative, the actor's commentary, though less educational, is also amusing to listen to. Lead star Zach Galligan seems to have a photographic memory, as he remembers quite a lot about every scene he was in, and has a fun time reminiscing.<br />It's quite fortunate that instead of incorporating the deleted scenes into the film and coming out with a new cut of the film, they just add these as a supplement, since the scenes merely slow down the story. Watch out for Judge Reinhold in many of these scenes. His entire subplot practically got cut from the final version of the film.<br />The photogallery is easy to navigate, just forward and back buttons; the featurette is a 5 minute 1983 &quot;On The Set&quot; piece.<br />But the real collectible on this disc is the film itself. Unlike many films from the 1980s, this one does not feel dated. It has that little quality that makes it timeless. It's rare that a film can have you laughing hysterically one minute, then jumping out of your seat the next. This is simply mixed-genre filmmaking at its finest.
B000069HKH|5.0|Been listening and rockin' to the Boss for near 30 years and this one is right up there.  Very, very solid.  And to see him and the band doing these live is even more so.  He did all the 15 songs plus 10 others!  Highly recommend.  Get the CD, see Bruce in a town near you.
B00005J6UP|4.0|Well, gee-whiz! Looks like I'm not the only one who waxes nostalgic about this flick! Of course, having grown up in the 80s, gettin' sentimental over The Goonies  is pretty much a given. How can any self-respecting Gen-Xer NOT be taken back whenever he/she watches this bad-boy? Yeah, see what I mean? Heck, I even remember re-enacting my fave Goonies  moments with the few friends I had way back when. I was always stuck with havin' to play 'Chunk' for obvious reasons (I still do today!) but that's cool, 'cuz he had the best lines anyway! Now I'll admit that doin' the Truffle-Shuffle was sorta lame. But the guy you really hadda feel for was the one who was picked to play Sloth !<BR> <BR>All right, enough nostalgia now; time for me to break out a proper review. Now if you're lookin' for a synopsis of the flick, take a look at the top of the item page. That having been said, I'm goin' to comment on the picture quality (pretty good, but not quite tops compared to other DVDs in the Warner Bros.  catalogue) and sound quality (above-average; but like the picture quality, Warner  has done better with their other video discs).<br />Now it's on to the special features, of which there are a decent amount. To me the most notable extra feature is the commentary audio track, featuring director Richard Donner and the six Goonies  adventurers, all grown up! Just about everybody throws in an anecdote or two as the flick plays on, except for 'Data ', who had to be prodded into talking by the others on occasion. Sean 'Mikey ' Astin throws in his two cents every once in a while for about the first forty minutes, then mysteriously disappears for the rest of the presentation. And Corey 'Mouth ' Feldman spends quite a few moments takin' shots from his castmates regarding his character's VERY 80s fashion tastes, which included parachute pants and a Prince  Purple Rain  T-shirt!<br />Then there's the behind-the-scenes mini-doc featuring Donner getting things going with the kids, and ExecutiveProducer Steven Spielberg throwing in a few comments about the flick and how it relates to his childhood memories of old-time adventure flicks and stuff. Also of note are the outtakes. The showcase cutting-room scrap: a scene at the local convenience store featuring the fab four of Mikey , Mouth , Data , and Chunk . Personally, I felt this particular bit should've been restored to the movie itself, but then again, it's probably best that they left well enough alone. The rest of the excised snippets include a giant octopus attack in the hidden pirate cove, and a few scene extensions.<br />Last-- and least-- is the two-part Cyndi Lauper Goonies 'R' Good Enough video, which has to be one of the weirdest and dumbest music videos ever produced. It's basically a fifteen-minute-long mini-movie featuring Cyndi going on her very own Goonies -style adventure, with a few of the mo-pic's principals and a lotta WWF stars roundin' out the cast. If you ever thought that Captain Lou Albano, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Classy Freddy Blassie, or Andre The Giant had no acting ability, this unfortunate little ditty-drama will prove you right!<br />Now if only Warner would put their discs in PLASTIC keep cases instead of cardboard, this bad-boy would be near-perfect!<br />'Late
B000059XUO|5.0|I realy like this movie which is oveious because I actually baught it... I liked this movie because of the plot,justice for victims; and the dark humor that is prsented trhoughout this movie. I know many people who agree that this movie is one of the best we have seen; and regularly sit around and quote lines from it in our daily conversations. The acting is fairly good, and the dark photography is spectacullar. The costumes are great and the makeup is in all respects interseting. The music in this movie rocks, both the score and the soundtrack. This movie is an all around good movie . the only reservations I have about it are I would not recomend this to young veiwers under the age of 14 or so, because of stong language and violance. Most of the violance in the movie is justified though... any - way this is a very good movie.
0151008116|5.0|In Pondicherry, India, Piscine \\"Pi\\" Patel enjoys his childhood as the son of the local zookeeper means plenty of fun things to do.  In that role, Pi learns a great deal about the wild beasts that his father keeps.  Though a Hindu, Pi also finds pleasure in learning about Christianity and Islam and willingly practices the three belief systems over the objections of his family and religious leaders.<br /><br />Now sixteen, Pi's father decides to relocate to Canada.  His dad sells most of the animals, but takes a few with them on their sea voyage.  However, disaster strikes with the ship sinking.  Pi accompanied by a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra and Richard Parker the 450-pound Bengal share a raft.  Richard eliminates the other animals leaving the raft to Pi and him.  With water everywhere and no land in sight, Pi will have to use everything he knows about tigers to stay alive.  If he makes it to land, Pi wonders whether to tell the truth about his harrowing adventure or make up something more comfortable for the authorities.<br /><br />THE LIFE OF PI uses incredible images to provide readers with a powerful well-written allegory about life and religion.  Pi is an intriguing lead protagonist, but must share top billing with his ocean traveling crony the fascinating Richard the tiger hearted.  Yann Martel's story line is extremely deep yet quite simple as if Rudyard Kipling wrote The Old Man and the Sea.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000003TA4|5.0|Everyone knows who Nirvana is. But how many of you actually listened to them??? The bottom line is, If you're a fan of music you should have already had this album back in 91...Pointblank! I don't care what type of musical genre you generally like, but everyone should have Nevermind in the collection. If you don't then you're playing yourself. This album changed America, and brought forth a whole new generation of Generation Xers. Who were free thinking ,politicaly conscious young adults. This album did for rock what Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions did for hip-hop...It shifted an entire change in one sub-culture all together. Go Get this.
0767827902|5.0|Peter Bogdanovich's examination of a small, Texas town in the middle of nowhere, where everyone knows each other, their weaknesses, their failures, and their dreams. It's a film filled with sadness, with hopelessness, and isolation. It's a film about sex, not glamroized. It's an honest film. But it also contains a sweet tenderness, hidden beneath the scorn, the sadness, and the desperation. Oscar winner Cloris Leachman shines as the widow who shares a brief love affair with the main character. The film is beautiful, with its wide shots of the open skies, shot in black and white (uncommon in 1971), an obivous homage to John Ford. But the performances of Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Bridges and the rest of the actors are so sympathetic, so tender, that it's almost impossible not to involve yourself into the lives of these people.
630588255X|5.0|First off you cannot tell me that the people at the American Film Institute did not know exactly what they were doing when they had to pick a film for this particular slot on their Top 100 Love Stories.  I certainly have found memories of \\"Harold and Maude,\\" which must have been one of the first black comedies I ever saw (along with \\"M*A*S*H\\" and \\"The Hospital\\").  This is a film where a lot of people must have had their heads explode trying to decide if they were more offended by Harold's hobby of committing fake suicides for the \\"benefit\\" of his mother or the fact that the 20-year old Harold has an affair with the 79-year old Maude.<br />That is basically all you know about this particular film to decide if it is even remotely close to your cup of tea.  Screenwriter Colin Higgins, who went on to write the \\"Foul Play\\" and \\"Nine to Five,\\" and director Hal Ashby, who went on to do \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Being There,\\" hit a pair of bullseyes with the casting of this quirky little story.  Bud Cort plays Harold and you almost forget how good of a job he does with his part because Ruth Gordon has the part of her life as Maude.  Rediscovered in her Oscar winning Supporting Actress role in \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" Gordon certainly was not going to find a lot of plumb roles for somebody her age--then along came this script because sometimes good things happen to good people.  You are guaranteed that you will never forget this movie.<br />Maude's Words of Wisdom: (1) \\"Vice, virtue, it's best not to be too moral--you cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality.\\"  (2) \\"Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You can't let the world judge you too much.\\" (3) \\"A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they're not dead, really, they're just backing away from life. Reach out. Take a chance. Get hurt, even! Play as well as you can. Go team! GO! Give me an L! Give me an I! Give me a V! Give me an E! L-I-V-E! LIVE! ...Otherwise, you got nothing to talk about in the locker room.\\"<br />If you enjoy \\"Harold and Maude,\\" then check out these other films on the AFI's list: This is a hard one.  I am thinking #17 \\"Moonstruck,\\" because of the age difference between the two main characters, and #52 \\"The Graduate,\\" because of the folk music soundtrack.  But there is really nothing truly compatible on the AFI list if you stop at #100.the locker room.\\"<br />If you enjoy \\"Harold and Maude,\\" then check out these other films on the AFI's list: This is a hard one.

B00005O3VC|5.0|I distinctly remember the Pink Frilly Edges being advertised on the DVD, but they are nowhere to be found!  *sigh* But it is of no matter.  That's the only thing wrong with this edition of this absolutely uproarious movie.  You WILL cry, and your stomach WILL cramp up until you cannot laugh anymore without taking a pain killer.  You WILL sit through the entire end credits- and I mean ALL of them.  Watch it, you'll see (he he he he).<br />Ah, yes the special edition version.  Despite the fact that it is lacking Pink Frilly Edges (it's ok, I made them myself and taped them over the tv... yes I ACTUALLY did this), the features are well worth watching over again (unlike most documentaries that are good for only one viewing).  I especially liked the subtitles for people who don't like the film- hilarious!  Although if it is your first viewing I would recommend watching it without these subtitles, they might distract you.  The scenes that were translated into Japanese then re-translated back into English (as subtitles) are also wonderful!  Who could argue with the \\"Great Sake Cup\\"?  And, of course, the Lego version is amazing!<br />This is an EXCELLENT version of an EXCELLENT film.  I think everyone should see it at least once (don't get discouraged by the ending- it grows on you!)
B00003CXTG|1.0|The monumental historical tale of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the events leading up to and following that act are virtually overlooked in this travesty of a film.  What is arguably the turning point of the 20th century is used only as a backdrop for a cheesy, formulaic love story.  The acting is poor, the script is poorer, and the director wants us to forgive these because of the great visuals.  Sorry, Jimmy, but making Hawaii look good isn't exactly a feat of magic.<br />Oh, and for all of the liberal left out there, Cuba Gooding Jr. is tossed in for a multicultural, look-at-the-black-man moment.  His part is entirely unnecessary except to cater to the whiny crowd who'd otherwise complain about the casting.<br />Avoid this movie like the plague.  Buy Tora! Tora! Tora! and see what a real tribute to American heroes looks like.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is a superb albumn indeed! It has texture, is tasty, sweet, invigorating, astutely produced and thought out, brilliantly written and all together worth the cash!!! Cake is up there with Radiohead, my favorite band of all time, but after purchasing and listening to this albumn it's now tied with the band! I can not agree anymore with the lyrics and the irony displayed on the CD...it sets an ecletic array of moods...and there is a wide variety of fashions and styles displayed through each track...so if your in search of gold go out and dig up this CD at your local CD store or right here on Amazon...then enjoy and feel the pleasure... :) See ya!

B00005JKDQ|5.0|I go to the movies every Friday with my friends (I'm 13), and one of them said we should see Monsters Inc, because there was nothing playing, NO ONE ELSE wanted to see it. Especially me. But since there was nothing else playing, I went to see it, and it was the best movie I ever saw in my WHOLE LIFE. It was sooooooooooo good. At the end, I cried all 19 (yes 19) times I saw it. It WAS THE BESTTTTTTTT!
0380977788|5.0|A delightfully creepy story, Coraline is reminiscent of the original Grimm fairytales.  Dark, yet oddly innocent, it is a great little book.  Neil Gaiman yet again shows his mastery of the subtle horror that can seep into you and make a shiver run up your spine.
B00004STPT|5.0|Having just come from a review that was practically trashing this soundtrack, I feel a need to write my own. It seems a better idea than flying into a homicidal rage and killing something. See, that's what happens to me when people tell me my favourite CD bites. My opinion? The soundtrack is in a *jewel* case for a reason. It's simply a gem of movie music. My personal favourite tracks are #3 (The Battle), which starts with one of a thrilling sequence and gets better from there, causing my blood pressure to skyrocket rather dangerously. Another favourite is #7 (Barbarian Horde). If I thought my blood pressure was dangerously high before, that was nothing. This track is my all-time favourite piece of music on the face of the planet. It sends little thrills chasing up and down my spine, and I close my eyes and just let the music do it's thing. Who needs skydiving and bungee jumping when you have the Gladiator soundtrack? And the last three tracks (Elysium, Honour Him and Now we are Free) are beautiful, sad, ethereal and absoloutely touching. Lisa Gerrard definitely adds a touch for the better in this soundtrack, softening it with these beautiful pieces. Watch the movie, folks. Buy the soundtrack. I don't think you'll regret it.
B0000683DH|5.0|What else can be said... The quality has been restored 100% 4 minutes of footage has been added... The graphics our outstanding... They really did a decent job on this... Honest.
B000002J1M|5.0|This was released in 1972. The same year as Jethro Tull's opus &quot;Thick As A Brick,&quot; Deep Purple's &quot;Machine Head,&quot; and Yes' &quot;Fragile,&quot; and &quot;Close To the Edge.&quot; All great albums.<BR><BR>But sadly, no one really mentions this one. Which in a way is pretty cool because if everyone liked it, it would take away from the mystique the early Genesis line-up had. But, who else did &quot;Supper's Ready?&quot; No one can put 7 songs into one, all with a different style and distinction and have it be as coherent as this. Sure, many probably have tried, but no single art rock composition can quite live up to &quot;Supper's Ready.&quot; <BR><BR>I also think that &quot;Watcher of the Skies,&quot; is the perfect opening song. The mellotron is very moving, and the complex 6/4 time signature with the whole band is always something to look forward to. It also contains a cool guitar solo by the underrated Steve Hackett. &quot;Time Table,&quot; is a magnificently crafted pop piece, somewhat foreshadowing their stuff with Collins, except much better. &quot;Get Em Out By Friday,&quot; rocks! &quot;Can Utility and the Coastliners,&quot; is very volatile, going from soft to loud in about 2 minutes, all ending with a crescendo. Then there's Horizons, a classical guitar solo by Hackett. true in some songs, his guitar is barely audible, but at least he had his own solo on this album. <BR><BR>Genesis truly had an impact on art rock in the 70s, and it was this album when people began to really take notice. &quot;Nursery Cryme,&quot; was an awesome album, but this is the first Genesis albums when all of the pieces fit together perfectly.
0812932293|5.0|Branson's book is a great read. Not only do you get to step through his business buidling, but its an interesting read that keeps you turing the pages.
B000002J1O|5.0|Another great album by Genesis. The only song I really don't like on this album is &quot;More Fool Me,&quot; because of the Phil Collins vocals, which were pretty bad at the time, but lucky for you, it's very soft, and sandwiched between the baroque &quot;Firth of Fifth,&quot; with amazing flute/piano/synth/guitar solo, and the zany, 12 minute fight song &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest.&quot;<BR>Very medieval sounding, and may take a while for people to decode the British language that takes up some of the songs, such as &quot;Dancing With The Moonlit Knight.&quot; A rewarding listen for those willing to be completely awed by such complex yet beautiful compositions.
0060930349|4.0|This is a very comprehensive and detailed survey of 400 years of American History from a clearly conservative right-wing standpoint. As noted by several reviewers, the coverage of the last 50 years was not at the same level of objectivity as the rest of the book. I found it to be very useful...highly recommended for anyone who enjoys studying our heritage and how we got here.
0345350499|5.0|This has truly inspired me to a new way of thinking and helped me develop religious views in my teen years. This is book is amazing  and no one should go without reading it.  It shows truth and different perspectives of life without putting done another religion or other peoples thoughts. It leaves room more imagination and opens the readers eyes to a new world.  Not only the best book of its genre but of all time.  Read this and tell a friend.
B000068TPN|3.0|This is an excellent film. For me, I enjoyed watching how the commanders of both sides came to their decisions in the course of the battle. The scenes of the domestic front, both in America and in Vietnam, added to the pathos of the tragedy which resulted from this important battle. My points are largely for the film, and not for the supplements.<br />The DVD has three supplements - a commentary, a short film on the production of the film, and ten deleted scenes with commentary. The commentary can be repetitive. Mr. Wallace has three themes it would appear -  how magnificent his actors are, how true his movie is to the actual events, and the brilliant cinematography of his lead camera man. I found myself predicting his statements before he even uttered them.<br />The thing I missed most from this dvd is historical background into the Battle of Ia Drang Valley in 1965. The movie passes very quickly over the history of Vietnam after World War II, with a quick snapshot of the failed French campaign in the mid - 1950's to Washington ordering a massive mobilization of troops to the region in 1965. If this had been included I would have given the DVD a much higher rating.
6304712944|5.0|Unlike the critics and the customer comments i find this musical version WONDERFUL!  What puzzles me is why do people compare this title to &quot;The Kennedys.&quot; If anything that is an insult to a great motion picture. But i digress.....I find the musical numbers most fitting to the scenes that are going on with the story. My favorite is &quot;Lusty Month of May&quot; and if you have a 5.1 Stereo System this number surrounds you with beautiful music and so with &quot;If Ever i Could Leave You.&quot; My eyes tear-up terribly during that number. I don't know how anyone couldn't fall in love with this movie.Also this movie is in it's original Roadshow Format with it's arousing Round Table speech from Richard Harris as the music builds just before &quot;Intermission.&quot; It gives me chills just writing about it.Dispite the other reviews, see for yourself if this 60's musical will touch a cord with you and i don't care what people think of Vanessa Redgrave, this movie was made for her. She's brilliant!

B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan succeeds because it strikes the perfect balance of drama, action, humor, pathos, and depth. After the critical failure of the first Star Trek movie (which hit movie theaters before being properly completed), the producers took the trouble to view every episode of the original series to figure out what made it enduring.  They replicated it successfully in The Wrath of Khan. Unlike the first film, the plot is driven by the actions and motivations of the characters. This is not a story about spatial anomalies or an excuse for technobabble and flashy special effects. This story is about the classic themes which have served drama well since ancient Greek theater: the quest for vengeance; lost loves; the alienation, anger and reconciliation of fathers and sons; and the realization of mortality. Of the many science fiction films I have seen, few have tugged at the heartstrings as deeply as The Wrath of Khan. The most powerful moments are the bittersweet reunion between Kirk and Carol Marcus, the death of Spock and Kirk's eulogy, and the long delayed embrace between Kirk and his estranged son David. These moments are so universal that any \\"science fiction\\" label for this film seems limiting.<br />The script is helped by what is undoubtedly William Shatner's finest performance as James T. Kirk. Shatner brings the perfect balance of bluster, brio, and vulnerability to the aging Admiral. Toward the end of the movie, Kirk, shattered by Spock's death, tears down his defenses and allows us to see the human being behind the uniform. Ricardo Montalban, in a blood thirsty, Ahab-like performance, proves that there is much more to his acting than what was seen on Fantasy Island.<br />The special effects, which are entirely at the service of the story, for the most part hold up remarkably well--two exceptions are the Ceti Eels and the Genesis Cave Waterfall, which look rather primitive by today's CGI standards. James Horner's crisp, vibrant score hints at the great things which were to follow from him--it's a pity he has not been used in more recent Star Trek fare.<br />This Director's Edition contains some additional footage which was not in the theatrical release.  Among this are scenes which reveal why Scotty was so upset over the death of the Cadet in Engineering, as well as some minor additions.  Unlike the DVD release of the first Star Trek movie, there have been no enhancements to the few dated visual effects, such as the Genesis Cave Waterfall.  The bonus material features interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, and Bennett, as well as several behind the scenes looks at the visual effects (this was the first film to make use of computer graphics) and production design. Less interesting is an extended look at the Trek universe as seen through various novelizations (which, as every Trekker knows, are not considered \\"canon.\\")<br />The picture and sound quality are identical to the earlier DVD release, a definite improvement over VHS and laserdisc, but not spectacular by DVD standards.at the great things which were to follow from him--it's a pity he has not been used in more recent Star Trek fare. <br />This Director's Edition contains some additional footage which was not in the theatrical release.

B000062XM3|1.0|This movie make no sence at all, it's very boring.  Edward Norton act like a weak, coward guy and he look very sick, Brad Pitt act like a macho brat, I find more tolerable the acting performance of Norton then Pitt.  Norton was much better in the movie \\"American History X\\", I think he should stick to theses kind of roles and loose the weak one who make him look like a coward.  You may like this movie if you like lots of violence, lots of blood and a boring story.  At the end the movie make more sence, well a little bit but it's still very boring and another \\"Clich American Movie\\" that people will say it's cool because big names are in it, well even if \\"Movie Stars\\" are in a boring movie it's doesn't make the movie great, well not to me!
B000068TPN|4.0|Many veterans I've met have an argument about Vietnam War movies: Which one gets it right? There are some who might subscribe to \\"Platoon\\", others who said that \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" was the most accurate. I think most agree that the book this movie is based on is an outstanding resource, but the movie can't possibly include all of the details. The movie is very entertaining and doesn't quite paint the story with such a wide red, white and blue paintbrush (as with the carefully slanted \\"Black Hawk Down\\"). It is, as the documentary suggests, a story of the hatred of war, but the love of the soldier. This is a very good movie that draws appropriate attention to the American soldier, and I give it four stars for it's honesty and clarity.

You have to watch this movie sooner or later, simply because it is ranked, over and over again, the best movie ever. <br />Vanity? Sure it is. But isn't it bother you, when people talk about it all the time and you don't know what the hack? So let's just watch it and get over it. <br />I did exactly that. Well, it is a good movie. The use of lighting, the angle of the camera, blah blah blah. It just doesn't seem original to me. I guess I should blame this on the movie's originality, I mean its technologies are repeated by later movies so so many times, that its originality doesn't look original to me anymore. I guessed out what \\"rosebud\\" long before the ending, these tricks are no longer new. <br />I have the same problem with Star Wars. People keep telling me:\\"Do you know how innovative, how shocking the movie is at THAT time?\\" Yeah I can see that, but I live at THIS time and I am spoiled into having higher expectations than the people lived at THAT time, right?<br />So let's watch this wonderful movie (at THAT time) and move on with our lives.
B00005ATQ8|5.0|I won't reiterate what the other reviewers said: I can only rant that it is a sweeping tale of a lifetime: and one of my very favorite films ever. It is beautiful, moving, and brilliant.<br />gris=^.^=
B000069HKH|5.0|Is it too early in the life of &quot;The Rising&quot; to say something as broad as &quot;Bruce's greatest collection of songs, bar none&quot;? It's a rare CD that improves and grows and expands with each listen. With radio and music television boxing artists into ever-constricting formats, Springsteen's latest stands alone as plainly and simply a great, great rock album. This record, and the tour (which I've seen two nights of), are premium samplings of a music legend at the absolute top of his form. Satisfying on every level, easily the best CD I've bought in years.
B0000640VO|5.0|Jean-Pierre, will you marry me? The man is genius personified.<br />I love this film, its brilliant use of color, and Yann Tiersen's soundtrack is the icing on the cake.
B000003C5C|5.0|This is a great metal album.  Chuck Shuldiner was a musical genius.   If you like speed or thrash metal and you are looking to get into death metal, immediately buy this album.  That's the way it happened for me.  Anyway, this album is heavy and great.  The riffs are similar to Slayer at times, only heavier.  The riffs are great.  The solos are awesome, and they are in every song.  The vocals on this album are great, Chuck is still my favorite Death metal vocalist.  He is much better than the guys from Cannibal Corpse or any other death metal band.  My favorite songs would have to be \\"Leprosy\\", \\"Pull the Plug\\", \\"Primitive Ways\\" and \\"Choke On It\\", but they are all great, and there's no filler.  Basically, if you're into thrash/death metal, there is no way you can go wrong with this album.  It was sad to hear about Chuck's death, and even though I've only recently discovered Death, I will miss him. R.I.P. Chuck
1856958000|5.0|Combine a great reader with a great author and you can't go wrong. The style of comedy employed in these books reminds me of the Xanth series by Piers Anthony. I especially love \\"The Luggage.\\" You certainly can't go wrong by reading just one of these to see if you want to continue the series. You just might find out why it's so popular
0553801481|5.0|If you're normally a Terry Brooks devoutee..... Try this book/author for a change of pace... and what a change of pace it is.<br />I love the stories spun by Mr. Brooks.  This lady seperates herself by quickly introducing you to characters and building the story in the current book.  Mr. Brooks' books tend to want to take you back to the salient points of characters lives from previous reading.  As a result his books generally are good reads but slow for the first 9 of 12 chapters and bang chapters 10, 11 and 12 come and your blown away.  Not this book. THIS BOOK MOVES!!!!!!!!!!!!  FROM BEGINNING TO END<br />I feel as though if I say anything about the story I'll give something away.  I will say one thing.... Robin nice job with the sex scene ;).  One other thing, my wife is generally a grocery store book of the week reader and she steps into the cerebral stuff with her historical masterpieces (800 - 900 page training weights) covering some famous figure or event.  She read one chapter of this book and had to have her own.  I hope you enjoy it too.
0880389052|3.0|After asking some of my friends to recommend fantasy authors, several mentioned Salvatore and, in particular, the Dark Elf Trilogy. I have read (and reviewed) the Cleric Quintet, and now, having finished my sixth Salvatore novel, I think I understand his style. <br />Salvatore sets most of his novels in the the world of the Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game. Of course, there is a considerable difference between playing D&D and reading a novel. I find myself forced to agree with some of the other reviewers here that I could anticipate much of the plot development in advance. The characters lack of depth is clearly seen; they are evil and that is all there is to it. Ambiguity in this sense is almost always important to such story telling.<br />The idea of the one lone character struggling against a whole society or organization that has corrupted or is corrupt is also one of the premises in the Cleric Quintet series. There is some difference between the two, but it was mildly disappointing to see the same idea reused.<br />What I found most intriguing about this novel is the same thing I find intriguing in many different science fiction and fantasy novels. It is the world that the author paints as the background. Drizzt, the main character, is a male dark elf who lives in a fiercely matriarchal society. This is quite unusual in a genre that is frequently dominated by male heroes. There is also the idea that the entire society lives underground in the \\"Underdark\\" of the world. There were a few other things that were of interest in the novel, such as the trials and tribulations that Drizzt undergoes growing up in a drow (dark elf) society.<br />I think I enjoyed this novel more than much of the Cleric Quintet series (\\"Nightmasks\\" was something of an exception), because the Cleric Quintet seemed to have too many battles (part of that was that nature of the story, but reading about battle after battle can be a little numbing).
B00005QIPH|4.0|At first I was skeptical of course, and after seeing there video for \\"Last Night\\" I thought, well, they .... But after hearing all this hype I decided to give them another chance, and I'm happy to say that I was pleasently surprised. I usually listen to heavy metal to nu-metal so, as you can expect, this is a change for me. Have I been converted to a fan? You bet. <br />It's not as if this music is revolutionary or something unique, because it isn't. It's very simple rock, that gets you thinkin back to the old days. However, unique or not, it's very addicting and fun to listen to. I think I listened to \\"The Modern Age\\" about seven times in a row the first time. Yes, it's that cool. So, learning from me, all you gotta do is give The Strokes a chance, and you may become a fan as I have. <br />Try listening to these songs first, they are my favorite: \\"The Modern Age\\", \\"Last Night\\", \\"Hard to Explain\\" and \\"Soma.
B000065U1N|5.0|To start things off, this film is not for faint of heart or weak of stomach. It is completely unbiased in its visual splendor and cuts no corners in telling the truth about modern war. If you have seen Saving Private Ryan imagine the opening sequence prolongued for an additional two hours and you will have Black Hawk Down. The nonstop action does not cut from the character storylines, a feat I think R. Scott pulled off very well. There is no real character development (J. Harshnett attempts this in his ending speech) but that is because this film is non-fiction and is centered around the battled in Mogadishu. The music is excellent, when it is allowed to be heard. Most of the time Hans Zimmer's score is very subdued, so as not to detract from the visual action. The one complaint that I have about the DVD is the absence of a special features. There are some, but they are uninspired and not in abundance. Overall, this is a fine film deserved to be seen in widescreen with the finest tools available.
B000002J2B|5.0|Wind &amp; Wuthering, Genesis's second album with Phil Collins as lead singer is an absolutely beautiful album. I'm still in the beginning stages of digging into the early recordings of this incredible band so I can't really compare this to the Peter Gabriel era albums but what I can say is that Wind &amp; Wuthering is a great album. Sure the production can be a bit muddy at times but brushing that aside this 1976 album is truly inspiring and has a mysterious quality. The album cover art with the grey sky &amp; and brown leaves sets the general mood of the album. While it might not quite rank as high as Trick Of The Tail or Invisible Touch IMO it truly is arty and creative. Sometimes I even would like to take a break from the slickness of Invisible Touch(Don't get me wrong I love that album alot) and listen to the more abtuse LPs. There are some first signs of a few New Wave sounds on a few songs but overall the music is raw and not polished excessively. Some of the tracks especially the bizarre Wot Gorilla? can be a bit too abstract for those whose tastes are more based on Invisible Touch or We Can't Dance fanbase and this CD might not be the best to appreciate for the steadfast 80s or 90s Genesis fanbase but for those who want to get more adventurous this CD is one to have in your Genesis collection. It won't be the easiest album to digest at first but ultimately it will become an indespensible CD in your collection. I personally feel almost like I'm the only one who actually enjoys just about everything by Genesis including this, Trick Of The Tail and then the more polished sounds of Invisible Touch &amp; We Can't Dance and the darker rockier sounds of the swansong Valling All Stations. Genesis truly are among the best bands ever no doubt about it.
6305428425|4.0|A high school reunion can be many different things to different people, and those who attend one do so for a variety of reasons.  For some, it's a return to the \\"glory days;\\" for others, it can be a masochistic attempt to purge the memories of a past they'd rather forget, but cannot; still others will go seeking vindication and/or retribution for real or imagined injuries suffered at the hands of juvenile miscreants during the formative years.  Then there are those who will go out of simple curiosity (\\"I wonder what so-and-so looks like now?) or just because it sounds like it might be fun.  And then there are those who would rather have red hot coals pressed into their eye sockets than show up at such a shindig.  Call it different strokes for different folks; but whatever you call it, you're going to meet all of these and more, in \\"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,\\" directed by David Mirkin, a light comedy that indicates that the past may have, indeed, been everything you thought it was, and more-- but that perhaps you just hadn't seen it clearly at the time.  And, upon returning to the scene of the crime, as it were, you discover that ten years of maturing and endlessly revisiting certain school days situations in your mind can do to your perception of it what laser surgery on the eyes can do for a myopic-- for maybe the first time in your life, you can actually see everything crystal clear, and the way it really was back in \\"The day.\\"<br />It's been ten years since lifetime friends Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) graduated from high school, left Small Town, U.S.A. and headed for L.A., where their respective endeavors have at last taken them both to the very top of the minimum wage pay scale.  When the news of their ten-year reunion comes down the pike to them, they're excited and want to go.  Upon reflection, however, it occurs to them that returning to an environment that was less than accepting of them a decade ago, without having accomplished anything more than successfully drawing breath on a daily basis, could possibly be construed as the proverbial fools errand.  They'd just be setting themselves up for the likes of perpetual Prom Queen Christy Masters (Julia Campbell) and her \\"top of the `in-crowd'\\" cronies (all of whom are sure to be in attendance) to once again come in for the kill.  Not a happy prospect.<br />Romy and Michele, however, have learned a couple of things since high school (and probably no more than that; it's why they're where they are today), and they put their heads together and concoct a plan through which they will finally obtain that which has always eluded them:  The cherished esteem of their peers (and most especially, that of  Christy Masters and her cohorts).  And it's so simple-- all they have to do is attend the reunion as a pair of successful businesswomen!  They even come up with the kind of business they're \\"in,\\" just on the off-chance someone should ask (what are the chances of that!).  It's a brilliant plan, it's foolproof and it's going to be fun.  And with that, Romy and Michele are off to their high school reunion.<br />Light comedy, like a meal consisting of \\"lite\\" ingredients, can be a delicious and satisfying treat for the cinematic palate.  When properly prepared and dished up in just the right proportions, it can be a cause for celebration; and Mirkin's film is just that-- a cause for celebration.  It's well crafted and delivered, works on a number of different levels and will appeal to a wide audience, inasmuch as the subject of the film is one to which most people are going to be able to identify and relate, and on a very personal basis, at that.  Without question, personal experience and individual frame of reference are going to determine how this one is received, and on which level; and it will hinge on which group from among those listed above in paragraph one the viewer falls into.  For some, this film is going to be fun-- taken at face value by the curious who just want a few laughs-- and they won't be disappointed, because this is funny stuff.  For others, however, beyond the surface humor, it may tap into some dark corners of the psyche, revealing things that have been repressed, possibly, but not forgotten.  And regardless to which group the viewer belongs, it will be those with a keen sense of perception that will understand that this is a comedy with some very serious underpinnings.<br />Again, it's the personal experience and frame of reference that will come into play here.  Those of a more superficial bent will see Romy and Michele as prime targets to be set up and used for fun; mere objects of derision held aloft for the merriment of others.  The more astute will recognize the cruelty enacted upon them for just what it is:  Cruelty.  And it's a sad fact that for many-- the \\"real\\" Romys and Micheles of the world-- the price of the education received in high school was high, indeed:  Tuition paid in psychological scars carried-- in too many instances-- throughout the remainder of one's life; scars born of the cruelty meted out by the \\"perfect\\" upon those deemed \\"unworthy\\" of acceptance in the prevailing social order.  Heavy stuff for a \\"light\\" comedy?  Perhaps.  But it's what makes this film so good; it entertains-- Sorvino and Kudrow together?  Forget about it, they're terrific-- but it also makes you think.  And, hopefully, it will encourage the \\"real\\" Christy Masters' of the world to pause and reflect upon past deeds and \\"judgments\\" handed down in the throes of juvenile self-righteousness.  \\"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\\" is funny-- very funny-- but it also says something that is genuinely worth saying.
B000001ESF|5.0|The title track of 2112 is by far the heaviest and most complex composition Rush ever recorded. Peart's lyrics and drums are amazing on this song, along with Lifeson's best guitar work ever and Lee's rythmic bass and voicals. They prooved that they had staying power and were more then a Zeppelin copy. The growth in their music started with the album \\"Fly By Night\\", with the addision of Peart on drums and his writing, the band started to make their traid mark \\" thinking mans rock\\". But in this their 4th LP, it came together. The whole album is great!! Something For Nothing is my favorite Rush song. They have changed their sound a couple of times over the years, but to me they have yet to produce a better album then 2112.
0761957553|5.0|Easy to read but very thorough. Doesn't just tell you how to use the menus, but walks you through the entire statistical process. Spends a lot of time teaching you how to check your statistical assumptions, which is so important. Book has been invaluable to me, both for using SPSS and for improving my statistical skills. Sections on GLM techniques and regression are particularly good.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|It's true that this movie is brutal and harrowing by the end, (one friend's review of the movie was \\"It's great, but when the title 'Winter' comes up, I recommend just running out of the theater screaming then. It'll save time.\\"), leading many to say one would never want to see it a second time.<br />Perhaps, but the movie is made so well, that it really does reward multiple viewings. Also, the commentary tracks provided by the director and cinematographer are interesting and do a good job of pointing out subtleties of craft that you may not have consciously picked up on when viewing on your own.<br />I have my quibbles with the film, and suspect the ending is a little too Grand Guignol-ish for its own good, but the all-around solid-to-amazing acting, the musical approach to editing and composition, and the creativity and innovation of the director make this one a keeper for me.
0345403959|5.0|To me, Eddings, like Tad Williams and Raymond E. Feist, writes a kind of perfect fantasy story that harkens back to Lloyd Alexander and the Chronicles of Prydain. It's not what I reach for when I want something trying to be deep and profound, it's what I reach for when I want something completely satisfying. A well written, believable world you can instantly fall into, and want to. Marvelous characters that you want to meet again and again. Stories that hook you early, pace nicely, and keep you hooked til the end. Which is not to imply these books are shallow or merely escapist; but rather that every level on which they can be read meshes so effortlessly that you aren't ever interrupted by your awareness of them. The best storytellers are the ones who never draw attention to themselves, because that draws attention away from the story - they never shout at you through the page. Eddings is a master storyteller, and it was very gratifying to get Belgariad prequels long after you thought the series was, sadly, complete. Both Belgarath and Polgara are excellent reads. If you like The Belgariad and Mallorean books, make sure to read the Servant of the Empire trilogy (written with Janny Wurts) as well!

B00000JGEH|5.0|Time travel can be hard to comprehend but that's part of what makes this movie so good.  The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) and Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) have traveled to the year 1985 from the year 2029.  The Terminator is programmed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Reese has come back to save her.  The reason why; she will have a son who will help humans  destroy the machines that rule the planet in the future after nuclear war.  The Terminator's job is to kill her to prevent this and Reese's job is to stop the Terminator.  The action is super charged and the Terminator, seemingly unstoppable because he is only a machine, appears human, and is a force to be reckoned with.  Sarah has a real hard time believing Reese when he explains to her what is happening but as events continue she realizes what he is telling her is true.  If Sarah only had an unlisted number...
B000000OQF|5.0|To me this albums is one of the godfathers of the metal genre. Like it's predessesors Master Of Puppets and Led Zeppelin 4 this album is constantly an inspiration to me. While beautiful is proberly not the correct world to describe the collection of expicit lyrics and acid riffs, The music is amazingly crafted and polished whilst still retain a \\"we do what we want to feel about it\\", and to me that truly is something special.<BR>The bass in each of the songs is infectious and often ablibbed with numerous fills added in to add to the music. The Drums flow in well but it's really slash's guitar work that carries the album home. Each solo fits the mold set by each song perfectly plus his riffs rank as some of the most ingenious ever.<BR>Whilst Axl Rose my not be the greatest singer in the world, you can't help but love his style and grace that he pulls of his often sexually explicit lyrics with.<BR>All of this plus more result in Appetite For Destruction being one of the finest albums ever.Period.
0316666343|5.0|Captivated by critical praise and a supernatural plot, I was a bit skeptical that any book could live up to its structural and pop culture status.  &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; met and exceeded all of my expectations and then some.  Sebold brings forth a spectrum of emotions that are both difficult to express and yet thrilling to any reader who's experienced sheer joy from the written page.  Our heroine, a heaven-bound adolescent is ripped away(literally and figuratively) from earth and its bounty of family, friends and real life pleasures.  Looking down from above, with newfound wisdom and more than a few regrets, the narrator steers us through a web of self-dicovery, within her self, her family, and even, within us - her audience.  Sebold manages to weave a bold mosaic of sorrow and joy, disaster and bliss, with words that simply take your breath away so that you find yourself re-reading passages just to be enveloped in their magical truth again and again.  This is simple yet important prose...at once whimsical and deep.  It's the sort of book that makes you think twice about the choices we have, the ones we make, and the ones we might later regret not choosing.  <br />My only wish is that Hollywood leave this novel alone and refrain from attempting to replicate its sincere qualities on-screen.  No screenplay, or director, or acting ensemble could supplant the power of &quot;the Bones'&quot; narrative.  Destined to become a perennial favorite, the &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; is best left to the senses and the imagination that captivates readers in unique, individual ways.  Buy it, share it, cherish it!
0679736646|4.0|If Phillip K. Dick were to rise from his grave today, he would probably peruse the current state of `alternative entertainment' with a knowing smirk.  The dominant themes Dick mined in his thirty-year career - including alien invasions, time/reality distortion, psychoactive illness, drug abuse, paranoia, metaphysical yearning - have been used and reused so much in the last decade that `alternative entertainment' now has a solid niche in the mainstream.  Note the recent success (in theater or video) of Momento, The Matrix, Mulholland Drive, Fight Club, etc.  Dick's own work has been drafted for the mainstream buck from time to time, as well, though usually in clipped or totally reworked format, _Total Recall_ being a good example of the former, _Blade Runner_ of the latter. <br />I state the above because it helps to read some of Dick's sci-fi with strong hindsight; to realize that when Dick was writing it, there was nothing else like it.  Such is the case with _Ubik_.  For though this book suffers from some typical Dick sloppiness (two dimensional characters, lazy grammar, a meandering plot that almost made me throw the book down in disgust - ) the core ideas Dick introduces and uses were undoubtedly radical for its time, far beyond cliché or contrived conflict.  <br />The specifics: Glen Runciter is the owner of an `anti-psi' organization, which roots out errant telepaths and protects the `unevolved' layman from mental sabotage.  After Runciter is slain by a business competitor, his gifted employees scramble to keep the company afloat...then scramble to stay alive, for reality itself seems to be disintegrating before their very eyes.  Stranger still, Runciter's face appears on money; he (or his ghost, perhaps?) leaves surreal messages on the walls of bathroom stalls.  Is Runciter dead? Or is everyone else? And how does the universal panacea Ubik figure into all of this?<br />_Ubik_ is not one of Dick's better novels.  The characters are dull; many interesting ideas are quickly introduced and just as quickly discarded; the whole middle section of the book is a bit of a slog.  But the ending redeems the effort spent, as everything falls into place - almost.  <br />All in all, a good mind-bender for a summer afternoon.  Four stars.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Having Just finished a World War II Tour of Europe, I just can't figure out how a country that produced a Goethe, a Beethoven and a Bach could also commit the monstrous acts that it did during WW II.  This film shows the hold that Adolf Hitler had on the people of Germany during his rise to full power during the 30's. It is a masterfully made film.  The opening sequence of Hitler's  plane descending from the clouds to land in Nuremburg proclaims Hitler as a Messiah coming to earth to redeem Germany, and, indeed, would have had an enormous impact on the German people of this period.  However, the film is truly frightening to me.  I visited Buchenwald on the tour.  I viewed the \\"shower stalls\\" and the ovens.  It is overwhelming seeing this film in the light of that visit.  However, it is well worth viewing, although I cannot say that I enjoyed it.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Compared to the single disc original DVD, this new 2-disc set adds a half hour documentary and another commentary track with three of the actors from the film. In addition, the transfer on the new version is significantly better than the original. It's definitely on par with Superbit releases. While it may look a tad grainier than the original, you can see added detail. On a large projection TV it's definitely noticeable. So if you're a big fan of the film, I totally recommend picking up this new version. <br />Also, the new commentary track with Casper van Dien, Dina Meyer, and Doogie Howzer is just hilarious.  Director Verhoeven is on it, too, but he mainly keeps his mouth shut and lets the actors talk about lots of funny anecdotes.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Given the 3 song EP, and the MP3's of the older unavailable stuff (Chemikal UG EP, self-released stuff)- the bar was set high for the band's full length debut.  Success- it has been cleared. Wearing there influences proudly on their collective sleeves (Joy Division/New Order, Smiths, MBV, et. al.), Interpol merges slashing, layered, repetitive guitar lines, with beautiful soaring &amp; similtaneously brooding baselines for stunning effects. They have somehow developed a sound that is their own (i.e. Clinic too) without sounding too derivative (exception- Say Hello to the Angels- very smiths/jam sounding....)  Stand out tracks are both 'Obstacles', Hands Away, Roland, and The New.  If you can get any of their older unreleased songs (Song Seven, Precipitate) these are equally compelling (if not stronger) listens.  Their first radio interview/session is at KCRW's website under 'Morning Becomes Eclectic'.  Plus- PFM gave it a 9.5 also- 'believe the hype'.....
B0000683DH|4.0|Of all the movies to pick to write a final paper about, I chose Star Trek II. The best of the Trek films (I'd put VI in second place), I was stunned to find that this movie I watched over and over growing up had an incredibly moving and thoughtful subtext when I watched it again in college.<br />ST II has some of the best moments in the long history of Star Trek, including what I feel to be Kirk's two greatest moments in his two confrontations with Khan. But the strategies and explosions aside (and those are great in this flick), it goes much deeper.<br />I invite everyone to rewatch The Wrath of Khan purely for the parable about aging, death, and rebirth. Kirk's final words (which I won't reveal here) on the bridge of the Enterprise bring the parable full circle. The film is remarkably deep, I continue to be surprised.<br />Finally, a quick note about the Director's Cut DVD -- it is a gem. The video and audio transfers are great, and definitely take advantage of 5.1 digital surround at a few points in the movie. The picture quality is quite good, and improves by leaps and bounds over that widescreen VHS and the early DVD. The extras are interesting to a point -- the old trailer is hilariously bad, but I could easily do without the \\"Hi, I'm a professional Trekkie\\" short film. It felt like being cornered for 20 minutes by the guy wearing Spock ears at a Trek convention.<br />Overall, I am pleased to recommend this new packaging of Star Trek II on DVD. I think you will be pleased and, when you look a bit deeper into the film, moved.
B000002C1V|1.0|First of all I will say that I am a fan of all members of Pink Floyd, so I am not pro Rogers or pro Gilmour.<br />However, this album is musically weak just as A Momentary Lapse Of Reason for the simply reason both these albums lack the true Pink Floyd sound. Gone were Richard Wright's keyboards that helped mark that true Pink Floyd sound through albums prior.<br />The lyrical brilliance of Roger and guitar of Gilmour still remained however this alone is not enough to carry this album.  I do not enjoy sitting through this album to hear the lyrics if the music does not back them up.
B00000612P|5.0|This album just gets better each time I listen to it. Hard to believe Rod was once great, but he was and this album is proof.<BR>There are just so many great little moments on it, like in the title cut when Rod and Maggie Bell can't wait for the music to sing the line \\"look how wrong you can be\\". They are that into the song, and when was the last time you heard something like that on any album as of late?<BR>The real secret weapon on this disc is drummer Mick Waller, no disrespect to Ron Wood. He gets called a sloppy drummer a lot, but he brings so much life to these songs, especailly his thunderous playing on \\"I Know I'm Losing You\\".<BR>I have the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab disc, and if you can find it, GET IT. The sound is unbelievable; you'd swear Rod and crew were right in front of you.
B000067CPX|3.0|I'm not a long-time Peppers fan. I did like Blood Sugar, liked One Hot Minute, and absolutely loved Californication. I liked some of their earlier stuff, too. No matter what era of Peppers' music you are into (or all of them), this one's pretty different. It's overall pretty mellow, with a couple exceptions. Very easy to listen to. \\"By the Way\\" is a great tune, sort of classic Peppers.  \\"Can't Stop\\" is an awesome Frusciante funk guitar tune. \\"Zephyr\\" is a great song, totally unlike anything they've done (as well as \\"Cabron\\" and a couple others). I did miss the big Flea bass parts...they just seem absent.<br />All in all, it's a very good album, but personally I wanted it to be a little more rocking and funky. Listen to it first!
B000002UAX|5.0|What is there to say???  This is, simply, the very best of the Beatles!
B000066AXC|3.0|a beautiful mind is a typical hollywood movie. nothing spectacular about it. they took a good book (in this case biography) about an interesting man, altered it to a ron howard type of film, and then made it and awarded it. there are some good performances, but they only brushed what it could have been. i won't say don't watch it, it is ok, and will pass the time, but it isn't something i would rush out and buy.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This movie is the best movie yet to come out, all the movie fanatics have no choice but to agree, the graphics are awsom the sound, the action, and the plot WOW I see no reason why pretty much anyone would have a problem with it.  The most important thing of all if you just happen to have a heart condition of any kind I would not recomend this movie and that goes the same for realy small kids because mainly of just this one quick part in the movie that would make your heart skip a beat, well anywho hope you enjoy.
6305177473|5.0|I am a big fan of family/children's movies, but this is one of my very favorites of all time. Lindsay Lohan sparkles as Annie/Hallie...the casting for every last role was nothing less than perfect. The casting directors definitely deserve two thumbs up for a job well done with this movie.<br />I have seen the Haley Mills (original) Parent Trap dozens of times (my favorite scene is and always has been, of course, the \\"Let's Get Together\\" duet), but the new version really takes the cake. I really like the story line and the way the screenwriters/directors/etc. encorporated the original into this story. For example, when Hallie (or is it Annie) is humming/singing \\"Let's Get Together\\" in the elevator...I thought that was a wonderful way to connect this story to the original without it being blunt and in-your-face. <br />Lohan's Parent Trap easily gets 5 stars from both me AND my husband. Yes, this is one of my husband's favorite movies as well! He was very pleasantly surprised by the charm and sentimentality of this movie and he also loved the casting/acting. Normally, our taste in movies (with the exception of animated Disney movies) is so incredibly different (I like suspense/thrillers and crime dramas whereas he prefers comedies and action movies) but we both ADORE this movie to pieces!<br />If you liked the original, you'll LOVE the remake (I wouldn't even call it a remake because this movie has it's own story line...it's the same general idea, but the stories are pretty different).
B000002LMK|5.0|This baby rocks like a demon from beginning to end.  Push play and listen to the magic guitars grind you into heaven.  It's great for those times when you need to do chores around the house or need a boost to get you through the day.  This is one of those CD's you can listen to OVER AND OVER again and still be begging for more.  If you like great rock and roll, this is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL, even if you're not a Neil Young fan.
0312265859|1.0|This is the first of the Stephanie Plum series which I've read, and I have to say it didn't inspire me to go back and read the previous seven books. Set in the Jersey 'burbs, the book (and series) features Stephanie, an apparently thirtiesh bounty hunter of incredible ineptness and poor luck, working for her cousin Vinny's bail bond service. In this stale story, she has two main tasks, to bring in a wife-beater who didn't show up in court, and to help her parent's neighbor find her daughter and granddaughter.<br />Nothing in the book has any originality to it. Stephanie's neighborhood, the \\"'Burg\\" is standard issue, people all know each others business, strangers in the neighborhood are immediately known, and everyone talks tough, etc... Stephanie's two romantic possibilities are cardboard cutouts, the first is a dog-owning hunky nice guy next door type who clearly loves her and is good for her but for some inexplicable reason (maybe delved into in previous books?) she doesn't want to be with. And then there's the laughable Ranger, a tempting slice of mysterious Latino love, with apparently unlimited funds and resources. Considering Stephanie is a clumsy fool the whole book, it's not clear to me why either would be all that interested in her.<br />Evanovich seems to be overrelying on the \\"spunkiness\\" of her main character to hold our attention. Certainly, no real-life bounty hunter could make as many basic mistakes and destroy so much property without getting serious hurt and losing their license. It's not just that she's inept, she doesn't ever seem to learn from previous mistakes, which just makes her annoying.<br />The supporting cast of characters lends a small sliver of humor to the proceedings, mainly via Stephanie's tagalong partners, \\"robust black ex-hooker Lulu and puppy-dog correspondence lawyer Albert. Still, most of the attempts at humor are driven by Stephanie's incredible poor luck, repetition (how many cars and handcuffs will she lose?), and so forth. As for the main story about the missing woman and daughter, it's poorly handled from the get go, and only becomes more eye-rolling when her nemesis during her search turns out to be a mad Mafioso type whose dialogue seems cribbed from that of Fat Tony on \\"The Simpsons\\" (only not as funny).<br />Evanovich isn't a good enough writer to bring interesting characters to the table, nor is she a good enough comic writer to make that work, nor is she adept at creating any romantic tension, and forget her crime writing abilities. In sum, the whole thing is too trite for words and a total waste of time..

B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is U2's best album, the best album made after 1980, and ultimately one of the most rewarding listening experiences possible. Every track is excellent, and some approach perfection. Zoo Station and Even Better Than The Real Thing are an electronic adrenaline rush to open the album. That's followed by the beautiful One, a sublime song. Three more strong tracks than the lyrically jumping The Fly, which has a great sonic ambience. Mysterious Ways is another up tempo, great song, with a catchy chorus. In the last three tracks, the album provides its greatest songs, particularly Acrobat, which is my favorite U2 song. Light My Way is a great anthem, and Love is Blindness is a nice down tempo closer. My only complaint is the order on Love is Blindness and Acrobat should have been reveresed, but other than that, this is the real thing, it's even better than the real thing.
0811826848|5.0|This is one of the best Beatle books ever! The first few times I read it, I looked at the pictures because there are so many. It is full of wonderful information about the Beatles from the Beatles themselves. Everytime I read it, I retain some new information, there's so much in it. The book has many pages and little type, but if you read it, you won't be disappointed. So, if you love the Beatles, this is the ultimate book.
0316666343|5.0|I do not know why some readers berate Alice Sebold and &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;. What does it take? I would think it would  be quite riveting for all, especially those who have ever lost a loved one. The way Alice Sebold presented the entire book within the framework of a fantasy, beginning in heaven, is wonderful. It reminds me of the well known Christmas fiction movie &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; by Frank Capra, and the lesser known postmodern nonfiction book &quot;West Point...&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. If you enjoy &quot;Heavenly&quot; presentations of wonderful stories like these, you should certainly find that Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is heavenly.
B000068TPN|1.0|This movie is so thick with sugary, gooey and contrived sentiment you'll wish the dentist was sitting right next to you to clean your teeth when it's all over.  There is not one thing they \\"got right\\" with this movie.  When I see movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill, I am reminded of what great filmmaking involving the Vietnam War can be.  For an author to outright say Hollywood has never produced one film about the Vietnam War with ultimate correctness, I am appalled by the accusation since those last three films I just mentioned have gone on to be some of the most powerful and gripping films of our time-not to mention of the Vietnam War!  After watching \\"We were soldiers,\\" the directors and writers use every cliche in the book (including cliches innovated from those three films) to tell a story that has been told a million times before and with far better innovation than this tripe of a film!<br />Let me say this without reservation;  I am in the US Navy and quite simply, watching something like this angers me because it tries too hard to convey a message without taking the really hard roads to tell it.  It's almost presented with too much ease and not enough grit and grime.  I will say, there is one scene where the grit and grime come really close-when Barry Peppers character tries to lift one of his buddies to safety only to accidently pull off charred legs from Nepalm-it's gripping and shocking and the look on Barry Peppers face is brilliant.  Barry Pepper is a really great actor and quite frankly he really holds up a really small and strong character throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I quickly ended up breaking in laughter watching bacon boy look ridiculous with all the obvious layers of make up that was supposed to look like a charred face.<br />After watching the \\"making of\\" documentary on the DVD, my assumptions were correct when they show you a plethora of wardrobe for Mr. Gibson who wore dozens of different uniforms to show the wear and tear of the event.  C'MON!  Why not just have Mel Gibson in one uniform for the entire thing?  Do you see what Hollywood is trying to do here folks?  It's not reality and it's not realistic, it's just a bunch of guys in front of a camera playing war games only with a bunch of caterers standing by and slick and expensive production designl. Even worse, no heartfelt emotion anywhere!<br />The DVD itself poses almost no extras (not even a trailer) and is a letdown considering this movie was a major upset and only raked in a measly 60 million at the box office.  This movie cost almost twice that and I don't see them really making up the cost anywhere on this DVD version.  I am kinda glad this movie didn't go too far.  It doesn't deserve to.  After watching brilliant war films like Saving Private Ryan (depicting WW2) and Black Hawk Down (Gulf War), you know that the story of Vietnam has been appropriately done somewhere else after watching \\"We Were Soldiers.\\"wear and tear of the event.

B00006G8G1|5.0|For all of those who are looking for the best metal concert to see, your in for a total treat by buying this. What your going to find here isnt slayer, metallica or other talentless, pointless metal. Your going to find real heavy metal, real music. Not glamrock, not posers or mallcore, and definitely not sell outs. It has 3 metal guitarists who simply rule this dvd, and im including Jannick Gers, alot of people will be writing bs saying, Get rid of Jannick, he is terrible, not very good, he ruins the classics. Come on people wake up!! If maiden thought that then they wouldve got rid of him. Jannick is not Adrian Smith, and doesnt intend to be, while Adrian isnt Jannick. He isnt going anywhere, he's been in the band for over 12 years now, and has worked too hard to have to just quit or get fired. Im sure that made alot of you angry, but you know its the truth, just get over it. If you dont think Jannick is that great of a guitarist, then just try to play his guitar work, and youll see what a guitar wizard or god is all about. It is certainly these guys, including jannick. Dave and Jannick change their style alot around live on the solos, because it adds flavor and doesnt make the solo's boring to play, I mean imagine having to play the same solo's every night for 7 months on tour, that would get tiring, so they add new ideas to it, and its still in the same format and everything. Dave will tell you that on the interview here.<br />People will also say Bruce has lost his voice or isnt as good, while you know deep down Bruce has never sounded better with maiden. This is far better then live after death, maiden have rocked like never before. Who cares if their all in their 40's-50's, they still live heavy metal. Even Bruce said so himself in an interview in metal edge. The band played alot better on rio then live after death,, and added more text to the songs, including the solos. Bruce even sang much better on this, since he was trashed singing on live after death, hedidnt sound that hot. <br />Production wise, well thats all a matter of opinion. Nicko's drums sound very solid and tight, while he bashes the hell out of them like loose cannons, Steve Harris's bass sounds outstanding blending with 3 guitars, its still lightning intense. ALl 3 guitars are right on target production wise. I myself can hear all 6 of these guys perfectly, so anyone else who thinks otherwise, thats just your opinion. OK well anyway, this DVD is quite amazing, an outstanding show with an outstatning band. Disc 2 is a total treat too, which has interviews with each member of the band, and some cool photos taken. It really is cool, and youll get a better fan's eye view on what the maiden boys like to do besides music. All in all, weather you like it or not, this is amazing. It isnt Powerslave, it isnt 7th son, or live after death, its Iron Maiden. That is it, that is all. Keep up the great work you metal guys. Hail the true metal gods!!! Eddie Lives!!! UP THE IRONS!!!
B0000000LI|4.0|This is a good instrumental CD. Yanni Preformes live at the Acropolis in Greece. Yanni is playing piano with full orchestral accompaniment. The CD opens with the firery Santorini, The next traxck is the beautiful Keys to imagination with its beautiful string accompaniment, The tracks vary from driving instementals to mellow instrumentals. Yanni has proven himself to be an excellent contemporary pianist and composer.
B0000060NF|5.0|Though this masterpiece is over 30 years old, its concerns and issues are probably even more relevant today.  Our environment is still under attack (\\"Mercy Mercy Me\\"), our young people are still in danger (\\"What's Going On,\\" \\"What's Happening Brother\\"), and drugs are still rampant (\\"Flying High in the Friendly Sky\\").  Musically, it hasn't aged a day.  It's still fresher than the bagels down the street and will sadly probably ALWAYS be relevant.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I just bought the C.D and love it.  I have never really liked this type of music, but when I heard the first song I was instantly hooked.  She has an amzaing voice.  There are so many great tracks on this C.D.  It is defintely a great buy.  The best C.D I have bought this year!!!!
0385503954|3.0|Atonement requires great patience to read.  Its author, an established and respected writer, takes great pain to write intelligently, stylishly, with an occasional abstruse reference to impress his colleagues and readers, I suppose.  McEwan subject is scintillating, interesting, and would surely engage the reader were it not for the author's obvious attention to the written word, which steals the reader's attention from the issues introduced in this work.  Nonetheless, McEwan is good enough at his profession that you'll want to read his latest effort, in spite of its failings.

B000002NHN|5.0|I have nothing but praise for Loreena McKennitt. I was born in Scotland, and it reminds me of the music my Nana used to play. Listening to her, you can envision the moors and the fields of heather in the Scottish Highlands. She does justice to the Celtic people with her music. May she sing forever.
B00006690G|4.0|I borrowed this CD from a friend, and ripped about 7 or 8 songs from it. (Sorry Em).  But I do have the Marshall Mathers LP and Slim Shady LP, and I have to say that this is the most personal and introspective of his albums.  By now we've all heard the first single, \\"Without Me\\", probably the most accessible track on the CD, its a more ticked off version of \\"The Real Slim Shady\\".  Most of the other tracks are catchy, funky, angry, intelligent raps.  Dr. Dre has never sounded better, and Slim himself improves as a producer (nothing sounds as bad as \\"Renagade\\" that he produced for Jay-Z)  MY favorite tracks are<BR>Business, Cleanin Out my closet, Sing for the Moment, Without Me, White America, Till I Collapse (f/ Nate Dogg) and When the Music Stops (f/ D12).  Its not as maniacal as the Slim Shady LP, and not as funny as The Marshall Mathers LP, but for anyone who thought Eminem was an MTV pop product with MMLP, this album proves them completely wrong.
0316666343|4.0|I usually don't read novels, especially first novels, but I decided to read The Lovely Bones after glancing online at the first chapter.  I was not disappointed.  While it is not without flaw, it is an interesting, moving story written by an author who knows grammar, sentence structure, and who has a unique style.  The plot engages the reader almost immediately; and the reader is not wont to be disappointed with the subtle suspense that is carried forward to the end of the poignant tale. You're missing a real treat if you pass by this one.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Disney/Pixar has made another classic. They are an unstoppable force of brilliant movies. They've done the impossible and topped \\"Toy Story 2\\" with this one. This was the best movie of last year. I can't wait to own the DVD.
0316666343|5.0|This may be the best book I've read this year.  The author's approach is so very unusual.  Having the dead girl narrate gives a whole new meaning to &quot;third-person omniscient.&quot;  The book is riveting, touching, and I would recommend it to anyone.  People with young daughters will especially be moved by it.
B0000636UN|5.0|I have every other Sheryl Crow album, and I love all of them, The Globe Sessions being my favorite.  When I heard &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; on the radio, I was really surprised, I didn't think that it was her type of song, however I bought the album because I know my favorite songs on her previous albums are songs that never made it to radio (Home, Maybe Angels, Hard To Make A Stand-from &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot;, Riverwide, It Don't Hurt, Mississippi (my fav)from &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;)  So, needless to say &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; became my least favorite song on the album.  Every other song is great, with the exception of &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;  I have it in my CD player, I keep listening to it over and over.  I really recommend it to all Sheryl Crow fans.  My favorites on the album are &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;, &quot;Abilene&quot;, &quot;It's Only Love&quot;, &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot;, and I absolutely LOVE &quot;Diamond Road&quot;  But, really, the entire album is a pleasant listening experiece.
B000002H97|5.0|Before I say anymore, I have to tell you, I am 11 years old, and I love this album. I'm not like the other 99.9% of the kids in my age group who listen to nothing but cr**. Metallica is not my favorite band, but they ARE pretty high up there, easily ranking as the best metal group (with AC/DC close in second). The thing about the band Metallica that separates them from other metal bands, is their ability to continuously release awesome music. most bands started out awesome, and then began su**ing, badly. While this album is considerably different than their previous albums (which are all awesome, I might add), this is incredible. This is one of the few albums I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track (the other 2 being ZZ Top: Eliminator and Queensryche: Empire). Thre is only one thing I can compare Metallica's ability to reinvent themselves and never stop releasing good music, and that is the Beatles, who are another awesome band. Ok, enough about that, to the music!<br />1. Enter Sandman: 9.5/10. Like another reviewer said, an awesome way to kick off the album. Awesome guitar riffs make it understandable why this has become Matallica's signature song.<br />2. Sad But True: 9.0/10. Not as good as Enter Sandman, but amazing nonetheless. A perfect example of the lyrics that make it impossible to put Metallica in the same category with other groups.<br />3. Holier Than Thou: 7.75/10. The albums second worse song. The vocals and amazing guitar riffs make up for the songs repetitivness.<br />4. The Unforgiven: 9.75/10. One of the albums best tracks. Awesome lyrics and unbeatable insrumentals are marred only by the occasional sound of the electric guitar. Very slow and not very heavy may make this questionable to the fans of Metallica's older stuff, but I personally can't resist power ballads.<br />5. Wherever I May Roam: 9.75. Full force metal the puts it on par with The Unforgiven and beats out Enter Sandman. It's so good, you think about it even when your listening to other music.<br />6. Don't Tread On Me: 8.5/10. Extremely underrated. less than desirable lyrics are overcome by the chorus, which has a Les Miserables feel to it, if you ever listened to the musical.<br />7. Through the Never: 7.0/10. The albums worst. Really good anyway though. Really good instrumentals, but gets old fast and ALMOST makes you want to skip it.<br />8. Nothing Else Matters: 10/10. Like I said, I can't resist a power ballad. The albums best track isn't like Metallica's older work, but this song NEVER gets old, and has ver meaniful lyrics. I wish I wrote this song.<br />9. Of Wolf and Man: 9.0/10. The best werewolf song ever recorded. An exellent better song to put right after Nothing Else Matters.<br />10. The God That Failed: 9.0/10. Equal to Of Wolf and Man, this is the song the gets confused. It isn't sure whether it's full force metal or power ballad. That's good and bad.<br />11. My Friend of Misery: 9.5/10. Beter than the preceding song is somewhat hypnotic, and is another good example of awesome metal.<br />12. The Struggle Within: 8.0/10. Good, but doesn't leave an impact on your mind. I know this because I forget that this song is even on this album. But it's still good.<br />In conclusion, Metallic (the band) will never be conquered. It will always leave other music, be it bubbly, mainstream pop, hip-hop (which can't focus on anything other than pimping and violence), or the nu-metal crud the release today (all the bands the can upstage Metallica are, well, dead). The last good band was Nirvana, and Kurt Kobain commit suicide, so I guess I have<BR>to rely on Metallica to come up with new good music.
B000002UAO|5.0|So to start off, we've got a classic McCartney narrative popsong about a flirtation between a girl and the guy she wants to be her chauffeur. Sweet. Doesn't prepare you for what's to come, which is John's \\"Norwegian Wood\\", a folk song about smoking up with a strange girl and falling asleep in her tub. It's a song that's sick with regret and woozy with lost opportunities. And it's only the second track. This is where the future starts, for the Beatles and the rest of pop music.<br />The whole of this album is rife with Byrdsy metallic, folksy guitars and John trying his hardest to be Bob Dylan. See the smoky \\"Girl\\", the depressive, possibly sarcastic \\"Nowhere Man\\" and the heaven-sent \\"In My Life\\". \\"The Word\\" is insanely good hippie propaganda (\\"Have you heard?/The word is 'love'), and I'll take it anyday over \\"All You Need is Love\\". \\"Wait\\" is a rocking, overlooked gem of a song. \\"What Goes On\\" is pure country-rock, and features Ringo's least-irritating vocals ever. \\"If I Needed Someone\\" addresses that timeless problem we've all experienced of having to turn female admirers away at the door. \\"Michelle\\" ranks with McCartney's best.<br />And, of course, there's the irresistable \\"Run For Your Life\\", which John hated, but, really, living in the age of Eminem, I don't think there's any harm in loving this bitter, angry song. Actually, there's a bit of a missed opportunity here. The album could've been lent a semblance of conceptual unity if \\"Run For Your Life\\" had come earlier, followed by the revelation of \\"The Word\\". But clearly, that's just a small carp.<br />Other Beatles albums may be more packed with classics, more ambitious or more significant historically. None are as consistently perfect and charming. 'Rubber Soul' is filled with the music made by lads not only on the cusp of becoming the greatest musicians of the century, but also on the cusp of growing up. Small wonder Brian Wilson dug it so much.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Apparently this was just released two days ago. It's about time!  Until now, this album was only available in a first-generation remaster and, recently, in the 3-CD Complete In a Silent Way box set. Yes, you can now own the single-disc version without that annoying blue frame around the beautiful cover photo of Miles. <br />The sound quality of this remaster is amazing. The balance between the instruments is perfect, and each individual player's sound is crystal clear and recognizable. Tony Williams' cymbals are one of the most important aspects, and they are performed and recorded perfectly: just connected enough to create the ambient buzz, but still driving enough to make the listener become bodily involved (tapping your foot helps!). <br />This album is the true sequel to Kind of Blue, in that it shares the same mood and also a similar historical significance. A vanguard theory/style/approach, immediately pounced upon by Miles and presented in its pinnacle form, even though the movements of the two albums (modal improvisation and electric fusion, respectively) were brand new at the time. Somehow Miles was able to take these new and promising ideas and do them so well that it seems like the next decade would have the rest of the jazz world trying to catch up, while Miles just took them and ran further ahead. <br />This album, like KoB, is successful on every level of listening involvement. You can sit down by yourself and listen to every note, every layer of instrumentation and interaction, and it's all perfect. Or late at night with some friends during a session of either conversation or cannabinoid fumigatory imbibement, or just relaxation, put IaSW on in the background, and it will give you a stimulating yet calm soundscape.<BR>It's Oh So Quiet!

Star Trek The Motion Picture went from being the worst Star Trek movie to being one of the best. I think the reason why I like it better now is because I'm older and can understand it better.   Over the years there has been diffrent prints of this movie. The regular 132min. print that was shown in theaters in 1979/1980. The 143min. extended print that has been shown on T.V. and VHS. And now a new 136min. print with added special effects and certain parts of the film trimmed down to keep the movie going at a faster pace.   Director Rober Wise has done a good job tying up the loose ends in the film that he couldn't get finished in 1979 because of the studio's target release date for the movie. There's new shots of The Enterprise and new shots of V-GER that really help the movie out.   The DVD contains all kinds of Special Features. And the movie is better then ever. My only gripe is I wish they added the 143min print footage back into the film. The footage in that print gave the charcters more dialouge. But at least you get to see that footage in the deleated scences on the DVD. If your a fan of Star Trek this is a great DVD to put in your collection.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is one of the freshest, newest ideas I've seen in a long time. I got caught up in the music, the colors and the mysterious nature of the nightclub, the Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman was absolutely fantastic. She showed great range in this one movie: comedy, tragedy, love, seduction. <br />Wow! Fun!
B000002G7G|5.0|So... what do you do after you've just recorded the noisest, most volatile album in human history? Light some candles, ditch the artsy guy, have your fuzz boxes and distortion pedals stolen and make the most spiritual album of yours or anybody else's careers. Such is the case with the Velvet Underground's third album. Their quietest and most melodic affair, it doesn't make any compromises. It remains as weird and shifty and uncommercial as their previous outings. Just a lot quieter. <br />\\"Candy Says\\" is about as far away from \\"Sister Ray\\" as it's possible to get, a fragile song about a shy girl who hates her body and is naive in the ways of love and life. From there, we move on to the two most FUN songs ever: \\"What Goes On\\", where Doug Yule's organ-playing lifts Lou Reed's silly love-lorn lyrics and rhythm guitar up above the clouds, and the conversational \\"Some Kinda Love\\" which never fails to put a smile on my face because it juxtaposes Beatles-esque non-sequiturs like \\"put jelly on your shoulder baby/lie down upon the carpet\\" with nuggets of wisdom like \\"between thought and expression/there lies a lifetime\\".<br />Then we get \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\", a song so deeply affecting it's hard to listen to. Suffice it to say that few songwriters can say so much with so little as Reed does with \\"Thought of you as my mountaintop/Thought of you as my peak/Thought of you as everything/I had but couldn't keep\\". The infidelity and regret in that song carries over into the prayer of \\"Jesus\\", a single verse followed my several minutes of false endings. This song especially came as a surprise to fans in 1969, but bear in mind the spirituality of songs like \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Heroin\\" when listening to this one. Appropriately enough, \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" follows, a life-affirming rock song tossed off by a man who would now be able to write \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\". It's easy to forget \\"I'm Set Free\\" and \\"That's the Story of My Life\\" neither of which are as outstandingas much of the rest of the album, but must be heard nevertheless.<br />\\"The Murder Mystery\\" really is sort of pointless, except as a palate-cleanser for what follows. It's cool, it's weird, but unlike the rest of the cool, weird things this band did, you won't want to listen to it a million times to sort it all out. <br />Then \\"Afterhours\\" just comes out of nowhere. Whether you think it's about loneliness, alcoholism or suicide (or all three) is really irrelevant. Once Lou Reed's said all he needs to say over the course of the last three albums about sex, drugs and redemption, he turns the mike over to the sweet, sweet, sweet voiced drummer Maureen Tucker, whose distinctive pounding was the pulse of the band for the last three albums. This heaven-sent ditty sung by a shy girl who is out-of-touch with the fun things in life (\\"...\\") ties back to the first song, which wraps the album up in a nice package. <br />An graceful album if ever there was one, VU III is a happy ending, with just the right amount of melancholia to give it weight. The last true Velvets album, and rightfully regarded as a masterpiece.
B00003CXB7|5.0|When most people think of \\"M*A*S*H\\", they often think of the 1970's television sitcom that ran for 11-years on CBS and continues to be aired in syndication to this day.  The series acquired and continues to maintain millions of fans, but many of the fans have never seen the original film that inspired the series.  The original film is much darker than the series.<br />From the 1960's atmosphere of cultural revolution, civil rights, the Cold War and anti-war sentiment exacerbated by the carnage of the Vietnam War, the director Robert Altman created a brilliant and realistic vision of the human tragedy of war in his film \\"M*A*S*H\\", but in a very humorous way.  Unlike its war film predecessors, \\"M*A*S*H\\" does not glorify generals, battles, or politicians.  Instead, \\"M*A*S*H\\" portrays the lives of doctors and nurses at Mobile Army Surigcal Hospital 4077 attempting to maintain their sanity while struggling to save the lives of the young soldiers fighting and dying in the Korean War.<br />\\"M*A*S*H\\" opens with the well-known theme song, but it includes lyrics that may take many by surprise: \\"suicide is painless, it brings on many changes\\".  We then see the initial arrival of Captain Benjamin Franklin \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce (portrayed by Donald Sutherland) in Korea at a military airbase that is very dirty, muddy and gray.  When he arrives at MASH 4077, we see a very hairy Captain Francis Xavier \\"Trapper John\\" McIntyre (portrayed by Elliot Gould) sitting in the mess tent.  Hawkeye and Trapper John find their irreverance for the military and authority in common and become close friends as time passes, and that friendship is also shared with Captain Augustus Bedford \\"Duke\\" Forrest (portrayed by Tom Skerritt).  Duke was the only major film character that was not included in the TV series.<br />Two majors at MASH 4077 don't share the irreverance for authority that Hawkeye, Trapper & Duke have: Major Frank Burns (portrayed by Robert Duvall) who is often seen reading from the bible, andmilitary-career-minded Major Margaret \\"Hot Lips\\" O'Houlihan (portrayed by Sally Kellerman).  On the surface, each of the majors is quite dedicated to their belief in the military, but the reality is that each is quite hypocritical.  They give in to their passions one night (Frank is married), but it does not go unnoticed; and Margaret earns her knickname of \\"Hot Lips\\".<br />In command of this motley group is the inept Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake (portrayed by Roger Bowen), who is assisted by the faithful company clerk Corporal Walter \\"Radar\\" O'Reilly (portrayed by Gary Burghoff--the only film cast member to play the same role in the long-running TV series).<br />The brilliant collage of scenes, including the bloody operating room scenes, and the stark cinematography create a powerful message from the mind of Robert Altman--war is a mixture of death, physical suffering and emotional torment, not all glory and honor.<br />If you're a long time fan of the television series and have never seen the original film, there is a good chance that you won't like the film; but if you're a serious cinema aficionado, \\"M*A*S*H\\" should be in your collection because it is probably one of the best films of all time.<br />The rendering of the film on DVD is very well done and the commentaries and documentaries on the second DVD are a great bonus.  I highly recommend this 2-DVD set.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I know I know we all love to say how much we hate Britney or how untalented she is, but let's face it...deep down we all know she's sexy, cool, and can dance like nobody's business...and maybe she doesn't have the stongest or best voice but I know I'd be lying if I said I'd never got one of her catchy tunes stuck in my head...I have to say sometimes I'm not that fond of her and I'm not going to go buy her cd, but I surely will go download some of those songs to listen to when nobody's around.
B000002UAR|5.0|Since this has been officially selected as the best album of all time by just about every publication ever, I'm going to limit myself to some point-form thoughts about the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\". <br />- The first four songs have to the darkest sequence of songs on any Beatles album ever, don't you think? Taxes and death. Loneliness and death. Lethargy as a deathlike dreamstate. Love and death and the tabla. Like, whoa, man. <br />- \\"She Said She Said\\", a trippy tune that threatens to give acid rock a good name, and \\"For No One\\", a ballad that is understated where \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is bombastic, are two of the most underrated Beatles songs. The horn that appears two-thirds of the way through the latter song exactly captures what it sounds like to wake up with a broken heart. <br />- Listen to the motown swagger of \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" and then listen to \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". It's incredible the difference a couple of years make, isn't it? <br />- Ever notice that two of George's contributions, \\"Love You To\\" and \\"I Want To Tell You\\" are diametrically opposed? One goes \\"Love me while you can/Before I'm a dead old man\\" and the other \\"I don't mind/I can wait forever/I've got time\\"! God, that's clever!<br />- \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" still scares me.<br />- Despite all those nice things, there's some songs I really don't care for that come along at critical junctures in the album. \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is the kind of sappy thing I'd expect from solo Paul, but not the Paul who just gave the world \\"Paperback Writer\\". \\"Yellow Submarine\\" works in no context outside of the movie. \\"Doctor Robert\\" may be about a drug dealer, but I don't care, it still comes off as too feathery-light to be a good rocker. I realize these are all strictly personal quibbles and they won't bother 99% of the people listening to 'Revolver'. Terrific. Still, these things prevent me from holding this album as dear to my heart as, say, the flawless 'Rubber Soul' and the flawed-but-immenseWhite Album. <br />- Ignore my petty complaints and just go buy this album, if you don't own it already. NOW. GO.
B000002GYG|5.0|Featuring a solid band, cool hooks, fantastic beat poetry, and the smokiest, gravelliest voice on record, this is probably Waits' finest work.  Although not recorded \\"live\\" in the traditional sense, the presence of the studio audience generates plenty of ambience and gives Waits somebody to relate to - his spoken word introductions to most of the songs help draw us into his world, get us past his gruff exterior, and present us with that crucial everyman persona.  Working on the darker side of the cocktail jazz strip, the ensemble is also one of the best Waits has ever had.  The presence of pianist Mike Melvoin gives the band a strength and solidity that is sometimes lacking in Waits' own keyboard playing, and Pete Christlieb on tenor sax adds plenty of urban sensual warmth.  Special mention goes to Jim Hughart's upright bass, which is appropriately striding during the \\"beat\\" numbers (the pun-filled \\"Emotional Weather Report\\" and \\"Spare Parts 1\\" in particular), and mournful during the booze ballads, even using the bow during the warmly nostalgic (almost Garrison Keillor-esque) \\"Putnam County\\".  But of course the real standout is Waits and the provocative beat poetry that makes him the Charles Bukowski of modern music.  Waits has an intense sound with a voice that immediately identifies him as an outsider - rough, gritty, not-quite-broken, but almost \\"more than a good man could bear\\".  His natural milieu is the barroom wherever it can be found - urban nightclubs to rural roadhouses and any establishment in between where a man who's down on his luck can find a few hours of forgetfulness - but he can also sometimes be located in all-night diners, abandoned roads, and late-night cheap hotels.  It isn't pretty, and it can get pretty darn depressing at times (\\"Warm Beer and Cold Women\\"), but for those who've been there - who've known the desperation that foments it - this is a celebration of the life that doesn't always seem to be worth living.  Songs like \\"Eggs and Sausage\\", \\"Better off Without a Wife\\" and \\"Nighthawk Postcards\\" demonstrate that there is as much poetry and emotional depth in a life of dissolution as in any other.  Cheers.e\\", \\"Better off Without a Wife\\" and \\"Nighthawk Postcards\\" demonstrate that there is as much poetry and emotional depth in a life of dissolution as in any other.  Cheers.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This album is extremely high concept, we get to find out about Britney Spears... (the person), but that doesnt always mean that the album itself is that good. While it does show a maturation of britney as an artist, most of the time, the songs are actually kind of boring. This albume one stand out, I'm a slave 4 U, only because The Neptunes did a good job in making an INTERESTINGLY sounding song, and while britney may lack the vocal merit, the dressed up beats that the neptunes bring to this song make it more then listenable. The other producers also deliver catchy songs. Plus britney chipped in a bit in the writing department, with credits for co-writing a little over half the album, thats got to be worth something, right?
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think it's one of my favorite cd's ever..i can't stop listening to it..it has all the songs that u can dance to..and sing along with. I love it!
B00005QDW1|5.0|I just bought this cd August 20th, 2002. I was so excited because I loved the songs &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Hella Good&quot;, and &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, I first listened to all the tracks and I didn't think it was really good. I was wrong. I bought it and was so happy that it was like the best No Doubt album out so far as well as Tragic Kingdom which I need to pick up. You got to pick up this cd like all the songs rock. I also love 9: Running, 8: Start The Fire, 10: In My Head as well as many others just check it out it's the best!
B000002GBK|2.0|Six Wives is so much better than this one.<BR>I bought this one and Yes's Fragile at the same time. No comparison. Fragile is much more mature, elaborate, complicated, masterpiece.<BR>At some point I was so annoyed by the keyboard sound that I turned of the cd. As I am writting this review I am listening to the 6th Track \\"Sir Galahad\\", and its really really bad. If I could have my money back I would return it in an instance.
B00005QZWI|5.0|When I first saw Peter Jackson's film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; in theaters in 2001, I thought that one of this magnificent epic's best features was the superb musical score by Howard Shore. I now happily report that the work of Shore and his collaborators is more than just an integral component to the great film; the soundtrack stands on its own as an compelling work of art apart from the film.<br />The work of Shore, the musicians, and solo vocalists is richly diverse and full of emotion. Haunting, playful, ominous, eerie, joyful, gentle: all these moods and more are captured by this great music. Here are a few notable highlights:<br />&quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; (track #2): has a sweet, fun, Celtic-flavored sound. &quot;At the Sign of the Prancing Pony&quot; (#6): Features some frightening choral work in the tradition of Jerry Goldsmith's score for &quot;The Omen.&quot; &quot;Many Meetings&quot; (#9): Probably the most magical piece on the whole disc; its ethereal sound well captures the world of Tolkien's elves. &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; (#10): Features a hauntingly beautiful vocal performance by Enya. &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot; (#11): Features a magnificent, thundering version of the main heroic theme. &quot;Lothlorien&quot; (#14): features an unearthly vocal performance by Elizabeth Fraser. &quot;The Great River&quot; (#15): choral voices effectively enhance the mystical sound of this piece. &quot;Amon Hen&quot; (#16): driving martial percussion captures the terrifying nature of the Uruk-Hai. &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; (#17): features another great vocal, this time by Edward Ross.<br />This CD captures the happiness, the adventure, the horror, and the tender friendship that make J.R.R. Tolkien's great epic such an enduring story. My congratulations to Jackson, Shore, and all involved in the film and its outstanding score.
B000069I1H|2.0|I'm giving this movie two stars because I did enjoy this movie, but not so much as to pay for a rental...It's kinda like Turner and Hooch...a good movie when its on TBS, but who would buy it.<br />The premise for this movie is that De Niro plays a tough cop that gets himself into a situation with the news media, and to get out of it....he has to star in a new reality tv show about cops...kinda like cops but always with the same cops.  Murphy plays an actor who is a cop (his day job), that really doesn't seem to care about much except stardom.  I just can't believe that De Niro would get involved with a film of this nature...it doen't make sense to me....lets put it this way....if De Niro wasn't in this movie, I wouldn't and I don't think many other people would be so hard on it.  De Niro....man....what were you thinking.<br />If you want to watch a movie about reality tv, watch Edtv because that is atleast pretty darn funny...all the humor this movie has are one-liners about previous De Niro characters.<br />Wait for it on TBS...then you won't be dissappointed.
B000002UW1|4.0|This album, whilst far from catapulting them into mega-stardom, gave REM their first big hits. The first is 'The One I Love': this is a classic love song which is quite painful and hurt inside. The other is the polar opposite 'It's The End of the World As We Know It'. This too is a classic, but in a fun, jump-about kind of way. Stipe sings at 100 mph, and this was the first pop song I ever liked.<br />Also worthy of mention is the strong opener 'Finest Worksong', which is pleasingly political and a strong lyric, and 'Oddfellows Local 151', one of the rockiest tracks on the album, though there was nothing to match its predecessor's opener 'Begin The Begin' as a perfect rock song, complete with top riffs and all. Generally this album is not quite as brilliant as several REM other albums, including Life's Rich Pageant, but contains some great songs and is worth owning all the same.
B000069CWE|4.0|As most linkin park fans have heard the news/rumors of this album. It's not really a remix, it's more of a touch up of the songs with different lyrics and beats. It has a little bit more rock into it rather than hip-hop. I thought this cd would be just a complete remix of all of the songs, but when I heard the different lyrics and noticed aaron lewis from staind jump into the krwlng track I was like whoah! My favorite song on the album is P5hng Me Aw*y. You can really feel the emotion and anger in that song and it is way better than the original \\"Pushing Me Away\\" track. I think this song would top the modern rock charts on the billboard top 20. If your a linkin park fan, I recommend this album!
B0000004V2|5.0|In 1989, the Stone Roses paved the way for countless Britpop, Madchester, dance-rock and indie-rock bands with this one, universally appealing, classic debut. They never came anyone near bettering it and that's no surprise seeing some of the brilliant tracks here.<br />Opener 'I Wanna Be Adored' is a magnificent fusion of a pounding, driving rhythm section, an almost oriental guitar line and Ian Brown's melodic, sustained voice. Throughout the CD all the other classics are visited - 'She Bangs The Drums' - pure euphoria in a fantastic pop song, a classic melody with meandering bass - 'Waterfall' - a Manchester anthem for decades to come - 'Made of Stone' - my very favourite - a psychadelic, swirling rock song with an unmistakable riff, a mysterious, beckoning verse and a classic tune in the chorus, and winding up at the 11-minute brilliant work that is 'I Am The Resurrection' - a pretty cool tune, but after 4 minutes it flows into a mad, hynotic, genius instrumental section - and that is what is most exciting.<br />The Stone Roses never did anything else half this good (except for maybe the single Fools Gold). But I'm happy with this as proof that they were one of the most influential, important bands ever and this CD is one of the true classics.
0385335482|5.0|This is by far the best book i have ever read. It is very funny, and fun to read. The situations the main charecter Rebecca Bloomwood gets herself into make you sometimes question her level of sanity. The only thing that gets slightly annoying, is the lack of common sence Rebecca has. Other then that, it is a wounderful book. The sequal is even better.
B0000028VT|5.0|if you like Mariah or not, this album is fantastic.  from song to song, the best quality album she ever released, the voice is increadibly, full power!
B000002AVF|5.0|Hey,<br />Daydream is my favorite Mariah cd! I really like Butterfly too, but Daydream is what made me a Mariah fan. The one song that I  LOVE off this cd is Looking In, Mariah has a real talent for writing haunting&amp; beautiful songs- like Outside, Twister, Looking In and there's more!. Fantasy is probably my fave of all her uptempo songs! The rest of the cd is really good with hightlights such as Always Be My Baby, Fantasy, Looking In, When I Saw You, One Sweet Day but the rest are good! Like many I own all her cd's and I'll continue to buy them.. because Mariah is So talented at writing her songs and of course singing!
1577311523|5.0|This book won't change your life, but you may experience your life in a wholly different way after reading it.  I've read a lot of Buddhist-leaning self-help books.  Many of them were quite inspirational, but none were as cogently written and humbly wise as this book.  The book contains no lists or recipes for self-help.  It just lays out the basic truths of our existence while acknowleging that reading and thinking about them is not a substitute for experiencing and being in the moment.  Reading this book is like the whack across the backside.  It will wake you up.  The rest is up to you.
B000000OQF|5.0|While it's all been said before, here's me two cents. This is a flat out incredible album -- one of the best, if not quite possibly the best, rock-n-roll records of the '80s. It's all here form the radio staples &quot;Sweet Chid,&quot; &quot;Paradise City&quot; to the dark &quot;My Michelle&quot; and &quot;Rocket Queen.&quot;
B0000004V2|5.0|I made a tape recording of this album about 10 years ago. But, I never really got into the Stone Roses' music until recently after reading about them in several books about Rave music. Now, the more I listen to the album the better it gets. <br />It is worthy to note that I was into the UK Rave scene in the early nineties and not much of a fan of rock music. At that time, I did not really understand what the Stone Roses were doing musically. Since then, my musical tastes have become more diverse.<br />What I find most appealing about this album is its rhythmic complexity. I wish all rock music had the syncopated rhythms of tracks like Elephant Stone and Fools Gold.<br />If you haven't heard it, give it a try. If you like it, spread the word.
B00004YZFQ|3.0|This film has its importance: it seems to foreshadow the end of the \\"Summer of Love\\" 1960s, and point to something darker and less communal.  Drugs seem eery and frightening here, a bad trip, instead of as keys to open doors of perception.  It's telling that the disaster at Altamont happened to the 'Stones, because their aimlessness and lack of political feeling are on display here.  <br />The 'Stones come across as stoned and shallow, people who just want to party and have sex.  Their audience seems similarly apolitical and in search of only a good time.  While an imperialist war rages in Vietnam, and while a social revolution continues in the US and Britain, the Stones were interested only in themselves.  Their apathy has its mirror in the Altamont nightmare. <br />The film, though, is slow-going.  It doesn't rock or excite, and it doesn't probe the characters involved.  You long for more interviews, more context, and a faster pace, but instead you are slowly led into a deep, dark \\"bummer,\\" as one manager puts it.
0887309372|5.0|The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding was primarily written by Laura Ries - Al Ries was a co-author on the book - in case anyone didn't know.  Such information is available at their website.  I rank this book a solid 5 star book because the insights / examples provided far outweigh any concerns / problems I found with the book.  This book caused me to look at advertising / marketing from a different perspective in my daily life which is what I use to evaluate if something is a 5 star book<br />I loved The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding for the following reasons:<br />1. It flat out states the importance of marketing & branding, which is important to separate in the readers' mind before beginning.  As they state \\"Marketing is building a brand in the mind of the prospect. If you can build a powerful brand you will have a powerful marketing program. If you can't, then all the advertising, fancy packaging, sales promotion and public relations in the world won't help you achieve your objective.\\"<br />2. The Ries' call it like they see it.  Excellent examples of marketing / advertising stupidity / effectiveness are provided.<br />3. They talk about the plethora of products that are produced each year.<br />4. They discuss how businesses must get inside a consumer's mind (AKA positioning) to win the war.  Volvo = safety, BMW = Ultimate Driving Machine, Mercedes = prestige, Toyota = Reliability, Ford = ?, Chevy = ?.  The Ries' clearly spell out an excellent reason as to why the U.S. automanufacturers are getting killed.<br />5. The book illustrates, as did the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, how companies dilute their brands through line extensions (I personally believe this due to my personal experience / buying patterns and observations of others.)<br />6. They point out the increasing importance of PR (public relations) compared to advertising.  This is the subject of a new book by the father / daughter.  Basically PR launches a product and advertising gives it life support is their main assertion.<br />I disliked The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding for the following reasons:<br />1. Overlap from prior books is definitely occurring.  I have noticed this with Jack Trout's recent books too. I would estimate that 15% - 20%, at a minimum, of Trout's recent books and this book have been stated in one form or another in their prior works.<br /><br />2. Some of the examples provide clearly refute other examples provided.  On page 100 they state \\"the Mustang and former CEO of Chrysler Corporation (two powerful brand names.)  In prior examples the authors clearly state that the brand is the maker of the company.  Volvo = safety, BMW = driving machine, etc (you will find such features in all their vehicles -maybe not in Volvos convertible.)  What does Chrysler stand for again?  Minivans?  I haven't exactly noticed it in their advertising......for a long time...<br />Conclusion:  Buy the book.  It is well worth the time and money.  Most of my reviews are in business / economics and I encourage people to read them, whether here on Amazon or at my personal website. If you are interested in another good marketing book I highly recommend Differentiate or Die by Jack Trout or Seth Godin's book on permission marketing / launching an ideavirus.  If you are interested in other subjects I would encourage you to read The Worldly Philosophers by Robert Heilbroner if you are interested in economic history - the book is international in scope and deals with the lives and times of the most famous economists in history. If you are interested in economic development / evolution of U.S. property history I would encourage you to read Hernando DeSoto's Mystery of Capital but note his lack of focus on corruption in certain countries.

B000068TSI|5.0|What Saving Pvt Ryan did for &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; We were soldier does for my generation. I HAD to see Pvt Ryan the first day it hit the big screen, I wanted to. When the movie was over I had to sit and collect myself. (A lady that was sitting in front of me patted my shoulder when she left) I was to go home that night and write a review for The Strawberry Fields Daily Movement, I couldn't, I had to wait till the next day. This is such a powerful telling of the early days of Vienam. How true men of valor could and DID act under pressure. As I wrote for the SFDM, &quot;gone are the days of the old John Wayne movies where a soldier clutches his chest and falls over nice and clean. If you are the least bit sqeemish about seeing the effects of steel invading the human body think twice about seeing this movie.&quot;<BR>If this movie doesn't collect several awards I want the academy investigated!
B00005JKZT|5.0|Okay, I am basically a Tolkien geek, but I still keep my cool... I have read the whole trilogy twice and almost done with the first two books for the third time. I know quite a bit about what the movie will be like basing it on the book. Jackson stayed basically to the book when making the Fellowship of the Ring, so he should for The Two Towers. Yes, there are some things that he had to take out of FOTR such as Bombadil and Gildor and the Exiles, but did he have a choice? Watching the special features on the FOTR DVD, I noticed that Jackson said that everyone always had said that these amazing classics could never be made into a movie. The world of Middle Earth was too large. Well, here Jackson is, an avid Tolkien fan, and he is determined to find a way. Everyone was right... there is no possible way to fit EVERYTHING into ONE movie... so Jackson fit what he could into THREE movies. The Two Towers is massive compared to FOTR, and the movie will be the same. There is more action for war-buffs, more romance for people like me, more mystery fo those who like suspense. This is a movie telling of the journey, rather than one that draws a picture of the characters which was the purpose of FOTR. Here you meet important people, such as omer and owyn and Thoden. In the second half, you meet Faramir & Smagol/Gollum. How can you add that many more MAIN charactors and NOT have a HUGE movie? Compared to The Two Towers, the FOTR was slow and boring. This will be a movie to remember, with one amazing battle scene, an amazing hunt, wonderful new creatures, new characters, and a whole lot of class. I thought i would mention to ravenya that most of the book is about Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli and Merry & Pippen. Frodo and Sam don't come in until the second half of the book, which makes for an interesting question of how will Jackson do the seperate books? Will he and do every other scene, or every two scenes (by scenes i mean like chapters of the book) or will he actually have just two halves, and the end of the first half is an ending of the movie? Just a thought to ponder. Here's a sum of all this babble :-) The Two Towers will be a massive movie, both in scale, and in the box office. It is a movie that has something for everyone, from action to romance to mystery. This will be a must see when it comes out.
B0000640VO|5.0|What can I say? The movie speaks for itself. You are depriving yourself of a wonderful experience if you don't watch this movie.
6305922756|5.0|Many good things have been written below about the movie and the soundtrack, and I agree with all of them.  My wife bought me the CD after we both loved the movie and I listen to it all the time.  It is one of those things that gets better every time you listen to it.  The band is made up of very clever comics with the ability to mock various music genres.  One of my best buys!
B000000WJZ|4.0|The Pumpkins come out of the eclectic Chicago scene of the early nineties, mixing classic and modern music in equal measure, though they come across more as a classic rock update than as leaders of a new sound. Mixing pyschedelia, metal and prog with the introspective lyrics of shoegazing bands like My Bloody Valentine, it's easy to see that the band comes from the same scene as say, Certain Distant Suns. This album is the one that really established the band as kings of the hard alt rock scene, which was soon to replace grunge as the hip hard rock of the nineties. Heavy radio play and MTV attention made songs like `Today' and `Disarm' as familiar as anything off NEVERMIND, and the band was on it's way. Corgan has an appealing wail, and there is much to admire here, especially for fans of metal bands like Black Sabbath or hard Goth bands like Siouxsie and The Banshees and The Jesus And Mary Chain. Although not as interesting as they were important (and they were very important), people who are fans of the genre will not be disappointed; even those with a passing interest in shoegazing and metal of the nineties should take note.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was without a doubt the best film or series I have ever seen, regardless of subject.  I was riveted to every episode, and watched it everytime it came on HBO(same episode often repeated 2-3 times per week).  I finally recorded it (am missing parts IV and V... really missing!) As a female I often wonder if I am odd that this series touched me so profoundly.  It really brought home to me how much our military personnel sacrifice as they serve our country (past and present).  I will never look at Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, VE or VJ Days the same.  An amazing piece of work.
B00005OAIE|5.0|why listen to rickey? john's songs are obviously more for girls then guys. Room for squares is the best cd ive ever listened to! I dont usually listen to this type but now its almost the only music i listen to.
B00000IL1K|5.0|It's difficult to describe such a diverse and lovely album. Unlike other artists, she doesn't sing as though her life depended on it; she sings as though she were making new life.<br />Opera purists will, no doubt, consider this pop, and pop purists will, no doubt, consider this opera. Though I'm not a devotee of either, I love the way Sarah Brightman sings all these styles--and more. Songs like &quot;In Paradisium&quot; and the inspirational (and, at times, wonderfully depressing) &quot;Deliver Me&quot; ring of New Age. Sometimes, the crossover blends in a single track, like the magnificent &quot;Anytime, Anywhere.&quot; Songs like &quot;Bailero&quot; are soothing while &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;, a powerhouse opera song written for a tenor, rings powerfully. Sarah's songs also strike the romantic chord within us, like the melancholy &quot;Last Words You Said&quot; and the heart-tugging &quot;Only an Ocean Away.&quot;<br />In short: stunning.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|If there ever was an album that defined old-school metal, it's \\"Van Halen.\\"  It's tracks include such great hits as \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love,\\" \\"Runnin' with the Devil,\\" \\"Eruption,\\" and \\"Jamie's Cryin'.\\"  The guitar tone is unmatchable.  Eddie actually put less wattage into his 100watt Marshall stack, plugged in a 1971 Fender Stratocaster, and spit out the greatest sound ever to rock this Earth.  The drumming by Alex Van Halen is catchy and amazing.  Michael Anthony, although not showboated by his band, certainly lives up to the challenge.  Then you throw in David Lee Roth screaming like a banshee with a three day ..., and you have the greatest rock/metal album in the history of music.  Released in 1978 by Warner Brothers Records, the songs are as follows.<BR>1.Runnin' With The Devil: Great tone, catchy beat.<BR>2.Eruption: If you haven't heard this think, \\"Rock.\\"<BR>3.You Really Got Me: Greatest cover I've ever heard.<BR>4.Ain't Talkin' Bout Love:  Eddie's greatest rythym song.<BR>5.I'm The One: INCREDIBLY FAST improv by the guitar slinger.<BR>6.Jamie's Cryin': Alex and DLR shine on this heartbreak jam.<BR>7.Atomic Punk: The only skip-over track.  Dissapointing.<BR>8.Feel Your Love Tonight: Awesome opening riff.  Great bass.<BR>9.Little Dreamer: Shredding meets Hendrix, a real trip.<BR>10.Ice Cream Man: Van Halen writes a great blues bar jam, my fav!<BR>11.On Fire: A definitive rock song.  Great drums, bass, guitar.<br />Go out and buy this album.  It shines in every way possible.  This broke all sorts of rock barriers.  Van Halen got into the spotlight with this, their first full-length album, and sold 10.4 million copies of it.  This is a cd no true metal fan should be without.
B00005K3LW|4.0|I never saw this movie when it first came out because I didn't like the 2nd one very much.  I watched this for the first time in May 2002 and thought it was much better than the second.  Both Willis and Jackson do a very good job.
0060922583|5.0|Clearly reveals one of the secrets of the universe.  If you're interested in that kinda thing ...
B000067CPX|5.0|I see to many people comparing \\"By The Way\\" to BSSM.  The two are a whole decade apart.  That means that the Peppers are a whole ten years older, have experienced ten more years,and maybe have found some different influences.  Sure for 1991-1992 BSSM was great.  It gave a slap to the face of all the pop and hair metal, just like other great bands of the time.  If you expected guys in their mid to late 30's still making songs like \\"Suck My Kiss\\" or \\"Sir Psycho Sex\\", then you are fooling yourself.  Anyways back to the best album of 2002.  Every song on this album fells like it should be on here.  \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" are reminders of what it is like to be in your twenties, while the rest of the album fells and sounds like mature adults making great music.  This album is just more  then 16 songs, this album is a work of art.
B00004R9A4|5.0|BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is one of Disney's most beloved live-action musical masterpieces.  It has received a full restoration for its 30th Anniversary edition, which marks the film's long-awaited DVD debut.<br />Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) unwittingly takes in three young orphans when the bombs of Hitler begin to fall on the city of London.  Being an apprentice witch, privacy is important to Ms Price, but soon their help becomes useful when she has to journey to London in search of one Professor Browne (David Tomlinson - MARY POPPINS).  Joining forces, they decide to track down a mysterious magical spell which they hope will bring an end to the war.<br />The Sherman brothers' sparkling tunes include the Oscar-nominated \\"Age of Not Believing\\", \\"Portobello Road\\", \\"Beautiful Briny\\" and \\"Flourish and a Flair\\".<br />In a situation which is not unlike the fates of THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE and THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE (both also written by the Sherman brothers), BEDKNOBS was trimmed from its 134-minute running time to the lesser length of 117 minutes; which meant the deletion of several songs and some important scenes, crucial to the plot.  They have been thankfully restored into this new release, which has a dynamic 5.1 sound mix and a crystal-clear picture.<br />The DVD also includes animated shorts, deleted song - \\"A Step in the Right Direction\\", picture/poster/still gallery and an interview with the Sherman brothers.
6302424887|4.0|Roman Polanski's MacBeth is a particularly bloody rendition of the play - the battle and murder scenes are a bit of a shock if you're used to, say, Orson Welles' version, or the old BBC one with Nicol Williamson.  John Finch plays a fine, strapping MacBeth - his performance is as good as his Henry IV done for the BBC a few years back.  He and Lady MacBeth are young and beautiful, one of the first times they were portrayed this way, to make a contrast with their bloody deeds.  The fine, weird score and the often rainy, muddy scenes add much to this production, which might not be for everyone but is certainly decent enough to watch in order to have another version on hand with which to savour the poetry.  Polanski made this film soon after his wife, Sharon Tate, was killed by the Manson gang; it is thought (how could it be thought otherwise?) that he put his upset into the \\"look\\" of this film.
B000002MUW|2.0|Madonna could have been on top of her game in 1994. She should have swallowed her pride and opened her heart with Pat Leonard's help. Instead, this album sounds like trail mix tastes. A bunch of over-rated producers who were hip at the time(a real joke in retrospect!)were hired in a desperate attempt by record company execs to rescue Madge from the abyss that followed Erotica, Sex and Body of Evidence. Madonna's self-cofidence was shaken, but her vulnerability is polished and streamlined into weak,over-produced nonsense. Inside of Me is worth a listen, although it sounds similar to a couple of other ballads she has made over the years. Secret is the only real standout track, unless you thought Take A Bow was a great song! This is definitely only worth exploring after you have bought her other albums.  Buy GHV2 if you just want the hits. Even Madge doesn't like this one.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Why do people call Britney Spears an artist. She doesnt write her own music, and she sings poorly the lyrics others have writen for her. She's going on her looks, and as wise people know, looks will not last. Every thing must eventually wither and grow old, become less attractive, and die. Therefore, you should focus on the permanent:human creativity. Listen to Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Dr. Dre,Mozart, Brahms, Beethoven. Thats good music.
0380789035|4.0|I'm new to Neil Gaiman, having only read \\"Good Omens\\" before, about four years ago. With \\"American Gods\\" I might become inspired to truly dive into this author's rich body of work. This book has a very creative treatise. Old pagan gods still live on as destitute characters in the real world, as long as a few isolated pockets of people still venerate them. Meanwhile, really old gods that are completely forgotten by humanity have disappeared into oblivion. The major religions couldn't even obliterate these decrepit old pagan gods for good, but the real gods of modern America may finally do it - the harsh gods of money and technology. The straight man in the novel is a hapless ex-con named Shadow, who eventually realizes that the bizarre characters he keeps running into are those decaying pagan gods who need his help in their struggle. Shadow also eventually bumbles into the realization that these gods are allying themselves with him for a greater purpose. The concepts behind this book are indeed fascinating and highly creative. Unfortunately the book must be docked one star because the action peters out towards the end, and the anti-climax takes way too long wrapping up a bunch of boring subplots. But still, Neil Gaiman is clearly one of the modern masters of innovative, speculative fiction.
B000002I25|1.0|The doors were a sub-par blues/rock band. End of story. 1967 saw the release of many truly great albums: the Beatles- Sgt. Pepper, Jimi Hendrix-Are You Experienced, and Pink Floyd-The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Unfortunatly, Jim Morrison has fooled millions into thinking that he was somehow &quot;dark&quot;. People think they're listening to something cool when they hear the doors because, ooooh, they were the &quot;dark side&quot; to the 60's peace and love thing. Aaaahh, they could see beyond what your AVERAGE hipster could, and probed into the more intricate depths of the mind. Such is the mentality of your typical doors fan. They think they are a cut above the rest and get something that others dont. The only problem is that the door's music is so increadibly one dimensional, so inept, so simple, so.....bland. None of the members of the band were great musicians.......good god, listen to Hendrix, the guitar guru, he blows the doors away. The only reason doors fans think the music is deep is because Jim Morrison tells listeners he is deep through his seeminly deep lyrics.....his lyrics are actually rather boring and self indulgent. Other bands don't force feed you their message, they let you feel it, figure it out for yourself.
B000066F6H|2.0|The title of this review is from the chorus of the song \\"Statecontrol\\" on this disc. That sentiment may be the way the Hives see the making of music and the art of being rockstars. Don't believe the hype swarming around this album. Clearly in this post-grunge wasteland, the rock press is so starved for new heroes that mediocre bands are being crowned the Next Big Thing on little merit. Last year it was the Strokes, who are actually a competent band and have the potential to really do something important in the future. Now it's the Hives, who like the Strokes try to get by on sheer rockstar attitude to cover up a shortage of original ideas. But forget about the Hives. This album is a measly 28 minutes of recycled punk minimalism - at this length they should sell it for half price. There is barely an original thought in this band's head as they crank out stale riffs stolen from the Stones, Ramones, and Stooges. Singer Pelle Almqvist, who calls himself \\"Howlin\\" but is actually more of a whiner, is in a real identity crisis, unable to decide if he's Mick Jagger or Johnny Rotten. This album's one attempt to rise above the predictable, \\"Find Another Girl\\" (an old soul remake) is a hideous clone of bad 60's pop that might as well be a Rolling Stones outtake from 1967, recorded when the Glimmer Twins were at their drunkest. If you've heard the hit single \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\" then that's all you need to know about this disc. When I saw the Hives on a TV appearance, Almqvist blurted to the crowd \\"America loves the Hives! We are your new favorite band!\\" Ironic humor or desperation? All this band has is attitude, and that won't carry the day.<br />By the way, if America is fascinated by Swedish roots rockers, there is an infinitely better Swedish band with real talent, vision, and ambition. They're called the Hellacopters. Run don't walk towards them and away from the Hives.
B00003CX9W|1.0|The quality and presentation of this restored version of FANTASIA is wonderful. Finally restored, unseen since the initial release, are the complete introductory sequences, including a chimes player's accident with his instrument, the orchestra applauding Mickey Mouse, and the orchestra shuffling out for the intermission. Even the original title card has been returned to its proper place, during the intermission. (Some of the narration was rerecorded due to original voice tracks being no longer available.)<br /><br />But there is CONSIDERABLE CONTROVERSY over the continued censorship of the \\"Pastorale\\" sequence. Circa 1969, the seemingly racist shots of a black centaurette (similar to Our Gang's \\"Buckwheat\\") attending on the white centaurettes were cut from the film, resulting in a \\"jump\\" in the music. Allegedly, the 1980 release's newly recorded music soundtrack covered up the clumsy edit, so that the remaining choreography was in sync. Subsequent releases to video have used optical tricks to remove the appearance of black centaurs, so that the original music track scans properly.<br /><br />In this \\"restored\\" version, these optical edits are still glaringly obvious. (E.g., an optical zoom to avoid the black centaurette shows you the film grain up close, in another shot, a green bush magically slides across the ground by itself!)<br /><br />The film survives as a masterpiece of filmic art, and this presentation of a \\"politically correct, original version\\" (my description) is tempting. But Disney does this release, and all customers and fans, a disservice by inappropriately calling it a \\"restored\\" and \\"uncut\\" version, when in fact it is NOT the version that was seen in the 1940 road shows.<br /><br />Let your buying conscience be your guide, but consider the significance of buying an \\"original, restored\\" version that is neither, and perpetuates revisionist cuts as if they never happened.
0679745653|3.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's relates the story of Holly Golightly.  If the name Golightly sounds somewhat contrived to your ear as it does to mine then you might not be shocked to learn that the character seems just as contrived and unrealistic.  Holly is meant to be one of those exceptional people who breeze through life on sheer force of personality, oozing charisma and eccentric charm.  Unfortunately, she never quite rings true.  Her dialog is just a bit too breezy and her manner a touch too above-it-all.  She's such a stereotype of this type of person that she comes across as more of parody than a real person.<br /><br />Breakfast at Tiffany's is not awful by any means.  Capote is a master wordsmith and at times his prose is compelling enough to draw you into the story.  Unfortunately, there are too many moments that don't quite ring true to make this a must read.  If you want to try Capote for the first time I would recommend [[ASIN:0679745580 In Cold Blood]].  It is a far better book with much more substantial characters.
B00005Q3KC|1.0|I was dissapointed with this album. I'm not terribly familiar with the band but I got this CD as a present. If I knew the shop where it was bought I'd be tempted to bring  it back. As a huge fan of Irish music (especially anything by the Cranberries and U2), it annoys me to see bands like this try to tag along on their coattails.
0446608955|2.0|This book ... but thank God I saw the movie first. The book was only good for one thing . It helped to clarify the title of the movie and book. In the book Landon is not that bad boy that lured girls in the movie. He is as cookie cutter as they come. Jamie is absolutely perfect though. Nothing about her changed. Save all your money to buy the movie and skip this stupid book. you won't regret it.
B000063CPL|5.0|After being a Maiden fan for a 17th year now, I thought nothing could surprise me anymore. But this is just something else. I was swept away by the sheer power of the performance. All songs sound great enhanced with three guitars and especially by superb drumming of Mr. Nicko McBrain, but my absolute favourites are Ghost Of The Navigator, Wrathchild, Sign Of The Cross(it's such a great song that no matter who sings it, it'll still come out great) and Fear Of The Dark.
B00001QEE8|5.0|First of all, I would like to warn DVD buyers out there. There are many unlicensed copies of The Jungle Book as with many other Disney Videos. Most sellers of These Videos will use Phrases Such as, \\"All region,\\" \\"Import,\\" \\"Imported,\\" \\"Will Play In All VCR's,\\" \\"Does not have original case or artwork\\" \\"Does not have insert,\\" \\"No Chapter index,\\" etc. These Are not official US releases, Nore are they Official Disney Releases! They may be much cheaper, but The quality is not the same! You get What you Pay for!  <br />With that out of the way, I would also like to say that I love the Movie. It has been one of my favorites since I was a little boy.
0875845851|5.0|I actually read this a year or two ago, and I have found myself regularly referring to lessons presented in Clayton's excellent book, without having to reference or photocopy anything.<br />Of particular value was the examples used to illustrate the book's core points.  Examples were great because I have been able to easily recall them when explaining why the path I recommend is probably the right one, in a way that never fails to impress the point upon the listening audience.<br />Case in point: the book uses the hard drive industry a great deal as an example of how companies easily overlook the potential of what the author calls &quot;disruptive technologies.&quot;<br />In this case, technology advancements enabled hard drives to get smaller, and the sales/marketing forces within the respective manufacturers' repeatedly failed to see the use or value in a product that begins as simpler, cheaper, and easier to use.<br />You can almost hear the objections: &quot;Our drives have X storage space.  No one is going to buy one with half the storage capacity, even if it is smaller and cheaper.&quot;  No one gets excited about small sales when they are facing big ones with their current product line.<br />So the technology's strategic value is overlooked, and the innovation ends up being capitalized upon by smaller competitors who can plant and grow an emerging market because they get excited about smaller volume sales.  They have the energy and drive to find markets that don't necessarily need the rich feature set associated with the current product.<br />Inevitably, of course, these smaller sales dwarf the originating technology and its associated marketing and sales efforts, by cannibalizing the market and becoming the mainstream product.<br />Clayton's book outlines excellent strategies for companies seeking to capitalize upon disruptive technologies developed within their walls.  They make sense, and are easy to grasp.<br />In all, one of the better books I've read, in terms of short and long term impact to my ability to present solution.  Well worth the money.ad, in terms of short and long term impact to my ability to present solution.  Well worth the money.
0679777547|4.0|I came to this book after multiple viewings of &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, an excellent interpretation of the novel which unfortunately changes the setting (from Spain to New York) in order to appeal to American consumers.  I love the movie, but hoped to gain more insight into the final scene by reading the original text.<br />I loved many of the same things in the book as I enjoyed in the movie:  the seedy world of underground book detectives and collectors in a wonderful setting, and ought to be used more often.  Lucas Corso in particular should return for further adventures, as he's a very fun character to read: very intelligent and well-read, with nerdy hobbies (book-hunting and Napoleonic battle recreation) and regrets about past relationships.  He's a unique everyman, which is a tough thing to pull off.<br />The writing style (in the English translation) carried the characterization and plot well, too.  I became interested in the lives of these dusty old books, and very few authors could have accomplished a similar feat.<br />The plot begins strong--similar to but not parallel to the movie.  There a whole extra plot in the book which took some getting used to, and which turned out to be more tightly crafted than the Nine Doors plot--the plot I'd hoped to read more about.<br />But in the end, the book failed to satisfy my craving for more knowledge about that plot.  It becomes more and more interesting right up until the end, and then doesn't really go anywhere--at least, not anywhere satisfying.  I understand the desire to keep the mystery intact, but this can be done in a more reader-friendly way.<br />Anyhow, it's a worthwhile read, especially if you like off-kilter mysteries, and if you've read The Three Musketeers (which I have not).
B000021YQV|5.0|SYSTEM OF A DOWN's TOXICITY is the greatest hard rock album of 2001 and System Of A Down is one of the best bands out of the so called &quot;NU-METAL&quot; scene. This is a great album because it is heavy and fast and has meaning. System Of A Down is a Excellent band. My favorite songs on this album are: <BR>      Needles<BR>      Deer Dance<BR>      Chop Suey<BR>      Bounce<BR>      Forest<BR>      Toxicity<BR>      Psycho<BR>      Aerials
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'm a devout metalhead.  I've got an enormous library of death metal, hard core, thrash... slayer, slipknot, deicide, dimmu borgir, and lately i've been told many times that i should \\"diversify\\" my listening habbits.  I was watching an episode of Uranium (the only heavy metal tv show there is), afterwards the first music video that came on was \\"don't know why\\", by norah jones.  Her voice flows like smoke, the melodies are absoloutly original and classic, and welcomely stick to your brain like wet spaghetti.  The lyrics are amazing, too.  They're powerful, memorable, intelligent, and full of content. <br />It's her voice, though.  Her voice just makes your heart ache like it's being squeezed with an iron fist.  All songs are recommended.  I can listen to this album end to end all day and it's always so pleasant and welcome to my ears.  I've trashed or sold a good many of my metal cds because this one stays in my stereo all week.  <br />Shear beauty.  I'll be listening to this one for years.
B00000IGGA|5.0|First heard about this dude a while back, and until I actually heard one of his CD's I always assumed he was some sort of Country/Western musician (So yes, in addition to being ignorant I'm also a little bit less biased than some of the more hardcore Waits fans...though I soon may become one).  I can't believe what he has accomplished on this album!  As a \\"jazz-based\\" guitar player I have to say the free-form style, the phrasing of the vocals, and syncopation of the more bizarre tracks (Eyeball Kid, Filapino Box Spring Hog) are a real treat, if for no other reason than I haven't heard anything like this since Capt. Beefheart (Waits/Beefheart, same person? You be the judge.).  Definitely has a style that differs from everyone else out there right now, and you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who won't at least concede that his music is \\"interesting\\".  Even the more mundane piano-based tracks are well done, not so much for the musicianship but for the intricacy of the lyrics. <br />Very dark, very strange, and very good!!!
0783226063|4.0|For all those who love the epic novel, and the following books, this movie is well done and to the point.  But for those who LOVE the book, it is underdone.... Don't get me wrong, what we can see and hear is undeniably great cinematography and true to the heart of Herberts masterpiece.  But there are many gaps and lapses that a release of the full film could fill.  As i understand it the original production would run near 3 hours and that would suit me just fine.  Paul and his Fremen are the center of the book, with the Harkonnens running a close second.  Paul Atreidies is played aptly by Kyle and almost all the other characters are pretty close matches to the actors... Kudos to the understated role of Duke Leto played by Jurgen Prochnow.  This film is great for a companion to the book, but it just left me wanting to see more of Lynch's stunning interpretation.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Where can i start on saying on how funny this film is. It is about a male model growing up then wanting to reitre.

These two models go through a lot but in the end this movie is quite hilarious.
B00003CY6M|4.0|GENERAL: While predictible, Serendipity makes a good rental that will leave with a happy feeling.<BR>ACTING: Good, especially from John Cusack as a man yearning for a woman he met and fell in love with one evening. Heck, even Kate Beckinsdale and Molly Shannon hold their own.<BR>PLOT: Like I said before, fairly predictable but interesting none the less. Basically, two people in New York meet one night and fall in love. But the woman, and New Age-ish type, believes that they weren't meant to be together unless something unlikely happens- like him finding a book with her phone number in it, or her finding a $5 bill his his on it. Slightly goofy but something new.<BR>COMEDY: There are some hilarious moments, and those that just fall flat. Could have been better in my opinion.<BR>MUSIC: A good soundtrack, better quality than other aspects of this movie. Definitely worth borrowing from a library.<BR>SPECIAL FEATURES: Very good for a romantic comedy, especially the deleted scenes with an alternate beginning. Very interesting and of a generally high quality, the specs won't disappoint.<BR>MY GRADE: B
B000001G16|5.0|No longer stuck in the shadow of also brilliant band Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora is one of the greatest guitarists of his generation.  Not only can he play, but he is a proven songwriter, a talent which not many &quot;big stars&quot; of today posess.  Unfortunately, he is not nearly given the credit he deserves.  Stranger in this Town is very soulful and bluesy rock and roll, with a little help from another excellent guitarist, and legend, Eric Clapton.  <BR>Sambora demonstrates that his voice can also be powerful and moving.  Not to downplay his talent with guitar, but his voice is that of a lead singer; strong, versatile and distinctive.  (Although no one would be able to come close to filling his shoes as the guitarist in Bon Jovi).  If you're a blues fan, rock fan, Bon Jovi fan, or all three, you would love Richie Sambora's Stranger in This Town.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|GENERAL: I rented this movie with mixed hopes- on one hand, the critics had trashed it, while on another most customer reviews were positive. I'm now very glad that I veiwed The Time Machine and would recommend it to anyone.<BR>ACTING: Suprisingly good. Guy Pearce gives a convinvcing performance Alexander Hardtgen, a professor who builds a time machine in order to go back and save a loved one who died. Samantha Mumba, the semi-famous popstar, actually was decent at Mara, and girl living in the future and trying to take care of her younger brother.<BR>PLOT: Very gripping, yet short and sweet, this movie speeds up after the first few minutes and really sports some interesting concepts. Original and something you'll have to see twice.<BR>SPECIAL EFFECTS: The SFX, by Digital Domain, are wonderful and create some of the most amazing effects seqences ever when Alex travels millions of years into the future while in his time machine. Beautiful and realistic.<BR>SCORE(MUSIC): Beautifully done and original. The music, infused with breathtaking tribal chants at times, is of a high standard and memorable.<BR>SPECIAL FEATURES: Very good for a single disc DVD, there are some interesting &quot;making of&quot; featurettes along with a wonderful segment about how Digital Domain created several effects sequences. Overall very good.<BR>MY GRADE: A-
0345340426|1.0|Okay, it might have been good 50 years ago, but after reading a bunch of fantasy books and SF and playing nearly every RPG from ten years back, this book offers nothing new, no provocative ideas and no surprises. It's just an overlong travelogue with generic D&amp;D-like characters.<br />Yeah, this book was written before there was anything like D&amp;D and most fantasy fiction but I look at it from today's perspective and the verdict is: BORING!

B000059POY|1.0|A hip and wacky sex comedy featuring Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, Ringo Starr, John Huston and a thousand other people, and based on a book by Terry Southern--sounds pretty good, don't it? Guess what? It's not.<br />Candy is completely unfunny, if not depressing. Poor Richard Burton, licking whiskey off the floor! The various targets for its satire are the military (edgy!), surgeons (they asked for it!), mysticism (take that!), the police (burn!) and intellectual pop idols (huh?). The references to sex and drugs have lost whatever titillation/shock value they might have had thirty years ago, so don't expect to get much payoff out of John Astin with the joint behind his ear or the big transvestite scene. It's not particularly sexy, either. Who wants to see Walter Matthau, Ringo Starr or a hunchbacked Charles Aznavour manhandling a lobotomy patient? (I'm sure Ewa Ulin is/was a very nice person with lots of great qualities, but come on). <br />Connoisseurs of the weird will prize this movie, but, to whatever degree one can be objective about these things, Candy is not a good film. There's nothing particularly fun, witty, or meaningful about it. It's just embarassing. And honestly, I've seen much weirder. Any ten minutes of Godard's Weekend is more bizarre, gutsy and anti-establishment than all of Candy. <br />If you must watch sixties drug culture comedies, The Magic Christian is better.
B0000542D2|5.0|I thought I'd weigh in  about the recent review from the Pop Fan from Hollywood: I sincerely believe those comments (with a thouroughly mis-leading 1-star rating) are a put-on, an exercise in sarcasm, in effect mocking today's pop scene, with pre-constructed, non-instrument-playing, non-song-writing (non-talented? maybe that's going too far) groups.  And it's beautifully done sarcasm at that - that review isn't about the Beatles, it a critique of what's missing in pop today, the very thing the Beatles possessed in abundance.  But The Beatles reputation for absolute first-class talent should preclude any real need at this point to justify their value.  And \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", well-described by many other positive reviews here, is a wonderful early expression of that talent.  I eagerly await the DVD release!

B00000099Y|5.0|Obviously nobody can tell you what you should or should not like in music.  If you like bubblegum pop or &quot;I love you/ I miss you&quot; lyrics, thats your thing.  I can tell you one thing though.  Since ive bought this cd when it came out, there has been no record that has spent more time in my cd player.  (Of course Lateralus has taken a place in its own right).  There is nothing more that you could possibly want in rock music.  It is beautiful, aggressive, and amazingly deep.  Of course not everyone has the attention span and the brain capacity to realize the &quot;amazingly deep&quot; part (looking up lyrics is a must).  This album must be experienced, and by that i mean not taken lightly and given a once spin over in your CD player.  Tool is a 4- man group, but there music has that 5th person (spirit if you will) that very, very few groups have.  They are individuals that feed off of each other to create music unlike anything else. Tool is one of the only groups that have hype worth believing.  They are out there, and if you want something that could change the way you listen to music forever, i suggest you do your best to discover them.
B000068TPN|5.0|We Were Soldiers is by far the best movie I've seen in some time.  Mel Gibson really showed his ability to command a movie dispite having a very good supporting cast.  I watched the movie three times and had only had two days.  Simply EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|this is a fun filled movie with action and a lot of fun for the whole family. they did a great job with the special effects and relates a lot to the book. this is a must have for harry potter fans and for those who want to see a great movie.
0783226128|5.0|Has anyone noticed how funny this movie is? From the sanitation/sanitarium mixup to Tony's first turn on the dance floor to his jacuzzi of Olympic proportions to the classic \\"Say hello to my leetle friend,\\" the script (by Oliver Stone) is a riot. The question is, Is it SUPPOSED to be a riot? I have to think so.
B0000640VO|5.0|Don't miss this movie!! As I watched \\"Amelie\\", I found myself grinning like an idiot and I couldn't stop humming and smiling for the next few hours. This truly is a feel-good movie! Even my husband admitted it was a great movie even though he initially didn't want to see what he had labeled a \\"chick flick\\". This movie appeals to all ages and races, and there aren't many movies you can say that about.
B00000JLWW|1.0|In my personal opinion, this was the greatest cinemactic bastardization of an historical event ever made.<BR>Sure it's special effects and accurate ship set were touted forever in a day when it came out, and implications were aplenty that-despite the fictional love story and all that kind of jazz-, it somehow evoked the real-life events of that fateful first-and only-voyage of the Royal Mail Steamship Titanic...but in reality the makers-historical advisers and all-didn't even come within hailing distance of the real story.  Instead they sliced open the real Titanic story, removed alot of good history that would have been excellent material for historical drama-and instead inserted an aggravatingly contrived and poorly done love story with equally aggravatingly contrived (and cliched) fictional characters.  And the real-life Titanic people that were included in the script as characters played second-fiddle to the fictional characters and were just one of the many, many misleading histoical facets of this drama.<BR>For example: there is an outrageoulsy contrived bit of dialogue uttered in a scene more fit for a bad comic book by Second Officer Lightoller whgen he threatens passengers crowding some port side lifeboats (IIRC) with his revolver and says something like: \\"Get back, or I'll shoot you down like dogs.\\"<BR>It is true that Lightoller did wave his revolver at passengers that seemed about to rush the last port side lifeboat successfuly launched that night, Collapsible D, (and may have even fired it in the air once or twice), but it is extremely doubtful that he said suche cliched, tired words when he did.  Just one of the many, many misinterpreations of character that plagued the depiction of the real-life Titanic passengers & crew depicted in the movie.<BR>\\"Titanic\\" not only was incredibly inaccurate and absurd in some of it's vignettes (i.e. First Class passengers in the forward grand staircase as it floods, passengers foundering about in the water covering C-Deck right below the bridge like geese with their heads lopped off by sabres, plus all the horrid sequences in which Mr. DiCaprio and Miss Winslet founder about deep down inside the ship as it floods.  A stund that only would have ensured you a ticket across the Jordan in real life), it also lacked the saving storytelling graces that made films like \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"A Night To Remember\\", and \\"The Longest Day (for example) such classics of historical drama.<BR>The characters of Jack Dawson, Rose DeWitt Buktor, Calvin Hokeyhooey...er, Hockely (pardon the sarcasam), etc. completely lack the factual basis characters like, say, Hilts (\\"Cooler King\\"), Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, and Danny (\\"Tunnel King\\") had in \\"The Great Escape.\\"  They also weren't very well-drawn characters in any case, as opposed to the above mentioned \\"Great Escape\\" characters.  Dawson, Buktor, & co. were more like one-dimensonal wind-up toy sort of characters that do all the predictable stuff a bad drama posesses.<BR>In essance, the success of this movie was a fluke.  No more, no less...and the cultural excesses of it's success coated the memory of the real-life Titanic story with so much cultural junk that it will take a good-quality, stricly factual historial drama to burn it all off.<BR>\\"Titanic\\" was a long way short of being the great movie it was hailed as, and will forever remain the greatest misinterpreation of an historial event on film ever made.  Lets hope Hollywood has the guts to GET IT RIGHT the next time!
0316666343|4.0|I had a love/hate relationship with this book because I couldn't put it down, even when I had important things to do! This is not really an intellectual novel, but everyone needs to read some fluffy books sometimes. This is a very unique book told from the perspective of a murdered teenage girl who watches the aftermath of her disappearance unfold from beyond the grave. The story itself is riveting, but the way the book is written makes it even better. I came across portions of the book that were so beautifully written, I had to read them again. Sure, parts of the book are a little out there, but it definitely makes you think about what happens when we die. If you are looking for a \\"guilty pleasure\\" read that is out-of-the-ordinary, choose this book.
B00005JKZT|5.0|'The Two Towers' may even be more anticipated than the Fellowship.  How is that possible?  Well take a look at the trailor if ou have any doubts.  Especially after the events of Sept. 11 the title is even more eery than what Tolkien could have ever imagined.  When I first read the novel I thought to myself, 'how are they going to pull this off?'  Well they did it with imagination, determination and creativity.  Holding the perfect scenery and costum design, this movie captured the spirit of middle earth in one of its most perilous moments. Death in darkness and hope in light seemed to be a recurruing theme through-out the battle scenes and on Frodo's journey.  But the charater who stole the show was Brad Dourif's Wormtounge.  He was creepy to look and and he held the essence of his character in his pocket with grace and malignancy.  I know that this movie will surpass all expectations as it delivers an unreal world with real visions and dialogue.  The detail is more than enthralling, it is overwhelming at its worst.  The new characters introduced in the second chapter push the story to new hights, developing intertwining conflicts and subterfuge through-out a story of death, life, good, evil and everything in between.  An amalgan of emotions dives the viewer into a unpresidented sense of absorbtion following not just the actors,but the colors, the scenery, the costum, the music and the life begotten from pain and suffering in an attempt to minimalise the push of Sauron's power.  See it, see it four times, it will inspire you with each passing.

0140177396|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read in my life.  There are some sad moments and some kind of sick moments but that is what makes this book so great.  There are all kinds of characters that are portraid perfect.  The story is proably the best out of everything in the book.  Two friends go to find work after they are ran out of another town for harming a woman.  Yet there troubles are not yet over.
B00005JKHP|4.0|This is my second favorite of the Star Trek movies.  It is so wondrfully done with imagination and brilliantly written dialogue.  A massive object is approaching Earth with a deadly force capable of wiping out the entire planet. It is up to Kirk, Spock and the crew to fight past its defences to descover its vulnerability and save the planet from untter enialation.  The score is beautiful, the costums are rediculas and the effects are masterful.  I think Gene would have been proud of how it was turned out after having so many production problems leading up to its initial release.  The did not take away from the movie at all-only added.  My only issue corresponds with some of the scenes that were cut from the full version.  Some of the greatest conversations were left out???  Anyway, a worthy movie that was missread by many Star Trek fans as they were expecting slam,bag,action instead of intelligence-the problem with most sci-fi movies these days including the last three star treks.  If you give it chance and follow the story and dialogue and character development, then you will hopefully appreciate a movie tha was very similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey.
B00000JZI9|5.0|At last, a film that meets our expectations of what we would like to think the wild west was really like. SILVERADO has everything you could want in a western: Clearly identifiable bad guys, shining heroes and a lot of pistol and rifle action.<br /><br />Much like the westerns of the '30's and '40's, the gunshots in this film rarely seem to cause the victims to incur any noticeable wounds as they fall to the ground. Likewise are no slow motion death scenes in this film. This picture could fit into the mold of a western fantasy, but is much more believeable when compared against THE QUICK AND THE DEAD or THE UNFORGIVEN.<br /><br />You cannot enjoy this film if you examine it too closely.  There are any number of faux pas to support that this was not meant to be a documentary about the true old west. If you want reality, watch The History Channel.  This movie is meant to be fun.<br /><br />The main participants, both good and bad, are impeccably dressed. Indeed, when SILVERADO was in the theaters it could have reaped additional dollars by selling a western apparel store by the candy concession. SILVERADO contains strong performances by Scott Glen, Kevin Kline, Danny Glover, Kevin Costner and Brian Denahey. The story is fast-paced and Bruce Broughton's soundtrack is wonderful.<br /><br />Upstaging this already great film is the Sante Fe area New Mexico scenery surrounding, what was then, a newly constructed western town set. If the set looks familiar, it is because the same outdoor set was reused for WYATT EARP.<br /><br />The film's only shortcoming is that some of the scenes do not transition well.  You sometimes find yourself wondering if you missed a couple chapter somewhere.  As the director's commentary on the DVD notes there were several subplots trimmed from the finished film. You might notice that Rosanna Arquette seems to be in the movie for seemingly no reason at all.  In fact, when I first saw this film I was confused when it appeared that Kevin Kline was wooing Arquette, and out of nowhere we have a scene where Arquette all but takes Scott Glen to task for saying good-bye.  We were obviously short changed on the missing Kline-Arquette-Glen love triangle.<br /><br />Also look for Monty Python alumnus John Cleese in a role that is almost befitting a spin-off movie of his own. Now available on DVD in widescreen, this is a must for your DVD collection. If by the end of this film you do not have the urge to grab a sheepskin jacket, run out the door to right wrongs and protect the innocent, then you should see the film a second time.e we have a scene where Arquette all but takes Scott Glen to task for saying good-bye.

B000055Y0X|5.0|Kubrick's funniest movy tells a tale of unwanted war and the means that men will go to survive.  The characters are shallow, callous and purlie-truely brilliant.  I loved the satire behind the severity of the subject-nuclear war.  Only Kubrick could put such a flippiat voice to such a dangerous topic durring such a perilous time.  He did it with the camera, acting and the late great Peter Sellers.  Sellers shines in three differnt roles, playing a US president, a British officer and a German scientist-Dr. Strangelove.  The irony developed is unfogettable as the Russian embasitor enters the US military strategy room trying to solve the conflict of imminent doom and George C Scott's character is overtly concerned with security of the Russian spying on their plans.  If you like Wes Anderson movies-Bottle Rocket, Rushmore or The Royal Tennenbaum's-then see this movie.  It is clever, very funny and a Stanley Kubrick movie.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is another of the recent trend ( \\"Blackhawk Down\\", \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\") to make war movies based on true stories. Here, the war is in Vietnam, and as most know, it was a war that sharply divided the Country (in fact, the last \\"fuss\\" that I engaged in was in objection to a fellow that needed a bath & haircut who was cussing out a soldier in an airport). This film operates at several levels. First is the basic (if one can describe such courage and dedication under that rubric) story of LTC Hal Moore and his airmobile regiment in the Ia Drang Valley, called \\"the valley of death\\", in 1965. More important to ,me, at least, was the depiction of Moore as a commander DEEPLY committed to his men, as well as to his mission. There is also the aspect of a clear sense of failed support, both from Moore's superiors and from the Federal Government. Finally, there is a moving segment that shows the effects on the home front, as casualty telegrams are received by the soldiers' families. To tell more would spoil the unfolding story of this excellent film. It is a very realistic reinactment, and as such is an effective reminder as to what happens when we ask our young men and women to go in harm's way. Soldiers don't make policy or start wars; they follow orders and go where they are sent. It has been very gratifying to see the development of Mel Gibson as an actor since the \\"Mad Max\\" days, and his performance here is simply compelling. All of the cast perform well, but I make special note of Madeline Stowe's outstanding portrayal of LTC Moore's wife; she is a beautiful woman and an excellent actress; if you are not moved by her performance, you lack a heart. Also, the very talented Sam Elliott is perfect in the role of Moore's VERY tough Sargeant Major. Visually, the film is fantastic: the combat scenes are gut-wrenching, rivalling those in \\"Blackhawk Down\\". Sonically, the disc offers Dolby 5.1EX, so be prepared for complaints from the neighbors. I underscore the realism of thecombat scenes. While such are always \\"troubling\\" to watch in the sense of the reality of war, if you, as a potential viewer, cannot handle such scenes, pass on. However, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is an outstanding tribute to the brave men and women who followed orders in the Vietnam War, and, I suspect, to the men and women in uniform today. It's a great movie!
0440180295|4.0|Vonnegut truely out did himself in this story, delivering a tale revealing the effects of war on society, individuals and family.  It taught me a lot about the end of the second world war as the story is partiallly placed in Dresden before, during and after its bombing and placed on another planet-according to the protagonist, who can travel through time-where aliens put him in an inhuman zoo with a female of our species.  It is original, funny, depressing and uplifting.  A work of imagination and much thought, as it is an American classic.  I am looking forward to reading more from Vonnedut.
B000006TRV|5.0|I just ordered the cd, but I think it is great. Gilmour is a genius songwriter and a really good guitarist. Water's lyrics are probably the best I've ever heard.\\"Comfortably Numb\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time.My other favorites were\\"Hey You,\\" \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part II,\\" \\"Young Lust, and\\"Run like Hell,\\" Plus, this album was the third most sold album of all time, next to michael jackson thriller and eagles greatest hits. It sold about 25 million copies. Definetely not a waste of money.
B000006E17|1.0|Depravity far worse than that depicted in the film exists in the world today, acts far more violent and horrendous. Nonetheless, their representation without any moral standpoint is immoral because it proposes that the morality of extreme violence is up for debate. It simply isn't. Depicting brutality such as this film does without condemning it is to open the possibility that we accept it without thinking, the ultimate in moral perversion. The proper response to watching this film is to stop; to continue is to indulge, and I mean indulge, not explore, the absolute worst elements of the filmmaker and the human beast.
B00005LC4B|5.0|Martin Scorcese directs this thriller about revenge and sin. Based on the original 1962 film \\"Cape Fear\\", starring Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, this story is a bit different, and more interesting. Robert De Niro brilliantly portrays the role of Max Cady, a Southern, tattoo-riddled, cigar smoking ex-con, who seeks vengeance on his former lawyer, Sam Bowden, for doing an inadequate job at defending him on the charge of rape. You see, Sam got a report that the rape victim was promiscious, but he buried the report. Cady's sentence could have been reduced, had the report been featured, but instead he spent fourteen years in prison. Max Cady is clever, so that the law can't touch him. So, he can easily slip in and out of the Bowden household whenever he pleases, and stalk Sam wherever he goes. Meanwhile, Sam goes through his own troubles with his family: his wife, Leigh, doesn't trust him because he had an affair, and his teenage daughter, Danielle, is going through adolescent troubles. There is an especially brilliant and eerie scene in which Cady tries to pyschologically seduce Danielle, posing as her drama teacher. \\"Wait a second...you're not my drama teacher, are you?\\" \\"Maybe I'm the big bad wolf\\". It finally comes down to a violent showdown on a houseboat at Cape Fear River. But, since Sam Bowden, in this version, is definitely not a hero, it is somewhat intricate to tell who shall be the victor. To find out, you will have to watch this film yourself. A marvelous movie that all horror/suspense film fans should love. Robert De Niro does a marvelous job as playing Max Cady, and Juliet Lewis equally portrays Danielle Bowden. Jessica Leing does a great job as Sam's wife, Leigh, and Martin Scorcese directs it wonderfully! My only complaint is Nick Nolte. He didn't really get into his part except for on certain scenes. Oh, well. It's still definitely worth renting or buying! \\"Counselor, counselor. Come out, come out, wherever you are!\\" \\"I think we're alone now.\\" \\"Well,it's a small town, I guess everywhere you turn, we're gonna run into each other\\".-Max Cady quotes.
B00000JZC4|5.0|It seems to be the massively popular trend today to do one of two things.  You should either have a record of pure emotion, or a record of pure rock.  Very few bands seem to be able to combine these two into a melody of haunting, blissful rock.  Title of Record is an exception among millions and millions of CDs, and remains one of the best CDs ever to be released in the history of CDs being released.  Richard Patrick, the lead singer, guitarist and lyricist (heck, the core that is Filter) is a genius when it comes to making the most haunting, emotional songs possible.  However, what makes him a total genius is the fact that he can make the songs have a dynamite kick, making them songs you can listen to over and over again.  An example is the ballad 'I'm Not The Only One.'  The way this song starts out makes me think of a dark church on a dark night in the middle of some small mountain town while mist envelops the gravestones that surround it.  It's melody of echoing children's voices singing is so haunting that it will give you chills.  However, the song does not stay in this ball park for long, and eventually progresses into an emotional scream-fest, showing the versatility with which this band has mastered so well.<br />Some songs are just flat out rock, some are flat out emotion, and they are all amazing, but what really brings out the talent in this band are the songs like 'I'm Not the Only One' and 'Take a Picture' showing you that they are not just shallow rockers, but poets with melody, a unique sound and a message they long to share.<br />It would be a crime to not pick up this CD, it really would.
B00005JKJA|3.0|What the heck did I just see??? That was my thought immediately after watching this film. I'm not sure why anyone would want to spend their precious time trying to find an explanation for what happens in this thing after seeing it. All attempts will fail. Or maybe all attempts will succeed. Either way, this is Bizarro world brought to the big screen. It's kind of creepy and it does wrap you up and hold your attention, even though as it progresses you have less and less grasp of what is going on. By the end I was confounded and dumbfounded. I give it five stars for keeping me riveted to the screen and zero stars for after-viewing satisfaction. I may watch this again to see if it actually does make some sense.  But, as one of the great unwashed, unlike many of these pretentious, film genius reviewers who spend all day with this DVD in a loop and then countless hours disecting it because they decry being \\"spoonfed\\" their films (By the way, since that word seems to show up in so many reviews about this film, I wonder if Capra, Griffith, Keaton, Chaplin, or even Hitchcock ever complained about \\"spoonfeeding\\" their audiences with pure entertainment.), I don't need an answer to this puzzle or have a need to supply some film-school artistic interpretation.  If you like being twisted around the mind of David Lynch, this is something for you. Otherwise, stay away...
B00005YW4H|4.0|...With the first few notes that this amazing woman sings, you become entranced. Her voice echoes some of jazz music's legendary greats, with the smoky feel of Ella Fitzgerald and the flow of some of the smoother jazz singers of the time.  <br />Come Away With Me is not the typical jazz recording, which is perhaps why Norah is becoming more mainstream, not just limited to jazz listeners. I have heard her played at public places and on radio stations that play only pop music. Some songs on this album have a country feel, others have more of a pop flow to them, but all have the amazing vocals of Norah sliding through the notes of the noticeably good band.<br />Most of the songs on this CD were written by her producer, and not by Norah herself, which may be a downfall of this album. Generally, songs sound better when they are sung with the passion of someone who understands the lyrics because they flowed from her hand, not someone else's. Regardless of whether or not she wrote them, Jones manages to remain in control of the songs. <br />The title track is buried deep in the CD, fourth on the list of twelve songs. The first song, however, titled \\"Don't Know Why\\", sets the tone of the CD as traditional jazz: \\"I feel as empty as a drum/don't know why I didn't come.\\" The third song is a cover of country music great Hank Williams' \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", beautifully sung with the powerful voice of Norah jazzing it up.<br />The bottom line is that the songs aren't that spectacular, but Norah's amazing voice makes this CD worth buying. Whether or not you like jazz, this CD is guaranteed to have something that everyone can enjoy...
B00004Y9PP|4.0|\\"Pitch Black\\" starts out like dozens of other movies; a small group of humans survives a crash landing on a seemingly deserted planet and discovers the remains of a human settlement. Then some nasty aliens show up. Luckily this movie quickly gets past the clichés. Sunlight is lethal to the aliens and this planet has three suns. The discovery that there's a total eclipse every 22 years and the next one is on the horizon gives the movie its jolt. <br />The main surprises in \\"Pitch Black\\" are the characters.  Instead of the typical cast of hero, agitator and victims, the writers  did a great job of making each distinct and memorable.  The meatiest role is the one of Riddick, played by Vin Diesel, a killer with the strength and personality of an alien monster himself. Riddick has a wonderfully ominous voice, the best lines in the film, a great presence, and coincidentally he's got surgically enhanced eyes that allow him to see in the dark. There are some other conveniences like that and a few inconsistencies but the film stays on target well. <br />I'm growing tired of seeing computer generated effects but I enjoyed them here, particularly the way these aliens move in mass. It's like watching an enormous flock of birds or swarm of insects--more realistic than the animation in \\"The Mummy Returns\\" but not as good as \\"Jurassic Park\\".  The best shot in the film is one of the monsters lit up for a split second while closing in on a guy who ends up being dinner.  There are some beautiful horizon shots of the eclipsing planet's rings which take a great deal of photographic liberty.   (Two planets couldn't possibly be that close without one of them suffering real damage and you don't have to know much science to know that.)  <br />Despite the problems, \\"Pitch Black\\" is a better film than you'd expect it to be and could easily become cult favorite. Fans of Vin Diesel or science fiction films like the original \\"Alien\\" will enjoy watching this one more than once.

Generally, songs sound better when they are sung with the passion of someone who understands the lyrics because they flowed from her hand, not someone else's. Regardless of whether or not she wrote them, Jones manages to remain in control of the songs. <br />The title track is buried deep in the CD, fourth on the list of twelve songs. The first song, however, titled \\"Don't Know Why\\", sets the tone of the CD as traditional jazz: \\"I feel as empty as a drum/don't know why I didn't come.\\" The third song is a cover of country music great Hank Williams' \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", beautifully sung with the powerful voice of Norah jazzing it up.<br />The bottom line is that the songs aren't that spectacular, but Norah's amazing voice makes this CD worth buying. Whether or not you like jazz, this CD is guaranteed to have something that everyone can enjoy.<br />Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Media, Inc.

B0000640VO|5.0|No doubt we'd be more suspicious of a good-natured film like this were it not made outside the US by people who can make us believe.  Audrey Tatou is the prettiest and most expressive female face to make an entrance on the international scene in a long time.  This is a beautiful, whimsical, and yes, quirky (yet not irksome) movie about loneliness, imagination, love, and courage.  <br />The lush, glowing red, green, and blue of Montmarte creates the kind of Parisian fantasy and fantastic Paris everyone conjures in their dreams.  Only talented (relative)unknowns can get away with performances like this one, and they make waiting for them worthwile.  The art direction, editing, and effects are also first-rate.<br />The DVD has the usual set of goodies like director's commentary, interviews, and other junk.  Widescreen version was crisp and vibrant.  So see this movie and allow yourself to be seduced by its charm.
B000063US7|4.0|This is a great DVD, too bad the packaging is sooo shabby and the documentation is so poor. You would think for the price this company is charging for this dvd you would get:1} a nice case. 2} nice booklet outlining the concert with photos and song listings Plus Plus Plus. No booklet no photos, not one ounce of documentation anywhere to be found, just two really flimsy discs in the cheapest case I have ever gotten a dvd in. At 50$+ This is the most I have ever paid for a DVD. Its really a shame that they don't give  one of the best bands of all time and great concert overall, the packing and care it deserves.Even the DVDs themselfs look shabby at this price  no excuse for this.In the future I will avoid GutDVD, they really gutted this package and charged out the Ying yang. At least the music is still great they could not diminish that even though they tried their hardest.
B000005H40|4.0|For those who are considering buying this CD, there's a better version that you may consider getting instead of this one.  That one is titled &quot;The Ultimate Blue Train&quot; (1997) with the same cover photo but contains all the tracks on this one plus two extra tracks which are alternate takes of &quot;Blue Train&quot; and &quot;Lazy Bird&quot;.  Thanks to SBM remastering, that other version also sounds much more lively than this one.  &quot;The Ultimate Blue Train&quot; is also enhanced with multimedia which you can play on the PC with video as well.  However, if you can't get &quot;The Ultimate Blue Train&quot;, you should at least get this classic recording of John Coltrane without which no Jazz collection is complete.  In fact, this &quot;Blue Train&quot; is already a very good one.  It's only that &quot;The Ultimate Blue Train&quot; is even better.
B0000041Z5|5.0|It's hard to believe this recording is only ADD... Decca always has the best recording technologies. In these performances, you hear each and every important line or motive in Brahms's intricate polyphonic layout. The result is an everlasting pleasure of the work of a genius, a feeling that you get the entire contrapuntal complexity of the music. The recording engineers have given a bold emphasis to the brass winds (a feature prominent with other Decca-Solti recordings as well), and this contributes a lot to the richness of sound and texture, compared with other famous recordings (Karajan, for example) where one finds the traditional emphasis on the strings. I find this recording more balanced and better achieving a good perception of the polyphonic complexity of the music. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is of course one of the best orchestras in the world, and their playing is, as far as I can grasp, flawless. As to Solti's conducting, well, here one might say justifiably that other great conductors (Karajan and Barenboim, for example) are just as good, or, even more interesting and inventive. Solti's conducting is, one could say, minimalist - he refrains from complex rubatos, avoids changes of tempos beetween phrases, and doesn't employ any sophisticated phrasing. However, he is still a superb conductor, with his respectful contribution to the excellent instrumental balance of the performance, and he usually brings out successfully the emotionality of the music, and even better, the intricate structure.
031286504X|5.0|Richard Neville is the last human on earth, or so he thinks.  A strange plague has swept the world and has left in its wake an army of bloodthirsty creatures of the night.  Vampires are now the dominent lifeform on the planet and one man must fight for his life and his sanity in this new world.  At first he spends his time proofing his house from the vampires, and gathering supplies.  He then sets out to destroy every beast,  they must all die!  Soon he realizes they are to many and begins to study them, there must be a logical explanation for this horror. But are they the monsters or is he?<br />I never thought a 170 page book could enthrall me so.  I read this book in about 3 hrs, but it has been with me for much longer.  Richard becomes so realistic you start to forget he is not real.  The realism with which Matheson weaves his tale is uncanny.  I have read many vampire books and i think \\"I Am Legend\\" is by far the best i have read to date.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this book, I can't recommend it more.
B00003CXA6|4.0|Overall this is an outstanding movie. It portrays some of the horror of civil war combat very well. It also faithfully follows Shaara's wonderful novel excellently. However, that is also the problem with the movie. Shaara in his book gets much of the history quite wrong, particularly in his portrayal of Lee. Because the movie faithfully follows his book, this inaccurate portrayal of Lee as an old, tired man ends up in the movie. Also, there are many other errors, such as the Stonewall Brigade appearing in Pickett's Charge as well as the scene where the orders go out for it, are completely wrong.<BR>I think the movie would have been better had it used the dialogue formed by Shaara while gaining a better background for the characters involved, such as Lee, using other secondary sources by legitimate historians.
B000068TSI|5.0|WE WERE SOLDIERS<BR>*****<BR>THIS EXCELLENT PIECE OF ARTISTIC MASTERPIECE IS MEL GIBSONS BEST.  I'M GLAD MY MOM RENTED IT. NOVEMBER 1965 HAL MOORE LEADS A GROUP OF SOLDIERS TO WAR. SADLY VERY FEW OF THEM COME OUT. CHRIS KLEIN DESERVES AN OSCAR NOD FOR THIS MOVIE AND SO DOES MEL GIBSON BUT HES NO STRANGER TO OSCAR AND WILL PROBABLY WIN A FEW.   THIS MOVIE WAS MUCH MORE VIOLENT THAN BLACK HAWK DOWN AND SURPRISINGLY MORE REALISTIC. I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE MY FATHER WHO WAS IN THE VIETNAM WAR WATCHED IT AND SAID IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME.  HE SAID BLACK HAWK DOWN WAS NOTHING COMPARED  TO THIS. I AGREE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LOVES A GREAT WAR MOVIE LIKE GLORY.  RENT IT OR BETTER BUY THE DVD.
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber has gone on record (sorry about the pun) as intensely disliking recordings, especially loathing the studio recording process, which he thinks, with justification in this poor writer's opinion, distorts and perverts the art of music making.  This is the principal reason why the work of this notoriously mercurial and eccentric, but clearly genius-level world-class conductor is so regrettably underdocumented on recorded media, and why most all the recordings that do exist are of his live performances.<br />  Kleiber shares one characteristic with the late Leonard Bersnstein - he makes all music interesting.  How many times has the average musician in the Vienna Philharmonic performed these two most popular of Beethoven's symphonies?  As a symphonic musician myself, I would venture that most of them have long ago lost count.  Each player has performed these symphonies scores, if not hundreds of times in his career - under the batons of conductors ranging from the memorable to the pedestrian to the ...<br />  It is said that this venerable and legendary orchestra is incapable of a poor performance, no matter what overdressed ... may be standing upon the podium, spastically flailing away.  But the curse and greatest fear of every seasoned orchestral musician is not that his or her playing skills may fail him.  His greatest fear is BOREDOM!  How many times can you perform Beethoven's 5th and 7th symphonies until you have nothing left to say?  Until there is nothing left to discover?  Until you step on your ya-ya and miss a repeat in the third movement because you were thinking about your tanking marriage, your disintegrating old jalopy, your pregnant and ...15-year-old daughter - anything except where you were supposed to be, intensely focused on your music?<br />  The Vienna Philharmonic, from this reviewer's experience, IS incapable of a bad performance.  But unfortunately it isn't incapable of a boring one.  Except, that is, when Carlos Kleiber is the maestro.  There is a discipline and attention to minute detail, and a white-hot intensity to these performances that is extremely rare and extremely precious.<br />  These same performances were also video taped for television presentation.  One could see that these musicians were on a mission, delivering their absolute all with such commitment as to belie the fact that these same players could (and under lesser conductors probably have) sleepwalk through these warhorses.  The audience, to a person, was absolutely rapt - thoroughly transported to that sublime space that on this earth only the greatest art can accomplish.  And on CD, without that added visual input, these qualities still come through - an even rarer thing indeed.  This is NOT a recording one puts on in the background while \\"multi-tasking\\" one's way through household chores.  It deserves, COMMANDS, one's undivided attention.<br />  So PLEASE!  Buy this recording, no matter how many other recordings you may already have of these symphonies.<br />BUT...<br />Be aware that these recordings were made in the late 1970's, in Vienna's famous Musikvereinsaal.  While the live acoustics of this venue are wonderful, it is a difficult hall in which to satisfactorily record.  Recordings from there often sound dry and shrill.  Deutsche Grammophon \\"tonmeisters\\" earned notoriety, especially during this period, for producing glassy, harsh, over-miked, over-mixed horrors. At least this recording is partially redeemed by having been mastered on analog tape.  DG's digital efforts have typically been unlistenably awful, which is why to this reviewer, unless the performance is truly remarkable in some way, that bright yellow DG label may as well be a \\"Bio-Hazard\\" warning.<br />  On the other hand, other critics have said they like \\"that\\" sound. So all I can say is, \\"De gustibus non est disputandum.\\" - \\"On matters of taste there is no argument.\\" So, \\"Caveat emptor!\\" - \\"Buyer beware!\\"  But even if, like with Yours Truly, the audio quality causes one's fillings to ache, this recording is a \\"must have.\\"ly, the audio quality causes one's fillings to ache, this recording is a \\"must have.\\"
B000063S6Z|2.0|Despite the peppy, `gives you tingle,' single \\"we are all made of stars\\" that has received considerable airplay, and remixed, clubplay, the rest of this disk is sombre indeed. <BR>Skip quickly through the opening bars of all the songs and the downtempo sameness shines through. The disc is plagued by a similarity of tempo, beat and emotion. Despite his success, Moby is clearly in a reflective and somewhat sad mood. Its hard to listen all the way through without going down with him.  Possibly he has fallen under the curse of many successful artists, taking themselves too seriously and having the urge to say profound things. Once again the use of orchestration merely adds a fog of pomposity that sours the mood further. The sound is also a tard hard, synthetic, soulless. Technically clever? Of course. Mixed brilliantly? Of course. Does Moby have things to say? Yep. But listenable? Not really, and since that is what its all about (if not, write poetry see: Jewel), two stars only.  Is the party over with Moby? It seems so.
0802130208|5.0|I absolutely loved and completely enjoyed this book.  If you've heard that this book is funny, it isn't one of those laugh-a-minute books peppered with lame jokes that we've read a dozen times over in other books or heard on televisions' saddest sitcoms.  In fact, its a completely different brand of humour.  'This book sure can make me laugh.' For instance, one particular description of our unlikely hero sitting on a stool and looking like a brinjal balanced on a thumbtack made me burst out laughing whilst lining up for the bus.  But one cannot attribute all the laughs to Ignatius, but share it amongst every single one of the supporting cast.  Not a single word written by John Kennedy Toole was out of place.  His juxtaposing of choice words describing the plights in which Ignatius got himself into were works of brilliance.  It really is a pity that we will never be able to indulge ourselves in similarly wonderful books again.  We have lost a literary genius who managed to convey not just humour, but a deeper meaning concerning human behaviour and thought in his writing.  And to think I just picked this book randomly off a shelf.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is often described as Pantera's weak album. I don't see that. Sure, the production makes the quality of the music not as good as the later albums. There's a simple solution to that. Turn the volume up louder! And, it is when the volume is cranked that you will see that this album is also heavy and it is a step above some of the other albums because it has some of the best solos ever to be cranked out by Dimebag Darrell. &quot;Heresy&quot; is an awesome song, as is the title song, &quot;Domination&quot;, &quot;Message In Blood&quot;, and the incredible &quot;Cemetary Gates&quot; where you will hear Phil sing clean and clearly back when he was able to do that. Don't let those rumours of this being a weak album fool you. It's not. It's just another great Pantera album like all of them.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A buddy, affectionately known as 'That Ricky Guy,' discovered that I had never heard of Norah Jones. Well, he thought so much of this unique and gifted song stylist (and of me, for some reason) that he gifted me with a copy of this CD. I pay attention to Ricky's musical evaluations because he is the only still-living person I know who was actually there at Carnegie Hall in 1961 to witness Judy Garland's Ultimate Triumph (though he was probably on his mama's knee), and he said Norah Jones is good. He's right. He's definitely right!<br />It's human nature for us, hearing a singer for the first time, to make the inevitable comparisons....and I did just that listening to Norah. There were touches of Peggy Lee, I thought...certainly Rita Coolidge...Blossom Dearie, though the voice isn't that fragile...some of Nina Simone's subtle emotion. And of course she's a jazz singer, but there sure is a touch of country in that delivery of hers, maybe even a gentle hint of smokey coffee-house folk singers. But finally it dawns on you that Norah Jones, this young girl with a talent far older than she herself, has seduced you....reeled you right in with her OWN individual brand of musical magic.<br />Just as I didn't know Norah until this evening, many of the songs were also new to me....but I'm sure will become old friends. I especially loved &quot;One Flight Down,&quot; and the title song she wrote herself, as well as &quot;Nightingale&quot; and &quot;The Long Day Is Over.&quot; Of course my favorites were the two familiar standards, &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; and &quot;The Nearness Of You&quot; (let's face it....I'm basically stuck back there in time wanting more details of Garland's encores from my friend Rick) but I really do think Ms. Jones would be doing herself (and us) a great service if she borrowed a page from Diana Krall and recorded an entire album of the old classics. She has the genuine talent to give new life to old chestnuts...and she should!

B0000024JN|5.0|I first got this album long ago when I first put some 12&quot; subwoofers in the back of my car.

B000066NW0|3.0|The title of my review stands corrected. I do anything I can--run, jump, swim, fly, use others around me in any way to protect myself, to stay away from music of this sort. It's what they call 'pop music.' The like of Britney Spears, N*SYNC, 98 Degrees, BSB, and the latest mutants on the scene...Dream Street.<br />However, lately, the pop world has been in a buzz about three additions that are changing the genre's direction. They are: Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, and--Avril Lavigne. All use rock music and the guise of 'writing their own stuff' as a way of reflecting the 'pop' label.<br />This has slightly restored my faith in the direction of music. Branch uses an electric guitar to get this 'alternative' sound to her music. Fine. I have roots in alternative. Everything from Third Eye Blind to Pearl Jam. She fits. Carlton uses orchestral instrumentation and her piano to design complex arrangements, much like classical music. I like classical, especially the piano. \\"A Thousand Miles\\" is a great song. HOWEVER, neither of these two artists have been able to hold my attention for long, seeing as how I listen to metal, ska, punk, and most other types of rock music, much of it underground. When I heard that another pop singer arrived with roots in punk, I jumped for joy.<br />I guess I should have looked before I leaped. The music is nothing but simple, tired-out guitar licks. The lyrics are childish and not very deep, and the rhyme schemes are too odd. Avril Lavigne's voice itself, is nothing but a cheap knockoff of the great Alanis Morissette. \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" the only decidedly 'punk' song here, makes Sum41 sound like punk. That's not good. Plus, dressing up in Hot Topic clothes and wearing ties over tank tops doesn't make you a 'punk.'<br />Why 3 stars? Avril is still part of a movement to steer kids in the direction of good music, she DOES play the instrument, and the tunes she has written are not pure trash. Plus, I think she's hot...

6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead II is, I believe, one of the top 10 funniest movies ever made.  Ash is back and better than ever.  Whether its hacking off his own hand, chopping up his possesed girlfrien, or fighting the evil fat lady in the cellar, Ash does it with style and humor. <br />If you go into this movie expecting real horror you'll be disappointed.

Great comic acting, sweet camera angles, laugh out loud special effects and the greatest hero of all time make ED II one of the best of the best.<br />And yes, beer really did shoot out of my nose while watching this movie.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album marks a turning point for the Beatles.  In Rubber Soul, the group pays particular attention to its roots in American country and folk music.  Unfortunately, record company people had to fool with it and they decided to put out different versions for the U.S. and the U.K. Considering the capacity of a compact disc they should have included everything from both versions of the album, but they only put out the U.K. version so we're missing 2 songs. One of them, \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" is a terrific Liverpool-meets-Nashville creation that really clicks and has rightly been covered by many country and bluegrass artists.  Lennon &amp; McCartney do it again with \\"I'm Looking Through You\\".  Rubber Soul offers a quieter, more acoustic approach that seem downright \\"folky\\" when I hear it today. \\"It's Only Love\\", also missing on the U.K. version of this album, is an excellent example of this \\"new\\" Beatles sound. The singing is now older, wiser. Other songs on the album follow in this vein, such as \\"In My Life\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Michell\\", and \\"Girl\\".  The U.K. album has the great tunes \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\".  Another nod to country is Ringo's take on \\"What Goes On?\\"  Frankly, I think that \\"Drive My Car\\" is more of a throwback to the older Beatles sound-perhaps meant to temper things for our British cousins, but it's all for the good. If you wish to hear Rubber Soul completely you have to buy this cd plus the U.K. \\"Help\\" cd that contains the missing songs. Then, you can burn everything onto a single cd and get what we should have had in the first place.
0792844602|5.0|Some viewers, especially if they are Islamic, may find this movie daunting.  But unfortuentely they chose to view it in a political context, ..., and miss the whole point.  This movie is a stirring, if slightly dated saga of Victorian honor and duty.  It bares little resemblence to the novel by A.E.W. Mason providing as it does a lot more action and movement.  This is one of the few cases where the movie actaully comes across better than the original novel.  The Korda production provides for brilliant sets, authentic costumes and totally accurate scenery. The vast resources of the British Empire were able to provide an authentic backdrop for the production value of this movie. This is truly a classic of the old cinema.<br />As for the history, the Madhi was hardly some kindly fellow from the desert.  He was a fanatic murderer, bent upon distorting Islam for his own purposes.  ...The Madhi sought merely to remove the Anglo-Turkish influences from the region and replace it with his own religeous terror.  He managed to kill Gordon at the epic siege of Khartoum in 1885, and it took the British 10 yrs to muster the inclination to go back to the region and defeat the Mahdist movement.<br />It is interesting to point out that the fanatic swine Bin Laden was inspired by the Madhi, and no doubt sees himself as one and the same.  There is not much difference between them really.  Of course then we had the redoubtable British Empire to crush such vermin, whereas today we don't. The Mahdi's successor, The Khallifah was hardly much better.  For 10 yrs he ruined the Sudan and Ethopia with famine and war before the Britsih crushed him at Omdurman, as related in the movie.  There was no such prison break inspired by a Faversham character, nor is this shown in the book, but Korda put it in to liven up the novel which it surely does.  The prison conditions shown in the movie are accurate as to the way the Madhist treated \\"infidels\\" and other prisoners.  Make no mistake about it, neither the Madhi or Khallifah were nice men.  They were not patriots in the name of Islam, but cruel religeous leaders who killed and exploited for their own gain.  The Madhi died of sexual exhaustion in his harem after the fall of Khartoum in 1885, so much for being the pure hero of Islam.  Viewers should check out the movie \\"Khartoum\\" to get a better perspective of historical events in the Sudan during this period.<br />This is a wonderful movie which will inspire the viewer with how such pretending murderers were dealt with in Queen Victoria's time.  Enjoy.neither the Madhi or Khallifah were nice men.  They were not patriots in the name of Islam, but cruel religeous leaders who killed and exploited for their own gain.

B00005J6UR|3.0|I had remembered this movie as much better than it really is, having been a huge fan of the sequel for years.  Gremlins had a great concept, but it falls into an uncomfortable middle between children's movie and teenage comedy-horror, and the scripting and lighting are badly dated.<br />Chris Columbus script takes much of the blame for the insufferably cutesy small-townisms.  The stereotypes portrayed in this movie are pretty nasty at their core -- for example, the black high-school science teacher is so incredibly dumb that it looks like a racial statement, and the character of Mrs. Beagle, the inhumanly sadistic widow, is neither believable nor funny.  The pacing lags badly, and there is a sore lack of good dramatic scenes throughout the movie, especially in its languid second act before lead character Billy finally goes out into the town after the bad gremlins.  Zach Galligan is only mildly interesting in the lead (he would really come into life in the sequel), and Phoebe Cates is mostly window dressing, while Judge Reinhold's part was cut down to, mostly, one barroom scene and then, unfeasibly, disappears from the film entirely.<br />When this movie tries to make the gremlins a real monster threat, it doesn't work all that well.  On the other hand, Gremlins is hugely enjoyable when the gremlins are just acting like weirded-out humans.  The bar scene at Dorry's with the gremlins getting drunk and acting out is mostly hilarious (although the dated Flashdance spoof is a bit much), and the creatures look great.  Notably,Gizmo is less cutesy than he is in the second movie -- probably because the powers-that-be were trying to go for even more kid-oriented merchandising imagery in the second film.<br />While its flaws don't prevent Gremlins from being a pretty enjoyable movie overall, I felt this movie to be slow and a little thin almost two decades after I'd first seen it.  But in 1989 the sequel would turn the franchise on its head and correct every flaw -- and thensome.
B000067CPX|5.0|Lately I have heard many MANY people slinging mud at the Red Hot Chili Peppers calling them everything from \\"sellouts\\" to \\"no fun anymore\\".  While earlier outings such as \\"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" and \\"Mother's Milk\\" are what got me into the Chili Peppers in the first place, if they were still trying to churn out the same exact funk-punk that they did in the 80's I am certain I'd be bored to tears with them by now.  I relish the fact that no two Chili Peppers albums really sound the same, and even appreciate the greatly panned \\"One Hot Minute\\" for its own unique style (I certainly wouldn't have minded hearing a second album with Navarro on guitar before he took off).  As far as them being sellouts...whatever.  I used to be one of those brainless sheep that called every band with a hit single \\"sellouts\\" until I read Henry Rollins's \\"Get in the Van,\\" where he said that Black Flag were considered sellouts for (among other things) cutting their hair, not playing every single song the audience requested, playing songs that were longer than 3 minutes, and...horror of horrors...RELEASING ALBUMS.  People who accuse bands of selling out should be taken every bit as seriously as an Anna Nicole Smith film festival.<BR>This album, while maybe not as close to the typical idea of \\"fun\\" as albums where the boys rapped about sex and partying, is indeed a treasure.  I'll admit I wasn't too crazy about it at first, but upon repeated listenings I found myself unable to listen to anything else for weeks.  My personal favorites are the block of \\"This is the Place,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me.\\"  Other gems include the Living Colour-esque \\"Midnight\\" (seriously, imagine Corey Glover singing the chorus), the Latin-flavored \\"Cabron\\", the irresistably bouncy \\"On Mercury\\", and of course the two singles \\"By the Way\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song.\\"  The only thing about this album that I was a bit upset about is the fact that Flea's bass gymnastics have completely taken a back seat this time around.  His contributions are much more subtle than on previous records and his breathtaking slaps and pops are sorely missed.  This is an Anthony and John album all the way.  But on the plus side...this is an Anthony and John album all the way!  Anyone who's heard and enjoyed John's stunning 2000 solo effort \\"To Record Only Water For Ten Days\\" (easily one of the best albums of that year) knows what an unrivaled genius John is now that he's said good riddance to heroin.  His sublime guitar play and experimental synth work snake their way all over this album in the aforementioned tracks and others such as \\"Warm Tape,\\" \\"Venice Queen,\\" and \\"Tear.\\" <BR>No fun anymore?  I suppose that all depends on your idea of fun.  If you're looking for something to blast at your next house party amidst kegstands and random hook-ups, look elsewhere.  By the Way affects you in a much different way, but is by no means boring or not fun.  Pick it up and listen to it at least twice before you pass judgment.
B000067FP8|5.0|The relative financial failure of Gremlins 2:  The New Batch in its theatrical run was one of the gross injustices of late-'80s, early-'90s cinema.  Gremlins 2 is superior to the first in every single way -- richer, funnier, faster-moving, better lit and shot, far better acted, and the script by Charlie Haas is light years ahead of its clumsy Chris Columbus-scripted predecessor. <br />Gremlins 2 gets my vote for best sequel of all time.  While The Godfather, Part II, Terminator 2 and The Empire Strikes Back tend to lead that poll, all these previous entries had pretty strong predecessors.  On the other hand, Gremlins, the original film, was an interesting and sometimes funny little film, but Gremlins 2 really improved on every front and came up with something nobody has ever seen before.<br />Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are ten times more interesting in the sequel than in the original, probably thanks to the script.  As a condition for director Joe Dante committing to do the sequel the studio had given him full control of the content, and Dante and writer Haas do a tremendous job in weaving this zany world together, which is like Die Hard meets Dawn of the Dead meets Gremlins.  The comedic elements are definitely superior, and the concept of giving each gremlin a distinct personality is immediately winning, the &quot;brain&quot; gremlin and the crazy loose-cannon gremlin being especially hilarious.  (Phoebe Cates' interactions with the loose-cannon gremlin are just priceless.)  The film is ripe with satirical ideas and populated with highly charming characters.  In the first Gremlins, the &quot;bad&quot; characters are simply bad without much humanity to them.  Here, all the &quot;villainous&quot; characters are given their share of complexity, right down to the riotous ending.<br />Again, it is baffling to me that the first film, interesting at best and clunky at worst, was a huge box-office hit while this superlative sequel literally ended the franchise.  (Dante had said in an interview that the studio, not believing in the film, had opened Gremlins 2 against Dick Tracy in an effort to undermine Warren Beatty's film, thus damaging Gremlins 2's theatrical take.)  But that's what video and DVD are for, and if you've never seen this film, it's definitely a winner.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is (in my view) single greatest mini-series ever produced.  I was captivated by every episode and the details within.  So much so that I read the book by Stephen Ambrose.  The book, which is a great read, is translated closer then any text I've ever encountered (three cheers to Dreamworks/Playtone).  I even aplauded the use of David Schwimmer, who I find to be one of the worst actors in all Hollywood, a superior choice in the role of Capt. Herbert Sobel.  <br />If one is to invest in DVD as a collectible item then this is one that belongs in every collection.  I hope this story of extraordinary human accomplishment is passed down for all generations as something to strive for.  I know when watching this program it made me feel like a hero and want to accmplish heroic deeds.  Make sure you get and/or watch this when released.
B000063DIR|1.0|Ozzy... what the hell was he thinking???  This is one of the two greatest rock albums ever brought to being by the great OZ (the second being Blizzard).  I bought this one on vinyl the day it was released &amp; fell in love with the way it was recorded and mixed.  UNFORTUNATELY, this is not the same recording &amp; should be avoided at all costs.  PLEASE believe all of the negative reviews!!  The music is different, the bass lines are terrible, and the drumming is so off time, its amazing they kept the tracks.  I'm not an engineer, just an average music fan who really likes Ozzy.  Do yourself a favor and miss this one.
B0000028RR|5.0|Man, this is a great album.  I have had it since I was in middle school and I still jam to it almost everyday.  This is when Rage was really [angry] and it shows.  Songs like \\"Killing In the Name\\" and \\"Bombtrack\\" show off Zack's fury at the fullest.  Every song on this album is a masterpiece, it is impossible to pick a favorate.  Everybody play's at their fullest, Brad's drumming is very interesting and creative, Timmy's Bass is funky and has many hidden fills, Mr. Morello was just as weird and inventive with some of the strangest effects I have every heard, and Zack perfectly releases his anger with a combination of rap and punk-like vocals.  All in all, I really wish they still made them like this, if you haven't heard this yet you really should check it out and give it a chance.

B000068G9X|4.0|This is the 1st Danzig lp with the \\"new\\" name. Taking <BR>Eerie Von from Samhain, John Christ on guitar- who made <BR>a guest appearance on Samhain's finale \\"Final Descent\\",<BR>Chuck Biscuits formerly of Black Flag, Circle Jerks, and<BR>other seminal punk act;on drums and of course ol' Glenn himself<BR>on vox. THis is a different sound for Glenn seeing as<BR>Glenn made a career out of horror-punk. While the subject<BR>matter stays true to form- the music takes on a classic<BR>metal/rock approach. Crossing over to the 70's metal of <BR>Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin while mantaining  simplicity<BR>in riffing and arrangments. There's plenty of guitar noodling<BR>courtesy of John Christ who unlike players from Glenn's past<BR>is more than just competent at his instrument. Chuck also<BR>fine tunes the rhythm section while Chuck isn't playing thrash<BR>drum lines he shows more than once he has chops more so than previous<BR>drummers of Danzig. What about the vocals you ask?<BR>Well- they are still pretty true to form of Glenn sounding at<BR>times more like Morrison than ever. Most people will get this <BR>because Danzig's top 40 track \\"Mother\\" is on here. But there are <BR>some other killer songs: \\"TWist of Caine\\", \\"End Of Time\\" so forth. Perhaps the track that sticks out the most is \\"Possession\\"<BR>which sounds like Samhain could've easily done the song.(And they did I come to find out!) Are there things that bother me about this release? Yeah the guitar could use a little more gain at times it sounds like John is using the clean channel and just <BR>decided to crank the gain instead hitting overdrive. John distortion is your freind! Otherwise this is worth picking up.
B000068OSK|5.0|And I thought they were just another Indy-Wanna-Be-New Wave Band!But don't judge this book by it's cover.Which is what I did. I took one look at their get-up and thought they were some pathetic gimmick band. Then I heard the music. I had no idea that they'd be covering such Blues classics as \\"Stop Breaking Down\\". And that's what they essentially are: a modern Punk/Blues band. And I love the sparseness. Just some killer electric guitar and percussion. Jack White is raw as hell on on the ol' six strings and he sings like Robert Plant wanting to Be Iggy Pop, whilst fumbling with this time worn legacy called The Blues. And I'm talking those Delta \\"purist\\" Blues not some B.B. King Burger King Ad stuff. He's riffing off acoustic John Lee Hooker and Son House. The end result is a fresh sound and whether they're married or divorced (or brother and sister), Jack and Meg White have created a unique sound out of solid traditon. Ballads like \\"Suzy Lee\\" are brilliantly placed among workouts like, \\"Astro\\", where he comes off like James Brown with one foot on fire.<br />Look there's alot of Indy Bands out there and I'm 30-odd year old Blues fan talking here. The WHITE STRIPES are, for once, more than meets the eye.
6305212112|5.0|I watched this after a few years, and was taken in, totally, all over again. Jon Avnet's debut as director is certainly admirable, as are the well received performances of Kathy Bates &amp; Jessica Tandy. Fannie Flagg's novel provided a perfect opportunity for some great female performances. The Oscar nominated screenplay of Ms. Flagg &amp; Carol Sobieski only lost the Oscar because it was up against another Woman-driven script, &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (which won). How often will that happen again? The real driving forces in this film  are the performances of Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker (unappreciated, both, with a respectable body of work behind them)  Chris O'Donnell, just before  his remarkable performance in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, made a big impression. It seems strange to me that I remember Lesbian overtones from the press about this film and, though, understandable, I don't know why friendship films like &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; or &quot;Thelma&quot; or the original Oscar-winner &quot;Wings&quot; never got that buzz. People in love, even platonically, should be applauded. There's not enough love out there, lately...
B000068PQ7|5.0|If you want my consumer advice, get this before it reaches the \\"limited availablity\\" status of NO OTHER. Though more laid back in terms of production, WHITE LIGHT remains one of Gene Clark's most signifigant releases. If you're into Graham Parsons, Townes Van Zandt or Neil Young, Gene Clark's right up your alley. As his work with the Byrds goes to show, he had the uncanny ability to write a great pop melody, off-set by an inescapable sense of longing and melancholy. In a way, he's a bit like a country-fied Nick Drake. Much like Drake and the very early Tom Waits, he seems to have strived to establish a particular mood in his solo work. A kind of opiate feel, complimented by a set of baroquely reflective lyrics. The end result is an album of slow burning intensity. \\"Spanish Guitar\\" is a prime example, a song Dylan professed a great admiration for. Another gem is \\"With Tomorrow\\" with the haunting opening line, \\"it was more like a dream than reality\\"---a phrase that perfectly captures the tone of this album.<br />The bonus tracks are a real plus. \\"Opening Day\\" is particularly notable and one couldn't ask for a better closer with, \\"Winter In\\". Like so many songs on this album, it's guilty of infectiously lazy hooks and baffling, evocative verse.<br />Though released at the height of the Hippie Era, Clark was a shade or two darker than his contemporaries. All of which may account for his lack of commercial appeal. Sure, he should have been huge, but in the end what can you do but write a good review some 30 years later? Fortunately, the music's still around and currently gaining rapid cult status thanks to a roster of fickle critics, and a few hard working musicians who took the time out to drop his name.<br />Still it's a shame NO OTHER is available only on import while Clark's last full-length solo album languishes out of print. In lieu of the compilation FLYING HIGH and the tribute, FULL CIRCLE, I would heartily recommend WHITE LIGHT and THE FANTASTIC EXPEDITION OF DILLARD & CLARK instead. Not to mention the desperately epic, NO OTHER. That should be enough to make you cross your fingers for the eventual reissue of this album I keep hearing about. I'm not sure of the title, but I think it's called,TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY.DILLARD & CLARK instead. Not to mention the desperately epic, NO OTHER.

B00005Y7AW|4.0|Although not quite as sound as his debut album, &quot;Poses&quot; is definitely a cd that remains in my stereo for long periods of time.  My personal favorites are &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot;, &quot;Consort&quot;, and &quot;Tower of Learning&quot;.  I fell in love with &quot;Poses&quot; before his self-titled debut, so even though &quot;Rufus Wainwright&quot; continues to be my favorite (and maybe overall favorite cd), &quot;Poses&quot; will always hold a special place in my musical cache.  This stuff is great to listen to at any time, and somehow elevates the world around you as you listen.  Buy it...and give it two or three run throughs before you make up your mind.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Unfortunately, two stars is all that I can give it.  I sooo wanted to like this movie.  I have never read the HG Wells book, The Time Machine, so I had no worries about being disappointed with the story matching up.  I was fully prepared to take the movie on its own terms.  I have to report, though, that those terms were quite thin.  <br />I found much in this movie fully implausable, leaving me with more questions than answers.  Like: Why would the morlocks sneak into the village, steal the watch, and not take the child or someone else to eat?  Why did the Uber Morlock want to let the professor go?  What was the machine that all of the morlocks were trying to keep going underground?  Where did the virtual librarian get the power to continue running 800,000 years into the future?<br />The movie was visually stunning, the extras on the DVD are nice, and the acting was decent.  Sadly, it seems, like so many other movies of our time, that good looks is all that The Time Machine had going for it.
B000067FP8|5.0|I really liked this movie when I saw it in 1990.  I almost skipped it because I had found the first one only so-so.  But it's a lot of fun.  The DVD release is a pretty sterling transfer considering it's 12 years old.  If I had to pick between one and two, I'd go for two.
B000002J1F|5.0|This has Yes most familiar song Roundabout. It also has Lond Distance Run around. What's also good about the cd is songs like mood for a day( a classic accoustic guitar work), heart of the sunrise , and south side of the sky( which is as close to heavy metal as they get.
B000002H2H|5.0|Contrary to just about everyone else saying \\"Master of Puppets\\" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt \\"Ride the Lightning\\" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is \\"Fade to Black\\", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  \\"Escape\\" is hte only song that could be classified as \\"filler material\\", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is \\"Creeping Death\\", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental \\"Call of Ktulu\\" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.
0812550706|5.0|There's no way someone would not be atracted by this book. I had never read anything by Orson Scott Card and now I'm looking for almost everything he's written.<br />&quot;Ender's game&quot; is the story of a boy, who is possibly Man's last hope. In a long war against a not well known adversary, the insect-like &quot;buggers&quot;, Ender Wiggin, a six year old child, is taken to the Battle School to learn the tricks that maybe will lead humanity to its survival. He can have no friends, no grown-up will be there to help him in his personal struggles against older boys filled with envy, he's taken from his family and his beloved sister... This could be a terrible life, but Ender's sense of responsibility always drags him back to his supposed duty.<br />Orson Scott Card was able to create a sci-fi story in the middle of a, let's say, story of a life. The reader will always stay with Ender (except in the chapters when we are told Ender's brothers lives, but that helps to understand his relations to his family and some of what happens to him when he's away in Battle School, and some of what happens near the end of the book); we will see him become a master of military strategy, and we will see him abandon everything he holds dear in order to achieve a greater feat.<br />There were parts of &quot;Ender's game&quot; that reminded me of other books, such as &quot;Lord of the flies&quot;, &quot;Starship troopers&quot;, and some others, and I think that's a high compliment.<br />This is not your common sci-fi book, it is something much more subtle and has many levels of meanings, but can be read just as a good entertainment, so enjoy.<br />Grade 9.5/10
B00005K3OT|4.0|Here is a movie that, in a just world, should have won best picture. Alas, we live in a cynical and spiritually impoverished world. For all of its sentimentalism and flaws, I have fallen in love with the irreverent heart of &quot;Chocolat.&quot;<br />I knew I'd probably like this movie even before I saw it. Three of its stars: Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and Johnny Depp all have a talent for picking projects that I end up liking. They do not disappoint here. Binoche shines, Dench grouses her way into the viewer's heart, and Depp is his usual personable self.<br />The unexpected gems (acting-wise) here are: Molina--who steals this film as the uptight Comte; Carrie-Anne Moss--as stunning a beauty as I have seen..who manages to hit just the right mixture of restraint and empathy; and Lena Olin--whose character undergoes one of the most wonderfully hopeful transformations in the movie (she brings it off flawlessly).<br />I love how this movie gives the lie to empty, external, even religious moralism. The message of &quot;don't&quot; and &quot;no&quot; has never done anything but twist the soul of humanity. The resolution of this wonderful fable, particularly Pere Henri's final speech presents us with something truly inspiring to think on.<br />Exclusion always pales before embrace, Love conquers judgment, and a light shines in the darkness.<br />The DVD special features are outstanding for a single disc. I particularly enjoy the stirring of Chocolate effect while they load.<br />I give this movie my full recommendation.
