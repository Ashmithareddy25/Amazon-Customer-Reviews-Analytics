B00GWBR6BM|5|Would highly recommend for women without live in Jackson. I use them and it really works and plump sure lips up very nicely. Contacted customer service for a particular reason and she was extremely courteous and very prompt and her response. Overall hundred percent satisfied and highly recommend the seller and the product
B004Y4JNZ6|5|This is a great product that does not clump.  Goes on smooth.  And does not flake off.  Key for a contact wearer like myself!
B0040QZU64|5|Got this for my dad for Christmas. Too good to be true.. But it is NOT a knockoff. This is the real thing.....
B004R6CAGU|5|I love both this and the Skin79 Pink bottle. I really didn't see much of a difference in color or coverage; I buy them pretty much interchangeably. If I run completely out in between bottles for a while, my skin definitely can tell the difference. I wear this every day as my foundation - I will be a lifetime customer. I usually order from SeoulGlamour, which is a GREAT shipper, but their shop was down when I made this purchase. This shipper (Pink Gelee out of California) was great, as well. I was a little worried having it not come from Korea itself, but it was 100% authentic and as great as ever.
B009W4D64C|1|Cheaply made.
B00132TISE|5|Great product! Really cheap. Lots of functions. Worth the price! Really neeeded a new hair straightner and this one is one of the best!
B000E3FHR4|5|Love this soap.  It is a shame that Sprouts quit carrying it.
B00R5HQABO|4|Wonderful green fragrance Hyde Park like most Hugh Parsons fragrances deserve to be better known, but probably won't be.  Too bad.
B000TKF15A|5|I totally love this shampoo.  I have been using for over a month now.  my hair is never frizzy or dry.  Always feels smooth and full of body.  I don't think I have had a bad hair day since.  I color my hair and if definitely seems like the color holds better.  I am recommending it to all of my friends.
B002OIIF30|1|ok
B0052BHMOE|5|Great product, using for extra volume for the lazy days and free from teasing your hair. Would recommend to other girls who likes they hair being volumized
B002HM1ONG|1|This is a huge and heavy comb. So unless you really have huge unruly hair, you wouldn't need this. The comb is really two combs stuck together. Its too big for me.
B001E768CC|5|I have very fair skin.  I've worn sunscreen for the past 25 years.  I feel I have pretty good experience when it comes to sunscreen.  This is hands down the best sunscreen I have ever used.  I mix it with a little Marula Oil and my skin looks amazing.  I don't wear powder or foundation so I can't speak to how it works with either of those products.<br /><br />It spreads nicely without any type of sunscreen residue.<br /><br />It also has an extremely low toxicity rating on the EWG website.
B000VONAJI|5|MY FAV IS THE ORIGINAL LAGERFELD  BUT FOR A CHANGE ONCE IN A WHILE PHOTO IS HOT<br />GREAT GREAT GREAT,
B003UKM90Q|5|Great Product, would be from seller again!
B006R5GXCG|4|ok
B00P9HXHAE|5|Very comfy. Fit nicely & look great.
B0013ND45G|4|I love the color! It came out a brilliant fuschia even on my hard to dye hair. This is the second time I have used it. The color lasted for about two months, slowly fading along the way. My only complaint about this dye is that it really drys out my hair. I have been using extra conditioner and a conditioning mousse and that does seem to help.<br /><br />Be prepared for very bright color!
B00470L8XW|5|This is The Best stuff. Non greasy, Good Smelling All Body ageing protector. I use it also as aftershave.
B002F3RDZK|5|After I discovered this color shadow had probably been discontinued (I could never find it in stores any more), I was happy to see that Amazon could still get it for me. Love the color, shimmer and it lasts forever. My favorite shadow for many years.
B005MMDC5G|2|First time I've had a problem.  Powder pack and mirror fell out.  Hopefully isolated incident as it's the only thing that's helped.
B009IS1SWY|5|it works great
B0096UEDLM|5|This product is AMAZING! I have tried most every toning shampoo, conditioner, or treatment out there and this is by far the best, Most of the others don't seem to have a potent enough strength of the purple/blue color to make much of a difference. You don't even have to use much of the product to totally coat the hair enough to tone the yellow/orange color out of blonde. I pretty much just use it every two weeks to keep the brassiness away from my blonde color and when I first went blonde and more significant brassiness I wanted to tone out there was an immediate difference after the first use. I will never switch to another product since I've found this. Yes it's a bit pricier for a smaller size bottle. But you use MUCH less of it much less often and see results after the FIRST use. So basically it's a MUCH BETTER DEAL than all those bigger bottles that cost less and are not nearly as strong in color; And also the other toning products seemed very drying to my hair and this one actually makes my hair super soft and conditioned.
B007TVB17E|3|the bottle is not as nicely made as a few years back....It must come from China!!
B00TSTZQEY|4|My only complaint is the dropper was placed in the box first then the bottle of oil put on top, it  broke the dropper 😒.  Be nice if they put bubble wrap around the dropper.  Be nice if they would send me a new one!
B0043OYH44|4|Stop wasting money on expensive high end foundations that over promise and under deliver.  I've spent hundreds of dollars on high end foundations such as Jane Iredale, Clinique, Lancome and Shiseido just to name a few.  By chance, I happened to get a free sample of COVERGIRL NatureLuxe and I am simply amazed that a product that cost so little can work so well.      Within a few days of using the sample, several friends and co-workers told me I looked really good and asked me what I was doing different.  At first I didn't realize what they were seeing, but then I realized that it was the foundation that was making me look younger.      No more dry look from mineral foundations, or creases from age enhancing liquid foundations.  COVERGIRL NatureLuxe is so light, it doesn't feel like you are wearing makeup at all, yet is smooth out your complexion beautifully.  I'm no longer too proud to lower myself to purchasing make up from a drug store because this foundation is fabulous.
B003FBRST2|5|I have been using this product for approximately 4 years, and have never looked back. I had tried a lot of lip glosses that left my lips feeling sticky and icky! Most, not only felt cheap, but had odors which I did not like.<br />Neutrogena, feels just right,  no odor or sticky feel. I also like that there is a color to match my every mood, and I can mix the colors or wear over my lipstick to soften the look.<br />Great product!
B001G7PWAE|5|Great product.  Nice quality; not cheaply made like some other brands. Size was correct whereas other brands that i tried were too small for a man's hand.<br />Received them the next day.
B00B43DHG6|1|Smells bad. I brought the other night queen on amazon too. The Arabic one and it smells bad too. And it is dark. Does not look like the picture.
B002L9SZLO|5|Sharp case with various sized rollers that can be packed easily.<br />It heats up fine and does a nice job curling the<br />hair for easy, fast styling.
B003983I1S|5|I tried this product because it was part of a promotional TRY-ME campaign run by Gillette. I received a razor and blades free via snail mail. I had been stalking the mail man for several days anticipating the arrival of this magnificent device.<br /><br />I am hooked on this razor & the blades. I have never had a closer, smoother shave with another product. My face felt smoother than a baby's bottom after my first shave, and with several shaves after that. I experienced no nicks or cuts that I do with other well-known shaving systems. That's good since my wife is a vampire! With other shaving systems, I was fearful to shave while she was near.<br /><br />I will be recommending these blades and razor to every guy I know.
B00K5JGTSI|5|This stuff actually works!  I was just brushing my curls aside when I saw this reminder from Amazon to review the product.  I still had to use a few drops of Morrocan Oil to get the comb through, but when I did, the curls were there.
B000BIUGSM|4|Great product! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a flexible hold when styling!
B00EYMWQRA|5|The absolute best lotion around.<br />Smells great. No oily feeling.
B00BX9GLF0|4|This product was just as described.<br />The volume for each product was excellent for this price.<br />This was given as a gift and was very much enjoyed.
B001CS96GI|5|I absolutely love this scent. I am very picky about perfumes, but this is definitely my favorite. Everytime I wear it I have people stop me, or follow me to tell me that I smell amazing. I would say it's a light scent like \\"Happy\\", but so much better, addicting in a way. Funny, I am even hesitant to tell people/friends about it b/c I don't want everyone buying it. A keeper for sure. Believe me, you will NOT be disappointed. Also, I am huge fan of Benefit. Started out trying their \\"Boi ing\\" concealer about 2 years ago and now I think have all of their bestselling stuff.
B00BPX88TG|5|You can spend a ton of money for mascara, but nothing in my opinion is better than this mascara.  It lengthens, shines and makes your lashes look long and luxurious.  I've been through about 5 tubes of this and wouldn't use anything but this.  Doesn't clump, separates your lashes perfectly and you can layer it and use a curler and it holds a curl like crazy.  Won't smear all over your lower lids either.  If you like your lashes to be separate and shiny... this is the stuff.<br /><br />I believe the company has discontinued this, so buy it if you like it.  I'm buying 7 to make sure I don't run out.
B00AE07CTI|4|Found it good in that it put away the dandruff but somehow the hairfall persists
B0075P0WW4|5|Just what the bald head order, on my third foil with my Wahl. Works as good as the original, even better .It came with blades also.
B003FBJFB6|5|Eco tools Body Mist For Change is a soothing cologne that doesn't dominate your senses but gives you a pleasant smell that is good for all occassions.
B000HHOK9S|5|Same product I would've gotten at the BE boutique. There was some complaints about how some people got the &#34;sample size&#34;, but I got a normal, full size that I would purchase from the store. I'm very pleased.
B001VD95II|4|Very smooth powder.. Very pretty purple .. Purple formula has changed from a few years ago when I bought this before
B000HRVC5I|1|Its a fake!!!!! The packaging is correct but the sponge feels different than the original. Buyers beware!!
B00006IVEQ|4|I recently bought this product. The price is competitive. I tried it only once till now and it did it's job very well. I'll find out more as i start using it regularly.
B003YJ8ZX8|1|I bought this shaver in july from a big box store because I wanted something faster and easier than blades since I started a new job that required me to shave every day.<br /><br />The device seemed nice and ran well.<br /><br />Shave quality- ehh, not amazing. I knew it wouldnt be AS GOOD as a blade but it just did not seem to pick up the hair as well as my old rotary shaver I have had for a long time but never really used a lot. I will grant that this braun was more comfortable to shave with but that doesn't help much when it doesn't grab all the hair well. So it lost some of its score here.<br /><br />Cleaning system- I thought this was going to be the best thing ever... yeahNO. The cleaning fluid smells like rancid lemoncello and it costs $5-8 a month... plus if you spill it anywhere it will take a long time to clean up since it has a mix of oils in it. Functionally it works well but for the cost, smell, and potential mess it is not worth it IMHO. Again some of the score came off from here.<br /><br />Now to the main issues that have caused me to rank this so low and put it in the backup/travel pile.<br /><br />After just over three months (and by just over I mean a day or 2) the bezel/head cassette holder/what ever you wish to call it that holds all the foils and blades in cracked vertically on one of the long sides. I never dropped the unit and i only lightly tapped it out like you are supposed to do. I called customer service and after a round about discussion I was in formed that it would be covered under warranty as per the manufacturer date code (I had lost the original receipt in a move). Ok great... so what am i supposed to do for 2-3 weeks while it is being fixed? Luckily braun sent me a cheap battery operated razor, great... then they told me it would take 2-3 weeks to get it... really? Luckily it came in just a few days. Ok so up to this point while i am mad the unit broke they are taking good care of me (the one they sent me is as good as could be expected for a free unit). So I ship off the broken unit on my dime (insured) and wait, then I get a call from their service center telling me I owe them 36 bucks, 26 for parts and 10 for shipping... I told the lady customer service said it was covered under warranty, she replied that the parts that broke are not covered under warranty regardless of how new the unit is. So its back to customer service. I call and spend the last 20 mins of my lunch break fighting with a CS rep to get them to cover the repair they told me 10 days ago would be covered. I finally get her to cover it... but they will only cover the parts not the shipping (and I have to contact the service center and give them a code for this instead of them taking care of it in the back end). My lunch break ends before I can resolve it any more and have to call back the next day. The next call takes me 40 mins, I fight back and forth with the rep and finally get them to cover the shipping too... but I have to pay it first then fax them the invoice and wait 2-3 weeks to get the money refunded to my card. I ask for a supervisor which gives me no more help and frankly just seems like he doesn't care.<br /><br />Frankly I am rather disappointed with a)that the razor was not as good as was expected in the first place, b)that the maintenance cost of just the cleaning fluid is as much if not more than blades would be, c)that it doesnt save me any time, d)that the unit broke so quickly, e)that customer service doesnt seem to have any ability to agree with itself, f)that I am the one that has to be the communication between CS and service, and g) that I have to jump through so many hoops just to get it taken care of.<br /><br />I highly suggest you avoid this product and maybe even braun as a whole after seeing how bad CS is there. Stick to blades.
B00TTUTRJC|5|Wow!  I honestly love  this conditioner!! I use a little as a leave in as well. Fantastic product and a great find!
B002CT7C12|5|I normally can't wear Calvin Klein perfumes because they give me a headache, but this one didnt go that and I love this fragrance.
B008VID92O|5|removes mosture from my hearing aids
B008Y4OWXK|5|Works great and good aspect is the ability to renew.  So if you are disappointed at first you can go on to good results.
B005PYWS60|5|Love it..
B003CTTZQQ|1|JBCO was recommended to me by a friend who had used it and had great results.  I ordered the product and immediately began using it.  At first I thought it was great because it made my hair soft and moisturized (I was about eight months into my natural hair journey). About a week after using it, I noticed shedding but I thought it was due to it being Summer (my hair dries out in the Summer months).  I continued to use it, ignoring the warnings.  About a month later most of my hair had come out on the sides and in the back.  I eventually had to chop my hair off because it was so uneven and damaged.  After I stopped using it, the shedding stopped. My sister used the product and the same thing happened to her hair.  We didn't put the two together until it it was too late. It may work for some but unfortunately it didn't work for me.
B00M1WNKN4|3|sponges need a bit more density, otherwise they work great
B005HYLSB4|5|No peeling but burns when applying.  I am very fair skinned and must have a tolerance for this peel.  Skin looks great.
B00ANR2AM6|5|Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful product. Nourishing, hydrating, protecting, and with a lovely natural taste and scent from essential oils and honey. So far, I can only find these on Amazon. Please carry them here forever!
B008VWE71M|5|First off, since this is a Muscletech product that ensures you this is a top of the line product.<br />I recommend this product to anyone looking to bulk up and get bigger with fast strength increases.<br />I have taken lots of different creatine supplements and this one hands down is the best one I've ever had, with the greatest results.<br />People are always skeptical once they see creatine but taken this while be responsible and drinking a lot of water will have you with all the benefits it brings and nothing negative.<br />People that are familiar with other supplement companies knows Muscletech is one of the priciest,but not on Amazon!<br />Buying this and other Muscletech products on Amazon will have you saving a tremendous amount of money while looking better than the rest!
B00H1NWX8Q|4|I just got mine and its good so far!
B002AMUID0|5|I originally bought this product as a more mild soap for my husband.  He gets dry skin and was using a harsh men's body wash.  He switched to this and his dry skin was greatly reduced.  The smell isn't femanine nor is it particularly manly, I am able to use the soap without feeling like I smell like a man.
B000G33KEO|5|It is the only treatment that I have found that keeps my nails from breaking and flaking.  It must be applied as a basecoat to be effective and it can be used as a top coat as well.
B0026IMJ8A|2|I was shocked about how small it was when I got it. I got this product to mix with my foundation I have to use a lot of product to get it as pale as needed. And there isn't a lot of product any way
B000XE5260|5|Smell is awesome!
B00006FRW7|5|I bought this face lotion for my boyfriend and while that he uses it to his guy friends, he loves it.  I know whenever he is using it because he lets out this kind of happy sigh and when I tease him about it he says &#34;but it just feels so good&#34;.  His skin is clearer than it use to be and his razor burn is less frequent and severe.  I also love the lotion but wish it had some spf.
B000PUU8K2|3|I've been used this product for about three weeks now and I could noticed that my eyes looks brighter and more hydrated and even my \\"terrible\\" dark circles has diminished but I think that I am gonna use the whole jar and maybe I will have a better opinion about it!!
B00LC3YWBW|5|Gave these to the moms in my life for mothers day - very nice file with case - seems very durable and pretty.
B000KKC6DY|3|I was hoping this would be a semipermanant color like the over the counter stay-put lipcolors, but its not.  The color is nice, and it feels good, but I have to reapply regularly.
B000XDXOTI|1|Love the perfume but it can't broken in package
B00L3UE32W|1|cheap and very flimsy comb/brush combo; it's worth the money to find a better quality item. the other wide brushes and bowl are ok.
B004BD8QEO|4|mostly ok, except the standalone razer was missing the power indicator meter on the butt of the handle
B00JITDVCI|5|very good
B002DOO1VA|5|Bought these brushes in December 2010. I was pondering whether I was gonna write a review or not, but I've had them three months now and i ABSOLUTELY love them!! So I feel I should give credit where it's due! When I first got them, yes they had a weird stench on them like the other customers are saying, but it was not as bad as people made it seem. I just left the pouch open for a day or two (so they would catch some air), prewashed the brushes (with baby shampoo and Brush Cleaner) and they were good to go! I didn't have any shedding or stiffening of my brushes like others have said! The bristles are really full and soft and the quality is nice. No two brushes are exactly the same, although they may be similar, but you can tell the difference. I have washed the full set of 24brushes approximately 3-5times already and they have maintained the same quality since I bought them. This is my 3rd brush set (but first set of more than 6brushes), so I've seen and used a few others, but this set is really good thus far! It may not be the MAC brand that I usually buy but this set is REALLY good for this low-low price and it does the SAME job.... I TOTALLY recommend!
B00TSTZQEY|5|Love the smell, I use it everyday and the quality of the oil is superb.
B003Z2N30E|5|I have been using the Catwalk curl boosters for a couple years.  I am very satisfied with the results.  I have fine, curly, colored hair and in the heavy humidity of my town,  it would all turn to frizz if I didn't use the curls rock booster after shampooing.  It promotes the curls, dampens the frizz, and the curls last from shampoo to shampoo.  I'm completely sold on these catwalk products for curly hair.  Good stuff!
B00F5KDD0Y|3|I received 2 of these and one came broken but it is cute!
B006R1LBJA|5|It's great and fast shipping!
B000C21B1S|5|Believe it or not, I've been \\"wearing\\" this perfume for years.  And I<br />could not find it.  There is no other men's fragrance around and I'm a<br />woman and I LOVE IT!!!!!  Cool, refreshing, not cloying or spicy. Just<br />fantastic!  I'm glad I finally found it.  Try it, whoever reads this,<br />it is GREAT!!!!! A \\"true\\" Christmas gift.
B00IYTPSLA|5|Good smelling soap. Does the job for me!
B00MSZNVYM|5|Great product
B003ABZZKG|3|Like I said...its okay.  I wasn't overly impressed with it.  After rinsing it out I wasn't all that impressed with my hair texture.  Its okay and since I only paid 7 bucks it was worth it.
B001E4X43Q|5|I have been using English Leather Black for over 3 years.  First got it in a small size as part of a multi-pack of several colognes and loved it.  Went on line through Amazon and found the 3.4 oz size and ordered and have purchased again each year.  Highly recommend it.  Definitely different from regular English Leather.
B005MMDQ2K|1|Arrived all crumbled up
B00JTG9M4G|1|The pictures showed so many fun pieces like eyelashes fun mascaras so many things I was so excited to get when I receive the product I got about 30 lipsticks a couple of cheap eyeliners and it was absolutely heartbreaking because I got nothing in the pictures I hope that they will reach out to me and provide me with what the picture shows I would like to still order from them but it needs to be made right I'm still completely heartbroken
B006RJREUM|5|Love this product just wish I could buy them individually.
B00PATJXFE|4|The whole point of this product is a body wash that has the floral fragrance that it promises, that will last longer than most other body washes.<br />One can hardly complain about a heavier than normal floral scent when that is exactly what the product description claims. And that is what it delivers.<br /><br />One star taken away for the unnecessary colorants, and a slight 'plastic' smell that is lurking just under the floral and amber notes.<br />Slick, sexy packaging and lush scent make this a nice fit an often forgotten demographic...the mature woman that is as sensual and lush as the product packaging.  Black fishnet over red roses make for a rather provocative label on this body wash.<br />This is for the confident woman with a knowing smile, not a giggling girl. This is red dress and black stilettos.
B00GIX4M2U|2|doesnt work
B008X7D4CS|4|Love the product as always. It got here a day early which is great but the only thing is that I did not get the same size item as it is shown in the picture. I still got a big size but it wasn't the largest quantity that is shown in the picture. My only complaint is that the picture of the product is very misleading so please change that so others like myself don't order a product exactly as shown and receive something different.
B008PEMBNC|4|I bought this to replace an older unit that would no longer hold a charge. I love the timer feature. My only complaint is that sometimes the low battery indicator comes on rather late. I will call their support line the next time it happens.
B00O14R17Q|5|I love it. It works fast
B0009QZYO2|1|I didn't find a difference between using this compared to the off brand that Sally's sells.
B000VOHR88|5|I quite like this spicy/aromatic fragrance. It is so light that I can spray it on like body mist. Yes, I'm granny age to some reviewers, and I'm madly in love with Ed Hardy fragrances, so age is no indication of taste, nyah. I was glad to get this fragrance.
B0041T2ZNQ|4|Quieter than my last Panasonic but misses more. Have to go back over same spots.
B00COX5UPQ|4|smells great
B002BXBQQQ|5|I use these every day almost. I have lack of eyebrows so I have to use these to first draw the shape and then fill in with brow powder. It actually looks pretty natural if done right; I suggest also using a brow pen for 3d effect. These would not come off onto my skin at first; they have to be warmed up a little.
B0013383NE|1|I can't believe this product was developed by an  M.D. I used one of the pads and my face turned flaming red and stayed that way for 2 hours. I admit I tend to have sensitive skin but I use glycolics on an almost daily basis and this is by far the worst reaction I have ever had. Right after you use the pad, you fell like you just washed your face with Noxcema - it's that tingly feeling. And then your face turns a deep red and stays that way for hours. These are going in the garbage.
B0009OAHCS|5|A wonderful and unique fragrance.  I cannot get enough of it.  I love when my fiance wears it.  It's not over powering and lasts a long time.
B0018A32XS|5|It is nice to find a ladies razor that has been made as sturdy as a mans. so far it works great.
B00BY44SU4|3|Good enough product, slow shipping.
B00M4ZP4NC|5|It was for my granddaughter and she loved it.
B0067F28ZW|1|All OF MY BRUSH HEADS CAME OFF VERY POOR QUALITY!!! wish I could get my money BACK OR SOME NEW BRUSHES!!!!
B002ON11RW|5|I have wanted the coastal scents palettes for so long, they are wonderful and with my christmas Amazon gift certificates, free. These palettes have great color and long wear you cannot go wrong. Plus the selection of color, even in the warm palette is outstanding!
B003YHMJ3C|5|I have really dark hair and it really fits my hair gave me light awesome color used it with 40 volume and I will buy again when my hair grow to touch up my roots :D
B00ALKHY9O|5|I was a little skeptical when I first used the product because I was expecting &#34;drag&#34; while sharpening my dual blade razor. The type of drag you'd expect from a knife blade on a stone. There was none. However as a test I dragged the blade over my face before sharpening and again after sharpening. The blades were dull before and sharp after; that's all the proof I needed.<br /><br />Great product, will probably pat for itself in 6 months. BTW, I also use an old toothbrush to get the dried shaving cream out from between the blades. Works good and sharpening afterward extends the blade's life. Maybe they should include this with the sharpener as a kit.
B008R7CNOE|2|they do hurt a bit, but not too bad.<br />After 3 applications I stopped using them since there is literally no visible result.<br />It does look like your teeth get whiter while you wear them - due to little bubbles underneath the film. But once you brush after each time you see no improvement.<br />At least for me, I do not have horrible stains and my teeth look more or less good - maybe it help in those situations when colors are closer to brown....<br />Yellowish color never gone away even a shade! In any case, I won't use them again. Baking soda with lemon work lots better. It is not possible to get results ANY close to professional whitening.
B0053DCYXA|5|nice product. Thanks
B003EM6C7Q|5|OMG! This is one of the first lotions I have purchased and I always seem to go back to this one! I have tried others but none have given me quicker results or a deeper tan than this Pearfecto by Swedish Beauty! It is my absolute favorite, and I always am sure to have a bottle! After my first visit I noticed instant results, a dark bronze color NO ORANGE! Couldn't have asked for more and my tan lasted for months! I don't know how anyone could try this product and not like it, the smell is also great! Not too perfumey like most scented lotions out there. The only thing I would change is that I just wish it came in a bigger bottle! I always want more! I definitely recommend this product. I do have a natural olive complexion though so I do not know if it works the same for fair skin!
B00BUTESFI|5|The only nail polish I use. It keeps my nails long and strong.
B00IV6F442|5|After finding that we did not have an adapter for a newly acquired appliance we decided to look for a reliable resource for a replacement adapter/charger. The adapter that we purchased from T-Power met my needs and expectations. If I ever find that I needed another adapter, I would certainly consider T-Power as a reliable and cost effective resource.
B001DNG6ZQ|5|what can be said  Came as promised, complete kit, product was as promised and worked as what i have used in the past, easier to find here and ordering was easy and convienent
B00134T5BC|3|they do not desolve well
B008H8HGI6|1|totally happy with purchase and promptness of receiving order
B0093OHLM4|1|I found absolutely no positive results from Raspberry Keytone.  I could not recommend the use of them to anyone.  It's disappointing to to waste money on falsely advertised products.
B002VLZHLI|4|I have been useing this product fo a long time and have found that it works well and it cost much less then Rogaine.
B00QVR0O6Q|5|I am using it every day. It is a light weight oil that absorbs easily into the skin
B006IB5T4W|5|A must have during cold dry winters
B00MQF7OY2|5|Very cute , no complaints.
B002QV0NLM|5|Blends BEAUTIFULLY and doesnt shed. I love it!
B00CNTJHQO|4|Helps with my scalp issues. I spent years using tar shampoo and other shampoo recommended by doctors. However, I find that herbal shampoos help better.
B0009I4J4G|4|As always, great quality.
B000W0C07Y|5|this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product
B003C2AW8S|5|LOVE THESE----these are leaps and bounds above the ones you find at walgreens or target.  Awesome.
B004SHYMIM|5|This takes long to ship but worth the wait as it looks very nice, sturdy, affordable, and best of all makes my life easier handling eyelash extensions.
B00J6L7HAA|5|LOve This product!!! The best tweezer I have ever used!
B004HNFYEI|5|My favorite brand for Men's products & this is an excellent face wash. Also can be used as shave gel.
B00UI3OHG2|5|Very good product.  Makes skin feel so soft.
B009ECMERC|2|Was sent the older version with paraben added as ingredient even though the picture was newer version without paraben.
B0018OVKQ0|5|This is a great brush: it arrived just as described / guaranteed, and the quality is nice.  I use it for dry brushing-- even though I am not an expert on the practice & haven't been doing it for too long, I feel that this will likely get the job done for the majority of individuals who want to reap the benefits of this energizing & healthful regimen.  This brush is priced fairly, well-constructed with materials of natural origin, easy to maneuver, feels great on skin, and arrives fast.  Whether you are health- & wellness-conscious or looking to add a classic, elegant touch to a sumptuous gift basket you're putting together, this is a &#34;yes&#34;! (And if you are crafting a pampering / home-spa style gift basket for someone else, consider ordering a brush for yourself! hehe)
B00HFG0FAM|5|The smell of this lotion is absolutely amazing! I get compliments all the time!
B000PKZFTQ|5|Love this product.  My skin feels wonderfully smooth and makeup flows on easily.
B000YDF6CA|5|I wear contacts, and I have very oily skin. Most eyeliners smudge on me, but this stays put for all day wear. It is a dark, jet black, and it is easy to apply. It doesn't irritate my eyes.
B00147FGJ8|5|I've been buying this lotion for the last year and it's awesome!!! much cheaper than buying it at the local store and the smell is great. I have sensitive skin and the lotion doesn't react negatively to it.  I'm a happy long-term customer!
B00TZ8I53W|5|I love this productI mostly, I keep it in my shower and use it as a moisturizer while my skin is still damp...  I use it again after I get dried a bit... It is like silk and absorbs beautifully...  It never transfers to my clothing, which I appreciate...  I also use this for a variety of other things...  There are so many other applications for Coconut Oil!  I use it as a moisturizer for my face, especially when I want to really want to hydrate it, like right after I do a deeper peel on my face, this will go right on after that treatment...  I use it on my hands prior to doing dishes to protect them a little bit...  It comes off, of course, but my hands have had a little treatment, then I reapply...  Sometimes, apply heavily on my hands and wear cotton gloves to bed...  It's a wonderful scalp and hair treatment...  There are days I put a thick layer on my hair and massage my scalp, leave it on overnight, then wash hair...  It also works to take sticky labels off!  A product I love having!
B007VDWFZC|1|these are a great product but one box for $8 is a rip off. I get the same box for $3 at my local beauty supply.
B00UKCR4RU|5|Great product! My hair dry and frizzy, but using this hair mask 2 times a week has changed the texture of my hair and has helped with the breakage. I love it!
B0000YUXI0|1|My 5 year old won't stop sucking on her index finger..we've tried a bunch of different products to stop thumb sucking and fingernail biting. All with little effectiveness.<br /><br />I ordered this and another product similar to it and I swear she LIKES the taste of it. I've asked her if it bothers her or if is 'icky' and she's told me no.<br /><br />I'd say that's a failure.<br /><br />I wish I could say this helped at all, i'd like to find something nice to say about it (okay, it came nicely packaged) but thats about it.<br /><br />I'd turn somewhere else to find a truely effective product to stop these habits.
B0000AXZV5|1|money wasted !
B004Z216P2|5|I use to have red bumps and dry beaches on my nose and this soap takes care of it and leaves my skin feeling great.we even use it on our dogs ears that get dry patches.. Great product.
B00B1E7B3S|5|Fits everything i need. Very well made. Highly reccomend it!  Cant beat the price. My friend got the same from a different place for almost 400$.
B006PKVYMC|4|Nice cap, but the print is not attractive.  I am not going for fashion so this is not a big deal.
B008CRWS7G|5|Can't wait to see the Jr Bridemaids wear these.  They will be so excited to look and feel like princesses.
B001T8W7J4|1|I decided to try this item out when I spotted it at the drugstore. Having wanted to give gel eyeliner a go for a while, I was excited when it seemed to stay put and remain vibrant. However, I gradually noticed that the brush it came with would get stiffer and less maneuverable the more I used it. Moreover, the bristles stayed stiff even after I cleaned and dried the brush. At first I thought it was a defect of the brush and not the eyeliner. But even after I bought a new, well-reviewed eyeliner brush, it got cakey and brittle and was impossible to a apply without making a mess. Do yourself a favor and opt for other gel liners. This one's a bust.
B0043OYFKU|5|I use this brush every single day for over a year now and I miss it terribly if I go somewhere and don't bring it. I wonder how much better the expensive versions can be (even though I love it, could never bring myself to spend $199 on 'those'). This one does an awesome job, lasts a very long time even though I use it in the shower every day.
B005Y6F4WO|5|Perfect especially being a beginner nail artist.....Love these tools & Very Pretty and Colorful Will definitely order again in the future
B007JJ2DO6|5|Love this!
B001E8GENO|5|This lotion was ordered as a holiday gift for a family member.  She was delighted and the lotion arrived with no issues and in perfect condition.
B000HX4IT4|4|I am a sixty-four year old woman and have been using Cellex-C on and off for several years. I am again returning to Cellex-C because it works really well for me. The change in my skin smoothness and brightness is apparent in a relatively short time. My skin has a glow that even my husband has noticed. I guess I'll be staying with this product for a long time. I'm through trying other \\"amazing products\\"! This is my amazing product.
B000A3XI06|5|This is a salon color, so mixing is tricky if you don't know how. But basic mix is 2 oz. color, 2 oz. peroxide. with this product, I recommend a 30 volume so it comes out darker.
B009KBO3DA|5|I use this oil in my hair and on my skin, it healed a few break out acne quickly. My face is brighter and smooth.
B007UO4SAW|2|after 2 months of occasional use, it stopped working. this is the not the first time this has happened with this time...years ago the same thing happened.
B003ANMOHG|4|I will purchase this product in the future, I am really satisfied with it...! Perfect for this busy summer it save you a lots of time..
B00EZTXP8G|5|Keeps hair looking great without stiffness, also adds a fresh light scent and some shine
B0083V8SE8|3|WILL ORDER THAT AGAIN , VERY GOOD
B004B7BWZ0|5|Finally!! Estee Lauders Cinnabar in a lotion!!  As U may know, this is a very spicy, sultry scent--which I love, but the fragrance is so strong AND it comes in a spray, which is hard to control. But the Lotion is perfect.. I put it right where i want and have total control as to how much!!! YAAAYY.. thanks.. Oh, and hooray to Amazon---this stuff was here F-A-S-T!!!!!
B00MQ6BE92|4|My body butter arrived  a few days ago and I decided  to use it daily  on my entire  body. I love  the fact that  this  lotion  features  key ingredients  such  as Shea Butter, avocado  oil, and kukui nut oil. I applied  it every  night  before  bed. This butter  is super  rich  and  moisturizing. My legs were starting  to have  that  alligator  look and now they don't. I wish  this  scent was way stronger. It's to faint for me. Also this  butter absorbs  at a slower rate. That's why  I  choose  to apply  at night. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.
B0091GN71I|5|Been doing a lot a teens with this color  they love them
B0009A11C2|5|I am so happy to finally find some products that are NATURAL and have organic ingredients. This product works great, it makes my hair feel so silky. It smells very fresh as well.
B0027A7CLG|4|I was looking for a BB Cream that would provide good coverage for my spots and unevenness.  This product did the trick.  My skin is dry with yellow undertones and this product blended well into my skin.  I have also bought the SKIN79 Super+ Beblesh Balm but find the shade of the MISSHA much more natural and warm and the coverage thicker and smoother.  I do wear a serum underneath and sometimes will wear a light moisturizer if my skin is extra dry.  Overall, I love this product and would definitely order again.
B00BQDV9DC|5|I Love it!
B00C2H2VQA|5|As much as I dislike all of the plastic and shoving various bits of it into the Earth, this is a small and excellent flosser. The flossing ends last for quite some time, don't break quickly and are very small, thus allowing access into the deepest recesses without getting your fingers mucky. This is the best device I have used to date. It is comfortable in the hand, it's longer body reaches back to the molars  with relative ease and the heads are easily swappable. Glad I have this.
B003O4EIRA|5|CND has given us the premium polish.  Rich, one-coat coverage.  Saturated pigmentation means no streaks, smooth application.  As a professional, I recommend this polish line.
B00GOY8FKS|5|Perfect size for my purse.
B00OSZF1NY|4|Okay, first off, yes, this may suck, but second off, the whole point of them being super cheap is clearly coz they aren't very good quality. But hello, it's called using eye shadow base/primer and it comes of pretty well!! I used NYX white eyeshadow base and it looked bangin. I will post pictures up on my instagram for everyone to see how you can turn a bad quality eyeshadow into a beast one. ✊ find me on instagram  by googling this:  ---------------isabellajosephine99@gmail.com  instagram
B000052YQ0|5|When I buy moisturizer the single most important factor is the SPF, and I also consider the price. This is a good moisturizer that not only has the proper ingredients to provide great sun protection, but is also reasonably priced and lasts a long time. I will buy another brand if it has the right ingredients and is cheaper, but this brand is available at most stores and I know I can trust it.
B00641UCY8|5|For some background: I have fine, pin-straight hair. I am not the target or typical user for this product as it is typically used for people with curly hair. That being said, I love this stuff. I abuse my hair with dyes, bleach, and heat, but after washing with this instead of shampoo my hair has never felt healthier.
B00TYAGR9A|4|There are those times in life that you realize as much as you love &#34;WEN&#34; it's overpriced for what it is. I am also intent on sticking to my budget. So with trepidation I purchased &#34;Renpure Lavender Cleansing Conditioner,&#34; since it is 4X less expensive than &#34;WEN.&#34;  &#34;Renpure Lavender&#34; has a sweet scalp-tingling scent but the consistency of this shampoo is much too thin and watery, the shampoo does not grab on to the hair like &#34;WEN&#34; does so you will use more product to properly cleanse and condition the hair. The price of &#34;Renpure&#34; is right where it should be, the scent is on note but the consistency is the big difference. My Results: &#34;Renpure&#34; is comparable to &#34;WEN&#34; in that my color-treated hair did not fade, the lovely scent lingers and my hair looks good.  However, as for bounce and shine, &#34;WEN&#34; stands alone. If &#34;Renpure&#34; used a thicker consistency I think it would increase volume and improve shine. It would be 5 Stars if not for the thin and watery consistency, the cost fits my budget and that's the key.
B008X7897S|5|Only improvement would be made here in the U.S. I could not detect any flaws in the workmanship or material.  This is the 80mm length but the newer model is 85mm long.  Should thread right on to any vintage Gillette head or modern DE razor.
B00BPFUBW6|5|The Product is great to use for your skin.
B00GOBSV96|5|I had heard good things about this type of product from other individuals who had tried, so I decided to try it myself. I have used several mainstream adult acne treatments and without much luck on any. So far the use of the bentonite clay has proven to reduce redness and irritation, all while leaving my skin feeling soft and clean. I plan to introduce others to this excellent product.
B0081MQ47C|5|I love this toothbrush. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I bough this to replace my old Sonicare elite, which I have had for about 10 years. This model is a step up, with rubber grips, and a built in timer. This is a fantastic toothbrush, and I would reccomend it to anyone.
B000GFZWE8|5|I've enjoyed Humectress over the last 20 years. I know the formula has changed. Regardless, it's still a good product that leaves your hair soft and easy to braid. I really like the pump dispenser. Very user friendly!
B00VR3B46I|4|This product works great! Happy to use amazon as a supplier
B002TXIRLK|5|every good!
B00CWDBMSM|4|This product is light and won't leave your skin oily.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I have only used it for a few days now but so far so good, I'm happy with this product.
B0084A5PWQ|5|The best bb-cream I have ever used. The color is great on my face and it's not too moist I can use my make up and my skin doesn't look oily. I totally recommend it.
B00IQMRHR8|5|Item arrived on time and as described.
B000FQMIWM|4|Love love love the smell of Agree, but I do use another quality conditioner under it.
B002Z7FVPA|5|exactly what i expected. perfect. well packaged. original packaging. condition new . what more can i say than that. i was very happy to find this product as i had used it for years before only to find it was discontinued.
B001CTQMIC|3|They do the job, but the place where the strap connects to the pouf feels extremely sharp and can graze you if you put that side down toward your skin. As long as you keep the strap around your wrist the whole time you're using the pouf, you don't have to worry about that and they work well.
B000HJZS10|5|I mean, I really cant say much except... oh wait, YES I CAN!! This stuff is unbelievably useful. As a male college student, I work with a very low budget but I still would buy the acne clinique system, lotions, and s*** for my body to treat individual things I didnt like. acne set for obviously acne, certain lotion to keep me moisturized, and certain lotion to rid me of random blemishes and stuff. I would buy different body washes but all of them just made my skin angry in certain areas (Im a freak about my skin, and so ANY blemish is irritating to me). I bought Dr. bronners tea tree, and guess what?? Literally does all of that stuff for me. 1.) Its the perfect face wash for guys, maybe not girls idk. My skin would get oily easily while Im home in Hawaii and this stuff does great at oil control plus moisture But when it got to winter time and I thought this would dry my skin out back at school in Indiana, IT DIDNT! I dont know why but it cleared up all my acne, and I have flawless skin, all over my body now. Maybe my body just hated the chemicals, or maybe tea tree is just amazing (I also have lemon and notice that it also does a good job at keeping blemishes away).<br /><br />I also use this as a shampoo, and was shocked to realize that it is also the perfect shampoo for my hair. I have pretty thick hair though, and so it leaves it clean, smooth, and soft but it doesnt dry out and fro up.<br /><br />I also use this as a cleaner. I mix 1 part of tea tree, 1 part of lemon, and then 20 parts water in all. Cleans stuff like a boss, and people always comment how my place is so clean.<br /><br />I also use this as my laundry detergent. And once again, keeps my going out clothes nice and my regular every day clothes nice also. Its very gentle.<br /><br />I also use this for shaving!! Its perfect for shaving. It leaves your skin moisturized after and it feels really smooth.<br /><br />WARNING: I will say this, as soon as you wash your body with it, it kinda feels weird on your skin for like 5 minutes. Like you used a bar soap. But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower and you will feel how good it is on your skin.sed a bar soap. But honestly, just wait 5 minutes after your shower and you will feel how good it is on your skin.
B0037HP9OA|5|Best thing for your bikini line ladies!!
B0051ZHQEC|1|I received it totally broken. Not even worth my time and money to bother returning it. Junk. Don't waste your time with this one.
B0056GDG90|5|Works great for adding lots of volume to my hair.  Makes my hair look straight but full.  Glad I bought it.
B001E77A0G|5|STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
B0047UNCD6|5|Product is great, used it many times before, pefect for sensitive skin. No burning No irritation No after effects...... Perfect!!!
B00K5YZDXK|1|Does not work at all!! Waist of Money!!<br />I trusted all the reviews but when i got it, it didn't work nothing for me!
B00L8BOXEO|1|This was not the cure for my son's molluscum.  We used it diligently, twice a day for three weeks, and saw absolutely no difference, except maybe a few (of the 30) spots were more dry.  I was very disappointed we didn't see better results with this product, since it gets great reviews all over the internet.    I'm not sure if some children's molluscum is more stubborn, but no product or home-remedy we tried worked to eliminate any spots.  Also, we did two rounds of liquid nitrogen which did nothing.    What ended up finally working was using hydrogen peroxide for a few days on each spot (just a tiny amount to help dry them out), and then manually removing the white core from each spot.  This was LESS painful for my son than the liquid nitrogen.  After the white core was removed, we cleaned the spot, and then covered it with antibiotic cream and a band-aid.  We tackled a few spots each day, and after a week - all the spots were finally healing.    Also - Just an aside - I am curious as to whether or not several of the 5 star reviews are faked.  If you look at the Reviewers information, this is their only review - which is a tell-tale sign that its a fake account.
B000052YBA|5|Quality item.  Thank you.  Klara
B008BI63LI|1|I've used this relaxer in the past and it worked well. This one was horrible! my hair reverted in three days!
B001AO0WCG|5|I've tried dozens of products to keep my coarse fly-away locks smooth and nothing else, regardless of price, has even come close.
B000BVXPV4|1|it was not a men splash,is the same women fragance,it wasnt what we expect,I got very dissapointed,no diference at all
B007IX2DL6|1|i haven't tried this product yet because they lie to there costumers and the price is extremely high for only 0.5 oz come on ridiculous
B000FQRKRU|1|When I ordered this toothbrush, it said it came with replacement heads. Even another reviewer said their's came with 4 replacement heads. What I got, 3-4 weeks after I ordered, was a single toothbrush with no replacement heads. Had it not come all the way from Japan I would have returned it!
B00QXIDW2G|5|First of all, the little burlap bag that this product comes in is adorable (wife's opinion)! Per my husband, this oil is good for a beard that's being grown out and is past the stubble phase. It helps with the itchiness and keeps the skin moisturized and soft. This is oil, so a little goes a long way. The bottle will last a really long time. The ingredients are all natural, quality, and Made in the USA, which is a huge plus.
B00JAA15DC|3|They are ok.
B002JUKVM6|5|This perfume smells delicous.  A grown up scent but not too mature.  Light but sophisticated. Definitely a great Christmas present for the upcoming holidays.  A Winner!!
B003LSZHQ0|4|I love the peachy blush, it really flatters my skin tone :) It looks so natural, you can wear it all year round!
B009A9LCWC|5|I am a nurse and this nail polish does not come off with the alcohol based sanitizer that we use. I clean my hands all day long and they keep on shining.
B00DVPXFKS|4|Its my third pursues of this brand! Excellent item!
B003DQDCRG|1|This lipstick was old stock - manufactured 2008 (6 years old). Way too old to be used safely.  Very disappointing.
B0027WPJRI|5|I really like this product.  It seems, to me, my make up goes on smoother & looks better.
B00F76E7UQ|5|I have seriously dry feet (thanks, Mom!). Scratchy, calloused, alligator feet, that crack like California in a high fault area. Seriously rough. I don't wear sandals, because they are so bad (even in summer). The cracks are painful, and the ridges I develop on the edge of my feet make my tile floors that much more slippery for me.  When I get a pedicure, I pay extra for them to break out the cheese grater and file the rough patches off. I have several pumice stones, a PedEgg, have used various emulsions and creams, etc., including a heavy duty one from my podiatrist. My feet have beat them all.  I wondered how on earth a scrub brush can do what they could not, but was desperate to try again.  I have severe arthritis and mobility issues, plus a general lack of limber-ness ( I know, not a word). The reviews of this scrubber ,and the fact that I don't have to bend to use it (other than pick it up), convinced me to give it a try.<br /><br />My feet are SOOOOO smooth! It's crazy that this scrubber can make such a difference, but it does. It didn't happen over night, but within a few days, I could feel a difference. After a couple weeks, my husband told me my feet are like butter, lol. And I am not putting any moisturizer on them, for the sake of science. Just squirt a little soap on it, and scrub my feet while I shower. I won't be doing any foot modeling, but I can wear sandals, etc. without shame, now. That is HUGE! I haven't even felt the need for a professional pedicure since I started using this scrubber. And I guarantee, the &#34;cheese grater&#34; will not be coming out the next time I do.<br /><br />It has suction cups, that hold it on the walls of my shower just fine, but cannot grip my textured shower floor. However, the side flaps are wide enough to stand on with one foot, while scrubbing the other. That is a very small price to pay for soft feet. I rinse it thoroughly and hang on the shower wall after every use (and no one else in the house is allowed to use it!), It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.t!), It dries completely, and has no mold or mildew issues.
B003MTPUYC|5|I have been using these products for about 18 months.  I like how my skin feels and it does help with the wrinkles.
B00BPXLTI8|5|I have ordered this a couple times and really enjoy this product. I use it at night on my hands and feet before bed and in the morning they are soft again (:  I use all the larger pieces first and when I get down to the flakes that are left, I microwave them until they are soft and then roll them into a large piece. It is raw with no fillers so don't expect it to be like store bought garbage with all the additives! It smells fantastic too!
B00B406WDY|4|Quick delivery, brand new, smells great
B005XUNG5I|5|Bought this for my husband.  He uses it all the time and really likes it.
B00BGUTMIE|5|this VS Platinum ranks up there in my top 3 favorites! women love it! Guys in a relationship. Beware!! This cologne will get you lots of complements! other women complimenting you in front of your girlfriend..... lets just say there could be some jealousy in the air ha ha. Im the type of guy who loves to smell good where ever i go. i own over 40 scents for all seasons of the year and this one is a 'Must own'. what makes it so good and why women love it so much is that. it was created by 'Women For Men'. ......stop reading and just buy and you&#34;ll see!
B00FN3KF18|5|I love it! I've used quite a number of products on my daughter's curls, and this is a great butter cream. It smells pretty good too. I have a feeling I will be trying more TGIN products in the near future :)) I will say I'd love to try a butter cream from this brand with a different scent. The scent is nice but I'm not crazy about it.
B003XKY57S|5|This is the second time I have purchased this oil.  It absorbs right away.  I use it only on my face.
B004ZD2M6I|5|Easy to use. Makes you skin feel super clean and stimulated. A good item for your beauty routine and easy to store.
B00EY80YYQ|5|Good quality vs the low price. Only take too long for delivery.
B00J2PG8IC|5|Fantastic product although delivery takes a little while as they don't operate in the US
B007RG93OE|5|When i started to buy this kind of products i didn't realized how to use them,but i bought this and i want to keep using this! i really love it and it is so usefull,you will feel the energy in your whole body! this is an amazing product and is in an amazing price!!!<br />Must use it!!!
B007KBFIPY|5|Really calms down freeze. It not oily. Fabulous product
B001B0YMB6|5|I have never had my make up so organized in my life, I'm in my late 30's and this is just great.  Once you pack your favorite stuff in, you can move it anywhere.  Love it!
B00C5AHXEE|5|its been a year since i bought this and im still using the moisturizer and the case it came in i use for all my makeup now :D its great definatly a good starter kit
B00FSBNCR4|5|One of the few lotions that has a very nice 'gentle' orange scent.  Just the right texture, not too thick, not too thin.  I wish they would make this in a jar.  Seems that all lotions in bottles leave about an inch on the bottom that you can't get out when nearing the end of the product.
B00C28ENB0|5|Nice and useful product. My wife loved them. She used them every week.
B00AO7AOOG|5|Wonderful color! Absolutely beautiful! Would definitely recommend this to a friend. Great buy and a beautiful stunning color. Love love!
B001E0WH6K|5|I cannot handle the chemicals contained in semi-permanent dyes.  So I decided to go the herbal route and chose to do a Henna treatment.  This product is fantastic.  I forgot how nice I looked without my grey hair.  My hair is rich in color and full.  I look in my early 30's instead of early 40's.
B002Q80IR4|5|It's hard to find a 5 inch Shear. I've been using the Centrix C500 for years and will continue to.
B002JEXTSA|5|I am an African Amercian female with severly damaged hair.  I'm not sure if it was damaged because of the perms, too much heat or the products that I was using (either individually or together) but for whatever reason my hair shed, broke and split (ends) (severely) with every comb, brush wash.  So I looked up what a good line would be for stressed/damaged hair: the Redken Extreme line had very favourable reviews so I decided to give it a try.  And I must say that this line is EXTREMEly good and worth the money you spend.  Because I want to wear my natural hair out (and I sweat so much on my scalp) I had to give myself a perm.  This is the process that I did and it made my hair feel healthy and new:<br />1.Perm<br />2.Extreme CAT<br />3.Extreme Strength Builder<br />4.Hot Oil Treatment mixed in with Deep Condition (I used TRESemme Moisture Rich-Luxurious Moisture)<br />5.Extreme Anti-Snap<br />***Also, I used a little bit of BioSilk (put in right after the Anti-Snap), then blow-dryed and then again when I flat ironed it and it felt like new***<br />As far as the shedding and split ends go, shedding will never go away, plain and simple because hair has to shed to give way to new, healthy hair.  However, this did minimize the amount of shedding that I usually have.  As for breakage/split ends, I got them clipped when I got my perm and again just last night and since using that, my split ends were miniscule (which is what I have been aiming at for years).  So as far as this line goes, I'm willing to pay the price as long as my hair is healthy.
B006L1DNWY|4|Chinese junk
B00C9ZDQ6E|2|I personally didn't like the smell other people did. It had a vanilla smell to me which I didn't like.
B006OZF4KG|1|very waxy and hard to wash off, felt like i was just covering my face in wax, perfect for you if that is what you're looking for
B000ALB1VQ|5|I have tried the Remingtons, the Brauns...etc and none compare to the Panasonic.  I only wished I had read the reviews and gone with the Panasonic first.  It shaves quick and without a doubt it is the closest electric shave.  No skin irritation.   <br /> <br />The 8077 cleaning system is the only one that does not use alcohol...so it doesn't evaporate like the Braun and Remington cleaning systems.   <br /> <br />The 8077 can also be cleaned manually using soap and water.  It is a wet/dry shaver so it works as well in the shower as out.  You can also use shaving cream with this shaver.  Absolutely amazing product. <br /> <br />I was initially a skeptic after reading the reviews...but I was wrong.  This shaver is all the others have said and more. <br /> <br />On top of everything else, this Panasonic shaver is cheaper than the competitors in this space.   This shaver is worth every penny and then some. <br /> <br />Don't waste time with the others...order the Panasonic and treat yourself to a better shave.
B00C13G21A|1|This product is the worst face cleanser I have ever bought. I do not have sensitive skin. I did not have what most people have happen with it leaving a film. What happened for me was, even though I did not use it on my neck area, I broke out in a major rash all up and down my neck and jaw line. The rash is red and itchy and its awful! I can't stop scratching. I was fine the night i used it and then i woke up in the middle of the night tearing my neck up from the scratching. Hydrocortizone cream wont even stop the itch. The other thing that happened was, I went no where near my eyes or even my under eye area. I used it around my nose, cheek and jaw area and forehead. By the time i got out of the shower, my undereye area was on fire and swollen. Face cleasers should not do this! Do not buy this product!
B000JWQ3OG|5|Thank you. Very quick and good.  Just what I needed, to start and finish the day.<br />Keep up the good work.<br />What every American should have.
B001ET76E4|5|Very happy with this order. I can't find this in stores. This is a great price and love this soap so soft and good for your skin. I will order again!!
B00Q3G3UNO|1|Scent is 100% perfume and smells exactly like Victoria Secrets &#34;Love Spell&#34;. My roommates is a hair stylist and when she saw the bottle, she said that it's not &#34;all natural&#34; at all, and 80% of the ingredients are actually synthetic. The smell was so fake that I have to return it without even trying it. It's not floral, it's not natural and it's not a &#34;light scent&#34;. It's overpowering perfume that doesn't smell like any &#34;natural&#34; ingredient that I have ever seen or used.
B0002G21GI|1|did not hold heat and took forever to get somewhat hot,  much prefer the Remington travel rollers
B001PDD6ZW|4|I just bought this at the local store, it's actually cheaper there....In the store it was $14. To me this me is very similar to the Nivea sensative balm that I buy in store also. Price wise I think it could be a little cheaper since the Nivea is cheaper (I think about half the price) for the same amount, however the Nivea doesn't really have a scent. This stuff has a great scent in my opinion, its a really fresh kind of scent. Unlike a lot of the products out there that make you smell like an old man.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy using this after shaving, it soothes and rehydrates my skin and smells great. The only reason I docked it a star is the pricing. This stuff is priced higher than comparably performing products in my honest opinion.
B004FD5WO2|3|The color of this polish is very bright and intense. I think it's beautiful, however, it is a little tricky to apply and dries with zero shine. I end up using a high shine top coat whenever I use this polish. Overall, it's okay. I just wish I knew it was matte before I purchased it.
B003UKKHB4|5|After reading consumer reports, having used Oral-B's Vitality brush, and read the product comparisons on Oral-B's website, I got two of these, one for me and one for my wife.  It is an amazing product that makes my teeth feel dentist-chair clean every time I use it, and appears to clean as well as the more expensive ones.  The initial charge on the battery has lasted well over a week.
B00HJD8NLY|3|The smell is really nice but you should notice the texture is not clear as posted on the website. The serum is light, spread easily. But that's about it. I haven't seen any improvement on my skin AT ALL. Waste of money. You can spend a little more for Skinceutical Blemish (for acne scar and anti-aging) which works wonder for me, but pretty expensive for my budget. I guess you get what you pay for is very true.
B0002G214U|5|Very pleased works excellent with hair in rollers and even without enrollers it just gives a good body that way
B001KYNUHU|5|Good item and good price
B000FP63M4|5|this batttery pack works just great,charged battery works like new. I was able to instal with out soldering leads to geather.
B002IV5H70|5|Excellent product-beyond my expectations-the chrome gloss and vibrant colours set this off-wired to plug in-ready to go-great-hardware included-Thanks -I would say more at this point to achieve my 20 word review minimum but I was already done.
B004Z67NSM|5|Love these!
B00CBW6VIU|2|I have been wearing these for 6 months now...They do keep the earrings on.  My big complaint is that they have a rough edge on the back that snags my clothing.  They are all like this--I checked all in the package.  It has permanently snagged several items.  I would not recommend them for this reason., I would try another product.
B009XPRZKG|5|Great bargain.
B000C1W5GY|5|excelente
B00KYZA8DA|4|Item was well received and arrived as described. No issues molding the guards with the instructions provided. Great price per item and would order from here again if needed.
B005LF0QZI|5|I don't know how long these have been on the market, I hope not long, as I would hate to think I have been using wood picks when these were available.  I sure am glad that Sam's Club quit caring toothpicks, as I would have never discovered these.<br /><br />Opening the top for the first time can be a challenge.  The entire center section of top, slides in the direction indicated. It does not lift up, nor does it push down. Stick your thumbnail in the end, and it will slide open. Trying to slide it by pressing your thumb on the knurled surface is fruitless. Ignore all the things on top that look like holes that need to be drilled out or pushed in.
B003H146PY|3|ok
B0025V9PSU|5|Good stuff. Helps heal the skin and leaves it soft.
B002RTF2AK|5|Works brilliantly on my gums. I use it daily and now that I've started, I won't be without it.
B008CEDY5O|5|love it
B002OCANQI|5|Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said; if you want to get rid of irritation and have smooth skin for days these are the razors for you.
B004HYSIZ4|5|Excellent
B00885CTO4|5|I love Matrix. It's affordable and does wonders to my hair. I like it better than Nexus and it costs a fraction of the price.
B002O0D8P8|5|I have been using both shampoo and conditioner since 6/2/14 when I received my shipment. I have already noticed a difference. My problem was not severe but I felt like I could see my scalp a lot because my hair was thinning around the crown. I have noticed new growth and little baby hairs popping up on the crown of my head. Annoying to tame but any growth is awesome. I also feel like my hair is softer and fuller which is a great plus for my thin hair.<br /><br />My hair care routine consist of this shampoo and conditioner and I alternate with Mane and Tail shampoo which I bought from Sally's.
B00FOGKPC8|3|Kind of disappointing.  I hope the person I give it to enjoys it but the presentation is not so nice.  No little gift box to show it off a little.
B00U5I377K|5|This is a really pretty color. It is a lavender microglitter suspended in clear base. It looks great on it's own or used as a topcoat over another color. It dries pretty quickly. It is easily removed with regular strength polish remover. Overall I love this polish and the whole Elsa collection.
B00HYB2RSQ|2|Alright, so I bought this vibration pore brush in order to help make sure my cleanser really gets into my skin, and this product claims to do this. It is true that when I first tested it out, the product did seem to give off that effect. I was quite happy with it because the brushes were what seemed extremely high quality and not irritating to the skin at all. A lot of the reviews claimed how it didn't really make people break out like what other vibration spinning brushes do and I experienced the same thing. The whole reason I bought this product was that it wasn't incredibly expensive like the clairsonic, and the reviews even compared its quality to the clairsonic.  After using it for awhile, I would say that people who compare it to the clairsonic are making quite a huge mistake.  The big difference between this face shop brush and the clairsonic would lie in the durability and the construction of this product. After using it for a week, the results was as the product describes, however I am not sure if the product I received was defective (pretty sure it wasn't because it worked for the first week), but after awhile of continuous use the brush pieces would not connect to the main body of the brush. The brush and body of the brush are connected by quite a flexible, black thin rubber material (or at least mine was quite flimsy). This rubber material is what causes the brush to spin, and when I noticed that it had broken I questioned why such a thin mechanic was used and expected to last for long. If you look at the image, you will see what I am talking about when I say the middle section broke off. I was appalled because I had not remove the brush incorrectly, yet it literally turned brittle and was stuck in the brush head when I gently removed it.  My hopes is that if you plan on buying this product you be VERY careful with attaching the brush head, and VERY careful when taking it off, because this product might not be worth its money in that it doesn't seem likea very long term product. The material is quite fragile, and I am now pretty much left with a useless brush and brush pieces that will not attach to the main body because of either the specific product I received, or even the product itself (each of them). I found it sort of questionable why they don't even sell replacement brushes, but I figured you're probably meant to keep buying the brush. I was quite unsatisfied with this buying experience and I'm very disappointed because I had really high expectations for this product. This would actually be my first time experiencing this in all my Amazon purchases, and I'm quite sad to say it was from one my favorite brands &#34;The Face Shop&#34;.
B0016D4RQS|3|great sences
B000BIUGFK|3|The blade is quiet wide and it only works in a certain angle
B0088L01CU|5|This is a life saver! It looks so nature that nobody can tell I wear it. It covers my newly grown grey hair so I don't have to dye my hair so often anymore. I wear it everyday and got a second one too. Thank you for making such a great product.
B000F63TW0|4|I used as directed.  Made my skin soft and glowing.  The first time I used it a few days later my face broke out in a few spots, guess it's like getting a facial in getting rid of all the impurities in my skin.  Great Kit.
B003I36I20|5|I lost mine in the theaters and knew i had to get another! It came in just in time and in good conditions! Love it!
B000052Y6A|3|OK
B004SNN53Y|4|Really like this product,highly recommends it. It works well
B001CEFDA0|5|I wasn't sure about this one because I couldn't remember ever smelling it before , but I'm glad I tried it .<br />Sunshine now rates right up top with Patchouli and Sandalwood as my favorite scents !
B00066D4M4|2|I am black with 3c type hair.<br />this leave in is not for me, leaves a stinky/dry feeling in my hair<br /><br />it also has alcohol as a main ingredient
B00H2T4PR6|5|I guess I always thought that I just had &#34;bad&#34; curls - not the nice, smoothe looking curls/waves I always wanted and then came the DevaFuser.  In all seriousness, I cannot believe the difference in my hair after drying with this device.  It's really exciting for me because being able to wear my hair curly (and not blow it out) saves me so much time and with 22 month old twin boys time is at a premium these days.  I can honestly say that I love my curls when using the DevaFuser to dry them (even more so than air drying).  I've also found that the DevaCurl products make a huge difference too.  As you can tell, I'm definitely a believer.  Highly recommend!<br /><br />Note:  I read other reviewers saying the device didn't fit their hairdryers which definitely may be true of certain models but I, too, thought this didn't fit mine until I realized that I had to push it all the way onto the barrel - it doesn't sit at the end like other diffusers.
B00P017SVI|4|The block of soap is awful and makes your skin feel filmy/dry (as blocks of soap are wont to do) and the brush is to be used ONLY on your body (it is way too rough for the face, I ended up having to buy a face brush separately). The balm, however, is a life changing jar of magic. The texture, which is similar to Vaseline, is intimidating at first, but after two weeks, I'm completely addicted. My skin is smooth, clear, moisturized and glowing. I will never use standard moisturizer again. This would absolutely be five stars if not for the misleading brush and useless soap.
B0015TKA1O|3|Pros : Product sticks well to foot bottom if clean. I used alcohol and cotton ball. Cons : Needs to be a little thicker to take weight off the ball and disperse across pad. After an injury it is not sufficient on its own & I had to combine with a shoe insert to relieve pain and facilitate healing but better than nothing. Not too much available that I saw that is better but my search was limited.
B004WMFVU6|5|This is a very good product.
B000GHVKVA|4|Exactly what I was looking for, very good scent and good quality.
B005F1ATJQ|5|Dissolves easily. Using for a supplement,  not a bath. No scent. Will last forever! Got our recipe from Food Renegade.
B0082CWU9C|5|I am.obsessed with this shampoo and conditioner!  It is fantastic, my hair feels so soft and smells amazing after.
B002BPUOM6|5|Excellent right on time. Great fragrance.
B001M3ELG8|5|You get what you pay for. This is a high quality, dense, soft brush that should last a very long time. It replaces a Bare Escentuals brush that died of old age after about 15 years of daily use, plus being cleaned many times with gentle shampoo. The late brush had a longer handle, which I preferred to this stubby one. The quality of the brush is just as important as the quality of the make-up, and Bare Escentuals gets high marks from me.
B00J8CP0L0|3|Great color and seals well, but is actually a little on the small side of the dimensions.
B005XRZOWO|5|The polish consist on pink glitter and pink metal circles of different sizes ( the biggest is aprox. 1 mm of diameter) in a clear base. I agree that you have to be carefull when you applied it because it can crumple, and the color base have to be well dry or you are going to damage it. As many glitter nail polishes it leave a rough surface and it's mandatory to aply a clear coat over it. I'd recommend to use for that purpouse orly's \\"won't chip\\" for a lasting result. I've used \\"a cut above\\" over orly's \\" french manicure white\\",  sally hansen's \\"mauve it\\" (pink), and orly's \\"liquid vynil\\" (black), and the swatches results were amazing. So far I'm very happy with my purchase. A last suggestion in order to prevent any crumpling or getting a more sparse glitter you can add some drops of a nail lacquer thinner.
B001CT053U|5|It a mind blowing fragrance filled with an array of flavors. Whether your out on the town, a casual bistro,  or just entertaining at home. This scent will have people guessing.  I simply love the scent. Its an ice breaker, so don't fumble, cause you'll be wondering about the one that got away.
B008Y715EG|5|I bought this for my mother and she loves it! The fragrance is lovely and it makes your hands very soft.
B0038T184W|4|I'm a 40 year old male.  I use it for myself.  I'm just getting done with brutal northern U.S. winter weather.  I was using this for a while before the weather started getting milder and I think it works.  I started noticing what I believe are wrinkles around the \\"crows\\" feet area?  Started using this and I believe it is helping.  Hasn't made me break out once or suffer any other allergic reaction.  Couldn't give it 5 stars for its hefty price tag though.  $50 for 1 oz?  I think that's like gold!
B0016D4RQS|4|I feel I am going to go through these quickly. They smell great and bring a nice ambiance to the place!
B004VZA9Z6|5|Went to a Memorial Day ceremony and was the only one who didn't get sunburned!
B000BLNUPU|5|I have a regular sized Helen of Troy hair dryer and this diffuser fits perfectly. There's a good amount of teeth to grab hair and it works great, thank you
B002VECJ2U|4|The product covers my skin fairly well, and is a verry good powder foundation, one of the best. I took away a star beacause this shade is just waaaay to dark for my pale skin! Other than that, good product! (:
B000V2ACH8|5|I'm a white guy with thin brown hair and this stuff works great for my hair style, perhaps I'll attach a photo of what my hair looks like before and after I use this stuff. Maybe later.  Smells great by the way, not too strong but the smell lingers in a good way. Not a girly smell either, i'd describe it as a unisex smell i guess?  It's really tough to wash out though.   Very unique texture, unlike anything I have ever tried before and it seems like i've tried it all.  Give it a shot! I plan on trying more Gatsby products in the future.
B001TPZ3CA|5|Smells nice. This is a must for christmas. Every year she gets this and love it. Little pricy but well worth it.
B00CP0R5LK|4|I try to take good care of my hair, so I use heat sparingly.  When I do, I use a heat shield liquid like Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield.  Unlike some other heat shields I've used, this one doesn't spray in a mist.  We're supposed to pump it into our hands and then apply to the hair.<br /><br />It does weigh down the hair more than other heat shields, but it also give it more sheen and I feel it protects better - maybe because I get more coverage when I slather it on with my hands.<br /><br />The one thing I don't like is how my hands look when I'm done.  It makes me want to keep wiping my hands on my hair, or wash them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I like how my hair looks when I'm done styling.  It's a good product.
B000U2AQNY|5|This is really good for very dry hair, but you only need a tiny bit rubbed on your hands and then lightly touch your hair.  A little goes a long way.
B0009R5BZS|5|I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I PURCHASED AN ADDITION ONE AFTER THE 2 I FIRST BOUGHT NOW I HAVE 3 PLUS 2 TUBES OF IT. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOLVE IT!!! IT MAKES MY HAIRR LOOK HEALTHY.
B00P9PIG7U|4|Have not used it very long but am happy so far with the positive effect it has on the skin and nails.
B006U98T08|4|I'm 12 and I love makeup I ordered them and I love them so much BEST BRUSHES EVER IN THE WORLD
B000PQGYOU|4|I like this plate holder it works well when scraping the extra polish from the image plate. Very nice.<br />Thank You
B000GCV4IY|5|Great stuff. I have dry scalp and this conditioning shampoo takes care of the dryness.
B00AWRGYNI|5|great shampoo good for the scalp as well as hair, recommended by my dermatologist
B0002NXR32|5|This is exactly what I needed. I used to use the Bumble and Bumble Hair Powder. I was really annoyed when they discontinued it to make a new and improved product. The new Bumble and Bumble product is awful. Wet, sticky and does nothing for my hair and gets all over clothes.    This Sephora Hair powder is great. I have long thick hair and hate washing, drying with a round brush everyday. It's time consuming. This product takes out any grease and revives your hair. I just brush my hair add a little hair powder and run a curling iron through it for a little volume. I don't even squeeze the bottle I just shake it and it comes out in small amounts. It is white and shows against dark hair, but you can fluff it through with your fingers. My hair lightens up ever so slightly. Not bad at all.     I really love this product and am happy it's out. I hope they keep it out forever. Best $28.00 I ever spent! The powder lasts a long time.
B000C1UBR4|5|Love the smell of this classic scent on my hubby!  This scent never goes out of style. Delicious! Love it!
B003AKZCQE|5|This is the first finger nail clipper I have used, that cut my nails with a perfect edge. Usually I have to turn the nail clipper upside-down to get a nice looking and smooth edge on the nails. This one does the job and I get rid of most of the white edge of the nails, without getting too close to my nail roots. I have a good grip on it and I don't have to sweat to cut harder nails. I am in total charge. You will see and feel the great quality on this Seki Edge nail clipper as soon as you open the package. It stands out on its own.<br /><br />Not that this finger nail clipper would not do the job on my toes, but I also bought Seki Edge toe nail clipper. That one has the same great quality, but is larger in size and more suitable for toe nails. It covers a larger area and you save time :-)
B005GDAZBK|5|We love this shampoo and can't find it always where we live so we will order this through Amazon from now on and let our fingers do the walking!
B00264NW7G|3|So so
B0085CYW36|3|Got exposed to this soap during a trip to the UK and loved it simplicity, the smell, and the cool logo embedded/a fixed to the bar (the latter gives it a little something extra) - a real classic. I use it all the time, glad I can order it online without having to wait to my next trip to the UK for refills!<br /><br />Dr. Terrence E. Maltbia, New York, USA
B001ECQ4RG|5|I have had bad skin my whole life and tried everything. A friend of mine mentioned how awesome ponds has been for a deep cleaning whenever she breaks out so I thought \\"Why not? What's another product?\\"<br /><br />Well I was so surprised that this product could be used without water and still clean better than the traditional cleansing method.  My breakouts are pretty much non-existent except once a month when the hormones go crazy, but it is no where near as bad as it used to be. The product smells great and leaves my skin moisturized enough that I do not need any other products.<br /><br />I use this product morning and night and pair it with Neutrogena Skin Clearing Makeup and my skin feels more under control.  I highly recommend to those who have tried everything.  It is a small investment that might just work for you too
B00JTY6WQ4|4|I like the product It was well worth it.
B005G7QJY8|5|The product was authentic and carefully wrapped. I have no complaints at all and plan on ordering some more again.
B004JY1W96|5|Quick as a Flash Delivery.<br />Excellent communication from the Seller.<br />Product just as described!<br />Yummy Yummy smell and applies sooo smoothly...<br />Love this-<br />I will definitely purchase from this Seller again!
B001FLHYM0|5|Great Bargain. I love Bare Mineral products. Foundation goes on light, it doesn't have that heavy greasy feel that you get with liquid coverup. You apply it you look like you've been out in the sun getting a great tan.  Looks and feels GREAT
B00GM4G6XI|4|I have very fine wavy hair. This shampoo works very well adding lots of body.
B003S516XO|2|doesnst work at all. i got this because I love remington products, but it doesnt heat up. wish i could send it back. when it heats up, it smells awful. very cheap.
B001TXVZP6|5|Really like this product. Everything arrived as planned. Very happy with the purchase. Thank you. Happy Holiday. Will order in the future.
B00C675A8W|2|The color is ok but I dont like the fact that it has glitter in it, when I applied to my face it kinda comes out pale and I have caramel/medium colored skin and when done, you see shiny glittery affects I preferred it to be just translucent and solid colored.
B0049LUI9O|1|These things suck!! I should have listened to the review that were written on them before I purchased them. They worked perfectly for the first couple of months then just stopped working from one day to the next. I thought the batteries were dead so I changed them out. To my dismay the damned thing still wouldn't work. Going to see if I could get my money back. What a rip off!
B006Z79SBE|1|It goes on very smoothly but whatever toxic chemicals they are using in it to make it glide on so smoothly made my eyelids swell up drastically and I've never had an allergic reaction to make up!
B00OSUUP9O|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B003V37ZDS|5|I admit that while the design of these shaver had caught my postive attention at first, the purchase price dissuaded me from making the purchase. Recently, after consistently bad shaves with my current shaver, I decided to \\"bite the bullet.\\" Wow, am I impressed! I regret now ever having waited. The manual says it can take up to 21 days for your beard and skin to become used to this shaver, so one should be patient about being satisfied with the initial shaves. My first shave had my face feeling like a babies bottom. It probably took me about a minute to complete the shave. The clean up of the shaver was easy as could be. You simply pop the shaver heads up on their hinge and run warm water through the heads and the well which collects the whiskers. Other positives is that the shaver is very easy to hold with a very light weight. A full charge does take just about an hour as described in the manual. There are several indicator lights on the shaver guiding you when to replace the shaver heads, when to recharge the shave, and when the shaver needs to be cleaned. I would do a TV commercial for this shaver.
B004BUEIQC|5|I discovered this lotion at the tanning place I go to and asked if the lotions they sell are any better than the ones at the drug store.  They recommended Pandora lotion so I bought a bottle and paid $65 for it.  It really was a terrific lotion but their price was not affordable.  I looked up this lotion on the internet and was directed to Amazon and was thrilled to see it at 1/3 the price I pad at the tanning salon.  It gives me a beautiful even tan and has cut my tanning time in half.  I think this lotion is the best!!!
B0061DPB04|5|My daughter (age 10) bought this and thinks it makes her hair soft and has gotten longer. I have noticed the conditioning effect, not so much the length. Will purchase again.
B003XV2QAU|3|It worked ok the first time, but tried it a second time and it didn't.
B007O7AZBG|5|I heard this face brush was awesome, so I had to get my hands on it. I recieved it in perfect condition.
B0020MMB7Q|5|Great, perfume,  and amazon.com is Just The best!
B000V9DO4Y|5|I ordered this after trying some in New Zealand. It smells great, feels great, looks great, and doesn't make my face look shiny or oily. I like it better than some much more expensive products I've used. I use the SPF15 moisturizer, the night cream, and the eye cream, and will order more when they run out.
B0019ZZFJ6|3|my husband doesn't use it
B00K32VXTW|5|I have been using this product for about 6 months and my face and skin feels great. The fine lines have started to diminish and I get many complements on how beautiful my skin is. Thanks. Correne
B00EJFW9XS|5|These are cute, inexpensive, well made, and versatile.  Love that I was able to save so much money by purchasing them online.
B000RZR16Y|5|This is my favorite all-over sunblock, as I have very sensitive skin and most products make my skin break out. It's not at all oily and doesn't have an offensive odor, either.
B004F949V8|1|This is not a matte. It is just a mess. Don't bother. Spend a few extra bucks and get a real matte polish.
B003AT2ZCY|5|OMG! OMG! OMG! this is the real shizz, its a fantastic highlight color for black girls, doesnt give the ashy look that banana does.
B00163G266|5|Great product craftsmanship material is realistic life like to the touch  and does not have hardly any rubber smell like others do..<br />would recommend to anyone ho is interested in additional toys for women...<br />Thanks good product....
B0000YUXI0|1|One of my sons picked up nail biting when he was bored. I bought this product knowing that it would taste awful, but I had no idea it was THIS bad. This is a horrible product! It works incredibly fast, but is too hard on children. If you still want to try this product, test it out on yourself first. Every food item you/your child handles without a utensil will taste like a combination of earwax and rubbing alcohol. EVERYTHING!!! It doesn't just stay on your nails. Children should enjoy the food they ingest. It is an absolutely horrible product.
B00MNBAB4O|5|I love this stuff .I have very noticeable pimples on my jaw line I used this,by the next day the majority of them were gone also it made my face very soft . It does have kinda a strong oder of seaweed ,  but I didn't mind it. Just make sure you follow the directions and don't go over the time limit :)
B00BQUAMP6|4|The containers are about the size of a quarter in diameter and a few in thickness - similar to little Oreos. You get maybe a good 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of each acrylic powder color, which is expected for the price you're paying. So far, I like the consistency and variety it gives me for my acrylic nails.<br /><br />For those that might not know, these are concentrated colors. You can directly use them as is for nail tips or 3D art, but if you're hoping to cover an entire nail with the color, then I suggest mixing them together with clear acrylic powder so you don't get to the third nail and realize you ran out of powder.
B00KRDSJZ8|5|I LOVE this perfume!! I receive it earlier than what they told me I would. It was packaged really well. I would definitely recommend this time my friends! Great company.
B001EJVG18|2|This came in looking like it was used. It had scratches and hand marks all over. I was expecting it to be brand new but i guess not. However, the shipping was very fast and that was greatly appreciated.
B00VQTHLGA|5|This has saved us!  My kids all got braces VERY young.  8 and 9 years old.  Of course, flossing is difficult for kids without braces, with them it's darn near impossible.  Oh, the fights we had!  Until we found these.  They fit behind the wire!!!!  So much easier than the threader ones.  And I know it's saving them from cavities later on, so it's so worth the money.  We love them!  Be warned, not all brands fit behind braces.  These are GREAT!!!
B005EM895W|5|Love it smells great
B0002Z8OUQ|5|This is the tweezer I always use. It is sharp and the slant means I have a large surface and don't have to be exact to catch a hair.  This is a spare.
B001U8L104|2|I wanted soap that smelled like Verbena without having to pay a million dollars for SOAP - this smells more like lemon - my boyfriend likes it because it's kind of a deodorant soap - cheap and smells sorta like it - but not what I expected
B004TIASPG|5|super cute and great for cosmetic's with a plastic liner i love it and would like to get another one sometime
B004I6J3K0|4|I love this perfume! But when I purchased it I was waiting for 2 weeks and still didn't recieve it. I then decided to send an email to the sender asking where it is. She didn't bother to tell me that it was out of stock and they are refunding my money. I was disappointed, they are quick to take your money but trying to get a refund took some time.
B009N5HWQI|5|I really like this
B001GV2P3C|5|This is an excellent product and is useful especially for folks who frequently get cuts or who don't feel good after shaving. I simply love this product. The only limitation is that this is not easily available in stores where they sell American Crew products.
B000FFT8KS|5|Love this cleanser! It makes my skin so soft. I have really sensitive skin so it's taken me awhile to find a face wash gentle enough so that I don't break out.
B00AQ8NIC8|1|I purchased this product for the name alone. I use the Total Repair Extreme 5 for a few heating tool split ends and am satisfied with that system. My ends are moisturized and not so damaged looking. I used this in conjunction with the above mentioned and was not satisfied at all.   My hair was flat, oily looking, felt waxy, heavy, dull with a matte appearance  To be a rinse after 3-5 minutes treatment, I hoped that my hair would have looked healthy. The jar was so cumbersome especially if using in the shower. I returned this after (2) uses. $8 Rite Aid.
B00FCCFVTQ|2|I haven't noticed a difference.
B00KHGJTPE|1|I returned this product because it looks cheap quality not worth the money I paid.
B000IAK2NW|4|Wasn't expecting much, but it does exactly what I need it to, which is to clean out the hairs from my electrical Wahl head shaver. I used it once so far and no issues. Bristles stayed intact so far. If 2 of these last me a year, I'll be more than happy with the purchase. Wasn't that expensive.
B003KJBGGU|5|Nice soft toothbrushes for babies.  Very good quality.
B00D76IR3G|5|Soft and excelent for my bronzer!
B00B0F3NO4|1|Didn't work for me, hair just got very dry and  left a residue in my scalp, had to wash hair every day for few days in a role to get rid of it. I did follow the instructions.
B005GQ6HUK|3|I'm usually a fan of garnier frutis products, but this one is ...eh..<br />I have very curly hair. Mix between spiral and loose curls. Can be VERY frizzy and dry.<br /><br />Pros: smells freaking AWESOME. Leaves hair smelling good Till next wash. Cheap. You get a lot of product. Cut down SOME frizz?<br /><br />CONS: weighed hair down. Made hair feel waxy. Didn't really notice any SLEEKness.<br /><br />Overall. Didn't like this product. Didn't do what it said and left my hair feeling waxy and gross.<br />Very light frizz control. Looks better than going without ANYTHING, but didn't do anything spectacular.<br />However, I will use this up because it smells amazing. I suppose just use LESS product to cut down on the waxy feel.
B005GHP5UC|5|This is a great product. I break out from everything, not this.  I use it on hair face body. All natural, faint smell.   I hate stinky stuff and this is not at all. Won't even notice it.
B001AMSAAY|5|They work great! I love having a variety of curler sizes to choose from.  Having less clips then rollers is ok for me. I'll never have 30 rollers (thus needing 30 clips) in my hair at the same time.  And u can always order more clips seperately.  There is also a lid for this product.  (You can't tell from the pics or description)
B003FBI9LS|5|We all love this waver!  Adjustable heat for our different hair types!!  Highly recommend
B001AN0YR0|4|It was really easy to apply. The color is great. I wish it had more then one mixing cup, so I could just toss the used one.
B00BBA4LZI|4|I was totally pleased with this purchase and will be purchasing again.  It gave my skin a nice powder matte finish.  I have extremely oily skin and its rare to find a product that can do this for me.
B002YPLK58|5|Epicuren is simply the best lotion for dry skin, particularly in the winter months.  It is smooth, but not greasy and smells wonderful.
B00NV9KLXS|2|This is the second in-shower lotion I've tried and I think I've given up on the idea altogether. It doesn't moisturize your skin, plain and simple. It just leaves a thin film or coat of product on your skin, but your skin feels just as dry as before. It's a nice idea and they got me to try it two different times, but it's just a gimmick. I've used regular Nivea body lotion before, so I know that it's a decent moisturizer. This product does not compare at all. Save your money.
B0054Y2EJ2|5|I would definitely recommend keratin treatment to every women, doesn't matter if your hair is curly or straight because the keratin not only removes the frizz, but also conditions your hair for many weeks. You will see a difference after one use and you would want to repeat the treatment. I have done one at the salon but because the prices were high, I just ordered the keratin treatment and did it at home. I got the same results, so why overpay?
B00NR4BIZM|4|This might be a 5 if my under eye circles would improve more.....perhaps they will improve a bit in time.  The product has a lovely feel and absorbs into the skin very well!  I would certainly buy it again and would recommend it.  Service is excellent!
B002BAOMAG|1|This smells awful! It actually smells like a cross between scented baby wipes and BO. I wish I could return this product. The lemon vanilla scent is so much better.
B004BCVB10|5|Love it, just as described
B002CSFZ2Q|2|The price of this item was really high for the amount of product so I have say I would not purchase again
B004LMIE88|3|Nice cream, not too greasy. Sinks into skin. Just half through the bottle and not sure if it makes a dsifference but if you need an spf-15 it is a great product.
B00AKS2208|4|The color is lovely and very similar to the box. I think it looks nice.
B0015TI2ZA|5|My husband has to wear pain patches and this is the only thing I have found that acutally works and keeps patch on for the 7 days!! Great stuff, will buy again.
B00133QGZ6|5|great
B008MIRP9G|4|It looks so real, just like my grand mom - mom. We look like twins. Im so happy with it.
B002ZG8DG0|5|Love this lotion it smells delicious
B00BBFR3RQ|5|Love this BB cream by pacifica. I try to use only natural skincare and this stuff is great! It has reasonable coverage, the tint always matches to my skin, and it gives you a nice glow. I set it with translucent powder and put some blush on with it. Makes makeup fast and easy. As long as I don't sweat a bunch it stays on all day. Will be using this product for a long time!
B00CNLEN8Y|5|I've tried many no named &#34;compare to&#34; products but I keep coming back to this.  This is head and shoulders above the competition.
B00EYZY6AC|5|Best product ever. I love the vanilla smell and my hair looks so good after using it. It left my hair shiny and smooth. It hasn't looked this good in a long time. Thanks Influenster for the complimentary product to try out in my voxbox!
B000N2JKJM|5|Love this product.  It makes your hair feel thicker, without being too heavy.  Hair is much more manageable. Apply to wet hair & it makes styling much more effective.  Great product & I highly recommend, especially for hair that needs a boost of volume that lasts.
B00GLCFN62|4|The first thing you should do when you receive this item is to wash it to get rid of the dye. Mine came with a little instruction telling me I should wash it first before wearing. I've now had a chance to wear this item a couple of times now. This item is very soft and comfortable and I hardly notice I even had it on. However, if you sleep on your side or stomach, better fasten the band a little tighter so the eye mask stays on your head and doesn't let light in. I sleep on my back so this doesn't bother me. However, there's a reason this gets 4 stars and not 5. 1. It does let some light in where the noise piece is. This didn't bother me as when I closed my eyes, I didn't even notice. The one thing that kind of bother me is the band is connected by Velcro. Because of this, I can feel a little bump in the back of my head. You'll eventually get used to it but you'll always know it's there. Overall a nice and comfortable product. I haven't had any black eyes yet but I did hand wash it and ran it under water for several minutes until what I rung out was clear water and not grayish looking.
B002LFLVFK|3|DID NOT SEE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. ITS HARD TO TAKE OFF, MAKE SURE YOU BUY AN OIL REMOVER, .  I DID NOT LIKE THAT FACT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE.  I JUST BOUGHT AND OIL MAKEUP REMOVER, MAYBE THAT WILL MAKE  DIFFERENCE.
B009UW1CQK|3|I order these loose individual crystals to create my own design, was shipped the \\"I'm yours\\" pack instead. I'm going to have to go to the beauty supply store to get loose crystals.
B000K90C3Q|4|This is a very good nght cream.  It works to keep sun damaged skin clear and moist.As I live in Arizona, it is constantly necessary to fight damage from the sun.
B0088BWHGS|3|Smells different than I expected
B002RN7N62|5|Love it and affordable. Use it almost everyday. This would last me about a month or so. Would recommend everyone to buy this.
B0001MROQA|5|Everytime I curl my hair with this iron all I get are compliments.  The 1 1/2 inch curls make one feel so glamorous and the curls last all day long.  It only takes a few minutes and the least bit of effort to achieve the style youre looking for.  The heating time on this product is so efficient and each curl comes out perfect.  This is my second Helen of Troy product, I trust in the brand and will continue to purchase it's products.
B009WXPVJG|5|This oil is very lightweight and works wonders!  You only need &#34;one or two&#34; pumps for your hair so it tends to last a long time...it's NOT greasy.
B002CVTVUA|1|I wad not expecting a Philips product would fail in less than a year! The Oral-B for adults did not have problem for several years. Don't know if they have kid's type.
B00LXHCFR0|4|Like it seems to be helping
B00JJQ7342|5|as expected
B005XS37QS|5|Exactly what I wanted and ordered.
B00008LUOY|5|I am way past the teenage year but still have occasional breakouts. I have tried all kinds of face wash but none of them worked as well as this brand.  It really makes your skin clear if you use it frequently and it won't dry your skin. I highly recommend this product.
B000XB6OVU|5|[[ASIN:B0012RXW1O Paris Hilton By Paris Hilton For Women. Set-eau De Parfum Spray 3.3-Ounces & Body Lotion 3-Ounces & Shower Gel 3-Ounces & Parfum Spray .25-Ounces Mini]]
B00286QVBQ|5|I usually take this one, everywhere I go, most of the colors are very similar to the amkeupshop sunset coleltion, but you still have many choices to choose from, blushers are for medium colors, or actually for light to medium. I like the design and quality is just great.
B009OU6LWS|5|Although some users express disappointment w/ Scotch, I really like it. You do have to apply it correctly. I went to Scotch Naturals website to see if there were different instructions on how to apply it since this is the first time I have used water-based polish. They recommend applying before bed so it can \\"cure\\" overnight. It dries to the touch amazingly fast.<br /><br />I always buff my nails, apply base coat, 2-3 coats of color and 1-2 of top coat, and voila!! My nails are good for 3-4 days. But since I'm ready for a change at that point, and I always like to let my nails \\"breathe\\" in between paintings, that period of time is fine for me. I can't understand how someone would want the same color on their nails for days or weeks on end; besides, it's kind of a therapeutic, calming ceremony to paint my nails: I consider it \\"color therapy.\\"<br /><br />I have used top brands in the past--Mac, Chanel, Dior, Clinique--as well as some of the so-called \\"natural\\" brands like BB Couture and Karma Organics, and no nail polish I've ever used looks good after day 4. Not unless you're the queen of England and the only thing you use your hands for is to wave to your loyal subjects. Anyone who thinks nail polish will look fabulous after 4 days is living in a fantasy world: there's just no way--at least never in my experience.<br /><br />Another really good thing about this polish: if I slop a little onto the skin around my nails, it comes right off my fingers in the shower! No need to do time-consuming cleanup like with regular nail  polish.<br /><br />I don't know if this makes any difference, but I keep my nails very short, and when I paint them, I USE COMMON SENSE. In other words, I am careful about wearing gloves to do dishes, I keep them as dry as I can, and I don't do things that I know will mess up my nails.<br /><br />I give Scotch Naturals 10 stars: the colors are unique and pure, there is no odor and no toxins. Nothing makes me happier than this final point: I refuse to sacrifice my health.<br /><br />Make sure your nails are 100% clean before applying polish; do it at night and allow to cure. FOLLOW SCOTCH'S DIRECTIONS. THIS IS DIFFERENT STUFF!! One time I painted in the morning, let it dry, exposed my gloved hands to hot water and the polish peeled right off my nails.to sacrifice my health.<br /><br />Make sure your nails are 100% clean before applying polish; do it at night and allow to cure.

B005C1C02S|5|thank you guys.you guys are awesome. my wife like your products and I will buy more stuff in near feature.
B002IJ7X1A|4|good comb
B003AJLQ5Q|5|I owned the Sedu Pro before this one. I loved the Pro but this one is even better at straighting my natural curly hair.It is lighter and really straightens quickly given it is a 1&#34; and my Pro was a 1 and 1/2&#34;.
B00065IBKK|2|Big noise. Easy to hurt the hair
B00145WKZ8|5|Use it on dry feet for smooth results. But do it over a trash can... This removes a serious amount of dead skin!
B00011QUDE|5|My daughter specified exactly what she wanted, even sent me the order code via e-mail, so she and I both got exactly what she wanted for Christmas with the greatest of ease for me.
B001MIZMIE|5|This cream works great. I have tried many and this is the best and fastest working cream, I would highly recommend this cream
B00FULYKG4|5|Takes a little time to get used to it but what a life saver!
B00CB83VSW|4|These tools are great, but my whiteheads were too small to pop. I only could get one which worked instantly.
B006GCT0KC|5|The best aftershave i ever used
B00DWPTLYQ|3|This came from China registered mail.  It took forever to get the post office to redeliver the item.  It was pretty, but not worth the time and effort it took calling and waiting for it to be delivered.  The post office has a special cage for registered items and evidently the carrier failed to check the cage.  I had to call the supervisor of the post office to get it delivered.<br />It was given as a gift and the person who received it seemed pleased.  I thought it was a little too heavy for most people with thinner hair.  Great if you have thick heavy hair.
B0062IWQVU|4|I recently was given a Fusion ProGlide Styler by Gillette and like the product for its ease of use and portability.  The Styler worked well as long as the hair isn't too thick that you are cutting.  I have thick hair and had to keep unclogging it when I was using the lowest setting guard.  Once I used the longest guard and worked down, it was a better cut and less clog.  If I keep up with the Styler, then it works great and is easy to use.  It comes with three length settings and a great carrying case that holds everything.  It has a sleek design and a comfortable grip with the power button easy to find while shaving.  I would have given it a five if it was a little bigger for chest and arm shaving.  It works great for neck and beard shaving.
B0058AGBYG|5|I was tired of breaking out from waxing and tried this on a whim. It works great and does not irritate my skin. Takes 6-8 minutes, painless, not particularly smelly. I highly recommend it & will keep using it.
B00AG4KI6Q|5|I love the smell! :D and it arrived super quick!
B008SCLQAK|3|Read the description carefully. It is NOT a human hair wig, just human hair quality. This means it's human hair mixed with synthetic hair. Also, it's not full lace. There is lace at the front and back. It is a nice-looking wig, though.
B00GM3G6ZW|5|As a working mother, I can't appreciate products like this enough. It's fast, it's easy, and it's effective. It's also a great value. It's a real money saver that you can get more than 20 washes out of these sponges. Even without the cellulite-diminishing benefits, this sponge packs a lot of power. It keeps up a great lather and doesn't rip like other sponges after many uses. I'm about to pass 15 washes with my sponge and it works as great as the first time I used it.<br /><br />The Grapefruit scent is very pleasing, and it does give an aromatherapy effect. The sponge lathers pretty nicely, so I don't feel like they skimped out on the amount of cream which is good.<br />Durability is great, as I described before. The sponge itself feels nice against the skin, and the textured side doesn't 'go soft' after a few uses. Performing the 'Lipo-Massage' with the textured side feels really relaxing, and you can actually rub pretty hard without damaging the sponge. After only a couple weeks, I've noticed some of my more troubling areas have cleared up a little. This is very reassuring to me. I plan to use the sponge through week 8 and see what happens.
B00OINO73Q|5|Brushes are Great ⭐️
B001B1Q9DE|4|Many of Annick Goutal's florals are very light and fleeting, and Neroli is no exception.  Annick Goutal uses a relatively high proportion of natural ingredients and many of the florals have that pure, evanescent, natural quality because they are not anchored with heavy base notes.  Therefore they do not linger.  Comparing a fragrance like this to something with tons of presence and lasting power would be like disparaging a madeleine because it doesn't have the heavy moist deep flavor and mouth feel of a chocolate fudge brownie.  There's room in our lives for many different kinds of fragrances.  If you are alright with its fleeting quality, this is one of the loveliest summer scents.  Not fair to expect it to be Shalimar.
B005NQS5LW|1|I love Philosophy and I love Amazing Grace. However, this product fell short. It smells like nothing : (  Try again Philosophy. I still love you.
B004MJXTC6|5|My boyfriend loved this with the container and all when I got it for a stalking stuffer It's a good scent and i like supporting small business. get it for the guy in your life - he'll enjoy it!
B000NGD1MA|3|Nearing six weeks, and have seen some improvement.  I am hoping that by 8 weeks I will see more improvement.
B00AA4BRK8|5|I love this lipstick! I used to use Lancome, but I do prefer a natural looking. This Peach Vanilla color is perfect. First I applied 2 layers according to other customer review, but later I found that 1 layer is ok with me too. And the color stays until I get off from work (most of the days).  Highly recommanded.
B003ZFS4KU|5|Fast shipping , great product
B00BFW3NNI|5|Has a rich lavender scent, nice to rub on before going to bed.
B00AKKX4DU|5|Received my package today. I found out I'm allergic to chemical fragrance and I have missed wearing perfume. I was excited to find something affordable that had more natural ingredients. I will post an update if it causes any allergic reactions like normal perfumes have done.<br /><br />The Vanilla Coconut is my favorite. It's clean and sweet. The Pure Vanilla smells good but kind of reminds me of a perfume from the 80's that my aunt wore. Its a little more musky, and musk is not my favorite, but it does have a more expensive perfume smell. The Vanilla Grapefruit has a sweet/citrus scent and I'm looking forward to trying it.
B000WHTLKQ|5|Wonderful smelling candle and massage oil! I just thought this was going to be another candle that would not smell as good as it's supposed to, well this candle is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of a great scent! The lavender is relaxing and calming, I put this in my room as soon as I received it, how awesome! Not only did I use it for the relaxing smell of lavender, I also convinced my hubby to give me a massage with some of the oil that was produced from burning the candle! All i can say are great things about this French Lavender All natural massage oil and candle, by Greenfire! It was so relaxing and calming, I slept over 8 hours that night! Normally I only sleep around 5/6 hours, so that is amazing what this candle can do for you, your body and mind! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to achieve a relaxing sleep all night, I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.
B0013IESPG|5|I love this product.  I've used it consistently since July and have found that it's softened and smoothed out rough skin that I've been battling for years.  The scent is unique (and just a little strong when you first open the jar), but it doesn't overpower at all - I usually can't use highly scented lotions, but this product doesn't offend.  I'll definitely repurchase!
B00U1S3MVK|5|excellent ,the wife likes it alot so i may get her the ladies version
B003FBI9LS|5|Love it my hair looks great and easy to use!
B002QY86BI|3|Found this nail buffer to give you an acceptable shine when you don't have the time for polish.  I liked it so much I bought 3 more.
B00197623M|4|Great brush.  I should have bought the 9-row but this one was did the trick.
B001MP0T2Q|4|I bought this brush to finally teach myself how to do a perfect smile line. Let me just say, it's way easier to do it on your toes than it is to do it on your hands. I'm still practicing though! The brush is made well and has lasted thus far.
B002JK1DNC|4|I was surprised to see this in the store so I bought several bars.  It's a really nice soap with what feels like bits of oatmeal so it has a pleasant exfoliation factor.  However, while it smells like citrus, there is no discernible honeysuckle scent at all.  It should be called Citrus Honeysuckle, not the other way around.
B0020MMBQC|5|Ok, so you might think this is an &#34;old&#34; fragrance, but I love it and I was tired of spending $100 on it at Nordstrom. It's the real deal and a great value.
B008AVFWHM|4|gave 4 stars. Some products out there work better. However this one is pretty good. have thin fine short hair.. This product works well if you are trying to grow your hair out or are in between hair cuts. Spray on and then put hair into place just the way you want it. works like a light hold wax but better. Just wish it had more hold because I have to finish with a hairspray. The kms hairplay  dry wax has a better hold and don't need to follow up with hairspray...
B001XURHM0|1|I bought this because Esquire reviewed it and made it sound great - replacing the Red solo cup.  Hardly... you can't even fit an ice cube in this it is so small.  So disappointed.
B0054Y2F9Q|5|I love this stuff!  It really holds the style.  I have an undercut pixie so this paste is great!  Great hold, pliable if you don't use too much.
B000H15N3G|5|good
B00AZIZHU0|5|Very good shampoo.  I buy in different variations just for a fun.  We all need it, right?  Smells very well and lives the hair soft.  I always buy the shampoo and the conditioner together.  Works great for me.
B003V32UE2|4|razor and cleaning system great. detachable trimmer leaves a lot to be desired, poor design on a well thought out razor. its like bolting a brass horn on a fine stringed instrument, usable but not very functionable. paying that much for a razor i expect a trimmer that does'nt look and feel like a 50 cent add on.
B00J2APP5O|3|color didnt look red hot was ok through
B00FQCQ5AG|1|Stickers are too small  don't stick  waste of money
B000GIOCC8|5|I was referred to purchase this product by a beauty YOUTube'er and she was so right! It is the perfect summer scent.

B00SNXT5OI|4|[[VIDEOID:9ffd36a8e4e6a131a259c93d32ccbd6c]] ACEVIVI 180 Piece Eye shadow Pallet,<br /><br />Here is my video review for the 180 piece eye shadow product.<br /><br />This pallet comes with 180 individual eye shadows colors that range from soft to vibrant. It is in cased in hard plastic with a convenient vanity mirror built in. You can't go wrong with this variety of colors. I recommend this product to keep for yourself or as a gift. The only thing I would suggest is that the individual pallets should be able to swivel because when you open the side ones the individual shadows fall out of the casing.
B002NYERPU|5|I don't color my hair, but I do have super curly hair that I keep super curly. Some squirts of this stuff through my hair and it stays soft and touchable all day, plus I now have women telling me they love how my hair smells. Double bonus!
B00CIV006I|4|Arrived really early so that was a plus. It is a little hard to fit around blow dryer and it blows off my head thats the only negatives.
B00MWW74FS|5|love this, works great, couldn't be more pleased
B001P0MWY6|1|I bought this shampoo to help with my dry scalp. It dried out my hair so badly and the next day my scalp was 10x worse than it was before I used the shampoo. Only upside is that it doesn't smell as bad. Back to T/Gel for me.
B008S0U3RO|5|Have used many, many concealers love this one. Texture is perfect, gives the coverage I need and want. Does not disappear or look out of place. My daughter tried it when she was here visiting and she also loved it.
B00RY4X0WU|4|great bottles for making your own hand soap
B003983I1S|4|Love these blades but they are super expensive everywhere - even here if you ask me!  But this was best price anywhere.  Much cheaper than brick & mortar in my area.
B0045CE0S2|1|The needles were packaged properly and on first look they were fine but the \\"liner\\" grouping is horrible they are between a liner and a shader i thought that maybe they were mislabled but comparing them to a 9rs they arent the same they almost ruined some work i was doing. do not order needles from this company.
B000E7STWK|3|I used to buy all of my cologne on Amazon, but reading peer reviews now I am second guessing my decision. I love the pricing that is offered, but question the authenticity of the cologne. What I have received has always smelled correct, however after a few reviewers pointed out, the potency seems to be lack luster and not last.
B00845QG60|5|OPI is the best polish on the market and the minis make it possible to try so many and not have leftover polish.
B00BDM80ZQ|5|fits great!
B004ZULKE6|5|This stuff is amazing. I would purchase it over and over again! I'll definitely be purchasing a full size bottle very soon
B0002XG9X2|3|Decided to try product b/c I didn't need an exfoliator, just something to help clear pore issues especially on my nose & between the eyebrows on my forehead.  After first use, I did notice the difference on my nose. It appeared cleaner & you can see the residue on the suction cups.  Be careful not to hold in one spot too long-it may result in some broken capillaries.  You must keep it moving along.  I used it without the mist option-just kept face moist with water on the areas I was working on.
B001TSLWL8|5|Decent smell, and not too slimy with soft-water.  I bought this soap because it is what I had before, and I did not feel like going to the store to get it.
B00PV15BPW|4|Used a homemade recipe to kill spiders with this oil and it worked!  There was a huge spider dead between my door and screen where I had sprayed.  So glad I found this way to stop them coming into my home.
B00U5L399S|5|A pleasant return to the world of DE razors.
B001EP5YBA|4|Good deal!
B00MWHDIE4|5|Bottom line my skin is clear and smooth
B005PLQGUC|2|I was under the impression that these were 8 oz tubes not two 4 oz tubes. I wouldn't purchase these again for that reason. It doesn't seem like a great deal for two small tubes. I quickly read the item description so maybe it was in there and I missed it...
B003UH0528|5|This brush is excellent! I've always thought MAC brushes were the best, but after trying this one, I am sold! Excellent material used, really blends your liquid foundation precisely, and easy to clean.
B006GQYSDC|5|Great
B00K2CRAYK|5|Wow!! Speechless!! I drink lots of water, get my sleep and I still have some dark circles. After one treatment of this it suddenly vanished! Couldn't be happier. Will be ordering over and over again. :-)
B008HCVY3K|2|I have a few small red spots from acne and the product did not have any affect on them... For acne after i statrted using the product redness may have been reduced? Hard to tell... I had higher hopes for the product effectivness. This was expensive. I will try other products in hopes of somthing that really works.
B0028CX8FW|5|I use this mask as part of my weekly facial hydration routine, but I dont expect miracles. For the price, this mask is a great value. The mask is very generously soaked in the serum. It took an hour to dry out completely. There is enough serum left in the bag for me to apply to my neck and decollete. The sheet is larger than the other masks I am used to. It goes beyond my hairline and jaw line, which is great because I can fold the sheet over and wrap the jaw line which is the area that I overlook the most. My skin feels smooth and soft afterwards.  I will recommend this mask as part of skin hydration routine. It really does the job.
B00L2NG7NS|5|Works great for me.  Have been using it on a scar.
B0068YUBCE|5|amazinggg i love his palette! the colors are beautiful! this palette is mixed with matte and shimmery colors, colors are very good, they blend out very smoothly, i used the matte brown to contour my face, and the light ivory colors the highlight my face, it looks bigger in pictures but the size is really good, and the palette it self is very light weight. very good buy for the price, loving it!
B00FH3DWAU|5|Great amount for a great price! If everyone used natural products like this, the world would be a better place!
B003V32UE2|5|im a young guy and i travel alot, i use this whenever i travel and it works great i dont bring the jet cleaner with me because its big but you dont need to jet clean it every day this razor has been across the country and all over and still works great i love how i can wet or dry shave with this its super cool no tug or sensitivity with this and it opens easy to get rid of hair and charge lasts me for a week trip i was on a 3 week trip and it lasted me right up to the end useing it every other day it is a good razor
B003I3NEZ4|5|Works wonders!!!
B00HCRDS4O|5|Love it. Works great and the price is good.
B000XE8EWE|1|It does,not have a pump for applications. Liquid only.
B00KQASCDG|5|I love shea butter, it's great on dry, winter skin.  I've had both the yellow and the white shea butter, and I like the white better.  I will order again.
B00MJ0N6FA|5|I really like this eyelash curler!  It presses your lashes gently and it doesn't pinch or hurt your eyelids. I recommend it!
B007YT34S0|4|expensive and overpriced. but comfortable and long lasting
B00ILCCUN4|5|Fantastic little bottles. They work well! I share my oils with friends and loved ones with zero problems.
B00AHH00R4|5|Good quality product that lasts for hours.  It does not have a strong odor, just about right.  Plan to buy this again.
B003UJHSUI|4|This stuff works. Try it to believe.
B0019RRBFK|2|I guess you get what you paid for not very happy with this product the bristles were all bent straight out of the package! Not cool I guess I'm not to mad cuz I didn't spend a crazy amount of money on it! But I won't be buying from this seller any more! Lesson learned!
B004FPPVV4|5|Lasts all day. Beautiful colors, very girly :)
B001QX80WA|5|Excellent product, it is very important for skin care ... Do not use other brands. It is a good quality product, recognized in the market and a good price.
B00D3G6JAS|3|Do not use long term - makes teeth sensitive!
B00M76UR94|2|The color of this blush is way too dark for me.  This really isn't any fault of the seller or the product.  I guess I should have known better than to try and buy something like this online when the color obviously is of great importance -- you can't expect a picture online to be very accurate color-wise.   I learned my lesson, this was a waste of money for me.
B008LE5EIK|3|Not as heavy on the menthol as I would have liked, and the eucalyptus is much more prevalent than expected.  The overall scent is more herbal.  As far as performance, it goes on very lightweight and does disappear fairly quickly leaving my freshly shaved skin feeling fairly soft. I'll use this tub, but will probably not replace it.
B00D0JEBQM|5|I haven't used the cones yet But the Mani Pedi Callus Remover works great. I am unable to bend my knees enough to take care of my feet anymore , I got this product to make it easier for my husband to remove my callus's  He was terrible with the hand held sander and hated doing it because he was constantly jabbing me.  He loves this callus remover my feet were in really bad shape, It was quick (huge plus), it was easy (for him) and not painful for me  We like it so well I ordered one for my Sister. Thank you from both of us for a great product..
B00YQKKKRS|5|Works Fabulous
B0037HP9OA|2|It doesn't seem to hold a charge and it won't even turn on anymore.  Seemed to worked pretty well when it actually worked, but don't know what to do now.
B000JLFFGE|4|Good solid product. Not sure how long it'll last but worth the bucks.
B003FBI9LS|5|I had never heard of a deep waver before, this thing ROCKS. I have long hair, about 4&#34; past my shoulders and lots of layers, this thing takes less then 10min to do perfectly and like 5 min with no time and still my hair looks great! It covers a lot of hair at once and you only need to hold it on for 4+ seconds. I don't know how I did without this thing. I did buy the &#34;matching&#34; hairspray and love that, but at $11 a bottle I will stick with a 3$ tresseme bottle from Target.
B0013TVEYS|5|Perfect!
B00375Z9IS|2|I returned it, as after a few weeks, I started to develop red patches under my eyes. I have fair, sensitive skin, so maybe this cream is too strong. It went away after I stopped using the cream, so that was the cause.
B003E09CPM|4|We've got this on Subscribe & Save and over all like them very much. I'm taking one star away because one time one of them came broken. The rest have all been fine, though.
B008PEMOV6|5|You're not going to find an electric toothbrush better than Oral-B. The 5000 and 4000 (I have both) are the same for cleaning action. Both are great. The 5000 has a separate monitoring device that encourages you to do a thorough job. Use these brushes and rinse with Listerine and you shouldn't have any gum or cavity problems.
B00DQ2I0G0|5|The product arrived before I expected it.Dr song sent a discount cart. I lost :( .
B001KSCL3K|5|This lotion smells devine and feels so good on your hands. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin.
B008XLEXRO|5|Love it!  I enjoy waxing  in the privacy  of my home.  Best of all I get to save more money!
B0041R7C4A|5|I love this product.  Better than the salon price, too.  It came promptly through the mail as well.<br />I am happy!
B004MBS5UU|5|Recommended by my Dermatologist.  Great product.  Reasonably priced.
B004CZZ6NU|5|Another Great Neutrogena product - This color is really nice, just a nice subtle shade of caramel w/out looking waxy, glittery, or glossy.
B001T0HHD8|5|this makes really nice curls that last all day/night. i like it a lot.
B009PIR57O|4|Really does keep my color fresh between colorings. Smells good at a great price too!
B00CA5NH4E|4|The mitt is similar to those used at Jeju, the Korean Bath House.  It is very effective<br /> and leaves the skin soft by removing dead cells and lotion/oil buildup from the body.  Must soak first to be effective.  Recommend!
B004VJ6EOC|3|I thought it was going to be differemt
B000C1UEG2|5|My wife loves this perfume. We have been looking for it everywhere. She wore it all the time when we first met almost 15 years ago, and could only find it every so often. She was excited when she found it on Amazon.
B000HM4ZXO|5|I choose this because it works good and I tried other products and they did not even compare with this. I would reccomend it to anyone.
B001TOCLKI|2|The color and texture is beautiful, but one out of two I ordered is a demonstration product. Both tubes are not sealed, so I never used them. Disappointed + will not buy from this seller again!
B0084FGB9W|5|I swear by this stuff. Great quality.
B00JB2NKT6|1|This is a one time only use tube. Once you break the tip in order to use you can't save the rest.
B00GCS9KJQ|5|wow this stuff really conceals well! Too bad the color I bought is a little too fair for me (I'm a medium in tarte concealers for reference), but it works great as an under eye concealer. I set it with powder to diminish some of the shine that concealers naturally give. Great stuff!
B0093BCSU2|5|Color is very true!
B000OA9Z4S|5|Great product
B001T8MBPE|4|This is one of the best headbands I ever bought. I have fine, straight hair that almost everything slides out of. This not only stays in place, but it is the only headband I've found that doesn't pinch or scratch behind your ears at the tips (there's rubbery stuff on the ends that has stayed there for years- doesn't fall or peel off). The size is just right for my medium adult head.<br /><br />It is shiny plastic that is pretty stiff so it may eventually snap in haIf. I purchased one of these 3 years ago and am still using it. I have only found more on Amazon.
B0088KU5RM|4|this has a nice aroma... it is on the feminine side of things...i purchased this for my mother and she loves it a lot
B00513IDCS|5|Apparently this scent has been discontinued, so we were very happy to be able to buy it online. Great value and price.
B003X3YY6C|5|Trough years I saw how my hair started going from thick and full of body, to thinner and eventually falling from certain spots of my scalp. I didn't really do anything to fix the problem since I always thought there was no solution. About 2 months ago, I found out about this great product when I was talking with my hair stylist and she highly recommended the whole line when I mentioned my concerns.  I bought the regular shampoo and dandruff shampoo (sometimes my scalp gets too dry from regular shampoos) I also bought  the conditioner (which surprisingly was very liquid, almost like clear water and does not require rinse.....) and just in case I even bought the ampules.<br />Within a couple of days I started seen amazing results, and every day it keeps getting better and better. I couldn't be happier.
B004WRFIG8|1|I did not recieve my product so obviously I cant rate it.
B00251HDAC|5|I love this nail polish, especially for stamping!  It really pops and is a really pretty pink.  It's not too goopy or hard to work with.
B0069SQEK2|5|I am on my third bottle of this.  It lasts a long time because its' so concentrated. It is the best.  Keep up the great work.
B00GYB107Q|3|This lotion is a bit greasy when first applied, but it fades after a while. I didn't feel particularly moisturized about 15 minutes after I applied it, so I'm going to stick with other brands.  It does have a nice, underwhelming scent that isn't annoying.
B003KZC4GA|5|I have been using the firming pads for about two months that I got from QVC. I am 53 and my skin looks really good for my age(good genes,I guess) but my face was starting to sag.I paid such a high price on QVC and I wanted to get more when I found the great prices here.This really tightens up my face.I let my sister (55 yrs. old) try it and she said she could see and feel the difference in only 2 days.I have tried so many products that promises to help firm up your face,nothing worked.I was sick of reading about products and throwing away so much money for products that did not deliver. I use this on my neck and hands also.My hands look younger.I was really surprised.Thanks again for the great prices! I feel so much better when I look in the mirror.My neck is firm!!
B009YKK78C|4|i love this lotion a lot i just  feel since I've used it to much i want something new now. but great smell, doesn't tingle or hurt. also it'll get you tan
B003JUY38I|1|I'm not convinced this product was even legit.  I used it and sores broke out all over my head.  I wonder what was truly in this bottle.
B004UGJWRC|5|I love this item!  I wanted to be able to &#34;spritz&#34; one of my favorite perfumes which came in a traditional bottle.  I was able to fill this atomizer (with the plastic funnel provide) and reassemble with ease.  I use it every day.
B007K6K0IY|5|I received a free trial of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women's Clear Gel Antiperspirant from BuzzAgent and i'm shocked at how well this stuff is working so far.. it smells great, dried almost instantly, and no white chunks and marks!!! Also i noticed my shirt doesn't have wet sweat marks like it did just the other day with my old solid deodorant ! It was easy to get the gel out at the top, with a quick click. Several hours later on a 80 degree day i still feel good about it!.
B000WNLFBI|5|Gives a beautiful boost to my skin. It can appear and feel very oily so I apply to my skin at night so that it has a long duration of time to sink it. Then by morning my skin feels and looks rejuvenated and healthy.
B007ABOBQ6|5|I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be very careful regarding the products I use.  I love that this toner doesn't contain alcohol or other harsh chemicals.  I haven't had an adverse reaction to this particular toner, but it's still doing it's job.  It leaves my face feeling clean, and soft.
B00HIDT94U|1|I followed all directions and extremely disappointed.  The hair came out a lot my first couple times using them.  The brushes were kind of rough and irritating to the skin.I ended up giving the set to my 7 year old daughter to play with.
B000J3WFTW|5|This company has the fast shipping service I have ever used. Will be back for more
B0034KSQ1I|5|I have been very pleased with this lovely make-up bag! It is well-made, chemical free and very cute. The zipper works well with no catches, and I can stuff quite a bit of make-up into this bag. For example, I have 2 face powders, some mineral makeup foundation, a mascara, 3 four-color eyeshadows, 4 eyeliner/brow pencils, tweezers and 4 lipsticks in my bag right now. I am quite happy with this purchase :)
B00QRCH6TS|4|I am going to address why I rate these only 4 star first. The jaw needs to open a bit more as I have a few nails that are actually too thick to use these and I I have a severe arthritic condition that has curled my pinky finger of my left hand in towards my palm. The ability to swivel the head on these is perfect to get in the right position but since the jaw does not open as wide as my regular clippers I can not get the nail in the jaws therefore they are useless for one of the main reasons I bought them.<br /><br />That being said. the swivel head is awesome for my ability to only use them in one hand effectively. By turning the jaw to an angle I need I am able to clip my nails much easier and the handle is slightly longer allowing a better amount of leverage thus less effort.<br /><br />The smaller jaw opening I truly find a problem as most of my nails just barely fit where even a centimeter more gap would make a world of difference. Perhaps they will consider that in the future. If you have thicker nails these might not work well for you but if your nails are fairly thin they should work very well.<br /><br />(Please excuse the poor photo quality. Moto E has no focus of ANY kind so way to get cleaner pictures but is good enough to show the differences.)
B004DBUAGG|5|For starters, I live on a beach and it doesn't get that cold here. Snows every other year or so in April (thanks to global warming) and school closes automatically if it gets colder than 40 or so degrees, snow or not (just to shows how ridiculously they treat cold weather here). I ventured out for a winter lotion for this harsh cold weather, or &#34;arctic blast&#34; as they're calling it.<br /><br />This is my first Vaseline lotion. I really like the scent of Cocoa Butter Vaseline, so imagine my surprise when I discover Vaseline has a whole line of lotions, including their cocoa butter scent. It is a light scent that isn't harsh, artificial, or overwhelming at all. The scent alone is what prompted me to try this lotion first, and I'm glad I did. The lotion itself is creamy but not thick, and spreads very easily. I use it immediately after the shower and to touch up my hands after being in the cold. It goes on smoothly, sinks in quickly, and doesn't grease up at all if you use one pump per each arm, each leg, torso, back, feet. It greases up on my hands if I use too much, and have to wait a few minutes for it to soak in completely if using too much on hands. Half a pump is enough for my hands.<br /><br />Hours later after going outside briefly and my whole body is soft and velvety and smooth! I'm very surprised to find my torso soft and my feet still moisturized well. I like the lotion more than the petroleum because it soaks in better and isn't in a jar which easily contaminates from fingers. I am now a believer of Vaseline CocoaRadiant Lotion and will continue to buy this item for as long as I can. I love that they give you various sizing options of the lotion, from 3 to 32 ounces. I purchased a large pump of 32 ounces from Target at 6.69
B002PMLEK6|5|This is definitely the best product ever. It immediately leaves your hair manageable and it will hold the style.  it is great especially if you want to preserve curls. Amazing you will not regret buying this product, it is worth it.
B004F4EYT0|5|Everything you need and more to start tattooing :)
B00I073WLE|5|I felt wonderful applying, my skin feels soft, it does not have that greasy pasty sensation or that super icky shine that I can sometimes develope midday with some of my other moisturizing products.
B004FQGLQC|1|I've used a few dry shampoos before: this, TRESemme, Oscar Blandi, and Psssst!. This has GOT TO BE by far the WORST I've ever used. As a few reviewers have already mentioned, it does leave a film of powder.  I wear glasses and use it in the morning; when I'm done, I'm always left with a layer of white powder on my lenses. And the thing is, the powder is thick and grainy, so I absolutely HAVE to clean it off or else I can't see properly.  Another thing: the scent. I don't think that it's all that bad, but let me tell you this--when I spray it, both my sister and my mother immediately leave the bathroom. Take what you want from that comment, but it's true.  I will most definitely stay away from this.
B00N9DL9SW|4|Works well
B00QXYARPA|5|Works really well.  Definitely helping with the calluses.  Thanks!
B001FWXKMW|4|Worked well with our 3 month old that was getting a stuffy nose this passed winter. We used it with our Vicks Humidifier ..
B004I8NO8A|4|I see a lot of people saying lots of things and apparently folks who buy lots of different clippers.  But since I am guessing most are like me, you don't buy every brand of clipper on the market.  This Remington HC5550 has worked well for me.  I make a relatively short cut and do it myself.  It is easy to handle.  The charge lasted plenty long to complete my cut.  I'm not a styling freak, just like my hair to maintain a nice even cut.<br /><br />How will it work for longer cuts?  No idea.  I don't do longer cuts.  But if you do relative short cuts, and/or tapered cuts, or even love those high and tights, this Trimmer will do the job quite well.<br /><br />I have used it now for doing follow up, light trimming, and it once again is easy for me to handle and gave me no problems.  I am guessing, a pro-barber may not choose this, but I am not running a barber shop.  I am cutting my own hair, and it does the job quite well.<br /><br />How durable is it?  Good question.  If you don't toss it around, and continuously drop it, it seems plenty durable for normal home use.  Dropping it now an again from sink top level or even average shoulder level shouldn't harm it.  Though like anything, if you do that repeatedly, you likely will break it.
B001T7JYBO|5|I used with a primer, it has a great color and applies nicely.
B00BT8XWAW|5|they  are  the  best  thing  ever
B001AMRQ2W|4|It was a good price for the quality. Close shave for an electric razor.The charge lasts for many days of shaving.
B001A42R1A|4|Xylimelts have proved very helpful for my dry mouth problems.  Used at bedtime, they prevent me from being awakened and having to have a drink of water during the night.  I have tried several other products and the Xylimelts have proved to work best.
B000GUN9OS|5|I love these little things!. I had ordered another brand's similar item; however, that brand used small wax dots that melted to indicate a given temperature. The problem, they could not withstand storage in my first aid kit or my car. Thankfully, these are very different. I have played around with a couple of them and discovered that they &#34;reset&#34; after each use. That is to say that if exposed to a high temperature, like in a car, they retain their usability after they have cooled back down. Technically, they are reusable.
B001452D0U|4|it is good so far but i only used it once so i need to use it more to say more!
B0085UPTBC|5|even though i cant smell anything i still love vanilla toasted ginger sugar perfume.
B00I3VHKVK|5|Bought these for my teenage daughter.  She loves them!
B000BFTAZ0|5|Love the color and consistency of this powder blush.  It has a look as if it may be sparkly but it goes on matte.  It is buildable for more intense color, if needed.
B0006NXS28|5|This is my favorite. I've been using it for over 15 years and won't be without it. It is expensive though.
B0086I7AIS|5|Wonderful gift for my daughter!
B008AI1TLI|5|It give an extra pizaaz to my hairdos
B00H8APE4W|2|It is not work well. Still has a sweat hand and feet.
B00F4YBNUS|5|Great brush for makeup.
B003COAFPQ|5|I researched and product before buying it. I read about it and watched youtube reviews everyone raves about this oil. I needed something to grow my thin fading edges. I wear a long weave and thought it looked silly with a long thick weave and thin edges. I can say I really love this product. The smell is not noticeable like people exaggerate about. This is the only thing that keeps my dry hair smooth and shining. It lays my hair down after I apply it I wear my silk scarf. It keeps my hair soft and edges looking natural. I don't like the slick edge look. I can see a difference after a month. Slow progress is better than none. I will continue to use this product a little goes a long way.
B007ROCZVY|5|This worked great for my husband and my three year old son, the neck snaps fit them both just fine, hair easily slipped off the fabric for easy clean up. I just wish it had a carrying case for storage or stayed folded up more easily. It does have a strap to hang it up but I am not a professional so don't use it very often.<br />Overall a great buy.
B000TTPZQ6|5|Just started using it a couple weeks ago, so can't say much except that it feels good and I know it's very healthy for your skin.  I would have to check back with a review as time goes by in order to give more information.
B001VH6F9G|4|good price
B00AU9P2AO|2|I have used the whole line of Peter Thomas Roth products including pads. I find it too caustic for fair skin.I cut the number of applications  to twice a week but then got no results. For very sensitive skin I would not recommend this line.
B00D0NL2JW|5|Really a pretty summer color. I've had many compliments on this nail color. Another Opi that is similar is &#34;go on green&#34; which looks to be turquoise but does go on a bit greener (as the title says). Dominant Jeans is a true blue turquoise.
B0077LAJT2|3|I mount these razors in an ordinary Merkur DE. I shave both my face and my head and have fair, soft beard and hair. I get 3-4 face shaves (two passes, with grain) and one head shave (one pass, with grain) before I have to throw the blade out. You may get more shaves out of the blades depending on how course/dense your beard/hair are.<br /><br />These are recommended razors on all the vintage shaving forums as good beginner blades because they aren't as unforgiving as some other blades. I would agree that this is a low-nick blade if you are new to wet-shaving of any kind, but the nick-nervous forum posters sensationalize the &#34;dangers&#34; of wet-shaving IMHO. These razors are definitely VALUE blades. They are a reasonable balance: they are cheap and sharp, but they don't last very long and when their edges go, they GO.
B004J51S80|5|I absolutely love this product and swear by it.  It works so well with my hair and is so cleansing that I refuse to use anything else but this product. It is absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />Not only is this product geared towards both genders but it can also be used daily on your hair if you have a color treatment or perm of any kind without ruining your treatment.<br /><br />Although, I do not have any chemical on my hair, as I do not need it, I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in proper haircare and nutrition.<br /><br />The one thing that I do not care for in general is that retailers including Amazon.com are still offering the older brand of this product, located in brown bottles, that is so totally different from the newer model and/or brand that it is beyond belief.<br /><br />It has also been very difficult for me to find this product online recently and would love any feedback from anyone regarding an online reliable retailer that offers this product in the event that I cannot find it again in the future.<br /><br />Nioxin, you have an everlasting customer in me!<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon.com!
B00FYYMK0A|5|This purse is awsome. Vibrant colors and well made. Much better than I expected. The wife said she received many compliments.
B00GP9ZE10|5|the best yet,,,, easy to use and clean....
B003E7UNE4|5|This is a miracle worker for wash and goes..... some say it leaves their hair feeling crunchy, not mine.  I applied a leave in conditioner prior to applying this product and it was great.  It did not weight my hair as much as I thought it would.....  Also..... on a second day twist out, I applied a little gel to each section as I re-twisted (a little okay) and it was perfect...no cruch, no frizz not dry, just nice soft bouncy twist that lasted two days!<br />This product arrive within days...again overseas!  I brought this from Amazon ...less that $4 for a very large size.
B003FBG7UI|4|Before this, my wife would have to fan dry her hair if she wanted it to dry it in any way faster than just \\"air\\".  Now with this, she can safely straighten and dry her hair right after towel drying her hair.  It saves her so much time.  She enjoys using it and thinks it's great.  Affordable and well designed.
B005SFLQ2I|4|i like this perfume, not loving it,
B000EN9NTW|5|The Bare Escentuals Get Started Kit allowed me to try this product that I have been hearing about for a few years.  I love the kit...I love the makeup.  It takes a few days for your skin to adjust, but the end result is amazing.  I have noticed my skin is smoother and brighter.  Others have commented on my lovely complexion.  I would recommend watching the DVD before using the product if one has not used it before.  There are some good techniques and information that will prevent possible disappointment with the makeup. I will definitely use any of the Bare Escentuals line.
B003AVNK0S|5|I've had skin cancer in the past, so protection is obviously crucial to me. I used this sunscreen on a recent trip to Italy and I loved it. It served me well and I plan to purchase again.
B0086VIAB6|5|Although I think you will only need one for a very long time, it is good to have some backups.  I am still using the first one after the first year, with an occasional cleaning.  Frustration free packaging is the way to go for the discount.
B000GC1TGG|5|Using these products has made my hair look more healthy.  I get compliments all the time.  I've noticed less frizz and more lushious curl! <br />Best of all the cream is not sticky so I can touch my hair or even run my hands through my hair once it's dry.  I am in love with bumble & bumble.  A customer for life!
B004CT3PFM|5|Love the way it makes my hair feel!  And I joke to my friends, it mellows me out but makes me hungry for cheeto's...LOL
B004QK7N46|5|For over a year I searched for a moisturizer that would work on my extra dry skin. I spent as much as $250 on one product and then I found Renew from SkinCeuticals a few months ago and it has solved my dry skin problems. My skin was literally flaking off in places and nothing I seemed to do helped. I use Renew day and night. It is exfoliating, which is probably why it's so effective, so just be aware that every day when you use it, you'll be rubbing off dead skin.
B003YLYT6I|5|This stuff and similar products really work.  I use it twice a day and now have real eyelashes for the first time in my life.  Gave some to my sister, who was similarly afflicted with short, stubby eyelashes and she now has respectable eyelashes.  Probably about 1.5 times previous eyelash length.
B00MPDXHDW|5|Bought for my dad as a gift. He loved it and using it with his normal shave gel was an even better shave than an expensive hand razor. Charges great and lasts more than enough time to shave. AND IT CAME WITH AN EXTRA HEAD FOR FREE!!! what a bargain. I am going to get one for myself now. I hate shaving but this thing works so well and is so easy that it might be less of a chore.<br />Can't speak to longevity since he has only been using it for a month now but so far is great for someone who shaves everyday.
B000NFB8S0|3|The soap is fine, but DOVE changed the design of the container from a flat top to the current one, which does not allow you to rest it on its head upside down to use the remainder of the contents. This amounts to throwing way about 10% of the contents = more waste, as well as the equivalent of a 10% price increase. I will not buy this soap again unless they go back to a flat top.
B00AQ9QMQG|5|excellent phone I love everything
B00581N2Z6|5|works quite well , i will order again
B002USK15E|5|This is the real deal and Amazon had best price - very soft and feminine perfume with just a touch of roses - a great choice for a romantic's perfume!
B00AU82TP6|5|This stuff is amazing. My stylist used it on my hair after I got it colored. My hair was super soft so I had to buy some for at home. I use this plus the thermal straightening balm, dry and the style my hair with either a flat iron or curling iron. No frizz or fly aways. This is A++++.
B000GHK6OW|4|I thought this was more moisturizer than sun screen, my mistake but its very nice and smooth on the face and I use it daily.
B009EFG358|5|This really helps with those pesky bumps you get under your neck from shaving. I use this with warm water and a new blade and have virtually eliminated all neck bumps.
B001EYCTAK|4|Apogee has a very good hair strengthen line. I like the vitamins
B000V1QTBM|4|I love how my hair feels after using this! Not quite as curly as I had been hoping for but maybe I am not using enough or my hair is too long or something. But my hair is soft and smooth and just so touchable! It's a good product even though it is a little pricey.
B00ISP4WJ4|5|Have been using for a few years, love this stuff! Tried wen, but couldn't justify the extra money since this seems to work just as well. Keeps my hair super soft.
B000MVYJ0O|5|Very good soap. Doesnt last as long as I would have hoped. I think maybe two/three weeks with two people using every day. Smells good, makes me feel clean afterward. My husband seems to like it.
B0050QJHTO|4|after doing so many research on curling wand, i decided to get this one. I have never used a iron wand before so I figure I will buy something not too expensive. Overall the wand works great. It's very hot and curls my hair fast. The only down side of this wand is that my hair tends to slide down to the small end of the wand and the curls are too tight.
B00461F4PA|1|I followed the weirdly written directions exactly (poor Japanese translation maybe). This product did nothing for my feet!  In fact I think they look drier.
B00J8UJNU6|5|It's very moisturizing and it doesn't irritate my eyes, and that's very important to me.<br />I think It still needs more time to start working though.
B000R8WOT0|5|This product works best for my color-treated hair. It is not as harsh as others and doesn't leave a orange tinge to the color treatment...
B001KYOCTK|2|I'm very confused by what these posts are saying about the fragrance! I bought this lotion based on the great review on the smell...but it smells like sunscreen!!
B000JGP1HC|5|I always like this over the latest versions.
B004LSJSBY|1|dries my 4c hair out
B001VMQLIQ|5|Love the spring hinge. Glasses work great.
B00GO4KSRG|5|I've used Argan oil before but the product only had a little oil in it so it didn't do the job. A friend of mine who owns a salon told me to only use an organic, pure argan oil and about Ammara so I tried a bottle, let me tell you I'm sold. I noticed a difference right away!
B004DGF2BE|5|GREAT STUFF, NOTICABLE CHANGES BUT, DO PREFER THE GOOD TASTING LIQUID FORM LESS HASSLE CONSUMING BUT, MORE PRICY.
B00IIB82FS|5|This was for my mom.  She loves this product as it has reduced the puffy under eye look.  Product is applied morning and night.  No burning or irritation. Skin around the eye is soft and smooth.  Surely a WINNER!!!
B000YLC80U|5|These are quite handy. The only drawback is the connection to snap it back together wears out and doesn't hold as well as when it was new.
B00JG30YGM|5|Please keep This product I love this color!
B000BKIJXE|5|A doctor first recommended this to me. I have Fibromyalgia and used to get sick all the time. Then I started high doses of Vit C and I rarely got sick. With FLU-BAN, if I start to get the flu or colds, it knocks it right out.  I don't know science other than the olive leaf has curative powers and this is a blast of it. Just keep in business East Park and I will buy this product forever.
B002AMUF2Y|5|I switched to the Clarins formula for dryer skin and it really makes a difference.  My skin doesn't feel as dried out by the end of the day.  It really does make a difference.
B0041HTTA0|5|Thank you
B007Y6O2FM|5|Must you RAPE people when pricing this powder?  I know it's no longer available, but REALLY?  Typical human behavior feeding off of others misfortune of not being able to get this product anywhere else.  Shame on you for letting this happen.
B00B2PXYKK|4|Good
B00014FTTM|1|I used this with Reviva Labs TGF Beta-1 Cream, used them twice daily. They made my skin very itchy so I needed to stop using them both. I thought overall it was a huge waste of money. I do not recommend Reviva Labs to anyone.
B001BTMU8Y|5|I've tried many dandruff control shampoos but none have worked as great and as quickly as this.  After 1 washing the dandruff is gone!  I originally purchased this in trial size because I was skeptical.  I was so satisfied with the results I purchased the largest size I could find in 12/08 and have enough to last well into 2010.  It's quite costly but well worth the price.  The smell is great and your hair is noticeably smoother and less split ends.  You'd probably spend as much in cheap shampoos over the next year and not get the results this offers.  A little goes a long way.
B000FGC99Y|4|I like that there are no phosphate in this and that it is affordable. It is not my favorite but I like it.
B007W5LRN0|3|I received within 2 weeks and it very we'll made. But I feel it's way to thick. It picks up too much acetone for clean up and I can't control it. It's not for me.
B00JF82JDO|5|This combination of oils and cocoa butter is very gentle and leaves my skin smooth and soft.
B0057TPUPY|5|It is moisturizing, has good coverage (to take the place of foundation), and is a very effective sunscreen.  I use this for regular daytime wear, even if out for a run before meetings, etc.  I have been using this product for some time, and think it's the best.
B001GGWE8S|3|As stated in the title the phone works well but the clear plastic cover for the picture button was lost when mother in law dusted.  It didn't seem to connect well when the pictures were added, seemed loose.  I should have sent it back when I put it together and realized the possibility of it falling off.  Live and learn.
B0019IZ6B0|5|Excellent product!  Holds spiked hair but water soluble so washes out easily. Use to finish styling.  Separates and adds definition.
B00QVCXSVO|5|Good product
B00IS6XPQY|5|I just started using this product but Im already seeing a difference in my lash growth and thickness, I lost a lot of my lashes due to an eye disorder so I'm excited to see some regrowth ...
B0083HT8YQ|5|I was very pleased with this oil.  The smell is heavenly.  A sort of almond scent.  And the oil absorbs very well and doesn't leave you feeling greasy.
B000ME2YWG|5|I am the laziest person in the world when it comes to styling my hair.  I also am completely uncoordinated with a brush and blowdryer.  I have extremely thick hair (before my hair went curly - it used to take 3 perm solutions to have enough to do my hair).  My hair turned curly after I had my son.  I decided to try this product and it is amazing.  I can fully dry my hair in about 1/2 hour.  I did find that it was hard to get it to grip my hair if I just used it like a comb, but if I put it under my hair and used my other hard to press my hair into it - it worked great!  Completely straightens my hair and I can even make it curl under on the ends.  After your hair is dry and straight you can change the setting to cool and it even removes all of the annoying frizzies.  I find that I don't even need to use a ton of product like I used to use with a flat iron.  I recommend this to everyone!
B000NLFX7Q|4|This is wonderful for removing makeup, even waterproof mascara.  It is very moisturizing if you use according to package instructions, which you apply and then tissue off without rinsing.  I'm not a fan of the protective film it leaves behind, so I usually follow with a warm washcloth to remove additional residue.  Great for cleansing your face in the winter months.
B0000Y8H3S|5|It works very well if your hair loss is due to lack of blood flow in the follicles. A lot of people say it doesn't work but it's probably because they didn't consult a dermatologist before buying this product.<br />I've seen a re-growth of about half an inch in the upper part of the forehead (it's where I had the hair loss problem) and with zero side effects after using it for 6 months twice a day, every day.
B00LE6MYOE|3|I gave it 3 stars only because I don't know yet. I saw some great reviews and was anxious to try this, specially concerning the disppearance of dark circles under my eyes. BUT, the research says it takes 4-8 weeks before you see a difference and it hasn't been long enough to tell yet.
B0036R6SL4|5|I received this eye cream as a sample when I purchased the Anti Cellulite Body Blaster Scrub!  This is the best eye cream that I've ever used! My eyes have never looked so moisturized & refreshed! And the smell is so yummy that I'm tempted to taste the cream every time I use it! LOL!  I'm sold on Skin QR Organics!
B009XPRZJW|3|Very good for the price
B000TK99NU|5|This is the best conditioner I've ever used on my frizzy, dry, curly, color-treated hair. I sometimes use it instead of shampoo (I also use Deva Curl's No Poo) to clean the sweat out of my hair after a hard workout on the days when I don't want to use both the No Poo and the conditioner. You can rinse it all out or leave some in for extra moisture. My hair is never greasy. My only complaint is that the scent of this one (sort of a light Skittles scent) doesn't really go with the light rose scent of the No Poo. However, even when I use both of them, the scents don't linger in my hair, so there's no obvious clash.
B00M9IG744|5|Great product!!!
B0010EIDWC|5|Loved this bracelet!
B007JJ2DO6|5|This stuff is GREAT. I am obsessed with chap stick/ lip balms and this one delivers. The smell is exact to cream de coco (I'm a big pina colada drinkers... the smell is EXACT).
B000AN8SLK|3|I like the color and the size of the barrette, but the clasp is small and inadequate for thick hair. I have two other France Luxe Barrettes I purchased elsewhere and they are much more usable for thick hair. I will keep the barrette, but will have to use an elastic ban to contain my ponytail and use this barrette to cover the elastic.
B00AC2KDXK|5|It has become one of my wife's favorites.
B00N4UXI6G|5|I have ordered from Amazon for over a year now and this is my very first review I've ever written on here. I just wanted to say that I absolutely love this product. I'm a 22 year old mom of 2. I am 5' 9&#34; and 125lbs. After my second child I started getting mild cellulite on my thighs and this product has helped so much! I've been using it for about a month and a half, once daily, with the finulite massager mitt. I love the cool tingle it leaves after applying. I will definitely be purchasing again!
B00GNXOYRS|1|***updated! I had this hair in for 4 weeks. It was horribly matted and unbelievably tangled. THIS IS NOT EAYON HAIR!!...... It's PLASTIC! When I comb it, you can hear the strands breaking. This hair is worst than Bobbi Boss Hair. Let me be clear.....MEIZ HAIR  is NOT Eayon Hair. I just took this crap our of my head and I wish I could get my money back. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!     THE HAIR IS FAKE!!!! The vendor wasn't Eayon. It was Meiz Hair. I've received hair from Eayon and it disappointed me at the end. But this hair.....FAKE. As soon as I co washed it, the curl pattern disappeared. There were plastic things in the wefts and red thread. After the co wash the shedding became noticeably worse. I'm upset I can't return the hair since I washed it. So I'm stuck with these synthetic tracks.
B00ED5HD08|5|I used these to downsize my face care system for travel, and they are perfect. Size is great and really organized my carry on.
B003BQOZAQ|5|I like it
B0087IVSV2|2|this product is a good idea however there's no real grip on the handle and the brush constantly falls out of your hand as I stated it's a good idea very poorly constructed very hollow plastic very weak bristles but the idea make sense
B00791FEHC|5|Liked it!  Since past 5 years, I have been using Lotus Lip Therapy Cherry and having tried a lot of other brands, I somehow end up on this very product. It keeps lips not only away from chaps, but also adds shine like you applied a lipstick or gloss. Back in India, it was easily available in stores, but now moving to US, have to order through Amazon. As it has become a daily need, hope to have this product in easy prices :)
B00EE5V3IK|3|Eye brush is small, but okay for eye-shadow.
B00E3EOA0A|4|I have used it for a while, it does smooth the skin and make it soft temporary, however for a long time solution you still have to use creams, lotions, oils.
B001RVRWD4|5|My wife has purchased this perfume four times and loves it still.  She use to use Halston, but switched to this three years ago. The amazon price is also a lot less than the department store price.  Of course the colonge is cheaper but the perfume is nicer.
B000V5F2NO|5|I first used this tape awhile back and I liked it so much that I wanted to keep purchasing it.
B00CJ01QT8|4|I have been using this product for a few weeks now, not a lot needed, so, goes a long way on usage, but, haven't noticed any significant changes yet
B00LZLUA9E|5|very satisfied...fast service...already up and half filled with essential oils!!!!  LOOKS GREAT!!!
B000EMDKG0|5|Loved it!
B002B5ECBU|5|Amazing night cream.  I have wanted to use Shiseido for years and thought it was too expensive.  I was wrong and noticeable results.
B00L4HJX7O|2|this really broke out my skin and I am 60 yrs old and got pimples after using<br />It may have just agreed with my skin .
B010E67KAW|5|This eye mask is amazing. It smells wonderful and it fits nicely over your eyes. It's lightweight enough that it stays really comfortable. I love that you can heat it up a bit or freeze it for that extra calming sensation. I received this for free/discounted for my review.
B004NTM2IW|3|It okay. I did notice a significant difference but I think i expected a little more. My feet don't completely stay dry. Give it a shot though, many have found this great for them.
B00IKD3MX6|5|Great product. Makes my skin smooth.
B00C32Z3GO|5|it was good
B00DQ2ILQY|5|Great item
B0016G18L2|5|A quality product in my book!  What a relief for dry hands.....good moisture and the protection lasts!<br />I have bought many tubes of this product, its well worth the price!
B005NAD9HI|1|Perhaps I'm just sensitive, but when I put this stuff on my hair, I got a day-long headache. I figured that couldn't be right - the headache must have come from something else - only I never get headaches. I tried the gel one more time and the same thing happened, with the headache lingering even after I washed my hair to get rid of it. In addition, while the gel is indeed unscented, my batch has a very faint foul smell. Hard to describe - maybe like something dead. My bottles were a special edition, with a maple leaf design.
B00198BKHO|4|Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\"black\\" soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it's dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.
B000VUZVJ4|5|The socks are really good quality, perfectly dyed and comfortable to wear.  They didn't bleed off on our feet or shoes.
B0012XO2W6|5|This is my new favorite facial sunscreen. I had been using a different brand but they changed suppliers and the quality suffered. This product is slightly tinted, but as a nearly-porcelain-skinned person, it still shows up as slightly lighter than my skin tone. I'm ok with that, as it is completely non-irritating and goes on very smoothly. It's lovely on its own or under makeup. The price is very reasonable given the quality of the ingredients.<br /><br />Edit: after a year of using this product it's now darker than my skin tone (but still invisible once it's rubbed in.)  It's so pleasant to use that for the first time in my life I'm wearing sunscreen every day, and my skin has lightened. That wasn't what I was going for but it's not a bad thing, because I have a bit of the redhead/freckled coloring, and a history of various kinds of skin cancer in my family. I ordered this and another fairly expensive (for me) sunscreen after developing a few big brown blotches on my face. Sun damage in my 30s, even though I've never tanned and rarely (as an adult) burned. I still have the brown spots but I'm hoping I won't develop more now that I'm using daily protection.<br /><br />A nice added benefit is that the redness from past acne scars fades a lot faster when I'm not getting UV exposure on my face.  I'm enjoying my clearer skin. Oh yeah--I'm acne prone with sensitive skin and this doesn't cause any problems.
B00I1Z4660|5|Great product. Been using it for years
B00HO3C5PY|5|It was great!
B000NSS1AU|4|I've been using this product for years & I really like it, however, sometimes I wish they would increase the amount of product for more coverage. I'm also glad to learn that Sandy Blond will be make more available next year at more retailers.
B001FOFI0W|5|I rely on this product...you don't  have to use a lot and it really tames the fly aways and calms my &#34;Bad Hair Days&#34;<br />This is a brush in a bottle.
B00R1F2QZE|5|The product is fantastic. I got completely hooked on it. However it is cheaper on the actual website. Half off actually and still free shipping. Plus different ones to choose from. It works wonders on stretch marks and I make sure now that I don't run out. I use it about twice a week and it keeps my skin feeling amazing.
B00G5WO2VK|5|Great product, delivery fast and on time. My Girlfriend is very happy with her hair after using the product. Her Hair looks much smoother and shinny.  Will order again.
B003AGK628|1|I purchased this kit because of all of all of the 5 stars reviews; however, when this kit (Jheri Redding Satin Smooth Wax Warmer) arrived, the only items that were intact was the wax, strips, and the Satin Cool Soother Gel. It was one great mess. I wasted my money. Poor packaging. NOTE: Amazon did reply to my complaint but the seller, Nada!
B006JZ0L0E|5|I have been a big fan of the Too Faced brand for a while now, and this collection didn't let me down.  There isn't anything I can think of that would make it better!  Great product, gives a nice, natural look.
B008O4NEPC|5|This product is so cute! I suggest buying it!
B0084710GO|5|Great extensions, very easy to put in, feel great once in -- I was worried that they would 'pull' or slide around but they feel very comfortable and secure and blend well with my own hair. One note: I would say that the color is nowhere near the color in the pictures (and no, it is not just my monitor). I agree with the reviewer who said it is like a dark dirty blond shade. My natural hair is a very light brown with lots of blond highlights, so I was worried that the champagne blonde would be too light, but I emailed Tressmatch a few pics of my hair and they made this recommendation for the color. When the extensions arrived, they were actually DARKER than my own hair! So if you are considering ordering, go a shade or two lighter than you think you need. I do think they should take more accurate pictures. Overall, I am pleased and would recommend. They look great in and it's such a fun way to change up your look!
B0054PKUU6|5|I like the way this goes on and it doesn't irritate my pits. It does prevent stench and sweat for quite a long time.
B00756HQNQ|5|This really works my feet haven't looked this soft and delicate since I was in high school. I would recommend this to anyone instead of using creams to soften feet!
B0071HIDLS|3|I use it when I get out of the shower if my hair is really knotty from teasing and it works great! But I don't notice my hair any softer. It's also pretty watery. I may buy it again, because I LOVE all other Acure products, but I'm not too keen on this one.
B000YA9RGY|5|I first found this product when grocery shopping a long time ago and was very happy to see that Amazon has it in stock. Gives you great coverage but it not too sticky - wear it to bed every night.
B00IQMRHQY|5|Very good wig
B0044B4GJC|5|Infusium 23 is by far my favorite shampoo/conditioner! It smells great, and makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down. I have tried may other shampoo/conditioner combos (I'm looking at you Aussie, Herbal Essences, and Head & Shoulders), and many of them leave my hair stiff, greasy, and make me have to take another shower. I believe it is because most shampoo/conditioners contain sodium lauryl sulfate, while Infusium contains ammonium laureth sulfate. This difference in ingredients makes a big difference in how it makes my hair look and feel! I will never buy another shampoo/conditioner duo! Customer for life...
B003OXO61O|5|Use daily for my face and neck. As its a must for an older man who turned 48 and does great cleaning
B00MNK9R5Y|5|Very good, leave your hair looking and feeling wonderful.
B0071DEZVE|5|I love this makeup - it is light, but it covers well.  So sad that it is discontinued. I have not found another foundation that I like nearly as much as this product.  But eventually, I'll have to find an alternative.
B000AYGEIS|5|Great product and receivef quickly
B00193L3RQ|5|If I could give 5Plus stars this product would deserve it!
B00S81WTFW|5|No need to buy the more expensive products. This product has great reviews and they are correct.<br />My wife is very pleased with this.
B00DDZDC3G|5|great color true to chart
B0082QBMBA|2|I don't know if it's just me but this really doesn't seem to work.  Whenever I try to bond/glue it just falls off.  Did I get a bad batch?
B003XIXH38|5|MY DRY MOUTH & SOMEWHAT SORE GUMS HAVE FOUND A FRIEND IN THIS PRODUCT.<br />WHAT A RELIEF IT IS.. THANKS
B0032FSDOA|5|Have been using for almost 2 years.  Cleans my scalp and stops any itching without the medicinal smell.
B00ANQU5I8|5|Love this hair dryer, dries my hair in less that a third of the time my last dryer did. Very well made.
B001063NY8|5|Works for fungus
B002SKWJ7C|1|This product does nothing for my hair, except leaves it full of residue and feeling crunchy and sticky, and looking dull.  The smell is nice, but the product itself sucks.  BTW, I used the product sparingly.  I gave it one star because that's what was required in order to post this review.  I definitely would not recommend this product.
B004RQVCUK|3|I bought this for a friend to wear to a rave so we could get in for a lower price. If we had actually made it there it would have been completely worth it. It's what it looks like.
B0009953KY|5|I was amazed firstly to find this product for sale at all because it was the exact thing I was looking for and it was great to find it.  The product itself is perfect for my small space.  It is rather heavy so you will have to be sure to anchor it well to whatever wall space you use.  It has been fine in terms of not accordioning out when I wasn't telling it to so not sure what the other reviewer was experiencing.  Overall a well made lovely mirror!
B00014EG5A|5|came early w/ no problems -- good & no issues
B000C1ZCOG|3|this is my 2nd all time favorite perfume. anyone who likes a beautifully fresh scent this is the perfume for you. the only problem with my purchase was the company who collected payment and shipped it (not amazon) did not ship it till 4 days after the estimated arrival so i did not get it till a lil over a week after the longest est. arrival date.
B00C3WQ0HA|4|One of the best eye-shadows around, all the colours are fab! so easy to apply and very sparkly. The items were supposed to come with free earrings (which I didn't really want) but they were not sent and I ordered 6 eye-shadows (in case you did want them, it looks like a con). Happy with the items received.
B00O2X53NU|5|I like the smile
B005DKKBRY|5|I've never been much of an electric razor fan because I've always felt that they didn't provide the level of shave that I need/want.  However, I broke down and gave this one a try after reading some of the reviews and I couldn't be happier.  The shaving head has the option for you to lock it in place or let it follow the contours of your face and the ability to do both really provides a good, clean shave.  The battery life is excellent as electric razors go and I'm a huge fan of the wet/dry capabilities.<br /><br />One of the best pieces of advice I can offer is one that I read after digging through all of the reviews on this site and that is to give this 30 days.  I just passed my 30 days and I use this razor just about every day of the week.  If I have a few days growth then I will use a regular razor and switch to this for the rest of the week, but as long as you don't let your beard go for more than a few days (or even a day for some of you lumberjacks) you should be good.
B003VFYANY|4|It's really the good for my hair after coming from the salon the four stars it's because it came late was supposed to come a week before
B0036ZAAVU|4|I really wanted the Belly Rub by Lamaze (I had a sample and Loved it) but that was the only thing I could find (I also had sample but I liked Rub more than cream - the rub is like jelly and smells more intense!<br />Love the smell! I like it a lot, my pregnant belly is happy:) I do recommend it:)
B00A8LSFX0|2|This tanning lotion smells great, but did not redden me or cause any tingling effect on me. Will not purchase again.
B00CM89Y4G|5|I love these eye shadows because you can get both looks, the natural one with just a little touch of the brush because they are very pigmented and the &#34;night out&#34; kind with a little build up with out being to heavy
B004D2C57M|2|I didn't see any result from this product; it's basically just another moisturizer with the &#34;hype &#34; of erasing wrinkles.
B001C46GHO|2|Lids not interchangeable
B00JTY6WQ4|5|I have used the Derma Roller only once so far.  It was a bit daunting to begin after looking at all those needles.  Once I started the rolling, it wasn't painful, just a bit uncomfortable which you can easily control with the amount of pressure you apply.  Following the treatment, my skin was red in some areas which continued through the next day, much like a windburn, but that was my fault as I went over one area twice and should have stopped after one cycle around the face.  I moisturized immediately afterward expecting stinging, but had none.  Two days later, my skin feels better, softer and has more firmness.  I plan on using it once every third day to start, but am encouraged after only once use and plan to continue using it.
B00LCF8IEW|4|i love it ...
B002I9KPCY|1|Never, never, never purchase a Mason and Pearson product. I bought this brush for my toddler daughter and despite following the care instructions EXACTLY, the bristles began to fall out within months. I contacted Mason and Pearson directly and not only were they rude to me (telling me that Amazon.com is not an &#34;authorized e-tailer&#34;--though this is not disclosed on their Web site--and therefore they would not stand by their product), they also insinuated that I had somehow not followed the care instructions. I guarantee you will essentially flush $50 down the toilet if you purchase this brush.
B004WMFVU6|2|I don't believe this was an authentic product. It's smelled like apples. When I went to a local salon to pick this product up, the product was authentic.
B003EUR1D2|5|I have used this for about 3 weeks, my hair is not as dry and it actually has some shine. Understand I have hair that is thinning and has a tendency to be a little fuzzy. Not anymore, now if only you could get the conditioner, my hair would look like it did before kids.
B00L2SWF7K|4|This does moisturize and soften the skin, not sure yet if it eliminates the wrinkles, had only used it for over a month.
B001AYG2P2|5|This myrrh is really nice quality. I started making a tincture out of it the day after i received it. I did have a few sticks and small stones it the mix, but hey, it is a natural sap resin product. I would recommend this Myrrh highly!
B001DEYP8K|1|For a shaver with a high rating, who is doing the rating?  This shaver should be an insult to the Remington name.
B000053L6W|5|Exelent smell, my girlfiend got it for me for a christmas present and wow am i impressed. I use prada, porasso, taylor of old bond street, ect.... this is by far the best scent ive had so far. Highly recommended for both young and old.
B004M07UG6|5|Because of a health problem, I'm perpetually dehydrated--and my feet show it.  I have tried countless creams, oils, lotions, and balms in an attempt to keep my feet moisturized, and this is the only product that penetrates well and leaves my feet actually soft.  Simply put, it does a GREAT job.  Here's how I use it:  When I'm ready to relax in the evening, I slather this stuff on my feet, rub it in, and then put on a pair of socks.  By morning time, my feet are actually soft, and my socks have absorbed any excess product.  (I don't recommend putting this on your feet and then walking around w/o putting socks on first; you'll get it on your carpet, and you can easily slip on your tile/wood floors.)<br /><br />I admit that this product is pricey, but it's worth it.
B00CP7WIY2|5|excellent product and delivered timely  thank you
B00147FGJ8|3|I'm still doing my own investigation to see if the product is same lotion you would purchase from a tanning salon....just being a sceptic.
B00QPQNM76|5|Great razor.  Works as expected and comes with lots of blades.
B004AI7G4G|5|From spouse of account holder..<br />You want really pretty nails? Use this as recommended on the instructions and you WILL get and see results. Do NOT use more than twice a day. Take your vitamins in conjuction with this product too.<br />Adding this note.... what I like about this product is that you do not have to use color if you don't want to.  You can add over your nail color, however.
B00FGJEG4Q|5|This is my favorite (beauty) product of the year. I received this all natural lip balm as part of my Ipsy beauty subscription one month and didn't even think anything of it until I tried it recently. This is hands down one of the most moisturizing lip conditioners that I have ever tried. I goes on smoothly and has this amazing citrusy scent as it is made of mandarin green orange essence. I reminds me of citron peel--so refreshing. They have the .15 size for $5.50 on their own website or the .25 tube for $8.50. I don't ever want to run out of this and stocked up. If there's one item that you buy for yourself this winter, I'd highly recommend this.
B0037HP9OA|5|It is a great groomer that does all that it should.<br />Does it cut or nick? No, unless you are attacking your hair like its a hedge in the garden.<br />It takes time to trim down thicker and longer hair as the cutter can get clogged.<br />The shaver on top is great for removing hair completely - and it doesn't pinch, cut or leave ingrown hairs.<br />Put down the razor or scissors and buy this - your balls will thank you.
B004P2LL2K|5|This product did noticeably flatten my undereye bags and it helped with the appearance of my malar cheek bags. The trick was the application . I have had success using a rice grain size bead of the product squirted onto my hand and then very thinnly and carefully applied with a small makeup brush, stroking upward and outward. I have not yet gotten it to work when mixed with a dab of my usual Avon brightening concealer. I will keep trying i think it will eventually work. Right now i am just dusting mineral foundation over my dark circles to help cover them. Anything liquid messes up the effect. In short i will buy this product again. It is expensive but it works.
B000HIYE0M|4|Nice cleanser. I had to get pass the fact that there is no lather, but overall I will buy it again.
B001AWEARG|3|Although the consistency of the massage oil is nice and warm, the scent is a little too much like the \\"incense\\" type of scent for me...a bit strong.....I was originally trying to find juba oil, but the body shop doesn't do the unscented oil with the drops any more.
B000OLAMGC|5|Loved it.
B00065IBKK|5|All i need is buzz cuts, all the extras are fine.  It works, and it's cheap.
B002889468|5|FINALLY A AWESOME PRODUCT FOR HAIR REMOVAL. WAX IS A MESS AND CAUSES BLOOD VESSELS TO BREAK. OTHER HAIR REMOVERS SMELL REALLY FOUL AND CAUSE IRRITATION, NOT THIS ONE. EXCELLENT PRODUCT.
B00ARF42H0|4|works great, but can't use plugged in. Have to remember to charge it before use, annoying some days that it can't be plugged in to finish grooming. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
B004367X70|5|If you have extremely long hair or medium length hair. This is the item for you. I was tired of wearing the same old boring ponytails. With this you can create several different looks.
B00H1BPXUI|5|Definitely works!  I was skeptical as to whether it would work as well as LiLash, because that is the only lash lengthener I've ever had success with.  But this stuff really works. Love the mascara too, I will never use anything else again!  You need to give it like a month to see results as with all of them but my lashes look fake now, I love it.  It doesn't sting or anything weird like some other brands either.
B000C1VT3Y|5|I hate most colognes and perfumes... they're always too strong, or smell like something strange. I love this one, though! Ordered it for my boyfriend and it smells amazing. It's not too heavy. Manly but delicate. Love it!
B00JH0SA2Y|5|This is the best night serum I have ever used. I have mature (read, over 60) skin, and it hydrates without any oil residue or greasy feeling after it is applied.  Just takes a few tiny drops from the included dropper-top, and my skin absorbs it very quickly.  No oil in my hair or on my pillow, which is one of the best attributes of this serum. next to the really soft skin it gives you as soon as applied.  Nothing will take away the years, but this Kiehl's product makes my facial skin feel very soft and supple.  I have rosacea, too, and it does not redden, cause rash, or irritate my cheeks in the least.  Great for winter dry windburned face, especially; it's very soothing. And it smells great! I know it's expensive, but the little bottle does last a long time because it takes such a little bit.
B0041TF2ZY|4|I recently went all out and decided to go blonde for the first time ever. Coming out of the salon, my hair was a beautiful light blonde, getting darker as it came to my ends because of the leftover dye I had from previous dye jobs; it looked like a reverse ombre. But I noticed that a few days after getting it done, it started getting more of a dark blonde, turning into even a light orange and so I looked up some purple shampoos. I actually got my bottle at Sally's after researching some possible things. It's the second day using it and I've noticed my hair getting lighter. I'll update this review after using it for a week :) It is quite drying on the hair so make sure you use a really good conditioner, preferably one with moroccan argan oil like Tresemme. It'll keep your hair soft and smooth!
B007C8G4OY|5|I had purchased this item before from sephora but a different color which was the wrong color.  This color was a closer match to my skin color.  I wouldn't say that it lasts 24 hours but it lasts a long time.  I am always happy with lancome and would recommend this product to anyone.
B00BZXKCKY|5|Will make your hair grow. Buy it.
B00315EWC8|2|I have bought 2 of the Spiderman Spinbrushes and both times I was very dissapointed with their performance. While they do encourage children to brush their teeth, the brushes do not last very long. The first one lasted about a month and then it died. I thought that perhaps it was just a fluke, but then when the second one died in the first few weeks I decided that it must be something more than that. Dissapointed in product and will be looking for an alternative for the next replacement.
B006L677XU|4|I love this product! Granted, while it says to use it every time you wash your hair, I use it only when I remember to. I've been using it for just over a month and my hair has grown an inch (but I've also been taking Biotin daily). Nevertheless, I love this stuff. Would have given it 5 stars if it came in a larger container because it runs out really fast.
B0017PUPMK|5|Happy with the product
B00ESYFIVK|5|THANKS
B00H0NEPU6|5|I like this product and the fact that it is sulfate free.
B00B4TR3KG|4|Great smell!
B00C2BHZD0|5|Best brushes made
B007V6FPMO|4|I recently had the pleasure of sampling some hand and foot care products from Gold Elements. The kit consists of several products that will have your hands and feet looking their very best! The Golden Nail Kit Supreme consists of hand and nail cream, cuticle oil, a nail file, and a buffing block. I was very pleased at the results of this product. I take pride in the polished appearance of my hands and feet. As you can see from the picture I have provided, the Gold Elements does the job very well. The hand cream works equally well on both hands and feet for improving their appearance as well as providing a butter soft moisturizer. I do not think you will be disappointed with the results of Gold elements. Enjoy!<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.
B001DFS0MG|5|quited satisfied with the sellers remarks and they lived up to the<br />products performance and quality. no problem with performance.
B003JP4QMG|5|Perfect. I use to lock and store my makeup and hair products from my little ones. Very nice especially for price. very convienent.
B000K74XT2|5|I had never heard of Carol's Daughter until a co-worker of mine told me. My initial question to her was \\"Who's Carol and what about her daughter\\"? Then she let me smell and test her Almond Cookie lotion. Instantly, I knew I would purchase this product. I love the body butter! It makes my skin feel baby soft, especially on my dry feet and elbows. I use the product everyday.<br /><br />So, if you love the product as much as me, I would suggest you share it with your friends and family. Believe me, they will love it!
B001BR97A0|5|Thayer's products are great, and I especially love their Witch Hazel, which (no pun intended) I use daily to freshen and cleanse my skin before applying moisturizer. The cucumber is fine: I know many people consider it their favorite. My personal favorite is the lemon.
B00LUFVC9C|5|Absolutely love this. It goes on nicely. I have super sensitive skin and this has been the best thing so far for it. Essential Oils also blend well with it. (For the essential oils; Mixing in hand one application at a time not the entire jar)
B004UO38YM|5|I used this product the first day I received it and it works really well! The appearance of fine lines was gone! My skin was glowing for a week! I have recommended this to all my friends!
B0039OJLLI|5|great<br />I recommand
B002SQ4QOK|5|Wife loved it.
B00UKCR4RU|5|Nice.
B00CIH9JPA|5|These are absolutely beautiful!! Rose and rhinestone hair pins, perfect for any occasion or add one or two to jazz up a simple up do.<br /><br />The pins are sturdy, not flimsy so they can definitely hold a style. I love the design of these pins. They really are very pretty.<br /><br />I received this as a sample to try in exchange for a honest review.
B00OI4ANG0|5|This product is absolutely amazing. I highly doubt i would go anywhere else for results like this! I have always struggled with hair loss since high school, as well as my father and his father. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone seeking the absolute best results. Compared to name brands like Rogain, Infinite growth really raises the bar as far as quality and legitimacy. Very pleased with this product
B004QE83VE|4|I really do like the Gillette Venus Proskin Moisurerich razor. It shaves really smooth and I have yet to nick or cut myself with it. My only complaint is that the razor can be a little messy with the moisture bar as it has a tendency to get gooey and slimy while using it. I'm always sure to rinse it off good and give it a really good shake before I put it away to make sure it's mostly dried off. I don't store the razor in the shower where the water will hit it constantly or it would eat away the moisture bar in no time. I shave my legs every other day and this razor seems to do a really good job at shaving close and keeping my legs looking good for the time between shaving. Overall, I'm happy with this razor and might even buy some refills on my own when I'm done using up what came with the razor.
B00387F42Q|4|Haven't seen any results thus far but hopeful that it will diminish the look of wrinkles somewhat, eventually.  At my age I don't expect a miracle, just an improvement.
B00G4MWGDM|5|These glasses are great, they are durable and lightweight.  I would definitely order them again and would recommend them to all.
B004SUXOHO|5|I love this product. Sephora had discontinued for awhile and I was determined to find it again. It adds a nice shine/glow mixed in with foundation. So glad to find it on amazon and now back at Sephora.
B00604MSSC|5|Have used on and off for awhile. Have this on 'Safe and Sub'. The product is really good. Don't know if it 'Tones' but I like the foam, a little dab will do ya. Is not tacky after rinse and skin soft. I find the bottle a little hard to open, but do like the product.
B00GTUEA8S|5|Very difficult to find a foam pump in a travel size. This is great, although not quite as thick of plastic as I was expecting. It does not seem to leak.
B00KEGG6S0|5|After a few months of using their products, I'm absolutely committed to the Green Touch Beauty Cayenne brand.  Their products never fail to deliver on what they promise, and this hair growth shampoo is no exception.  My scalp is clearer than ever before, and I love the way it feels going on.  It's antiseptic properties can be felt from the moment you apply it, and the shine and health of my hair is better than ever before.  Cayenne makes great products with quality ingredients, don't pass this up if you're looking for a hair loss solution.
B002LFV8NK|5|Very nice color
B003JN7NW8|5|My favorite shampoo EVER...HAIR SMELLS CLEAN, SILKY,  SOFT,Pretty!!!!!
B0035QHMVQ|5|Awesome fragrance.  Wish they had not retired this one.
B0080CO2F4|5|Great! New and very cheap and beautiful to add to my collection. Recommend using this company for future use. Thanks!
B002N5MHL0|5|Great product and love that it is on subscription so I never have to worry about running out.
B0047PPCAW|4|This really makes your eyes soft and helps with your eye concealer to go on smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to say whether or not my dark circles have faded or if my wrinkles have gotten better ( I've only been using it for about 3 weeks) but I do love the hydration it gives the eyes!!!
B008DLT9H8|5|Love the bruch its soft and cheap compare to ulta brushes. 25 or 30 dollars for a brush um no love my new bruch
B00JBDEXO6|4|This is a great cream for my husbands hair. Easy to use...doesn't take much...and smells good.
B0088DL2GC|1|It wasn't as expected
B004A8Y63A|4|This shampoo is ok not as bad as other people rated it. It's natural and smells good. I do use this with my regular conditioners, I always use conditioner otherwise yes your hair will be dry and feeling stripped. I have tried many green conditioners and find them useless, using this shampoo puts less harmful things in the water and it leaves it clean almost so clean that it feels stripped as I said so I have no idea how some reviews say they feel oily after the shower....makes no sence unless you didn't shower for days!
B005MSEEQ6|5|I use this product to complete my wash-n-go hair style. I have kinky, tightly curled, coarse hair. I was so surprised by how nicely this product worked with my hair type. I love it! I usually use either Kinky Curly or Eco Styler Gel, but so far this product seems so much better. It is not as sticky or slimey as Kinky Curly and does not harden my hair like Eco Styler. I was able to achieve soft hair with curl definition. I do wonder why I have not heard more about this product throughout the natural hair community, but I love it so far and will continue to order it. Oh!!! Aveyou upgraded my order too! I recieved a complimentary upgrade from 8oz. to 16oz. It took a while to arrive but I was really appreciative of that. :D I should note that I used this product along with the Wonder Curl smoothie both on soaking wet hair. Hope that helps.
B002HK2GI0|5|I did a lot of research before I ended up purchasing this one. It is very well made and yes, as many reviewers have noted, it IS sharp, but that is the point! It needs to be. Also, just an added tip: I actually use the comb to apply the mascara. I rub the comb against the mascara wand first and then apply the mascara with the comb. Wow! Really makes a huge difference! And no clumps on the first application because you are using this amazing comb which keeps the lashes separate.
B0041U2U8U|4|Pretty much exactly what it says it is. I'm satisfied. Accidentally ordered 2 but no big deal. A little doesn't go as long of a way as I thought it would though.
B00JC0ZPK4|5|Love Wen.
B00O14F3WG|4|I've been using this in addition to better diet and exercise, so I have been seeing improvements and that can probably be attributed to both that and the cream.  I can definitely tell my skin is more moisturized and firmer, and as far as I can tell, this cream does help!
B00ARWNVG6|5|I received this beautiful hair clip and was very surprized how beautiful it was.  Considering what I paid for it I was pleasantly surprized how nice it was.  It took a lot longer for me to get it but I'm happy that I ordered it.
B0019ZEVZU|1|Move on to another product this is my 4 th one of this brand. Stops working after a few weeks or gets weaker.
B00IKTIGO0|5|Product was as described and came in great time! Thanks! This is my favorite product and I was happy to be able to share it with a friend!
B006VP8EBU|5|Gives great results.  Keeps your hair softer and more manageable.  I spray on after showering to keep my hair healthy.
B0049HYZHO|5|Everything worked well...
B005237PE4|5|This smells great and moisturizes my hair so much that I can run fingers thru it in the shower. I box bleached my hair so now I deal with very dried out hair.  I believe this helps.
B0002JHI1I|5|Works great!
B000P250TE|5|B. Regards
B001JQLNNW|4|Finally an anti-aging cream that does what it purports to do at a reasonable price.  No miracles but definetely a nice result.  It is nice to purchase a product that delivers! Try this stuff before you spend hundreds of dollars!
B000M5BWOQ|5|These Wilkinson double edged razor blades are just great. If you're new to using a safety razor, please forget other inferior blades. These give a good close and comfortable shave. Using these I've never had razor burn.
B009O5N6PI|5|Cuts real good I'm not a barber I just use it to shave my head. The liner cuts real low and the shaver finish the job
B003QBJ3AS|5|Very happy with results I see.  Have used other products in the past. This has worked best for me.  I think it's well worth it.
B0047PWKYS|3|After reading a limited number of reviews and visiting the Dermagenics web site, I bought in (literally) to the anti-aging experience I would receive if I spent $ 85 for the men's anti-aging cream.  Now I didn't expect a silver bullet, but was expecting results that could visibly confirmed by my reflection in the mirror or from a member of my family.  Well, after 8 weeks I can confirm that I spent too much.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good product, but for the price I expected something more than I received from other products that are about a third of the cost.
B00JLPM8AK|4|Good serum. No bad reactions. Completely odorless. Dries matte. Havent seen much results yet in weeks of use but skins seems to look a bit smoother.
B00ECAZFIG|5|Love the smell! Leaves your skin soft.
B00ETS7552|5|Love it
B003TBYW74|4|This product seems to be working well with smoothing out a 6&#34; scar that's a year old. The scar was raised and puffy depending on size of the scar you will need about 3 tubes and use as directed
B002T71IL2|3|I can speak from personal experience that your results are 100% user-facilitated, meaning that if you don't get good results, it's because you didn't do it right. How do I know? Because there are times I use this, and my lashes look amazing after; and then there are times I use it, and it's like I didn't even apply it.<br /><br />The reason I am giving this 3 stars (instead of 5), though, is because I haven't quite figured out from one experience to the next what the heck I am doing wrong/right/differently to result in such a wide spectrum of, er, results.<br /><br />But if you're someone who is really good at figuring these things out (or have a colorist's background and know your stuff), then this is worth trying.
B002N5MHLK|4|I have a heavy beard. I shave once a day. The closest shave I get is with a Mach 3, but sometimes I get cuts or irritation. I tried a different foil electric shaver in the past, but found that it took longer per shave than with a Mach 3, I still got the same amount of irritation, and the shave was no where near as close.    This shaver is much better than my last. It shaves closer, but still not baby smooth. My shaving time seems to be around 3 minutes and 30 seconds (it has a timer that tells you how long you shaved for). It irritates a lot less though, and can be used dry or wet (I seem to get better results dry).    Only problem is it often misses a lot of hairs around the lower neck area, which means going over and over that spot in different directions to try and get them all, and this leads to irritation. Sometimes no matter how many times I go over that area, there are some hairs it just can't get. I'm almost tempted to use a razor to finish the job, but I'm trying to just get used to it.    The cleaning base does a good job, although it takes about half an hour, and can be a little loud in a quiet house (goes on an off).    All in all it's a good shaver, and I'll stick with it, but it's not a revolutionary product. There's pros and cons compared to a Mach 3 shave, and cost adds up to more or less the same in the long run.    UPDATE: I gave up on the cleaning base. It's too loud, takes too much space, takes too much time, and starts to smell after a while. Just rinse the thing under a tap and rub some soap on it now and then. Easier, takes less time and doesn't clutter the bathroom. If you can, just buy the model without the base and save some cash.
B00K3Y3UV4|1|Bunch Arabians trying to make a name for this s***. No way I'll spend $10 on something like this. Probably cost $0.40 cents to make!  They are starting here in Chicago but I know they are promoting it like it's world wide. Better off with other products for the price!
B0009RF95K|5|Nothing but 5 star ratings, most convenient toothpaste ever, and I think it got discontinued :( I wish they'd bring it back! Why in the world would they do this to us :(
B004SPDEWE|2|Ok, so of course not everyone's skin is the same. I thought it would be fine since it said it was for 'all skin types'. I thought wrong. I have combination skin but more on the oily side. My makeup lasted not more than a couple hours. I won't be buying this again.
B001C4WL2I|1|Might be fake, after 2 weeks of use made my hair changed color and fall off. After I change shampoo my hair goes back to normal.
B008U5XS2O|5|Daughter says it does the job and is still working so what more can you expect. I guess it's a good one.
B0018ARXXI|5|I love this product. It was a surprise that I found it in amazon.
B0009JQFF6|5|I am a novice soaper.  I live in a very rural area and could not find shea butter around.  So I took a chance and ordered this.  So far the product feels great just being rubbed into my skin.  But I have to tell you the thing I was most impressed with was the price and the service.  Other places I found on line were charging 2x as much for 1/2 the amount.  And the s/h were outrageous on the others.  I was told it would be available to ship after 4/20, but thanks to  GREAT customer service, I received it on 4/18.  4 days after I placed the order.  I promptly re-ordered so I will have plenty on hand.    If you want good pricing and good service and good product, this is the place to go.
B00KD2AJ9M|3|The package came way before the estimated date. It is really really long. But they lie, it isn't hear resistant. Do not straighten! It will melt.
B00HJDIAGC|5|only needed to use it a few times.. It's strong and works great!
B00LXIQDPO|5|This thing is awesome! This is my first epilator so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it seems to work really well. To all the people giving 1 star reviews saying &#34;it hurts!&#34;: well of course it hurts! All epilators are going to hurt, you're ripping your hair out! BUT after a few uses you start to get used to it. I did my legs over the course of a few days and it works. I hate shaving, and waxing seems like a giant pain in the ass, so I like this because it's convenient and I can use it anywhere. No muss no fuss! I was surprised at how small it is, but now that I've used it I think it's the perfect size.<br />Also, this doesn't make your legs super smooth, since the hair needs to be a certain length before the tweezers can grab it, but it makes your legs look smooth, so it doesn't bother me.
B001KYQ4HS|1|Brassy! I read many reviews and you tube videos and decided to give it a go on my medium-dark brown hair. I put it on and waited... checked.. waited... checked. 70 minutes later my hair was still looking brassy, but it said to leave it no longer than 60 minutes so I finally washed it off. Tried a toner from Sally's and it did not help at all. Now I will be using a cooler brown dye to try to tone it down :( I would not recommend for virgin, medium-dark brown coarse hair like mine.
B000I1TNBS|5|the shipping was a little slow but as far as the product goes its a good buy. mind you i dont have to shave daily and i havent had it long enough to test the battery life but i am pleased with the shaver
B0080CO2F4|4|Very pretty. Not quite what I expected...thought it was a barrett. Corors of stones bright. Would consider buying here again.
B00DPE9EQO|1|Not sure why but everytime I used it it made me break out. I had small pimples the next morning. I tried it various times and it did the same think. I did not like it.
B0089N1CRA|5|These tweezers grip even the finest hair and the magnifying 10x tweezing mirror makes it a lot easier to see what I am doing. Great purchase!
B0087096Q4|5|Got here on time and I've had one of these before and it wasnt the best, but this one is really good quality and makes a really good bun on the first try. My last one took me a few tries and some frustration.
B0015QIYKQ|5|I haven't used Olay products for years because several years ago I had an allergic reaction to the foaming face wash.  The price for this product was right, though, so I figured it couldn't hurt to try again... on a weekend, when I could hide in my apartment in case it caused me to break out in a rash, of course.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I decided to take a chance on this product!  I've been using it every night for two weeks now, and I can see a huge difference.  My skin is so soft and line-free now... a few weeks ago I was starting to look tired and sallow from my long days in the office.  This product has totally rejuvenated my skin and made it look youthful, again.<br /><br />I will say, this product is slightly scented, which I don't love, but you can't smell it at all once you put it on.
B0092MCO88|2|I just received this and the plastic smell is so overpowering I actually cannot use it.  I am going to give it a little time to air out and try again but it's not looking good...
B009PFVUFA|5|The brushes works really good
B00G05JPIC|5|I hesitated buying the roller because the idea of poking myself with tiny needles did not appeal. But I decided to try after checking the reviews. I'm so glad I did. I knew it was a right thing for me from the first try. My skin became pinkish red after the first application. I cleaned the roller, and followed the instructions to the T. My skin is pretty rough with pigmentation and small pitted scars. They are not very visible but something that I wanted to get rid of for a long time. The skin tone is not very even and I'm usually pale. After the first application which hurt a little bit although I did not put any strong pressure on the roller, I felt my skin was vibrating and alive. It felt a bit like a sun burnt. I immediately followed with a serum (Vit C and other anti-aging vitamins in a serum), that helped to soothe the sensation of sun burnt. The skin was red for a couple of hours following the procedure, so I would not do it in the morning, only before bed time. Next morning it was visibly softer and plumper and had a light pinkish tone to it. I tried to use the roller the day after the first application but it hurt too much. My skin was still recovering and too sensitive. I have reread the instructions which said that you need to use it once or twice a week. That's my current schedule. I have had another application and my skin improved some more. Now it is more pinkish in tone and younger (i'm in my early 40s). I will update my review in a few months to report if any changes have been made to the scars and or wrinkles around my mouth (my main area of cosmetic concern). But i think it is working well already! Love my discovery!
B0002260NC|5|I am a college student, and this is finals time in my most stressful year of college yet. I stumbled across LUSH products a little while ago, but--like many others--was VERY skeptical about using a solid shampoo, especially one that seemed so expensive for such a small bar (see net weight of product).  So, in the craze surrounding final exams, I decided to go ahead and buy NEW!, just to see if it was worth the hype... <br />I received the package yesterday afternoon--and could smell it through the box. The smell is intense, but not overpowering: think--spicy candle from one of those expensive candle shops, except with more zest.  I took it out, and actually had it sitting on my desk for a while--it made the whole room smell good, before I even used it, too!  It has two cinnamon sticks embedded into its surfrace, which makes it even more appealing. By this point, I'm thinking: I don't care if it is a horrible shampoo, I just like the way it smells. <br /> <br />I get into the shower this morning--and with NEW! it was one of the best shower experiences ever! You know those commercials where women are lathering their hair and moaning? Well, I'm sure they're using LUSH's NEW! and not some other bottled stuff.  <br /> <br />The shampoo lathers very well, better than I ever expected, and better, even, than bottled shampoo.  It will probably last me longer than a bottled shampoo, too.  My hair is rather fine and short, but gets frizzy, so I use a conditioner, too.  With NEW! I didn't need to, it left my hair so soft and squeaky-clean, and smelling wonderful, but not too strongly.  <br /> <br />I actually can't wait to use it again--and because it has made me so happy, my stress levels have fallen considerably. It is great, and well-worth the money. (Trust me, I'm a college student, and often broke: yet I will repeat that the price of NEW!, AND the shipping costs were well-worth this little shampoo bar.) <br /> <br />Another plus is that it's so small and cute, and much easier to transport: so no packing of leaking shampoo bottles once the semester is over, or for any other trips!
B000VLXMC6|5|The product is excellent I love the product it really work, good job to does who make the excellen product.
B00CK0HQ1E|1|I am sorry to say, this is not at all what African Green Musk smells like. I have bought it for years from another vendor and decided to try it from this vendor. The scent is not similar at all. As a matter of fact, this smell is almost unpleasant. It also gave me a rash where I applied it to the skin. I pitched it.
B0013EKQ8S|5|I've used this product for a few years and really like it.  Buying it through Amazon was cheaper and the product was just the same as in a department store where it's more expensive.
B002SKIE62|5|These made great little gifts for the ladies in my office!  Each one I picked out resembled the lady I gave it to!  Just a little something fun :)
B000XE1ZI4|1|Not at all impressed. My feet are in pretty great shape to begin with, I take great care of them, so I wasn't asking much from this buffer. It still let me down. This does not remove rough spots, soften, smooth or at all improve the condition of your feet I have liked almost every other product I have ever tried better that this one. SO disappointing.
B000FTYOQC|5|they trully are great for dry skin,I do recommend!!
B000GP78S6|5|If I even think about face lotion, I tend to break out. I was shocked and pleased after I risked an attempt at using this product. No break out! Some products say they're hypo-allergenic but they lie. This is no lie. No Smell, no grease, no mess. A very good product.
B000XUSOKK|1|The Lasting Performance Foundation arrived quickly in a padded envelope.  I would have prefered sturdier packaging, perhaps bubble-wrapped in a foam-filled box?  The black bottom lid had shattered in shipping, no problem for me...I simply used one that I found on an empty Max Factor container.  I took a chance on the shade without seeing it in person.  It was way too dark and chalky for me.
B000VOJF2E|1|I BUY THIS PARFUM  AND WAS OPEN WITHOUT PRESSURE HAS BEEN THE WORST BUY
B003H146PY|5|Ok as others I had my doubts. The product definatly gives you an edge with the ladies when you wear it. Just one spray in my neck area  which I rubbed my wrist on too) and poof the party was on. The scent on this is fine. Smells like a pleasant cologne and its fine as is.
B007SPPLO0|5|I've been dying my hair for years now, mostly using Manic Panic, but I couldn't get my hands on orange Manic Panic, so I ordered this. I dyed my hair in April, with a root touch up in May, and it is now September and the color has not faded at all from what I can tell. I was even on TV and the color popped so much on screen.<br />I'm actually a little upset that it's lasted so long, currently, because I want to dye my hair purple or lime green now, but I don't want to bleach hair. But hey, that's better than having to go the whole summer re-dying my hair every other week or so. I love the color, in fact, the first week when I dyed my hair, I ordered three more boxes of this because I thought it would fade and I would have to fix it - but I haven't used them yet.<br />This is a great color, and it lasts... (which is not something I would say of all Splat dyes, but this one really sticks.) There is no fading, AND no bleeding in the shower (when the color runs from your hair and -often- stains the shower). Great dye, great color, I would definitely recommend this to any stranger (but perhaps not to a friend or family member - because I like being the only one with orange hair in the group).
B00T8T22WI|1|Nothing happened just lost money
B000PW9OF0|5|I don't wash my hair everyday--too dry--so these sheets are an answer to a prayer---add just enough moisture and styling to pop my \\"do\\" right back in place.
B0085RZLQ8|5|My dentist complimented my teeth at the last check-up.  Said cleaning for him was easy and asked how I kept my teeth so healthy and gum-tooth separation was at a minimum.  I credit it to my Sonicare.
B000P27AZ6|5|I have always loved Glow After Dark. It was shipped fast and came right on time. I had received it in about 4 days, from the time I purchased it.
B00HOHLKY2|5|Great Serum. I put it on after cleansing. All organic no smell at all. I love the eye gel too!
B002A8JO48|5|Having begun my shaving career using a safety razor and later transitioning to the assortment of two, three and even four blade models, I have returned to the original to obtain the closest and most comfortable shave. The Merkur is an excellent choice with fine machining. The Merkur or Feather blades last at least a week. The shave is close but very smooth and comfortable.<br /><br />Setting the blade and removal of a used one takes but a few moments...to be sure the old Gillette that opened and the blade carriers that you didn't have to touch would be safety improvements, but really not necessary. A good buy that will last a lifetime.
B0036FTF9I|5|My wife wanted me to get this. Against my better judgement I did. What a surprise. A really nice cologne that lasts without being obnoxious.
B00942W51C|5|This powder is everything that everyone said it was! I love it!
B0002KU6GG|1|I definitely didn't like this pumice as much as my others.  It falls apart with purple pieces going all over and doesn't quite get my hand callous off the way the other pumices i've had.
B003GC4GH2|5|LoBelt lavender scent. Soothes my feet wonderfully. Good value.
B007UT032Y|4|I like the fact that the individual Wahl cutting guides are organized. I gave my husband the perfect haircut, but the only issue is that it was a bit snug and made it a little difficult to quickly switch out combs. Otherwise, it is sold at a very reasonable price. They were very useful, as well as durable.
B0040QZU64|4|Nice, but gave me allergy on my neck
B0015V2HNQ|5|I always enjoy using this product. The  Only problem is that I sometimes have a difficult time locating this product..
B009K2BAZ8|1|Not good. Only lasted about 3 months, but the lighting isn't very strong. Not worth it.
B002LQN210|5|This stuff is great!! Total shine and dries quickly. The only negative for me is the smell - it's a little stong but does go away once it dries and you wash your hands!
B00KYZA8DA|5|So glad I found this mouth guard for my night time teeth grinding.  My dentist wanted me to pay over $500 for a custom mouth guard (that was AFTER insurance).  This works just as well and saved our family a lot of money.  The fitting was easy and I don't notice it at all when I sleep.  The customer service (Angela) is second to none.  She emailed me after I got it with detailed instructions.  My first attempt at forming the impression was easy and I did a pretty good job, but I accidentally made it slightly off center.  Angela sent me a new one right away.  I loved this so much I recommended it to my brother and now want to fit one for my daughter.  Thanks again.
B008PJZXT6|5|Easy to use...wonderful results.  Soooooo much easier than any pedi foot product I have tried in the past.  Best of all super fast..and no my feet are not rhino feet. However..my husbands are and he achieved great results as well (using his own rollers). I chose the electric model because I am tired of feeding landfills and this product is something I will always use in the privacy of my home. Enjoy!
B00JJB1PPK|5|***Full disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.***<br /><br />These are by far my favorite set of travel bottles!  I travel often, but my trips are usually just a few days.  So I need travel bottles that meet with carry-on requirements and these travel bottles from Dot&Dot are perfect for both short and long term trips.<br /><br />This product came in a medium size, clear, TSA approved toiletry bag.  These travel bottles feel very soft and flexible as they are made out of 100% BPA free food grade silicone.  I loved that these travel bottles are 3oz. each which is the perfect size for travel and it still meets TSA regulations.<br /><br />I really liked that these travel bottles from Dot&Dot have suction cups on the back.  However, as listed this is definitely not for permanent placement, just as a quick hands free solution.  I also really liked the pre-printed ID labels which allows for quick identification of the contents inside the bottles.<br /><br />I love how easy the product comes out of these bottles with just a gentle squeeze.  These Dot&Dot Travel Bottles are also just as easy to refill as they have large openings.  I really like that these bottles can be safely washed in the dishwasher on the top rack.  This totally makes for easy cleanup and to be able to constantly change out the contents of the bottles.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that everything tends to stick to these bottles.  I am constantly pulling off my hair, cat hair, dust, and lint off the bottles.  The benefits of these bottles significantly outweigh this annoyance.  Just beware that you will need to delint your travel bottles.<br /><br />I will absolutely continue to use this product and will be bringing these Dot&Dot Travel Bottles with me on all my trips.  I also completely recommend this product to everyone.  These Dot&Dot Travel Bottles are stylish, convenient, leak proof, and TSA approved.
B001A43ELC|5|Ok, so I have to say this stuff is amazing!!!!  I love the pretreatment oil that comes with it!  Now when I say amazing, keep in mind, you are still pulling hair out of your body...still hurts.    Recommendation!  Go to salon and get a Brazilian!  Have her remove it all as it is a lot of work to get the stubborn hairs yourself.  Now you are set to keep your Brazilian perfect with the surgiwax!  When the hair grows in less full and coarse, you are set with this stuff!     I personally had a salon Brazilian 5 weeks ago and left the two inch strip down the middle.  I had difficulty keeping that with the surgiwax so decided to take it all off.  The wax had some difficulty with the thicker parts and it was harder for me to do it.  Eventually, I finished and have to say, am very impressed with it!  Definitely will purchase this again in the future!
B000VTQCIY|5|I use this serum with the shampoo and conditioner. I think the serum makes the difference however. When I apply it to my hair once its dry, I notice very little difference. When I apply it after I shampoo and wash my hair, I notice a HUGE difference. I have very long thick hair. I apply it while it's wet/amp and comb it in, making sure I apply enough on the ends and when it dries and I straighten my hair, it looks amazing. I definitely recommend it.
B00AFCP418|5|My son likes this body wash
B0092UD13W|5|I love this stuff as it strips all  the dirt out and leaves your hair clean. Would highly recommend to anyone.
B005VEDKE8|5|Love this
B000181TMY|5|Works as intended what more can you ask for also very sturdy and seems to hold up so far have had it for almost a year now.
B002PMLGVI|1|I give it 1 star because it didn't work for me. I'm give it 2 stars if the box had made an disclaimer letting me and all the other brunettes know it would not work for us. It specifically states it will remove red/orange/yellow tints from color treated hair, but not dark hair. Blondes, I think it'll work just fine. But, for darker hair, just pass. You'll waste your time. Not to mention you'll sacrifice your hair's health in a pointless process.
B002N5MHLU|5|I have been a devoted Braun shaver since the early 1970s.  My last Braun shaver, one of the more recent models, was burnt out by faulty wiring while on vacation, so I started looking around for a new one.  I have been disappointed by Braun over the past few years.  I saw the quality of their shavers slipping and am not a big fan of those base cleaners that require you to keep investing in their products through the life of their shavers.      I read the reviews of the Panasonic shavers and after nearly 40 years decided to jump ship.  I am delighted with the Panasonic ES-LA 63.  It is about $100 cheaper than the Braun, gives me a better and closer shave, seems of better quality, is much quieter, and now I can dispense with those costly base cleaners.  I simply clean the Panasonic every other day by using liquid hand soap and running it through its cleaning cycle under the tap.     Braun is spending too much on advertising and too little on product quality and performance.  Don't be fooled.      I have had my Panasonic for a couple of months now and couldn't be more pleased. I have never taken the time to write a review on Amazon, but I am totally sold on this model shaver and wanted to pass it on.  Way to go, Panasonic!
B009NTBSXC|5|Exactly what I wanted. and a fair price. thanks for asking
B0030F1B3M|3|I haven't really noticed a difference since I started using it three weeks ago.  I'll give it more time and see.
B000NWDSAE|3|I was hoping this was more similar to apricot scrub but the microbeads are much smaller and less noticeable.  Soap has a nice sent and almost a menthol type freshness after using.  Will be going back to a differ facial scrub once this is done. I prefer st ives apricot scrub personally.
B0035HIGGA|4|works great but refills are a little pricey.  But you dont have much waste so they last longer than other soap dispensers.
B001FB5HYC|1|I have finished the entire tube and, after brushing twice a day, my teeth aren't any whiter. Don't waste your money
B00I7PK3GQ|5|I love this product. Period.
B00IK8E6CC|5|This product really works. It is very easy to use and comes with lots of moisture. I have combination skin-- oily in t-tone but dry in other areas. I felt the change right after using it. The dry flaky parts of my skin are gone. My face feels very juicy and smooth with a healthy glow. I was worried that the moisture might make my oily t-zone worse but it didn't. It actually helped to calm the oily parts. I'm very happy to come across this brand and this mask. It definitely will be part of my beauty regime!
B002NPSUAM|4|This is a lovely fragrance! I went into Sephora and sampled it.  It's deep and sensual and sexy. I had to buy it right away! Great stuff!
B004HYRHEM|3|I love the idea of combining lash serum with eyeliner, especially since I use eyeliner almost every day to give some definition to my smaller eyes and relatively thin lashes. I can't really judge yet about how well the lash serum worked since I haven't consistently used the product, but I found the liner a little hard to manipulate to get a thin, natural line, especially for my own light eyes. The brush is plenty small--and it may be my lack of technique, but I found myself needing to smudge the line a bit to eliminate the uneven strokes or even to add another liner on top of this one to fill in. I'll definitely keep working with it since the price is pretty good.
B000CNME3G|2|PERFUME DOES NOT SMELL FRESH, AS IF IT HAS BEEN STORED FOR A LONG TIME.  IT WAS THE LAST ONE IN STOCK.  IS IT STILL AVAILABLE ?  CAN IT BE REPLACED?
B003K703TS|5|I love this cream -- its smell, above all, but also its softening and freshening effects on my skin -- but it's getting very hard to find!  has it been discontinued?
B00B8AK678|5|The packaging was very secure and good enough to keep the cocoa butter until it's ready for use, was very clean and smooth feel. Loved it!
B00DIRCOTC|4|It is adorable and I am glad I got such a good deal on it, however, it does not straighten like other chi's. Maybe my expectations were too high! I am still glad I purchased it though.
B0016D4RQS|5|Slow burning for a long lasting scent, and this package has a great variety of scent. Will purchase again.
B0072CY79Y|1|This is some of the worst smelling after shaves I have ever used. Remember this is just my opinion and you may like it. But in all honesty, I can't stand the smell of this stuff.<br /><br />I will be sticking to Clubmans regular line of after shave and the Bay Rum that they make. That stuff smells fantasic. This does not!
B00DG7YJQA|4|Nice brush  Sturdy.  Bristles are pretty stiff.
B000C1VWSG|5|Love it !!
B00AB1F1QQ|5|Great fragrance ever! if you like to smell it on you hours after you put it on, BOD is it. it lasts very long and Don't meed much.
B004UKSKCQ|5|Very satisfied with
B00CHTX1AS|5|It's awesome!!!!
B0057YYLYK|5|It really helped prevent skin irritation from the nasal pillows!  I use it every night now.
B001DKOA6G|1|Cheap product that I would never install in our home - almost false advertising as the bronze finish is very low class and the mechanics are very fragile and stiff.
B006Z8BN02|5|Love it..!!!  Hair feels so soft afterwards!
B004OYWQ5U|1|I took this bottle to the Clarins headquarters and they informed me that is not a product of Clarins. So it is fake. Disappointing.
B0006LV9S0|5|le produit est neuf , exactement comme décrit sur l'annonce , assez abordable , et livraison rapide. un plaisir de faire affaire avec ce vendeur
B00CTJ4ZL0|5|Very clever product--keeps hair spray off face and ears.
B0051E3426|4|These are actually pink with blue tips (just like in the youtube video for Taylor Swift curls that sent me looking for them). They work really good if you do it on almost dry/dry hair. If you do it with wet hair you end up with a frizzy fro. They aren't the most comfortable to sleep in but if you position them right then its fine. They are a great product for no heat curls and I would definitely recommend them!
B009UV46AU|5|A barber friend introduced me to this and it has been pretty awesome with my hair.  I used to use gel and glue and such a while back, but was annoyed with how if it was messed up it would become white or flakey.  This stuff seems to hold up and actually looks better once my hair is messed up a little.  My hair has a natural curl/wave to it and with this stuff I am able to get my hair pretty straight.  On days I am looking to have fun I use this to spike my hair or build a faux hawk and it doesn't disappoint, if I used gel or glue with my hair  it would begin to curl a little before it was even dried. And beyond all of that, the stuff smells awesome.
B00IMHN0B4|5|SMELLS GREAT. VERY SOOTHING. I MIX IT WITH WITCH HAZEL. GREAT BRAND.
B0011UR1H8|4|I have used before and really liked it but, haven't had a chance to use it since I received this one. But, getting prepared. Cheap and good.
B00EOUM8RA|4|Seems like the other reviews about &#34;could hold lather better&#34; are accurate, but this shaving cream seems to be good and doesn't have really any scent to note (thankfully it is actually &#34;fragrance free&#34;). leaves my face feeling smooth (not like I've just run a lawnmower over it), and the little amount i put on the brush seems to last (i just re-lather every section of face i shave).<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the &#34;no super-crazy ingredients&#34; in it, and am trying to move towards creams that have pretty straightforward ingredients.....you know........like &#34;natural&#34; ingredients.
B000E7SS6M|5|This is an amazing scent from Burberry, VERY hard to find but so wonderful.<br />One thing that catches my attention is the uniqueness especially coming from a scent that is made from such light casual tones. At least try it. :)<br /> If you enjoy this try STELLA from stella mccartney[[ASIN:B00021B30S Stella McCartney Stella]]
B000YYHQPY|1|This pen did nothing at all to help my writing. It did not fit properly in my hand.<br />The circular ring area wobbled around and actually caused my writing to be worse then it was to begin with.<br />I feel the pen from the palm area to the fingertip was way too thin for it to give me a good hold.<br />A thicker pen would have been much better for me.<br />Maybe it will help some people, but it surely did not work for me.
B00F991I2Q|4|Very fast shipping got it 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date. The color of the dress is lighter than in the picture though but still is very pretty. I ordered a large and the dress fits skin tight &#34; as in it shows off all your curves&#34; the dress is the extract length as in the picture if you don't want people to see something when you bend over don't bend over even a little but it's pretty short. But overall I'm pretty happy with my purchase
B003ZYIPGO|5|Awesome product
B007Y54KG4|5|Good
B0079LIVWW|5|Easy to use, works well.  I found the best way to give pill medications to cats is to crush them, and mix with food.
B000H6A02A|5|This razor works perfect for me.  Some say it's loud but to me I don't pay attention.  What I look forward to is a good clean shave and this razor does that.  I do have to admit that my last razor was Braun and it didn't do anything for me.  Remington is the brand of shaver I will ever use.
B005XAUHEQ|4|I really loved this nail rack and it was very easy to put up myself. However, I wish I counted my nail polish bottles before purchasing because they don't all fit.. :( It may look big on amazon but I would recommend getting the bigger version if your a nail polish addict like me! OPI, Marc Jacobs, Essie, Chanel, Dior, and VS nail polishes all fit perfectly. The only issue I had was with the Nicole by OPI because of the shape.
B004S37ZNK|5|This is easy to use and smells wonderful.<br />If you like Rosemary you will love this bath soak.<br /><br />The Eucalyptus is also a great product.<br />Love this line of Products and brand.
B00FZIUHL4|5|This product has helped me regrow my hair. I no longer have to wear my hat every day and feel proud of my hair. I feel so many people take it for granted and I did too until I lost it. I never will again and I am glad to have found a product that has helped me get it back.
B00LBBHYLU|4|Fun and pampering. Felt rejuvenated after
B006HCJXBM|2|Color selection is not what's n the photo, and some colors aren't as appealing as it should b....plus to many Brown's I received Whn I gotten it
B000P5ZOJW|4|I purchased this product because it claims to be oil-free.  In comparison to others it does not feel as greasy or thick as some sunblocks.  I would like for it to be a little more matte finish, but not sure if there is truly such a thing when it comes to sunblocks.  Over all I am satisfied with this product.
B00EPEIZ22|5|Works great!
B008BHE3E8|5|Provides firm, soft, small wrinkle healing formula that tightens every pore of your skin.
B00H4GOWVG|2|what I received is not the same as the picture.
B000VSYD4K|5|Perfect size...not too big, or small...last super long...basic black goes with everything.  Getting harder to find in stores, and now with the add on, on amazon, will keep them on wish list when I am a few dollars short for the free shipping.
B007BLN17K|2|The brushes were not as fine as I thought they would be. The way they packaged them they were bent when I got them
B000C1VWSG|5|I ordered this product and it arrived within a week and it was new and was exactly what I ordered.  Thnank you!!
B000B63RNA|1|Not sure what others got.  I got a package of six that were not uniform...but all unsatisfactory.  Too small for my average-size features.  The patch itsself is just a fold of material eventually leaving an open slit.  Interferes with the eyelids and eyelashes.  Sharp points on the patch in the way it is sewn.  I threw them all away and will get more someplace else.  The one from the &#34;home brand&#34; pharmacy is ok in general...and far superior to these.
B00CA05FKI|3|I wanted to love this shampoo but it left a bit to be desired. It did leave my hair very soft and shiny but it was simply too heavy for my hair. I have baby fine, straight hair that falls just past my shoulders and this product really weighed it down. My hair felt greasy within a day of washing with this shampoo. It smelled nice, just wasn't the right product for me.
B005N9BZU2|5|I bought this 6-pack so that I could try on the various scents offered by this product line.  I now carry one of them in my purse and plan to give others away as gifts to friends.
B0043X2N50|2|I should have believed other reviewers who said this did not snap onto pails, but just lodged atop them.  I had pails from OSH, Home Depot, and Lowes, and thought/hoped it would fit snugly on one of them.  It doesn't.  I'm disabled due to stroke and have balance problems, so this is useless to me.  I will keep it in case someone with me gets &#34;caught short&#34;, but probably should return it instead.
B000KEIPC6|5|personally I love this! Since it is waterbased it isn't as permanent as the Molding Clay, which is what I moved to, but I absolutely love this product.
B00181OKDI|5|Fast delivery and Wen is best for hair.  No longer is my fine hair limp and oily looking.  Love the fluff and flow.  No need to use extra products on hair.  Just a small dollop of wen as a leave in conditioner and hair can air dry or blow dry without the frizz.  Thanks seller..I do recommend you highly..A+ to you.
B00H33ZDSQ|5|I got these as gifts and they are prefect for my brothers. Since they are now in sports the bag comes in handy and they don't have to worry about anything spilling on clothes or anything else. The bag is also very nice and made well. They made great gifts!
B005V4ZOT2|5|This smells right, and it's the best price I found for this oil. I'm happy with the quality. I would buy this again.
B00BB17Y1K|5|Great
B00O3GTL3O|3|Could have fit a little better. My 5 year old has trouble getting it to cover the front of her forehead.but other than that it's soft and looks good!
B0047PSV14|1|the lights do not stay on, I would not recommend this item.  To fix or replace cost as much as the unit!
B006UET4XE|5|Super pleasantly surprised by how excellent this black liquid eyeliner is. I am a devotee of Stila who's gone on a budget. Doubted this product could possibly live up to my Stila-high standards. But it met and even maybe exceeded them, as I haven't had to recut or trim the tip at all yet to keep the line. It's awesome.
B001AZJVGS|1|This cleanser should come with a warning label. I first used it on a Saturday night...my skin felt a little tight afterwards but nothing major. By Monday I had a full face of what looked like measles, but measles with little white heads. I am 37 years old, have generally good skin...maybe a slight bit sensitive...but I have NEVER had a reaction to a skincare product like this in my life. It is now Wednesday night and my skin shows no signs of improving even though I stopped using this horrific product 2 days ago.
B000FTIYWM|5|I have a relatively oily face and until now, I've either dried my face out with all kinds of facial cleansers or over-moisterized it with various facial moisterizers.  This is the first facial application I've used that doesn't feel like a moisture cream when it goes on and that dramatically reduces my oily complexion throughout the day. As far a wrinkle reduction, maybe so but I've been more concerned with the overall condition of my skin and this product delivers.
B000TBVGBM|3|Worked great for the platinum streaks in my hair and helped to maintain color, but the majority of my blond hair (which has a brassy tone to it) actually became more brassy and dark with each use!! I was hoping this product would remove the brass from my hair, but it didn't do that, quite the opposite in fact. If the day ever comes where I go completely platinum, I would definitely use this shampoo.<br />Until then, I wouldn't recommend this shampoo to people trying to fix their brassy tone.
B000WGGB3W|5|This is a very good latex product. It dries fast enough that you're not waiting around forever, trying not to spoil your makeup, but slowly enough that you have time to get it just right. Not as much of a smell as other latex products, and it disappears completely when dry. One tip--buy it in large quantities to save money, then transfer it to smaller airtight bottles to avoid the product drying out over time.
B00QR2LX38|4|This is my go to pomade right now. The hold is decent, I have longer hair on top that I slick back and at times it does fall out of place. Unfortunately remolding it with water doesn't always do the trick. I also love the barbershop smell. The can claims &#34;all natural&#34; but when you flip it over and look at the ingredients.. it's far from. Not sure how that works. Four stars for now because I haven't found anything better.
B006K9OQSC|4|I just receive the product but it is four foam for make-up.... Anyway, I have to purchase again because I really need it...
B004INUWX0|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Spin Air! It doesn't work well with really wet hair but after my hair was 80% dry I finished with my Spin Air and it curled my hair with out having to use my flat iron to tame the frizzies! It didn't tangle even when I pushed the spin direction in the wrong direction!
B000SB86AW|5|This is the best sun burn relief too bad they no longer make this new one is not the same
B0044YHZ1U|5|I really like this soap.  It is very non irritating and doesn't leave that film like deodorant soap does.  My husband is very oily and this soap doesn't exacerbate that problem.  He stays clean and way less oily through out the day.  Excellent soap.  And the coconut gives it a nice scent.
B000KONYJK|2|guess it doesnt work for all. cant say its done anything for my neck. still look old
B00G67HY7S|5|I like it
B000Q6D3MA|5|I loved the oatmeal in it it was great removed old skin and left a great gay smell I felt 100% homo
B001SBUOE2|4|As much as I want to rate it 5 stars (as I love this product!)  its just out of my budget for such things...On another note it IS worth the money.    As a shampoo it is VERY versatile,  I use it (waist length, thick, oily/ but dry roots hair) my mother does (shoulder length, frizzy, chemically damaged, greying, dry, colored hair) and sometimes my brother does as well.  It improves the look of all our hair so much!  This also helps our dandruff problems.      The bottle lasts a very long time.  We've had the same bottle for two months, being shared between two people regularly.  We probably use less than we should use, but even so it still works.  If I hold out my hand flat, I use enough to fill the little bowl my hand creates, very small.  For other shampoos it usually takes  5, 6 times the amount w/ my length of hair.  And to think it works so much better!    The last thing I want to mention is that if your hair doesn't sqeuak afterwords thats a good thing!  Shampoos that do that cause this take ALL the oils out of the hair, even the necessary good ones.  Which of course is bad for the look of your hair. Arbonne doesn't do this, and it doesn't leave your hair greasy either.    I can't remember exact details, but what arbonne advertises about this line is all true in my case.  Remember though, its different for some people.  Even though it works perfectly for me and my mother there is always a chance a hair care product will not work for you.  I can say that I know tons of people who use this and I haven't heard any complaints about it working.
B00UEC9Y3S|5|So far I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now and my breasts are definitely more firm and I hope to see them increase a bit with the next jar!
B00ARIYMRM|5|This is my favorite shampoo, great for damaged hair<br />I use it for 2 yeas already<br />Did not find any replacement. The best!
B00FPN05SO|5|Love this stuff! It works! and it's safe for me to use and not worry about if my children touch it.
B005XEIQ4A|5|This product is wonderful!  It makes my skin silky soft and the foundation just flows on.  Thank you for such a wonderful product.
B0014ZR30K|5|Thank you so much for the product I ordered!  It came very quickly and was in perfect condition!  I will definately purchase from you again!  Thank you!
B000KEOO2Q|5|it totally matches what I thoght.  it has good shape and operations. At first, I just feel a little expensive, but after using it, I think it deserves that.
B00D0ANSAG|5|Great blenders.  Love them.
B0036H5R0C|5|first off i love this perfume, first time smelling it and i'm hooked.<br />and it arrived when it was supposed to.  -I'll be back :)
B001RMP7M6|5|This item is worth the money if you like UV gel top coats. Works great and you will spend less in the long run!
B004ZJX572|5|love it
B001ABLKK2|5|This is a wonderful, mild cleanser. My face feels clean but not overstripped.
B00BOV76UQ|5|Wonderful lotion especially great for my dry skin!
B001E96NWU|5|Just right for the harsh dry  winter of 2015.
B000MANVMC|4|The product arrived on time but the plastic was open and one of the jar was only half full. :( I have been getting this item for a long time and this is the first time it happened. Quality of the remaining part appear to be the same. I love this product and prefer not to share it anyone I don't know.
B005V247N8|5|These brushes are a solid buy!  Feel great, great density.  Arrived really quickly.  Pretty certain it will be hard to find this nice of quality brushes at retailers or elsewhere for this price.  This particular series of brushes is a keeper.  Mac and Sephora still have higher product quality overall, but this specific collection of brushes is solid for the price.    Beware tho, while this collection is great, I did return the other collection (Sigma Beauty 12pcs. Professional Brush Set) because I feel that there are equally decent brushes of that quality at retailers such as Target and Ulta in term of quality and price.
B0039TQ6E8|2|I purchased this dryer from Sephora and paid $175.00 for it thinking it would hold up. First thing I noticed was the concentrator nozzle kept spinning around and falling off during use.  Also it was very heavy. Dried my hair pretty fast. But after not quite one year of use, it's making a horrible loud grinding noise. Keep in mind I only use this dryer every four days and I'm very careful with my expensive hair tools. For such a pricey hair dryer, the nozzle design was extremely disappointing and the fact that it's already broken after not even one year of lite use. Also the control switches are placed awkward as well as the lint catcher requires you to unscrew these microscopic screws in order to clean. Over all, a very poor design.<br />I have since done a lot of research on different companies that manufacture hair dryers and I noticed from their website,  Sultra specializes more in flat irons or curling irons and has limited choices on hair dryers. So I've decided no more Sultra hair dryers for me. I've now replaced this Sultra with a Italian made SuperSolano as it did get really good reviews and is powerful. And it's super lite and the concentrator is nice and snug. It was also less expensive than the Sultra.
B000SMPI5M|3|These are a small size, probably a 6 or 7.  I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't include a size on the package!
B005FCD4B0|5|Absorbed smoothly into skin. Very good esp. in dry season and skin.
B0000CBJ5M|5|I bought two, one for my son and one for my husband.  Son has opened and used it.  He loved it so much he told me to write a 5 star review.  He had a Norelco but says this is a top of the line comfortable close shave.  5 star quality and price...love the cleaning feature!!!
B001AJ6YS2|3|Was working fine, then one day I decided to do like the picture shows and rinse it under a tap. Almost instantly, the top falls into the sink and comes apart, I then lose 2 of the 3 little plastic pieces that sit on the blades down the drain. The replacement heads cost just as much as the freaking shaver itself!!!! Also, I don't even know if the replacement heads will even include those tiny plastic parts...still an alright shaver, just seriously want to punch the guy who thinks you can rinse it like that directly in the middle of his face.
B00AKNST4G|3|I got this in the mail and it was not what I was expecting at all! The picture I had when I chose to purchase this product was totally different. It is an ok case and it works great for traveling, but the stylus pen it mentioned in the  description was nowhere to be found. I'm still deciding if I like the fit of it or not.
B000ELP5KA|5|Great!
B0080CO2F4|5|I like the bright colors in this and also the way it is versatile in the ways you can place it in your hair.
B00943D1JQ|5|A great shampoo that adds body and the right kind of oil.  It is not heavy or flattening.  I love this product.
B007IFAWLW|5|Love this conditioner - works well with shampoo - lots of moisture - don't have 8 more words words words
B000MGSJFK|5|I add a little bit to my lotion, and it ramps up the moisture! Very inexpensive for a lot of bang!
B00GPHIDT2|5|Great !!
B001LFHKN8|5|Great!
B00O13M70I|5|Very nice and a tremendous value for vertiver. Great follow through and super fast shipping from this company.
B0065I0UMO|3|Good
B00CUGP8J0|5|This is the first time I've ordered eye makeup remover pads. I am impressed by the quality and convenience! Don't think I'll ever go back to what I was using. I highly recommend it and will definitely reorder.
B00OUPS012|5|Very satisfied!
B005QT6WGG|5|sensational, really!! great price point for an exclusive line.  many compliments and lasts and long time on the body.  generous amount for the price.  Im hooked for LIFE!!
B000RGZK02|5|It's good
B0061DPB04|1|I love mane n tail but this is not worth it at all I paid almost $30 in total with tax and shipping expecting 2 large bottles since for 7.99 at a retail store that's what u get but I open my package and had 2 extra small bottles.. I've never even seen bottle this small sold in stores very disappointing!! For $14 u get two large bottles at Kmart and they usually have buy one get one free!! But it did make my hair really shiny, probably not good news to some one who has naturally greasy hair or thin hair! Won't buy these from here again, in store would be WAAYY cheaper!
B0081NLR8M|5|I have been using Olay products since I was about 17. I am 47 now, I seen this in stores but was a little skeptical about how well it would work, I have only been using it for a couple of weeks and I can already see the difference, I love it.
B0018DAUDK|5|Perfect for the everyday wearing and just enough of that pop to wear out on the town in the evenings.
B001T0HHBK|4|My hair is somewhere between curly and straight, which you would think would make it easy to go either way. In fact, my hair is like a petulant teenager, stubbornly refusing to do whatever it is I'm trying to get it to do. As such, I wasn't too surprised that this didn't curl my hair any better than any of the other tools I've used. It seems rollers left in overnight are the only way to get curls to stay for me; otherwise it looks great for about five minutes, then falls flat. But this is an excellent straightening iron, great for flipping the ends under, heats up almost instantly, and curls almost as well as a curling iron, with fewer tangles.
B0049LUI9O|5|I own a few other panasonic units from long ago.  They ripped the hair out of my nose and it hurt.  This one is EXCELLENT.  it is quiet.  it works on the nose and ears and even the face.  huge improvement in quality and it uses AA battery! I am so so happy I bought this
B000052X9F|5|I have worn this deodorant for at least 30 years. It keeps me dry and I have never had an oder.I prefer the unscented as it doesn't have to fight with the perfume that I where.
B00DX046J0|5|I liked the brown color from my Hazel eyes trio, but only wanted the color separate from the others, but could never find it. It came wrapped very well. No problems!
B001SGLDCO|5|You can get these for ~$1.60 at Walgreens. However, my husband always uses this brand and has no complaints. We would definitely not buy it for this price, though.
B00385WMJ6|5|I read the reviews about the flowers fading or rubbing off? Something like that and I almost did not purchase this shower cap. I've been using this for about 3 months now and it still looks just like it looked when I took it out of it's package. It's a good shower cap, holds my thick, long hair and the elastic keeps is tight enough to not let any water in. I will purchase another just like this one when this one is no longer usable. If you are looking at this and trying to decide what to do, I say, get yourself one!
B002DOO1VA|4|These brushes are a great value for the price!!! They are really nice brushes, thick not this quality. The only thing i didnt like is that they didnt have written on the brush what each brush is. Other than that I would totally reccomend these!
B00OWLTUWC|5|I never thought I would get rid of my peeling lips!
B000OYJ8UU|5|this is the best stuff for elbows and feet,im sold
B00ADJEUAY|5|i love all of the products from this brand.  the ingredients are organic and the price is right.  the smell is fresh and natural.  great for kids or adults.
B00L0R5494|5|Love my eye shadow.
B00684K71Y|3|I am a licensed hair Stylist.  I purchased this to create dreadlock extensions.  I will list the pros and the cons of this product.<br /><br />Pro-<br />1), Large quantity of hair for the price compared to other brands,<br />2) I can create a realistic/decent looking dreadlock extention.<br /><br />Cons -<br /> 1) working with natural afro hair this product absolutely does not appear to be 100% human.  My opinion is that &#34;The Vivica Fox Human Afro soul kinky bulk hair&#34;  is blended with synthetic fibers, or a horrible chemical process attempting to alter straight hair to intimate someones version of 'afro kinki&#34; hair.<br />2)  my experience has been impossible to lighten the hair color.  All professional attempts barely lighten the color but it oddly straighten the hair. texture.<br />3) The hair can unravel at the ends unless you use a specific technique to secure it at the ends.<br /><br />Basically it is a decent product especially for the money.  I think it's good for temporary braids, twist and  dreadlock extentions as long as you install it using the same technique as me unless it will likely unravel.  If you are looking for authentic true 100% human hair that you can color/lighten do NOT buy this product because you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />But if you want braids or dread lock extentions etc using this product is affordable.  I suggest that you purchase the hair in the color you want just know you will be stuck with that color because it is difficult to dye.  I only attempted to lighten the color not darken it so I don't know if you will have a diffuclt time changing a light color to dark.  But i do now any attemots to lighten the hair color changes/straightens the hair texture.<br /><br />I rate this product with 3 stars only because the label says &#34;100% human hair&#34;. This advertisement is misleading and deceptive to the consumer. because 100% human hair implies that it can be colored etc.  If the owners were to correct the label to read &#34;blended hair&#34; or place a disclaimer inicating that &#34;although it reads Human Hair its unable to color&#34; then I will rate it 4 1/2 stars. Otherwise it's deciving the customer who thinks they are paying for a certain quality of hair.<br /><br />if ANYONE know of a successful technique to lighten this hair without altering the &#34;afro kinki&#34; texture PLEASE let me know.<br />If I learn of a way to lighten the color I will update this review.  Soooo keep checking back.<br /><br />Thank you34;although it reads Human Hair its unable to color&#34; then I will rate it 4 1/2 stars.

B007G03JTQ|5|My acne specialist recommended this sunscreen to me and I am very happy with it. I needed something that was very water-resistant (I swim and run outside quite a bit),  wouldn't break me out or leave me super shiny. This one is super effective. You don't have to worry about reapplying and it actually makes my skin appear smoother and more even-toned. I'm pretty tan with yellowish/olive undertones and this sunscreen doesn't leave me looking whitish or bluish.
B00AVQ0LY8|5|It works great
B001SZ3K4Y|4|as advertised
B003TQU1Q0|5|Simply Fantastic!
B005B3OBM4|5|I have combination skin and have tried several Eminence Products such as the Bright Skin, Eight Greens, Red Currant, and the Firm Skin Acai moisturizers . My main skin concerns are brown spots (melasma), loss of firmness, and tendency to break out on a monthly basis. Of all the Eminence products, this moisturizer has worked out the best for me, plus I like that it has high SPF protection included. The eminence website provides product recommendations by allowing you to enter your main skin concerns. I have been using the Persimmon Cantaloupe moisturizer during the day and the Eight Greens Youth serum by itself at night. This combination has worked out good for me thus far. As for the moisturizer, just be sure not to over do it on the amount because it you use too much of it, it may start peeling. However, this has not been a major problem and I believe the amount I use is enough to moisturize and provide SPF protection.
B002W0AU0G|5|The Clinicure Botanical Nourish (shampoo) is great, I love the tingle that your head/hair feel and it cleans without stripping my hair which is very fraigle.  It is great!!
B00E0T1FOM|5|After I used the peel the first time, I felt and saw an immediate difference in my skin - - so smooth! The instructions are very thorough (and do make sure you read through all the precautions & &#34;boring, but important&#34; stuff before you attempt to use it) I put one layer on starting out and I wait a week in between peels. I'm now on peel #3 and I put two layers on for a little stronger peel.  I didn't experience any bad side effects with this peel other than just a tiny bit of expected redness (more of a flush/blushed look) which went away in about an hour.  My face also feels warm for the rest of the day following a wrap, but I'm always cold - so I find it a plus!! I've always been very into skin care and have tried to take good care of it through the years, but this peel has really taken my skin to the next level.  I highly recommend it!!
B0046HGJV2|5|Because I have loved Curl Junkie products since I discovered them early in 2010, I was fortunate enough to be asked to test this gel before it went to market. I went bonkers. At that time, I called it \\"Mystery Gel\\" in the pics I uploaded for fellow curlies on Naturally Curly dot Com's Curltalk forum to show the marvelous result. Now, we know it was CurlQueen.<br /><br />This is a liquidy gel that manages to give clumping results with medium, non-crunchy(for me, anyway) hold. I hate crunch and I hate drying gels, so I sometimes just skip gel or use Abba Pure Style medium hold, no glycerin gel. My hair gets frizzy with glycerin, and this one actually calms frizz on me. The scent (not my fave, but this one I can tolerate) is a tea-based floral that will seem very strong when you open the bottle, but calms alot once on hair. So that's good.<br /><br />I've used this on top of various products (Re:coil, Flaxseed gelee, Spiral Solutions CEJ, Curl junkie Smoothing Lotion) and it gives consistently nice results.<br /><br />This gel gave me my best hair days this past hot, hot, hot summer. I rarely had out of control summer frizz this year. I even did a \\"beach test\\" with it back in May and it majorly minimized the curl destrcution and frizz creation after a couple hours on Hollywood Beach.<br /><br />If you have hair like mine--dry, fine, protein-loving, glycerin-hating--this is for you.<br /><br />If you don't hair like mine, but want to try a quality medium-hold gel that won't dry out your locks, look at the specs for this and see what you think. Over at Curl junkie dot com, there is a selection guide that tells you what products will work for your hair. See if CurlQueen qualifies. And the company's founder/head posted a recent blog post at the Curl Junkie Blogspot dot Com with suggestions on how to use this product.<br /><br />My totally fave gel.<br /><br />Oh, and if your hair loves aloe and doesn't mind glycerin, the Aloe Fix Lite may be better for you. One of these gels will surely make your hair happy.<br /><br />So glad it's finally out and I can use as much as I want. :D<br /><br />You can find pics of me testing it at the MirCurls at Fotki in May of 2010 (while testing it) and July 31 (on a humid deep summer day) and in the September/October 2010 folder after I got a bottle in early October.<br /><br />Happy curls to you..<br /><br />Mirnally out and I can use as much as I want. :D    You can find pics of me testing it at the MirCurls at Fotki in May of 2010 (while testing it) and July 31 (on a humid deep summer day) and in the September/October 2010 folder after I got a bottle in early October.

B008JH1CB2|5|this product is too perfect !! and its super cheap i will be ordering much more in the future (:
B000VEN3RW|5|Great for body, face, hair, goes on smooth and not oily.  It's great before apply make up or after peels to freshen up.
B00AGZEG4U|4|I ordered this after my hair dresser insisted. I do like it a lot as it is easier on my hair than a normal brush. However, I have extremely thick hair and it seems to have broken some of the bristles! Yikes! Better made for a little thinner hair I suppose.
B00LBD65TA|5|I bought this brush after watching a review on youtube... I have never used the sigma brush they compared it to so I cant comment on the similarites but I can say I love this brush! Its dense but not to the point of being hard. It feels as though you barley have any makeup on!
B00C7DYBX0|5|Must have. Fast shipment
B000NBQUNW|5|Very good product.  I'd like to re-order. Can you do this or instruct me how? I'm away on the 9th of April for several weeks.
B00ELNDKUY|3|I didn't see a dramatic difference using this expensive product on my dry/damaged processed hair.  The commericals that you see on TV makes it look like this product alone transforms your hair into luxurious shining hair.
B000US256O|5|Love this compact power. I've used this as a foundation over the last two years after experiencing severe skin issued with mineral powder foundations. It has light coverage but is enough to mask minor flaws.
B00WX1SGRI|5|oxbrite loofah woks good for me and the product came on time as promised.
B00CNTJHQO|5|I'm not normally one to try &#34;natural&#34; products, but i am hooked. I bought this shampoo recently hoping to finally find something that would help with my dandruff. I've been to doctors, been on steroid cremes for it, been to dermatologists - nothing has worked until this shampoo!! Thank you Maple Holistics for a great product. It is such a relief to finally have this under control.
B00658LP7I|4|What I like about the serum is it's non-greasy formula. It soaks right in leaving my skin smooth. My skin has a tendency to be oily by midday now I don't worry anymore. The serum can be worn day and night, I do use a different eye cream directly around my eyes since this product can make the eye area puffy if you put it too close under the eye and on the lid. The serum helps with the crows feet and my makeup stays better without all the facal oil.<br /><br />I tried some drug store face moisturizers as well as some 'natural' moisturizers you can get at a coop or natural food store, but for me, I always come back to the Meaning Beauty serum. It doesn't have sun screen so added protection is a must when out in the sun.<br /><br />Everyone's skin is finicky, whether it be because of the weather or age. I'm now in my 50's and have noticed a real difference with my skin and for some reason the Meaningful Beauty works well.
B00P1F1XKK|5|Contains liquids with no leaks even in liquids travel bag for the airplane. Seamless twist on, twist off action. Fantastic product. Would buy again.
B003KU6DQC|5|Love this shower gel. Now very hard to find. I use this with the body spray and the scented lotion
B006UET6YG|5|I'm a college student who always wake up 20 minutes before class and have 10 minutes to get ready. This serves so well as I just whip this on, put on some eyeliner, fix my brows, put on some blush -&#62; all less than 7 minutes. I always look like I spent 30 minutes to get ready because of this eye shadow. Great job Maybelline
B00FCYU4GO|5|i Know there aren't any review so let me be the first! This wig is absolutely amazing it came earlier than expected and is really nice quality! Totally worth the money
B00HN0X8ZE|5|complimented the first tme I wore it -- a lovely little ring with a big impact!
B007M81B5Q|5|Use it everyday. It's my favorite day cream. I don't have to use a heavy base since I have nothing to hide. This works wonders on skin and helps with anti aging wile I'm not even thinking about it. Love that it has sunscreen also so I use it all summer too.
B000OO0EIA|5|best cooling sunscreen with very good protection, for sports or just a holiday sunbath. Easy too use, non greasy & sticky like most sunscreens & has a nice smell which most good products don't have. I cannot understand why Switzerland doesn't sell this product, as its one of the best, I can also use it for my sensitive skin on my face without it clogging my pores. This will be the only product I will ever use going under the sun because its just perfect & I feel safe without having to worry about any sunburns.
B002RS8MWG|5|Gr8 deal for a variety of Miss Jessie's products.
B00FVZ5UFO|5|Love these brushes!! I don't know how I managed before having these brushes. They make blending your eyeshadow a breeze, well worth the $$
B00AR59PZ4|4|This seems to work pretty well. I like the lift it gives my hair. Be careful how much you use though, I have noticed it creates kind of a waxy texture after blow drying (which is good for me because I have a pixie cut, but it might not be so nice if you're going for soft silky hair)
B004YZMKKU|2|The reviews I read said it worked well & dries hair quickly. Not in my case. I have thick hair & it takes a long time to dry it. The Hot setting doesn't get hot enough.
B0036Q7ZYY|5|I have long (waist length) 2a hair (slight wave) that is fine,highly porous and severely damaged, so I try to use products that are as gentle as possible... i.e. Silicone free,sulfate free. I've been using cleansing conditioners for about a year now, and this one is the best! It's thick, creamy, evenly distributes through hair, cleanses nicely, conditions, and even smells really good! No other CC has had all these benefits for me. I have an oily scalp prone to build up, and dry hair. This cleanser managed to tame the oil AND condition my hair like a deep conditioner! I am in love! Idc that its 25 a bottle. I'd pay twice that considering how soft my hair is right now, and I will be buying the bigger bottle next!
B00147FGJ8|4|I bought this based on the 5 star reviews, and I have to admit that I am a little disappointed.  For one, I do not find the smell appealing.  It does cover that \\"just went tanning\\" smell, but it has its own weird musty smell.  Also, I haven't really noticed my tan getting any darker than it normally would.  However, I do notice that my tan seems to last longer in between my weekly maintenance sessions and it does seem to moisturize well enough.  Therefore, I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.  In no way do I consider this a 5 star lotion....if you are looking for that, I'd keep looking!
B008FPVEMU|4|Beautiful light refreshing scent.
B00BB17Y1K|4|very powerful...I can only use it 3 times a week if I don't want to be peeling excessively
B008ESAYXS|2|2 arrived in Gel form and 1 was very watery...same thing happened last year when i ordered...they must have had some that freezed at one time in a warehouse or on a truck somewhere...
B0081NLRE6|2|Made me break out.
B0039BCT56|3|it is ok
B002YFQRTC|5|This is a beautiful flower and was well packaged. Very happy with this purchase and will be a repeat customer.
B00433RN4G|1|I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND RECENTLY PURCHASED SEVERAL PENCILS FROM YOU.  I CAN NO LONGER FIND THEM IN THE STORES.  BUT AS SOON AS I STARTED TO USE THEM ON A DAILY BASIS, MY EYE LIDS WERE RED AND ITCHY.  I STOPPED USING YOUR PENCIL AND NO LONGER HAVE THE IRRITATION ON MY EYE LIDS.  DID YOU CHANGE THE FORMULA?????????  I OFTEN HAVE THAT HAPPEN, WHEN THE PRODUCT I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS, SUDDENLY CHANGES TO SOMETHING THAT NO LONGER LOOKS, FEELS OR ACTS THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL.  SORRY I PURCHASED SO MANY!!!
B00132ZG3U|2|This hair dryer is mediocre. The attachments fall off and the high/low is difficult to use while drying my hair. I gave it away.
B001MA0QY2|4|This is a good flat iron for the price. I like that it has adjustable heat settings. The only issue I have is that the on/off switch would be easier to use if it was on the outside of the unit instead of in between the ceramic plates.
B002VECJ3Y|5|This is my favorite foundation.  I've been using it for many years and haven't found anything else that compares.<br />It adds a touch of color to my face, covers up some minor redness and age spots, and removes the oily shine.<br />It covers better than a plain powder.  The sponge that comes with it is really nice, and easy to wash out.
B001KYW8MS|5|Only have to reapply after eating or brushing my teeth. Love this stuff, doesn't come off when kissing...
B000RE5R3E|3|Let me first say that I am a female, I have been in ALOT of pain for a Very long time, ankles, knees, and lower back.  Recently, my doctor recommended the Spenco Full Support Orthotics to me.  I was happy to see that I could get it here on Amazon and in the realm of things affordable.  Ordered a pair. put them in my  size 9 med. width tennis shoes then in my boots, and found them to be snug, so I trimmed them down. Read on the back that the hard plastic were moldable if needed.  Put them in my shoes, and they were VERY wide, so I followed the directions and tried to melt some of the plastic so that they would fit.  No luck.  Even took them to a shoe repair to see if they could help.  No luck, but they recommended the thin or dress shoe Spenco full length orthotic a size down, which are narrower, and did fit in my tennis shoe much better. Walked out of the store with them in my shoes.  Great Support, Great Product, Ladies my I suggest you start out with the dress orthotic if you are not a wide width.  The other pair is sitting in the box in my closet. To wide for any of my shoes, and to small for my husband shoes.
B000R80ZTQ|5|I am really happy with my purchase. I use it sparingly only for parties or functions because I believe extensive use of styler with style sprays and serums is not good for hair and scalp. I have medium length thin hair and so far it's working great for me :)
B000ICRDSW|3|ok
B003JTOS0C|5|great smelling perfume, i always get alot of compliments
B001UHXG7Q|5|I started out by buying the Thymes fig & cassis bath salts, and fell in love with the scent, nice and fresh and earthy.  They come in nice little packets that you can use to scent your drawers as well.  I then tried the lotion, as well as the air freshener which are also great.  I give these lotion/soap sets a lot as gifts, everyone just loves the fresh clean scent.
