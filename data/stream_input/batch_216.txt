B00005JKYS|5.0|This realistic movie depicts the start of the Viet Nam war in human misery and bravery.  As he did so well in THE PATRIOT, Mel Gibson performs marvelously as the American general (granted, he was no MacArthur, but who else was?!) and gives an award-winning, heart-rending, authentic acting so sincere that his tears cause the moviegoer to respond in kind.  He may be from down under, but he makes a pretty good, Southern gentleman turned soldier.  There were a few funny incidents as when the women's group talk about going to the laundry in that small Georgia town.  It breaks your heart when you see that yellow taxi's appearance; I almost had a heart attack when the general's wife looked out and saw it that last time.  Don't miss this powerful movie; it will leave you with fulfillment and the knowledge we were denied when this event actually took place.  More power to the Viet Nam vets!
0767849493|5.0|I love Dogma. I love the irreverent humor, the wonderful acting. I love the ideas it has, the possibility that religion is all wet, and the fun poked at the Catholic Church. It's funny, it's totally sacriligious, and I watch it once a week. I wish they'd come out with Dogma 2!
B00004T37H|5.0|I love this movie so much that I am gong to ask my mom if I can have it. It has a moving plot, a smashing ending, and something most movies don't have, a moral. Princess Mononoke teaches people about saving the earth. That is a job well done.
B00003CXMG|2.0|Snoozarama.  I was very disappointed; it did not live up to the hype.  It was eerily similar to \\"Rock Star\\", which in itself was very disappointing.  The characters were dull and predictable; the film had zero energy and no fire.  And what was with the scene where Kate Hudson danced alone on the gym(?) floor for 30 seconds?  What on earth did that mean?  Don't waste your time and $$$ on this one; \\"Almost Famous\\" is \\"Absolutely Awful\\".
0440178002|4.0|James Clavell is a great storyteller but he doesn't know much about human psychology. The reader may get the impression from this story that the Japanese are some sort of an alien race of suicidal maniacs. This cannot be farther from the truth. All human beings are genetically close to each other. The self-preservation gene is just as common among the Japanese as it is common among majority of human beings. A person may sacrifice his life for a blood relative (evolutionary scientists have found out that the likelihood of this sacrifice is determined by the percentage of genes shared by the particular individuals), but it is highly unlikely that one will be willing to jump off a cliff to save the life of a cruel overlord. From evolutionary point of view, this doesn't make any sense.<BR>I am not saying that the Japanese don't have their cultural peculiarities but in all cultures we see manifestation of same basic human traits: we value friendship; we love our children; we respect our parents; we love to gossip; we strive to achieve power and accumulate wealth; we love ourselves.<BR>Ritual suicide, or any other form of suicide for that matter, has never been popular in Japan. They may not have had the taboo, which Christianity imposes on self-destruction, but they certainly didn't kill themselves in any greater numbers than westerners did. <BR>It was the patriotic Japanese poets and writers of 1930s who romanticized the ritual suicides. However, it was never widely practiced in Japan at any time. It is just another myth of 20th century pop culture (and so are the horns on Vikings' helmets). <BR>Despite his superficial knowledge of history and human psychology, James Clavell proves to be a great novelist. I couldn't put this book down. The story is simply breathtaking. Read it!
B00000IAU3|5.0|She is the most refreshing artist to come out. I find that no matter how hard I try I can't bring my self to change cds. Originally I bought the cd for the song Here with me. But now you could play the whole cd all the way through and I would never get sick of it. I just can't wait until she comes out with another cd!

B00003CXI1|5.0|I saw the movie 4 times - something I've never done before!  I found it to be a wonderful retelling on J.K. Rowling's most excellent book.  Each successive time I saw it, I found something I missed and things that I eagerly anticipated seeing again.  It is wonderful to have a face to put the names to in the book.  This will make rereading them all the more enjoyable for me.  Even though the movie is almost 3 hours long, I found the time to have gone so fast that I was left wanting more.  I would have liked to have seen more than just the one Quidditch match, although that one was very thrilling to watch - made me feel like I was in the stands cheering.  I eagerly look forward to the next two movies.
0312952813|4.0|I didn't enjoy this book quite as much as i did &quot;The Black Echo&quot;, which i thought was a stunning debut novel. However, this is still a really good book. Bosch is a great character, but at times he and his superiours attitudes toward him get so frustrating!<br />The plot here is another good one, but to me seemed a little similar to the first. Maybe that's just because of the similarities brought ove rin Bosch's character. That's always a problem when you do a series. <br />Nevertheless, this book has a good plot. It's exciting and tense, and Connelly's writing is gritty and evocative. He has particular talent for the descriptions of place.<br />I would reccomend this to people who read the first one and liked it. Also, it has a really really good climax and a great twist! Definitely a high-class detective novel.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I can't believe any electro. fans don't like this disk.  It's fantastic!  Don't go into it expecting another &quot;Surrender.&quot;  It's really alot more like their old work, like &quot;Exit Plant Dust.&quot;  If you're just buying this because you heard &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; in Tomb Raider.  It's not all like that.  Sone of the best tracks to look into are &quot;My Elastic Eye&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot;, &quot;Come With Us&quot;, &quot;Denmark&quot; and &quot;The Test&quot;.  If you like dance music at all, this will be a great disk 4 U!
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is not a pop band, they are not manufactured to appeal to the masses. However, if you are actually into punk rock, and like at least one of their songs, yes, buy it! I first heard of The Strokes when I saw their video, Last Nite. I liked what I heard so I bought the album. If I could give it ten stars I would. They have a fresh and unique sound, songs that really get the adrenaline going. All of the songs have a strong beat, and catchy tune, meaningful lyrics, and incredible guitar combinations and solos. Even the baselines are hummable. Not to mention the infectiousness of the album- you'll find yourself loving them instantly, humming their songs all the time and recommending it to all your punk loving friends.    <br />Come on people- if you bought this album because it is popular, has great reviews, is selling lots, and you are giving it a bad review, give your head a shake! You should at least listen to something once before you buy it.
0060930349|2.0|This book gives a reasonably good overview of early american history until it reaches the 20th century, and then Johnson destroys his credibility by becoming a conservative apologist.  Roosevelt, Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton are demonized, while Nixon and Reagan are portrayed as giants or viticms of the left-wing media.  One of the most striking examples of this is Johnson's account of Watergate.  He describes it all as a left-wing witchhunt, led by Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, who Johnson believes let his paper pursue the story because he had a personal vendetta against Nixon.  Johnson does not mention any of the illegal activities committed by some of Nixon's top aides, the destruction of evidence by the acting director of the FBI, etc., and at the same claims that reporters must have broken the law to obtain the information they got.  He portays the incident as a story with no substance that was that was blown out of proportion by the press and a Democratic congress, dimissing the entire affair as &quot;American juvenalia&quot;.  While historians should certainly include their own opinions in their writing, hiding or distorting the facts to support their opinions is simply dishonest.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who has not already obtained the facts of American history elsewhere.
B000002INJ|5.0|This was the defining moment in \\"Manowars\\" career! Everything comes together on this one. I really think they<BR>established their ultimate sound on \\"Kings of Metal\\". The<BR>production is excellent,and the songs are top of the line<BR>True Metal! This album was my first introduction to \\"Manowar\\"<BR>back in 1990 and man I tell you, I was immediately hooked!<BR>At first I was a little skeptical though, because it was'nt<BR>the typical metal sound I was used to hearing from the main-<BR>stream and what not, but after a few listens I began to see<BR>and feel the true message of \\"Manowars\\" music! Songs such as<BR>\\"Heart of Steel\\" and \\"Kingdome Come\\" have helped me through<BR>some of the darkest times of my life. No one carries emotion<BR>through their singing like Eric does!<BR>                               <br />     People can say the image and their lyrics are amusing,<BR>but they are obviously not getting the message! Maybe they<BR>are judging from a trendy state of mind! \\"Manowars\\" music<BR>is true, spiritual and very powerful! I could not ask for<BR>more. So if you're looking for true moving metal music and<BR>you're not caught up in the trendy music scene, buy this one!<BR>ONE of the BEST METAL ALBUMS of ALL TIME!!!!
B00005IC2H|5.0|I became aware of Sigur Ros through an article in The Economist last year. That article discussed details about the band: the lead singer playing guitar with a violin bow, the cult phenomenon within Iceland and Europe, the Icelandic/Hopelandic lyrics, and the band's influence on Radiohead.<br />While markedly different from Radiohead's Kid A/Amnesiac, they share a common tonal heritage. That said, Agaetis Byrjun seems the quiet, introspective older brother to the slightly neurotic, highly anxious Kid A, with Amnesiac falling somewhere between.<br />Initially, Agaetis Byrjun sounds like a funeral dirge - it drags itself forward with lumbering steps. After repeated listenings, the depth and extra-dimensionality emerge, forming a lush soundscape, cold around its edges and warm at its core, like a warm fire on a cold night. The indecipherable lyrics only underscore the importance of the composition over its parts, with the vocals functioning only for the purpose of harmony. The listener is left to fill the void with any thoughts that the music brings about.<br />This music doesn't feel like it was created so much as discovered.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an excellent album well tempered and full through and through.  After several plays I still feel compelled to kick back and take another stroll through the meanderings of her piano and wonderful voice.  Check out first sessions. Can't wait to see jones PA
B00000ICD9|2.0|This film was visually stunning. The special effects in this movie are almost worth the price to rent the movie. However the visual effects seem to be the only redeeming aspects of this film. The first 20 minutes of the film start off good enough and elicit some sorrowful feelings, but after Robin Williams untimely death you are left with a extremely routine and trite movie. As mentioned in the amazon editor review, there is absolutely no chemistry between Williams and Annabella Sciorra which definately detracts from the film, and the flashback storyline falls flat. Additionally, the score to this film is used extensively to try to make you feel weepy, but for me it drove me further away from this film. Constently throughout this film I found myself looking around the room and thinking of other things just to stimulate my mind from going to sleep. So I guess the gist of what I have to say is that if you are in the mood to watch a movie in order to be visually stunned and you find yourself crying because those allstate commercials are just so emotionally compelling perhaps this movie would be good for you. For me however, it just wasn't there.
B000056K04|3.0|Although there are a couple of songs on this cd that I like (Mother Father and Dreams Of Our Fathers), it is not in my opinion the best work done by DMB. When I hear &quot;Everyday&quot;, I am quickly reminded of the Dead's &quot;Shakedown Street&quot;  Although not painful to listen to, definitely not the band's best work. Ok, but not great. Catchy. Radio friendly.
B00000AFGM|3.0|I admit that I gotthis CD due to the hits &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Dope Show&quot; but other than that this CD doesn't have much to offer. All of the other Manson CDs (with the exception of Smells Like Children) were so heavy and so awesome...but this cd is alot more Glam Rock then Heavy Metal. This CD is great, it has awesome lyrics (the best part) awesome beats and awesome cover work, but this cd isn't as heavy as the others. This is just sort of the odd one out.<BR>         Somepeople like this CD and i have nthing against them I just think that this CD isn't like Marilyn, but the others make it up!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I doubt I need to add my two cents into the mix, but I have to say that &quot;Let Down&quot; is one of the most stunningly beautiful songs I've ever heard; it's in my all-time top ten. There's a sonic richness to it, a layering of instruments and Thom Yorke's incredible, haunting voice that gives me chills every time I listen to it (and believe me, I've listened to it a lot). Five minutes of perfection. And the rest of the album ain't bad either. (&quot;Electioneering,&quot; &quot;No Surprises,&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot; are the ones I return to the most, but I can't name one song on the album that I don't enjoy.) Anyway, &quot;Let Down&quot; is worth the price of the whole album. Absolutely genius.
B000003BF1|1.0|This is the first record I ever bought, and it is one of my favorites.  Part of what makes the record so great (and the CD awful) is the order in which the songs appear.  This CD seems to be some second rate re-issue.  The songs do not appear on the CD in the order they do on the original record or in the order that amazon lists them in their description.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I must say, this is definitely NOT what I expected from No Doubt. Their past two major releases were stunning, and this one more than lives up to the others. Lyrically, it's fantastic. Gwen and the boys have matured a great deal since Return of Saturn. Artistically - wow. After being together for so long, No Doubt continues to keep their sound fresh. They could've played it save by sticking to what they knew, but they took a huge risk by incorporating a reggae influenced sound. \\"Hey Baby\\" sounds exactly lik the No Doubt we know and love, but the rest of the album is fresh, new and fun.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is one of the greatest films of all time.  The swordplay, horseback riding, and archery put all other Robin Hoods to shame, and the vivid color and fantastic costumes make this a film to remember.<br />...
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As a big fan of Baz Luhrman, I had high hopes for this movie and hoped it would live up to the standard he set in &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; but he set a new standard.  Though the first twenty minutes of the movie are a little fact-paced, it's a great movie.  The casting was excellent (I was amazed at the vocal talents of both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman), the song choice was amazing (the soundtrack has everything from Madonna to David Bowie to Fatboy Slim), the story was moving, and the scenery was beautiful.  What more can you ask for in a movie?
0375507507|4.0|...Literarily, emotionally and psychologically. In terms of writing style Alexandra Fuller utilizes a visually descriptive, almost lyrical prose - \\"in the hot, slow time of day when time and sun and thought slow to a dragging, shallow, pale crawl...\\"  She mixes this technique with creative, childlike-simple unique  expressions such as when she describes two visiting church missionaries fending off her overly friendly dogs \\"in an offhand, I'm-not-really-pushing-your-dog-off-my-lap-I-love-dogs-really way.\\" On the emotional level this book is raw with the author sparing no punches in depicting her parents off-the-scale less than politically correct views of their fellow (but black) Zimbabweans. Her father fought on the losing (and wrong) side of the Rhodesian civil war. He was a supporter of Ian Smith's white-minority government. Indeed there's really not much to like about Fuller's parents. But this is besides the point and discussing DON'T LETS GO TO THE DOGS TONIGHT in terms of its  social, political and economic setting also misses the point entirely.<br />This is a memoir and as such it doesn't need a perspective or agenda nor does it have to pay attention to it's environment or worry about whatever cultural influences may be influencing the writer. All it needs to be, and to do, is to be well written and to be honest and open. This it does, and does well. There is plenty of opportunity to talk about politics and economics here. Afterall the time period (1972 -1990) and the places, Rhodesia (Zimbabwe after independence in 1980), Malawi and Zambia are frought with colonial and postcolonial concerns such as underdevelopment, equity, minority and majority rule, and revolutions. To complain that these issues are missing (and thankfully they are) is, again, missing the point. <br />Yes, Fuller's book does remind one of old colonial English literature in terms of its approach to Africa and Africans. It's not the romantic image that Dinisen, Markham, and Huxley portrayedthough. Some may see similarities with Waugh in the less than flattering portrayal of the people, and the visual imagery the word 'native' creates. But let's not stop there. What about those other defenders of the imperial imperative - Kipling, Conrad and Naipaul? If you wished to pursue this line of reasoning to see what all these writers' works say about culture,  race, colonialism and imperialism there's no better book to read than Edward Said's CULTURE & IMPERIALISM. As the doyen of postcolonial studies he knows all about the literary depiction of these dark deeds in Waugh's satire, Kipling's poetry and Naipaul's novels. The truth is Fuller's book is nowhere near this league, nor is it trying to be. For the last time...it's a memoir! <br />The words below are from another postcolonial thinker like Edward Said but offer the best context in which to view Fuller's and all other seemingly insensitive and contentious books. <br />\\"A book is a version of the world. If you do not like it, ignore it; or offer your own version in return.\\" (Salman Rushdie)
067144901X|5.0|My daughter knew this book by heart by the time she was 15 months old because we had to read it many times a day!  It is a really great book.  We have all of Boynton's book in our house!
B00005NVT1|4.0|Good stuff. Classics from Homework, remixed and blended together along with some good new stuff. Buy it if you are a dance fan.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The previews for this movie were very enticing, so I went to see it in the theaters with my friends last summer with high hopes.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Kudos to those who wrote this movie for disgracing an important period in history by making this movie into a tawdry romance.  I was expecting a movie about the WAR, not a twisted love story with a [bad] ending.  Most of the people in my school who were raving about it cared nothing about the history; they only saw it because they had a thing for either Ben Affleck or Josh Hartnett.  If you want to see a real movie, get \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\"
B00004XQ83|5.0|I think many, many people almost fell out of their seats at the 2002 Grammy Awards when 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' won the Grammy for Album of the Year.  When you think about it, it never should have happened.  The disc received almost no radio airplay.  Country stations wouldn't touch it.  The disc (and the film) gained a following mainly through word-of-mouth.  So what makes this collection of country-folk-bluegrass music so popular as we begin the 21st Century?  <br />I believe that audiences (especially those 30 years of age and older) are tired of the trend of mostly mindless electronic music that either has no originality or recycled songs from the past.  As our lives and society have become more complex, we need something to counterbalance that complexity, something to carry us back to times and ideas that are more simple.  There is nothing musically or lyrically complex about the songs here.  They have very simple structure musically and can be easily understood.  But the songs also (many of them) appeal to spiritual matters.  You won't hear spiritual themes in music played on most radio stations.  \\"Down to the River to Pray,\\" \\"I'll Fly Away,\\" \\"O Death,\\" \\"Angel Band,\\" and many others deal with spiritual issues that, let's face it, we all have thought about or will think about.  Our country gets almost no spiritual nourishment from any entertainment medium:  television, film, novels, theatre, or popular music.  I think people, whether they realize it or not, are drawn to this type of music and make a connection with it.  I don't think it's too much to say that the recognition this disc has received is a major turning point in popular music.  Who knows where it will go from here?  <br />As music goes, the 'O Brother' soundtrack is the front door of a mansion with many rooms.  So many styles are represented here:  folk, spirituals, work songs, country, bluegrass.  The disc should be looked upon as a starting point for a universe American roots music that is vast and amazing.  Take the plunge and enjoy.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Though this is not a great film in the same league of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", it is a very fine film none the less. Having served in the Infantry, I could related with everything and everyone in this film. This film pays tribute to those who served and fought on both sides of this battle. It also pays tribute to the wives and family left behind in the states. Every day for them was one of fear and uncertaintly also. The acting is first rate with Sam Elliott standing out in, what I feel, is the role of his career as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley.  The combat sequences are breathtaking in their portrayal of the death and carnage that took place at X-Ray. A highly recommended film for anyone who is a student of history,  for this is a story of bravery and devotion to duty and country that is rarely attempted in film today. I will go and see this film again.
B000059MEK|5.0|Now I admit, before I heard &quot;One More Time&quot; on the UK MTV I had no idea who the band even was. I wasn't there for &quot;Da Funk&quot; or &quot;Around the World.&quot; The first few times I heard the song, I didn't like it. Then I got to thinking , &quot;Wow this is actually pretty good.&quot; Still, I would not have bought the CD. Then a few weeks later I heard &quot;Aerodynamic&quot;! WOW! That song blew me away! It surprised me that I could love a song with no words so much. I bought the CD and loved it! (&quot;High Life&quot; is my personal fave!)<BR>Definetly worth it if you are a music fan. &quot;Discovery&quot; has opened my eyes to everything from Classical to House. By the way, definetly get &quot;Alive 1997&quot; and &quot;Homework.&quot;
B00003CXE7|4.0|It begins with this massive battle.  The special effects are spectacular, the cinematagrophy is outstanding and for those who enjoy blood and guts you get that too.  It sets up the character of General Maximus very well. All of the events after lead to a big good guys vs. bad guys battle at the end.  That all deflates in the coliseum of Rome.  The whole movie looks and sounds excellent on DVD and the extras are great.
B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx first exploded onto the music scene in 1987 with his self titled debut album. The album went top 10 and spawned four top ten singles, &quot;Hold Onto The Nights&quot;, &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot;, &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;, and &quot;Should've Known Better&quot;. They are all here on this collection. The next several years saw many more hits come his way. The biggest ones being &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;, &quot;Angelia&quot;, &quot;Hazard&quot;, and &quot;Now And Forever&quot;. All right here. There were a few others as well. This CD also includes a song called &quot;Angel's Lullabye&quot;, which just might be the nicest song Marx has ever done. A gorgeous ballad. Richard Marx is an incredibly underrated writer/producer/composer/musician. He is cursed with being remembered by so many people as an &quot; 80's teen pop&quot; kind of guy. Maybe he was. So what?. The 90's saw a complete change in him. His last 3 albums have showed such incredible growth and maturity. This is NOT the same Richard Marx we knew in the 80's. His lyrics are meaningful and as tight as they come. His composing talents are incredible. But yet, the respect and credibility that he so deserves still eludes him. The last few years has seen Richard working with such artists as N' Sync, Barbara Streisand, and others. Marx will probably never reach the huge status he once had, but continuing to make solid albums as he has, he still wins. If only more people would come to see that, then everything would be perfect. Buy this CD.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures should be the album on which all other rock albums should be judged.  I have been listening to this album for 14 years and this is cream of the crop. This album is the epic of Rush's career and should be mandatory listening for musicians of all styles.  The combination of drums, guitar and base is faultless; you will never hear a bunch of songs so tightly nit than on this album. Moving pictures is truly a perfect album.<br />Tom Sawyer - Rock anthem of the 80's, everybody and their brother knows how good this song is, truly a classic. This catchy tune is Rush's most successful song and I can see why.  The bass is the most recognizable bass line ever, the guitars are catchy and the drums pounding riffs really get you in to the song. This is an all individualistic attitude song, great beginning for the album. (5 of 5 stars)<br />Red Barchetta - For a long time this was the least favorite song on the album for me, however this has changed.  The story behind the song is fantasy where all gas driven vehicles are outlawed and the larger safer air cars hunt them down for sport.  Of course our hero drives a gas powered Red Barchetta and gets chased down by the air cars, but he escapes and lives to enjoy his freedom another day. Musically this song is a classic and is my favorite driving son. (5 of 5 stars) <br />YYZ - An instrumental, the name was taken from the airport code for Toronto's International airport.   \\"YYZ\\" was on the baggage tags and thus that is what the song is named for. This is the best instrumental of all times; the bass line itself is probably the best line Geddy has ever done. Heck the bass line is the best that anybody anywhere has ever done. (5 of 5 stars)<br />Limelight - Another one of Rush's most recognizable songs: Limelight everybody knows this song, as well they should. Arguably one of Neil's best lyrical concoctions, I find myself singing along with Geddy all the time. Once again bass, guitar and drums combine for the perfect song. (5 of 5 stars)<br />The Camera Eye - Eleven minutes of  progressive music bliss, the bass, guitar and drum solo towards the end of the song is the best 45 seconds put on (insert your favorite recordable material here) This is my favorite Rush song of all times, I often see myself walking down the streets of London listening to this song.  I would like to write more about this song, but I just want to sit back and listen. (5 of 5 stars)<br />Witch Hunt - A very haunting and eye opening song, where people hunt down \\"witches\\" Witches in a sense meaning anything they don't understand and fear.  My favorite Neil lyric comes from this song:  <BR>\\"Quick to judge, quick to anger, slow to understand, ignorance and prejudice and fear walk hand in hand\\" The awesome drums and guitar make this one of the best songs on the album. (5 of 5 stars)<br />Vital Signs - Great bass line, heavy and pounding twangy guitars and lyrics.  Everybody got to deviate from the norm?  Does Neil mean in a good or bad way when he says this? Either way I still love the song.   (5 of 5 stars)<br />Musically, lyrically, fundamentally this is the best album I have ever heard bar none. Forget Zeppelin, KISS, Rolling Stones (I do admire and respect them all) this Rush album is incredible. If you're a new to Rush I strongly suggest you start with this album, it covers all the bases.  If you're a Rush fan you already have this album, if you're a music fan by this album now, you won't regret it.  <br />As with all my album reviews I listen to the album at least 5 times before I write a review, I fail to see how somebody can write a review only listening to it once.  I also write my thoughts about the individual songs while listening to them, making for a very real and very honest review.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Like all other war movies out there, this movie is great.If you enjoyed \\"Black Hawk Down\\", then you will love \\"We were Soldires\\".<BR>Just like \\"Black Hawk Down\\", there is lots of action, blood, gore, and entertaining scenes. Unlike \\"Black Hawk Down\\", this movie has character developments. Mel Gibson is a army colonel.Sam Elliott is his assistant.Chris Klein is a soldier, and Keri Russell is his pregnant wife. Greg Kinnear is a helicopter pilot, and Barry Pepper is a photojournalist who is in the middle of the battle.<br />While this movie is entertaining, it also has a great positive message.<br />If you want to go see a great war movie, with a great cast, go see \\"We Were Soldires\\", you wont be disapointed.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|i dont usually enjoy any album as i do this one. I wasnt a hendrix fan until i bought this and it opened up the door in a way. The better songs are crosstown traffic and manic deppression. Some of his greatest hits are just annoying though, like foxy lady and purple haze. the cd's cover is great, like on all of his albums, with facts and notes about each song. If you want to get&quot;experienced&quot; get this album
B00005R2M3|5.0|I know Shakira cense she started her album &quot;Piez Descalzos&quot;. Cense that time i started getting more into her. Shakiras albums are awesome. She sings very good and she has always try her best. Shakira has won what she deserves plus she deserves more grammys then ever. Now im a big fan of ShAkIrA. Shakira es una muchacha muy linda y alegre. It's amazing that shakira wrote this songs of her last album &quot;Laundry Service&quot;. She did very well and they are good songs. But the thing is best is that she did what she wanted to do.Shakira prometio darnos un album en ingles y lo cumplio. I think shakira sings better on spanish then english. Her spanish songs sound more nice. Con mas sentido y con mas ganas de todo. Se expresa mejor en espanol que en ingles. Eya ama. Theres much to say about her which i can't express my self. She's the best i hope she continues to be Num 1 always. I like Shakira alot and i feel proud of her.

B00005JKYS|5.0|Silence. Complete silence. As the film ended and the lights grew to a glow, the packed audience sat still and paid respectful homage as the fallen soldiers names appeared on the screen. Some around me could barely contain themselves as they shook and cried. Veterans and soldiers in military uniform humbly and quitly remained in their seats long after I left the room. It was amazing to see all of these strangers who had come together to see a movie, suddenly seem to be a part of something special and real. It reminded me of when I first saw Private Ryan a few years back, and saw the same reaction. People who had been arguing and behaving rudely before the movie, were now leaving proudly, holding the door open for the next person. It takes something special to do that. Like Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldier's comes at a time of heightened patriotism and valor. When life has a little more meaning, and when Americans dive deeper within themselves to find an extra emotion of strength to get through the day. What seperates We Were Soldiers from other great Vietnam films such as Platoon, was the effort to show both sides of the war. A Northern Vietnamese soldier, writing in his journal and staring at the photograph of his wife, as at the same time an American soldier is also dwelling on thought's of home. Before American's, The North Vietnamese army had fought the Chinese, and French. The opening sequence is a massacre ten years prior to the Vietnam conflict involving the French. It establishes what the American's would have to face later. As the American soldier's begin to fall, telegram's arrive back on base notifying their wives of their death. The band that the women formed was also inspiring, and how unbelievably strong they must have been. Leaving the theater, I told myself never to forget We Were Soldier's, nor the sacrifice our men, like my own uncle. After watching the world seem to fall apart last year, it's good to remember that even at this moment our men are serving their country every day. Close friend's, and family. Sacrifice's were made in Vietnam for a reason that we are still searching for. If any of our brother veteran's happens to read this simple review, take a higher meaning and the most gracious thought's when I say thank you. They were Soldier's once, and Young. Their youth was lost in the valley's of war, and we owe it to them.
0767802519|5.0|This is an action packed, fast, furious action movie that will leave you wanting more.  This is the first American movie by Luc Besson that stars Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman and they all give award winning performances.  The story is about a French hit man, brilliantly paid by Jean Reno (Ronin, Mission Impossible, French Kiss) who moves without a sound, kills without emotion and disappears without a glimmer who ends up taking care of a little girl played by Natalie Portman.  Natalies character Matildas family is killed by a corrupt DEA cop played incredibly by Gary Oldman.  Gary plays the role so well; it makes you wonder about him.  All kidding aside, Gary Oldman is an incredible actor and this movie proves it.<br />The story of the movie revolves around Matilda wanting to get revenge on the killer of her younger brother, the corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman) and the interesting relationship forming between Leon (Jean Reno) and Matilda (Natalie Portman).  This is not your atypical action movie  Luc Besson does a great job where you will be laughing one minute and cheering on the anti-hero Leon as hes blowing away some drug dealers.  Overall a great movie and a must for any action movie aficionado.<br />I have the American version of the DVD and not the original uncut international version.
6305127697|2.0|Perhaps I am just too stupid to 'get' it. Maybe I missed something. I failed to see much merit in this film.<br />The story is simply sensationalistic, involving pornography, multiple-personality disorders (of the Hollywood variety) and mutilation, but all with no discernable point other than to thrill. The characters are flat, the romantic subplot seems disjointed and only quite arbitrarily related to the rest of the plot, and everything seems to be sorely lacking in invention and meaning.<br />Edward Norton does turn in a good performance, but should have saved his acting talents for something worthier.
B00004XPPE|4.0|Enjoyed the movie as much as when I first saw it in the 70s.<BR>I only encountered two problems:<br />1) Original film quality<BR>A digital restoration of the original film print is in order, I noticed a lot of graininess and flecks in the image.<br />2) Larry Hagman seems to be slightly confused with Gene Hackman in the filmography under 'special features'.<BR>For example, Larry Hagman is credited with an appearance in the 1978 Superman movie.  Lex Luthor was played by Gene Hackman.<br />Gaffes like these should be checked before shipping.<br />...
B00005QDW1|5.0|I own all 5 of No Doubt's albums, and this is just another masterpiece! It may not have songs as deep as &quot;don't speak&quot; or &quot;simple kind of life&quot;, but it does have a lot of upbeat, positive party songs, and a few meaningful lyrics here and there. I'm glad that No Doubt tried something new (and it worked). If every album sounded the same, people would get bored of them. So you should definitely check out this album, it's worth every single penny!
0790736233|1.0|Contact must be the worst movie ever made.  I couldn't have finished it if not for the beautiful Jodie Foster.  It's about listening for contacts from outer space.  Foster's efforts are financed by an impossibly weathy person who must have been cracked.  Billions of dollars are wasted on an impossible scheme.  I thought I would throw up.
B000001GPX|5.0|Beethoven's masterpieces have been interpreted by many great conductors and even greater orchestras. Carlos Kleiber ahead of the Vienna Philharmonic has set a new, outstanding and quite rare opportunity to enjoy the 5th outside the Karajan/Metha and other major conductors' circle.<BR>It reminds me of Berstein's performance of the equally acclaimed Requiem of Mozart.<BR>The digital remastering did a perfect job for a 1975 recording. For sure, a collector's item I am proud to have add to my list.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I didn't see this movie when it was in the theaters, and I hate that I didn't see it sooner!<br />This semi-autobiographical movie follows 15 year old William Miller as he experiences the behind the scenes happenings of an up-and-coming rock band, Stillwater.  In the beginning, you meet his overbearing but well meaning mother, who surprisingly enough allows him to tour with Stillwater.  Frances McDormand steals several sceens with her wonderful acting.  Miller meets his favorite rock critic, Lester Bangs, and Bangs has Miller writing for Bangs's magazine, Creem.  The next thing Miller knows, Rolling Stone wants him to write for them!  That's how Miller ends up on the road with Stillwater and the wonderful Penny Lane (Kate Hudson).  <br />This movie is multi-faceted, has well developed characters and never gets bogged down in useless drivel.  I own both the VHS and DVD versions, and the DVD is definitely the one to own.  The uncut version is better than the original, and the extra material fills in a few very small gaps in the movie.  Also, with the DVD, you get both versions anyway.  <br />Plus, the music!  The best sceen in the whole movie is when the entire bus breaks out in Elton John's &quot;Tiny Dancer.&quot;  I wish the movie had done better so that they would have released a volume II of songs.  The music is great, and if you like the movie, pick up the soundtrack as well.
630516603X|5.0|\\"Feet of Flames\\" truly is the best dance show ever done! Michael Flatley sure knows how to do it right...the music, sets, costumes, lights...and of course the dancing. His talent and artistic sense shine through every moment. Everything is superb...an immense feast for the senses!<br />The best thing with the DVD version is that it includes a 60-minute (or so) &quot;making of&quot; feature with interviews and extra footage of the show!  Also included is a biography detailing Michael Flatley's career.<br />If you are deciding on whether to buy Feet of Flames or Lord of the Dance, you'd probably want to choose this one instead.  Feet of Flames is basically the same as Lord of the Dance in the sense of storyline, however there are additional dances, a special flute solo performed my Michael Flatley himself, different &amp; better costuming and the camera work is a whole lot better! The one thing I did not like about Lord of the Dance was the bad editing/camera work.  The scenes cut away much too quickly. I owe both LOTD and FOF and I've found it more enjoyable to watch FOF purely for this reason. With Feet of Flames you get lots of different angles and extended views. Overall it's a much better put-together show. <br />If you're looking for traditional Irish dance, this shouldn't disappoint you either.  Sure, it has modernized the idea of traditional dance and it is a couple of steps up from Riverdance but that's what makes it fun! It's so modern and exciting yet it still gives you that feel of deep-rooted Irish tradition.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I was very excited to finally rent this movie.  I had wanted to see it in the theater, but it wasn't a movie my husband was interested in watching.  I should have followed his instincts.<br />I just finished watching this movie, and I can sum up my feelings in one word- ugh.  After the first 13 minutes, I almost turned it off, but I managed to hang through until the end.  I had a hard time putting some of the names with the characters- I still can't tell you what the owner's name was.  That led to confusion when I kept hearing names but didn't know how to link them up with anyone.  I also didn't like the number of fantasy scenes- I don't mind the ocassional &quot;daydream&quot; type sequence, but an elephant house in front of the Moulin Rouge that the dancers use to entice their men?  It was just too much for me.  Additionally, I didn't like that you know what happens to Satine as soon as the movie starts.  A little mystery can be nice.<br />All my feelings aside, I did like the costumes.  Visually, the movie was beautiful, and that's where the 2 stars come from.  I also liked how modern music was worked into the film.  There are also some parts which are funny and cute, like the scene in the elephant where the gang improvises a number in order to sell the Duke on the idea of Spectacular Spectacular.  Also, Nicole Kidman is a surprisingly good singer- she does her own lyrics in the movie's numerous vocal events.<br />I like movies that go out on the edge, but I guess I'm just not artsy enough to like this one.
B000001EPB|5.0|Everything is just perfect about this cd except for one thing: only 2 of the tracks at the end have the taps included!!  Like many other Amazon.com customers reviewing this cd, I wish that there was more tapping included.  However, this doesn't change the fact that the music is absolutely phenomenal on its own.  It really is an essence of artistic beauty.  A must have for Irish music fans or if you own the LOTD VHS or DVD.
0800179501|2.0|Great movie. However the dvd transfer is poorly done. Only has dolby surround. And only available in fullscreen. I hope Columbia Pictures releases a dts widescreen version of this great movie.

B000002ADT|5.0|This is the coolest, most laid back group of songs and an essential CD for anyone who likes jazz. This is the CD I would give a friend who said &quot;What is jazz?&quot; Virtually unrehearsed featuring at least 3 jazz icons....Evans, Davis, and Coltrane, it defines jazz with its bluesy sound. You must have this one!
B00005LC1H|5.0|We owned these episodes on VHS for years...now I bought them as a birthday gift for my brother in DVD format.  What a difference! The picture and sound quality have really improved and there are so many extras on the DVD: interviews, trailers, bloopers, biographies, etc.<br />Fawlty Towers is great, classic comedy at its finest!  Fun for the whole family and it has definite re-watch ability! The only bad part is that they didn't make more!
0471381985|5.0|Ben Graham may have done for investing what Euclid did for geometry, but the Graham student must take a long and winding road to collect and organize Grahamian \\"theorems.\\"  Greenwald modernizes and thoughtfully organizes the value framework originally expounded by Graham, and shows how investors might take -and in the final section of the book, how several master investors DO take- Graham's notion of buying dollar bills for fifty cents and apply this central idea in creative ways to some of the less frequented areas of the market.  <br />Greenwald et.al. show a terrific aptitude for remaining informal and conversational while maintaining brevity and orderliness.  Neophytes are unlikely to encounter a clearer, more concise explanation of `discounting future cash flows', and most students of value investing will be well-served by Greenwald's order of equity valuation: (1) Asset Value, (2) Earnings Power, (3) Growth, all of which are clearly explained.  Additionally, Greenwald discusses a useful addition to common metrics such as `net asset value' and `liquidation value' with the concept of `replacement cost'.  Greenwald also acknowledges and thoughtfully attempts to quantify the value investor's less traditionally acknowledged principle of `franchise value', which he judiciously attributes to Warren Buffett as the latter's singular contribution to investment analysis.<br />The book's admirable brevity is also its primary shortcoming.  Whereas Graham included senior debt and convertible debt vehicles both in Security Analysis and in his investment practices, this text is for all practical purposes only an examination of equities.  If the authors of \\"Value Investing\\" ever opt to write about a value approach to bonds and other instruments, I'll bet they'd have a captive audience.
B00005Y228|5.0|I remember Kylie from the late 80's when I was still in elementary school.  Her CD caught my eye this week and I ended up buying it.  I'll tell you right now, this is not the same Kylie from 1988!  I think the entire album is terrific, although I'm not a huge fan of this type of music.  I really enjoyed listening to this CD and I'm really glad she's mounting a comeback!  Favorite tracks: Can't Get You Out of My Head; Fever; In Your Eyes; dancefloor; and the bonus track, Butterfly.

B00005QW5X|5.0|hedwig and the angry inch was one of 2001's biggest surprises. not since rocky horror, tommy, or pink floyd has a rock musical been this addictive. every song here is catchy, some touching, and others downright beautiful. while hedwig is nowhere near as depressing as pink floyd or tommy, it also doesn't come across as campy as rocky horror. hedwig tells the story of a man originally from berlin and his misfortunate botched sex change who dreams of becoming a great rock star while in america. this magnificent musical gives us insight into destined love, hope, and the dreams which we all dream. i'm just so disappointed as the oscars have overlooked another great performance. john cameron mitchell deserves atleast one nomination !!!!
B00005LLK8|4.0|Very good movie. Its strongest point is the fact that, even talking about a touching and beautiful history, is is not overly melodramatic or cliched. Very good British movie!!
0887307396|4.0|Having spent the last four years of our lives being taught to think about every business problem in a particular way, it was great to read a business book that encourages you to \\"think outside of the box.\\"  We have read many textbooks in our time at University, and it was refreshing to read a book that expressed clear and simple ideas that we will remember after we graduate. \\"Built To Last\\" started off strong by `shattering' the 12 well-known \\"myths\\" that they teach us in school. The book then continued with the author's model that is based around the premise of preserving the core ideology, and stimulating progress within the organization; it uses simple points that build on one another to create a first-rate framework. The authors make their points at the beginning of each chapter and then build on them with numerous examples of `visionary' companies...Some of our favorite points were:<BR>- The true definition of a core ideology; including the distinction between a core purpose and core values;<BR>- Encourage trying lots of stuff and keeping what works; <BR>- And, \\"The Genius of the And\\"...it is possible to have two things at once.<BR>Although, this book was primarily targeted towards entrepreneurs and CEO's, we found that we could use this book for our future career search and within our daily lives.  For example, the chapter titled Cults and Cultures outlined the extraordinary commitment employees have to their particular organization; Personally, we don't think we have what it takes to be a true \\"Nordie,\\" but it gave us insight into what characteristics and traits to be looking for in an organization we would like to work for.  <BR>Some of the inferior traits of the book are that there were some parts in the novel where the authors seem to stretch their examples to fit within their framework, and they came across as being slightly bias to their own theories.  We also found that they never mention the same company in every chapter, which made it harder to followand also harder to believe that every visionary company fit all aspects of their model.  However, overall, this book is an easy read, with a simple model that makes sense.  It uses interesting companies and is backed up by 6 years of intense research.  We recommend this book to any student who is looking to think on different terms than what we are being taught in school.
B000021XS0|3.0|Oh, Lord, it's really difficult to review a DT album!!! SPecially this one, considered by almost everybody to be their perfect conceptual master piece.<BR>And it is... at some points. I think the flaw in the album is the following: <BR>DT, even being true heroes by managing to hold a deal with a major label without selling out, seem to be trapped inside their formula of displaying their unbeliavable technical mastery to their fans, and it seems SCENES had to show how good they are, ONCE AGAIN! There's no need for that!!! each of us knows how Portnoy can attack his drums, how fast Petrucci is, how boring are Labrie vocals. THe guys in DT play better than most of mankind would ever dream of, even if each of us practised 10 hours / day from now on!! But they don't need to try to show us that at every single note!!<br />I also found there was no need to try to write such \\"intricate\\" or \\"complicated\\" lyrics for such a simple plot...<br />Anyway, I think this is one of their best albums, but that will bring no new fans for them: the bunch that like them, will say: GREAT AS EVER; the bunch that doesn't  will say: ROBOTIC AND COLD AS EVER.

1572522232|5.0|Narration from Suspiria:  \\"Suzy Banyon decided to perfect her ballet studies at the most famous school for dancing in Europe.  She chose the celebrated Tamm Academy of Freiborg.  One day, at nine in the morning, she left Kennedy Airport, New York, and arrived in Germany at 10:40 PM, local time.\\"<br />So begins a journey that the American girl would never have anticipated in her wildest dreams.  A student, Patty Newman, is seen leaving the in the pouring rain scared...  That is nothing compared to the gruesome manner of her death at her girlfriend's flat.  It ends with the painted ceiling glass bulging out and shattering towards the foyer, followed by Patty's garrotted, bloody body crashing downward from a worm's eye view.  Exquisite!  Bulging is also used in Inferno when the body of Mark's fellow student crashes down in front of him.<br />Suzy is the only likeable character here.  She is pretty, shy, humble, but most important of all, she is intelligent and intuitive, which helps her during her stay.  And Jessica Harper makes her a credible unique person the viewer roots for.<br />Alida Valli is also effective as the forbidding Miss Tanner, a typical supervisor-type Guardian.  1940's star Joan Bennett (Madame Blanc) is a more tempered Guardian, but nevertheless gives the presence that she is in charge.  I don't know who plays the fat piggy-eyed servant.  The character, who plays a semi-important role here, seems to have been raised on ugly pills all her life.<br />This movie if anything, is representative of Dario Argento's wild use of lights.  Red and blue are the key colours here.  The exterior of the academy is red, as are the carpeted panels in the hallways.  My favorite use of red is when the girls are in the practice hall, converted to a makeshift dormitory.  The hall is bathed in a hellish red glare.  The shape of the directress behind Suzy and Sarah is nothing compared to the guttural, asthmatic snores emanating from that mysterious personage.  Creepy with a capital creep!  Red is also the colour of blood, and there is a lot of that here, as well as the wine Suzy has to drink during her restricted diet.<br />Blue light is seen when Ms. Tanner marches up the attic to find out where the maggots are coming from.  The creatures fall down through ceiling cracks and into dorm rooms, causing mass hysteria among the girls.  Suzy freaks out, but that's nothing compared to the reaction of the other girls.  Pandemonium, to say the least.  The way Argento stages their emergence is unexpected and gradual.<br />And Goblin's wild and weird score of screams, insanely pounding drums, guitars, echoing hisses of \\"witch\\" and of course sighs (Suspiria is Italian for sigh) might as well mirror Argento's perverse mind.<br />Suspiria is more a triumph of design and suspense rather than logic (e.g. why kill Daniel the pianist?), and it's important to remember that in order to enjoy this stunning film.  American and British horror have nothing on this masterpiece!capital creep!

B00003CXMG|5.0|THis kind of movie is another proof that the American movie industry can produce gems once ina while, instead of only putting out lame pop-corn productions with no substance at all!! THe movie is marvellous, touching, redempting. The only sin is the cover of the DVD, which portrays only Kate Hudson!!! She is not the main character!!! THe boy William and guitarrist Russel Hammond are!! Well, go figure.. maybe Crowe had to make some commercial concession...THis is a fine movie.
B000002UAU|5.0|Thirty-five years after its momentous June 1967 release, no one has been able to give THE definitive interpretation on what has been declared as the greatest album of all time.  It should stay that way, as it takes away the mystery of life.  And with a universally recognizable album cover, it's definitely a period piece and shows which personages made personal impact on the Beatles: Monroe, Brando, Mae West, Laurel and Hardy, Lenny Bruce, Oscar Wilde, W.C. Fields, Aleister Crowley, Sir Robert Peel, and even a former Beatle, Stuart Sutcliffe.  Gandhi would've been a welcome presence had it not been for EMI's concern of offending India.  Universal is the key to making monumental albums, of which Sgt Peppers is of the highest calibre.  It's in my personal Top Five.<br />Paul's sterling vocals are at their best in the rollicking title track.  Ringo's sole vocal is on \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" transcends universally, especially with \\"What would you say if I sang out of tune/Would you stand up and walk out on me?\\"  The answer would be \\"no\\" during the Summer of Love.  What about in today's conformist climate?  With its advocacy of love at first sight, it is a truly romantic tune.<br />With the descriptive psychedelic imagery in \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds,\\" small wonder people thought that it was a code for LSD.  As it was, it was taken from a picture drawing by young Julian Lennon.<br />\\"Getting Better\\" is an inspiring tune if people take it to heart.  Who hasn't been kept down by parents or high school teachers?  With the new scene and a woman, things have to be \\"getting better all the time,\\" right?<br />\\"Fixing A Hole\\" to \\"keep one's mind from wandering\\" seems a bit contradictory in this neo-Enlightenment period, for the purpose was to expand one's mind.  But then I remembered that it was for \\"where the rain gets in,\\" i.e. negative thoughts or shallow, unfulfilling people and ideas.  And it is disturbing that those same people don't seem to realize \\"why they can't get past my door.\\"  That makes sense.  Of course, it's OK for your mind to wander if it's going to the room that's been painted \\"in a colourful way.\\"<br />The opening harp and the string section entwines \\"She's Leaving Home\\" with a lover's touch.  Like the previous two songs, self discovery was key to young people in the 1960's.<br />The circumstances behind \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite,\\" taken from a 1843 circus poster of John Lennon's is just one of those unique, serendipitous events that couldn't work for any other group.  The hurdy-gurdy-like special effects that take place after \\"Henry the horse dances the waltz.\\"  I wonder how many Generation Y-ers, who take special sounds for granted in today's music, have any appreciation of what George Martin, their producer, had to do in order to get the audio trickery and fantastic sounds that permeate through this song and others.<br />\\"Within You Without You,\\" with George's ethereal vocals, sitars and tablas, is a wonderful addition to the album, and it shows how spiritually ahead George was compared to the other Beatles.<br />The simplistic, totally disarming, and charming \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\" with its clarinet, is a sharp contrast to the complex instrumentation of the other songs.  Another universal tune, and one that doesn't need deep mental digging.<br />\\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" benefits from having the overdubbed brass section and a sterling guitar solo by John in the middle of the song.  The animal sounds make for a bizarre ending, but I think I heard a chicken, cat, dog, horse, lion, elephant.<br />I don't know how to explain the effect \\"A Day In The Life\\" has on me.  There are the two verses of the man who blew his mind out in a car and the film of the English army winning the war, the swirling strings simulating a trip, the bouncing piano that leads to the third stanza, another swirling trip, and then that piano chord crashing with its awesome finality.

0060506989|5.0|I won't go into a lengthy description about this book as I see that has previously been wonderfully done, but I would like to say that as a person who watched a boyfriend go off to die in Vietnam, who has never understood the way our Vietnam vets were so terribly treated, nor why they cannot be recognized for the heroes they are, hopefully this book will bring this war more into the forefront. So much damage was done to our young soldiers during this war, so many came home not only physically damaged but mentally as well. We need to understand what they faced, what they went thru, and how they survived. Bravo, Mr. Moore and Mr. Galloway, and thank you!
B00004XQP4|5.0|This album is awsome, it has showed that it is possible for a band to grow up. It was suprising to hear the songs like &quot;Misery&quot; or &quot;Hold on&quot; on a Green Day record, but these songs have become 2 of my favorite songs. The CD is great, though different.<BR>                    -Jake
B00005JKYS|4.0|Based on the true story of the first major battle of the Vietnam War. On November 14, 1965, in the Ia Drang Valley of Vietnam, Lt. Colonel Harold Moore (Mel Gibson) and more than 400 troopers from the U.S. 7th Air Cavalry find themselves surrounded by 2000 enemy soldiers. The film tells a tale of men outnumbered and besieged, and their moving acts of loyalty toward one another.
B00003CY5J|3.0|The score opens with De Niro's character cracking a safe (and needing reading glasses to do it) and being discovered by a young woman. Obviously shaken, he tells his fence Max(Marlon Brando, for what he probably cost the producers could've hired 100 of me and been just as well off) that he's quitting (his girlfiriend Angela Bassett wants him out too).Max wants him to do one more job a cocky new guy (Edward Norton)has come up with.<BR>DeNiro's character isn't interested and says so, then tries to have Norton beaten up for pestering him. That doesn't work , he finally reluctantly agrees to the job on the condition that he runs every aspect. I thought that things developed pretty well through the story, even the small details looked very convincing to me. I liked the look of the theft itself, DeNiro being set up by Norton, the look on Norton's face when he realizes that the &quot;old&quot; guy he hated for telling him to be patient has in fact outfoxed HIM. I can't condone thievery, but it was well presented here, I'm not sure what I'd change  but mostly a good movie.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This movie has a good action scene later in the movie, hence the two stars. But other than that, this is an over-glorified wash-up with too many cliches and too much patriotism. Throughout the film we are constantly given the image of the Japanese being completely evil and if you don't feel that in the middle of the viewing, you certainly will when it comes to the voice-over at the end. <br />The love triangle is just something that should have never been implemented in the first place. Half the time this doesn't even feel like a war movie. Instead it gives off the impression of some sort of bad TV Sitcome hoping to attain cheap thrills. And some of the humor is just downright childish. If this film was hoping to gain respect for it's dramatic story-telling, it has gone nowhere close to it's target.<br />The characters are just too cliched. Two cocky ace pilots, one beautiful lady and a whole bunch of sterotyped buddies. Cuba Gooding, while I do consider him a great actor, has no real purpose in the movie at all. He has no memorable lines at all, and really doesn't have an effect on the other characters at all. I have a feeling that the people behind this movie simply felt that casting Cuba would guarantee this film becoming gold.<br />You will overall be better off with Saving Private Ryan. This film is nothing more than a movie you would watch with your girlfriend, and that in itself is a disgrace. And let me close out with this word: Hiroshima. Let's investigate whether or not the Japanese were really that evil.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Nevermind the hype, here's The Strokes. While the band isn't pioneering anything musically groundbreaking with IS THIS IT what they do exceptionally well is write insanely catchy 3 minute pop/rock tunes. Nerarly every song is brimming with a restless driving energy. Vocalist Julian Casablanas is not the most talented singer you'll likely come across, and his use of vocal distortion effects on nearly every song can grow a bit tedious, but his monochromatic singing dosen't take away the catchy hooks and melodies of the songs. The 12 tracks that make up this 35 minute debut are just enough material without outstaying its welcome, which says more than other bands who fill twice as much music on their CDs without even being half as good.
068484267X|5.0|While the situation that Frank McCourt grew up in is nothing to laugh about, he somehow makes you laugh.  By looking at poverty through a child's eyes one cannot help but laugh at the stories he tells.  The way he viewed the church and religion.  The movie does not do justice to the book at all.  It lost all the humor the book exuded.  Read it and laugh at what a child thinks of the world and the adults around him.
B00004TRD8|4.0|The first Terminator film was very low budget, but ultimately succeeded in terms of a fantastic storyline and a menacing villain[Arnold as the terminator]wich led to its immense box office success. Everybody suspected a sequel, and so it came, in the form of Terminator 2:Judgement Day, a bigger, better, more action packed sequel.<BR> John Connor has now been born and is now about 13 years old. Now he is the target for the brand new T-1000, a liquid metal killing machine whose mission is to destroy him and ultimately ending the future of the machines in which he is the leader.<BR>But like in the first film, the future resistance is able to send back a terminator aswell, but to protect young John.<BR> The good terminator[played by arnold] finds John first, and they both go on the run from the T-1000, in which Arnold is no match. Which follows is a sequence of events that keeps you on the edge of your seat with awsome special effects and some truly amazing stunts. Of course this is a James Cameron picture, no surprise. The maestro of big budget event films.<BR> This is an amazing action film which most people will love, and to boot it is an amzing DVD loaded with special features and some really slick menus.A must buy DVD movie in every respect.
0451524985|5.0|Lawrence really lays bare his soul in this book.  It is the story of a ripe, red blooded woman who needs a real man.  As usual there doesn't seem enough to go around.  Ladies!  I hope you all meet a Mellor's in your lives.  Gardening is indeed a great trade for aspiring lovers.  And You'll love this tale - it was one of Lawrence's best.<br />Lawrence wanted to bring us back to our dynamic center; he hated this celebral world and head sex.  His domain was the realm of the body ... And all of its pent up sexual dynamisms.  If you read Fantasia of The Unconscious you will be able to access his views right from his teeming intelect.  He was perhaps one of the finest writers Britain ever produced and his literary output was prodigious indeed!
079073639X|4.0|I have not met too many people who really like this movie, but I am one of them.  First of all, I have not read the book, and a movie is never as good as the book upon which it is based.  Having said that, I enjoyed the overall premise of the movie.  Some people have said the the the premise was a big letdown, but I think that if you stick with this movie, you will not be sorry.
0393312836|5.0|I don't wish to repeat other's already well-articulated praise on style and language and brilliance. The narrative flow and the story itself are confoundedly magnificent. Yes, I too love A Clockwork Orange.<br />Here is a story of free will versus society; a devastating critique onindividual human nature and an even harsher attack on the ultimately Fascist attitude of any organized system of justice.<br />In a mildly Science-Fiction-style plot we go forward to the parallel near future where politics have taken over ever aspect of human life. Even thoughts can be controlled and the punishment shall always fit the crime. We, the reader, are forced to choose sides between a violent, anarchist, sociopthic rapist-murder, and the oppressive State Government that will force the mind to suppress thoughts, to suppress all human desire in an effort to make certain that everyone will be safe in their homes, out-of-sight--<br />The arguments are beautifully placed and here, ten years after I've read it, the passion and power of the debate still lingers, fresh. (On a brief side-note in relation to Kubrick's wonderful film adaptation: I love Stanley Kubrick and A Clockwork Orange is, depending on my mood at the time, perhaps my favorite of his flicks; but the book diverges into even more decadent and intense realms, and forces one to actually experience the events in your mind, not transposed on a visual plate, and you experience the horror even more viscerally than the romanticized extravagence of the film)
B00004XQ83|5.0|The integration of music into movies began even before the talkies when piano players played a score to accompany the silent pictures that were shown on the screen. Since then, movie music has grown and evolved into an almost essential element in making a movie. In general, the music in a movie accompanies everything else that one sees on the screen. However, sometimes the music of a movie is the most memorable thing about the picture and sometimes the music in a picture considerably detracts from the action on the screen. However, the best films are usually accompanied by a great score and/or soundtrack that doesn't just accompany the screen action, but is an integral part of it.<br />Movie soundtracks don't get much better than the soundtrack to O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? This album is a wonderful collection of folk, bluegrass, country, and gospel songs that is a most integral part of the film. In fact, the Coen Brothers (with help from T Bone Burnett) had a musical blueprint made long before the movie was finished. The movie and the music are inseparably intertwined together.<br />This album is stock full of great songs. Some of my favorites include &quot;Down To The River To Pray&quot; sung by Alison Krauss; &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; sung by Harry McClintock; &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; sung by Norman Blake; &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; sung by Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch; and &quot;I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; sung by The Soggy Bottom Boys. Not everyone will enjoy this album; this is music in it's most pure form, sung straight from the heart without any technological gadgets, synthesized pop rhythms, or temptatious visual gimmicks. Nevertheless, anyone with the least bit appreciation of music will find something enjoyable on this album.<br />Some have suggested that this album is a tribute to the lost musical heritage of our nations deep rural culture. This is not true. Though it maybe true that you probably won't hear music like this played on many radio stations, one can listen to music like this played in churches, restaurants, schools, festivals, and camps throughout the country. Great music like this lives on and thanks to O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? a whole host of new people have been introduced to it.

0805028846|5.0|This is a great book. The author starts with very basic, simple cuts and folds, and progresses through more difficult techniques.<br />The book has very clear, step-by-step instructions, and photos of completed samples.  Each technique explained also shows several variations, along with a completed project.  You won't find instructions for all of the completed projects though, (the bird on the cover, for example), because I think the idea is for you to experiment on your own, using the techniques illustrated in the book.<br />I found the size of the book to be a big help.  Print you can actually read and photos that are a good size.  All around nice book.

As soon as I would recover I'd read another sentence, or even another phrase, and off I'd go again. It got so bad that the tears of laughter splashed onto the lenses of my glasses. I was actually crying from laughing; I had to blow my nose and everything. <br />OK, I think I'm nearly ready to go back in. I suggest you join me.
B000055QHO|5.0|A Day Without Rain, Enya's latest heralded achievement, was missing something in my estimation.  The US pressing was a meager 34 minutes, and just didn't feature the same passionate Gaelic songs of her other masterpieces, Watermark and Shepherd Moons.  As a devoted fan of Enya's, I was intrigued by the Japanese pressing of the album, because of the very rare bonus track, Isobella.  I was not disappointed by it in the least, upon receiving this import album a few months ago.  It is a vast improvement over the US pressing and Aussie pressing of the album.  Isobella, track 11, is an amazing piece with Gaelic lyrics written by Enya herself.  While the title doesn't translate, the song itself transcends language boundaries.  It's an atmospheric masterpiece with stunning voice layering and clear and distinct lyrics that surround one in what Enya defines as a veritable \\"wall of sound.\\"  Comprised of a lighter section of music and then a more passionate, earnest section of music, it exemplifies why Enya is one of the top recording artists of our time.  Beyond this track, other bonuses include a lyric booklet that is printed on harder material, an additional booklet containing an interview with Enya in Japanese and translated lyrics, and a disc that is evergreen on light green versus the red on seafoam of the US release.  While I own all three versions of A Day Without Rain, this is clearly the most prized and most stunning of all.  I truly recommend this cd, especially for collectors.<br />Track listing: 1. A Day Without Rain (2:38) 2. Wild Child (3:47) 3. Only Time (3:38) 4. Tempus Vernum (2:24) 5. Deora ar mo Chroí (2:48) 6. Flora's Secret (4:07) 7. Fallen Embers (2:31) 8. Silver Inches (1:37) 9.

B00005JKQX|3.0|Interesting story, whether accurate or not.  Excellent acting by Crowe, Connelly and, as always, Ed Harris.  Way too long, the story could have been adequately & eloquently told in under 2 hours.  <br />And the music!  The entire viewing experience would have been more captivating and less maudlin with an occasional change in tempo.  I found myself thinking too often \\"I got the point half an hour ago, move on.\\"  <br />Too bad.  I really like Ron Howard movies, appreciate a good story, and such outstanding acting is not to be overlooked or undermined.  My recommendation is to make sure you are in a very patient frame of mind when you head out the door to see this one.  You will be glad you didn't waste your movie money on a mindless action film or one of the ever-prevalent animated adventures, but this movie may put you in the mood to see another movie!<br />Sorry, Opie.
B000056H5J|4.0|While Enya seemed a little aimless and misdirected on the US version of A Day Without Rain, it was a very strong achievement for any artist, it just simply didn't live up to the previous precedents she has set with other albums like Watermark and The Memory of Trees. Backed by the singles Only Time (which went #1 in Germany and Canada, and #10 here in the United States) and Wild Child, which are all stunning and complemented by truthful, meaningful lyrics, this Aussie pressing of ADWR improves upon the US version with the edition of The First of Autumn, Enya's most stirring instrumental to date. Complete with strings, cello, violins, and a plethora of other stringed instruments it's a passionate, sensual song that is complemented with stunning voices by Enya. It's an absolute stunning piece that adds more time and a different perspective to A Day Without Rain. While some of the pieces on the album may be a bit stiff and austere (Tempus Vernum, Silver Inches), songs like The First of Autumn and One by One are absolutely stunning and show why Enya is one of the most paramount artist of our time. I recommend this cd if you're a fan of Enya's pieces and were looking for something more than the meager 34 minute US pressing of A Day Without Rain.<br />Track listing: 1.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of the most innovated films of 2000 and a really cool movie to watch---you'll need to watch it more than once to catch everything and even then you'll still have questions.  That, however, is the beauty of this film.  Told in reverse and in snap shots, the story is slowly revealed and it is absolutely spellbinding.  I won't go into details because I don't want to reveal too much but it is a great way to spend a night with friends and a big bowl of popcorn.  Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, as are Carrie-Anne Moss (&quot;The Matrix&quot;) and Joe Pantoliano (&quot;The Matrix&quot; and tv's &quot;The Sopranos&quot;).  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKYS|2.0|Mel Gibson and company are soldiers surrounded by overwhelming odds in the Ia Drang Valley during the Vietnam War. Graphically violent film features almost non-stop fighting after the first hour. Technically, the battle scenes are well-choregoraphed, but those sequences never achieve the \\"you are there\\" feeling, and the film completely lacks in genuine dramatic power and nail-biting intensity. The character development is second-rate, the symbolism is heavy-handed...This is what happens when...people try to meditate on the meaning of brotherhood. Good message, but poorly executed. This has nothing on Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down.
B00005Y228|5.0|After her hit single, &quot;Locomotion&quot;, in the 80s, Americans pretty well turned their back on Kylie Minogue.  Though she has had continued success in Europe, we weren't paying attention.  Hopefully that will change with the release of her new cd, &quot;Fever&quot;.  This set of songs revisits disco and is well worth a listen.  With the first single in heavy rotation (Can't Get You Out of My Head) and a second single poised for release, we are gonna see a lot more of this Aussie import.  &quot;Give it to Me&quot;, &quot;Dancefloor&quot; and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; are great dance songs that make you wanna jump up and dance til you drop.  The American cd includes two bonus songs, &quot;Boy&quot; and &quot;Buttefly&quot;.  &quot;Boy&quot; is the better of the two but both are as good as the rest of the cd.  Interestingly, some of the songs are produced by Cathy Dennis, another dance pop artist who had some minor success in the 90s---the first released single being one of her productions. I highly recommend this cd for anyone who likes good dance music.
B00003CXB7|2.0|This movie was really made poorly. First of all, the sound quality on this DVD is terrible. I had to put subtitles on just so I could understand what they were saying. On top of that there are scenes where everybody is talking over each other. It's very frustrating for the viewer to try and figure out what is going on. As far as the movie goes it's not really a movie. There's no one plot. It's like a whole bunch of TV episodes put together. The TV show is better than this movie in every way. The show really makes you understand the hell these people were going through and you knew they acted goofy because it was the only way to keep their sanity. In this movie you never feel that these doctors are stressed out or even bothered that they're fixing people just so they can go out and get killed. The cast from the show is far superior than the cast in this movie. If you're a fan of the show like me you'll probably want to see this movie but I suggest you rent it. If you're not a fan of the show avoid this movie.
B000002LEU|5.0|There has never been a band like Joy Division, before or after. Somehow, something happened to make three masterful musicians and one great poet come together in Manchester, and these songs are the result. Joy Division's music has always taken me places I never dreamed of, conjured images I never saw before, and evoked emotions of unbridled intensity. I heartily lament that I never saw them live. Anyway, in their brief existence they recorded only two full albums. The first is a classic of rock music, inspiration of many great artists for years to come, and a study in turbulent anxiety. The second is a masterpiece of music, transcending genres and languages, building whole worlds and knocking them down in four or five minutes of a song. By then, the anger had been replaced with quiet resignation, and Ian Curtis committed suicide soon after. But that's hardly it. Joy Division never did anything like anyone else, and as part of this, they released absolutely smashing singles that never appeared on albums. So this record, Substance, is a collection of their singles, B-sides, promotional songs, and contributions to compilations of then-contemporary Manchester music. And while it's not entirely as consistent as the studio albums, it's mind-blowing in most places.<br />For starters, we get the EP &quot;An Ideal For Living.&quot; Back then, Joy Division were Joy Division in name only, not having found their sound, just beginning to shed their punk roots. Ian hadn't yet found his voice and the boys were just discovering the mysterious fourth chord. For this reason, the four songs on this EP don't come close to anything they did later. And yet, &quot;Warsaw&quot; is more than a historical curiosity, filled with undated menace and energy, and possessed of a very anthemic refrain in the cryptic line &quot;three one G.&quot; The other three are weaker, though &quot;No Love Lost,&quot; with its lengthy, moody intro, is certainly a disturbing little number. Next we come to something else entirely - &quot;Digital&quot; and its B-side &quot;Glass,&quot; Joy Division proper's first single with the inimitable Martin Hannett as producer. Here, Ian had already mastered his formidable voice, making these oblique declarations of despair much more immediate. This was still a far cry from perfection, but it was better, and by their next single - &quot;Transmission&quot; with B-side &quot;Novelty&quot; - they had already reached greatness. &quot;Transmission&quot; is a stunner, an impossibly fast, visceral, urgent song with a beautiful, hypnotic refrain (&quot;dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio&quot;), some wonderful guitar work, and lyrics that are resonant even if they do unnecessarily quote some book by Aleister Crowley in the first verse. &quot;Novelty,&quot; though worthwhile, is less inspiring, mainly because the lyrics date back to pre-Joy Division days and seem kind of out of place at this point. Next we see &quot;Autosuggestion&quot; and its companion &quot;From Safety to Where?&quot;, gleaned from some godforsakenly obscure compilation - the former is eerie and atmospheric (sounding somewhat like &quot;I Remember Nothing,&quot; the closer of their first studio album), and the latter is a beautiful, quiet rumination, a true gem rescued from obscurity by this CD. What then follows is an interesting alternate take on &quot;She's Lost Control&quot; (from their first studio album), with more prominent drums and an extended outro, which features some beautiful, unworldly string/synths. <br />And THEN, ladies and gentlemen, after we've already been knocked to the floor a few times, Joy Division top even that. First we get yet another obscure gem - &quot;Komakino,&quot; with its meandering instrumental B-side &quot;Incubation,&quot; rescued from some little record that was given away for free as part of a promotional gimmick by their label. No other song has ever created such an atmosphere of mystery - the first line, &quot;this is the hour when the mysteries emerge,&quot; sums it up perfectly well. But after this song, whose lyrics would have fit Hamlet's soliloquy, they top even that. &quot;Atmosphere&quot; and its B-side &quot;Dead Souls&quot; make up arguably the best single ever recorded by anyone anyplace anytime ever. &quot;Atmosphere&quot; is a low-key, hauntingly poignant plea from someone increasingly farther away, and &quot;Dead Souls&quot; is absolutely harrowing, veritably burning in intensity as Ian Curtis paints a chilling picture of someone being inexorably called by some mysterious supernatural force.<br />After this, wouldn't it be amazing if the last two songs managed to top even that? No other band could do it, but Joy Division aren't any other band, so that's exactly what happens. &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; became Joy Division's most recognized song, and for good reason. A hauntingly sad portrayal of love slowly and inevitably breaking down, with Curtis's voice filled with a sort of fatalistic tenderness, it's just unforgettable. Its B-side &quot;These Days&quot; may not be as unreservedly amazing, but it's pretty great in its own right. An anxious, understated rhythm with some razor-sharp guitar breaks provides the backdrop - Ian Curtis's voice at first seems unnecessarily harsh, but gains enormous emotive force when you hear him sing &quot;Please stay for these days&quot; and realize that it's more like choking on tears than harsh shouting. And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes Substance - it misses many things, but they're available elsewhere, on CDs such as the other compilation &quot;Still,&quot; or their studio albums, and should you not own them, it's time to hurry to purchase all of them at once (or, alternately, the box set &quot;Heart and Soul,&quot; which contains more or less everything they ever recorded).
B00005UKKF|5.0|I'll admit, I'm a HUGE Britney fan, which might skew this review a bit in her favor. But I'm also an avid concert goer and, let me tell you, this is quite the show!!! Yes, she does lip-sync, but let's face it, it takes nothing away from the production. You will be utterly amazed by the special effects at this concert and her dancing is superb. The music still sounds great whether she's singing or not. Plus, with all those dance moves, you can't blame her for needing to lip sync. I'm one of those who would rather sacrifice the voice for the production.<BR>I was lucky enough to see this Las Vegas show in person, and the DVD does a great job of capturing the concert. In fact, I was able to get an even better view of all I had missed. Only things missing from the DVD are special features and a multiple-angle viewing option.<BR>Britney fan or not, if you want to see out-of-this-world show then this DVD is a must!

B00004Y7SF|2.0|First off, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of Christina Aguilera and I think that she has one of the best voices of the last few years but I can't lie to yall and say that this album is good. It ain't. Point blank. Of course the album has its high points (Angels We Have Heard On High, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song, and These Are Special Times) but these moments are few and far between.The main problem is that between her recording her album &quot;Mi Reflejo&quot; and this one she somehow forgot how to &quot;sing&quot;. Instead of singing she just yells at the top of her lungs and never holds a note longer than 3 seconds before she begins riffing uncontrollably. I don't want to go any further because, like I said, I am a HUGE fan of Ms. Aguilera so I KNOW she can do better.<br />I recommend this to FANS ONLY. If you're just looking for a good Christmas album I would suggest you go with &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; by Mariah Carey instead.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Steven Spielberg's AI is a very thought provoking movie.  The performance by Haley Joel Osment is excellent.  Judd Law also offers a very good supporting role as a luvbot, Giggalo Joe.  Based on the story of Pinnochio this movie explores a possible future in which robots take the step from machine intelligence to the realm of emotional intelligence.  At times the movie can be corny but essentially it is moving tale of awakening, loss, a journey, finding and then losing again.  In addition, there are many fine cinematic touches which are reminescent of Stanley Kubrick to whom the movie was dedicated.  Perhaps not destined to become a \\"Blade Runner\\" nevertheless, in many respects A.I. explores in much greater depth the moral conflicts which may arise as machine intelligence becomes a reality.
B0000029GA|5.0|I actually heard of Nas for the first time from his 'It Was Written' album, and I loved that CD.  But, after exploring into 'Illmatic', his second album seemed rather monotonous and sub-par compared with his debut album...But it's unfair to compare an artist's earlier work with his later products, but this album is essential to listen to for the Nas fans who haven't explored into it yet...<br />After 'It Was Written' dropped Nas adopted a thug-like personality dropping some street knowledge every now and then, but WHERE DID IT START?  On Illmatic...<br />'Illmatic' is a hiphop classic, with his storytelling quick delivery and production backed up by DJ Premiere, Pete Rock, Q-tip, Large Professor, and others.  Not only do you have an intelligent lyricist, but you have high credited beat makers.  Nas shines on each track and all them are memorable.  The ONLY downside to this CD is that it just ends too soon, you want to hear more...<br />Buy this album whether you're a Nas fan or not!<br />I'm out... Mind Power!
B00005V0X5|5.0|It was summer 1985. My friends and I had been partying to the likes of Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Motley Crue. In the midst of beer and bongs, somebody puts on a record that was to become my personal speed metal epiphany, \\"Killing is my Business...\\"  I'm sure my jaw must have dropped as the intro \\"Last Rites\\" smashed reeling into \\"Loved to Deth\\". Thereafter my world of music was to be forever changed. Although \\"Rust in Peace\\" is perhaps my all time personal favorite metal album, \\"Killing\\" provides the pure fury and angst of Dave Mustaine in his prime. This album can still send cold shivers down my spine. The newly remixed and remastered version shows with renewed clarity the passion and sheer virtuosity of this band, and showcases Mustaine's talent as the consummate rock guitarist. The demo tracks reveal even more vehemently the pure venom, hunger and determination of Dave at this period in his life - purely insane riffs of blood, guts and darkness. Unfortunately, the countdown to extinction began after \\"Rust\\". With each successive album, Megadeth began the long, slow process of decay known as sell out. No longer focused and hungry, but satiated with the deth knell of the business industry, Megadeth is no longer the vicious animal of yesteryear. \\"Hero\\" was a half-hearted attempt to return to some semblance of those glory days, but only managed a few rare sparks of that black flame which burned in the heart of the great guitar master of \\"Killing\\". If you like the original for it's raw and distorted sound quality, simply play this new version and stick your head in the sink with the garbage disposal on! And so kiddies, the production and clarity of this classic album can now be experienced at the top end of the volume knob. Crank it up and relive the essence of what real metal is all about. Remember Dave for the true talent and genius he was (and to be fair, still has the potential to be). Vic says, \\"RATTLE ON\\"!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore I think did an absolutely outstanding job on this soundtrack... He captured the elegance and gracefulness of elves, to the merry and nonchalant ways of Hobbits. His work is powerful, inspiring to listen to. When you listen to it, you can right away depict what its trying to say. I find myself listening to it over, and over again, being pulled into Tolkiens world of Wizards, Orcs, and magic. I probably listen to track #17 about 20 times a day... especially when Edward Ross sings that little verse at the end...it always moves me to tears. I recomend HIGHLY of getting this CD, if you havent already (especially if your a Tolkien fan)!
B00004STPT|5.0|Your soundtrack was more than mystic, historical, haunting.  it was miraculous.  Each person who hears it has a different feeling, but this is mine:  The mortality, his hand caressing the wheat stalks at the beginning; the little robin flying away; Maximus jolted back to reality of battle, the general's powerful theme (I think, the best march composed since Sousa), the thrilling, visceral effect of the music in the battle scenes; the &quot;Gladiator Waltz&quot; (which permeates the whole score); the torment of Commodus the unloved; Maximus's slavery (Yes, We Were Entertained); and on to Rome and the Colosseum and his first triumph over &quot;Scipio&quot;; his ultimate agony in chains and, then his freedom from this life as he was (to me, hearing through Lisa) Selene softly calling him home--this music is incomparable.<BR>I believe the freedom at the end is open to any interpretation and that was mine.<BR> <BR>To this day, after a year, I still keep a separate CD player with nothing but the Gladiator score which affects me so strongly in so many ways.  As a grandmother raising a young grandson, I need strength, and music--especially this soundtrackk--is a great help.<br />It will echo in eternity.
0140177396|5.0|I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed.  In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck).  It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm.  They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems.  Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream.  All around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasn't yet read it.
B000002UAF|5.0|This album, instead of having 8 songs and 6 covers, has all originals. There is a definite progression on Hard Day's Night than on the other 2 albums. John's singing is a lot better. And George's 12 string sounds great. I recently saw a picture of his 12 string that he used on &quot;Hard Day's Night,&quot; and it's still in great condition. The best tunes are the title track, &quot;And I Love Her,&quot; &quot;I'll Cry Instead,&quot; and &quot;Can't Buy Me Love.&quot; No bad songs on this album, so im giving it a 5 out of 5. Brilliant songs with brilliant hooks.
B00004R99I|1.0|If Disney wanted to do a good deed, in preaching the children of today to look around the riverbend, then they failed dreadfully. Pocahontas is the spirit of good, the body of health and the mind of insanity. Although her sermons are well-meant, she cannot help but provoke the viewer into throwing their TV out the window. <BR>Here are a few comments on some of the main points in the movie:<br />1. If someone thought they could provide a thrilling story, they were wrong. The story of the native-american tomboy (Pocahontas)  is totally predictable and very much less than thrilling, i.e. young rebelous girl is to marry according to tradition (Kocoum), she decides she must go against her tribe and her father (the chief) to be true to herself and falls in love with someone bound to bring an end to her people. All in all, a completely irratating (at least when seen on tape) story, which one should rent if one ever wanted to be guaranteed sickness.<br />2. As for the music: From the fast-forwarded lines of \\"Just around the Riverbend\\" to the highly preachy, idealistic messages of \\"Colors of the Wind\\", although some of the words were quite nicely put together, the music, which in most Disney films is outstanding, was annoying and came to be like the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard. More to \\"Colors of the Wind\\": If you really do walk in the footsteps of a stranger and do learn things  you never knew you never knew, I'd hope you'd learn something useful,like how to harvest some yellow corn, instead of hearing the wolf cry to the blue corn moon.<br />3. The animals are also incompetent [pitiful] creatures. Maybe I could have liked the racoon and bird, but then I noticed that they liked Pocahontas, and that turned me off. <br />4. The only thing I liked in the whole movie (the reason it got    <BR>1 star), was the talking tree. Although it was very story-ish and obviously trying to bring the native-american beliefs to light, it was such an absurd idea that it was actually appealing (tree=grandmother).<br />Conclusion: Try again, Disney!<BR>(Hercules was a wonderful recovery!)<br />Writers ages are 10 and 14
B00004T1NA|5.0|Porcupine Tree have hit a musical nerve with me.<br />After 43 years of listening to good music I now realize it was all just a prelude to Porcupine Tree. This album is amazing.<br />I own almost all of their music. When I leave for work or use my computer I must listen to something by Porcupine Tree.<br />Lightbulb Sun as well as another truly fantastic album called Stupid Dream will make you think &quot;Wow, excellent music is alive and well&quot;.<br />Get it &gt;&gt; You will love it
B00005YU1O|4.0|The problem with most of the promotional and review material associated with this film is that it all seems to take the same starting point: namely, that Waking Life is a prettily-animated philosophical [insert preferred euphemism for \\"self-abuse\\" here] session. I'll concede that a large amount of time is devoted to just such activity, but I posit that Waking Life also functions as a Zen adventure story and a rather wry comedy (with humor ranging from black to cute).<br />I took my sister and her BF to see this one at the Capitol (OFS) Theater (Olympia's arthaus of champions), expecting (as various reviews had portrayed the movie) something pretty, largely incoherent, and pretentious enough to provide plenty of unintentional fun. But WL actually posesses both plot and structure, and although some of the individual encounters the main character is involved in carry something of a pretentious air, the overall story is simple, well-integrated into the disjointed structure dictated by the overarching theme of dreaming, and (I thought) rather beautiful. <br />Similarly, the wry humor of the movie should be mentioned in any review of WL. Many of the chuckles are character-based, like the 'go-for-broke' beer salute of the biker/dreamwalker, or the riotous cynicism of the gas-station attendent (neither my sister nor I can even think about microwavable burritos anymore without remembering his story about the vision-quester), but the occasional gonzo visual jest or uncomfortable giggle are sure to make their appearance.<br />Finally, I'd like to say that the Phil 101 course-supplement material should be neither overvalued nor undervalued. In response to those who praise WL as the most! significant! movie! ever!, I'd like to remind that nothing particularly new is presented here, and that enlightenment-seekers would be better off hitting the shelves. To those who write it all off as simply pretentious wankery, I argue that it actually serves a purpose within the spare narrative that the movie is based around, and that although none of it is intended to be accepted at face value by the audience, contemplating the steady flow of 'ideas on feet' can have an overall mind-opening effect that helps us to identify with the drifting main character.<br />Anyhow, I was thoroughly entertained by this movie while watching it, and it left me with a fair amount to talk about afterwards (including the topic of lucid dreaming, which can be a rewarding investigation). Not only that, but it's very much unlike anything else I've seen recently, which makes it a nice palate-cleanser for the entertainment taste buds. 4 stars, and I'm buying it when it hits DVD.
B000059HAI|4.0|.....That was the signal to attack on Dec, 07.  ..This is probably the BEST movie concerning this subject.  Gripping &amp; exciting all the way through.  I much prefer finding out what the Japaneese are thinking and doing, in the days &amp; weeks before this brillant sneak attack,.... than have a verry slow and corny love triangle provide the prologue for an exciting snapshot in history.  If you haven't seen it by now, order now!!  You won't be dissappointed!
B000001FS3|4.0|The Joshua Tree is one of those albums that has assumed a certain aura of signifigance leading to such high expectations that itmight initially disappoint. Yet it is one where you can see how the aura arose and why it is deserved. This is the apex of the driving, anthemic 80s rock that U2 personified and mastered. I do not claim it is their masterpiece; that would come with Achtung Baby, when the band dipped into other musical influences and expand its lyrical horizons into the more highly personal. Nevertheless, The Joshua Tree is a landmark . Nowhere else in the U2 catalog, nor from the time period, will you find an album with such focus, clarity, and immaculate sense of purpose. Daniel Lanois' signature production methods and Brian Eno's singularities give just the right feel. From the opening keyboard swells and neo-psychedelic guitar of \\"Where The Streets Have No Name,\\" you know you're in for an epic. While U2's prior albums had been more politically overt, they were also less mature and perhaps slightly naive at times. The Joshua Tree was their coming of age. Here you have a dark, mature album both musically -- with expansive guitar chords, production values, and sheer epic drive --, and certainly lyrically. The American influence had also begun to seep in. You can feel it in the music, which has an obvious occasional blues leaning (hear Bono whip out the harmonica), and certainly in the words. The band is in tight form throughout. The Edge is the absolute master of guitar atmospherics, as he proves here. The underrated Adan Clayton/Larry Mullen, Jr. rhythm section is also in fine form. And, of course, there is the voice of Bono. As usual with U2, the best songs are stacked at the top (in this case, three huge singles and a concert staple), but they're hardly the only fine songs . Other gems abound: the emotioal tour-de-force Red Hill Mining Town, the enigmatic Running To Stand Still, and others. Some (Bullet The Blue Sky, Mothers of The Disappeared) are perhaps a bit clumsy in their pretentiousness, but such is U2, and such were the 80s. There's no denying the uniform excellence. This has become an essential rock record.ps a bit clumsy in their pretentiousness, but such is U2, and such were the 80s. There's no denying the uniform excellence.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|It's a very gimmicky, but entertaining movie.  The main point is being entertaining.  My 85 (yes, eighty five) year-old mother enjoyed the movie.<br />It has a format which I think is trying for cult status.  But with the tons of extas, the DVD is well worth the price.  There is something that will keep you wanting to view the package.
B00005NZBN|5.0|I had listened to this album millions and millions of times, wondering how Bob Dylan could make such a comeback. With songs like &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; and &quot;Honest With Me&quot; on an album, it's already good enough. But then, my dad bought the double disc special edition, and it was even better. Yes, I may be making a big deal that it has only two songs, but they're early, raw, and wonderful sounding Bob Dylan tunes. The first song, &quot;I Was Young When I Left Home,&quot; is very early, 1961 to be exact. It sounds great, and also it is the first public release of the song. The second song, an alternate version of &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin',&quot; is almost as good as the final cut. If you buy this album, good for you. It's a great album by itself and you will have many years of listening enjoyment. But if you buy the special edition &quot;Love And Theft,&quot; you're getting more then you're paying for!
B00004T37H|5.0|I loved this movie most not because of the great characters or the sweat action. Not the great plot or wonderful animation but because every line was said so perfectly it makes you feel all wobbly.<BR>The script is amazing. The whole thing about \\"seeing with eyes unclouded by hate\\". Who comes up with something so perfect, so ingenius oh it's amazing.<BR>Another great thing about this movie is the director can make you feel however he wants you to feel. You can hear your heart pound at all the dramatic seens, you laugh your eyes out at all the funny scenes. You say \\"sw e e e e ttttt\\" in a hoarse gasp at all the action seens.<BR>A strange thing about this maovie is they got alot of famous people to do the dubbing. Boy am I glad they did too. they did such a perfect job (like a said earlier)<BR>In princess mononoke There is no direct good or evil. You have to decide for your self.<BR>All that and its 2 and a half hours long. A must see and a must buy.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I saw this movie last night.It was disappointing.The dialogue in this movie was awful,the love story did not work,especially with the... lines that the actors were spraying.The action scenes were impressive but they were not enough to get me to recommend the movie to the whole.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I am a fan of Diana Krall and have several of her CD's.  and I too am disappointed in this album.  I must have counted a 100 disappointed reviews in here-- really depressing.   Then I discovered Dena DeRose!  If you haven't listened to Dena, you will be in for great listening Jazz experiencence. Dena really is a unique talent with a clear, exciting voice, an accomplished jazzz pianist, she arranges, and composes for her albums, accompanies herself and her  solos  are  of a jazz intellect that are melodic and exciting and smooth.I listen to her albums constantly, and never tire of them, because with each listening, I feel  something new. Although  Dena is relatively unknown as DK, I think  she will be a contender of Diana's.  I certainly was not disappointed with Dena DeRose. Win me back Diana, with your next album.
B00003CXTG|1.0|My mouth was open for the entire movie.....it was that bad.This movie is a total disaster.Nuff said.Apparently I need four lines for this review,but I can't say any more.
1878424319|1.0|This book manages to be both incredibly bland and infuriatingly trite.  If the editors had removed all the repetitious drivel it would have been four pages long.  It certainly does NOT &quot;read in a voice you would expect from an indigenous shaman&quot; unless you're easily persuaded by sophmoric attempts at parody.  Either this is satire or the New Age industry has sunk to an all-time low.
B000002UAU|5.0|As I am writing this, I am paradoxically listening to &quot;Revolver.&quot;  However, it only seems to enhance the overall effect and poewer of Sgt. Pepper's.  <br />With over 500 reviews written on this one album alone, much more has been said than I could possibly sum up, or ever hope to expand upon.  Knowing that, I still have to say that I love this album and have ever since my friend gave me an LP re-issue when I was 12 years old.  This music, as all of the Beatle's music is a part of my parent's generation, but somehow that doesn't seem to matter much.  What matters is how easily the music on Sgt. Pepper's crosses from one generation to the next.<br />People keep wanting to talk about the uneven quality of the music, how it falls short of a unified theme, or it's over produced.  I can't help but think to myself that I must have missed out on some important lecture on music theory back in highschool, because I am astounded at how wonderful and seamless the music feels every time I listen to Sgt. Pepper's.  Of course the songs were heavily produced.  All of the Beatles were feeling more reflective, having given up live concert performances with the intent of concentrating their efforts in the studio.<br />What I think is people have their favorite songs, and they get hung up on that song or set of songs and they stop allowing Sgt. Pepper's to come across as a single unit.  If you pull each song out of the sequence to be examined, of course the unity of the album is lost.  The whole point of the album in my opinion is to hear all of the songs at once, rather than in the single format.  Of course, that is no real secret, the Beatles said as much themselves, but it sounds as if people don't want to do that any longer.<br />My humble opinion is that this album is not only significant, but of a quality that places it among the best music ever recorded by anyone in any genre.  Enjoy.

B000006TRV|5.0|In my opinion, this is the deepest and most revolutionary album ever released. The album doesn't have any real meaning until you discover the story behind it. My favorites will be listed, with reasoning <br />1. \\"Mother\\"- it's asking his mother if he should shelter himself from the world, which seems to have turned against him at the time in his life. But at the end, he realizes that the Wall (his psychological block of the world) was built too high, which resulted in him turning to drugs and all the temptations of rock and roll stardom. This is a brilliantly done song, #1 on my list of this album. <br />2. I dont think I have much room left, so I'll stop on this. \\"In the Flesh.\\", with a period. It explains how horrible society was at the time of WWII. It demonstrates how unethical and wrong Hitler and the Nazis were during the time, and that he knew it. I like this because it has such a deep meaning when you think about it. Well, you just have to listen to understand. THIS SONG SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS A SONG SUPPORTING RACISM! It is exactly the opposite, actually. <br />I hope I helped in your decision to purchase this album.
B000000W8C|5.0|That sums it up.  This record is raw, intense, atmospheric, emotive, chilling, and it definitely lurks somewhere in my top 10 of favorite albums.  Probably my vote for best rock album of the 90s.  The Verve had serious chemistry on ANS and played more original, honest, intelligent, and complex music than their more marketed UK or US contemporaries.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer is perhaps an anomaly among the newest artists. He's not asking for or providing deep statements on his music. Nonetheless, his music is so pleasant and calming that you can skip past the lyrical depth (or rather, the lack of) and just sit back and enjoy.<br />The opener, \\"No Such Thing,\\" is a clear example of this. The words themselves aren't too intelligent, but the sound and the way that Mayer presents them are together quite tough to resist, especially with the falsetto harmonizing in the refrain. It's pure pop/rock, but it's not nearly as bland as, say, Better Than Ezra.<br />The rest of the album works pretty much the same way. Mayer's voice is genuine and enthusiastic about his music; he never sounds whiny or annoyed. A great track is \\"Your Body is a Wonderland,\\" continuing the de-sleaze-ification of America, returning sex from Ludacris back to somewhere in the middle between Puritan and Madonna. Mayer puts the love back into, um, loving.<br />The biggest quirk is, of course, track 13. Check, there is none listed in his list of songs. In fact, track 13 is less than one second. I couldn't spell the word for the fear of 13, but Mayer certainly has it.<br />Not that he needs to avoid the number, he's got a great album here. It's not quite classic material, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it by his next album.
B000050XEI|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Enya and this is the best CD I've bought yet! This album lefts you oof the Earth, it is so great. I highly recommend  it.
0960191038|5.0|Anyone who relies on sharing ideas with colleagues, clients or staff should read a book like this.  But hardly any of use do.<br />It's a deceptively short book at a couple of hundred pages, but very economically written - Minto practices what she preaches.  Excellent use of worked examples, case studies and diagrams.<br />I've found that communicating complex ideas to others is now much easier, and related to this (of course) is the improved clarity and structure of my own thinking.<br />Pity about the price, but worth it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I absolutely loved the music, the costumes, the story and the cast!  It couldn't have been more perfect!!  I watch movies to be taken away from reality and movies like Magnolia that depress me and show the worst side of society are a waste of my time.  This movie made me want to be in love again and took me to places I'd never been.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were excellent and the way they took the look of Christian from an innocent writer to the devasted, broken-hearted man he became was incredible.  It felt like you were there and could feel his pain and loss.
0060975768|5.0|I read this book while on vacation last summer and I still find myself thinking about it and its' many unforgettable images of war.  This is a first-hand account of the first major US battle of the Viet Nam conflict.  The author is the commanding officer of the conflict and, while he allows himself a bit of the glory, he makes his men the heroes of his combat history.  We get a reasonable amount of background of the events leading to the conflict and the units that will be engaged for the US.  This is helpful yet not overdone and we find ourselves following the troops into their field assignment.  They were hoping to engage the enemy and the battle began shortly after the first troops were land by helicopter.  The strength of this book is the way Colonel Moore takes us through the ensuing battle moment by moment.  If this sounds like it would be tedious reading, it isn't.  The US forces were facing numbers roughly five times their own and the combat was relentless.  We come to know many of the American GI's and, to his credit, Moore gives us the name of everyone involved no matter how brief his appearance in the book.  There is a helpful &quot;Where are they now&quot; section at the end that is much appreciated;  the reader goes through a lot with these men and most of us do want to know how their lives turned out.  As the one battle subsides and many are relieved, another battle soon erupts between the relieving forces and the enemy some distance away.  This battle gives us an even greater sense of presence in the combat. One battle is a great success while another is quite a different outcome.  Moore does a good job in evaluating why.  As a matter of fact, he does a good job of analyzing where we went wrong in our Vietnamese experience.  For those of us who came of age during this conflict, it might be hard to acknowledge some of the facts that he lays on us.  However, it isn't hard to find ourselves caught up in the courage and sacrifice of our troops.  Althoughit comes a generation or two too late, it felt good after all these years to chear for the good guys.

B00003CXXP|5.0|#1: Those beings in act 4 are super advanced robots, not aliens. They are the evolutionary descendants of David, machines with full emotional capabilities.<br /><br />#2: David does not merely simulate love, he genuinely feels it. Many people reject this premise at the outset, unable to accept the notion that the emotions we feel boil down to neurons in our brains firing in specific patterns, and that an artificial brain could conceivably do the same thing.<br /><br />#3: Speilberg was faithful to Kubrick's vision. Speilberg wrote the screenplay himself, but he did not deviate from the story treatment completed years earlier by Ian Watson with input from Sara Maitland, under Kubrick himself. e.g. Kubrick's version of the story didn't end with David trapped under the Ferris wheel. It continued on to 2000 years in the future, just as seen in the movie.<br /><br />There is a lot of info out there that predates the production of the film by several years, if you care to look for it.
B000001ESN|5.0|Rush were a mystery to me. I hated Test for echo, and dismissed them as a crummy alternative band. Please forgive me Geddy, Alex and Neil, you guys are great! One day I felt like giving Rush another chance, so I downloaded Natural Science, on a whim, and on the spot I knew I had been wrong all along, this was a band well worth checking out. Unlike some progrock bands, Rush's music is warm and sounds very down to earth. These three guys are very tight, and play their respective instruments with passion and feeling. <br />This is the only Rush album I have so far, I bought it purely for Natural Science, but found out it is not the only gem on the album. I can honestly day that all six songs on Permanent Waves are great. While many people start with Moving Pictures (their most poplular album), I, as a rule, never buy the best selling album from any band I am curious about, but I don't doubt that Moving Pictures is great. Their are some synths on here, but they blend in very well with the overall songs, and fit in nicely. Geddy's voice is great, looking at his picture in the albumn sleeve I wonder whether he has some native american blood in him. <br />Well this CANADIAN TRIO does my home country pround!!!<BR>Highly reccomended!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I thought this was a great CD when I bought 2 or 3 years ago. this was the first Offspring CD I bought, then I bought &quot;Conspiricy of one,&quot; &quot;Smash,&quot; and &quot;Ixnay on the Hombre,&quot; in that order. I liked Smash the best, but this ones right up there. I would definately recommend this CD to anyone.
B000024D4R|4.0|Roger Waters'ego was getting bigger with each album Pink Floyd released after Dark side, so it really comes as no surprise thayt we wrote all of the lyrics and most of the music for Animals.  While some Pink Floyd fans, like me, may yearn the early playful albums like Saucerful of secrets and Piper, that fact is this a great album.  <br />Their are only five songs here.  The first and last clocking in at unnder two minutes (pigs on the wing) while the other three make up for over ninety percent of the album. I guess you're wondering whether this is where you should start with if you're new to Pink Floyd hummm?  Well this was the third Pink Floyd album I got (I suppose almost everyone hears Dark side of the moon first), and I liked it instantly.  Though I'll admit the songs are long, for example dogs is almost twenty minutes, but those twenty or so minutes are nothing but pure genius, tempo changes, guitar solos, nightmarish keyboards and the like.  The songs, despite their lenght, keep you interested, which says something about the musicians and their writting skills.  <br />Gone are the days where the four members contributed and had their share of lyric and song duties.  There is no Remember a day or Bike here.  This is Roger Waters, a lyrical genius with an ego the size of a the state of California.  Still, despite his selfishness, he did write one heck of an album, and I give credit where credit is due.  <br />As far as the overall 'concept' of Animals, well it's based oN a book called Animal Farm by George Orwell.  I feel this is a better 'concept' album than The Wall which was too bloated and hard to follow.

Though it seems uncannily strange in the beginning, you begin to love the loud colors, suggestive dancing, and amazing voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Although a tragic love story, Moulin Rouge is without a doubt THE best movie I have seen in a long time...

B00005UM42|5.0|Talk about a great western, I think Clint Eastwood got a lot from Brando's only directed pic!  The story kept it's pace and a great love story.  But what I loved about what Marlon did was use Latin actors not Anglos pretending to be Latino!  And not done in a stereotypical way either which is really rare for 1961!  Warning the version I saw had no subtitles so if you know Spanish then it's fine but if you don't, then brush up:) or you can view from the acting what is going on.  Absolutely fantastic, Marlon Brando should had directed more flicks!

B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna is continually making me happy with her music and persona.  I have a question...Since her 60 million dollar deal for 7 albums...do her ballad and greatest hits albums count toward that?  If so...she's way smart.  I wonder if the record company thought of that beforehand.  Either way...she's still selling it.  I live in Evansville, IN.  I grew up just down the road from the house of which she stayed during the filming of &quot;A League Of Their Own&quot;.  I was living in North Carolina at the time, but my folks made sure they called me up to tell me she was jogging near by.  I wish I had an opportunity to meet her one day.
0385484518|4.0|This book is a wonderful portration of life.  I enjoyed seeing into the lives of someone else, seeing their trials and separating myself from my own life.  This book can help anyone to see how valuable life is and how we should live it.  You don't have to agree with all the principles they lived by to understand where they're coming from and learn from their experiences.  Another thing I liked about this story was that it was blunt, they did not clean it up and make it pretty for the readers they told it like it was and that makes for a great, true life story.
0743420373|4.0|Living in Santa Monica, I have several millionaires next door, and thus it is not suprising that my image of a millionaire is some one in a Mercedes Benz wearing expensive clothes.  Dr. Stanley and Dr. Danko present the much more interesting and tangible millionaire case.  The most interesting statistic from the millionaires was their answer to the question of <BR>\\"Is your wife more frugal than you?\\"  With most millionaires answering yes, it reinforces what my friend once said, \\"Her money is my money.  My money is her money.  You better go find your purse.\\"  The book stresses saving, saving, saving.  Ironically, if you read this book, you would see how important it is to save your money  and get the book from your library.
B00005A0RI|5.0|I was sent a recommendation via e-mail to grab this CD.  I was having a good Friday and decided to.  Later on that night I was so tired and this CD was able to serve as my &quot;Soundtrack for Relaxation.&quot;  If you like the Cuban sound (bolero, or ballads) mixed with traditional jazz, then this album is for you.  Light some incense, dim the lights, lay back, think simple thoughts, share a few moments with that significant other and ponder the pleasantries of life.  Definitely one for the 5 CD changer.

0767817664|5.0|This gem of a horror film is a true modern-day vampire classic. Chris Sarandon plays the vampire with a lot of enthusiasm. He can be sexy & seductive, while at the same time, monstrously frightening. Roddy McDowell gave one of his finest performances. Kudos to William Ragsdale & the very pretty Amanda Bearse for giving believable performances of two lovestruck teenagers who are involved with the charismatic, yet monstrous vampire. Some comedy elements were added to this film which made this film very enjoyable to watch.<br />All in all, FRIGHT NIGHT is a must-have for all horror film fans.
0553573403|3.0|My opinion is that Martin is a capable writer, but ultimately I didn't really care about the characters or feel that they had any depth.  It was a struggle for me to finish the book, and I feel no compulsion to finish out the trilogy.<br /><br />This book is all mildly interesting political intrigue with very little action.  I have no problem with this except that neither the plot not writing style made this work for me.  The author did nothing new or unique, and has used a lot of rather trite techniques to advance the plot.<br /><br />Everything in my review covers why in my opinion this book is neither great nor outstanding, BUT it is a solid read.  I'm open minded enough to know that some may find this a good book, but I personally would never rave about or recommend this book to anyone.
0440217563|5.0|in 1968 as time-traveler Claire Randall learns that her 18th-century Scottish husband, Jamie Fraser, did not die on the battlefield at Culloden after all.  Twenty years have passed since he sent her back through the stone circle to her own time to give birth to and raise their daughter, Brianna.  After tracking him down with the help of a historian, Claire travels back through the stone circle to 1768 Edinburgh and the timeless love affair continues.  <br />As usual though, trouble seems to follow these two and they are constantly on the run.  When Jamie's 15-year old nephew is kidnapped by a pirate ship, the two set sail for Jamaica to track him down.  They encounter one adventure after another--pirates, typhoid, slavers, witchcraft, voodoo, the Royal Navy--well, you get the picture.  <br />With over 1,000 pages to the paperback edition, Gabaldon sure gives you your money's worth!  As usual, I can't wait to begin the next book in the series (Drums of Autumn).

Even though this is not the kind of books I usually read, I bought it since it was recommended by my therapist.  To my surprise, I found the book pretty good and extremely helpful; I recommend it to any person who is looking for simplicity in their lives (vs. the complexity we so often create in most of our affairs and relationships). I think it could be a great book for those who are in a 12-Step recovery program.
B00000J2KX|4.0|Admittedly not the King novel, this film still manages to frighten in its own way. <br />The beginning is somewhat stilted and there are times you think someone is right next to you, nudging and winking, \\"Oh, yeah, there's trouble ahead. You see it, don't you, huh? Huh?\\" There's also the line-by-line delivery in some of the earlier scenes especially between the cook and the little boy that made me want to scream: \\"Get on with it!\\" It almost seemed like the cook would say something and then look meaningfully at the little boy as if to say, \\"Ahem...it's your line. Now. Today.\\"  Pity Haley Joel Osment wasn't around to take his place.<br />Once you get beyond that, though, the beginning is also an understated stunning opener! Think about it...was the hotel really so menacing when people were walking around? ...Then you get into the meat of the movie, with its abandoned halls and wide, open and VERRRRY quiet spaces, then it becomes extremely menacing. <br />Chilling moments abound in the film. My most notable favorite is Shelley Duvall's discovery of the hundreds of pages with the words ... to almost look like a real book when viewed from afar. The hedge maze is spectacular, although it is sad that the film was made too early to make the hedge monsters a compelling reality. The film's ending (though not spoiled here) differs from the novel, but I liked it so much better...P>The film manages to get under your skin with Jack Nicholson's character development. Worth getting...and it still manages to scare, too!
0385484518|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I really enjoy reading true life stories it makes you want to know more about whats happening.  It gets you involved with the action of the story.  I think Mitch is a great author I feel that he should write more books.  All of those books that have unrealistic things happening sometimes people loose interest mainly those that talk about aliens and monsters and different kinds of stories like that but Tuesdays with Morrie really stirred my interest It made me cry it made me laugh it made me feel as if I was in the story and that I  actually knew Mitch and Morrie and thats what attracts readers well most of them  Usually I am very judgemental when it comes to reviewing books that were assigned to me from school but I think this was the best book I've read.  I wish I could have met Morrie  and been able to talk to him because I'm sure that he would have been really inspirational to me as he was to Mitch.  You can see how much I really enjoyed the book because I didn't see it as just a book I saw it as reality which it was.  I can't stop expressing how much I really enjoyed it.  I think I would like to meet Mitch and actually listen to that tape of the actual Morrie.  I really feel that it wasn't something that you just look at and say I liked that book and then never think about it again I loved it and I still think about it even though I finished it. When I first got the book after reading the first somewhat of a chapter I couldn't put it down i finished it within the first week.  That's why I gave the book 5 stars!
6302054982|5.0|This is simply a great mob movie. Based upon the best selling book, \\"Wiseguy\\", by Nicholas Pileggi, it traces the rise and fall of \\"gansta\\" wannabe turned government informant, Henry Hill. Skillfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this film with its all star cast, megawatt performances, and period music soundtrack packs quite a wallop to the senses. Named 1990's best film by the Los Angeles, New York, and National Society of Film Critics, it garnered six Academy Award nominations and earned Joe Pesci an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br />In the 1950s, a preteen Henry Hill (Christopher Serrone) began his career as a \\"gansta\\" wannabe on the mean streets of East New York, where a small Italian American community thrived. Working with Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino's) crew, he worked his way up, doing the penny ante, gofer stuff, until he began more heavy duty involvement. As a young man, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) took to his life in the underworld like a fish takes to water. He married a nice, jewish girl whom he turned into a shrewish girl, as he lived the life he wanted. His wife, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), also became entranced by the perks available to a mobster<br />Henry teamed up with Jimmy \\"The Gent\\" Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Together they stole, lied, cheated, and killed their way through life, until they got wacked or got caught. When Henry, against the express advice of Paul Cicero, got involved with Jimmy in the 1970s cocaine drug trade, it was the beginning of the end for him and Jimmy. The film skillfully chronicles the rise and fall of Henry Hill from wiseguy to goverment informant in the witness protection program..<br />It is amazing that the actor playing young Henry Hill, Christopher Serrone, resembles Ray Liotta so much, right down to the piercing hazel eyes. He gives a terrific performance as young Henry, expressing all the joie de vivre that young Henry had over being associated with mobsters. Ray Liotta, as the adult Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance. The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives. He clearly enjoys all the perks of a mobster, his only regret being that he could never be a \\"made\\" guy, because he was not fully Italian, as his mother was Sicilian but his father was Irish.<br />Robert DeNiro is wonderful as Jimmy Conway, low key yet powerful. Joe Pesci gives an over the top performance as the wild, volatile, and totally crazy Tommy DeVito, an out of control wiseguy who has no redeeming value as a human being. He is a guy who does not think twice about killing someone over something trivial. Paul Sorvino is excellent as the mob boss who is all about the family and plays it the old fashioned way. Lorraine Bracco gives the performance of her life as Karen Hill, a woman besotted by the life of a mobster's wife, until she realizes that girlfriends are an expected part of that life. She is sensational.<br />This is simply a great mob movie. It is a film that the viewer will watch again and again. I, myself , have seen it at least three or four times, and each time is as if it were the first. Vastly entertaining, this film is a worthy addition to one's collection.Henry Hill, gives an outstanding performance. The viewer senses his absolute love for the life that he lives.

0790734850|5.0|I almost skipped this movie during its theatrical run because the trailer for it was such a jumbled mess.  It left me confused about what kind of movie it would be.  But after it made so many Top Ten lists (not the David Letterman kind) I had to see it, and BOY WAS IT GREAT!!!!!  Complex, noir-ish, well-acted, well-written...  Fantastic on every level.  An intelligent, action-packed, suspenseful nail-biter.  Here's the one problem, though:  Between seeing it twice in the theaters and numerous time at home on DVD, I'm left wondering if there is a cut of it I haven't seen yet.  For some inexplicable reason, Kim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars for this movie.  I've watched this movie a number of times and I cannot recall, even when I was deliberatly watching for it, ANYTHING that she did in this movie to warrant a nomination, to say nothing of a win.  Julianne Moore in BOOGIE NIGHTS that year -- now THERE was an Oscar-caliber performance!  But I didn't see anything in Basinger's role or performance that merited that kind of achievement award.  Maybe I have a \\"bad pressing\\" of the DVD.  Maybe there are scenes missing that everyone else has seen except me.  Yeah, right.  Can anyone out there help me on this?  Basinger's felony theft aside, this DVD packs a lot of punch for your purchasing dollar -- a great film, interesting commentary and behind-the-scenes stuff, and a \\"virtual tour\\" of the Hollywood of old.<br />I hope Julianne Moore filed a police report the night that Basinger won the Oscar, because Moore was ROBBED in broad daylight!

B0000009SY|5.0|This is the best CD set by FZ. It holds together musically, lyrically, and as a concept album from beginning to end. <BR>A garage band guitarist in an anti-music, completely corporate run/sponsored world, illegally plays music. He goes on the lam, gets sucked into L. Ron Hoover's Church of Appliantology (he gave his last [cash] to some funky religious guy from 2 songs ago), learns to speak German, goes back into The Closet (a bar where men dress like housewives and speak foreign languages in order to pick up dancing appliances), goes to the apartment of an appliance that sort of looks like a magical pig with marital aids stuck all over it, gets off with the appliance and its roommate (a gay Bob doll), gets arrested (I can't say why here), goes to prison (where all the advertising executives take turns plooking each other), gets released, and ends up working at the Utility Kitchen putting the little green rosettas on the muffins.<BR>Who else but FZ can think this stuff up?<BR>Oh yeah, the music, of course, is pretty good too.
B00000064F|5.0|Nick Drake's &quot;Bryter Layter&quot; is an awesome CD, my favorite song on this CD is &quot;Fly&quot;.  I love this song it is soft, simple, light, and exceptionally mellow. It reminds me of water, because it is cool and crisp of extreme necessity. It drenches and washes the soul freeing and setting it free -- kind of like a fly.<br />I find this CD to be the best that I have ever heard. I love groups like Bread, Ambrosia, and Fleetwood Mac. Mr. Drake definitely had his on sound and nobody . . . I do not think that anyone could ever produce such lovely music as he did. I wish that he could have produced more. Either way what he left behind was indeed a legacy. <br />I am truly blessed by listening to such music that inspires the senses and the heart.  Mr. Drake's music is truly touching and soothing to the soul . . .
B00005U18E|1.0|Obviously there's no accounting for taste.  How and why so many people spoke well of this movie is very puzzling to me.  The story is [bad], beginning with the fact that the story-teller first convinces us how empty Bridget's life is, then has someone fall in love with her without identifying why and which qualities in her he admired, or even exist.<br />The story is thin, the acting weak.  I don't understand why the British were upset that an American actress played the lead role...

B00000JGOH|5.0|I loved this movie. I thought going into it that understanding Shakespeares' style and manner of speech would be difficult for me to understand, but not at all. Much credit has to go to the many talented and likeable actors who brought this story to life. On one level, this story describes (with the vital and enthusiastic endorsement of Queen Elizabeth) the very roots of show business and how troups of actors coalesced into an industry. But this movie at its heart is a good old-fashioned bittersweet love story with lots of laughs to lighten it up. Very loosely based of Shakespeare's early years as a writer/actor this story made clever use of at least a half dozen real persons who were a part of his world. That said, for some serious Shakespeare buffs to chaffe over variances with precise historical accuracy is to miss the point. Elizabethian times were not easy, certainly not very sanitary, and this film conveyed convincingly by way of costume and set design how daily life might have played out in 1593. Joseph Fiennes' Will Shakespeare was likeable, handsome, full of youthful energy and possessed of a boundless intellect. Gwyneth Paltrow positively glowed as the fictional Viola. In this role she had to at times act cross gender and in doing so demonstrated a remarkable range and talent, most deserving of the Academy Award she won. Geoffrey Rush, the superb Australian actor was brilliant as Philip Henslowe the fatalistic and comical theatre owner. (In real life, Henslowe married his way out of indentured service and was mentioned in Shakespeare's will). Noteworthy is Judi Dench's famous 8 minutes of screen time so believable as Queen Elizabeth that she won best supporting actress. This movie worked on so many levels that you are bound to find something to like about it. Easily one of the best romantic comedies, certainly one of the most novel ever filmed.

0446525537|5.0|I first read this book when my friend lent it to me about a year ago; I read it all at once and I cried for a half-an-hour after I finished it!  I almost stopped reading at the end of the first chapter because it seemed like all the book was was endless details about the town, people, etc.  I'm sooooooo glad I didn't because this is a book about the truest and purest love two people could have; however, it's not sicky sweet, either.  I finally saw the movie as well, (if I'd seen the movie first, I probably wouldn't have read the book) but it was hardly anything like the book (however, I still loved it because of Shane West------wow-type, hottie!).  I'm afraid that people won't read the book, now, because the movie was so goody sweet (I was almost gagging at the end--except for Mr. West:), but the book isn't like that at all and only gets a little mushy at the end, so READ THIS BOOK!  Have the hankies ready!

In my opinion this is a great book and i suggest everyone reads it

The 30 minutes of the attack in wonderful film making. The ending of the film is great too. I cried for the whole legth of the second DVD. The clothes and the locations are great. A lot of the movie hit close to home because of 9/11. Both women and men will like this movie. A good movie to watch on a rainy day.
B000002LCK|5.0|I got this CD as my first New Order CD and fell inlove with the hitas imediately.  Luckly, this CD also has much variety so I can always find something new to like as my tastes change.  At first, I thought the 2nd disc wasn't worth listening to except for 1963, but the first couple of tracks are hauntingly beautiful and very reminisent of Joy Division.  I'm not a big fan of the instrumentals on the 2nd disc, but the amazing 1st disc more than makes up for it.
0385484518|4.0|The book Tuesdays with Morrie was a pretty good book.  The author never really repeated the same information a whole lot.  This story teaches you a lot of life's lessons and it keeps you interested from the beginning.  Over all I consider it one of the  better books that I've read in a really long time, but that's probably because I don't read much.  It's a true life story that everybody can relate to in some sense

This album as well as &quot;Light Years&quot; is excellent.  There isn't a single bad track on this album and it is absolutely killer.  Great dance/pop music that is what is it - pure enjoyable pop at it's best. Get this album and let Kylie enjoy the same &quot;re-discovery&quot; that Cher and Madonna have been enjoying for years.

0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond does an excellent job of setting out some reasons behind how different areas developed. For instance why it was people from Eurasia that came to dominate the Americas, and not vice versa. [Essentially more favourable geography and availability of domesticatible plants and animals - and the associated diseases from those domestic animals].<br />I found this book thought provoking and it had many elements which were new for me.  In addition, it is written in an engaging manner, which I enjoyed.<br />It does not consider the impact of societal structure or culture, and cannot therefore explain why it was Western Europe rather than other Eurasian centres such as the Middle East, India or China that came to dominate the world. I would recommend other books (especially Paul Kennedy's Rise and Fall of the Great Powers) for post-1500 developments.<br />Nevertheless I would rate this as one of my top books and would recommend it to anyone with a general interest in history.
0385484518|5.0|I believe that the book showed a lot of actions that happen in everyday life for everyone. I think that his lessons were well taught and that it is sad how he had to end the lessons and he should be remembered for having a well loved heart.
B000001EL3|5.0|This album was what got me into hard rock... Almost every song on<br />this is fab!!!! It contains some of the greatest songs KISS ever<br />did, tho' producer BOB EZRIN had a hand in writing 7 of the al-<br />bum's 9 songs. The orchestral arrangements, the choir and the<br />keyboards add to the group's sound instead of detract from it.<br />( I didn't realize BOB EZRIN borrowed the main guitar riff from<br />GREAT EXPECTATIONS from BEETHOVEN until I watched the<br />movie THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE!)This album also featured PAUL<br />STANLEY'S best singing up to that point, especially on FLAMING<br />YOUTH and KING OF THE NIGHTTIME WORLD, where his voice had never<br />sounded so strong and powerful. It also features some nifty gui-<br />tar playing, particularly on DETROIT ROCK CITY. The guitar solo<br />for that song is phenomenal, in ACE's and PAUL's selection of<br />notes. PETER CRISS, too, does some of his best drumming on this<br />song. GOD OF THUNDER was probably the scariest thing KISS ever<br />wrote up to that point, with it's heavy guitar riff, pounding drums,SIMMON's MONSTER VOCALS and the eerie sound effects,<br />( and BOB EZRIN's kids running around in space helmets, sounding<br />like little munchkins!)In some ways, it's kind of funny, also!GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a great song, with<br />the orchestral arrangements, choir and SIMMON's almost sweet<br />sounding vocals being in complete contrast with his naughty ly-<br />rics! FLAMING YOUTH is a hard rock classic, as is SWEET PAIN and<br />the very catchy SHOUT IT OUT LOUD. And, of course, we can't for-<br />get about BETH, which was CRISS's first song contribution to the<br />band(tho' he had alot of help writing it!) It became a HUGE HIT<br />for KISS and deservedly so, for it really IS a great little<br />ballad.<br /> DESTROYER is one of the best hard rock( or dare I say and I do<br />dare), PROGRESSIVE hard rock albums of the 70's and one of the best<br />KISS albums ever!
0385484518|4.0|This book is great... for an older person, but for anyone under the age of twenty its a real bore.  The content of the book is all about learning life's lessons and learning to live life to the fullest.  It is really not a subject most teens care to read about because most of us are still out partying and doing whatever.  However the book does make you think about where your life is headed.  In me it raised the question of whether or not my life will pan out the I feel it should, and when time runs down on my life and I finally die will I be satisfied with what I've accomplished.  All in all this book is good, but I feel it is geared more toward older adult taste.
B000059MEK|5.0|I just wanna say that if i could just bring one album on a desert island it would be the one for me to bring , a solid one ,you can listen it after a year and not get saturated of this one . it's a five star for me .
0385484518|5.0|My english teacher opened my eyes when he decided for us to read Tuesdays with Morrie. Every since the first page, this book has been a life lesson. By reading this you learn that life can be a wonderful experience. You can answer simple questions like &quot;Am I living how I should be?&quot; This book is definitely a wonderful experience. You should read this book, if not for entertainment then for the education of life.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I think this album is a really good one ! I bought dig your on hole in 97 and didn't like some song after that i heard hey boy hey girl and out of control and got in love with this classic song from them , after hearing this album i bought it and since the last 2 weeks i can'not live without it , with songs like it began in afrika and star guitar you can'not like this album ! the best one yiet for me .
B000002C4J|5.0|Let's Talk About Love is a wonderful album, the theme for this album is Love, that's why the title is Let's Talk About Love:)! Anyways... this album has some great songs on here to listen to, for example like Immortality, Treat Her like A Lady, To Love You More, Miles To Go Before I Sleep, and of course the title track! My favorite songs are Immortality, Treat Her Like A Lady, My Heart will go on, where is the love, miles to go (before I sleep) and to love you more. This album is worth every red cent, please buy it.
6305014140|5.0|This is a must have for any one who likes or know some one who likes anime. It has the ultimate protaganist, Jubei, who not only talks ... with the best of them, but deals out the craziest techniques in martial arts. The villians are also great, they are all different, all very cool, and all put up a hell of a fight. This movie is the definitive anime, don't get me wrong, Akira is pretty great, but it can't squash the replay value of this movie nor can it repress how classic this film is. >Peace
B00005A46T|1.0|i didnt like slipknots first, and this one [stinks] even more.  these songs are jut 2 power chords and repetitive screaming.  who wants to listen to that? its a heavier, [a worse] breed of nu-metal. for real metal, check out early metallica, and the new opeth album, iron maide, judas priest, etc..
B00005N9CV|5.0|When I first heard DK it was on a download from AOL. Despite her Grammy in 1999, I had never heard of her. And here I am into music and Jazz but from the Older school. I knew I had something good when the first track started. Talk about feeling and timing and the voice itself----not in a long time for me. I knew Julie London and she would have been pleased to hear DK's version of &quot;Cry Me A River&quot; what a tribute. I now own two of her albums and will own them all soon......That says it all...
0393312836|5.0|Since there are hundreds of other reviews, I'll keep mine brief. This book really makes you think. Even if you didn't enjoy the movie (I personally thought it was rather dull), this book may surprise you. I think it blows the movie out of the water. The made-up language that Alex uses may be confusing at first, but through context you can usually learn what it means and your mind will immediately register &quot;droogs&quot; as friends.
0446678430|2.0|If you have seen the new infomercials Robert Kiyosaki has made about retiring and making millions of dollars, you get the gist of this book.  It is a three hundred and thirty five page ad for all of his other products under his Rich Dad moniker.<br />Most frustrating is Kiyosaki's complete lack of skills as a writer.  He freely admits he is not a great writer, and proceeds to prove it.  He repeats himself constantly throughout the book, and writes pages of dialogue scenes he swears are from memory, but play like the worst staged scenes in an infomercial.<br />Kiyosaki also manipulates the reader with his constant berating.  If you are doubtful of his methods or if you question whether you can go running out and buying real estate without money down, then that is your problem.  You are wrong and he is right.  I was consistently made to feel stupid as I read this thing, and that was confirmed by the authors' smug attitude toward people who actually work for a living.<br />Kiyosaki also never gets specific about how to retire young and rich.  He dances around the subject, throwing out little helpful hints here and there, but never gets to the brass tacks when it comes to sitting down and doing it.  Recommending I go to seminars and hire a bookkeeper are lovely ideas...but then what??<br />If anyone is retiring young and rich, it is the people behind this three hundred page ad for other Rich Dad products.  If anything, reading this will inspire you to go it on your own, and ignore the advice of &quot;experts&quot; like this duo.  Don't waste your money, or self esteem.
0061040967|4.0|It's not Pratchett at his best, or even at his averagest... In places, it's almost not Pratchett at all. The story limps along like a wounded dinosaur, sometimes struggling to remind the reader what's going on. I admit to dozing off several times -  unlike other Terry Pratchett stuff, which usually has me howling on the floor.<br />In recompense, Paul Kidby's illustrations are superb and they alone make this book worth buying. As one reviewer pointed out, there's a rapport between Discworld readers and the characters and, even allowing for a less-well-told story, that rapport is guarded by the visual descriptions.<br />Grat pictures... pity about the plot.
0812550706|5.0|They say that this is the sci fi book for people who don't like science fiction.  There's a reason for this.<br />This book, like anything else by Orson Scott Card, is character-based, instead of plot-based like most speculative fiction.  This means that it is intensely interesting.  The characters are realistic.  They feel things like you and I.  They are each influenced by many things which shape their descisions.<br />Ender's Game, incidently, is used by the marines.  They study to learn about leadership.<br />Born in a family with a genius brother and sister, Ender (Andrew) Wiggins is also a child genius.  But his spirit, originality, and good soul make him the prime candidate for Battle School, a government space station school for gifted kids who are potential military commanders.  This is vital because Earth has been invaded by the alien buggers.<br />There is an epic sense to the book, though it never loses touch with the real issues, the ones inside the character's heads.  There is much more to this book than can be explained by the simple plot.<br />It is like Survivor meets ET meets Wizard's Hall meets the history of our planet Earth.<br />Great Stuff.
B00005R23X|5.0|BS's Dracula is the most ambitious project of Francis Coppola since Apocalypse now. Ambitious project doesn't mean succesful, so this film wasn't a succes nor for the critics nor for the audiences, but it split them both. I think it's worth seeing because it's a great creative effort and if sometimes it can seem overdirected, the cinematography, the costums and the locations are wonderful. Winona Ryder is good, while Tom Waits makes an impressive performance playing a minor role.<BR>The Superbit DVD looks good but not so good as other titles in this series, maybe it all depends that the movie is of 1992, so isn't quite recent, however the video track is good and pleasing: an important result when you consider the extreme differences of lights the movie presents. Between the 2 audio tracks I prefer the DTS track, surround effects are rare, but musical surround is highly involving, while dialogues are beautifully rendered.
B00005QK3W|4.0|Hey, all:<br />Before you dump this CD, listen to it again! Though this might not be &quot;Band on the Run&quot; or even &quot;Venus and Mars,&quot; Paul does really well with some of this music. His driving bass and thoughtful lyrics really drive this CD. My faves are &quot;From a Lover to a Friend,&quot; &quot;She's Not Talking&quot; and &quot;Your Loving Flame.&quot; The lyrics to &quot;Flame&quot; are really wonderful. &quot;When we kissed, I'll never be the same. I could spend eternity inside your loving flame.&quot;<br />OK, maybe it sounds corny to some, but the music is beautiful, too. &quot;Freedom&quot; is the anthem at the end, that will leave you stomping your feet, and the title track has a lot of interesting guitar work, especially at the beginning. Not quite as accessible as &quot;Flaming Pie,&quot; but I'm sure he missed Linda's help as muse. Interesting that the song about his new flame, &quot;Heather,&quot; has no words at all. Wonder what that says.<br />To quote Lennon, All I am saying is give Paul a chance.
0767830555|5.0|This is one of the basic films of the last quarter of the 20th century and this DVD offers a good chance to own it in a version remastered both in audio and video under the control of Scorsese in person!!<BR>Audio and video tracks are both pleasing. The images are faithful to the movie experience, while the DS audio track is more effective and involving than many DD tracks we're used listenin' to.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|In all probability one should not complain to much about films which are not very realistic. The idea of a film is someting which is meant to entertain regardless of whether it says much about life or in fact anything. <br />During the Second World War the Germans used a machine to generate their codes. The machine was called Enigma. The British had purchased a copy of one of these machines from some Polish agents early in the war. The film is based on an incident in which a British trawler forced a German U Boat to surrender. They were able to capture the German book of settings for the machine and also some of the rotor wheels. <br />This break through was of importance as it enabled the British to dimply direct convoys around the German boats. (The German boats gave position reports to their high command on a regular basis) It significantly cut down the losses of merchant boats for a while. <br />British viewers are no doubt annoyed that this exploit of a trawler captain has become a special covert operation run by the Americans. Other viewers will be annoyed by the complete failure to look at anything to do with how U Boats actually operated at the time. In recent years submarines have had torpedoes which have homing devices and as a result torpedoes can be fired at submerged submarines. In the Second World War this simply was not possible. To have combat occur in a way which was impossible grates. <br />If one can however free oneself from reality the film is a reasonably well paced piece of hokum and is easy to watch.
B00005U18E|2.0|having watched this film recently i was told that Zellweger was doing a British Accent&that alone got my attention.first of all just like Hugh Grant I Find Him&Her 3rd Tier Actors.neither too me can carry a film&this is living proof.this film has some ok moments but the cliche Songs that Pump up Zellweger makes this film another Average film at best.it just didn't really move me.
B00005JKYS|4.0|The best Vietnam war film I've seen.  Deals with the first American engagement with the Vietnamese.  This movie just never stops after getting to Vietnam.  <br />Gives people a whole new respect for the soldiers who laid it on the line for their country. No politics, no social statement, just American Heroes fighting an enemy with honor and bravery.  Sam Elliot was fantastic and Mel Gibson was a pleasant surprise.<br />Bravo!  At last a movie that shows the vietnam war vets as the heros they were.
0783225881|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies.  And, it showcases Iowa at its finest!  I enjoy watching this movie in February, when the ground is white with snow, and spring seems a lifetime away.  The lush green cornfields and grasses in this movie remind me of the beauty of Iowa in the spring and summer.<BR>This is the story of Ray Kinsella, a man haunted by the words he never said to his father.  On a sunny afternoon, walking through his cornfields, a voice tells him, \\"If you build it, He will come.\\"  These six words lead Ray on a journey of epic proportions, as he seeks to find what he's supposed to build, and for whom he is to build it.<BR>This is not just a story about baseball.  It's about dreams coming true, about love, and about hope.  There is magic that seems so very real, so real that you wish for it to be true.<BR>And as a proud citizen of the state of Iowa, it is a stunning view of what lush green beauty exists in this wonderful state.  Yea, there is a bit of heaven here.
6304698526|5.0|Bullitt is one of Steve McQueen's best movies ever.<br />McQueen plays a San Francisco police officer assigned to protect a mob informer prior to testimony.  When the man is killed while in police custody, He smells a major league rat.  When he further learns the man they were guarding wasn't even the right guy to begin with, it really hits the fan.<br />The film features a first rate suspense story.  It also features two of the most famous \\"chase\\" scenes in film history, a car chase through the streets of San Francisco and a one-on-one chase at San Francisco international airport.<br />The supporting cast is absolutely terrific.  The acting is excellent.  Although there is very little actual violence, what's there has tremendous impact. This is a movie that grabs your imagination while simultaneously kicking you in the gut.<br />There is one major flaw-the love interest between McQueen and Jacqueline Bisset is truly pathetic.  It sticks out like a toilet bowl in a field of wildflowers and adds not one darn thing to the plot.  There is no chemistry between the two whatsoever.  Fortunately, it is a very minor part of the film and is easily overlooked.<br /> This is classic McQueen, and any fan of the suspense genre cannot afford to miss this movie.
B000002X0Z|5.0|Since Mobb Deep dropped The Infamous, which many people regard as one of the top rap albums ever, people thought that they couldn't match it. But the Mobb did the inevetable and dropped Hell On Earth, which is even more dark and grimey than their classic lp. Hell On Earth is not The Infamous, but it comes pretty close and is still a hardcore hip-hop classic. Cuts like 'G.O.D Pt.III', 'Hell On Earth (Front Lines)', 'Drop A Gem On Em' and 'Get Dealt With' are some of the best rap songs you'll ever hear. You should also hear 'Apostle's Warning', where Prodigy goes wild, and 'Extortion' where they rip it up with Method Man. This is one of the best albums ever, and definately one of the best Mobb Deep has ever done. If you are a fan of real hip-hop, you should own this without a doubt.
B00003CXXP|5.0|While time continues to move forward, this movie will only gain in stature. I was amazed at the poor or neutral reviews when the movie came out and thought that the movie going public is not given enough credit for being able to handle a movie that addresses so many current and topical issues; family life, technology, cloning, the environment. It is not a movie for those that are looking for some down time. This is a serious movie with a message that seems more relevent with each passing day. It deserves to do better as a rental or purchased DVD than it did in the theaters last summer. I'd stronly recommend this movie to anyone.
B000002B1M|5.0|Now being that Nas has all five album out.  I feel that all of his albums are classics from Illmatic to Stillmatic I love all of them.  He has always brough something good to the plate. No matter if he's going through balttes or people just don't like what he's about he has always came up on the top in my eyes. So as a number i fan. All his albums are hot. Keep doing what your doing Nas.<BR>1 Love
0800177177|1.0|I did not like this movie. I read the book and loved it. When I saw the movie I saw that it followed non of the books story line. The movie was titled Bram Stoker's Dracula yet the movie portrays the characters and their personalities all wrong. They even add things that are not in the book, such as the love affair between Mina Harker and her &quot;Prince,&quot; in the book she depised the Count, in the movie she couldn't get enough of him. So in short it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed in the movie.
0446525537|4.0|A walk to remember seems to be one of those heart touching love stories, where everything seems to fall in place in the end of the book. However, when you start reading it and finish it you will be guaranteed touched by this story that Nicholas Sparks wrote. Some parts of the story people can really relate to and other parts are just unexpected. <BR>Landon Carter recalls his best summer ever in his life back in 1958 when he was 17. His character is just like any other young teenage guy, one who wishes to be popular and a jock and have all the cheerleaders line up after them. However, Landon does not play on the school football team, nor does he have cheerleaders line up after him. Instead during his senior year Landon decided to run for student body president and also join the school drama. Through this period of drama classes and other social activities, he meets the most unexpected girl ever. The town bishops daughter Jamie, she teaches Landon so many things about life. Which allowed him to not just fall in love with her, but to realize the things that are important in life that he had been ignoring all this time. Through all these fun times they have, Jamie spills the big problem and Landons whole world falls apart. <BR>The whole situation with Jamies big problem resulted to a lot of sympathy amongst the townspeople. Through this Nicholas Sparks tries to tell us that we should cherish every moment in life. Dont wait till the last minute till you realize youve wasted some, you should think that every moment in your life is something special and shouldnt be forgotten. <BR>I really enjoyed this book; I read it in one day. I usually dont read books nor do I read them in one day! So I was really surprised that I was so into it that I finished it in one day. Even though a lot of the commentaries say that the book will make you ball when youre done reading. I didnt although I found it very touching. Its a little to good to be true. After reading thisbook, I really wish the movie were out in Taiwan so I can watch it. I think Im going to go buy some other books written by Nicholas Sparks, I like the way he write his books. Its realistic and yet many parts are unexpected!
067144901X|5.0|I recently borrowed 'Moo, Baa, LA, LA' from our local library, and I wish my daughter had a copy of her own.  I thoroughly enjoy reading Ms. Boynton's books.  The pictures and easy text keep a little one's attention.  With \\"Moo, Baa, LA, LA, LA\\" the fun just continues.  These are wonderful books for wee ones (daughter is 1 year) and Mom and Dad have fun reading them.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I'm thrilled that after 20 years, this album still does it for me.  Other Clash albums may have sold more, or had better reviews, but this is the masterpiece that occupies most of my listening time.  What they took on in putting this together had to be overwhelming, but they pulled it off with astonishing variety.  The number of musical styles that all work show that it was a dark day for rock when this band broke up.  And maybe you don't agree with the politics, but here was a band that really did say something.  You can listen to it a dozen times and still pull lots out of it.  Definately one of my top five of all time, and maybe number one.
B000002UAI|2.0|This is [bad] by Beatles standards.  They didn't really get good until Revolver...then they got really good...but this is just quite average.  Even for the Beatles.
6303369170|1.0|First of all, let me establish that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan.  Alright? Okay then...next, this movie was one of a kind in that it was so unbearable to watch that I became sick of life and tried to hang myself with pantihose as was done in the film.  This movie made me so sick of television, that I can no longer bear to watch it.  What are you people talking about saying this was a good movie?? What the Hell?  Not a good movie...what were they thinking and what the hell is up with those eskimos?
B000002J09|4.0|The songs on Zeppelin IV are incredible, but there's only 8.  Besides Four Sticks, all of them are up there with the best songs of all time, but is it worth spending [item price] on a CD that only has 8 songs?  Get an anthology, they all have the good songs from Zeppelin IV on them.
6305428298|5.0|My wife, daughter and I just watched this and loved it.<br />We were amazed to see at the end that Jane Horrocks actually did her own singing.  Amazing!<br />This was a sweet story.  Michael Caine was fantastic giving what was probably his most &quot;real&quot; performance.  And Ewan McGregor was great in a surprisingly timid role as a shy suitor.<br />We also laughed quite a bit at the great subtle humor in the film.  Keep a lookout for the scene where the old couple dressed like indians prepare to go on stage with their knife throwing act.
B00005QIPH|5.0|If you like catchy guitar tunes that you'll be singing for days, you should buy this. Who cares what they wore on MTV yesterday? I hummed the tunes on this album more often than any other I bought or heard last year.<br />People who don't like it seem to care most that they're ripping off Television, the Velvets, or the Smiths. Well, when's the new Velvet Underground album coming out? I'll sing along with the Strokes til then.
0786867973|2.0|I wanted this cookbook from the minute I saw it. The writing is great and the pictures are beautiful and inspiring. I placed it high on my Christmas wish list, and was lucky enough (or so I thoght)to receive it.<BR>Looking for a cake to bake for my daughter-in-laws birthday, I came upon the butterscotch layer cake.It looked so good that I had to try it.<BR>I followed the recipe to the letter, even using the food processor as she had suggested. I placed it in the oven to bake and watched as the cake failed to rise even a quarter of an inch. So it was a second trip to the grocery store, and after re-reading the recipe and the substitutions ( re: self rising cake flour vs all purpose self rising flour) I gave it another shot, using the all purpose flour instead of the cake flour and using my mixer and following the method for the victoria sponge, as she suggests in the recipe itself.<BR>Into the oven again, and as I made the frosting I watched...as the cake again went nowhere. Maybe it isn't supposed to rise,I thought, so I cooled it and assembled it. It looked beautiful, and it tasted like..well for lack of a nicer word ..cardboard, and had the consistency of a brick with caramel poured over it. So, a whole Saturday spent, with nothing to show for it except a a heavy garbage bag. ( which is where the cake went ) The frosting was not even that good. Does anyone know if there were some ingredients left out in the printing of this recipe? I am not a novice as far as the kitchen goes, so this not coming out has been a frustrating experience for me.<BR>I may give another recipe a try, but for the meantime I'll stick with my Gale Grand.
B000002UEB|5.0|There are certain Albums that grace us all and when he hear em we know that we have just heard a classic. Well, not only is Operation Midcrime a classic, I can still remember the day I first heard it. I had already been a Queensryche fan and it has been over two years since the last album and finally after all the waiting it was coming out. BUT KNAC in Long Beach California (a Metal Station) Had a copy before release and instead of just playing one song they decided to play the whole album, well I was driving home from work and it was mid day and BAM! I was struck, the Whole album is just fantastic. I can't say there are highlights, cause every song is great. This is a must have for every Hard Rock and Metal fan and is one of rock n roll's all time great albums.
068484267X|4.0|McCourt's hellish surroundings and bright spirit continually play off each other in a tension that keeps you turning the pages.  Will his childlike faith in God carry him through his next defeat? Will he succumb to the misery? It is certainly not a book for the weak in spirit. I was tempted to lay it down because of the sheer multitude of extreme situations, especially in regard to his father, but I kept reading - out of my own sense of hope I guess.  I found most of the book to be believable, except for his sexual experiences.  These seemed to be more personally redemptive and fantasy oriented than realistic. It made me question his character and pity him somewhat; Whereas before I strongly admired him and applauded his painstaking honesty and depth.  Because of this incongruence, I gave the book a 4 rather than a 5.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Deep Purple was and is a great band I love all the incarnations of Deep Purple, but Mark Two R. Blackmore, J. Lord, I. Pace, R. Gover and I. Gillian was and is the most popular version and did there most memorable songs (Smoke On The Water, Highway Star, Child In Time, Lazy, Space Truckin,' etc.,). Made in Japan was one of those albums everyone had in the 70,s along with Frampton Comes Alive, We're An American Band, Led Zeppelin 4 , etc., And this version with bonus tracks is great, its sounds great the mastering is perfect, and the bonus track are cool.  This is a must have for any Deep Purple fan and a must have for any Hard Rock Fan.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade is one of the most talented recording artists that exist today and on this live album she is nothing less than perfection. She performs some of her new songs blended with some of her classics, but the best parts come when Sade speaks to the audience. Sade provides a glimpse into her personality when she speaks. Buy the album now, it's amazing.
B00000DGRX|5.0|Deep Purple Machine Head is an absolutely fabulous album containing the smash hit Deep Purple songs, Smoke On The Water, Highway Star, Lazy, and Space Trukin.' This is a must have album for any hard rock fan and now its even better as a remastered CD. Disk One is the whole album remastered with 24 bit technology Smoke On The Water, Highway Star, Lazy, and Space Trukin, Maybe I'm A Leo, Never Before and Pictures of Home along (songs out of order in my review) Three bonus tracks; When A Blind Man Cry's (a B side), Maybe I'm A Leo and Lazy both Quadraphonic mixes. Disk 2 is all the original songs Smoke On The Water, Highway Star, Lazy, and Space Trukin, Maybe I'm A Leo, Never Before and Pictures of Home from machine head and the B side When A Blind Mans Cry's all remixed with different emphasis, for instance there are different Guitar and keyboard parts on many of the songs; Disk 2 is very very cool. The booklet is informative as well. Cool Pictures and a nice slip case for the Jewell case.
0385484518|3.0|Tuesdays with morrie was a really good book but, its not a book i would suggets for teenagers. This is a book for adults in their mid to late thirties. Most teenagers are worried about the party on the coming up weekend not the meaning of their life and death and who they are going to marry when they get older. the book was really good and you can learn alot from morrie but it just was not a book i really cared for.
B00000I0XW|4.0|Sarah Brightman sings the Andrew Lloyd Webber collection--this CD left me agape! I am not a die-hard fans of Sarah Brightman but I began to look for her CDs after hearing the duet with Andrea Bocelli \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\". Her pure soprano voice is addictive that will only make you want more and more of her tunes. This compilation is pretty much like a salute to Andrew Lloyd Webber's modern musical work. The selection comprises of some of the most well-known and beautiful tunes we've heard from Webber's musicals. The most popular by far is probably The Phantom of the Opera. The title song Track 01-The Phantom of the Opera and the heart-warming Track 16-The Music of the Night begins and ends the album very appropriately. Other Phantom songs were also woven into this compilation like Track 04-All I Ask of You and the heart-breaking Track 14-Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again. <br />While I always crowed about The Phantom of the Opera...the real draw in this compilation are songs we seldom or never heard Brightman perform. Track 05-Don't Cry for Me Argentina is beautifully performed with Brightman's pure but deep soprano voice. The song Webber for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics Game, Track 08-Amigos Por Simpre (Friends for Life) is a duet with Jose Carreras. This song is one of the reasons I purchased this CD. Another highlight would be the beautiful song Track 13-Tell Me on a Sunday. An interesting pick would be Track 06-Another Suitcase in Another Hall, Srah Brightman's performance is very cute yet still solid. From Cats, Track 09-Memory is another of my personal pick. Loud and upbeat choice would be Track 11-Macavity, also from Cats. The compilation also records from \\"Requiem\\", Track 15-Pie Jesus. Andrew Lloyd Webber is my most favorite musical composer and is the first whom I come to acknowledge. For those who are fans of Webber and those who love musicals as much as I do, I strongly recommend this CD. The songs are so beautiful and moving that will touch your soul and make you leave the music on and on. The only flipside (I hate to say this) is that this CD would be a perfection if the recording quality is done better (thus take out a star). But no big deal.
0395489326|5.0|J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is a timeless classic, and the foundation on which all modern fantasy is built(we would have no Star Wars, Ultima, or Everquest without it just to name the popular).  However, its roots lie in the oldest of tales like Beowolf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.  Tolkien's gift is the ability to take these age old myths and stories and combine them into what is a truly stellar work of art that decades after its release still captivates the readers imagination.  I believe it is one of the most important works of literature written in the 20th Century.
B00005UEAR|1.0|First of all I am a fan. I own all Dream Theater CDs and I thought up to this point they were infallable. This new CD sounds like a cross between a dirge and a Manheim Steamroller tribute band. Not a single cut on the two CDs was worth the time to listen. Occasional signs of brilliance led me on to no avail. Ultimate disappointment.
0783240287|5.0|I absolutely loved this musical.  I only fell asleep once (just kidding).  The thing I liked about it is that the songs are very easy to remember and sing.  After just hearing it once I was walking around singing some of the songs.  Don't be put off because it's a Bible story, it doesn't really have much to do with the Bible and was a great story!<br />Also, I didn't really like Cats so if you don't either don't exclude Joseph just because of Cats!
B00005V9QJ|1.0|The whole point of seeing an artist live is to go beyond the studio recording.  If you want to hear it exactly as it is on the CD, then just stay at home and listen to the CD.  I was very disappointed to hear very little that was new or different from the original recordings.  Plus, the crowd noise does seem excessive.  I could have done without this one.
0060934719|5.0|This is one of those rare stories that will become a true classic.  An enchanting fairytale woven through with mystery and magic.  This book sticks with you long after its finished.  I can't wait until my niece is old enough to start being read to from this book.  I hope it will become one of her favorites.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Catchy, memorable and above all witty, Merrit's songs are amazing.  Listening to them, I wish that I had just been dumped so i could sit alone in my room crying with my headphones on and enjoy the music fully. Unfortunally I can only listen with a content ear. If you can only buy one volume,perhaps for monitary or health reasons, buy the first, it is the most consistant.  Otherwise just buy the whole thing, put it on the old stereo and pretend to be heart broken.
B00005YW4H|5.0|There is an honesty and purity to Norah Jones that can be heard throughout this incredible album.  Her vocals are so tender, yet drenched with emotion and each song sounds like her very own, even though only three of them actually are.  Norah and her band are a very much needed breath of fresh air to the music world.  It is an entire band effort however, I especially enjoy how the album is wrapped up nice and neat with just Norah and her piano on &quot;The Nearness of You.&quot;  If you want an album that speaks to every emotion, that brings the artist to the forefront (rather than an image)and doesn't swim in over-production then this album should definitely be included in your collection.  You won't be disappointed.  Already my pick for Album of the Year!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have to admit, I didn't like the previews when I saw Moulin Rouge. But once I did see the movie, I was totally taken by force, by the spectacular singing and the great acting of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor-both are profound singers, and I love all of the songs on this album-they're so passionate. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you should. It's up for 6 nominations at the Oscars, and I hope they win them all!
B000002IST|5.0|I am a major big fan of Phil Collins and I love Genesis.  I didnt like the two previously albums of them, but this one is a true masterpiece.  You have great rock songs &quot;No son of mine&quot; &quot;Jesus he knows me&quot; and beautiful ballad &quot;Hold on my heart&quot;.  But the song that stands out both for it deep lyricially message and musicially is &quot;Driving the last spike&quot; which is my al time fave Genesis song.  The song was written and dedicated to al of those young soliders that have to go to war, and basicially it covers al the feelings they had when they were there, REALLY POWERFULL AND EMOTIONAL MASTERPIEACE!  It is long 10 min but al of it is awesome.  The title track is good, but not really in my cup of tea.  To al of those who say that Genesis sold out just because they dont do prog rock anymore, get over it folks.  Genesis was probably tired of prog rock(And I cant blame them, I hate most prog rock) and wanted to do something new, not to get more money.  If that was true they wouldnt make such long tracks.  &quot;Dreaming while you sleep&quot; is another great track.  Overall this is a must for any Genesis, or and Phil Collins fans, it cant get any better then this cd for Genesis.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Tron was quite ahead of its time, the first movie to use the CGI effects to any real extent.  In effect, it was really a showpiece for the new technology, something you might see at a tech convention to wow potential buyers.  Though the acting is poor, Tron manages to give the veiwer a glimpse into what it was like 'way back when' when the computer age was being born.  <br />The DVD is an excellent transfer.  Those of you who have seen Tron on TV as a Saturday afternoon special on an obscure cable channel are in for a treat.  The film looks crisp and colors are sharp, and the additional documentary on how it was made is an interesting diversion.  A nice addition to your DVD collection.
B00005QIPH|5.0|What can I say about the Strokes that hasnt already been said.  Quite frankly, they are rock's saviors.  Julian Casablanca is rock's most charismatic frontman since Liam Gallagher.  Everything about the Strokes epitimizes what rock n roll SHOULD be.  &quot;Last Night&quot; was hands down the best single of 2001-that can not even be argued.  The entire album is fantastic.  &quot;Is This It&quot; starts the album off beautifully with a slower tempo song, then things pick up with &quot;The Modern Age&quot; and dont stop till the album climaxes with the powerful &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;.  This album is the best debut album since Oasis &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and is easily the best rock record of the new millenium.  Obviously, this CD is well worth your money.
0451204530|5.0|With the fantastic premise promised on the back cover, it would have been easy to underdeliver on the potential that it offered, by Mr Follet delivered to the expectations.  The plot was good.  Character development was good.  I especially appreciated the jumping timeline that allowed the reader to gain an appreciation for the undercurents of the characters' motives, while maintaining suspense in two separate timelines.  As a younger reader, I also appreciated the 1940-1957 setting that gave me a unique glimpse into a time that I know only through traditional WWII and early Cold War media.
B00005Y228|5.0|I've been a fan of Kylie's for many years going back to the 80's with her first album, but as America's shine to her dissipated it was difficult to keep track of her.  This album was released in Canada last year and I haven't put it down since and I was waiting for her American release so she can finally get the exposure she deserves!  Well she has returned in top pop form (after a foray into indie) and this album shows that this is where she belongs.  While I admit the songs may sound alike, I have to say that sometimes I just want to listen to an album that makes me happy and keeps my spirits up!  &quot;Can't Get You Out of my Head&quot; is an amazing single, but it's not the only song to shine, other great songs include &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot; (a little slower beat, but a hummable song non-the-less), &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; (her new single) and &quot;Dancefloor&quot; (it will transport you there!).  If you remember Kylie from her early days, or if you're a lover of pure pop, then you definitely have to pick up this album.  I guarantee it will stay in your CD player for a long time!
B000059TPN|4.0|I waited for a long time to own The Rock in DVD, but I wanted an edition to do justice to the film. The Criterion edition comes close to what I expect of a special DVD edition, but it came a little short.<br />The sound is excellent, and the movie is a pleasure to hear, but the image is not as good, in some scenes one can look that it is a little bit grainy, I don't know what happened in the restoration process, but it certainly came short.<br />About the bonus material, they're just good. And one thing this edition lacks of is spanish subtitles, why is that important? Well, there's an important spanish-speaking community in the US and a growing one in Canada that would appreciate that! (and that goes for most of the Region 1 coded DVD's) and there are no criterion edition DVD's in Region 4 format.<br />The film is one of the best I've seen so far, it's an action rollercoaster and even when it is not very original in some parts and uses some clichés, it is an excellent movie to watch over and over.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Both Jagged Little Pill and Under Rug Swept are great.  However, I rate Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie as the best of the three.  While I don't praise all 17 tracks equally, this record is astounding in its musical creativity and emotional impact.  I simply cannot imagine songs better than Joining You, So Pure, and That I Would Be Good.  There is no artist better at matching meaningful lyrics with great sound.
B00005V9QJ|3.0|I hesitate to echo the comments of others too blatantly, but the crowd noise in the sound mix on this CD is simply too harsh and too loud.  The pleasures of listening to a Sade CD include the serene, sensual mood she creates with that languid voice.  It's difficult to have your senses heightened by the chanteuse's singular style when each song ends with an audience cacophony including the sounds of a couple of guys who watched \\"Arsenio\\" way too often.   Their infantile and out-of-place \\"HOO HOO HOO\\" chants follow every song, and amazingly are clearly audible over the rest of the audience cheers.  Sade's songs increase my blood-pressure in a lot of ways, but I can't imagine wanting to go Animal House after hearing her perform \\"Cherish the Day.\\"  Certainly this is a live CD, and it's appropriate to allow the listener to know how much the audience appreciated Sade's work throughout the show, but a little subtlety in the mix would have been advisable.  (In the alternative, my guess is that many of my fellow Sade fans would have preferred a recording in a more intimate club setting, where presumably the smaller audience wouldn't have felt compelled to act as if they were at a KISS concert.)<br />Most of these performances don't stray too much from the original studio versions, although the rise and fall of the passionate \\"Is It a Crime?\\" is accentuated in the live setting, and \\"Paradise\\" is given a funky and appealing coda.  The band is tight and competent, but it's clear that the star of this show is the gutteral, sexy voice of the singer.  She has limited range, but what a delivery.  <br />As some of the other reviews suggest, it's likely that if you are already a worshiper of Sade Adu, you won't be disappointed in hearing her perform unadorned versions of familiar songs to the cheers of her fans.  Casual listeners who haven't yet bought one of her CD's, however, shouldn't necessarily buy this one hoping for a greatest hits compilation.  As has been pointed out, this CD focuses primarily on her more recent work.  Sade hasn't changed the tone of her music over the years; but she has shrewdly updated the sound on each studio CD, all of which are worth the investment.  Certainly if you're a slave to trends in musical styles, you'll be happier with one of her more recent CDs.<br />If, however, you'd like Sade at her most rhythmic, you'd be better off buying \\"Stronger than Pride\\".  To bask in the glow of her sultry voice, try \\"Promise\\".  To hear her at her most vulnerable: \\"Diamond Life\\".  There's a theme developing here:  As good as Sade remains today, her smooth professionalism has been honed to the point that all sponteneity is lost.  Her earlier CDs have a freshness and easy grace that she hasn't been able to match lately.  That being said, there's a moment near the end of \\"Is It a Crime?\\" on \\"Lovers Live\\" where she tests the limits of her voice, and the range gets past her.  Strangely enough, it's the most engaging moment on this CD.
B00005QDW1|4.0|You can tell that they didn't record this in a normal studio. Not a bad CD, it's got a lot of singable songs, and a few really artistic ones too. A nice departure from their usual style, while still staying true.
0679735909|5.0|How does one begin to describe a book as gorgeous as &quot;Possession?&quot;  Are there really words to describe the words?<br />&quot;Possession&quot; is definitely a romance but it is so much more than that.  It is also a satire, an exploration, a diary, a critical essay a heady plunge into Victoriana and even a detective story of sorts.<br />The characters are all gems.  Wonderful creations.  Roland Michell, one notes almost immediately, is an academic to the very core.  Although Roland may seem a bit of a bore in the very beginning of the story, once he steals the letters he so desperately wants, he becomes more of a flesh-and-blood character, more human, more fallible.  Just as boring (in the beginning) as is Roland, so is Maud.  These are two characters who are meant for each other, who only change when under each other's influence.  While academic rivalry may be what sets the plot of this book in motion, it is love that becomes its driving force.<br />Much of the book is spent in the company of the fictitious Victorian writers, Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte and they are fascinating characters, indeed.  Most of the chapters begin with a fictitious work by either Ash or LaMotte.  Byatt has caught the spirit of both of these characters so well, that one could almost swear that Ash and LaMotte were real...and that they really wrote.  Ash is the more open and terse writer; LaMotte the more given to patterns of rhythm and rhyme.  Yet both writers are truly Victorians.  Although many feel that Ash and LaMotte represented Robert Browning and Christina Rosetti, I felt that LaMotte was definitely Dickensian and Ash, very much Coleridge.<br />Byatt, one of the world's outstanding writers, has lavished such care and attention on &quot;Possession&quot; that each page, each paragraph, each poem, each letter, contains material that both soothes and stimulates the mind of the reader.  <br />Although Byatt's writing may seem simple and straightforward enough, it is really exceedingly rich in both detail and allusion.  In fact, there is so much literary detail and there are so many allusions in &quot;Possession&quot; that I think many readers might miss a few with a first reading.  The readers who skip the letters and the poems are definitely making a huge mistake, for they form an integral part of the story; the book could not exist without them.  The letters also give the reader (and Roland and Maud) a great deal of information about both Randolph and Christabel and allow the parallel relationships to come into being.  And, if the reader gives them only half a chance, he or she will come to see that the letters and poems and fairy tales are rich and rewarding in and of themselves.  It is no accident that both Christabel and Maud are identified with fairy tale characters who live in towers (Christabel with Melusina and Maud with Rapunzel).<br />Don't let the subject matter of the book put you off.  Yes, failed romantic love has been done many times before and so have parallel relationships, but never quite in this way.  Never so beautifully, never in such a way that touches the heart.<br />The only criticism I have of this book is that Byatt sometimes gave in to the lure of realism and let her characters speak in such a way as to almost tinge this book's exquisitely beautiful aura.  Sure, in real life, people throwing a tirade don't take care to keep their language beautiful, but &quot;Possession&quot; isn't real life and we know it.  That is a part of its lure and I only wish Byatt had felt the same.  Expletives, in this book at least, do detract from the overall romantic and beautiful tone and from the otherwise equisiteness of Byatt's writing.<br />When it comes down to the final analysis, however, the above is simpy a quibble and &quot;Possession&quot; is a tremendous achievement.  The characters are real and believable.  We love them, we (sometimes) hate them, we pity them, we root for them.  The 19th century seems as real asyesterday and Ash and LaMotte seem to have certainly existed, contrary to the very fact that we know they did not.  The parallel relationships are braided and intertwined so carefully and beautifully that they can't help but capture both our heart and our soul.<br />&quot;Possession&quot; is a poetic, beautiful, exquisite novel that intricately weaves both the light and the dark aspects of love.  It is a sumptuous feast of a book that is meant to be luxuriated in and ultimately, loved.
B00005RJ1U|2.0|I won't go into the details of this film, as the other reviews did that for you.  I'll just give you a quick opinion of this movie... it's was weird as H-E-double-hockey-sticks, and freaky!<br />The acting was excellent... unusual for a horror movie.  This is a teen flick, but anyone that likes horror movies will like this one.  Tons of totally gross parts throughout this movie will keep you freaked and grossed out!<br />Sure this is full of holes and totally unbelievable... but a strange film that hasn't been done before.... but then, who could think this stuff up!!  Like others that reviewed this film, I hated the ending.
0385484518|4.0|I thought that the book Tuesday's with morrie was a great book to read. It was easy to follow, and to understand. I think that if you have time then you should read the book. It will make you think of life a little differently. It will change the way you think of every day things.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Robert Altman's \\"M*A*S*H\\" is certainly an anti-war film in that it's set in an army hospital near the frontlines of Korea, and features battered bodies and at least once, a geyser of blood from a severed artery.  Its main characters, Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John McIntyre (Elliott Gould), find themselves patching together the battered remains of what were once young soldiers.<BR><br />But in between marathon sessions in the OR, Hawkeye and Trapper John wage their own witty war against incompetence, confomity, hypocrisy and overbearing authority.  They carouse, drink and mercilessly bully anyone who gets in their way.  Their first target is Maj. Frank Burns (a memorable performance by Robert Duvall), an overly religious and self-righteous man given to blaming others for his mistakes.  Hawk and Trap set their sights on him and never let up, and, like its protagonists, \\"M*A*S*H\\" proceeds to take no prisoners.<BR><br />There's no plot in the classic sense.  Things happen, the wounded come in waves, and our doctor heroes proceed to mock anything and everything that comes their way.  Sutherland and Gould are an amazingly funny team, quoting old movies and dropping into strange characterizations to meet every new challenge, be it recalcitrant regular Army nurse \\"Hot Lips\\" O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman), befuddled CO Col. Henry Blake (Roger Bowen), or a football-crazy general (G. Bowen).<BR><br />Among their schemes:  faking a suicide to give a friend back his self-confidence, blackmailing an officer to save a sick child, and bringing in a ringer to win the football game that makes up the movie's uproarious climax.  In between, we get to meet such memorable characters as \\"Radar\\" O'Reilly (Gary Burgoff), the almost-psychic corporal, \\"Painless Pole,\\" (John Schuck) the \\"best equipped dentist in the Army,\\" and Lt. \\"Dish\\" (Jo Ann Pflug).  Plus Swamp-mate Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt) and the ineffectual but well-meaning Father Mulchahy (Rene Auberjonois).<BR><br />Altman packs the movie with dense, overlapping dialogue.  The result is chaotic, frenzied and hilarious.  Hollywood would never dare make a movie like this today, in which traditional values are so thoroughly and hilariously trounced; \\"M*A*S*H\\" is a truly dangerous and subversive film.  Its doctors (and \\"M*A*SH\\" itself, by extension) love only honesty, intelligence, freedom... and very dry mar-tin-eyes.  With olives!  Plus, the occasional nurse.<br /><br />Finally, this classic has the treatment it deserves.  This \\"Five Star Collection\\" release (on two disks) contains a gorgeous widescreen version of the movie, Altman's commentary, the \\"Backstory\\" documentary, two other docus, and a restoration demo.  A brilliant film in an excellent package.
0140157352|4.0|The authors of Getting to Yes are definitely on the right track but they seem to be relying too much on their intuition in drawing conclusions about the proper way to negotiate.  The book would be much better if they could formulate their ideas in terms of game theory.  Their approach towards negotiation is certainly correct but it lacks proper theoretical framework.  It is not enough just to know that cooperation yields better results than confrontation.  Seeking mutual interests may indeed be preferable over playing a hard ball but if a negotiator can't explain this pattern of behavior in terms of a coherent theory then he will remain confined by the limits of his intuition.  Intuition is certainly a great thing to have but it is not enough.  <BR>Game theory can explain the essence of mutual-gain negotiation but it can also reveal its limitations.  I wish the authors could remember the prisoners' dilemma example from their undergraduate economics classes.  Then they could have made the book even more valuable then it is.
B00005Y228|5.0|I bought this album on Import last October... It hasn't left my CD player yet! It's probably the best dance/pop album I've purchased in the last ten years. Every track (with maybe the exception of \\"Burning Up\\" which I think is a little less \\"ear grabbing\\" then the rest of the album) is Flawless. My favorite tracks; \\"Love at First Sight\\", \\"Your Love\\", \\"Love Affair\\", \\"More, More, More\\", \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" (which is like a drug it's so good!!) and the next single \\"In Your Eyes\\". I've been a Kylie fan for a while, have all her other CD's and this is by far her best album. My only gripe is that it's so short, the Austrialian and Japanese versions contained extra tracks that are by far better then the ones that were chosen for the American release. If you can pick up both the Australian and British versions of the CD single of \\"In Your Eyes\\". The Australian version has the B-sides: \\"Harmony\\" & \\"Never Spoken\\", and the British version has: \\"Tightrope\\" (extra track from Autralian version of Fever) & \\"Good Like That\\" From the Japanese version). Why these four songs were not included on all the versions of \\"Fever\\" I don't know because they are as good as anything on the CD. If you like dance music even a little, do yourself a favor and buy this disc!
B000002U8G|5.0|One of my favorite albums.  &quot;One of These Days...&quot; is an interesting and entertaining enough psychedelic instrumental.  &quot;Pillow of Winds&quot; is a nice, light, atmospheric song.  &quot;San Tropez&quot; and &quot;Seamus&quot; are pretty darned awful, I hate to admit, but &quot;Fearless&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; are, in my personal opinion, unbelievably good.  &quot;Fearless&quot; is one of my top two or three favorite songs by anyone, period, and &quot;Echoes&quot; is an amazing work.  The overall feel of the album is great if you're a fan of somewhat mellow, atmospheric, psychedelic music.
0790725657|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Shirley Temple and her version of this classic flick, but she's just cute.  This version with Liesel Matthews is a work of art.  The imagery she creates in her stories along with the music and cultural refrences are simply enchanting.  I feel every child, boy or girl, should see this movie, if not own it.
B00005JKYS|2.0|Written and directed by Randall Wallace (w/d of The Man in the Iron Mask) We Were Soldiers is yet another film based on true events and real people, yet the people are as two-dimensional as paper.  If you're going to see this film only for the big blasts, bombs, gunfire, and showbiz effects, then you'll be satisfied because there's plenty of that.  However, when I see a film advertized as being based on a true story, I want to go further than the explosions, and learn about the people.  This film offered little of that.<br />Mel Gibson is our central character, Lt. Colonel Moore, and his wife is portrayed by Madeline Stowe.  Both these actors do wonders with the little they are given, yet even then, it is not enough to make us emotionally involved.  As the Lt. Col.'s wife, Stowe would host the wives' meetings at her house.  \\"Issue one--where do we go shop when the commissary is out of something?  Does anyone know of a place to go?  Issue two--laundry.  The places on base are not reliable.  Does anyone know of someplace better?\\"  <br />I can't imagine women sitting around talking about such absolutely idiotic piffle when their husbands are out there in Vietnam getting shot at in a bloody massacre.  One could argue they were trying to focus on something else.  One could argue they were trying to deal with things within their own realm.  Okay, fine.  HOWEVER, when I DON'T see them crying, flipping out, talking about their husbands, talking about how much they love them, and are instead discussing laundry and shopping, I have to say a grand part of the equation is missing. The only time the wives were allowed to show emotion was when they were delivered the ever-so dreaded telegram informing them their husband is dead.  Are they not allowed to care for their men UNTIL then? <br />Think of the opposite as well:  how would their husbands feel knowing while they is at war their wives' biggest concern was getting the whites clean, or finding tatter tots in the frozen foodssection?  \\"Yeah, I'm out here getting shot at so I can go back home and live with a woman who's biggest worry is having enough quarters for the laudromat.  Now THAT'S love.\\" Can you see how I say this film lacks credibility, IN SPITE of it being a true story?<br />Wallace's script lacks emotion and believability, and makes us less able to mourn those who perish on the battle field.  Do I really care about these men?  Their wives don't seem to, so why should I?<br />Also given the impossible task of making a character real are the very formidible Sam Elliot and Greg Kinnear.  Poor Sam.  He is a splendid actor, yet his dialogue was reduced to nothing but one-liner quips, usually with some sort of appropriate expletive in it--I wish I could list some of them in this review as they came off absolutely hilarious.  However,this man is a very capable actor--why would Wallace want to waste him like this?  Same with Kinnear, whose role is limited to being in a helicopter.  This Oscar-nominated talent is given only two major scenes in the entire film.  Waste!<br />Like I said, if you like explosions, then see it.  If you want to be moved by the characters and learn something about Vietnam, perhaps renting Platoon will be a better option.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|One of the best movies of all time is now on THE best DVD yet made.  Most DVDs have pretty lame extra features, but this one is a cornucopia of magic and amazement.  It includes the full dance scenes, including my favorite, Hindi.  Many deleted scenes are provided, showing you that Moulin Rouge could have been even better, had Baz not had to cut it down to a \\"viewable\\" length (I could have watched this movie for hours on end!).  It also goes in depth with respect to the music behind the movie.  I love this movie, and I love this DVD!  Thanks, Baz (now work on getting a better soundtrack out there!).
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Quite possibly the most disgusting comedy ever made that never stops being funny(yes, it even beats out Theres Something About Mary), Scary Movie is undoubtadly completely absurd and absolutely hilarious.  Spoofing the totally not scary teen horror movies of late like Scream, Scary Movie takes ever cliche and makes fun of it until your laughing out loud.  It even pokes fun at teen sex comedies like American Pie with the groosout antics.  Marlon Wayans is hysterical as pot smoking Shorty, and manages to keep being funny with the pot jokes without getting stale or repetitive.  Then theres also the fact I never thought I'd see so much male genitalia in a mainstream movie, but its all done with fun in mind.  The deleted scenes are worth noting too, especially the \\"Hop Along Shorty\\" scene which is downright hilarious.  Not to be taken seriously by any means, Scary Movie deserves a place in your movie collection.
B00005KB9W|5.0|It's live but it's probably his best. That's usually unusual, because live albums reveal nothing new and usually aren't very good jams. But this album is the exception not the rule. Check it out.<br />\\"Burnin' and Lootin'\\" is great live and is an awesome song. \\"Them Belly Full(But We Hungry)\\" is another great live work on this album that just captures the song. \\"No Woman, No Cry\\" is one of the best recordings here. And Marley and The Wailers do a great job of really jamming here. My highlight of this record though is \\"I Shot The Sherrif\\" which is always been a great song, but really stands out on this version with some great live work. \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\" is another standout of this record. While I don't own many Bob Marley cds. I have to say this is probably the best he's done and it's got some of his best hits. Pick up this CD even before Legend. You will not regret it.
B00003CXXP|5.0|\\"Artificial Intelligence\\" is the best film of 2001.  The magic melding of Kubrick and Spielberg works perfectly, bringing a haunting, touching, thought provoking, and experimental film to life.  <br />\\"A.I.\\" will haunt you for days after you see it; it is a powerful film with amazing preformances, especially from the stunningly accomplished Haley Joel Osment.  <br />\\"A.I\\" will touch your emotions and bring you to the brink and perhaps over.  Spielberg returned to the three act structure of \\"Empire of the Sun\\" that worked so well in his other masterpiece.  The end of each act is emotionally grinding, the moments when David is abandoned by his mother or reacts to the other David robots, or the touchign ending to the final third act, will wrench you apart emotionally. <br />\\"A.I.\\" isn't content to remain constrained by emotion and disturbing images, it seriously deals with many different themes and concepts foreign to blockbuster cinema.  \\"A.I.\\" is that rare science fiction film that lives up to the potential of science fiction literature...\\"A.I.\\" lives up to that potential, you will be thining about the film for days, even weeks and monthes afterwards.  There are many themes and concepts dealt with in the film, either as asides ... or openly addressed.  A scathign retoric against racism, can be found in the flesh fair sequence, human fallibility and callousness are derided by the offhand way david is dismissed.  David himself displays many different human characterisics, often taking a single trait to extremes as he tries to understand and learn to be human: Especially telling are the sequences where David learns jealousy (spinach), or fear, humor, and protection (the pool scene), he also displays obsession clearly throughout the entire film.  The last act of the film is so startlingly dark that most people think it is schmaltzy.  It is extremly disturbing that humans will die and our creations will replace us, the way David is so carefully manipulated by them as theytry to see how humans act is terrifying, but because this seems to be a happy thing for David most people mistake it for a happy 'Spielberg' ending, nothing could be further from the truth. <br />A word should perhaps be said about fairy tales.  Fairy Tales are the main motif drawing the different segments of the film together.  David's Quest is inspired by a fairy tale, Pinochhio.  But his journey more closely resembles  _The Wizard of Oz_ with numerous references in the film to that more modern of fairy tales. The entire film is infact a fairy tale being told to a 'child' of the future.  This is indeed a fairy tale for adults, it has fantastical imagery can characters, with a moral message (however as mentioned above, there is much more to the film as well).  The fairy tale motif of \\"A.I.\\" is one of the amazing touches that make this such a special film.<br />Like every great Kubrick film \\"A.I.\\" pushes cinema to be more.  Traditional filmmaking says that you can't have three endings, you can't break your acts up so completely, you can't be so dark or say so much in a single film.  Spielberg and Kubrick took all those tradtional rules and rejected them, the result was an astoundingly powerful film that by no means adheres to any specific rules of filmmaking.  Spielberg has often been criticized for the artistic license he takes to make stories more cinematic, his films celebrate the human spirit (for the most part), this film is a dark departure from what he traditionally produces.  Spielberg, over the past twentyfive years has delivered soem of the greatest motionpictures ever.  His storytelling was always within the bounds of the 'rules' and he excelled at it; his cinematography may have had new tricks or older, obscure tricks made popular, but he was always focused on telling the best possible story.  That is why his films resonate with so many people.  But with \\"A.I.\\" Spielberg is pushing himself in new and interesting artistic directions, he is experimentingwith how that peculair canvas of film can be used to tell stories in new ways, his achievement in \\"A.I.\\" only serves to illustrate that before you can break the rules, you have to know them first.
0767802659|4.0|The acting isn't that great & the story isn't the best, but there is just something about this movie I can't get enough of. Now fighting large insects that take hundreds of bullets to kill is not the greatest idea in the world, but the special effects, sound, and action are quite excellent. This movie moves right along too. The action never seems to stop whether its training to be a Citizen(which seems to be the only way you can do many things like be a politician or have a baby) Oor fighting \\"The Bug\\".And not all of the main characters make it through this movie alive. I have only had the DVD for about 3 weeks, but I have watched it 8 times. Would be a five star movie if there was better acting. But for the special effects & action, this is definitely a good movie.
B00005Y228|5.0|This album cannot disappoint. The music on this album gets catchier/better with each song, and \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" is definitely NOT the strongest track. With great tracks like \\"Fever\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Come Into My World\\" and \\"Give It To Me\\", the great mix of euro-pop, electronica and ... lyrics make this one of the year's best. Its about time Kylie's talent was recognized in the US.
B000002ADT|5.0|This disc, I picked up after hearing so much about it. I never heard any of the music on it. I bought it, and wondered if it was worth it once I got home. I put it on and I was shocked. After listening to three tracks I was hooked. This album was masterful, to say the least. And it inspired so many musicians today. It's great.<br />&quot;So What&quot; kicks it off with a great solo by Miles Davis and it has a nice theme to it. This is great jazz music to listen or just great music to listen to period. Coltrane offers some of his best stuff on here as well. &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; is another great song that features some nice piano work, and Coltrane and Adderly really get into here. &quot;Blue in Green&quot; is a great ballad song with some awesome muted trumpet played by Miles Davis. &quot;All Blues&quot; is a slow number that is interesting and unique. Both &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; the alternate and the orginal are both great and Spanish flavored. It's a great song much like Blue in Green, but somewhat different. The best cues are &quot;So What&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; but all of them are masterful.<br />Get a copy today!
B00003CXI0|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone the movie made the book come to life. I finally know exactly how a Quiditch game is played and what the castle really looked like. The movie made all of the character seemed exactly as I saw them in my mind. The movie was thrilling! I want to see it again and again and again...
B00005BCPC|5.0|This is a MAJOR, MAJOR, MAJOR Chick Flick.<br />I wanted to rent Vertical Limit but, NO, it was already freezing outside and my wife was not feeling 100 percent -- so, on the recommendation of the video store owner, I opted for Mansfield Park.  It's one of those period pieces with costumes and sailing ships and beautiful British scenery, with a plot that had a lot to do with girls giggling together.  All of these Emily Austen, or Jane Bronte or whatever shows seem to be film adaptations of books penned by young English women about young English women encountering inspirational experiences for books they are penning.<br />Guys, if you want to make your girl happy, then obtain this film and watch it with her... and be attentive, cheerful and cordial while doing so.  She will enjoy the experience, and will be quite pleased with you.  If you can do so with no problems, have a liter of good wine handy, and sip it steadily throughout the movie.  Wine won't convert this Major Chick Flick to Vertical Limit, but a sufficient quantity of it will make the Mansfield Park experience tolerable for a typical ordinary guy.
B000062XFG|4.0|The Second Season of Next Gen. is by no means flawless. A writters strike that year did not help matters either. there are however some excellent episodes in this season, particularly Measure of a Man which alone makes this collection worthwhile. This season also has the other doctor while Crusher was away. They were going for a Bones and Spock relationship with her and Data. At times it works and it makes this an intresting, different season from the rest. The charecters begin to gel this season better as well. Picard starts to become the Picard we love, not that akward brit faking a bad french accent. Still, if you are just a causual fan save your money for season three on first before you invest in this. [It's] a lot to spend for a season with ups and downs. It is however much better than the first.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is one of my favorite musical albums and it is U2 best so far. People may think I'm crazy because of Joshua Tree. And Joshua Tree is a good album, but this one is so much better. A great work. And to think they almost broke up before this album was put together. Here's a track by track analysis:<br />1.) Zoo Station- this is an explosive start and I love the line that starts &quot;I'm ready, ready for what's next&quot; This musically is one of the strongest starts to their cds.<br />2.) Even Better Than The Real Thing- it's somewhat simple but has some great stuff too it and continues the albums strong start.<br />3.) One- this song was born out of the band almost breaking up, I have heard. It's a great song and one of the strongest on the album. It is a wonderful ballad sung by Bono.<br />4.) Until the End of The World- it has one of the coolest drum beats ever at the beginning and has some excellent guitar work done by The Edge. Welcome back U2!<br />5.) Who's Going to Ride Your Wild Horses- my favorite U2 song of all time. People may think I'm crazy, but this song just is great. lyrically, musically it's awesome stuff.<br />6.) So Cruel- this haunting well written song has some great string work that is beyond description. Still gives me chills.<br />7.) The Fly- another rocking song that stays true to the album's core and some Bono's gospel type singing styles. <br />8.) Mysterious Ways- when I first heard this song I wasn't really much on it, but I'm glad I kept listening to it. It's a great song with some great work by all the guys Bono, The Edge, Clayton, and Mullen. Listen to it.<br />9.)Tryin' to Throw Your Arms Around the World- it's a great song that just displays more of U2 fine talent.<br />10.) Ultraviolet (Light My Way)- It's the weak point of the album, but it still stands as a good song and it's got a catchy chorus.<br />11.) Acrobat- another rocker that just plain rocks. This is one is just plain cool. With some wicked guitar work by The Edgecheck out the solo in it. Wow!<br />12.) Love is Blindness- I couldn't think of a better ending to this record. And it's my favorite closing track for any U2 album. It's haunting, beautiful, and has some great lyrics. U2 hit all the right places on this album.<br />Get this album today!
0385335482|5.0|Love it, love it, love it. I see myself so much in Rebecca Bloomfield....shopping....in a dead-end job (thank goddess I make more $$$ than she does however). Rebecca is like a best friend that you want to just sit back with a glass of champagne and cry, laugh and tell all of your secrets. I just finished this book and ran out and (in Becca fashion...CHARGED) Sophie Kinsella's new book, Shopaholic take Manhattan.<br />This is one book that I'll pass to friends, but will not be selling.
B000040OBS|4.0|This album starts with some good subtle raw electronics with some nice subtle melodies on ROCKET USA and CHEREE but the longest song FRANKIE TEARDROP is downright scary. As the vocals kick in and tells a story complete with some errie screams that will have you startled.<br />Truly innovative if you like Krautrock and Spacerock you will like this.  Sort of a darker side of Kraftwerk.  Makes Marylin Manson and NIN look like little girls.
B00000J631|2.0|Short Music For Short People is perhaps too short for me. The songs aren't really songs, like someone said. It seems to me that Fat Mike said, \\"hey, let's take a chance\\" and he did, but it didn't work. If you ask me, the best songs are from the already established bands like Blink 182, Offspring, Green Day, Pennywise, The Vandals, The Ataris, Unwritten Law, AFI, Nerf Herder, NOFX, Misfits, Guttermouth, etc. A lot of the hardcore bands on here (Spazz to name one) are just terrible, and what's the ... deal with the Lunachicks? Some of the songs are just noise or unstructured music. A lot of people say the bad songs don't overshadow the good, but I disagree, to me, [money] isn't worth the 15 minutes or so of good tunes, and an extra 40 minutes of .... If I were you, I'd say download the songs from the bands listed above: after all, it wouldn't take that long to download, and you saved yourself [money]. I didn't. Be happy for that.
B0000399WI|5.0|From the minute I watched the movie to now I still can't say their is a better movie than this. This movie is so gripping, so aweome, and it's great. A monumental achievement for Frank Darabont.<br />This movie takes place in the 40's where Andy(Tim Robbins) is charged with the deaths of his wife and the man who was having an affair with her. He gets two life sentences for the crime. He meets up with Red(Morgan Freeman) in prison and the two form a friendship that teaches Red about life and hope. Red is the guy who can get things for people and Andy ask for something a little unusual Rita Haworth. The reason is not clear until later in the movie. Red delivers with a poster of her. The movie reaches its highpoint near the end and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't seen this movie. The ending is awesome. Both actors here deliver their best performances and the director/writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of adapting the story to screen. (He's a big Steven King fan by the way). This is a must have for anybody. It's main themes are faith, hope, and the human spirit. It's just awesome!<br />Watch it twice, three times, it gets better each time you watch it. Trust me.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe has once again managed to write and direct a wonderful piece of work. Just watching this movie takes the old, even the young back to a time where you could just be free and a time of TRUE rock. Back when bands knew what they were doing with the instuments in hand. Back when it was only about the music, the fans, the rush! The money comes next but the good times are always there.<BR>   Enjoy this movie again and again.
0871137380|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, great book and great movie. A must book and movie to check out!
B00005R23S|5.0|I have collected just about everything possible of Springsteen's over the years. My biggest regret is that I never got to see him LIVE.  This DVD brings me &quot;almost&quot; that experience.  There are a few tracks omitted I would have wished for, but overall, it is a great summation of the Boss's &quot;stuff&quot;.  Hard to believe at his age he still puts out the vibes and energy of his youth - yet his music has evolved over all these years and he just gets better and better. I rented this first at my video store, and after watching it, I knew I HAD to have it for myself to play again and again.  It is THE best!
0684800713|5.0|Any man who had a women in front of him, ready to make love, but \\"couldn't,\\" because of impotence or depression or both can certainelly understand the predictiment of Jake Barnes..  There is nothing to say but only to do, and he can not do it...  This is the meta-tension which surrounds all of the events in this novel-Jake's inability to make love to Brett and his inability to face her in this \\"dysfunctional\\" state.  The realism between a man and a women, Jake and Brett, who have nothing to say to each other untill after the lovemaking-which can not be done...well, it is really and frightingly accurate.<br />This is a really serious novel and frightingly real.  Hemmingway in the persona of Barnes is ambivilant.  On the one hand he sees the misfortunes of his fellow ex-pats, on the other, he is, in his inflected state of being, understanding just what is going on around him and wishes that Cohn and the others could be as brave and as stoic (or as drunk) as him..<br />This novel is tough and hardened in its perspective but what else is Jake to do under the circumstances??
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The people who hate this movie seem to base their loathing on a radical hatred of anachronism.  I think that saying this movie is terrible on the basis of its anachronisms is ludicrous.  I think that we all need to realize that Moulin Rouge wasn't supposed to be a historically accurate movie.  I found it a wonderful, stimulating, and exciting romp through a postmodern Paris.  The pop music seen through a new lens really proves that in Moulin Rouge, the medium really was the message.
B00005QW5X|5.0|A fantastic film is transferred flawlessly to DVD.   The story of Hedwig and his angry inch is just as moving on the small screen at home as it was in theatres.   Special DVD features, including the excellent feature-length documentary on the making of the film, and the musical number table of contents for those who just want to view the songs again, are wonderful.<br />Mitchell delivers a tour de fource performance as a transgendered diva of punk/rock song. Miriam Shor is equally convincing as his female to male counterpart, and the music and lyrics by Stephen Trask are an appropriately moving mixture of Bowie and musical theatre rock.  Not to be missed.<br />This should have been on everyone's top 10 film lists for 2001.
048622709X|4.0|This book is good for learning to draw different hand positions. It contains different values and details on drawing all kinds of hands. It's a good learning tool for beginning artist and it's worth the price.
0671042858|4.0|The story was very well written.  It really held your interest throughout the entire book, however, I kept expecting the supernatural to be involved when she felt she was being chased by some &quot;thing in the woods&quot;.  This book has nothing to do with the supernatural, yet has more to do with the very thin line of reality and hallucination.  If you go into this book knowing it has nothing to do with the supernatural, then you won't be let down and it is a great read.
B00000DGUG|3.0|After the huge sucess of Jagged Little Pill, Alanis needed to find a new persona. She needed to evolve. Well after trips to India and Cuba, she popped out this. Supposed Former Infatution Junkie is a porrait of a confused yet less bitter Alanis. Her lyrics are intelligent and funny as always and musically, she's never sounded better. There's something slightly annoying though. Some songs are beautifully written and sound beautiful but Alanis gets ahead of herself. On some songs, her intelligent lyrics turn into ramblings and her music gets too heavy and waves over her lyrics and scrambles them. SFIJ isn't a necessarily happy Alanis. She's still struggling to find her ground but she definetely is on her way. Goodbye anger and bitterness.<br />Standout Tracks- ''Thank U'' ''Unsent'' ''That I Would Be Good''
B00005Y228|4.0|I'd heard of Kylie Minogue before.  Her hits overseas have infiltrated clubs all over the US, but her albums were almost non-existent!  I've seen her cameo in Moulin Rouge and heard her American single, &quot;Locomotion&quot;.  But when I heard &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; I was hooked!  Her album, Fever, is nothing short of fabulous.  It's not very soulful, but it's a damn catchy, fun dance album.  The 14 tracks on this US version are so much fun to listen to, I found myself putting the CD player on repeat, especially to the songs, &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Boy&quot;!  It's a shame that her earlier albums aren't available in the US.  I totally want more!  Definitely try this album if you like the genre.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie. I thought this book was an absolute wonder. This was one of the greatest books I have ever read. <BR>  It will make you look at life all differently. Everyone should read this book. It is a must. I guarantee that you will fall in love with Morrie, forgive Mitch, and just thank Charlotte. This book is absolutely wonderful. <BR>  This book is a must for everyone in the world and of all ages.
B000002A3T|4.0|And in my opinion, i've decided to be on the positive side. We have to go forward, Roger Waters will not come back...This is still a good cd, I have a good feeling about it, and when I first heard it I was young and didn't know anything about the Gilmour-Waters saga.This is far from their best albums, but in my mind it's a good work.
B000003S09|5.0|The folks who trashed this release then and now, just don't get historical significance. Like Alexis Koerner, Cyril Davies, and Graham Bond in their contribution to what we know as rock today, its easy to overlook the spark from the flame. The musical stylings and genre's put forth in this release were so far ahead of its time, the understanding for many people is beyond comprehension. The meticulousness of Fripp is what so many artists throughout time have striven. It's also what clouds many peoples minds in knowing just who these icons are. Just as Tool's music today is mis-understood by so many the same has to be said of KC. To be stranded on a desert island with one reviewers stash of one hit wonders, would certainly be a fate worse than death. I'll gladly retire to that island with my collection of the creative genius that few rock artists have acheived. First in the CD player will certainly be \\"In The Court of The Crimson King\\".
B00005Y1TL|5.0|To think he was 14 when he started making this! The best ambient music. Almost 20 years old but sounds timeless. Highlights: Xthal, ageispolis, heliosphan, we are the music makers, ptolemy, green calx. Very recommended, and a must have for any Aphex fan.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've been deeply into music and collecting since I was 5 (over 40 years). Yes, I have what most people would discribe and very likely have in their collections mainstream rock. I.E. The Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin, Skynyrd, U2, Bizkit. If you want to classify any of these artists mainstream. Many do. However, the artists in rock who have always left the most lasting mark on my heart and mind have been those most misunderstood by the majority of this species. Robert Johnson, Alexis Koerner, Dylan, Pink Floyd (the Syd Barrett era), The Pretty Things, Mahavishnu Orchestra, ZAPPA, KING CRIMSON are those most notable. It's so apparent, the familiarity that Tool has with the afformentioned. For those misguided of our species, this I'm sure is the reason Tool chose King Crimson to open on part of the Lateralus tour. Pushing the envelope, and watching it bend. Reaching out to embrace the random. Following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been. I'm going to ride this spiral to the end, because I may just go where no one's been. Spiral Out. Keep Going.
B000002KDG|5.0|Neil Young's \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" was originally two album sides--one acoustic (the first five tracks) and one electric (the last four with Crazy Horse).  As with most proper albums, the cd is fairly short (less than 39 minutes) but the listener still gets his money's worth. Acoustically, Neil has never sounded better.  'My My, Hey Hey' is terrific and even rivals its explosive, electric sibling 'Hey Hey, My My'.  In between the rock n' roll classic bookends are some great acoustic numbers ('Thrasher' is one of the hardest rocking acoustic tracks I've heard, and 'Pocahontas' is simply perfect) and the riproaring, electrically charged 'Powderfinger'.  The acoustic/electric mix works perfectly and by the time the last guitar-feedback-fury finishes bouncing around inside your head, you'll want to hear the acoustic side again.  A terrific cd in every respect.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Special effects as with all movies like this are state-of-the-art impressive.Unfortunately,good though the main attack sequences are,they don't compensate for the sheer.Woodenness of three leads.I used the skip button alot.The use of obviously modern ships for many scenes is also irritating-surely ILM could have managed a few more effects basically this is a real stinker and should win a golden turkey.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I'll admit, I bought this cd because the singer/pianist on the album's cover looks so darn much like the Canadian barmaid who busted up my third marriage (and cost me one of the better jobs I have had).  Not sure why I felt compelled to shell out some cash for this, but I am impulsive.  Luckily (and for once), the money was well spent.  Norah Jones has put out a very enjoyable cd (the memories of my Canadian fling notwithstanding) encompassing several styles and entirely relaxing and soothing.  In essense, genres covered include primarily jazz and singer-songwriter (folk), but there's also a hint of country and blues.  It's all very laid-back and fairly bare (whoopie!) and makes for some great easy listening.  I suppose I should warn you that Ms. Jones' voice may take a little getting used to--not that it's bad, it's just a little different sounding (kinda like a much toned down version of the Chipmunks).  Nevertheless, the music on this disc is terrific, the singing not bad, and the songs very very good.  All in all, it is luscious.  HHD.
B00003CXTG|5.0|See it now.It's the best.Be ready to cry.
B000050HTO|3.0|Now, I can't give this recording a bad rating- after all, Bob Dylan is one of the greatest songwriters of all time and this double CD contains some of the greatest songs that he has written.  What I can do, is say that this album is not recording that I would suggest a new Dylan fan, or even a huge Dylan fan to buy.  \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\" is like pages ripped out of dozens of amazing books, and thrown together on top of each other.  Maybe I am just an anti-greatest hits type of person, but this albumn leaves me feeling a little incomplete.<br />I don't think that you can throw together a double-CD worth of songs taken off of a couple dozen records and call it \\"essential\\".  What is essential is to listen to the different Dylan albumns by themselves and hear every song and how it compliments the others.  How can \\"Rainy Day Woman\\" and \\"Just Like a Woman\\" possibly sum up Blonde on Blonde- possibly the finest album ever put together?  How can you understand the power and sadness of Blood on the Tracks by hearing just \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" and \\"Shelter From the Storm\\"?<br />The answer- you can't.  Some of the masterpieces of Dylan are on these two CD's, but it lacks the power of an epic album.  If you want a cheap way to get aquainted with Dylan, or if you just want to carry these two \\"essential\\" CD's around instead of the whole lot, than \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\" might be for you.  <br />But if you really want to hear and understand Dylan, buy some of his complete albums.  You will be much more satisfied than listening to a bunch of songs and getting tired of them before you realize their meaning.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This second World War spectacular succeeds brillantly when in mid-battle,but sinks like a torpedaed battleship when it tries to play out a shallowly sentimental wartime love story.Unfortunately,only one of the film's three sections really wors,so the films as a whole disappointment.
B000001GPX|5.0|This album is one of the greatest performance of all the symphony recordings and everlasting! Carlos Kleiber's work in it shares the summit with Furtwangler's and Tiscanini's.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I agree screw the critics.I'd admit it is not a perfect movie,yet it is really worth seeing.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Sometimes you get dissapointed. The &quot;Special Edition&quot;, the &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot;, the &quot;Director Cut&quot; doesn't add nothing into the mix. Instead, they substract some cash for nothing.<br />This is not the case.<br />The 35 or so additional minutes of footage contained in the &quot;Untitled&quot; version are absolutely fabulous. Every single additional scene fits perfectly into the original movie, adding more substance, explaining something, or simply providing more information you finally thank for. The only question it raises is &quot;why this version didn't get into the theaters?&quot;.<br />The second DVD (&quot;Almost Famous&quot;) is an excellent movie by itself. Go and enjoy it. And give some thought on your professional life. <br />Plus, the CD with six songs by Stillwater (one of them, &quot;Fever Dog&quot; was part of the Soundtrack CD, the other five are new releases in the format) are excellent songs briefly performed in the movie.
B00003CXTG|5.0|See it.Don't be scared away by the reviewers saying it's only a love story.It is partly a love story,but it is also much more.We loved it.
0060392886|5.0|I've followed the Crue since 1982 and have read so much about the band, listened to interviews, and watched them on TV. Knowing all I know about them, I could not put this book down once I started reading it. It's amazing to actually hear how the band was consumed by drugs and alcohol.<br />The book follows each member from childhood. It gives you a sense of each member's personality and shows you a different side of them not seen by the public. While each member's tales of their upbringing were interesting, Nikki's childhood stories are the most interesting and moving. Moving past childhood and adolescence, the member's chronicle their way into music and Motley Crue.<br />From their wild nights and endless days of partying while making a name for themselves in L.A., see how the band promoted themselves, and snagged a record deal with Elektra Records. It amazing that they got signed after reading just how wild they were before they hit the big time. At that point, the party had only begun.<br />The Dirt allows you to see the real people behind the Bad Boy Rock Star Images of the Motley members. While they are one of the wildest bands to walk the face of this earth, they are in fact human and have faced more problems and turmoil than most of us combined will ever know. Some of their problems may have been self inflicted but none the less, real problems. With all the good and bad they went through, they made it out alive and left their mark in rock and roll.<br />This book covers everything Motley. The wild tours, fights, arrests, deaths, recording sessions, parties, groupies and more. Motley Crue lived the Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll life style like no other band. VH1's \\"Behind The Music\\" only scratched the surface of the bad boys story. If you want it all, pick up \\"The Dirt\\" and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B000002UT5|5.0|First of all, the one star review is ridiculous. The songs were big hits. A third album?. Richard has released 4 albums since, plus a greatest hits. This reviewer must still be trapped in 1989. Okay, moving on. This follow up to his mega successful debut album, is even catchier than the first. The big hits here were two incredibly gorgeous ballads, &quot;Angelia&quot;, and a song he originally didn't want on the album, &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;. The rest of this fun and bouncy CD is filled with up tempo songs. The other best songs here are &quot;If You Don't Want My Love&quot;, &quot;My Heart On The Line&quot;, and &quot;Satisfied&quot;. The best song here is the final track, &quot;Children Of The Night&quot;, about homeless kids. The lyrics are dead on and tell the truth. This isn't deep or meaningful music as his later albums would be. It's fun, innocent pop, and isn't meant to be taken any other way. Just listen and have fun. I still can't believe that one star review. What world are they in?!.
0385484518|4.0|Not really about Morrie, this book was recommended to me by so many people that I had to read it. Yes, its worth reading if only because of Mitch Albom's honesty.  I still look forward to hearing from Morrie's wife whose story would be of benefit to anyone who has tended the death of a loved one.  While it may not be pretty--death is afterall a nasty, painful, and ugly business--...

B00005MAM2|5.0|In the year 1989, a new type of Atomic bomb was dropped on Tokyo, Japan. In the confusion that followed nobody determined who had dropped the bomb by WW3 had begun. The world fell and then re-grew. It is now 2031, the countries of the world have returned to power and the area where the bomb dropped is just outside the metropolis, Neo-Tokyo. The citizens of the city are in complete hatred from the government is ramped and anarchy rules the streets. It?s in this atmosphere that the AKIRA project came to light.<br />Akira is the greatest and best selling anime epic ever to be released from Japan. Winning international awards and the first anime ever to grace to west of the world and started a flood of more as anime?s popularity grew. Akira base on the best selling set of graphic novels is not that good an adaptation but as a stand alone anime deserves high praise.<br />Akira is the one anime to base all anime?s on and it?s now your chance to own the greatest anime to be made in your lifetime, you won?t be disappointed.
B00003CXXP|4.0|First let me state that I am a long-time science fiction reader (true fans call it &quot;SF&quot;, never &quot;sci-fi&quot;).  The movie-going public has been conditioned by &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot;, etc. to expect nothing from science-fiction movies except awesome special effects and outrageous action scenes, and to be disappointed/confused when they are offered more.  Yes, &quot;A.I.&quot; has its flaws, but the basic story, as with the best of SF, makes us think.  When we, as a society, have the power to create intelligent beings, what are our obligations to them?  &quot;A.I.&quot; is worth watching for its exploration of this theme alone.  See &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; for another take on the subject.  Both movies are based on written works by masters of the genre.  The basic premise cannot help but show through any flaws of the movie-making process.  &quot;A.I.&quot; is no &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; but both movies make an assumption of intelligence on the part of the viewer, an assumption that seems lacking in most movies today.

006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud has been called the Marshall McLuhlan of comic books, which comes as no surprise since McCloud seeks to do for comics what \\"The Father of Modern Media\\" did for television.  Strictly an exploration of the language of \\"sequential art\\" (a term coined by legendary writer/artist Will Eisner, McCloud's direct predecessor in the study of comics as an art form) rather than a history of the medium or how-to guide, \\"Understanding Comics\\" deconstructs the iconographic imagery of comic art and how, when married with the written word and arranged methodically on the page, creates a unique mode of expression rivaling any other art form in terms of its potential for effectively communicating narrative, emotions and ideas.<br />Social perception of the comics medium has been always been marred by the fact that most of us rarely encounter the medium outside of perusing the \\"funnies\\" or leafing through the pages of \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Archie\\" while waiting in line at the supermarket.  In the eyes of the public, comics are little more than lowbrow cultural artifacts designed as disposable entertainment for kids and those who don't like to read anything that isn't accompanied by pictures.  But one only has to turn to works like Art Spiegelman's \\"Maus\\" or Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" to realize the literary, artistic and even journalistic possibilities that exist within the confluence of words and images that defines \\"sequential art\\".<br />\\"Understanding Comics\\" is not, however, about passing judgment on the merits of any particular style or genre.  Rather, McCloud contends that the format is merely a canvas offering the artist unlimited freedom to express his or her distinct vision.  Everything from the use of style, composition, shading, juxtaposition, color, panel arrangement and the ever-critical notion that what is omitted from the page is every bit as important as what is included (hence the book's subtitle, \\"The Invisible Art\\") is brought together to characterize an exhilarating art form that deserves further study, exploration and, most of all, appreciation.<br />Early on in the book it becomes apparent that McCloud exhibits a true passion for the subject, and wants his readers to share that love and enthusiasm with him.  It's hard to resist the friendly, conversational tone McCloud employs to persuade us to join him in his inner circle of insight and understanding about a medium few ever think to explore.  It is only appropriate that \\"Understanding Comics\\" is itself presented as a long-form comic book that effectively demonstrates what it preaches.  Some of the techniques McCloud uses to (literally) illustrate his points are simply brilliant.  He opens the second chapter of the book, \\"The Vocabulary of Comics\\", with a real zinger: a cerebral sucker punch of sorts that completely unravels our perceived relationship with the printed page.<br />To grasp the slippery correlation between the written word and the iconographic image, to understand the many ways that time can be represented by space on the page, to recognize the relationship between the real and the representational... these are the moments of pure joy that the reader can look forward to experiencing throughout the course of the book.  In \\"Understanding Comics\\", McCloud has created the perfect primer on the subject of \\"Comics as an Art Form\\".  It's an accessible, intelligent and entertaining work that will provide a wealth of insight to regular readers of comics as well as convince the uninitiated to take a closer look at this fascinating medium.g art form that deserves further study, exploration and, most of all, appreciation.<br />Early on in the book it becomes apparent that McCloud exhibits a true passion for the subject, and wants his readers to share that love and enthusiasm with him.

B00003CXGP|4.0|I was stunned to see WHO played Patrick Bateman in this movie.  One of my favorite films of all time, &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (see my review if interested) starred a fourteen-year old Christian Bale with a heavy English accent.  What happened!?  He's all grown-up, hunky, and quite the convincing actor (even the accent is gone!).  I thought this movie was good.  As I have stated in another review, this book was banned in places accessible to me during my high school years.  I eventually read the book to discover that it was quite a work of art, often reminiscent of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;.  The movie adaptation is well-done, even though it left out much of the gore of the printed edition.<BR>   <BR> The story takes place amidst the decadence and hairspray atmosphere of the 80's.  Patrick Bateman(Bale) and his friends are obsessed with women, money, great restaurant reservations, and themselves.  Patrick's whole existence is identified to us by his lifestyle.  He is obsessed about everything from his skin care line to his business cards. He is perfect and seemingly normal to his peers.  However, this hunky, wealthy, &quot;perfect&quot; guy has a big secret: When this Wall Street yuppie is not trying to get into &quot;Dorsia&quot;,  NYC's finest restaurant, he's an insane serial killer.  Patrick lives two lives that have only one thing in common...his obsession for cleanliness and perfection. Is he truly insane, or are we all?  It's a rough question to ask yourself while peeking into his behaviors through night and day.  <br />The ending leaves us a bit confused. It seemed rushed.  I can't give it away, but it leaves some questions to toss around for hours after finishing the movie.  I thought performances by Reese Witherspoone (&quot;Legally Blonde&quot;) and Chloe Soveigny (&quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;) were well done. In all, this is a great film to rent. I won't recommend purchase. I think the extreme gore would probably, in my opinion be a little tiring after a while, but I must say, I couldn't get enough of Patrick Bateman's constant sarcasm.  He has some lines that are so laughable, you sometimes forget this is a Drama/Suspense or Horror in most video stores.  While not a perfect &quot;date movie&quot; (my own sarcastic attempt), &quot;American Psycho&quot; is sure to please if you have a good sense of humor.  I can't wait to see what movies Christian Bale will choose in the future.  He has done well painting the tale of a psychopath with excellent taste in food and ties.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Describing Fiona Apple's When the Pawn... is like trying to describe a dessert or food item; you rant and rave but they don't get the point; it's just too subjective and personal of an expernece to adequately describe.  Finally, you get so frustrated that you nearly force them to try it.  \\"Just taste it god...\\"  When the Pawn is a special album and it means a lot to a lot of different people.  Fiona Apple is a goddess.  She writes lyrics that could be perfectly adequate poetry by themselves, music that's as ambitious, ingenius, and often times inaccessible as anything Radiohead did on Kid A, and her personality conveyed by her lyrics is that of a kind, opinionated, troubled but together young women who is always getting over someone or dumping someone or finding herself in ackward situations like the one described in Love Ridden where she doesn't know whether or not to kiss her boyfriend on the cheek or wave goodbye to him after a fight.  She gives dating<BR>and relationships a tragic romanticism and delights in her sorrows, but she's not afraid to tell some guy off, like in the aptly titled kiss off, \\"Get Gone\\" and the hilariously explicit<BR>\\"Limp.\\"  But mostly, it is a deeply serious, murkily depressing affair, one that can suck you in as soon as Prozac can suck you out, but ultimately, music lovers, check out this wreck and you'll see why I'm writing this review.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was one of those people that didn't see Moulin Rouge when it was in theaters, and now I'm really sad I didn't.  Seeing this movie on a small tv screen does not do it justice.  The visuals are absolutely amazing, and the acting performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor are electrifying.  The story was straight-forward, but the way director Baz Luhrman brought it to life was incredible.  It's a damn shame he wasn't nominated for best director for this year's Oscars, because Moulin Rouge is easily one of the best and most imaginative films of 2001.

B00003CWL6|1.0|Ooooooooooh, the suburbs are petri dishes that breed boredom and contempt.  Crass consumerism is rampant.  Parents and teens are disconnected.  Tell us something new.  None of the plot points were innovative or even shocking.  So what- the weird kid sells high grade pot.  The successful gay couple are \\"startlingly\\" normal.  The military man is a closet homosexual.  The ad guy father rediscovers the joys of getting high and gets back in touch with himself as a sexual creature.  His wife is high strung and out of touch with the joy of living.  His daughter pouts because her family [is dysfunctional].  His daughter's best friend has apparently overdosed on an unhealthy combination of Cosmopolitan magazine and MTV (but she's still a virgin.  Hw's that for a gripping plot twist?).<br />Not only did they need to come up with a better script, this movie isn't even interesting to look at.  We all know the culturally withered upper middle class American suburbs are well-groomed and boring.  And the whole rose petal thing was cheezy.

B00005Y228|2.0|I was looking forward to purchasing this album after everything I heard on TV. But to my greatest disappointment the album is far from being even very good. There are just a couple of songs (like &quot;can't get you out of my head&quot; and &quot;in your eyes&quot; that I can replay on a daily basis... Looks like this CD will collect dust in the CD box.
B00005K9LK|2.0|I know alot of people love this album, and think it's priest's best album,but I think this record is over rated.THey were a more influential band before they released the Point of Entry album.Everything after British Steel in my opinion is second rate material.Not to say that I dont like some of the records released after British Steel,but they were not the influential band they were before the \\"Point of Entry\\" debocle.They tryed to reclame their Metal sound on this Record but they half-assed it.it's just way to poppy.I love the title track,the song \\"Electric Eye\\" and \\"Riding on the Wind\\" but I think the rest of the album is prety weak.I think the hit single off this album \\"you got another thing comin\\" is a louzy song.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie but i can understand why people did not like it. Moulin Rouge is very different. You either love it or you hate it. If you like music, than you will love this movie. You will probably hate it if you are not to open minded, or if you do not like fanatsy movies or movies that go almost to above and beyond. I loved this movie mainly for it's music. They have a very wide range of songs from like a virign to I will always love you. Ewan Mcgregor's voice is so adorable. I was extremly ill when i saw this movie for the first time. I acctually started sleeping through it until i heard Ewan's voice for the first time . I was so sick i think that i started to cry, it is just so gorgeous. Nicloe's voice is alright, she seems to be off pitch sometime though. But, when all is said and done if this movie did not have any music it could not survive on it's own. There are two parts in the movie that are just really wierd, the poetry reading, and the like a virgin. John Legizamo preformance as Tohloouse is good, but it seems that Baz just put him in there to have another character, he's trying to hard. That downgrades the movie. The costume designs and the cinematorgaphy are well done.And the chemistary between Nicole and Ewan is faboulas.<BR>As i am writing this review i want to change my review form 5 stars to 4, but i can't, i just love this movie too much, and i would feel guilty for a long time. I don't really know what it is about this movie me love it. It is unexplainable. And, ...
157453470X|3.0|Firstly, this edition was listed as unabridged when I ordered it. I thought it was too good to be true, and it was. So I started off [angry].<br />I read the book and absolutely loved it, by the way. I bought the audiobook to listen to while driving. Sterling's use of narrative description is just the kind of thing I like listening to on the road. It was also what was ripped from this story to make it fit on six cassette tapes.<br />I suppose in a book of this size something has to go, but it seems that all that is left here are the business deals and legal contortions.<br />For gosh sakes, they cut the \\"Ultimate Bowl of Captain Crunch\\"!.

B000003TA4|5.0|To the customer walking through a music store and find themselves staring at a naked baby with the word \\"Nivana\\" written across the front and wondering whether they should buy the famous album or not.  Is this even a question?  Ive talked to many people about music, and Nirvana's Nevermind always comes up as one of their favorite albums if not their favorie album.  The cd's a classic.  It outsold michael jackson. It's simply a must have.  Its the best rock album of 90s and possibly the best album ever made.  Almost all of the songs on the album are played on the radio everyday.  There is not one person I have met who does not like this album.  This is seriously not a debatable topic.  Ask anyone in the world.  Its black and white.  Nevermind is one of the best albums ever made and you must buy it now.  Its powerful grunge, its powerful vocals, its a humongous powerful sound.  There is not one bad song on this cd.  Let's face the facts: buy it buy it buy it!!!!!
B00004WGAI|4.0|This is by far my wife's and my favorite version.  I hope it's made available soon on DVD.
B000002MY3|5.0|Jagged Little Pill went on to sell more than 30 million copies, making it the biggest selling album by a female of all time and one of the biggest selling albums, period.<br />Just one listen and you can see why. For my money there isn't any chaff whatsoever on this album - i.e. no redundant tracks. Don't be fooled by the media hype which dismisses Alanis as an Angry White Female. Apart from the boyfriend bashing track &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; there is no concentrated lyrical effort in this area.<br />This is a solid Rock album which pivots on Morissette's &quot;This is me, take it or leave it&quot; honesty - a refreshing thing in an industry full of posers. There are so many classic tracks on this album that it is futile to list them, and I would strongly recommend JLP as a logical entry point to AM's recorded works.<br />Another one for the Desert Island CD collection.
B00005Y228|5.0|A response to the A music fan from Vacaville, CA USA ...I'm not sure when you were first introduced to Kylie, but I'm assuming she appeared on your radar screen via MTV within the past few months.  If you love &quot;CGYOOMH&quot; but hate the rest of the album, you don't really understand who Kylie is and where she is coming from.  Perhaps you should go listen to the latest coming-of-age pop sensation rolling off the American assembly line.  Hats off to Kylie for not opting to adapt her unique cheeky sensibility to please the bland American pop palate raised on overwrought Scandanavian-produced drivel and other purveyors of listless pop sludge that clutter the airwaves.  As a whole, &quot;Fever&quot; is seamless collection of dance/pop gems, some camp, some cheesy but all absolutely delightful.  Anyone who believes otherwise should reevaluate their ability to review music.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Definitely a more mature album than the excellent, 30 million selling Jagged Little Pill, but I have one complaint... Who on Earth decided on that ghastly Frank Zappa Uncle Meat style cover? Even if it was Alanis, it was a mistake.<br />Whether AM likes it or not, her physical beauty is part of the package and several people (female and male) I know felt cheated by this hideous travesty of a cover, which I believe could have cost millions in potential sales. <br />Thankfully the new album, Under Rug Swept, has a cover which evokes the same feel as JLP. If they re-issued Junkie with a decent new cover AND with the track Uninvited, I would buy it again. Hint hint.
B00000K0E5|4.0|I love this movie. I haven't enjoyed a James Bond film as much as this one since Goldfinger. It revamps Bond for the new millenium, making him a bit more of an action hero as well. There are very few things to pick holes in with this ilm. I loved the directing by Martin Campbell (it almsot looks kind of Luc besson-ish), The acting on Pierce's part was amazing, the badguys were pretty bad, and the music by the amazing Eric Serra was stellar. The only thing that is wrong with this flick is it drags a little in parts. When a movie is 2 hours 10 minutes, it's hard to keep every seond of it interesting. This movie does a pretty good job, but it does get a bit boring from time to time, mostly when Bond isn't on screen. If you like your action fast, your cars hot, your women hotter, and your one-liners cheesier, look no further than the best Bond flick yet, Goldeneye.
B000056N8X|5.0|I have to admit, this was the first Highlander I saw, and I thought it was great. After viewing the others, I can see why so many series fans have beef. Essentially, this film tries to clean up all the contradictions and sci fi mumbo jumbo in the other films and concentrate on the characters instead - good move. I would suggest watching this flick and leaving the other films - especially - Highlander II - unwatched.<br />This film highlites interesting character dynamics, the romantic notions of immortality (sort of like is attempted in many bad vampire movies), and some impressive fight choreography. Also, the soundtrack has a wonderful celtic feel. On the whole, I would suggest watching it for the first time with somebody who can fill you in on the basics of the series, but it is most assuredly a worthwhile effort.
B00005QIPH|5.0|No matter what some of you people believe, The Strokes are a nice change to the old predominantly hardcore rock scene. They are an upbeat, fun to listen to group who can put anyone in a good mood. Also, they're all talented and are sure to continue to produce  even better albums ad they fine tune their talents and become more comfortable with the singing/songwriting process.

B00004TRD8|5.0|What can I say? Surely everyone who's fan of the genre has seen the movie several times by now. But the picture is perfect, and the 5.1 surround just RIPS and puts you right in the middle of the action. Many DVD's make rather dissappointing use of surround sound.They need to give this a listen to see how it should be done. My only gripe is the lack of separate French and Spanish language tracks,so I still have the rugular version of the T2 DVD. Languge students take note,DVD's are a great (someimes VERY frustrating) tool for the intemediate student on up,though I'm sure many have discoverd that by now.(And those dreadful Pok&eacute;mon cartoons are much more tolerable with an alternat language track). But as for T2..Listen to me now and hear me later and understand a coupl of weeks ago in the not too distant future..if you don't have the T2 Ultimate Edition DVD, you are quickly relenquishing your right to claim yourself as a fan of the film! (As for Star Wars and Indy Jones, right now I would be as happy as a pig in...uh..you know..for movie-only versions with 5.1 on DVD!!)

0783226063|3.0|Unfortunately, DUNE (and I'm talking about the original theatrical version, not the unauthorized \\"Alan Smithee\\" tv<BR>long version with awful narration and bad edits.) wasn't the<BR>masterpiece that David Lynch and the fans were hoping for,<BR>though I think, after watching the film many, many times,<BR>buying it on VHS Widescreen, and suffering through much of the<BR>scandalously bad, embarrassing Sci-Fi Channel miniseries version<BR>last year, the film holds up better than previously thought.<BR>Sure, it's a Cliff's Notes version of the novel, and a lot <BR>of characters, dialogue are edited out, and Lynch adds new<BR>elements and scenes that don't even appear in Frank Herbert's<BR>novel.  Still I think the film blows away most fantasy films<BR>coming out these days for sheer originality, closeness to<BR>the spirit of the original story, and the work the crew<BR>did on the sets, costumes, and sound design are still awe-<BR>inspiring. <BR>    But even if you still detest this version of Dune, PLEASE<BR>don't mistake the godawful Sci-Fi Channel version miniseries<BR>with the book or the \\"real\\" Dune:  in fact, if you compare<BR>the miniseries with the novel Dune, it has even LESS in common with the book than Lynch's version.  The idiots at Sci-Fi<BR>Channel singlehandedly destroyed Dune.  I'm starting to think<BR>this desecration was done on purpose for some unknown reason.<BR>Many of the characters from the novel are there, but they are<BR>so twisted into camp, comedy versions that it doesn't matter.<BR>The costumes in the Sci-Fi Channel are absolutely godawful,<BR>they have nothing to do with what Herbert's vision of the future<BR>was like.  I mean, the Spacing Guild in Lynch's film LOOK<BR>like the Spacing Guild--in the miniseries they look like bad<BR>versions of the Knights Who Say Ne! from Monty Python and<BR>the Holy Grail.  In the final analysis perhaps Lynch's Dune should have been done at three-hour plus length, whether released theatrically or on television, but minus the hideous narration, but with extra scenes and dialogue intact.  Lynch made decisions like including the non-novel \\"weirding module\\" weapons scenes and he's got to live with those decisions, right or wrong, even though they deviate from Herbert's original storyline.  Still, nothing could be worse than the SF Channel's<BR>grossly inept and insulting version of Dune.  I'm glad Herbert wasn't alive to witness THAT travesty!  Even HE approved Lynch's version of Dune with all the changes and accentuations<BR>that Lynch added.  He knew at least that Lynch was shooting for<BR>authenticity.<BR>    But the SF Channel miniseries the \\"final\\" version of Dune?<BR>Not on your life, not by a longshot.  I believe a solid, serious<BR>adaptation of Dune is possible, but it will take a studio <BR>brave and ambitious enough to mount it responsibly and not flinch<BR>from its epic length and scope.  Yes folks, you CAN write a script that will follow a novel like Dune more closely AND film it in such a way as to not lose the fans along the way.  I promise you it can be done.  I believe that with this short<BR>version of Dune, Universal did the fans a disservice by insisting<BR>on a short version--they let the fans down, they let David <BR>Lynch down, and they let Frank Herbert down.  That the film is still as enjoyable as it is is tribute to the great talents involved.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|I got &quot;Untitled&quot; and all things considered, I do enjoy it a lot. However... some things are missing. Like why not have a list of all the deleted scenes? It's cool having them incorporated on Disk 1, but by watching the trailer, you can see there are some &quot;deleted&quot; scenes still not in &quot;Untitled&quot; -- such as the young William at the Prom, William on the couch getting the guitar taken away... lots of stuff like that.<br />And where's the music video for &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;??? Why was that left out? And so far, of the 3 Easter Eggs found, they are pretty good. But what I really wanted was to see the Patrick Fugit audition tape everyone raves about; and Philip Seymour Hoffman's too. I liked this as a DVD, but obviously, wanted more.
B000002LAC|5.0|When I first heard of this album, I thought, &quot;Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris, I understand, but what the heck is Linda Ronstadt doing on that album?&quot;  Ronstadt has had her dabblings in country and bluegrass-tinged work, but I didn't see how her voice would meld with those of Parton and Harris.  Turns out that Ronstadt grounds the entire album.  As Harris and Parton unleash the crystalline purity of their voices, Ronstadt performs the service of grounding everything with the darker, caramel undertones of her own richer instrument.  The three together work magic on such country classics as &quot;The Pain of Loving You&quot; (co-written by Parton and one-time co-star Porter Wagoner) and Parton's elegiac &quot;Wildflowers.&quot;  Not content to settle for only traditional country tunes, they take on Phil Spector's &quot;To Know Him is to Love Him&quot; and manage to turn this teenage weeper into a reflection on mature love.  Backed up by such greats as Albert Lee and Ry Cooder, this album is the richest of collaborations among musicians at the peak of their powers.
0780021150|1.0|...<br />A wonderful and thought provoking film but what was Criterion doing by releasing this print? The last third of of the film was ruined by a white line across the top of the TV destroying the mood of the film and making it practically unwatchable. Buy at your own risk. At Criterion's high prices print quality should be outstanding.
0316776963|5.0|I wouldn't have believed that David Sedaris could get any funnier, but he has.  With \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" Sedaris strolls down something of an autobiographical lane.  The title story refers to his efforts to learn French in a language class in France (he has inconveniently neglected to learn French before having moved to France with his lover).  From his beginnings as a performance artist (one of his friends specialized in a performance piece that involved the artist being shot in the shoulder with a rifle), Sedaris moves on to moving (see the scathing summations of all the folks he's ever had the bad luck to move, including the woman who had not bothered to pack up a single item before the movers arrived) and other things.  Sometimes he takes a side trip, as when he goes home to visit his father and his sister Amy happens to be there as well.  Amy, who hasn't been home in some time, decides to wear a fat suit the entire weekend.  The effect of the fat suit on Mr. Sedaris is mind-bogglingly funny--he spends the entire weekend trying subtly to get her to eat less, to go out for a quick run--anything to get her to lose weight.  But the best thing by far has to be the classroom full of sundry nationalities, all trying in their crippled French to explain to a Moroccan student what Easter is:<br />\\"It would seem that despite having grown up in a Muslim country, she would have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no.  'I mean it,' she said.  'I have no idea what you people are talking about.'  The teacher called upon the rest of us to explain.  The Poles led the charge to the best of their ability.  'It is,' said one, 'a party for the little boy of God who call his self Jesus and . . . oh, s--t.'  She faltered and her fellow countryman came to her aid.  'He call his self Jesus and then he be die one day on two . . . morsels of . . . lumber.'  The rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pope an aneurysm.  'He die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father.' 'He weared of himself the long hair and after he die, the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples.' 'He nice, the Jesus.' 'He makes the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.'  Part of the problem had to do with vocabulary.  Simple nouns such as 'cross' and 'resurrection' were beyond our grasp, let alone such complicated reflexive phrases as 'to give of yourself your only begotten son.' \\"  Humor writing doesn't get any better than this.
B000002MY3|5.0|7 years after the fact, this album is still an amazing piece of art, a honest and telling reflection of life, hardships, and experiences, as heard through the music of the truly talented Alanis Morissette.  Upon its release in 1995, this album made heads turn, and it continues to do so upon re-listening, over and over again.  These songs are universal, and will always be, going down in rock history as a milestone album, and a milestone artist.  Listen to it again, and you'll remember why you bought this album when it first came out.  If you never did, it's long overdue.
0380799006|5.0|I count myself blessed that my two kids get along swimmingly for about 90% of the time, but my husband and I bought this book when our second child arrived, wanting to be prepared for the worst.  Think of the book as a tool kit.  Faber and Mazlish equip parents with the most effective tools around to help cope with and diffuse sibling rivalry and the havoc it can wreak on a family.  The techniques described herein are useful, pragmatic, and based upon long experience.  I can't recommend the book too highly.
B00005QIPH|4.0|this band has great potential.I would have to compare them to the band who was also out of NYC back in the 60s The Velvet Underground. The strokes bring on a new sound poprock with some punk rock and a little ska in it also when i say punk i mean the clash and ramones not the new emo punk. I love the sound of these guys . the  album is repitive but in a good way to let u know what there sound is i think u will see a lot from these guys. Buy this album it is great !!!
B00005LKHW|1.0|I don't agree with the guy who said people who don't like this movie are straightlaced religious zealots, I don't like this movie and I'm not a straightlaced religious zealot and I'm no prude, In fact two of my favorite movies are Animal House and There's Something About Mary which I personally think are 100 times better than this movie and prudish religious zealots definitely would not like those crass humor movies, I just don't like American Pie because I just think it's not all that funny and it's not very original, it is a clone of all the other Rated \\"R\\" crass humor movies that were made before it and an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of There's Something About Mary which kind of regenerated the market for those types of movies not unlike how the successes of When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless In Seattle brought forward a whole crop of romantic comedies!
B000002UZ4|5.0|This is one of the very best 80's albums ever! I love every song on it and listening to this CD brings me right back to the 80's. This one is a must have for your CD collection. Erasure is by far my favorite band, but this one comes close. Let's see buy this Pet Shop Boys CD, Depeche Mode: The Singles, OMD: The Singles, Erasure: Pop 20, Boy George: Colour By Numbers, B-52's: Cosmic Thing, ABC: Absolutely ABC and you will have a terrific 80's collection! This is one of the best, BEST OF, albums ever!
B00004TH7Z|2.0|It never seemed to me that Iron Maiden were repeating themselves until Bruce left and Blaze got in. Theres not a single original riff or melody on the albums that he sang on, and when Maiden anounced that Bruce and Adrian were back, I was hoping that their creativity would come back with them. I was wrong. Altough &quot;Brave New World&quot; is way better than &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;Virtual XI&quot;, there is nothing new or exciting about it. The songs are just boring and lack lots of imagination. Bruce and Adrian seem to be playing only for the paycheck, and even the songs they wrote (wich are few) sound dated and uninspired. I guess that I better stick to the old albums or the Dickinson solo stuff.

B00005UEAR|3.0|I dont understand these guys. Why the hell do they need Jordan Rudess, John Myung and James LaBrie for? Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci produced the album, wrote most of the lyrics and most of the music while the other guys were set aside as Jason Newsted was in Metallica. When you listen to the first six songs (disc 1) it seems that Petrucci and Portnoy are playing alone, with brief collaborations from Rudess, Myung and LaBrie. Its all heavy guitars and drums. Until you decide to put CD2 on your CD player you dont know if the whole band is there. I guess Rudess and LaBrie are in there only for the paycheck and Myung tries to be a second Jason Newsted, but these people could have done better if they really wanted to. Also, I didnt like the new sound, it reminds me too much of Pantera, Metallica, Tool and Korn. This album should have been titled: &quot;Portnoy &amp; Petrucci: a tribute to a decade of alternative rock&quot;

B00003CXPD|5.0|When you need a pick me up BILLY really delivers!  Beautiful and moving performances by all involved.  The little kid (Jamie Bell) in the lead is absolutely stunning!  The dance scene on the rooftop with his brother watching is unforgetable.  As is the dance scene for his dad in the boxing gym.<br />Billy Elliot is an 11 year old Engish lad who takes boxing classes but really wants to dance ballet with the little girls in the next room of the gym.  He's not posh (as the Europeans call gay men) but a youngster who escapes the hectic world around him by getting lost in his dancing.  Of course, dad and brother think it's sissy.  Luckily a dance teacher notices his gift and helps him move forward despite it all.  Uplifting movie magic with a terrific soundtrack to tap your feet by!<br />By the way, forget about the R rating moms and dads.  Kids should see such a delightful film showing a little boy following his dreams.  Watch along to explain some of the language.  Worth the trouble!!
B000059H99|5.0|The DVD contains 28 minutes of Sylvester Stallone which is worth the price alone.  In addition, you get a commentary from all the actors about the making of the movie.  Even if you don't like the movie, just the commentaries alone are worth the price of the DVD.  These commentaries explain why certain scenes are shot they way they were--mostly because of budget restraints.  If you are a movie buff, the creative process is very interesting. Also, the commentary explains the motivation(s) of each scene which is interesting.
B0000542DJ|5.0|This film marks not only an achievement for Oliver Stone, but for all film. It is no surprise to me that Roger Ebert chose this film as one of his 100 Great Movies, recently published.

A beautiful, touching book everyone of all ages should read. I read it just before I went home to be my mother's caregiver (she had Alzheimer's), and I cried so hard then; and I still can't stop the tears each time I read it. It's a wonderful book for family caregivers to read.
B000007MVX|4.0|Surely Tull's greatest album based on studio indulgences, and comes across like a passionate musical quilt of nifty jazz phrasings and circus music. Let the high-wire fly and the storyline put on a surreal mask. Then plug it into a far-too powerful outlet and hope for the best. <br />The lyrics are slightly, and sometimes very vague, or perhaps just that the meanings are so far from being delived in prose that the storyline fails to be important since the musical bursts and hooks are delivered in a rapid fire method with incredible momentum.<br />This solidifies into a musical and vocal thrill. It soars on some kind of musical high which is the essential thing the listener gets. Energy almost independent of the lyrics, the force of the music carries on like a musicians Ironman competition. <br />The hare.......I agree......having fun is important !!!
6301697707|5.0|Hungry giant worms lay siege on the small town of Perfection, Nevada and its up to Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward to find a way out. Supremely entertaining horror/comedy features an action-packed and frenetically paced second half, plenty of laughs, and great chemistry between Bacon, Ward, and Finn Carter. An all-around excellent genre film and one of the best of its kind. Yes, it's every bit as good as you've heard it is and then some.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B00005KHL0|4.0|The best scary movies are the ones that remember this rule: the less you have to show, the better because the human mind can imagine things far worse than anything on the screen. John Carpenter used to know this and that's the reason that HALLOWEEN is such a success and so much better than the sequels that followed. By then Carpenter was rolling in the dough and forgot his roots. I'm not completely sure why but many first time directors make these awesome pictures on shoe-string budgets then in later years after they are given all the resources and manpower they need, they make nothing but garbage (look what happened to Sly Stone with ROCKY).<br />Anyway, HALLOWEEN is a great horror movie. Granted by the ultraviolent and gore-laden horror films of the present day, the movie seems a bit tame and to some even a little cheesy. However, HALLOWEEN is the father of modern horror (the granddaddy is PSYCHO). The FRIDAY THE 13TH and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and even the SCREAM franchises would be nonexistant if it wasn't for HALLOWEEN.<br />HALLOWEEN is made even more scary because of where it takes place, even after over twenty years since it's initial release, the small town atmosphere of the movie resembles just about any small town or suburb in America. The story revolves around Michael Myers, a man who has been in institutionalized care since murdering his older sister on Halloween night fifteen years ago. On the eve before Halloween, Myers escapes from the institution to return to his hometown to haunt and hunt a high school girl named Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). However, Myers isn't the only one hunting, he's being hunted by his doctor, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance).<br />HALLOWEEN was the film that started Jamie Lee Curtis' career and also made John Carpenter the heir of horror. The film has a believable plot, examining the nature of evil. The movie also has some of the most chilling music of any film of suspense. It's a classic.
B00005K3OT|4.0|What do you get when you cross a bevy of French actors, Steven King's \\"Needful Things\\", and Ice T's rap song \\"I'm your Pusha?\\" Why Chocolat of course! No not the rich, theobromic stuff that your girlfriend craves but might kill your dog, I'm talking about the Juliette Binoche, Johnny Deep flick of similar repute. Set in the 1950's (I wasn't quite sure of the epoch until I saw the fooseball table at the local bar)the movie revolves around the trials and tribulations of a gypsy chocolatier. Stop right there, you say, I am of the male species and enjoy beer and football. Well brother I am with you, and I still enjoyed this movie. What it lacks in obligatory violence and chase scenes it makes up for in deepness of mind and character. The theme is unique, the characters lovable, and it would be hard to finish the movie with feeling pretty good about life. So grab a date, get some marshmellows, and brew up a mean cup of hot chocolate. You'll feel good and will probably gain 10 pounds in the next week, but in the process you might be pleasantly surprised with a movie you had predicted would be just a typical \\"chick flick.\\" Two dark beers raised in the support of the underdog, \\"Chocolat.\\"

6304259093|3.0|City of Angels is the first Crow film I saw; I followed the comic a long time ago, and thought the movie captured the ambiance of human and urban decay with the sets, lighting, and \\"crowfitti\\" slathered all over the place.  I was confused by the change of victim to Draven's son, and it would have helped to know the villian was agorphobic.  The acting was weak; Iggy Pop is as menacing as the recently departed Keith Richards (Whaddaya mean  he's not dead?).  The S&M scenes puzzled me for a while until I realized even something as cruelly intense as pouring boiling wax on a woman's nipples was depersonalized in this setting; it made Draven's thirst for vengence by contrast human, as opposed to the villian who left rubber hooded women to moan in solitary bondage, unconnected to the rest of the world.  My main complaints are the too-predictable, seemingly endless fight between the Crow and his nemesis at the end of the film, but the seeming ease with which he defeats the throwaway minions, and the foregone end of Sara.
0517189542|5.0|The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story.  Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war.   Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women.  It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love.  Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste.  The character I related to the most was Jo.  I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked.  I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things.  I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot.  My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone.  Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.  <BR>  I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older...  This is a great book for teaching these things to children.
B000002HRE|5.0|Being a hardcore Metallica fan, I would say just about anything they do is good.  Personally, I like the slowed down versions just as much.  I feel these are almost better because they have a more hidden motive behind each song which is really cool. The Unforgiven 2 is an awesome song as well... The whole CD is worth that song, even though most of the songs, like all Metallica cds, are good.
B000002G8L|4.0|I played this album to [alot], t'll my college roomate appropriated it permanently.  Great to have it again on cd.  Honestly, I think Eric Clapton the solo artists is WAY overrated.  His material with Cream, Derek and the Dominos, Blind Faith, and Delaney and Bonnie was of a much higher quality.  That said, the guitar playing and pop is still great to listen to.  His US tour of the same year was quite memorable.<BR>Tulsa Time is classic solo Clapton.
B00000JPHD|5.0|There is something about Bela Lugosi's Dracula. Few if any actors ever claimed a character so singularly or portrayed a character so totally as did Lugosi with Dracula. He was Dracula and Dracula was him. Other actors had and will continue to play the role, but they will never come close to \\"being\\" Dracula. Even the classic Stoker novel pales bloodless in comparison to Lugosi's performance -- regardless of what you think of the 1931 Tod Browning film. The film itself is unimportant -- it is Lugosi's engaging and hypnotic performance alone that terrified audiences and captured the imagination and collective unconscious of the world. Lugosi is synonymous with Dracula. Period. He may have believed he was Dracula (as only the BEST actors can do) and thus he made us believe that he was --and indeed he was Dracula. Those eyes, those hands, that voice. They are the stuff of nightmares and erotic dreams. In Lugosi's performance we have one of the few truly sublime moments of film acting ever. Others will play the role (due mostly to the power evoked in the part by Lugosi), but none other will BE Dracula than Bela Lugosi.
B000056JYB|4.0|Cream died a horrible death of egos.  It's easy to see why this group followed similarly.  Ginger, as great as he is, should not have been allowed to join this group, or Winwood and Clapton would have kept going.  I think it's great that we get to hear the jams, as well as classics (Presence of the Lord and Can't find My Way Home), on this set.  If you're a Clapton or Winwood fan, this double disc needs to find a home in your collection.  Still, not quite essential.

B000002JSZ|4.0|For Brian Johnson and the boys, this was probably their peak artistically.  Regardless of how much bigger the tours got, they really hit their peak with Flick of the Switch.  I've always thought of Back in Black, For those about to rock...., and Flick of the Switch as a trilogy as the formulas are almost identical, which is what really makes them enjoyable to listen to.  After this, I think the closest record is their most recent, Stiff Upper Lip.  Bon would be proud, and promply have another drink.
0385484518|4.0|I liked this book because it was based on a true story.

0812550706|3.0|This story of science fiction is woven together with beautiful pieces of trickery, misconception, abuse, and most of all the hearts of innocent children.  This story takes your mind to another place of make believe that people hold in the backs of their minds. The story line is surrounded by this intericate game but not just any game a game of survival that any peron can eventually relate to.<BR>Ender is a human child who is badly taken advantage of by all people surrounding him whether it is for private use or for the good of the people. Ender is a innocent child who goes along with these people (government's) ideas because he knows no better. This selfish government turns this young child an outcast from the start, because he is a third child and looked down upon from some people, who has a beautiful gift of being able to conquer his fears as well as any situation that approaches him.<BR>This story was written with all people in mind. It involves mystery, suspense as well as a little bit of fantasy. I say fantasy due to teh fact that the reader has to use quite a bit of imagination to get the feel of this novel. Some of the things that are involved are a little bit hard to see happening in reality, it does give you a sense of fantasy by how the characters are setup as well as the storyline.<BR>The only problem that I had with this novel was the ideal of abuse that the author used. Ender was mistreated by his own family, so called friends, as well as the government(the institution that we as people are suppose to have fiath in.) Not only was Ender mistreated but the other children as well. I understand that the writer used this technique to make Ender stronger but some of the examples of the way that they treated him was harsh for example not allowing Ender to get close to any other child or causing alot of friction bewteen Ender and the other children.<BR>Overall this stroy was strong willed and very well put together, the author used great imagination and paid great attention to detail.
B00005K9LK|5.0|The first Priest song I ever heard was \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" back in 1982 when it came out. Oh, man...what an introduction to Judas Priest!! At this stage, I was going on 15, and just beginning to open my mind and my ears to heavy metal. I had previously just assumed that Judas Priest and Black Sabbath were total noise, without even hearing anything by them; such was my prejudice.<BR> <BR>The first time I heard \\"YGATC,\\" I was quite surprised at how melodic it was, at well as being heavy. It sure didn't sound like noise to me! My mind slowly started opening, and eventually, I bought the album on vinyl. Now that I have SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE (REMASTERED) on CD, I want to share how I feel about each song on it:<br />\\"The Hellion\\" is a nice slow electric (and instumental) buildup to the fast, smokin' \\"Electric Eye.\\" Rob Halford growls the song out menacingly, his voice going thru a voice synthesizer for an 'electric' feel. \\"Ridin' On The Wind\\" is a total blazing, speed-of-light experience which gets your heart beating FAST; it's the precursor to \\"Freewheel Burning.\\" Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing trade off Stratocaster leads that are sharp enough to cut through marble. One of Priest's fastest songs ever! \\"Bloodstone\\" is THE perfect follow-up to \\"Ridin' On The Wind.\\" It starts with a great slow, but intricate, electric guitar intro which melds into a catchy groove...and then the bass of Ian Hill and the drums of Dave Holland kick in. It's a great mid-tempo metal tune. \\"(Take These) Chains\\" is the one slow song on this album; it's a power ballad that existed even before the term first got into use (with Dokken's \\"Alone Again\\").  Written by the talented-yet-much-maligned songwriter Bob Halligan, Jr, it has been unfairly criticized by many Priest fans as being boring and trite. I say just the opposite: It is the perfect slow number, placed in just the right spot on the album, which provides a nice respite from the faster, heavier tracks before it and the ones tocome after. \\"Pain and Pleasure\\" is a pumped-up mid-tempo song with some coy allusions to S&M.  But then it's the title song, \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" which is an ultra-blistering, ultra-screaming, ultra-muscular, ultra-speed-metal workout. It screams, shrieks, and skids right into \\"You've Got Another Another Thing Comin'\\" which is one of the greatest driving songs ever, and still one of Judas Priest's greatest tunes ever. The guitar solo is to die for. I've heard this song at least a thousand times in my life by now, and I never get sick of it. Next comes \\"Fever\\", which starts off soft (and is slower-paced in general) but it eventually turns into another great song to listen to while driving. \\"Devil's Child\\" is really cool, with a great Strat lead guitar solo and a catchy chorus (\\"I believe you're The Devil/I believe you're The Devil's child\\"). It provided a great end to this album when it was released back in '82. <br />But wait! Now there's more: We now get a previously unreleased song recorded in 1985 during the TURBO sessions, the seven-minute-plus epic love song \\"Prisoner of Your Eyes.\\" Uncharacteristically for a Priest song, it begins with slow, swirling keyboards, and builds gradually into a rare Priest epic (that contains one hell of a beautiful extended guitar solo). Then we get a blistering live version of \\"Devil's Child\\" to finish things off.<br />Putting it simply, SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE is one of the 10 greatest heavy metal albums EVER made. I wish that I could give the Remastered version TEN stars! MOST RECOMMENDED
B00003CXA6|5.0|If for no other reason than his production of GETTYSBURG, Ted Turner deserves to be remembered with thanks by generations of filmgoers to come -- long after everyone has forgotten the flap over colorization.<br />When you think about it, the idea was a natural. Bring together some talented Hollywood actors, a very competent director, and join them with thousands of Civil War re-enactors -- those hardy hobbyists who live to commemorate the War Between the States. No other war film can boast thousands of authentically dressed extras for the many battle scenes. The result is an epic sweep which really gives one an idea what a tragedy the death of 55,000 brave Americans looked and felt like.<br />Because Civil War re-enactors tend to be over 40 and a bit generous of girth, the soldiers may not have looked quite like the gaunt figures captured by the cameras of Matthew Brady. No matter: They more than made up for it in enthusiasm.<br />For the sake of simplicity, we see three parts of the battle. First Union Cavalry General Buford (ably played by Sam Elliott) takes possession of the town of Gettysburg and its adjacent high ground and keeps the battle hot until the infantry arrives. On the second day is the brilliant defense of Little Round Top by Col Chamberlain (played by Jeff Daniels) and his 20th Maine Regiment at the far left of the 20-mile-long Union Line. The climax comes with Pickett's Charge on the third day against the center of the Union Line.<br />We see the action primarily from the point of view of the South. While the commander of the Union forces, General Meade (Richard Anderson), appears in only one short scene, there are numerous meetings between General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) and Robert E Lee (a superb performance by Martin Sheen). We get to meet and know Pickett (Stephen Lang), Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan), and several other members of the Confederate General Staff. On the Northern side, there are all too few scenes with Winfield Scott Hancock, the general who takes the full brunt of Pickett's charge.<br />Since I saw the premiere of this film on TNT in 1993, I have come back to it again and again; and I am particularly happy to have obtained the DVD recently.

B00005K9LN|5.0|For those who may just now be getting into Judas Priest's music-- especially by way of either &quot;Screaming For Vengeance&quot; or &quot;Defenders Of The Faith&quot;-- BRITISH STEEL (1980) may sound like it was recorded in somebody's basement. Maybe it did; however, now Columbia Records has released what us metal-hungry Priest fans have waiting for a long time to get--BRITISH STEEL (REMASTERED)!<br />This CD packs a much fuller, more three-dimensional sound.  It no longer sounds like it was recorded in somebody's basement; now it sounds like Priest is playing right there in your home.  The order of the songs has been changed somewhat. BRITISH STEEL now begins with the fastest, heaviest, and probably the best track: the speed-metal &quot;Rapid Fire.&quot; Even though 22 years of metal, grunge, and 'nu-metal' has gone by since it was recorded, this fast-riffing metal workout remains strong to this day. I love the way Halford raises his voice into a scream at the end, and just holds his scream till he can't hold it anymore! It's just another example of why he's one of rock's greatest vocalists ever. &quot;Metal Gods&quot; still succeeds &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;--as well as it should be, as &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; just naturally goes right into the mid-tempo groove of &quot;Metal Gods.&quot; The two-and-a-half-minute ode to fun and criminal mischief &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; comes next. One of only two singles that were released from this album, it's a steady rocker hooks you from beginning to end. I still never tire of hearing it. &quot;United&quot; is a classic slow Priest anthem, very much in the style of their later &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith.&quot; Hearing it now in the wake of September 11th, I think that it would make a perfect anthem for American solidarity. What do you think?<br />The CD continues with another steady rocker, the intelligently rebellious &quot;You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise.&quot; Despite the long title, it's a straightforward rocker that has a lot to say in favor of being in one's youth. &quot;Living After Midnight,&quot; as I'm sure you all know, was the big single from this album (I believe that it briefly cracked the American Top 50). It still rocks hard today, and remains one of us Priest fans' most loved tracks to date. For years, it was one of JP's three concert encores--the others being &quot;Hell Bent For Leather&quot; and &quot;You've Got Another Thing Comin'--and I believe that they still close their shows with these same songs. &quot;The Rage&quot; and &quot;Steeler&quot; are pretty cool tunes to round out the album--but wait, there's more: In this Remastered edition of BRITISH STEEL, we now get the previously unreleased studio track &quot;Red, White &amp; Blue&quot; which Judas Priest had recorded in 1985 during the TURBO sessions. Although it's actually dedicated to the colors on the flag of the United Kingdom, not the United States, I can see how it could become a great American anthem as well. It's quite an emotional and moving song. We also get a hot live version of &quot;Grinder,&quot; which is a great track to end this excellent CD. I give BRITISH STEEL (REMASTERED) five stars for both content and for sound. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is only the second Jane Austen book that I have read, but certainly not the last! Though the numerous characters and complex sentences provide the reader with a challenge and requires some concentration, the end result is definitely rewarding. Complicated characters and complicated relationships leave the reader constantly on their toes, and you never know what to expect next. What's so wonderful about this book is that the characters are so real. There are so many memorable characters in this story about Mrs. Bennet attempting to marry off her five daughters, and these characters aren't perfect, merely human, making them easy to relate to as well as laugh at. In reading this book, you see yourself in the same tough situations and awkward moments as them and realize that we sometimes forget that we don&iexcl;¦t have to be flawless. Everyone is proud and prejudiced at sometime or another; we aren't perfect, and it's okay!<br />Though perhaps an easier read than Emma, Pride and Prejudice is similar in that it is also full of the same brilliant dialogue and subtle humor. This book is great for anyone who is interested in a romantic comedy that will that twirl you around with its genius and surprises.
B000001F6N|5.0|So how could anyone have ever replaced a guitarist like Eric Clapton and still mantain their popularity? John Mayall did it by hooking up with an even better guitarist. His name: Peter Green.<br />A Hard Road is just another milestone for John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, and for the blues in general because it gave Britain at large their first look at the man the man they called &quot;better than God&quot;, God being Eric Clapton.<br />There are obviously two men who dominate the recording; John Mayall and Greeny. (Though the rhythm section of John McVie and Aynsley Dunbar is exceptional) Without a doubt Mayall is the dominant figure here. He shows much more development and improvement as a musician than on the previous album. As for his vocals, well, what can you say about someone with a voice so soulful? This is a step backwards in terms of songwriting, but when you made such great songs on your previous albums it ain't gonna be easy to do better on 'em.<br />Then there's Greeny. He was good, but he could have been better. One thing that made the Beano album so great was that Clapton wasn't afraid to show off his abilities as a guitarist. Here, however, Green seems a little shy and content to keep the rhythm for Mayall. (With an exception in the Green-instrumental Supernatural, in which he plays with pure venom) Nevertheless he certainly shows his abilities as a songwriter, and his ability to make a normal blues songs great. When he formed Fleetwood Mac he would prove why he is a better guitarist than Clapton.<br />Bottom Line if you are looking for great British blues, or just great blues in general, then A Hard Road is a nice addition. While you're at it buy Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton, and an album by Cream or the Original Fleetwood Mac. If you're a blues album they'll be the sugar in your coffee.

0790740443|4.0|Kurt Russell barely says a hundred words in Soldier. There are no catchy one-liners to diminish his performance; he says only what is necessary and it always ends with 'Sir!'. Soldier is a cruel extrapolation of the the military's destruction of individuality. Here, soldiers are as disposable as tissues when something better comes along. <BR>Russell's performance in this movie is endlessly fascinating! His face and body language express more than any dialogue could, allowing the viewer to take as much emotional depth as he or she would have. It is interesting to find that as one tunes into this near-silent performance, one can find much more depth in the performances of the other actors in the film. If you don't want to delve into the emotional avenues of this film there are some great action sequences to keep the pace moving, including a fight with our hero and our antagonist high up on chains!<BR>The violence here is graphic. Not many punches are pulled by the director, although the commentary makes it clear that he did not go as far as he wanted.  The violence is not gratuitous though. To understand our hero we must see where he came from, and that is a cold and fearsome place. <BR>I wish there were more extra features in this DVD. It only comes with a trailer and a commentary. The guys are interesting though, balancing technical aspects of the film with little bits about the actors and what they all went through during filming.<BR>I highly recommend this movie for fans of Kurt Russell, action, sci-fi and good storytelling. Thank you Paul Anderson!
B000002AHC|5.0|By 1968 it looked like the end was near for the Byrds.  David Crosby and Michael Clarke were causing great internal problems within in the band and people knew it was only a matter of time before the band would completely explode.  Crosby was drifting away from the band musical as he got into the hippie culture in the meantime Michael Clarke was just losing interest in being in the band completely for he disliked most of the songs on this album.  However despite the dwindling morale The disgruntled folk rock greats managed to make what is considered one of their best albums.  Although it was not exactly a hit on the charts (peaking at a mere #52) The Notorious Byrd Bros. may be the band finest hour!<br />Now the songs on the Notorious Byrd Bros. are not the greatest alone but together they are wonderful and perhaps the defining moments of American music during the Vietnam war.  Often I say this album is like an American Sgt.Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.  The album contains some beauiful songs lie GOIN' BACK which makes one long for their childhood years, DRAFT MORNING which discusses the horrible feeling of having to go to war, GET TO YOU which is a love song that tells about I guy travelling miles just to get to his love.  The album includes several hippie anthems too such as the horn power rock of ARTIFICIAL ENERGY, the talk about the politcal and social unrest in CHANGE IS NOW, the loving touch of NATURAL HARMONY, and the paranoid mood of TRIBAL GATHERING.  <br />WASN'T BORN TO FOLLOW is a tune about nature that appeared in the film \\"EASY RIDER\\" As for OLD JOHN ROBERTSON and SPACE ODDYSSEY well they are just experimental novelty tunes with a touch of moog.<br />The bonus tracks are pretty interesting.  MOOG RAGA is a nice piece of spaced out sixties music and BOUND TO FALL is a great rock instrumental.  Their are also alternate versions of GOIN' BACK and DRAFT MORNING which are a nice listen but cannot replace the originals.  UNIVERSAL MIND DECODER is just aninstrumental of CHANGE IS NOW with a spiffy name but the real treat to that track is listening to the band members bicker at eachother it's down right hilarious!  However the real stand out bonus track is David Crosby's TRIAD which was left off the album because of it's message perhaps, but the album would have been better had they included this delightful masterpiece.<br />The Byrds proved once again that they could make awesome music under difficult pressure.  However unfortunelty the band's time was just about up, David Crosby was fired during the sessions for this album and went on to form Crosby Stills And Nash while Michael Clarke left the group less than a month afterwards therefore leaving only McGuinn and Hillman to assemble a new Byrds.  <br />In conclusion I believe The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the groups best album.  Why? because it's versatile, diverse and very trippy and it also delivers several wonderful messages.  It is nothing less than an American Sgt.Peppers LHCB and although the songs may not be terrific alone (with the exception of GOIN' BACK and WASN'T BORN TO FOLLOW) together they formed an awesome masterpiece that changed music forever!  Highly recommended!
0743224345|3.0|Finally, the star is here!!! Or so I thought.<br />For a long time, GMAT takers, especially the high-scorers, were thirsting for really good questions to work with. Kaplan, the #1 test prep company, has now come-up with this excellent book for the advanced preparation. However, there is more hype to the text than reality.<br />This book covers all the question types from the CAT sections of GMAT. In my opinion, the coverage for Critical Reasoning, Reading Comprehension, Problem Solving and Data Sufficiency is barely sufficient. The only saving grace of the book is the examples related to sentence correction. <br />In general, there are about 321 questions in the book (A steal - compared to $99 which Kaplan charges for 500 question bank). The break-up is - 35 Critical Reasoning, 12 Reading Comprehension Passages with 4 questions each, approximately 60 Problem Solving questions, 38 Data sufficiency questions and about 110 sentence correction. All the questions are explained well. However, the book is filled with pseudo-reasons about why the question is considered to be tough. There are, in addition,  general tips throughout the book for adapted to give the additional edge needed for an 800 scorer. <br />Since this is the first edition, there are, expectedly, a few typos and formatting errors. That should not stop you on your march to the perfect score.<br />All in all - give it a try, if you wish, you 800-SCORERS!!!
B00003CXAA|2.0|Though I am not the slightest bit Italian, I thought these movies were a little ethnically offensive. Not to mention the fact that nothing interesting ever really happened. I have seen these movies many times and honestly cannot quote a single line from any of them. My son Herb loves this series but I think he is just being plain silly, SILLY! I say put your money towards something a little more worthwile - like the new blockbuster smash &quot;Snowdogs&quot; - I have already seen that one 5 times!

B00005QZ7U|5.0|After reading some of the reviews posted here I guess it's true when they say that you'll either love or hate this movie.  I'm definitely in the &quot;love&quot; category.  I think to truly appreciate this movie you have to let go of some preconceptions you might have about musicals or period pieces.  This movie plays outside of any boundaries or genres you'll try to put it into.  That will definitely frustrate a lot of people who want to put it in a box and label it.  I was absolutely entranced by everything in this movie.  The visuals, the music, and especially the performances by Nicole and Ewan are all so full of energy and life that I couldn't help but have a stupid grin on my face through most of the movie.  I think it's fairly safe to say there's not another film out there like this one.  Definitely one to add to your collection.

More melodic than it's thunderous forerunner, Nothing's Shocking, the Amazon \\"house\\" review couldn't be further off the mark when it states that \\"3 Days\\" is overlong.

0553288105|5.0|I read this book more than 25 years ago, and it still resonates with me as one of the best books by Asimov. \\"The Gods Themselves\\" is part of a quote by Schiller, that roughly goes,<br /><br />\\"Folly, thou conquerest, and I must yield!<br />Against stupidity the very gods<br />Themselves contend in vain. Exalted reason,<br />Resplendent daughter of the head divine,<br />Wise foundress of the system of the world,<br />Guide of the stars, who are thou then, if thou,<br />Bound to the tail of folly's uncurb'd steed,<br />Must, vainly shrieking, with the drunken crowd,<br />Eyes open, plunge down headlong in the abyss.\\"<br /><br />It is from the Maid of Orleans. If you read the book, you will see why Asimov chose the quote by Schiller for his title.<br /><br />Read the other reviews. There is near unanimity of opinion about this book. Five stars all the way.

B000000H7I|5.0|You want to talk about brutal technical death? You better not have a conversation about it without Suffocation coming up. This album showed all the bands how its done. Cryptopsy and Immolation learned all their tricks from Suffocation and this album still shows what can be accomplished in death metal. The vocals are of course god-like, the music is fast, brutal, and technical and oh god all I have to say is you SHOULD own it already but if you dont buy it already! The best song are \\"Liege of Inveracity\\" and \\"Jesus Wept\\"
0312243022|3.0|I agree completely with Michelle McSweeney's review -- Cunningham has simply imitated Woolf's great novel in some chapters and, although he writes well, has failed to give us anything extraordinary in the other chapters, although they are intermittently engaging. The book contains no insights that Woolf had not already provided 75 years ago, and it certainly achieves nothing new.  I found the &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; chapters, which just replicate the original with different names and places, plain irritating. Also irritating was the heavy-handedness of such events as Laura Brown's afternoon in a room of her own . . . <br />Just read Woolf's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and call it a day!
B00000JCOV|4.0|This album still has some classic songs but they improved so much on IOWA that it is not even funny. I wish this album still had &quot;Purity&quot; on it which is one of the best songs but it is not. &quot;Me Inside&quot; is a pretty good replacement but not quite as good. The best song on this cd is (sic) which is just a really awesome song. If your gonna buy only one slipknot cd I would say buy IOWA it is much better.
0312119038|5.0|This is the true story of the author's adolescense told in her own words. It is well-written and an engaging read. It tells the story of how the author joined a convent and the nuns turned out to be these (not-so-repressed) sadists, who went out of their way to make her life hell in order to teach her \\"submission\\" to Christ. So much for the story.<br />The hard part is in separating the author from the writing. The author speaks purely from her own perspective. There's no historical context added to help the reader understand what was happening in England of the late 50's and early 60's that would make joining a convent seem like a reasonable choice. The author doesn't really explain, for example: WHY did she join a convent? Was it rebellion? Conformity? Insanity? How did her commitment to complete and utter submission become so total? How could Vatican II have not seemed to touch her life?<br />So, that's what I have to say about the structure of the story: it's good, but it also reads a little like a Judy Blume book -- outside of all historical and social context.<br />But then there's also the author (it is an auto-biography after all). Actually this book reminds me of 2 other autobiographical books I have read: The Accidental Office Lady by Laura Krista (I think) and Wasted by Marya Hornbacher. In all three of these books, young women make these drastic decisions (one to become a nun, one to go work in Japan, and the third becomes anorexic). Then they stick to their guns, just to prove that they can stick to their guns.<br />In other words, these books leave me asking: why? Why do women in the 20th century need to prove themselves by picking some far-flung image of femininity (utter submission for 2 of them and utter thinness for the third) and then nearly destoying themselves to fullfill these images. What is it about our society that makes us look ridiculous when we stand up and say \\"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? This is ridiculous and destructive!\\"<br />So, those are some of the thoughts that I had while reading this book..... you cheer for her when she defends herself against the sadistic nuns, but then, sadly we (females) identify with her when she beats herself over the head for failing to be submissive enough....<br />It's a sad spiral.....are some of the thoughts that I had while reading this book..... you cheer for her when she defends herself against the sadistic nuns, but then, sadly we (females) identify with her when she beats herself over the head for failing to be submissive enough....<br />It's a sad spiral.....
B00005ASGG|5.0|My favorite Western.  An endlessly fascinating and tragic look at the American West, the evolution of legends, the nature of courage, the nature of love plus John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart too. Not to mention a snarling Lee Marvin as the villian Libery Valance <br />When this movie came out, some critics complained that Wayne and Stewart were too old for their roles. Critics also complained that the film looked studio bound.  Later critics made much of the cynical newspaper publisher at the end of the movie who says \\"This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\"  Through the lens of 60's anti-heroism, these critics saw Ford's film as being about the debunking of all heroic American legends. <br />Director John Ford knew exactly what he was doing. He eschewed the grand expanses of Monument Valley for the cramped back lot.  He chose Wayne and Stewart because they were icons of the brave action hero and the law abiding community leader.  He made these choices because he was making a stylized dirge to a frontier west where the code of facing your rival directly with a Colt .45 had given way to the complications of lawyers and lawbooks.<br />After countless viewings of this movie, I am not so sure Ford was being all that cynical, either.  At least not in the way the debunkers want to make him out to be. <br />To me, the heart of this movie is an ultimate act of tragic romantic heroism and not cold political cynicism. The critics who focus on lawyer Stewart's physical confrontation with the villian, Libery Valance, and Stewart's later rise to political fame shortchange the second major conflict in the film. <br />Can a cowardly act ever be courageous?  For Liberty Valance also tells the story of a man of honor who loves a woman very, very much. And then, one day, she asks him to do that one thing that goes against his own moral code.  He thought he was strong enough to live with it.
0441172717|2.0|The main reason i picked up this book was because i'd heard it praised as Science-Fiction's-Crowning-Achievement. more than a few sci-fi fanatic buddies of mine found this book the dune series frighteningly addictive. they would say things like \\"i just got the 6th dune book!\\" while jumping up and down excitedly. one of the best sci-fi authors around, Arthur c. Clarke, even compared Dune to The Lord of the Rings.<br />sadly, at least for me, dune wasn't all it was cut out to be.<br />if not downright awful, Dune is _certainly_ no LOtR.  LOtR has characters, history, rich cultures, awesome landscapes, and above all the vivid imagination of a smart, meticulous man behind it.<br />okay, so frank herbert was probably meticulous, considering he had to create the simply massive amount of politics found in Dune.  is all the political junk why i gave the book 2 stars?  not quite. politics don't thrill me, but they don't bore me to tears either.  unfortunately, for some reason Herbert's endless, tiring banter did.<br />after some deliberation (after all, i hesitate to call an alleged Masterwork a piece of [junk] until i've thought about the reprecussions of such a statement.) ... i've come up with a theory to explain why Dune was so frustrating to read.<br />as the novel progresses, i found myself assaulted by a seemingly endless barrage of events, one taking place right after the other with no warning. <BR>although this style is similar to LOtR, and many fantasy/sci-fi works, what is so disheartening about Dune is that the events are not explained thoroughly. sure, Herbert offers a paltry excuse for why the Atriedes and the Harkonnens hate each other, and he tries to summarize why the Emperor wants to kill the Fremen, but his answers lack depth. they don't make sense. <br />I'm not sure about others, but when something doesn't make sense to me, i don't believe it.  plausibility makes good fiction.  <br />inevitably, someone will call me an idiot for not understanding the socio-economic reprecussions of spice production, but this isn't entirely true.  i understand it superficially, but herbert doesn't give me enough facts or history or first-hand accounts for me to gain a real understanding of his world.  it's almost as though he assumed the reader could see inside of his head, something which we certainly can not.<br />even more disappointing is that Arrakis had SUCH potential--a desert culture more extreme than any on Earth, a desperate people, a royal feud...<br />sadly Herbert is so fixated on propagating stereotypes (Baron Harkonnen, the fat evil homosexual pedophile...Paul Atriedes, the young handsome messiah who can see into the future...shall i vomit now?...) and stuffing in as much action and politics as possible that he takes no time to develop the culture, the languages, the history, the characters...all of the things that would make sludging through 550 pages of political maneuvering worthwhile.<br />the result: i found myself reading on in a hurry, even skipping over sentences, to get to the good part that i could feel coming. unfortunately, none came, and i ended up feeling disappointed and more than a little betrayed.  <br />best piece of science fiction ever written?  c'mon, i'm sure sci-fi can do better than Dune.

B00005ASOC|3.0|It's a good tiny movie a la &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; or &quot;Lean on Me&quot; wave. A lot of fuzz has been spread about it. Indeed Rob Brown does a good job with it, being this his first movie ever, but Sidney Poitier or Morgan Freeman he ain't. Let's wait and see how he grows, possibly also on stage as well as on camera, to see if he's really worthy to be called an actor. F. Murray Abraham does a good job, but doing what? What he has always been doing, the bad, sadistic and twistedly jealous mentor. Wouldn't it be refreshing to see him do something totally whacky just for once? I felt he was wasted once again by the movie machinery...<br />Connery is always good in whatever he does, but at times this bothers me, because he could do much better still. In this one, produced by him, he rather prefers to lean back and watch others work. I simply can't see him as a weak character. His true stamina and adrenalin is always overcooking. I could've seen an older William Hurt playing Forrester, but Connery? He has too much power and life in him that simmers through every pore of his skin to be a poor, isolated, secluded and frustrated writer.<br />He was far better in &quot;The Rock&quot; and in &quot;Entrapment&quot; than in this high-minded intellectual work. I could see it played on stage, but for a movie it's too little. I couldn't sense the immense struggle that both men had to go through in order to win the world. Still it's watchable, but a far cry from &quot;Dead Poets' Society&quot; or &quot;Lean on Me&quot;...
B0000048CX|4.0|This CD has everything the other YLT CD's lack; melody, energy, a sense of humor, wit, and heart.  I don't understand why their other CD's can't be this good.  The rest of their catalogue is interminably drony, lackadaisical, ironic; they sound like they don't care if they're making a record or not and don't want to make an effort either way.<br />Here, they sound alive, funny, and committed to making music. Their cover of &quot;Speeding Motorcycle&quot; is the best one, hands down.  &quot;Emulsified&quot; is a riot. &quot;Yellow Sarong&quot; is the perfect evocation of the psychedelic 60's. Even their cover of the Kinks &quot;Oklahoma, USA,&quot; though it doesn't hold a candle to the original, is full of heart and honesty.<br />This is a great CD, in short.  Why don't they approach their own music with this kind of joy and conviction? I don't know.  I bought four Yo La Tengo CD's in an effort to see what all the fuss was about, and after giving them all a fair try and keeping them around for a year, this is the only one that I can honestly say I like.  And to be fair, I like it a lot.<br />This is probably the only Yo La Tengo CD you'll ever need.  And you do need it, if you like good pop music.
B00003CXXI|5.0|A very charming funny portrayal -both a spoof of fairy tales and a fairy tale in itself.<br />There where some particularly memorable moments and this together with the great humour ,animation,acting and music is what makes it great  , and provides so much originality that the simple plot doesn't matter in the least.<br />All the characters where great -Shrek (Mike Myers) ,the Donkey (Eddy Murphy with his unmistakeable spunk) ,Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the evil Lord Farquarson but so was the portrayal of the minor characters , many of whom where famous tales from many Fairy Tales-including a Ginger Bread Man who had been cruelly maimed by Lord Farquarson and an incorrigible French-accented Robin Hood and his band of thieves.<br />I loved the subplot of the romance between the donkey and the girl-dragon ,especially the scene near the end where they play the Leonard Cohen classic 'Hallelujah ' flashing from a moping Shrek to the Princess to the Donkey visiting the love-sick dragon and putting their romance  into place.<br />I thought the dragon was a particularly delightful, character though she didn't actually talk.<br />The music at the end was also delightful ,with the Who's Who of Fairy Tales participating in the singing and dancing at the end to some well known  pop hits .
0679735909|5.0|Read A.S. Byatt's `Possession' is one of the highest challanges a reader can face. The novel is wonderful, but very demanding, not only because its length but also its structure. I had to read it twice in order to get better all the references and magic of Byatt's work and I still have the feeling that I'm missing many things.<br />To put in a nutshell the novel is the story of two British academics, who study two late poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. After finding some never seen letters of these writers, the scholars discover a secret love affair between the poets and start to investigate it and its consequence their lives and works. It is hard to classify this novel: it is part a drama, part a thriller and much of an analyze of the sexual behaviour of the Victorian Era and the `80s.<br />To begin with the title, the word `possesion' allows many interpretations related to the novel. One of the academics, Roland, who is the first to find and steal Ash's letters says he was possessed when he did it. Another good explanation is that he and the other academic. Maud, are so `possessed' by the late poets that they revive the love affair. Or the word `possession' refers to love itself: being in love is being possessed by some unknown entity. Ash says many times he was possessed by something he didn't know when in love with LaMotte. Possession may also be related to the obsession that all the academics can have to their object of study. All of them in the novel go deeper in the poets' lives than in their own, mainly Croppe. There are some other explanation that anyone can come up with after reading the novel. All of them can be right, all can be wrong.<br />As a modern work as it is, `Possession' allows many interpretations and conclusion. Byatt's wrtinting is very semitotic: everything is related to everything. Acts from the past still have effect in the present time. Things that the poets did in the XIX century, interferes in the life of people in the late XX.<br />Another effective technique used by the author is the interrelationship of verse and prose. More than creating two characters who are poets, Byatt created their work. One can read many verses and tales written by these poets through the novel, and their meaning and  importance are in a higher level. Their works are clues to understand their lives and their affair. And, yes, Byatt is this good. She can created verses as good as her prose and so different that one may doubt they were written by the same person. By the way, these kind of writing reads a bit hard at first, but once you get uesd to it, it is very pleasant to have many different sources as poems and letters than the plain narrative as usuall. The poets' letters are very vivid and beautiful, it is impossible not to be touched by their relationship and feel sorry for all the problems they have to face.<br />The comtemporany characters are very well developed also. Roland and Maud are the ones who face the most drastically change. Not only all the work they have developed about Ash and LaMotte have to change, but also their own private lives faces a challenge. The other three main academics, Croppe, Leonora and Blackadder, also see their working falling down. These characters are very realistic: it is not hard to find people who spent their whole lives devoted to study one single subject that they become obsessed to it.<br />Byatt's prose is insightfull and discriptive. Colours have an mayor role through the narrative. She uses many shades of colours just to give to the reader the right feeling of the moment, particularly  green, that seems to be associated to the female pole of the novel. The sexual tension between the characters is very subtle. The differences between the Victiorians and the XX Century people is very thin, although we think we can point it out easily. Byatt's shows we still share some of the same doubts and fears that were so common in the other century.<br />All in all, `Possession' is possessive. It is impossible not to fall for Byatt's writing and characters. After finishing the novel you got the actuall sense you've read a true story. It is impossible to believe that Ash and LaMotte have never been alive and lived that deep love affair.Possession' is possessive. It is impossible not to fall for Byatt's writing and characters.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The picture quality is sharp and in excellent color. There are several tracks of commentary. The sound is as clear and impressive as it can be. The special features are outrageous, sometimes as funny as the film itself. There is a contemperary documentary on the film, trailers, a look back at the locations of the film, new spoofs, and some rather odd features, such as a bit of Japanese language footage and a version of &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; in - Lego? This dvd set is crammed to the gills with bonus goodies, but the core material of the dvd, that is, the movie, is itself excellently tranferred and done with obvious care and concern. <br />This may be heartily recommended to anybody who enjoys Monty Python, and is also recommended as an upgrade from the old dvd version.
0780020685|5.0|Even though this movie was very long, it kept me riveted with its excellent acting and even better storyline.  A must have for any movie collection.
6305013578|5.0|Amazon is lumping reviews of every possible edition of Metropolis together. What a shame, since the truely unwatchable (Madacy, Koch, etc) are being lumped together with the divine (Kino).<br /><br />So, let's make this simple. Get the most recent Kino release, \\"The Complete Metropolis\\", preferably on Blu-Ray. AVOID any other version, as they are simply too horrible for words, nearly unwatchable prints with terrible and unrelated soundtracks added on. (I';m completely ignoring the Morodor version here, by the way. I figure it is it's own piece of work, and does not matter here.)<br /><br />The most recent restoration, done in 2010, is as profound a revelation as the 2001 restoration was. The addition of newly found (and terrible quality) material from Argentina has completed the story and tied together a fair number of loose ends that were evident in the film. It is amazing to see how a 5 second shot can completely change the context and meaning of a whole sequence, and how much more dramatic the escape of the children from the underground city is. The soundtrack is now perfectly matched to the action, and all but one important sequence are in place.<br /><br />The picture quality is superb, and the transfer is very nicely done. The restoration team made some very good choices in presenting the material in a way that lets the film flow, but also shows the limits of restoration of some of the material.<br /><br />The movie still has plot holes you could drive a truck through, and the acting still varies from good to awful, but the sum of the parts makes these problems seemingly wither away. It is now much easier to get swept away by this film.
B00005MP58|5.0|Excellent.  Lovely.  This version of the miniseries had colors in it that I hadn't seen before, even on the VHS or the earlier DVD.  I was a little disappointed in the amount of behind the scenes footage, but it was still far superior to the previously released DVD.
020161622X|5.0|The most challenging thing that I have to overcome as a developer is to make the most use of all the tools that I have acquired from reading technical books and papers. Most of the time, I find that I know how to do something, but I need a push in the right direction to show me what is achievable with my skills.<br />This book doesn't teach you how to create X using Y. It doesn't tell you how to write sort algorithms or develop asynchronous messaging systems. It makes the daring assumption that you already know how to do all that type of stuff. Instead, it teaches you how to rearrange your skills into a more efficient and inspiring toolset.<br />The most important thing to ask yourself is not &quot;What do I know&quot; but instead, &quot;What is possible&quot;. This book lays out a framework for thinking more in these terms without concerning yourself with the minor details that can be looked up in a book.<br />I hate to borrow from the old &quot;Teach a man to fish...&quot; story but I have to say, I'm catching fish all over the place!
0792844882|4.0|Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) has just arrived in Las Vegas, hitching a ride with a truck driver named Jeff who listens to Garth Brooks. She is a dancer, she tells him. She is also a drama queen. When he not altogether surprisingly steals her suitcase, she punches a random car with her fist, attempts to punch the random car's owner, runs into the road and is almost mowed down, vomits and finally sinks gratefully into the random car's owner's arms. In the space of about ten seconds. The car owner's name is Molly (Gina Ravera). She is the only nice person in the movie, which is never a good thing to be in a movie like this. She says that Nomi can stay with her if she wants, and so six weeks later Nomi is happily living with Molly in a trailer by day and making her money as a lapdancer at the Cheetah club by night.<br />Molly works behind the scenes at 'Goddess', the dance extravaganza at the Stardust Hotel. One day she takes Nomi along with her to meet the girls and watch the show, and this is when the story really begins. Enter Cristal Connors (Gina Gershon), head showgirl, who bursts into the movie in an appropriate way - rather than coming through a door or anything mundane like that, she bursts naked out of a glittering gold volcano in a whoosh of fire and spangles, while the other dancers on the stage peel off their clothes and simulate copulation in awe.<br />Cristal is by far the most interesting character in the script, and Gershon's performance is perfect - she realises the fun and nonsense of the situation and camps it up. Cristal ends every drawling sentence with the word \\"darrrrrlin'\\", ... Nomi, on the other hand, lusts for Zach (Kyle Maclachlan), Cristal's boyfriend/stage manager at the Stardust.<br />Well, Nomi gets herself on stage alongside Cristal in 'Goddess', and that's pretty much the storyline. This is a wonderful movie. It's something along the lines of a daytime soap opera crossed with a [B type] movie, with a healthy dose of drag queen eye make-up and energetic, wiggling dance routines. On one level, it's pure camp. Gershon has an inordinate amount of fun as she licks her lips and woos Nomi with lines like, \\"You are a ..., darrrlin'.\\" Winning. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Berkley delivers a performance straight out of 'Days Of Our Lives'. She takes off her jacket, dramatically; storms out of rooms, dramatically; and even manages to eat fries dramatically. Which is pretty much the perfect performance for this movie.<br />Underneath the glitter, this movie is a cold satire of American culture. 'Showgirls' is also almost a remake of 'All About Eve', but porny - although having said that, after about five minutes you stop noticing that there are naked ladies everywhere. There are quite a few in-jokes too - Nomi dances/strips at the Cheetah Club to Prince's \\"319\\", and later on in the movie, Cristal's room number is... well, you guessed it. And check out the scene where Nomi sits, gazing wistfully into the distance, in front of a huge fake version of the Sphinx. She also sits and blissfully watches a flashing neon sunset. Many people saw this as a huge mistake on director Paul Verhoeven's part. Perhaps what they didn't realise is that this was exactly what he was aiming for.
B000060K4O|5.0|\\"Ghostbusters\\" will always remain an 80's classic. The interactive menus are awesome and the visual effects features that take you behind the scenes are my favorite part of the whole disc. Too bad the above average sequel was overlooked for a decent polish.
0790738139|5.0|\\"LA Confidential\\" can confidently be called the mother of all film noirs; Lord help whoever tries to top this one.  Set in Los Angeles in the early 1950s, \\"Confidential\\" deals with an incredible case of police corruption which is unearthed little by little as the dead bodies pile up.  There are so many terrific performances in this movie (Kevin Spacey as the jaded vice cop, Russell Crowe as the Rambo wannabe, Guy Pearce as the straight-arrow lieutenant, James Cromwell as the venal police captain, and Kim Basinger as the call girl with a heart) that they would have had to hand out Oscars by the bucketful to do justice to everyone who deserved one.  Of the minor characters, my favorite was Danny DeVito as the sleazeball sleaze magazine editor, whose talent for telling all finally does him in.  There are a few real-life characters being played in this film; who in the baby-boomer set doesn't remember Johnny Stompanato, the small-time thug and sometime paramour of Lana Turner who was murdered by her daughter, which was ultimately dismissed as justifiable homicide?  The main characters in the film are so compelling as to be totally mesmerizing.  Lieutenant Exley, played by Guy Pearce, tries earnestly to steer a straight path through the miasma of corruption running rampant in his precinct, even as he boosts his own career through rampant self-promotion.  Kevin Spacey is great as Seargeant Jack Vincennes, who is mired so deep in the vice squad that he is becoming as jaded and venal as the human slimeballs he mixes with, until he stumbles onto the key players of the corruption within the LAPD, and James Cromwell practically oozes evil as the loathesome Captain Dudley Smith.  But the film really belongs to Russell Crowe and his portrayal of Officer Bud White; with his take-no-prisoners mentality, he seems to represent everything that is wrong with the LAPD (vicious, corrupt, violent, insensitive); but with White there is a limit, and when he stumbles into the rot in his department, his better instincts take over.  There is blood and gore galore in this film but the story is so well told that none of the violence is gratuitous.  It's a story of people doing a mean, dirty job with honor or dishonor.  This movie defines film noir as it has never been defined before, and it ranks as one of the greatest films of the past decade.  The acting, directing and production can only be described in superlatives.  It's a winner on all counts.artment, his better instincts take over.

B000001DTM|5.0|U2 threw their arms around the world, and we welcomed their transformation from the anthemic every-man band to a seedier and darker version that seemed almost self-mocking of its own superstardom. The change resulted in songs fuelled by thick, club-styled beats, Bono's ever emotive vocals and The Edge's masterful guitarwork. Kudos go out to Larry and Adam also! U2 truly crafted one of the 1990's 'landmark' cd's. They've never bettered their weary ode to love of \\"One\\" while the jarring opening guitar riffs of \\"Better Than The Real Thing\\" and \\"The Fly\\" signalled a fresh and exciting U2 for the new decade. When the world changed, its biggest band changed along with it. Everyone's got their favourite U2 record; this is mine.
0345413377|5.0|This has to be the best book in the world! I'm 12 years old now and I loved this seris so much I just didn't want it to end. This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. Phillip Pullman still stands as my favorite author. People get everthing from this book and seris. A great plot, Awsome characters ( Will is my fav.), and the best detail I have seen in a book in all my 12 years living.The book is pumped full of excitement. I fell in love with this book just as Will and Lyra fell in love. You will be so sad at the end for A. Will and Lyra, And B. Because the seris just ended. And if Phillip Pullman happens to read my review, I hope he makes an epiloge of sorts. That would be the best thing ever.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is absolutely wonderful, one of the few commercially successful albums I have heard recently that seems to portray a true view of the hip-hop culture...a culture which ascends over all barriers of color. Lauryn Hill is a musical genius and her success should be an inspiration to everyone. <br />I would like to say something to all the people who have written in calling her a racist, or those who were obviously racists themselves.  I am a white male, and we are the most racist of all people (supposedly), right? Well I love hip hop culture ... .  But black people like Lauryn Hill have been the main musical experimenters and genre creators of our time.  Almost all popular music today can be traced back to african american creation and/or roots. Just about the only musical genres I can think of that haven't been heavily infulenced by blacks are classical and possibly celtic.  Even all you racists sitting around listening to your all-white-american bluegrass (nothing against bluegrass, i love it) have blacks to thank for your banjo, and almost every other instrument you use has been derived from black innovations. Not to mention the heavy infulence of slave songs and spirituals.<br />Lauryn Hill is not a racist, but a realist. White men, my anscestors, screwed black people and indians out of freedom, humility, and basic human rights. You call her a racist just because she hangs on to her roots and refuses to conform to \\"our\\" white culture?? I am WHITE and ... even I find it hard to conform to a culture which has been so horribly oppressive to all people.<br />Basically, this album is an awesome celebration of a culture which Lauryn Hill portrays with emotion and soul ... .

B00005QCVT|5.0|I'm afraid I can't really do justice to this movie with a less-than-1000-words review.<br />So, let me just say this.  Remember in &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, when Henry Fonda accidentally crashed the boat?  Well, this movie reminds me a lot of that scene.  Imagine...an entire movie that makes you think about boats and rocks and Henry Fonda.<br />I know that some will argue with my perspective.  Many of you are probably thinking, &quot;Comparing 'Requiem for a Dream' to 'On Golden Pond' is like comparing 'Cop Rock' with 'The Knight Rider.'&quot;  But that's just the kind of comparison that makes this movie so darn appealing!<br />You'll have a blast, from the opening credits, all the way through the message at the end of the movie that says that no animals were harmed in the making of this movie.  By the way, the fact that no animals were harmed is ANOTHER reason to see 'Requiem for a Dream'.<br />Stay away from those movies that harm animals.  See 'Requiem for a Dream' instead.
0375507507|5.0|Before living in Zimbabwe for 2 years (as a white volunteer), I had many opinions and misconceptions of the white &quot;Rhodies&quot;.  Yes, many of them are racist in an extreme way that I had not encountered before.  The way many view the black Zimbabweans made my skin crawl and my stomach turn.  However, I tried to understand their experience and realized that in order for them to survive and live as they had always done, whites had to view the black Zimbabweans as little more than animals--people that don't deserve control of their own country.  That doesn't make the white Zimbabweans right, but when you read Alexandra Fuller's book, you get the idea that white families were just living, trying to survive in a beautiful yet harsh and unforgiving land.  They were probably living and surviving in a very similar way as the first whites did in America as we were taking away land from the Native Americans and using slave labor to expand our holdings.  <br />Finally, this book is an amazing and unapologetic account of a process that has repeated itself many times throughout Africa.  It's very complex, but at the same time very simple.  I enjoyed reading the book, recognizing places and common things that happen there--even hearing the Rhodesian accents in my head (hey).  I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who has or wishes to travel throughout post-colonial Africa.
1573222038|5.0|This third book of hers clinches it. Sarah Waters is god. There is nothing she can't do. Tipping the Velvet was great; Affinity was beyond great; Fingersmith is sublime. Reading it took over my life. Okay, that's happened once in a while before with a really fine book. But I don't recall this ever happening before: being so engulfed by a book that it made me dizzy, feverish, downright sickened--and hey, if you don't get that these are good things then you're not a serious reader--in sum, it rendered me virtually incapable of going about my daily life, my head and heart were spinning so over Sue and Maud and their story.<br />Waters has singlehandedly reinvented--no, no, she transcends--lesbian fiction, a genre that up to now has consisted almost exclusively of embarrassing, dim, dismal, dumbed-down dreck. Her writing is literary, her plots are engrossing, her feel for time and place is flawless, and sheesh, she even pulls off incredibly sexy sex scenes that are beautiful, believable, move the story forward and leave the reader's heart pounding.<br />Fingersmith is breathtaking. Waters is an awesome talent. Goddamn. She does us lesbians proud.
B00005Y23E|5.0|Ask someone to name a reggae artist, and the first name that comes to mind is always Bob Marley. The Rasta man's greatest hits collection, Legend, is the best-selling reggae album of all time, certified 10 times platinum. To many, this compilation is the reggae album--and the Marley album--for even casual fans. Over the past few months, the folks at Universal have been remastering Marley's classic material and reissuing it with loads of bonus material. Well, they've just done it again.<br />Now Legend is bigger and better than ever, with almost 2 ½ hours of music. The first disc, &quot;Legend Remastered&quot; features the 14 tracks from the original album, plus two the additional cuts that appeared on the UK cassette.  But the real jewels are found on disc two, \\"The Legend Remixes,&quot; which contains 13 remixes, most of which have never appeared anywhere other than the original 12\\" singles. One of the best, and of particular interest for collectors, is the previously unreleased remix of &quot;Lively Up Yourself.&quot;<br />The new deluxe edition of Legend includes the original artwork, photos and liner notes, plus a whole lot more. Whether you're a long time Marley fan, or just someone looking for some good reggae, this compilation is an essential part of any collection. The legend lives on.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|That voice...damn.  The way it flows and breaks live is even better than the studio cuts.  The band's performance EASILY warrants a 5-star rating, especially as regards Sade's singing and the heightened role of the guitars.  However, I do agree with the other complaints about the crowd noise.  For those who haven't heard the CD yet, we're not talking about applause between songs; we're talking about shrieks, whoops, yells, catcalls, \\"I love you\\"s, etc., during the QUIET parts of songs. It's almost tolerable through speakers, but it RUINS the CD through headphones.  Perhaps the DVD's 5.1 mix has them buried in the rear channels and they were too lazy to do a seperate mixdown for the CD.  I dunno, but I'll find out this week when I buy the DVD.  Whoever mixed this CD should be taken out and shot (or forced to do mix-downs on 'N-Synch concert footage). <br />As far as the track selection goes, I miss Pearls more than any other (She KILLS on that song live!!!), and I wish to hell they hadn't faded out Red Eye after Smooth Operater.  Other than that, not a bad job taking tracks from 5 albums and making a live CD.<br />To sum up, I'd say this is essential for fans, but undesirable for newcomers, who would be better served buying Best of and Lover's Rock
068484267X|4.0|The non-fiction read of Angela's Ashes captured our attention with an infinite barrage of pure human emotions and experiences.  Author Frank McCourt captures extensive details in his writing by illustrates the poignant severity of the poor Irish Catholic childhood in Limerick Ireland.  The sentiment exhibited throughout the book by virtually all members of the McCourt family allows the reader to connect with \\"old\\" Ireland.   The vivid imagery of the depression and stark hunger of Limerick is articulated so well that at several points during the book readers can actually identify with the family's humiliation.  An Example of such an occasion is the Christmas Eve dinner.  Due to sever poverty, the family is forced to beg for extra food.  The only food that can be spared is a pig's head that the mother (Angela) cooks up, eyes and all.  Frankie himself faces ultimate shame when, in carrying the pig's head home, it sheds its newspaper covering which draws mocking disgust from surrounding pedestrians in downtown Limerick.  The general position of the family in society only worsens as the father flees shortly there after, the weekly doll of sixteen pence canceled with his desertion.  Frankie's life is full of trials: from his father's love of alcohol to the boys' rubber tire soled shoes; from his first love Theresa to the first time he loses trust in his Mam, his life is full of a tremendous amount grief.  Through out the book Frank McCourt is constantly overcoming overwhelming adversity that surely would have ruined a lesser man.  Though we consider this book to be rather depressing in nature, it also shares with the reader a substantiated love of life.

6301735048|4.0|This movie is a guilty pleasure for me. I was one of the few who enjoyed it when it was first released. I was aware of the Jim Harrison novella and Kevin Costner still hadn't squandered his talent. I had a hard time explaining why it intrigued me until I realized that it was a true romance. Medieval in concept, merely updated. Costner is the knight-errant, Anthony Quinn the evil baron who has locked Costner's true love, Madeleine Stowe, away in a 'tower'. Though it's not as heart wrenching as I thought as a younger man, there is enough mystery in some of the images to hold my attention.<BR>And then, there's Madeleine Stowe, a true raven-haired beauty. Enough to stir the imagination of even an aging boomer.
B00005221L|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger hasn't made many films much better than this one. Neither has John McTiernan. Yes it's stupid, but it's fun. Sit back and let the bullets fly and the blood flow in an orgy of male machismo. Deft one-liners and nice 80's action movie clichs are in abundance, but we shouldn't knock it, sometimes that's all we want from a movie.<BR>If you don't know the story, then I would like to be the first to welcome you back from whatever planet it is you have been on (I don't mean that in a cruel way, but come on, everyone has seen this!) anyway, a crack squad of soldiers is sent in to retrieve a diplomat from the South American jungle and they end up being stalked by some kind of... Predator. I'm sure you'll read the other reviews and synopsis so I won't go any further.<BR>In conclusion, this film is really fun, and the disc is adequate, if you are looking solely for sound quality and picture quality. If, however, you are after special features then I recommend a visit to Amazon.co.uk (but only worth a look if you can play region 2 DVD's) and you will be able to pick up the special edition (a 2-disc set with special features!)
B000055Y0Y|5.0|&quot;In The Line of Fire&quot; is a thinking person's movie with lots of action, suspense, and brains as well! It gets better and better every time that I watch it! Clint Eastwood gave a superb performance as Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan, a man who is haunted by a loss. In 1963, he was guarding President John F. Kennedy when the commander-in-chief was assassinated in Dallas, TX. Horrigan's inability to divert the tragedy has wreaked havoc on his personal life, making the aging agent socially reclusive and chagrined at his own failures. &quot;A living legend; the only active agent who ever lost a President&quot;, says Horrigan of his soiled reputation. His chance to redeem himself comes soon enough, though.<br />A meticulous psychopath named Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a outstanding and frightening performance) is threatening the current president, and Horrigan is back on the case. Leary identifies himself as John Booth, an eerie reference to President Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Leary taunts Horrigan for his failings, and his pranks become more dangerous as he gets closer to his endgame.<br />Wolfgang Petersen (&quot;Das Boot&quot;, &quot;Air Force One&quot;) directs this super-slick thriller with sheer intensity and explosive action as well. Two powerhouse actors, plus a great supporting cast (Rene Russo, Dylan McDermott, John Mahoney, Gary Cole, Fred Dalton Thompson) make &quot;In The Line of Fire&quot; one of the absolute best suspense films of 1993!
B000002513|5.0|This was the first Bruce Springsteen album I ever heard.  I didn't know of him before the Time/Newsweek covers, and then my curiosity wanted to see what it was all about.  Several people were lying around a dorm listening to it.  I still remember lying flat on my back, eyes closed, listening to \\"Incident on 57th\\" Street.  The song was about halfway through, and I'm thinking \\"OK, I'll stick with for awhile\\", and then I hear the chorus in the backgroud singing \\"Those romantic young boys...\\".  My head shot up, and nothing would ever be the same again.  This was a guy who knew how to make rock and roll, and make rock and roll exactly the way I thought it should be.  <br />I have listened to several thousand record albums through the years, and this one is definately in the top five.  Side two may be the best single side ever made.  As far as best song ever recorded, \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" and \\"New York City Serenade\\" are both contenders.  I've told several people in my personal circle that if I'm on a death bed, I want those around me to play \\"New York City Serenade\\", and time it so it ends just as I do.  Is this big enough praise?<br />Anyway, Bruce would go on to bigger things, and definately great things, but not necessarily better things.  While the next album would continue the rock and roll homage with \\"Roy Orbison singing for the lonely\\", this album captured the fun and romance of rock and roll like maybe none ever would again.
B00000K19E|4.0|The Sticky must agree that the Matrix is one of the finest steak movies around.  There are many reasons for this.  One, the steak being eaten by Cipher just looks extraordinary.  Juicy, well presented, and when Cipher puts it in his mouth, Sticky's mouth was well.. sticky.<br />But the great thing about it was Cipher's subversive comment about the steak.  He notes that even though he realises he's not eating a steak he still loves it ie. &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot;<br />And Sticky agrees that's a wonderful metaphor for Sticky Rice, well cooked steak in movies, clever packaging for DVDs and Ben Affleck's sick laugh.
6304806434|5.0|This movie is the best! I love Nicolas Cage in it. It is one of his best movies. If you have a crush on him. This would be the movie to watch.  I enjoyed all the characters in the book.
B00000064G|5.0|When I picked up this album, I had been looking for quiet study music.  What I found was an artist with a beautiful voice, poetic lyrics and absoultely moving music.  This fulfilled my yearning for music in the vein of james taylor, with a melancholic air that forces you to feel.  Pink Moon is one of my new favorites.
6304806434|5.0|This movie is GREAT!!! I love Nicolas Cage in the movie. He is HOT HOT!!
B000002H97|5.0|For any nu-metal fans this album is a must have.  This is where the nu-metal started.  Bands like Drowning Pool and others wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the Black Album.  Every song rocks and they never get old.  I reccomend this CD to any fans of good music.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A truly wonderful and moving film. It makes me miss those long trips between cities I take during college and home. I feel sorry for people who live in East Coast cities who will never experience the awe of driving through a rich countryside. Maybe if they watch THE STRAIGHT STORY they'll realize just what they're missing out on.
0571202284|5.0|The last guy must own a huge stash of Blair books or just NOT GET IT.<br />Not to Blair-bash.  That style of animation has its place, but this book is loaded with real, practical animation advice, as well as many theoretical touchstones on which to innovate.  People who actually animate will find this book WAY MORE than worth the price of admission, and, as my review title suggests, Essential.<br />Makes a great companion to the history, theory, and propoganda-laden (but still Essential as well) Illusion of Life by Thomas and Johnston.
B000059XUO|4.0|As with all good movies, \\"The Crow\\" is more than the sum of its parts. You could classify it as action, revenge, supernatural -- but it is really a love story, set against a background so grungy and gothic it looks like the Boulevard of Broken Dreams after an artillery boimbardment. The city (Detroit, sort of) is a decaying, rain-swept sewer run by an occultist crimn lord... who sends his goons to murder good-natured guitarist Eric Draven (Lee) and his fiance... Cut to a year later, when Draven bursts out of his own grave on a quest for some serious payback... \\"The Crow\\" is an extremely dark, bleak, bleached-out film, set to a sly, sinister rock-grunge soundtrack, but the overall message is actually sappy -- that love triumphs over all. The contrast works, and while Lee may not have been a great actor, he had more charisma than he knew what to do with. I can't think of any other actor who could have pulled off such a complicated role, alternating from tenderness to bloodlust and back, without batting an eye. The idea of a soul reaching out from beyond to right a wrong and meet up with his lost true love is poignent enough, and Lee's tragic demise only adds to that emotion. Bottom line: whatever its flaws, this is just a damn good movie. Period.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Despite the overwhelming accolades this film seems to have generated, Memento is a real dud.  Very gimmicky and self-conscious, this film expects the viewer to automatically care about its protagonist and his ludicrous dilemma.  It's true that Guy Pearce may succeed in arousing a very mild affection for his character, but that I think is due merely to the amount of time (depending on one's patience) the viewer spends watching him go through his paces.  Even if the ending were extraordinarily mind-blowing (which it is not), it still would not adequately compensate the viewer for the time invested to get there.  The film is extremely tedious to sit through:  the characters are not interesting, the acting unremarkable, and the dialogue insipid.  Why anybody would sit through this bilge, and why the director assumes people will, is the real mystery.  The film  resembles a poor made-for-TV movie, at best, that you might come across on the USA channel (and promptly dismiss).  It's a perfect example of what somebody must have considered a unique concept with great potential, but alas, this effort fails to realize that potential.  All of the fancy devices like flipping back through time and the alternating use of color vs. black & white cannot disguise how boring and empty the movie is.  All flash and no substance makes Jack a dull movie viewer.  For your sake, I hope you listen to the one voice of reason crying in the wilderness of mistaken notions of effective filmmaking.  Take the two hours you would waste on this [stuff] and watch Snatch instead.  Say what you will of its subtsance, that film, at least, contains, along with its flash, almost nonstop humor and an abundance of compelling character acting.  With a minimum of characterization, Snatch succeeds where Memento does NOT, in showing us why we should (or shouldn't) care about the characters, and then the film keeps us entertained all throughout, instead of having faith that we will respect a single corny concept enough to wait two tedious hours for a payoff that, in this instance, doesn't come.  I give it one star merely to recognize the (misguided) efforts required to make the film, and because I have (I think) endured worse films.  Don't think twice, avoid Memento.
0446525537|5.0|Sometimes, you come across a book that is not only unforgettable, but that actually changes the way you look at the things of life. It did happen to me with biographies and essays, but never before with a novel. This book is not only the most pure and delicate love story I have ever read, but through Jamie's wonderful character, it made me understand for the first time, in all its beauty and majesty, what God had in mind when He created the woman. I think I have fallen in love with the character of a novel...
B00003CXS4|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off after about twenty minutes. I just couldn't get into at all for some reason. I was laying on the couch with my girl (my ex- now), who fell asleep after about fifteen minutes, and, for some reason, I could not see where the appeal was in this movie. I really didn't think I'd even bother trying to watch it again. Well, the next night my girl went home early, so me an' my homeboy bought a couple 18 cases'a beer an' ordered a pizza and decided just for the hell of it to pop in the movie.  I started it back at the beginning and we sat there, seeing if we could not only comprehend, but enjoy the film.  Well, I don't know if it was the alcohol, but when the movie was finished, I sat there in awe at what I had just seen, which was what I perceived as one of the best films in the past decade of cinema. I may be overstating it a little, but there's jus' sumpin' really alluring here that I'm not sure how to describe.     Unlike many viewers I've read here, I never once felt compelled to watch it with the sub-titles on, even if I didn't really understand some things. Instead, I was compelled to watch it over and over again to catch it all (I watched it twice in that first night and then again the next day! Okay, okay, I was unemployed at the time, but STILL). The story involves diamonds an' underground bare-knuckle boxing and different gangs of underworld characters with seemingly-irrelevant sub plots that all intertwine into one single WEIRD-ARSE story. The brilliant ensemble cast really bring the material to life. Even in his surprisingly small role, Benicio del Toro as Frankie Four Fingers, the high-profile thief who steals the diamond and has it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, turns in a unique, great performance. But is' definitely Pitt who steals the show though as \\"One Punch Mickey\\", an Irish Gypsy who becomes a pawn for two shady promoters who are in hock to a crime czar. Pitt is probably the most incomprehensible character in the entire movie, too. I mean, most of the time you really cannot understand a DAMN thing he is saying, but it makes it all the more fun.    The ending of this film will definitely trip you out, and I encourage repeat viewings from everyone who watches this movie. Guy Ritchie is turning out to be a very interesting director who I'm going to have to keep my eye on and see how his other projects turn out. I haven't seen 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' yet, and, from what I gather reading other reviews, it is very similar to 'Snatch'. I guess some people would view that as a good thing and some would view that as a bad thing. Don't worry, I ain't gonna form an opinion until I see it, but, any movie that is as smart, and well-executed as this one is sure to be a favorite of mine. I enjoyed this movie even more than I enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' if you wanna know how good I think it is, and I'm also downright ashamed that I didn't feel it the first time around. So, to all new viewers, when you watch it, don't be too quick to judge, because it may take a little bit to pull you in. But once it does, youse in for a real treat.
6304082428|5.0|I believe Miss Austen would have approved of this adaptation.  It does not try to re-write the book; it follows it with amazing accuracy.  The cinematography is exquisite, the acting is brilliant (especially Colin Firth)...I could go on and on.  I watch it several times a year and every time it is as good as the first time. This mini-series is a triumph.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It took me several years to finally get around to reading the books that had managed to get all five of my children so thoroughly enthralled.  Like perhaps everyone else on the planet, I also became enthralled by J.K. Rowling's works.<br />So, it was with a great amount of trepidation that I went to see the first Harry Potter film.  Having been disappointed so many times before, I found it hard to believe that the magical world created by J.K. Rowling could possibly translate to the screen.  After all, these worlds were so intricately detailed, so perfectly described, and so different from anything that we had previously experienced.  After four books, I had a \\"perfect\\" mental image of every character, every place, every event.<br />However, I am delighted to say that I was wrong, and very much impressed by the way that all of this detail was captured in the film.  The characters were very much like I had them pictured.  I can't think of a single detail that was left out.<br />The acting is superb.  The visual effects are stunning.  The film was very well directed, and the editing was masterful.  Instead of spoiling my mental images, the film simply enhanced them even more.<br />This is THE film to own on DVD.  You, your kids, your neighbours and your relatives will come back to watch it again and again.
B00005QIPH|4.0|It's very, very simple, folks.  This is a good, tight band with guitar chops, and strong songs brimming with old-fashioned rock and roll joy.  I hadn't heard a WORD about them in the media; then someone played &quot;Is This It,&quot; for me, and my head was bobbing like those doggies with spring heads lolling on dashboards.<BR>  You can name their parentage if you want: VU, Iggy Pop, etc, etc, but who doesn't have parents?  Was Dylan criticized for revering Guthrie?  U2 played Bay City Rollers covers when they began, for crying out loud.  <BR>  There have always been nay-sayers who cry &quot;hype&quot; whenever someone gets attention, and as soon as it's popular, someone has &quot;sold out&quot; and it's not cool to listen to.  Hasn't this elitism been properly skewered in &quot;High Fidelity?&quot;  If it's good, listen to it, but quit fretting about all the tangential issues that have nothing to do with what's pounding out of the speakers.  <BR>  It's good stuff.  Try it.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This DVD pleased me very much with its songs,artwork and this movie really brings out the child in all of us.This DVD of VHS will make you laugh,smile,and even make you cry.This is a movie that should be watched by everyone.
6304341849|5.0|Truly an enjoyable movie.  This movie should be an inspiration to all persons (regardless) of orientation. I suspect that I will have to read the book, in order to find out the actual ending.  The movie (though quite enjoyable) left me hanging, wondering if Maurice suffered any consequences for his life choice.  Excellent performances, all around!

B00005NI5Y|5.0|A number of things struck me when I first heard this CD.<BR>Firstly, I love the High Midwestern country/blues/rock sensibility of the music. I heard it long ago on a demo country record from South Dakota, and Dylan plays it with a vengeance. Dylan has never more clearly [IMHO] recognised his roots.  It's melodic and sensible, and the lyrics, while not transcendent, nevertheless affect you with their wry commentary and usual insight.<BR>Secondly, what's with the voice?  It certainly isn't drying out. <BR>If anything it's stronger, maybe because Dylan has settled into an understanding of its current nature.  Whatever the reason, it all fits perfectly together.<BR>This is mature stuff, yea.  Like a fine wine [please excuse the triteness] this is subtle and knowing and worth many listens to get past the original tang and twang and explore the rest for yourself.<BR>Best of all though, it's just fun.
B00003CX5P|3.0|i have writin a review before but know that i saw the dvd i will review again i dont think this is all that bad. i mean now that were use to special effects and big budget movies we wont be as impressed as we were with the origanl star wars 20 years ago. the two most attacked points of this movie are jake lloyd and jar jar binks. first of all jakes not that bad if in the frist wars fl9ms the acting was all that great. i think jake is good in wha tlittle he was given i mean  anakin just  akid so jake played  akid. a jar jar is supposed to be annoiing.
0385501560|4.0|I did not want to like this book---but I did. Dare I say that I even enjoyed it, and will remember some of the brutal images and language used in it for quite some time. I have even recommended the novel to friends.<br />That said---<br />Choke is an entertaining novel about self loathing and discovery. The author's voice is terse, the tone of the work is often clinical, stark and lonely.  Choke will make you feel both lousy and lucky at the same time.<br />While reading, I laughed out loud, I gagged--and I groaned, in recognition, sympathy and disgust.<br />Choke is worth the time and trouble. Enjoy.

B00005Y228|4.0|Welcome USA to Kylie Minogue. Never will you witness such an amazing performer which will leave you as breathless as Kylie. Thankfully, some of us in the UK have been enoying Kylie's music since 1987. You may recall The Locomotion. Yep, that's her! She's been a long way since, but Fever is thankfully a clear nod to the retro pop vibe, without sounding dated. You'll already know Can't Get You Out Of My Head, and possibly Butterfly. But boy, have you got a lot to catch up on. The album is a hedonistic club motivated album. With simple lyrics and consistent high energy beats it will be the soundtrack to the summer, or year, or youth! Trust me, this album will rock your world.
B00005LMWI|5.0|Is Kamelot the best power metal band on Earth?  Well, I think they are at least the best European-style power metal band around.  And Khan may be the best singer in all of metal.<br />Some things you should know about Kamelot:<br />1. Though three-fourths of the band members are American, Kamelot is definitely a European power metal band in style.  In other words, their music has a lot more in common with Stratovarius and Rhapsody than Iced Earth and Jag Panzer.<br />2. Kamelot isn't cliched like many European power metal bands are.  Sure, they sing about some of the same things (magic, dragons, honor, glory, knights, etc.).  But even though vocalist Khan is from Europe, he commands the English language better than most European power metal lyricists.  Kamelot avoids clumsy and cliched lyrics.<br />3. Though one reviewer here thinks vocalist Khan doesn't fit the music, Khan is still the best vocalist in all of power metal.  Doesn't fit the music?!?  Would you rather have a vocalist who tries to sing out of his range, mangles the English language and sounds like every other Euro power metal singer?  No.  Khan is a great singer (think Queensryche's Geoff Tate).  He has range and is always in control of his voice.<br />4. Kamelot, though not really a progressive metal band, does have some prog touches here and there thanks to Khan.  Khan's background as prog metal band Conception's lead singer and co-songwriter serve him well as a member of Kamelot.  Khan's songwriting adds just enough difference to Kamelot's power metal base to make them stand out above the rest of the power metal norm.<br />5. Guitarist Thomas Youngblood.  His playing style is awesome--equal parts thrash, speed and melody.<br />Karma, Kamelot's fifth studio album, may be the best album of 2001.  It is every bit as good as Kamelot's previous disc, the Fourth Legacy.  Every song is a highlight.  Speed and power with just a hint of progressive is the Kamelot recipe.
B00005B5L4|5.0|Simply put, I am really picky and I have a dozen or more DVD-audio disks. If you are new to DVD-audio remember that the mixing engineer has to be as talented as the musicians.  A bad mixing can ruin a great album.  This is one is well mixed and well worth the money.
B00005QG9J|1.0|P.U.!! What's that smell? Oh, it's this CD.
B00000427L|4.0|I would have given this recording a rating of five stars, however, am reluctant to because of the sound of Ashkenazy's piano.  There are a few moments throughout where the piano sounds as though it could have used a pitch adjustment.  As much as a tried to ignore the stale sound, I couldn't help but notice how it  slightly took away from the performance.<BR>All things aside, I said it slightly took away from the performance.  Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos are monsterous works of brilliance, passion, and beauty.  Ashkenazy's playing is powerful and awe inspiring.
B000002L7G|5.0|This album should be held up as an example of how a recording should sound. Excellent quality. All intruments come across smooth and clear especially drums, guitar and piano. There's no dud on this album although my personal favourite is the title song. Dire Straits must have had a handle on the overall production of this recording. It shines brighly even though it's 17 years old.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Pac's, excuse me, Makaveli's final studio album was exactly what I thought it was gonna be, deep, thought-provoking album, with brutal diatribes directed at his enemies. He goes at Biggie again, Jigga, Nas, and Mobb Deep, on \\"Bomb First\\" and the calculus-hard \\"Against All Odds\\". Other hot songs on the album include, \\"Life of an Outlaw\\", \\"Krazy\\" feat. a tight verse by Bad Azz, the underrated \\"Me and My Girlfriend\\", the creepy classic \\"Hail Mary\\", \\"Toss it Up\\" (I love when he disses Dre), and \\"2 Live and Die in LA\\". This cd is a must have for any Tupac fan or just any rap fan in general East coast or West coast.
B00005LOUP|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and saw it as soon as it came out. I was disappointed. It wasn't so much that the movie was bad, but I think one of Dr. Seuss' most cherished stories deserved better than average. The Grinch has always been a story about the simple meaning of Christmas - this just turned it into a giant marketing tool.<BR>On the good side, Jim Carrey does amazing things under all that fur, and the DVD has some nifty extras. Go ahead and buy this for your kids if they loved it in theaters, but make sure to get them the original, too. And throw in the book for good measure.
B00005ARDC|3.0|These guys are alright some songs are good (the &quot;Rock N' Roll song) but overall the lyrics are too pretentious and it sounds like they are trying too hard to be &quot;cool&quot;.<br />This is their debut so maybe they'll get better and find their own sound...Try some instrumentals , add a saxaphone or something!<br />They are better than those whining STROKES though.<BR>I would suggest the ex-SPIRITUALIZED LUPINE HOWL band instead of these guys...(They totally ripped of bassist Sean Cooks black leather image!)
B00005B36H|5.0|Imagine an album that can seem like one long, long song. Imagine that this 50-60 minute journey not only holds together, but careens on like the roller coaster thrill ride of a lifetime. <BR>This is LATERALUS. <BR>With a pulsating, tribal beat woven in from start to finish, the band alternately roars and whispers, revisits earlier themes while twisting them inside out, locks into trance-inducing, delicate interplays, beautiful moments of silence, before switching gears to neck-snapping waves of aural ecstasy, then back again, and again. Repeat. It's a trip of the best kind, and with a minimum of artifice. A pure, live presentation in an age of studio overkill. A rare masterpiece.
B00003Q43A|1.0|This movie redefines the term \\"awful\\", and will have you cursing the makers of this movie for the two precious hours of your life they stole from you. Absolutely everything is simply terrible. The special effects are predictable, the acting is pathetic, and the script is insulting to anyone with an IQ over 50. Why! Why was such an obvious piece of \\"you know what\\" of a movie given the green light!? And why did it make so much money at the box office!? And why is there a need to release a second, Five Star, version of the DVD!? Please...I beg you...DO NOT buy this movie under any circumstances!! There are so many excellent movies out there that deserve your attention. Independence Day is NOT one of them!!
0140544518|5.0|This is a book the entire family can enjoy.  It is completely hilarious for a children's book.  You know how kids get hooked on a book and want you to read it over and over and over again? Well, this is one of those books that you HOPE they want you to read over and over and over again.  It is just a lot of fun.  I highly recommend the \\"Wolf's\\" side of the story about what \\"really\\" happened with the three little pigs.  Adorable!
0393314804|5.0|I read this book after falling in love with the movie.<br />The book provides so much more background than the movie - not that the movie was blatently lacking, just that the book went deeper.<br />The books is both funny and depressing.  The junkie lifestyle definitely breeds misery in the lives of the main characters.  Their lives take place in a fascinating modern Edinburgh and London, however, which make great &quot;scenery.&quot;<br />There was one very uncomfortable/unpleasant chapter about &quot;revenge&quot; that I was glad was absent from the movie and was difficult to get through.  This particular chapter probably makes this book a poor choice for squeemish folks.
0452282152|2.0|While this novel is &quot;richly imagined,&quot; it lacks sophistication and depth, and the writing style leaves a lot to be wished for.  Vermeer has long been one of my favorite artists, but -- while I think this is an intriguing topic -- it needs, perhaps, a different author to handle it.  The book has a vacuous, &quot;goodie-goodie&quot; feel that strikes me as being aimed at adolescent readers rather than at adults.
014100018X|5.0|I really liked this book!  It was charming in its simplicity, yet the descriptions of the characters and the little French village where they all lived made me yearn for more. The whole story was just so much like a fairy tale for adults!  I had seen the movie before I read the book, yet I truly enjoyed both in different ways.  The book gives you a little more depth than the movie, I think.  The only problem was that I kept craving chocolate while I was reading this book, so eventually I just gave in to it and ate Dove chocolates like crazy!  The thick creamy chocolate bits made the book just that much sweeter. You will like this book, too--just be sure you have plenty of chocolate on hand while reading!  P.S. - Try some of Joanne Harris' other books, too.  They are just as good!
B00004VWA7|4.0|There are a number of albums on the market which showcase outstanding electric bass players. Most of them are of little interest to anyone other than other electric bass players. This CD is an exception.<br />While there are copious opportunities to appreciate Mr. Pastorius's mastery of his chosen instrument, this is at its core a collection of solid tunes. Jaco shows us here that he is more than just a bass hotshot. His compositions are interesting, inventive, and bear repeated listening. His arrangements are quite good, particularly his string arrangements which take the strings beyond their usual role in jazz, a wash in the background, and give them lively parts that interact with the other instruments.<br />There is a lot of great ensemble playing here, particularly from Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter. The hot tunes are red hot and the slow tunes are moody and expressive. All kinds of interesting rhythm going on all the time.<br />Of course, to the electric bass player is a must have. This is the man who re-defined the role of the electric bass in modern music, and has irrevocably influenced every important bass player that came after him. This will inspire you to get off your behind and go practice. But this is not just a record for bass players.
0345350499|5.0|Many of Marion Zimmer Bradley's books are rather fluffy fantasies, fun and light.  This is not the case with the mystical, magical \\"The Mists of Avalon.\\"  This spendid book is a retelling of the King Arthur legend from the point of view of the women involved, principally, Morgaine, King Arthur's half-sister and Priestess of Avalon, and Gwenhwyfar, the Christian princess and future Queen of Camelot.<br />Although \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" has been criticized as being a \\"feminist\\" book, I don't think this criticism holds up.  Yes, the author chose to focus on the conflicts and emotions of the women involved, but their gender is far less important in the book than is their religion.  Morgaine, as a Druid and Priestess of the Goddess, is struggling to keep her dying religion alive against the growth of Christianity and Gwenhwyfar.<br />The main character in \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is Morgaine and we follow her from childhood to her rise as a priestess on the mystical Isle of Avalon, the home of the druids of the Old Religion, the religion of the Goddess.  Avalon, as can be deduced from the book's title, is surrounded by swirling, protective mists that cause it to be invisibe to all but the initiated.  Morgaine's life, down to its very core, is shaped both by her desire to serve the Goddess and by her despair at seeing the Old Religion being tossed aside in favor of Christianity, by royalty and the common people alike.<br />The book also focuses on Gwenhwyfar, and we are privy to her first meeting with Arthur when, as an innocent child, she crosses through the mists of Avalon to the other side.  As Queen, she is a guilt-ridden figure who turns to Christianity in her desire to bear a child and begs Arthur to do the same, thus bringing about the fall of Camelot.<br />While I found Morgaine to be a character of depth, intelligence and tremendous emotional range, Gwenhyfar came off as shallow, jealous and more than a little suspicious.  Viviane, The Lady of the Lake, who also plays quite a role in this book, seems to be a little too manipulative, but very interesting, nonetheless.<br />Anyone interested in Wiccan rituals will find this book extremely interesting.  The transformations from ordinary woman to priestess and the effects of the Old Religion on the \\"modern\\" world are simply part and parcel of this book's magic.<br />This is a long book, but don't let its length put you off.  It is an extremely fascinating and pleasant read and it's quite easy to find a stopping place should you need to put the book down (though I doubt you'll want to).<br />Those looking for historical accuracy regarding the rise of Christianity in Britain should look to another book.  \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is entertainment, pure and simple.  The portrayal of Druidism and the focus on the priestesses of Avalon, descended from the lost island of Atlantis, the frequent visits to the land of the Fairy--all of this places this book squarely within the fantasy genre, rather than the historical realm.  And, all to the good.<br />I found \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" to be an all-absorbing book and one that gave me a new perspective on the Arthurian legend.  The women involved became more real to me, with many new facets and aspects of personality.  I am so glad I read this book.  I found it magical, mystical and unforgettable and it's one book I am recommending to everyone I know, whether they are fantasy addicts or not.
B000002U3P|5.0|I raved quite a bit about the movie and book, so my sister gave me the two Trainspotting soundtracks for Christmas.<br />The first soundtrack is far superior to the second, in my opinion.<br />The music in the first album for me maintains a strong emotional bond to the movie.<br />This album was my first real introduction to Trance music which I have become quite fond of since.<br />The album also has a neat cover of Blondie's &quot;Rapture.&quot;  I am also quite fond of the song &quot;Mile End&quot; by Pulp and Lou Reed's &quot;Perfect Day&quot; which is beautiful.
6301768809|4.0|Stallone might be the main actor here, but Brian Denahy (one of America's most-loved character actors), who plays a ... cop in a small Pacific Northwest town, sums up the film's message best, when asked by Rambo, \\"why are you pushin' me?\\"  Denahy's response is a brilliant summation of the insidious fascist collectivism lying at the root of our nation's alleged \\"rugged individuality\\", and serves to provoke the heroic rallying cry of Rambo's gallant non-conformism:<br />\\"First of all, you don't ask the questions around here.  I do.  You understand?  Secondly, we don't want guys like you in this town.  Drifters.  First thing you know we got a whole bunch a guys like you in this town.  That's why.  Besides, you wouldn't like it here . . . this is . . .  this is a quiet little town.  In fact, you might say its boring.  But that's the way we like it, and I get paid to keep it that way.\\"<br />A challenge indeed.  The battle table is now set, and before it's all over, Rambo will have outrun, outwitted, and seriously crippled a dozen sadistic police officers (as well as a few good family men), a whole platoon of national guardsmen, and a few tracking dogs to boot.  Rambo is a monster, a Frankenstein, created by the masters of war in the Pentagon, and now they're reaping the fruits of their own bitter harvest.  However, this is one Frankenstein that fights his battles in a half-hearted manner, dragged down by an inner conflict of will.  We see in the film's opening sequence that Rambo has not felt grounded in reality since returning from the `Nam.  The \\"junk in your pockets\\" that he complains about is apt symbolism for the collected junk inside John Rambo's tortured mind.  And Denahy's small-town fear of outsiders manifests itself in a self-destructive war with a one-man army, an apt metaphor for America's cultural civil war -- the wounds of Vietnam reappearing as enduring political cleavages during the late Cold War period.
B00005T5VE|5.0|I was pretty thrilled when I saw this in the local record (CD) store!  I love the novelty of special packaging on CD's, so the little hardcover book really lured me in.  I was kind of expecting a little bit more inside than what is already in the original GHV2 CD , but alas, it was essentially the same with the exception of a few photos placed differently.  Oh, well!  The hardcover book format IS pretty cool and I did like the picture disc CD.  The guy in the record store told me that the limited edition CD's were numbered, but when I looked, I could not find any such number (maybe I missed it?). The songs are the same as on the original GHV2.  Some listeners have expressed disappointment over the songs included on this greatest hits album, but hey!  It's Madonna--I would listen to whatever she put out on a CD, quite frankly.  These were the ones which she felt had the most  potential for a person to want to listen to over and over again.  It's her album--she can decide what goes on it.  If you don't like it, make yourself a mixed-tape and be quiet! I do have to say that if you aren't a die-hard Madonna fan and you are more of just a casual listener, you would probably do better to purchase the original (and cheaper) version of GHV2 rather than the limited edition. But for those of us who must own it all---Go for it!!!!:-)
B000003C2U|4.0|This album and its followup, \\"Individual Thought Patterns,\\" stand as clinics of the death metal genre. Whereas ITP is more a technical statement with a greater emphasis on melody and musical proficiency than its predecessor, \\"Human\\" contains more bludgeoning aggression. The melody and technical playing are definitely there, but take a backseat to heaviness for the most part. Bashers like \\"Secret Face\\" and \\"Suicide Machine\\" characterize the formula used on \\"Human,\\" with long and complex instrumental passages puncuated by Chuck Shuldiner's guttural scream-growl. Steve DiGiorgio's flowing bass lines and Sean Reinert's nimble double-bass drums are excellent complements to the dual-guitar assault of Chuck and Paul Masvidal. Lyrically, Chuck's flair for social commentary is best demonstrated by \\"Suicide Machine,\\" a song that addresses the issue of euthanasia with a plea for sympathy for the dying. An all-around excellent effort.
6304806442|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it and I have watched it many times since.<br />Its a fast-paced funny, sad, moving picture.  Its a great slice-of-life view of junkies in Edinburgh.  The characters are all fantastic and almost all endearing.<br />The soundtrack was top-notch - check out the two CDs it spawned.<br />The original book is an excellent read as well.  The movie was largely true to the book however there were a number of events that took place in the book that the movie didn't show.  Reading the book clarifies a few of the things that happen in the film - for example there is a scene in the movie where Spud does some amphetamine before going to a job interview.  I was unsure of his motivation (other than getting high) in the movie but in the book it was clear that he did the speed so that it would look like he was eager for the job, but wouldn't get it - so he could continue to receive his unemployment compensation from the government.<br />I recommended this movie highly to my parents and they didn't like it.  They found it to be quite sad and depressing, which I suppose I understand, but was not something I personally felt about it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|A beautiful movie.  This movie far exceeded my expectations.  The writers, director and producer deserve credit for developing such meaningful characters. The outstanding features of the story were the fidelity and love shown by the characters toward John.  His wife did not seek comfort in the arms of someone else but stood by John and loved him through his awful problems.  This is so unlike Hollywood.  Most writers would have spiced it up with some seduction, etc. but reality is so much more appealing.  I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates substantial films rather than the traditional superficial sex/shoot-em-up Hollywood fare.
0385486804|4.0|When I first bought this book, I bought it not because I wanted to but because I had to read it for my English Composition class. The cover of the book already intrigued me and I could not wait to get started on reading the book. After reading the book, I feel like I've gotten to know the main character, Chris McCandless so well. This book is a must read for all the adventure seekers out there for it shows the extreme side of the word &quot;adventure.&quot; Chris' story forces the reader to question himself in so many countless ways that it boggles the mind.
B00005LQ04|5.0|I've read many reviews here and Suspiria is either hated or loved. Not much middle ground. I like it and always have.<br />I first saw it in a very edited version and was disappointed. Next I rented a video documentary about Argento which oddly enough showed many scenes that had been censored from the version of Suspiria I watched. Those scenes are not permitted in actual movie context but were allowed in a documentary on the directors work? That is so weird.<br />...<br />...Many complain here that there is no track listing for the 3rd disc/soundtrack in new DVD-Box.<br />I have not examined the contents of all the discs in new set yet but I know the titles to the songs.<br />Here they are: Track 1)Suspiria 5:57 2)Witch 3:10 3)Opening to the Sighs 0:32 4)Sighs 5:15 5)Markos 4:03<br />6)Black Forest 6:06  7)Blind Concert 6:11 8) Death Valzer 1:51 by Goblin (not 'the' Goblin)<br />Hope that helps some curious people.  Enjoy the movie. --alan
B00005UQ9F|4.0|I really really enjoyed the movie! It was suspenseful, creepy, and it definately kept me glued to my seat! I was literally shaking because I wanted to see how it was going to end! I wanted to know the whole story and I knew this puzzle piece would be completed by the end. Well the puzzle piece was completed...most of it. There were still some unanswered questions left at the end that I was asking myself and that is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I'm not quite sure if Brad Anderson wanted us to think supernatural or if he just wanted to show the comparisons between the insane person in the movie and the recording sessions that happened in the hospital. Is &quot;Simon&quot; really more than we think? I'm either really stupid or I just didn't look close enough. Other than those unanswered questions, the movie was awesome! The acting was superb and the suspense hit you at all the right moments. The way it was filmed made me feel like I was watching a movie made in the 80's, but I think it added to the atmosphere. The music was the creepiest...it will send chills down your spine. If you love different takes on horror/thrillers than you should definately check out this movie!!
B00005RIZP|5.0|I just received my copy of this movie today and I really liked it. It has a very spooky atmosphere and the Soriority house is the perfect place for the murders. The movie has u guessing to the end and unfortunately, it never properly reveal the killer but the killer's harassing phone calls are so chilling that it makes \\"When A Stranger Calls\\" look amateurish. To sum it up, this movie ranks up there with \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" and \\"Texas Chainsaw Masacre\\". Definately paved the way for other less than stellar horror movies and even though it was made in 1974, it still can give u chills.<br />A Killer on Christmas, what can be better!!!
B000002L9J|5.0|I know, superlatives are dumb and people will automatically think I'm a mindless Smiths fan who is unable to look outside his little Smiths world and see that there is other good music out there. And there is a lot of great great music from the 80's, it's just that none of it is as good as this. New Order may arguably be the best band of the 80's, though I wouldn't necessarily agree to that, but I don't think they've ever produced anything as comprehensive and perfect as this album (though as I just said, they are an awesome band). The Queen is Dead, The Boy with the Thorn in his Side, and There is a Light...are some of my favorite songs of all time.
B00005AFMT|5.0|I've been a King Crimson/Robert Fripp/Bill Bruford fan since the early /'70s. I also met Adrian Belew in 1977. When this album appeared in 1981 I was in heaven. I owned Brufords solo albums and Yes and UK records too. I liked Belew from his Zappa and Talking Heads appearances.  And here was my hero, Robert Fripp, back with a new King Crimson. Fantastic album!<br />This with Beat and Three of a Perfect Pair form a great trilogy of music. Crimson's current line-up still produces amazing music not to be missed. Buy THIS!
0792841344|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie!! I love horror movies all the way and this one was no exception. I never even knew about the Phantasm series until I saw the DVD \\"Boogeymen.\\" I saw the trailer and a scene from the movie and I wanted to know more. I went out and bought this DVD and it was the best investment of [money] I could ever make!! I watched it twice in one day it was so good! It is scary, gory, funny in some parts, and just plain chilling! The Tall Man is one of the scariest men to hit the horror screen! You should definatley see this movie if you love horror movies!!
0385495323|5.0|As with other books by Simon, a wonderfully written and informative narrative on the subject chosen.( cf Fermat's Last Theorem, another good example).<BR>My only complaint is that I was half-way through cracking the ten problems set , when I discovered that a team of 100's from Sweden had already claimed the prize money !!
B000000WJZ|5.0|The title says it all. I can't find any bad ones. Towards the end it may get a little, and I stress little, old, but overall totally rocking. I would have to say my favorite tracks are soma and mayonaise, though the singles are also as good as they are popular.
B00004Y6NM|3.0|While I don't think this is a vintage Clapton recording I don't think you should over look it either.  There are vintage Claptonian solo's and well written lyrics but I don't like the overall production.  It was fine for the 80's but doesn't stand the test of time.  I don't think this combo, in practical terms, makes sense.  Collins is a great drummer and a fine pop producer, his colaboration with Robert Plant was great.  I think a pop artist producing a bluesman like Clapton isn't smart.<br />I like &quot;She's Waiting&quot; but it seems to be about a minute too long and the end sounds like Phil Collins is about to break into a refrein of &quot;Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;.  I think the synthesizer sounds out of place and makes the song have a choppy feel to it.  Remove the keyboard and add a Hammon B3 and you've got a great song.<br />&quot;See What Love Can Do&quot; and &quot;Knock On Wood&quot; sound more Genesis than Claptonian but they are good tracks.  I like &quot;Same Old Blues&quot; but again, the keyboard sounds out of place, overall vintage soloing by Clapton.<br />&quot;Tangled In Love&quot; sounds like a leftover Genesis track.<br />&quot;Forever Man&quot; is definately the strongest track on the cd, probably his best solo since &quot;Layla&quot;.  &quot;Just Like A Prisoner&quot; is another strong track with a great solo as well.  These last two tracks the overall production is great.<br />Overall, this set is ok.  I'd take it on a road trip.
B000002JS6|5.0|Ok, AC/DC was, at this point, just getting over the death of their first lead singer, Bon Scott.  They Hired Brian Johnson and with this album they gained their greatest fame.  The only real problem you may find with this album is that every song ends in a similar way, with a little jam session or bent last note.  However, this is a worthy album of any CD or album collection, and is for the most part a most impressive album.  Angus can whale and is fun to listen to, Brian has an amazing high register, and Malcom lays down the rythem perfectly
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of my most favorite albums and by far the best of the year. The beats, the riffs, and all the emotion is staggering. Yes, I know they've become a mainstream but they still deliver the goods (think \\"My December\\" and \\"It's going down\\"). I've had the absolute pleasure to see them perform recently with Cypress Hill, and their fan appreciation is evident throughout their performance. They deliver well both live and on record. And I hope they'll be around for a very long time. This is the best investment to make this year in music.
B000002LQR|5.0|Few albums ever produced have this level of consistency. The only track on here not worth at least listening to is the last song \\"They're Red Hot\\" which is not even composed by the RHCP anyway. Each song is vastly different from the others, and yet at the same time they have a common feel to them, something only the peppers could reproduce. It is a level of unity and brilliance that has only ever been acheived by bands of similar caliber. And there is a reason this album has been consistently dubbed the best bass album of the century. The following are my opinions on a select few of the tracks, not necessarily my favorites.<br />Power of Equality: B+<BR>The bass line is strong and John's guitar overlay is perfect.  No real guitar or bass solo, although this song does not need one. The defining characteristic of this song is the lyrics.<br />If You Have to Ask: A<BR>Lyrics flow smoothly through this song.  Flea's bass line is intoxicating and the guitar solo near the end is soulful with a great rythym.  The drum part is very fresh and fits the song perfectly.  I would say the defining characteristic of this song is the play between the bass and guitar.<br />Funky Monks: A<BR>The beginning sets the mood for this song, which features one of the most funky, yet soulful songs in existance.  The primary feature of this song is the funky off-beat via the guitar, bass and drums, which contrasts the on-beat lyrics.  The interlude starts off with mellow guitar and the switches into overdrive, showcasing John's versatile abilities.  The end is a gradual fade out featuring funky flea improv.<br />I Could Have Lied: A<BR>In short, a very mellow song with a gradual climax and let down.  This song should be listened to by every guitar player out there as an example.  With just the right amount of distortion, John lets us all know his place in the guitar world (at the top).  This song has one of the best and most emotional guitar solos of the century.<br />Mellowship Slinky: A+<br/>John and Flea work together so well in this song.  The chemistry between them is evident when Flea, playing the brilliant background beat, merges with John's counter melody back and forth.  I dont have much else to say about this song except that the harmony between all of the RHCP in this song is perfect.<br />Naked in The Rain: A<BR>Harder to get into than some of the other songs, this song features an amazing bass line, and, later on, a tremendous bass solo and just after that and tremendous guitar solo.  Some people dont like this song because of the seemingly nonsensical lyrics, although that is obviously not the focus of this song.<br />The Greeting Song: A+<BR>A more traditional RHCP song, harking back to their early days, with the added twist of the brilliance of John Frusciante and Flea working together.  Anthony also provides perfectly timed vocal effects like echo to create a trippy feast for your ears.<br />Sir Psycho Sexy: A+<BR>I wish I could give this song a better score because it deserves it.  Dont be turned off by the first 4 minutes (as many other reviewers have said as well). Once you are into this song it will change your life.  The best way to describe this song is that it is like \\"butter\\" or as an 8 minute \\"epic.\\"  Flea, with the most unusual bass effect I have ever heard, creates the perfect background melody for the first 4 minutes  About 3 minutes into the song, there is a part where while a xylophone plays a practically trance inducing melody in the left stereo channel, while one of the 2 guitar parts plays a wah-wah-wah sound in the right channel, and the other parts play along accordingly.  Later, the drums lead into yet another practically trance inducing part where flea and john play beautiful, soaring parts in the background and the soft, sweet sounding lyrics are overdubbed with \\"La La La\\" all with effects like reverb, and echo.  Then, the last 3 minutes features the most beautiful chord transitions I have ever heard, while John'sguitar cries out within those overall chords and continues to as the song fades away.
B00005RZV4|5.0|To start with, I generaly hate live recordings as the sound is so poor that you would never want to listen to it on decent hi-fi through fear of blowing your tweeters with all of the shreeking high end and lack of base. In my opinion the only other artists who have ever done good live recordings are VH (right here right now), U2 (rattle and hum), Radiohead (I might be wrong ep)<br />I was amazed at how well music with such tight timing and precision could be replicated live. I prefer many of the live versions to the original live versions. His Trent's emotion and rage are unbelievable, I am suprised that someone can do that to their voice every night and still be able to speak.<br />If you like NIN buy this as it is excellent.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is one of the absolute best movies you will ever see period. If you are one that is way into character development, this is for you;  Tim Robbins's character, Andy, goes to prision for murder, but what starts out as a tough time turns into a gigantic conspiracy.  Full of twisted characters (the warden), characters you love to hate (Hadley), the ones you just can't help but give sympathy for their situation (Brooks and Red), and the classic on the edge not sure what to think of character (Andy).  If you are into a thought provoking drama that keeps you going for the entire length of the movie, than don't hesitate for this one.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is going to be very difficult for me. I enjoy talking about Radiohead, but it gives me a headache. So i kind of don't. Ok. to begin with, i feel that kid A is a very creative album. i feel that Radiohead are not just musical artists, but literal artists as well. They have-with their music-the ability to create images. When i listen to Kid A (the album), i feel as though it was made in a time of war-hence Idioteque. most of the songs-especially motion picture soundtrack-can create deep feelings and distorted images in your mind if you really get \\"into\\" the music. and i have done that by simply closing my eyes, and \\"seeing\\" where the music takes me. i give Radiohead alot of credit for their creativity with sounds, and alot of credit for their musical talent. I will definetly not say that i feel just like Thom, or live just like Thom, because i dont. and i dont know him. He is a totally diffrent person outside of the studio and the stage. Anyway, good luck to all those trying to understand Radiohead. I doubt you ever will unless you actually...
0140434135|3.0|it was a good book but very hard to get into. once you start reading (and understand it) its hard to put down. read this book if you have a lot of time on your hands.

0446525537|5.0|A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks is a book that has touched all my five senses. Through tears and laugher was the love story of two seniors in High School unfolded in front of me. I picked out this book in the first place because I heard a song called Cry on TV. The lyrics and the melody of Cry moved me and I later found out that the song was made for a movie called A Walk to Remember. Since the movie was not out yet, I decided to read the book based on the movie instead. I didnt think the book would be good because usually books based on movies arent that great, but I decided to give it a try anyways. And boy was I wrong! After I read the book, all the lyrics in Cry fitted together, creating an even sweeter atmosphere whenever I hear the song. A Walk to Remember is not just a typical love storyXthere are many twists and turns in the plot that leaves you speechless. With Sparkss descriptive writing, it makes feels that you are actually watching the movie, or even one of the characters in love. The love experienced by Landon and Jamie is so pure and innocence that it makes you leave the society in 2002 and go back in time to a sweeter world, 1958. The story takes place in North Carolina in a sweet little town where everybody knows everybody. This scenery creates a better feeling how it is so easy to fall in love during that timeXthe love is old-fashioned but yet so clean and sweet. Unfortunately, a tragedy happens in the end that makes ones heart wrench. Nicholas Spark guides you through the sweetest part of life because once upon reading this book, you may tie connections with similar experiences you once may have had. In this book, not only was Jamie an inspiration to Landon but an inspiration to me. This is the kind of book that you would want to read by yourself a cold day wrapped up in a blanket. Satisfaction guaranteed! =0)

B00000JMQD|3.0|I have loved this movie since the day I saw it in the theatre when I was about a year younger than Fairuza Balk was when she was in it.  I loved that they had Fairuza Balk talking about her role and the experiences she had but I found that there was one drawback.  The movie has not been closed captioned!  I didn't know that they released movies these days that are not closed captioned.  Very disapointing for my brother since he has loved this movie almost as long as I have and is hearing impaired.  I hope someday they will release a closed captioned version so he can finally hear/read everything and understand the story fully.
0553208845|5.0|All eastern religions seem to advocate a non-clinging style of living for spiritual growth. In short this is what HH says in siddhartha (As Richard Bach did in \\"Illusions\\" ).<br />Everyone would have experienced the suffering involved in resisting the destiny. The painful clinging to a relationship that is a failure, the laborous attachment to the work one doesnt like, violence associated to religious fanatism or other ideologies and the suffering associated with the death of a loved one are but examples of problem associated with attachment.The human mind seems to believe that nothing will be fruitful if it does not bind itself to things around it ( this situation is beautifully explained in \\"The Zen in the art of archery\\"). It struggles with the past and worrys about the future and trys not to let things in hand slip. But it reality, this is what takes the goal away from our focus. Bagavad gita says \\" what ever is going to happen has already happened. You are nothing but a messenger about to convey that message to the world through your action. So, perform your duty without worrying about the result\\". Whether it is logical or scientific is irrelevent (quantum physicists might say it is very much logical and scientific) but everyone will agree that they perform best when there is little interference from the mind. And that is what is all about detachment-to take reality as it is, to be completly aware of the reality that is around you and to keep moving, keep living. And this again is not a virtue for monks and saints but a must for anyone who wants to perform best in life. And just like any other art (and the art of loving) this has to be cultivated with patience, perseverence and practice for effective living. In fact only a truly loving person who respects himself and others will earnestly try to be detached in life. This is because he will know detachement is what is required for his and other's happiness and effectiveness. Siddartha is the story of a man's spiritual jouney that culminates with this realization.itual jouney that culminates with this realization.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Don't listen to the music elitists that bash this album, they are only jealous that this band is getting some much deserved attention, cause they put out a great record.

B00005RDSM|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!<br />I hadnt watched Peter Pan in about 15 years, but it somehow remained one of my favourites. I got the Special Edition DVD last night and immediatly ripped the Amazon box and the wrapping..... I watched the movie....and suddenly I remembered I could fly.<br />This is a fantastic story, where as a child you can relate, and certainly wish Peter will lose his shadow in your bedroom.<br />This version has also some very interesting features, like language tracks in French and Spanish (its really funny to hear the characters in another language), commentaries, games and more!<br />And... after watching it again, and again, and again.... it still remains as one of my favourites!!
B0000027RL|3.0|Okay, fine, I didn't want to take time out to review Ten, but if I hear one more person compare Nirvana to Pearl Jam (and dissing whichever one) I'm gonna crack. <BR>First, anyone who even compares Pearl Jam to Nirvana shows their ignorance. If the two of them weren't both from Seattle, NO ONE would even have the slightest idea to compare them. PJ is not alternative, it's commercial, especially on Ten. Nirvana is way weirder and less commercial. This is not a bad thing for PJ, since it makes people like my dad (a Zep and Pink Floyd fan) love PJ and loathe Nirvana. But there's us who aren't crazy about commercialism. PJ is corporate rock, and derivative ballads like Black prove this. <BR>Finally, would you still have a classic without Smells like teen spirit? Probably not, but you would have a really good album, because in my humble opinion, all the songs on Nevermind have quality. Songs like Alive and Jeremy are firstly, not classics, and second, are in my opinion the only good songs on this album. And 2 songs does not a good album make. <BR>I like No Code and Yield cause they are at least an attempt to speak from the heart instead of worrying about being catchy. But Ten in itself is no more than a slightly higher quality Bon Jovi.<br />This is just my opinion, so it's subjective. But an objective bottom line is, PJ and Nirvana are impossible to compare. I mean come on, one has to be deaf if they can't catch the \\"classic-70's-rock\\"-type influence on Pearl Jam, and a totally punk, and sometimes early-Beatles-type influence on Nirvana. Sheesh.

B00005R2IS|3.0|I don't recommend this edition. Ok, the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.<BR>In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok, maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is the best DVD I have seen!  All people who think it is bad must be ignorant or something.  The DVD has so many extra feautures and that absolutely makes up for the terrible acting by Jake Lloyd and Ray Park as a short stub villian
B00004Z459|5.0|When I first heard the song &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, and &quot;Crawling&quot;, I thought they were pretty good.  But then I heard &quot;In The End&quot; and I rushed out, bought the CD, and I've been playing it a lot ever since.  Chester, Mike, Brad, Phoenix(he returned after the album was released), Joseph, and Rob have successfully blended many differnt sound together to create a superb album.  I look forward to hearing how their sound evolves.
0767805712|4.0|Since most other reviewers already gave you most of what you need to know, ill toss in the other parts you need to know.  Namely, if you are a fan of science fiction, you need to see this movie.  It's entertaining, thoughtprovoking and at the same time, cautionary.  The events depicted in \\"the not so distant future\\" are just that.  Literally around the corner. <BR>The cinemamatography is beautiful as well.  Filmed in (I've been there, its in california but I can't remember what it's called) a Frank Lloyd Wright creation the film is shot to look, well, retro (the future will be retro?)  but its really, for lack of better words, cool looking.  Stark figures stand against orange backrounds, the sun reflects off a field of solar panels, an upside down ocean is shot through the corner of a glass wall, etc.  Gattaca was shot incredibly stylish.  And the idea that the main backdrop for a futuristic society was a building created and desinged in the 50's is interesting as well.  <BR>If you are into science fiction, you ought to see this movie.  It's highly original in look and feel, and it explores the \\"what if?\\" of a very forsee able future.  Its everything a science fiction movie should be.  Fresh, original, not bogged down by special effects, action, or just stupid star wars/star trek wannabe [junk].  It' s refreshing.  I wish more movies were like this.<BR>(note: The deleted scenes probably should have been left in, save the deleted moral collage.  It wouldn't have worked as part of the film, though it is however, worth watching after the film.  I also believe there is a dvd version of this movie avaliable with more special features, which I would recomend purchasing over this one.)
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is a great story of what can be accomplished if you believe in yourself.  My child now want to go to Harvard because of this movie!

Here is an example of unique talent and an ability to express one's self to the highest degree without fear of failure or poor reception by others. <BR>These young men are very talented, and it's a shame that Christian Rock has closed their doors on them. I don't think I have ever heard a stronger message in song, that would make me<BR>think of what God has made and the beauty of it. Don't miss out<BR>on this opportunity to listen to poetry wrapped in music, so sweet and melodic.
B000002542|5.0|When I was still learning about Journey, I never knew there was any music from the band prior to Steve Perry until I bought the Journey \\"Time 3\\" box set. In it, I found pieces of early Journey when Gregg Rolie was the lead singer and I was instantly captivated. I knew I had to check Journey's roots out, and \\"Journey\\" is one of the first CD's I ever owned. My dad bought it for me when I got my first CD player.    Journey's self-titled debut is an amazing album. It is a perfect example of classic fusion rock craftsmanship, and is delivered with a unique variety of twists and sounds. Neal Schon's guitar is so energizing and full of power. He is truely magnificant, bringing forth an intense, screeching, melodic down-pour of solid rock perfection through his strings to vibrate through your ears and echo throughout your body. Then you have the relentless, thunderous drums of Aynsley Dunbar, thick with jamming effects that work flawlessly with Schon's guitar to throw you a rock 'n roll hammering punch like none other. Dunbar never ceases to make you want to bang your head. Gregg Rolie's vocals are magnificant, intense, and soulful. He is one of the best keyboardists around, and his catchy melodies gel so well with Schon's guitar, Dunbar's drums, and of course, the powerful bass of Ross Valory, and the spectacular rhythm guitaring of George Tickner.    The album begins with one of my all-time favorite early Journey songs, \\"Of A Lifetime.\\" Check out the sizzling and smoking guitar work from Schon, and the jamming drum thumps from Dunbar. Within this feel-good song comes Rolie's soft, free-flowing lyrics. Ross Valory's thick, loud bass will give your ears a ride. This is definitely a party-like song, in which true fusion rock talent is shown. They were definitely having a good time with this one.    \\"In The Morning Day\\" has always been one of my favorites, because I love the melodic chords from guitarist Schon and keyboardist Gregg Rolie. Like with \\"Of A Lifetime,\\" the song starts out smooth and flowing with Gregg's soft lyrics, before an eruption of guitars, keyboards, and drums.    \\"Khoutek\\" is an instrumental jammer. The main melody repeats over and over behind Neal Schon's screeching guitar and Gregg Rolie's swirling keyboards. Schon and Rolie seem to be taking turns showing off their talent and feeding off one another in the song which makes it very unique. Schon, Rolie, Valory, Tickner and Dunbar are fantastic here, even though it's not one of my favorite songs.    \\"To Play Some Music\\" probably has the most lyrics of all the songs. Rolie is a pretty good singer, and it's just a fun rock song simply about enjoying playing music and bringing joy to people in the process.    \\"Topaz\\" is another instrumental jammer and one of my very favorites. Again, the song starts very quiet with some soft Neal Schon chords and Rolie keyboard notes. Then Dunbar eases in with the drumming until the song gets quicker and quicker and then erupts in a groovy rock masterpiece of catchy guitar hooks and chords and drum beats. This song perks me up every time I listen to it.    Journey tones it down a bit with \\"In My Lonely Feeling (Conversations).\\" It is probably my least favorite song on the album. It has kind of a ho-hum , blue kind of feel to it. But at the end, the song starts jamming again. Rolie does a nice job with vocals. In virtually every album I hear, there is one song that I can't find a lot to say about. This one is one of them.    The album finishes with my favorite on the album, \\"Mystery Mountain.\\" It is a rocking, free-flowing song that gives you a laid-back feel. I love Rolie's keyboards in this song, and Valory's bass really adds to the overall atmosphere of this piece. Of course Schon does his usual flawless guitar work. Rolie provides some atmospheric lyrics as well.    \\"Journey\\" is a complete, classic rock-jamming package that started the \\"Journey\\" of Journey. While the style is far from the kind of music they performed in the late 70's and through the 80's with Steve Perry, as well as the current style with Steve Augeri, it is still an album that is a must for all die-hard rock fans. This is pure rock that will give you a fine dose of ear-candy. These are definitve examples of Journey's best early work!! Don't pass this album up!!
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is the most amazing Celtic songstress, I have ever heard. From her 1st album to her latest CD, I am always humbled by her ability to make me forget everything else and just immerse myself in her voice and the sounds that accompany it. She can make any bad mood lift and any hard moment disappear. I can listen to her on a rainy day or a sunny day, no matter what else is going on around you, her angelic sounds are appropriate. I cannot compare her talent to very many other artists. This lady is a \\"DIVA\\" in her own right, along with Celine Dion, and the other true talents, we have all come to know and love. Don't let the opportunity to have this one in your collection, pass you by. If you own it, play it often. If you don't own it, buy it now and keep it in your player, after you first listening, you will be \\"hooked\\" on Enya....ENJOY!!!!
0706415639|5.0|Though &quot;Little Men&quot; was the first of the March family books that I read, when I was around seven, I was just as easily drawn by and to &quot;Little Women&quot;. Not so with &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the second book in the series (or &quot;Jo's Boys&quot;, the last book, for that matter).<br />For a long time, there was something about &quot;Good Wives&quot; that I did not like, but could not name. Now that I am in college, learning from and loving this novel for the first time, I know exactly what was once so off-putting to me: &quot;Good Wives&quot; is about changing and growing up--things that were completely alien to me in elementary school.<br />In this book, Meg struggles to be a poor man's wife and a good mother--tasks more trying than being a dutiful daughter and a kind older sister. Jo learns to hold her &quot;abominable tongue&quot; (a slight disappointment, admittedly) and aspires to be more like Beth. Amy comes to terms with money, her limitations, and what she really wants from life. Laurie drops his rascal's streak and resolves to become more serious. In the saddest twist of the story, Beth dies.<br />The things that happen to the March girls (and the Laurence boy) are no longer the happy sketches of youthful scrapes, pranks and plays. By the second chapter, &quot;The First Wedding&quot;, the first of them sets foot in the world of grown-ups, where actions have long-term consequences and one must make life-defining choices on one's own. The events in these books are sobering life experiences.<br />Much of &quot;Good Wives&quot; is made up of lengthy narrations--many passages quite preachy--that mostly illustrate what life-changing epiphanies the characters are having. Side by side with descriptions of the setting, background and new characters, are descriptions of life's crossroads. The characters also no longer bump into each other as much as before (except in certain delightful chapters); afer all, they _are_ learning to leave the nest and flyto where life is calling. &quot;Good Wives&quot; is also a novel filled with goodbyes.<br />Despite my initial dislike of this book and its more serious, sober air (though the chapter &quot;Daisy and Demi&quot; does give a hint of the frolicsome things to come in &quot;Little Men&quot;), I give it Five Stars because of the way it probed deeper: it explored not only the intricacies of family ties, friendships, and first loves, but also the characters relationships to the world, to society, and to themselves. Ultimately, though the innocent joys of childhood become completely lost to Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, and Laurie, the five earn a new happiness--something closer to glory.
6305311463|4.0|As you may have noticed there are alot of movies produced now adays with huge budgets huge actors and huge plot holes. these movies include independence day, mib, the rock, armageddon, pearl harbor, wild wild west, godzilla. the list goes on forever.  Notice alot of the same people directed, or starred in those movies. point is they were all made with a fast paced plot that makes it enjoyable (exclude WWWest) but when it is all said and done was it a good movie, for me, indepence day and mib were, the rock and godzilla were not, of course WWWest was awefull but nobody liked that flick so its not really worth mentioning. Sometimes because of the actors that are playing the roles make the movie funny enough, cause we know the action will be good the movie becomes good. I think armageddon was good. not very good, not great, but good, good+ maybe. and in the world of over the top blockbusters thats all you can really ask for.  if you noticed the first half played like a comedy and the 2nd half like an action/suspence show.  I liked both parts. (...) Oh yea i forgot to mention i thought pearl harbor was bad.  I really really enjoyed it the first time i saw it, now i dont as much but i am going to drive an hour and a half to get the criterion collection of armageddon for a decent price, locally its 50.00 clams ouch,i can get it for 24.96 or some similiar price.  Liv tyler is crossed eyed though i will agree to that, and not that pretty, and not a very good actress (no disrespect liv, keep truckin!!!!) Ben is not a good actor and i didnt really realize that until i watched some special features on jay and silent bob strike back. im still debateing on buying good will hunting, maybe maybe not. i do have to say i really notice and hate the time frame used in the last 30 minutes of the show, or last 13 minutes maybe where they keep saying can you dig this deep of a hole in some amount of time then after they do that, we got 38 minutes to get the bomb down there, then after than we got 18 minutes to lift off. seems a bit unrealistic but oh yea were talking about armageddon. oh yea one last complaint at one point billy bob thorton tells willis to tell the press he has never failed, willis says he has never quit and billy said that will have to do. but later willis say \\"i have never missed a depth i was aiming for\\" or paraphrase you have never failed, does anybody understand the neverending stream of (...) that flows from my fingers. ok i liked it goodnight

B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD was one of the best CDs that came out in 2001.  What a fresh new talent....so soulful and meaningful. I was really disappointed in the Grammys and probably will never watch again. India.Arie definitley deserved to win at least one award....nominated for seven awards and didn't win one.  Reminds me of the year the Color Purple was up for 11 awards and didn't win a thing.  It's a real shame, but India please keep making your beautiful music....your fans adore you.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Whatever you are doin' right now, drop it!  Get yourself over to see this movie ASAP!  Take all your friends and loved ones with ya!  Its GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!  [Violent though.] Are some things really better in the post-September 11th world?  This film is really something to get excited about.  The actual men from the 7th Calvary who fought in this battle gave the film 70 - 80 per cent historical accuracy.  They are such decent guys! The film will be hard to beat.  <br />Only one drawback--It is partially dedicated to our enemies.Three cheers for this heroic film!!
B00003CXXS|4.0|“I just love it when dinos eat people,” effects maestro Stan Winston says with obvious glee in his commentary for the Collector’s Edition DVD of “Jurassic Park III.” Winston’s people eaters are once again the stars of the “Jurassic” franchise, but this time out they’ve evolved into voracious scenery chewers as well. Not only are the beasts far more lifelike than any Winston and his collaborators have created, but some display acting chops via individual voices, looks and expressions, the filmmakers say. These advances in dino drama are on full view in the special sections of the “Jurassic Park III” DVD, giving viewers a chance to dig as deeply into the creative process as they wish. The DVD comes widescreen or full frame, with both 5.1 DTS and Dolby sound.<br /> The picture is up to big-budget action film standards, with deep greens and nicely saturated blues predominant. The sound mix roars along with the critters, the subwoofer steadily amping up the anxiety level. The 5.1 mix effectively renders the action without calling attention to itself. The “Jurassic” team’s craft is examined in several special DVD features: “Turntables” offer computer images of various dinosaurs that can be viewed from all sides. A featurette on the making of the dinos focuses on new beasts such as the Spinosaurus -- but repeats too much material from the so-so “making of” promo. Tours of Stan Winston Studios and ILM give more detailed insights into the creative process.<br />The disc features some great scenes of the cast and crew working with the mechanical dinosaurs that were later coupled with the CG creatures. Winston, Taylor and several colleagues provide the film commentary, which starts strong but runs out of gas by the third act. Much time is spent pointing out which scenes are live action, which are CG and which are “effects quilts.” Even the effects pros seemed confused by the blend at times. Unfortunately, the “Jurassic” DVD also breaks some new ground in promotion. A special feature link leads to screens full of pitches for Universal parks and “Jurassic” products. The carney approach grates, lowering the overall level of what is otherwise a pretty good DVD.aks some new ground in promotion.

0440219078|4.0|Of all books I have read, I strongly feel that this one ranks up in the top three.  I feel as though it was a very well written story which, if you think about it, it isn't the easiest topic to write about.  Well, at least I can't see how anyone can come up with a story about such an abstract concept as the way that the people in the novel lived.  Nonetheless, this novel was written masterfully.  <br /> The only flaw that I found was at the very end.  While I was reading it, I noticed I was running out of pages.  However, I was not running out of questions.  I feel as though this book really leaves the reader hanging on a lot of questions which, I for one, would have liked to have answered.  I actually went to my friend the next day who read it and took his answers to my questions, even though he can not be fully sure if he is correct or not.  However, it eased my mind to have at least some sort of answers.  Other than the ending, I feel as though this book was really well written and I would recommend it to anyone, young and old, as long as they enjoy reading good books.
0451204530|3.0|I adore Ken Follett novels. I agree that he is the most romantic of all thriller writers. This one is well written, fluid, taut and touching at times. However, this does give the impression of having been written in a hurry. It is upto a standard - as most novels by the mature Ken Follett are - but falls short of doing adequate justice to the plot.<BR>I would give it around 3.5 stars.
0060930187|4.0|This book is interesting and well-written. It's definitely worth purchasing and adding to your collection.
B000025RAU|5.0|This is the kind of movie many screen writers wish they could write. It's so beautifully, intricately plotted.<BR>The acting and directing is flawless - this remain my favorite Jack Nicholson role, for which all his later excesses could be forgiven. Polanski at the height of his powers. Frankly I can't imagine living without this movie within reach. It requires repeated viewing.
630280082X|3.0|But unfortunately we have Ralph Macchio. He's so annoying in this flick that you just can't stand watching it. The rest of the cast is great and Steve Vai is awesome in the duel at the end. Great story, great music, and outstanding climax, but it has Ralph and when he isn't painfully hamming it up, he's just annoying. They gotta do a remake.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|To take this movie seriously would be to miss the joke entirely. Of course the jokes in 'Scary Movie' are heavily inspired by so many ridiculous horror movies that it's difficult to give it points for originality. But it gets a perfect rating for mockery of some recent camp horror movies such as &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. It also makes a few comic references to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, and a few other films. The Wayans do what they do best- take elements of our fickle pop culture and add a comic twist to it and this time they've successfully taken it a step further.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie's did it again... She has unleashed another batch of perfected pop.  From the opening beats of &quot;More More More&quot; to the boiling closing track &quot;Burning Up&quot;, Kylie takes us on a breezy trip thru her electro-pop world.<BR>The album has a glossy kind of retro 80s feel to it... Yet, with a fresh twist...<BR>If you are looking for an album that will take your mind off of your troubles, and that will get your blood pumping at the same time... Look no further... Catch Kylie's &quot;Fever&quot;!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I can't tell you why this film adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr's dark novel did not get more recognition. What I can tell you is that there has never been more remarkable nor a more disturbing film where drugs (diet pils/speed, cocaine, crack) is just as important of a character as the actors. Director Darren Aronofsky uses a quick-paced, chaotic directing style that apparently irked industry moguls because it may have seemed a bit too showy. However, any other style would be pretentious and too fluffy for the grim subject matter at hand. It's grueling to watch the characters, superbly played by Jared Leto, Shawn Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly (Oscar nominee for her role in the more recent 'A Beautiful Mind') spiral down their black holes to meet their resepctive fates. Finally Ellen Burstyn's performance is absolutely riveting as Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow battling the bulge with 'diet pills' who's desparate for her son's love. She pulled off a performance that was much more challenging than that of a certain Oscar winner for her portrayal of a fiery legal aide uncovering an environmental scandal by a corporate monster...I disgress. Be sure to rent \\"Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory\\" when you see this film. You'll definitely need it as a pick-me-up after witnessing 'Requiem For A Dream'.
B00003CXQY|5.0|So we all know the typical Disney story. Lots of magic, even a few tear jerker moments, a theme song, and let's not forget lots of singing in between. Now, for those of you who actually like the songs every 5 seconds (but hey I actually like Disney songs) you might not like this movie because I can easily recall there being only one song with 2 different versions one at the beginning and one at the end. So what makes this movie a non traditional Disney movie in my opinion is because there is a lack of songs (because being older now you do notice a trend), and the humor of this movie is very hard to explain. It's just so different. This has honestly got to be one of the funniest Disney movies I've ever seen. The animation is wonderfull, the characters are so lovable (yes that includes Yzma), and yet Disney still manages to make sure you know it's still a Disney movie. So while it may not be your average Disney movie, it's still has that charm...and yes, there is a theme song towards the end. Don't think they'd let you get away with that :)
B00005UKKF|3.0|Britney's form is pleasing to the eye and she can get her groove on.  The girl can dance.  However, I'm curious to see if she can sing *and* dance at the same time.<br />This show's got it all- bursts of fire, cascades of waterfalls, glitter, bubbles, a big giant music box.  In the end, this wasn't really a concert.  It was a show, a spectacle.<br />I actually enjoyed watching it, but it was more about the choreography, the dancing, and the eye popping effects than anything the music.  If you like Britney or just like her style of performing and want to watch an upbeat show of dancing, wild costumes, and lots of sparkly extras, then get this 'concert.'<br />However, in some instances it's just painfully obvious that she's lipsynching.  <br />But, the girl has stage presence.  If you can take it as just a show and not so much a concert, then this might be what you're looking for.  It's good for entertainment, but not so much for real musical appreciation.  If you expect something along the lines of Madonna or Sarah Brightman-esque authenticity in concerts, you may want to pass Britney up.<br />Hope it helps :)
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is hilarious! But watch out if you are someone who clings to Roman Catholic practices religiously. This movie will probably be condemned by many as blasphemy, but its a wickedly funny road to hell. Take the movie as it was intended and you'll have a great time. I enjoyed it, and I'm catholic.
B000002KCF|5.0|Hello,<br />What few people realize is that the Art of Tea was recorded live - which is pretty amazing. <br />The recording quality is excellent. <br />Another thing a lot of people don't realize is that Franks' band is the exact same band that backed up Joni Mitchell in the early-mid 70s - Joe Sample, Larry Carlton, the Brecker brothers, John Guerin on drums, etc.<br />The Art of Tea is a classic jazz/rock album, with a bit of tease and fantastic vocals. It's both great early morning and late evening music, best appreciated with a fine partner and excellent wine.
B000006YBO|5.0|One of the best albums that I own and I own a ton!!<BR>I have played this over and over again and I've never gotten sick of it. The next DOWN is being released on March 26th, 2002....
B00005RVRL|4.0|I purchased this CD just for the 5 live CD that came with it. I had already bought the Everday CD when it first came out.  I was very pleased to find out once i got the 5 live CD that 4 of the 5 live tracks are from the 7-7-01 show in Chicago! This was awesome because i was at that show. The only live track that isn't from Chicago is &quot;I did it&quot;, i don't know where they got that one. So i if you're like me and you love the live versions of DMB's songs, then buy this album,
B00005RYKU|1.0|the glass house...smashes...this movie is so bad...if i could give it zero stars i would....there was nothing good about this movie except the ending...the characters were dull...and boring..the movie was dragged so much you could take the house away and bring it back and they still wouldnt be anywhere..if you want a movie that will put you to sleep this is it...dont buy this movie it is a waist of money...rent it if you dare...but be warned it is terrible....
B000003TA4|5.0|nevermind the greatest album ever ive been having this cd since it came out and till this day i can listen to it and it feels like if its the first time im listening to it even though i hear it everyday. I guarantee if you buy this cd you will not regret it.
B00005RJ1U|5.0|This movie is great!  The best horror flick I have seen since forever.  The movie is a brother and sister relationship (Trish, Gina Philips, and Darry, Justin Long) which makes this movie even better to understand.  This movie has automatic suspence with it starting out with terror in the first 5 minutes.  <br />It starts out with Trish and Darry taking the long way home which turns into a nightmare.  They spot a shabby looking man dumping bodies down a sewer pipe in the back of an old church.  Darry being as curious as he is turns back to see if there were any survivers, not knowing the horror that lies at the end, or even the horror that comes with seeing what he has.  <br />It's a chase through the whole movie with this goulish creature and these two teens.  I would have to say Justin Long did a great job on acting, he makes the movie worth seeing.  <br />Just so I don't spoil the ending, I'm not going to say but ask you one question....<BR>\\"What do you think he wants, and from who?\\"<br />Jeepers Creepers where'd you get those peepers.... Jeepers Creepers where'd you get those EYES.<br />See this movie!  It's worth watching.... over and over again!
B00005Y7AW|4.0|Boy, this album! I have to admit I found his first CD a little hard to take, too much show and not enough tunes, if you see what I mean. However, something about his vocal style drew me in, and after putting it off for a long while I got myself 'Poses'. Much 'simpler' in terms of being more traditional rock/pop, this is full of great songs that just get more and more persistant, gradually worming their way into your mind. And his voice is mesmerising, haunting and melancholic without being oppresive. There are of course real up beat moments like the greatest hit single that will never be; California. Anyway, do yourself a favour and get this.
0780021967|5.0|Then get hold of Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;. Having received Criterion's release of &quot;Notorious&quot;, and being blown away by all of the extra features and practically pristine print, I later got &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; for my birthday. Among the extras  are digital copies of press books, lobby cards, and even a radio broadcast. As for the film itself...no one but Hitchcock could weave so many events - mayhem at a music hall, mistaken identity, foreign spies, chases through moving trains, mixups at political rallies - in a clear, clever film which is never crammed or labored. And what is more of a marvel is that all of these events - and many more - play out in a film which is just under an hour and one half! Alfred Hitchcock filmed &quot;The Thirty -Nine Steps&quot; in 1935, early in his career. Genius, and even prodigy of film.

B00003CXXP|4.0|This is a very good film, not great, but very good! The effects are phenomenal and the cinematography is superb! The plot drags<br />and is very predictable but well executed. Haley Joel is a child star to watch as he gets older. Super Ted, the animatronic teddybear is the real star of the film. His antics and mannerisms are scene stealers. I liked him so much I bought two of the robotic Super Teds from Hasbro!!! If you like fairytales, then get this DVD for all the extras on the 2nd disk. If you're prone to crying at sad endings, have a box of Kleenex with you when you watch it. You want to grab onto the screen and take the teddybear right into your arms. The acting is very good and this wide screen edition is the best way to view it since nothing will be \\"chopped off\\" the edges and excluding some of the great background scenery. It's a nice addition to any collector of special effects films. This is classified as science fiction, but it is more of fantasy than fiction. Enjoy!!
B000002KIK|5.0|Why 'little'? Well, because of 'Vol 4', 'Sabotage', and so on... It doesn't mean anything, though; in fact, 'little' is an understatement. This album is refreshing! Still sounds great after all these years! And it even captured a younger audience. Underrated, unjustly put down, this is a glorious conclusion of the classic and unrepeated Osbourne era. I must say, I listen to this wonder on a daily basis and still can't get enough of it... It is the music, of course, the maturity of the band, a solid Ozzy performance, a unique feeling and some amazing sounds. Experimentation, synthesizers, improvisational grand piano, saxophones... Where else can you hear an instrumental like 'Breakout'?. Not musical taste, the critics said. Well, there is a powerful taste here, which goes all the way back to the grand-band jazz! Listen to this piece carefully, with the volume turned high: Only then you can capture its meaning... And the rest of the songs? Sheer delight, I wouldn't know where to start: The title track is a great kick-off song, fast, powerful and captivating. 'Junior's Eyes' totally captured my heart, when my best friend died in a motorcycle accident in Europe many years ago... 'Johnny Blade', the portrait of a street-fighter, is so powerful and convincing that makes you wonder why this album received so many bad reviews. As I mentioned in my review of 'Technical Ecstasy' the social references of NSD are quite prominent, however, this CD is also spirituality at its best. This spirituality is beautifully expressed in 'Air dance', the mystical masterpiece of the album. Nice piano work, haunting, acoustic/electric combinations, followed by a delightful boogie conclusion.<BR>As I hinted above, a comparison with some of the previous classic Sabbath albums would be unfair. This is not exactly heavy metal. Experimental hard rock may be the best description of NSD. A new musical direction, perhaps. The Sabbath have always been pioneers of the genre. And what genre? Practicallytheir own...<BR>'Shock Wave': Pleasant, strong, changes themes a few times. 'Over to You': Starts upbeat, turns to melancholic, with the haunting piano of 'Air Dance' continuing here... A nice song. 'Swinging the Chain' and 'A Hard Road' are generally considered the 'lowest' moments of the CD. I won't argue with the statement, I still like, though, the beat and raw sound of the closing 'Swinging the Chain', Ward's vocals and the harmonica that hasn't played since 'The Wizard'. What else is there to say? Only this: Don't miss this album for anything, or you'll be missing one of the most innovative and trully amazing Sabbath albums ever and also, one of the best hard rock originals ever created. Enjoy!
B000001ED1|4.0|This album is most famous for &quot;One of Us&quot; (what if God were one of us?).  It must have been a shock for fans to buy this album for the pop hit and wind up with a very good blues album instead.<br />Joan Osborne is a blues/rock singer.  She has some excellent songs on this album.  The songs are well written.  There is great musical accompaniment to the songs, good hard driving blues-rock.  For the most part, she has a good blues voice.<br />The only problem is that her range is limited.  When she goes outside of her comfort zone, the results can be bad.  On &quot;Let's Get Naked&quot; her voice just drones. The song has nice sentiments but her vocals ruin them.  On a few other songs her voice is just irritating.<br />This album is 60 minutes long, and could have been made better by eliminating some of the annoying tracks.<br />She is much better live, where she emphasizes her strengths and doesn't push beyond her talents.
B000000OF6|4.0|In some ways Greatest Hits is better and the sequencing of the UK catalogue, as seen here, seems to be better organised. Here are Queen's best selling singles in the UK and US up to 1991 and contains great classics like 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love', 'A Kind of Magic', 'We Will Rock You', 'We Are the Champions' and 'I Want to Break Free'
B00004TH83|1.0|Firstly,I must say I'm her big fan and I admire her voice,but if you compare this album with her two FRENCH albums &quot;Pure&quot; and &quot;Nue&quot;,this one is BAD because of those songs which sounds so ordinary,not special at all...
B00003CXXP|5.0|When I first rented the DVD I didnt know if I was going to like this too much (I hate that Star Trek, [etc.]), so I thought I would give it a chance. The movie was 10x more than I anticipated! The movie is flat out a milestone in Spielberg's list of greats. Haley Joel Osment deserved atleast a Best Actor nomination. The movie is all around good and the dvd has plenty of goodies.
B000002JKA|5.0|Wow! . . .I am a Die hard Rush Fan and I love this album! Good quality recording and Solid musicianship. I believe this is their finest studio work. If you like, Kansas, Queensryche, Genisis, Rush, or If you like other albums by this group, buy this one for sure!<br />And the meek shall inherit the earth! n.p. 2112
B000008LUN|4.0|With the PHENOMENOM release Michael Schenker joined UFO. This was a turning point for the band as they also were signed by a major label for world wide release. Earlier, Schenkerless, albums sounded good, but seriously lacked something. That problem was now solved. Schenker, with Mogg, Parker, and Way began to sound like a great rock band with something any band would love to have, a great guitarist and writer. I've had many friends constantly talk about the incredible chords Schenker plays; I can only say it sounds phenomenal!<br />As much as I like this realease, I have given it only four stars, because the band has done better, and there is a lack of hit material here. Don't get me wrong the tracks all sound good, but even after 25+ years of listening to this only 4 songs ever stick in my mind and I only ever put three of them on recordings. I've got to admit, though, that &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; and &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; made a buttload of 8 tracks and cassette tapes. &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot; is one of those all-time great tunes and the remake on WALK ON WATER is great, too! The other song I especially like is &quot;Time on My Hands&quot;. &quot;Too Young to Know&quot; is also a good song. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the other songs, they just don't have what these four have to offer. This is certainly one of UFO's 5 best albums, so, if you're into great guitar work, you should own this.
B00005JA2B|4.0|This is a good album. If you like progressive rock similar to 80's Genisis or 80's Rush, You'll enjoy this. Allot of the songs have multi-melodic lines and switch back and fourth from soft ballad sounds to pulsing rock &amp; roll. You'll be tappin' right along. It also has some classics like carry on wayword son. Great disc!
B0000025DR|5.0|This has to be my favorite album from ELO. It shows their complete versatility and their coming of age. The whole band shines here, even though it seems that Jeff Lynne is prepared to steal the spotlight. FACE THE MUSIC finally had ELO on a multitude of radio stations from AM to AOR. \\"Fire on High\\" was even used by ABC's Wide World of Sports for years. Most people remember \\"Strange Magic\\" and \\"Evil Woman\\" from airplay in 1975 and 1976. Both were huge hits and allowed the band to breath a sigh of relief. The limelight was there and Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy, and the others were standing firmly in it.<br />Beyond what you heard on the radio or TV, even though you may not of known it was ELO, is music that is very respectable. \\"Poker\\" is one of the harder rockers the band had done up to that time and it is  my all-time favorite. With ELO you always get the great strings, keyboards, vocals, and harmonies; FACE THE MUSIC is no different, except it set the standard that they would have to live up to for the rest of their careers. Other great songs include \\"Nightrider\\" and \\"Waterfall\\". Not just another ELO release, this is the pinnacle of their success. The other perfect disc I would point to from them would be OUT OF THE BLUE. This is atypical 70's music, but is none-the-less great!
0399226907|5.0|This book is so popular in our house! It's nice to see that the board book has all the charm of the paper version, so little ones can enjoy this classic story with beautiful illustrations.
6305537321|4.0|ALthough that is what the jacket cover says it to be.<br />Inspired to watch by \\"Sex and the City\\" season finale :) I immediately bought this DVD to hear the song \\"Moon River\\" I have heard much hoopla about this movie and it says on the back that it is a Romantic Comedy.... Don't kill me for saying this but I didn't find this a comedy. I enjoyed it but when I got it I bought it to enjoy with my 11 year old daughter, the subject matter wasn't as light as I thought it would be. Audrey Hepburn was BEYOND beautiful and her potrayal of \\"Holly Golightly\\" was breathtaking, George Peppard, WOW what a hunk!! and perfect for the kept man, This wasn't something I could sit down with a 11 year old and not explain to her the other innuendos going on throughout the movie.<br />Had it read a dramatic flick I would have known what to expect that song is so Sad... and when she sang it on her fire escape it made me wistful, and miss New York City. Still a keeper for a collector like me but I will have to wait till my daughter is older to share this with her.
0452282152|1.0|This book was TRITE, unconvincng in dialoque and time. The premise was intriguing at first, but the story fell apart when she began discribing the painters life, and the way he worked. Even her vocabulary of the about painting and his glazing technic was nonsence. The silliness of her relationship in the household irritated me rather than intrigue me. I have read this basic story line a thousand time, in a thousand books, and alot of them were better written than this one.I wasted four hours of my life reading this nonsence. This was supposed to have been about about Vermeer and it wasn't, his name and painting was used as a hook by the author to sell her book.
B000006XSD|4.0|This album gets a lot of flack, but it has always charmed me. The title Track is a great look at alcholic self-denial (I'll wind up swearin', drunk and dyin'--but that's a long long way from today) or can just be taken as a good rockin' tune. It's Hot Tonight and Roadrats (inspiration for the movie Roadie) are two more straight-on rockers. But this album has some really interesting and unusual tracks such as Ubangi Stomp-- which is a remake of an old 50s rockabilly classic, Damned If You Do-- which is a country cheatin' song, (No More) Love At Your Convenience-- a disco ballad, I Never Wrote Those Songs-- a soft jazz look at denial, My God-- a serious choral rendition of Alice's religious upbringing, and King of the Silver Screen-- which is something that must be heard. I guess it's sort of a spoof of Hollywood musicals. . . it's a lot of fun.<br />The highlight of the album is the US#12 hit song, You and Me. This is Alice's prettiest ballad. I am sure many people have heard it and never had a clue it was Alice Cooper. This is my favorite song on the album, but in my humble opinion every song on this album is a treat!
B000002AEN|5.0|I just wrote a review of The Best of Mississippi John Hurt. I'm now listening to the original Okeh sessions for the first time. Wow!<br />The aforementioned CD and this gem show him at his sad-happy picking and storytelling best. I just love when he stops singing and let's the guitar finish the sentence. An incredible relaxed energy. Ain't No Tellin' and Stack O' Lee are my favorites; but it's all gold, baby
B00003CXTG|1.0|The actual recreation of the bombing of Peal Harbor, as breathtaking and technologically marvelous as it was, was not enough to save this dopey movie. Horrible writing, a cliche-ridden plot and some phone-it-in performances gave many scenes an almost comical flare. More than once during the first thrity minutes did I have to elbow my wife to stop laughing or making cracks at the WB/UPN teen drama-like dialogue.<br />It's not the concept of the love triangle as the movie's secondary plot that's the problem. It's that it's a horribly done love triangle. They went full tilt for a Titanic-type love story and failed miserably. Instead of pulling at the heart strings, the movie only manages to by sappy - and at times, very funny.<br />Great special effects. Bad movie.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Q: How did a low-budget 60's t.v. series make the leap to the big screen without becoming a campy, big-budget flop? A: Robert Wise. <br />Just imagine if the Shatner-directed &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; had been the first (instead of the 5th) in the series. It might have been the last.<br />By tackling an epic story with a thoughtful and serious tone, Wise enabled the subsequent feature films to take far more latitude without the risk of being dismissed out of hand as silly and trivial.<br />Some of the Star Trek films are a bit ridiculous, but we can always anticipate the next one that aspires to the mark set by Robert Wise.
B00005NW02|5.0|Forget the labels (Nu Metal?  -- are we Yiddish or just can't spell too good?), forget the comparisons to the mediocre market filler that poses as today's cutting edge rock -- this is the real thing.  The two singles, Chop Suey and Toxicity, blow everything else off the radio, and the rest isn't far behind.  Unlike 99% of today's noise bands, SOAD understands that lyricism and power can coexist, and each is made more potent from the combination.  The best songs snarl and pound, and then soar into terrific melodic passages -- and this guy can sing, unlike just about anyone else out there today.<br />   Complaints?  Well, a few.  The leftish political correctness can turn cartoonish (Prison Song is pure tract -- more in the heavy-handed realm of Rage Against the Machine; the spoken statistics are about as sophomoric as it gets).  Some of the songs, like Jet Fighter, are little more than shouted slogans, and some of the lyrics could use help.  The (still great) power of Toxicity is undermined by the nonsense refrain &quot;eating seeds as a past time activity&quot; (or maybe the allusion is just too subtle for my ozone clouded brain).  <br />    On the other hand, recasting the Christ myth as a &quot;self-righteous suicide&quot; is brilliant -- so far beyond anything else since, oh maybe 60's Bob Dylan, that most listeners probably don't what to make of it.  Now if only someone could explain the part about leaving the keys out on the table.
0671799320|5.0|In a word, superb.  Perhaps I am biased, being a history buff in general, and in the oil industry myself.  But even those not in the industry are still surrounded by, and perhaps feel somewhat controlled or manipulated by, big oil.  So how did this industry evolve into the world's largest, with supernational corporations wielding more economic power than most governments?  Yergin tells this fascinating story in a most readable style.
0446525537|2.0|I am surprised at how many people gave this book such good ratings. I found the story to be boring, trite and predictable. The girl in the story really is too good to be true. Christian or no, just not someone most people can relate to. As for the boy's character, I have to say, I enjoyed his character development although his change of heart happens a little too quickly and with little explanation as to why. <br />The ending of the story was so predictable it's really insulting to the reader's intelligence. Check it out from the library if you want an exceedingly unchallenging, \\"brain-candy\\" type of read. I wouldn't buy it and definitely wouldn't see Hollywood's version either.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Elephant Man was nominated for 8 Academy Awards in 1980. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Original Score, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction-Set Direction, Best Film Editing, and Best Screenplay. Unfortunately, it won none. Best Director was handed to Robert Redford for Ordinary People. I was bewildered why the Academy Awards gave it to him. Ordinary People also won Best Picture. The Elephant Man was also a better movie than Ordinary People. Ordinary People was a great movie, but The Elephant Man and Raging bull was excellent movies. Best Actor in a Leading Role was handed to the deserving Robert De Niro for Raging Bull. John Hurt gave a touching performance as the elephant man, but the audience and the critics could not see his face. That was probably why he only received an Academy Award nomination. However, Hurt won a British Academy Award for his performance. <BR>         The direction and the editing increased the movie artistic quality. The cinematography and strange music gained the haunting and dark atmosphere of the movie. Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt gave a great performance. Anthony Hopkins portrayed Dr. Frederick Treves. Treves was the kind surgeon who helped John Merrick.  John Hurt portrayed John Merrick. John Merrick was a person suffering from proteus syndrome.  The Elephant Man is a story about the triumph of man against society. This movie is recommended to people of all ages.
B000001BZT|5.0|What is it?  Is it country?  Is it southern rock?  What is that banjo doing in there?  Is this guy an Irishman?  Steve Earle continually confounds and tests his audience with his polymathic tastes and talents.  Listen to the bagpipe drone that introduces the title tune, &quot;Copperhead Road,&quot; which ends with the same bagpipes but in between, employs propulsive drumming and hard-charging guitar.  &quot;Snake Oil,&quot; the very next track, sounds almost precisely like something Lynrd Skynrd might have recorded in the 1970s.  &quot;Johnny Come Lately&quot; sounds musically as though it might have sprung from the hand of a Civil War-era Irish immigrant, yet it manages to be fresh today.  Remarkably, all the songs on the album--as on every Steve Earle album--were authored by Earle himself.  The guy is amazing.
B00005J6UP|5.0|One of my favs. it's an 80's teen movie and I love it. About a group of misfits on an adventure of a life time. The movie is funny and full of suspence. If You don't like this movie you are really trully crazy and in denile! The Goonies I give 5 STARS!<BR>~Hey You Guys!!~
055321263X|4.0|Whirling through a plot that somehow combines a ghost story, a romance, and dollops of strong social satire, Collins creates a worthy successor to his classic &quot;The Moonstone.&quot;  The book is lo-o-ong, as are many of his works, but it's worth it.  This is what probably 90% of the romance and mystery novels published today yearn to be, and what makes them pale in comparison.
0451457994|4.0|2001 is one of only a few science fiction novels that I've read and I enjoyed it tremendously. Clarke is clearly a distinguished writer and provides every 'part' of the book with a particular feel. This style provides an interesting contrast to Kubrick's movie version. Whereas scenes from the movie seem slow moving and almost static, the book flows smoothly. Though essentially the same story, both end up leaving you with an entirely different feeling. As a result, both are definitely worth the time.
B000001ESN|3.0|Big Rush fans and even casual ones will probably lynch me for this review. But I just didn't like some of the material. Only ones that are incredible are Nat. Sci. and Freewill. Sorry, but SoR is just played out. Not a terrible album, but not into it anymore.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I've always appreciated films that take some risks...Memento, Being John Malkovich, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, to name a few. I am also a fan of musicals. But after listening to many glowing reviews and recommendations, I watched Moulin Rouge and was baffled.<br />For the first 30 minutes I was just flat out confused as to what the director was \\"going for.\\" Then about 30 minutes into it, I thought it was supposed to be a satire. But after 45 minutes or so, the whole idea of this film began to wear a little thin. The whole \\"Hey, we've moderized some old songs and turned some modern ones into show tunes\\" really began to grate on my nerves. The renditions of \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" were especially...well, stupid.<br />I'll give them an \\"A\\" for creativity, but avoid this one if you can.
B000001FS3|5.0|Stop with all the nonsense about &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; being U2's best album. Achtung Baby is a tremendous record, probably their second best, but this is in spite of, and not because of, the fact that it is a U2 album. In Achtung Baby the group was looking to transform its music from the soaring guitar tracks of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; to a more dance-based style more &quot;appropriate&quot; to the 90's. The thing is, it worked; Achtung Baby is strong from start to finish. It moves, it grooves, and it even has a couple pretty tracks like &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.&quot; But this, as great as it is, is not what U2 does best. I like Achtung Baby a lot, but where is Edge's huge, faraway guitar and Adam's brooding base?<br />The first three songs on The Joshua Tree are three of the greatest songs of all time. Imagine any memory, any place that you love, and these songs will take you there. That they are placed one right after the other-and right at the start of the album-makes them even more effective. The rest of the album is almost irrelavent after the opening trio. It's just a bonus that the rest of the album is strong as well. One could seemingly make the argument that the last eight songs off of The Joshua Tree pale in comparison to the consistency of Achtung Baby, but the rest of The Joshua Tree in truth is as strong as Achtung Baby. It's just that those eight seem a little weak after &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name,&quot; &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,&quot; and &quot;With or Without You.&quot; In fact, &quot;Running to Stand Still,&quot; &quot;In God's Country,&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; would be centerpieces of almost any other U2 record.<br />Achtung Baby is a cool album, but &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; don't stack up to the first three off The Joshua Tree, and the groovy rhythms and riffs of &quot;Zoo Station,&quot; &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing,&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot; are not enough for Achtung Baby to compare to what just might be the greatest rock album of all time. The Joshua Tree is adrenaline-pumping and beautiful all at once. It is simply a must-have for any fan of rock music; it is certainly the centerpiece of any U2 collection.
B00003CXE7|1.0|What a snooze-fest. Terribly over-rated. There's so much talk, talk, so many long, long shots of facial expressions that you want to scream: okay, let's have some action! Even the action sequences are akwardly handled. Russell crowe is terrif but Ridley Scott could have borrowed some of the fun from the Steve Reeves muscle epics. This flick takes forever to get started. 'Scuse me while I watch &quot;Hercules&quot; starring the incomparable--and vastly more watchable Steve Reeves.
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is a very fine movie in its own right. I know comparisons are made to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, however this movie portrays the realism of Vietnam, where the others show the horrors of Somalia and World War 2. The comparison should stop there. Having served in Vietnam some 5 years after the conclusion of this battle...I have some recollections as to how these things came down. It was very hard for me to sit through this movie...the realism is very good and the acting fine. I had a small problem with Mel Gibson as Colonel Moore, sounding a bit \\"John Wayneish\\", almost like he patterned himself after Mr. Wayne, but aside from that he still gave a good performance.  Sam Elliot's performance as the unit's Sergeant Major is the highlight of the movie and although some of it is lighthearted in the early part of the movie, his character is totally believable. I would hope that those who wanted to know more about Vietnam would see this movie, and I would hope that those who are afraid it would bring back memories would see it too, we need not forget these men whom so bravely gave their lives for our country, as they have in all wars and as they do now, and I would hope that in the last few moments of the movie , when they show the casualties from this battle and the fact that there were 58,000 more, that each viewer would take a little more pride in who we are as Americans and as patriots, and what that means.
0140149295|5.0|I'm not an avid reader of books.  I think that in my life I've read about 6 books from start to finish.  This book is one of them.  His life is an amazing/tragic yet inspiring one.  The feeling I got after reading this book is that it teaches alot about the human sprit and what it can accomplish when you set your mind to it.<br />His writing style pulls no stops, He's direct and to the point.  <br />The writing style he adopts gives you a real look at the Rubin Carter, in a way the Movie or other books about him can't.<br />Want to Know the real Rubin Carter! - Read this book
B000002JK2|5.0|Also, the unfulfilled promise of the solo Ronnie Lane. Heart to Hang Onto remains a treasured memory. Their version ot 'Til the Rivers All Run Dry is still easily the best song Eric Clapton has ever been involved with. The album even transcend the vulgar silliness of My Baby Gives it Away.
B00005Y228|2.0|I am one of the few diehard U.S. fans of Kylie who bought and loved her two Geffen records; both are upbeat pop music at its finest, with lyrics of some depth.  I was really looking forward to this new record, but am very disappointed.  I knew to expect a dance record, rather than pop, but lyrically, these songs are weak, and the melodies and dance beats of many of the songs are indistinguishable.  The first single is great, but it is definitely the album's only high point.
B00005QIPH|2.0|This is a great example of style over substance.  The Strokes can pose, sneer and act snotty.  They have hip clothes and great rock-n-roll hair.  The have a sack full of great reviews.  The one thing missing is.....TALENT.  They just can't play.  Their songs aren't particularly interesting in structure, theme or melody. Their chops are terrible.  Yet, some influential music spin-doctor has labled this &quot;minimalist&quot; in an attempt to justify their lack of proficiency in playing and songwriting.   The only reason they SEEM interesting is the background of boy-band garbage and bubble-gum pop against which they are juxtaposed. As a guitar player for the last 20 years, I love all types of guitar driven music-rock, pop, metal, punk, jazz- whatever.  For me, however, the Strokes come up lacking.
B00005U122|5.0|I will state my case right away:  This is not going to be a bad review, in fact, this DVD is the best recording I have spent money on in the last 20 years.<BR>Let me say straight away, I am not a sycophant.  I like PF, I saw them several times in the 70's.  I don't own all their records, I don't possess any PF/Waters T shirts etc and I am not in their fan club. I recently bought the ITF CD however and was blown away.  This CD made me realise that I had grown old! I had lost interest in music, destroyed by the pap I have been listening to for the last 20 years.  At the risk of sounding like a complete prat, this CD made me feel young again.  For the first time in years, I was actually excited by the music I was hearing.  To use a cliche, the music actually moved me.<BR>Because England is a third world country however, the DVD isn't available over here.  However, the miracle that is the internet allowed me to buy a region 1 copy, which, naively, I thought I would be able to play using an 'adaptor' for my Playstation. <BR>I soon discovered that a NTSC compatible TV was also required.  <BR>350 later that same day I had my NICAM, NTSC compatible TV and a big dent in my credit card.  Let me say right now that it was worth every penny! I have never been so gobsmacked by a recording of a live concert.  Watching it gave me the sort of buzz absent from my life for the last 20 years.  Not 'cos I am a sad git that doesn't get out, but because Roger and his band manage to create such a magic atmosphere and demonstrate the sort of musical perfection that I can only remember from my teen years of seeing live concerts of the likes of YES, Genesis, Zeppelin, Eagles etc.<BR>This DVD has genuinely rekindled an enthusiasm for music in me that I thought I had lost.  Watching these musicians in action is a sheer joy. I'll try not to bore you with the details but the playing of Doyle Bramhall II is truly inspirational.  If you have never watched this man play guitar you have never lived!And believe me, you do have to watch him, his style is unique to say the least. (I have bought his entire back catalogue as a result of seeing him on this DVD, and I had never even heard of him before!).  The guitar playing of Doyle is beautifully complimented by the sheer genius of Snowy White, whose (relatively) restrained style of playing provides a perfect counterpoint for Doyle's more elaborate style.  Andy Low is a genius, the singers can actually sing, the drummer could give 'animal' a run for his money and everyone else is also absolutely perfect.<BR>What makes this particular product different from the rest however, is Water's influence.  This guy wrote the lyrics to begin with.  Roger is the engine that powered PF for years.<BR>I may be wrong, but Roger strikes me as the kind of man that writes with a VISION.  He knows how the music he writes should sound.  He knows EXACTLY how the music he writes should sound.  This vision must be hard to translate in a band where everyone else has a musical opinion, and this may be why PF went their own ways.  In this product however, Roger gets his way.  This is how the music was meant to be heard.  Roger has assembled a band of exceedingly rare talent but, they are in this case, HIS band.<BR>The music is played as Roger intended and boy, does it show.<BR>This is the first record (I'll call it a record but the visuals are essential)for years that not only produced a lump in my throat, but had tears streaming down my cheeks.  \\"She stood upon Southampton Dock...\\".<BR>If you can watch this DVD and not be seriously moved, you are not from the same planet as I am.  Which is fairy snuff, but if you are reading this review and have got this far, you are almost certainly from the same planet as I am.
B00004T1NA|5.0|If you've been following Porcupine Tree up to this point, you might think they've been getting more and more commercial. I would instead suggest that songwriter Steven Wilson was just becoming more conscious of conventional songwriting while maintaining his ambition to explore unconventional musical vistas. These days, the band is sounding like a harder-rocking Pink Floyd with fat analogs and tense, slow-paced jams, and I really enjoy it all. Lightbulb Sun is less rockin' than the previous album, Stupid Dream, leaning towards a 'poppier' quality. If there were ever doubts that Steven Wilson is an amazing songwriter, this album will lay them to rest. &quot;Shesmovedon&quot; and &quot;The Rest Will Flow&quot; are some of the best pop/rock songs you'll hear these days. Wilson's vocal harmonies are excellent. Many of the songs rely heavily on the acoustic guitar, which captures the subtle folk influence which is prevalent in Wilson's writing. The band flirted with Indian influences on Stupid Dream (the song &quot;Tinto Brass&quot;) and they do so again here on &quot;4 Chords That Made a Million&quot;, where the exotic percussion is very amusing. &quot;Last Chance to Evacuate Planet Earth Before It Is Recycled&quot; is oddly hysterical, with the second half of the track featuring samples from the Heaven Gate's cult's message before they committed mass suicide. &quot;Russia on Ice&quot; is the tripped-out epic, with melancholic vocals and string arrangements for the first half and a lengthy, intricate jam for the rest. Finishing the album is the sad, minimalist ballad &quot;Feel So Low.&quot; Like all of Porcupine Tree's music, you can't go wrong with this album.
B000002N1E|5.0|why is this not avalbale in the stores it rocks.  Especially P control what a song to get down to.  I wish more people would make it avalbale i have freinds who like the album but can't get hold of it.
B000002H97|1.0|This was my first metallica album I bought and I thought it was good until I started buying their other ones like Kill e'm all,Ride the lighting,Master of puppets(all time favorite) and ...And Justice for All(stick with this ones) and then I realized this cd stinks]! the change was way to much from thrash/metal to just plain radio rock, I can't belive some people think this is their best...Well this is nothing compare to what came after like Load and Reload...
B00002JV0I|5.0|Speaking specifically of Norway, there are so many classic and vital Black Metal acts that dominated the field throughout the 90's - Dark Throne, Emperor, Satyricon, Mayhem, and of course Immortal.  There's no denying that Immortal has been around practically since the beginning of Black Metal's cold-hearted Scandinavian reign, and despite being a source of endless debate over their lyrics, they've remained uncompromising and unwavering on their wintry path to domination.<BR>But more important than all that is how Immortal transformed themselves into more of a profound Black Metal force than they ever were - especially with the release of \\"At The Heart Of Winter\\", and strangely doing so with musical elements that were not typically associated with Norwegian Black Metal.  As it seems, just prior to the new millennium, many of the genre's high profile acts were looking for outside inspiration to inject new life into what they were considering a stale environment.  Most fans discovered that Satyricon, Emperor, Mayhem, Tormentor, and a few others added surprising elements to their trademark formulas - some with good results, and others... well... ahem.  But, when the almighty Immortal found themselves progressing, it was simply brilliant.<BR>First off, to ease disciples of true Black Metal, Immortal's core sound is still here.  The discordant minor-key guitars are still emanating pure evil and still give the listener mental images of northern mountains, icy fjords, haunted forests, and heathen ruins.  But carefully intertwined within most of the tracks are riffs that, if it would not be for the tremendous pace of Horgh's drums, would be considered extremely creative Heavy Metal masterworks. There are even excerpts of lush and melodic guitar flourishes that go even further to transport the listener to the majestic icy northland, especially in \\"Withstand The Fall Of Time\\" and \\"Solarfall\\", where Iscariah's bass takes flight from the riffs to create melodically haunting andintense dynamics.  The only thing that the hardcore Black Metal fiend will likely disprove of is the slower pace of some of the tracks, although on these occasions it works wonders to accentuate the mysterious atmosphere they've created.  Despite how far Immortal took their sound on this album, their music and image still has \\"a special, individual identity and feeling\\" as they have said themselves.  No matter where they've taken their sound, their main inspirations of Bathory, Possessed and Celtic Frost are still eminent as their lifeblood.<BR>Another breath-taking aspect of the album is the amazing cover.  The band was given a budget to commission a painting for the album, which was a twist because Immortal are notorious for posing on their covers themselves.  The final product came out beautifully and was the perfect imagery to complement Immortal's music.<BR>Much has been inferred concerning this album's direction since it was Immortal's first without Demonaz.  Much of those criticisms are unfounded, as Abbath has made it clear that Demonaz is still very much a member of Immortal, albeit a \\"ghost member\\" due to his diminished role (he still contributes lyrics and serves guidance and direction since he can no longer play guitar).  And even though Immortal took such a drastic turn with \\"At The Heart Of Winter\\" they immediately began infusing more of their older sound back into the mix on \\"Damned In Black\\" and beyond.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I, too, cannot believe that this wonderful performer didn't win a single Grammy. It would seem that the Grammy awards have become like the Academy Awards, not necessarily based on individual merit but on politics. Here's a young woman with boundless talent: a wonderfully sultry voice, great songwriting skill, and the ability to play a number of instruments. Her guitar-playing on this album is simple but entirely appropriate. Worth noting is that one doesn't have to strain to make out the lyrics; she actually enunciates without detracting one bit from the content. This is a wonderful album, filled with personal comments, beliefs, and observations. With hints of Caribbean rhythm, this is contemporary yet timeless music. With any luck, India.Arie will be with us for many years to come. Never strident or grating, always mellow, this is fine music.<BR>Most highly recommended.
B000009EAD|5.0|Once more, Iced Earth proved that they were beyond comparison in the realm of Heavy Metal with \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\".  By 1998, when this album was released, Metal was on its way to becoming so revered again in the underground that it would soon be bubbling over into a very popular phenomenon.  The advantage Iced Earth had was that they had been doing this for the entire decade, not just when it was getting \\"big\\" again.  They were simply doing what they did best.  After the great \\"Burnt Offerings\\" and the phenomenal \\"Dark Saga\\" albums, \\"Something Wicked...\\" was yet another triumph in the lineage of a Metal band that was doing absolutely no wrong.<BR>Ever maturing, evolving, and expanding, Iced Earth created another thirteen songs here that would rival the intensity of anything in their back catalog.  Lots of Thrash-heavy riffs, loads of dark and melodic interludes to add mystery and drama to the mix, and plenty of brutal, dark Metal to appease any fan of the genre.  Matthew Barlow, now definitely an undeniable fixture of the band, put just as much effort into the vocal delivery.  Even the drum position was filled by a returning member, if only as a guest musician.  This was finally the sound of a true band reaping the rewards of dedication and determination over the long haul.  Despite the increased number of European bands now playing this type of Metal, no one was even close to matching the brilliance and intensity of Iced Earth.  Fans definitely knew that this was the read deal, especially at this point.  In fact, the band never lost sight of who had gotten them to this point, hence the \\"Blessed Are You\\" tribute to the true fans who had gotten Iced Earth to this point.<BR>One of the strong points on the album is definitely its lyrical outlook.  All Iced Earth albums contain decent lyrics, but it feels like this one was filled with more inspired topics and pinpoint lyrical accuracy.  Of course, that would lead to songs that infer more conviction.  Withsongs like \\"Stand Alone\\", \\"My Own Savior\\", and \\"Consequences\\", it's obvious that Schaffer and Barlow are really comfortable now with using their artistic powers to spread universal truths of belief in ones self, independence, and integrity.  With the vicious, brutal nature of the music behind \\"Disciples Of The Lie\\", it's only appropriate and ntural for the lyrics to be as biting and scathing as they are - a perfect match.  The album's most honest, introspective, and dramatic track is undoubtedly \\"Watching Over Me\\", Schaffer's tribute to a life-long friend of his who passed away - the same friend, in fact, that came up with the band's name and to whom the \\"Enter The Realm\\" demo was dedicated.  <BR>While this album is a non-concept affair, the title refers to the trilogy of tracks that end the disk.  The \\"Something Wicked...\\" triad marks an introduction to a full concept album that would eventually take place later in the band's career.  These songs encapsulate the prophecy, birth, and development of the character that will manifest itself in the eventual album.  The final song is the character's introduction - a dramatic entrance for what is to come.  The actual concept for this centers around a secret society that has been in existence for 12,000 years plotting the destruction of mankind.  Judging from various interviews, the actual plot and theme looks to be absolutely brilliant.  Amazingly, the three songs that introduce this plot and theme leave just enough to the imagination to make it unquestionably mysterious and engaging.<BR>In retrospect, it's difficult to decide whether this album's notoriety was gained on its own right or for the full-length concept album it would eventually bring forth.  It may be true that the final three songs are the reason for this album's success (especially with the epic \\"The Coming Curse\\" finale).  But no matter what, this entire album is a fine chapter in the life of the only American Heavy Metal band throughout the 90's that mattered.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|...and from Prince, we expect much more.<BR>I mean we don't want fillers, like some of the songs on this album.<BR>This album is quite different what he had done before, but still enjoyable, but not 4 the first listen.<BR>Listen to it more times and then you will have some favs from TRC. I have:<br />Rainbow Children: the part in the middle with that funky guitar-riffs reminds me of Controversy. Jazzy, funky fusion. Great.<br />The Sensual Everafter: instrumental one, very Oldfieldish guitar and melody.<br />The Everlasting Now: the funkiest track on the album, one of his best funk songs from the past years! There is a part where he plays like Santana.<br />The Last December: great ending 2 a good album. May be the most remarkable song on the CD, if U liked Gold then U must hear it.<br />There is the J. Brownish Work Pt.1. that is still good.<BR>Mellow and She Loves Me 4 Me R well done tracks too, but not his best. The others R terrible fillers, I just cannot get used to them. Try it. May be you will.<br />All in all: a good album. Not great, just good, but better than Rave Un2. If U prefer The Vault... 2 Rave Un2 then it is your album 2 buy. If your favourite Prince-albums R Rave Un2 and Batman, then stay away from TRC.<BR>It's your decision!
6304712936|5.0|I'm a Mozart freak. One of the things the DVD includes is the track from the movie -- just the soundtrack, no movie. I think that is totally cool. Of course, I do own the soundtrack already, so that's more of a goodie than a must-have to me. But still, a cool goodie.<br />The movie's good too, with a crisp, clear picture. The version I saw was widescreen -- my preference, personally. For those who have not seen the movie, it is based on the life of Mozart and his rivalry with the older, more staid Salieri (whose music you can still find). Costumes and sets are lush and evocative, the acting is divine, and the direction is incredible. This movie won a lot of awards back in its day, and for good reason. And in a cameo that just begs to be recognized, it has Vincent Schiavelli as a valet who thinks he knows how to get Salieri's attention in the first scene (he was the disgusting biology teacher in \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\", and has had a host of other neat little roles).<br />Between the exquisite quality of picture and the extras it includes, this is definitely a DVD I appreciate having.
B00005Y228|5.0|When I first heard CGYOOMH, I instantly loved it.  For me the surprise is that it's playing on US radio.  Bought the album, love every song, which is rare.  While Madonna delivers product with more depth, the only albums she has that I like this consistently are greatest hits sets.  \\"Fever\\" may have less lyrical substance (though it has enough for me), but stylistically, it is one absolutely fabulous ensemble.  I'll still be surprised if any other singles make it in the states.  The general taste here is...different (although the club scene is sure to wear this set out).  I just know that I'll be listening to this one for quite some time.
B00005U11Z|5.0|NO DVD CONCERT ON THE MARKET TODAY COMES CLOSE TO MATCHING THE ENERGY AND SOUND OF THIS GREAT R&amp;R BAND.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SIT STILL THROUGHOUT THIS CONCERT.

0441172717|3.0|Every time I read 'Dune' I marvel at the universe Frank Herbert has invented.  The book's setting is dense, confusing, intriguing, and belies a strange understanding of the human conciousness.  The problem is, Herbert rushes over his descriptions of setting to put us in some boring desert.  I always end up wondering about Caladan and Ix and the Bene Gesseret the Imperium and all those other details.  Not surprisingly, my favorite parts of the book were the glossary and essay on religion.<br />For most of the book I never really liked Paul or Jessica or the Fremen or any other character.  I was interested in Paul's metamorphosis into a super-being, but I think that Herbert understandably has trouble explaining the shift into hyper-conciousness.  And the way Herbert writes in general seems a bit undisciplined, a lack of polish and refinement if you will.<br />The 'Dune' universe is brilliant, but it probably made a hell of lot more sense inside Herbert's head.  <br />Despite all my complaints, it's probably my favorite sci-fi book.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is the most amazing CD I have ever heard. Nothing comes close to Linkin Park. Everything about them is good. The beats are amazing, the lyrics are powerful, and the vocals are great. There isn't one song on the CD that [is bad]. They are all great songs. Here's what I think of each song...<br />01: Papercut (8/10)-Very good intro song. This song is on the heavier side. I like when the melodic singing and the heavy singing are put together at the end.<br />02: One Step Closer (10/10) One of my favorite songs. Probably the heaviest and loudest on the CD. No rapping in this song but it doesn't need it. Just pure hard-hitting metal.<br />03: With You (7/10) Not my favorite, but I still like it. I like the chorus a lot but the verses aren't as exciting as Linkin Park can get.<br />04: Points of Authority (8/10) Like the last one, I love the chorus but the verses weren't that great. The background guitaring is good though throughout the chorus. Only a bit of rapping. Chester's voice can get pretty high in this one.<br />05: Crawling (10/10) Powerful song. The first LP song I heard and definately one of the best. Both the chorus and verses are great in this song. I never get tired of listening to it.<br />06: Runaway (7/10) When I first heard this one, I thought it was an amazing song. But after a while it started to lose it's punch. Still a great song. One of the songs with the most singing in it.<br />07: By Myself (8/10) I like the backround beat and the chorus. Once again the verses could be better but the great chorus is worth waiting for.<br />08: In The End (10/10) My all-time favorite! I love this song because they mixed a bunch of different styles together. They play a melodic song in the backround while Shinoda emcees. Then they mix that same melodic song with a fairly heavy metal chorus by Chester.<br />09: A Place for My Head (9/10) Mostly made up of Shinoda's emceeing, which is really good in this song. Everything in this song is great and evenly balanced. I like the part with Chester singing (or yelling) 'You try to take the best of me, go away!'.<br />10: Forgotten (9/10) It sounds like there are two choruses in this one. Not really but I like the part 'In the memory you'll find me...' better than the chorus. I find it more powerful than the chorus.<br />11: Cure for the Itch (8/10) This is an instrumental track done by Mr. Hahn. I like to relax to this song. Just something on the lighter side.<br />12: Pushing Me Away (7/10) This song is also on the lighter side, since it's more of Chester's singing than his screaming. Probably not the best song for a finale, but still a good song.
B00003CXXP|5.0|i've already written a review of the film.. this one is for the dvd.. i got it today, and watched it.. my 3rd time seeing the film.  the strange thing is that while i definately noticed more of the flaws in the structure and script of the film, i cared even less that there even were flaws.  steven spielberg went balls-out on this one and he deserves some recognition and respect for making such a brave and moving film, despite whatever shortcomings there might be.  <br />One final thought on the ending:  a lot of people say this is the part that makes the movie suffer the most, but in my mind, and especially after seeing it again, without this ending the whole film is for naught.  that ending is what the whole film was leading up to.. love it or hate it. think about the things gigolo joe says in Rouge City.. \\"those who created us are constantly looking for those who created them.\\"   and later:  \\"humans hate us because they know that when it all ends, the only ones left will be us\\"<br />if you're one of those that saw this movie once and didn't like it, i reccommend at least renting it, and giving it another shot.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was sooo ready to hate this movie: I can't stand most musicals in general (don't understand the fun of interrupting dialogue to break into mediocre song). Then I heard that Kidman and McGregor sang for their own parts and that Leguziamo was playing artist Toulouse-Lautrec...I thought, this stinks! But then I ended up renting it out of curiosity. I heard it was a kind of retelling of Dumas' Dame aux Camelias (but the courtesan goes for the pauper, not the aristocrat). <BR>And I loved it. It's such a great movie for so many reasons. First of all, the visuals are incredible. The movie has a story book quality to it. Some of the scenes are pure metaphor (I love the shot of Paris at night- quiet and moonlit, except for the red glare and cheer coming from the wild Moulin Rouge). The use of music is very clever! Some people here mentioned they would have liked something more authentic. Now, an authentic depiction of the Moulin Rouge already exists- if you watch the extra feautures, you'll see what the scene was like. You can understand and logically make out that at those times, to be in such a place, dancing like that, glimpsing the underwear of unattached and very available ladies was a titilating experience. But you'll be watching with an air of nostalgic comprehension. We see far spicier on any sitcom nowadays. However, in this version, the music is contemporary. It has  bass, it has beat- it's loud, it's wild (the looks on people's faces make you think of how right on Toulouse-Lautrec's posters were). By having this contemporary music playing, music that is dancing music, music that you would recognize at a nightclub, you are having a visceral reaction to the whole scene. Suddenly you feel why this place was so decadent, why it was so wild. <BR>There is only one original composition in the film, but the songs you'll recognize here have all received a special treatment, and are old and new at the same time (Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friends is successfully mixed with Material Girl, for instance). It also makes you think about the power and familiarity of love songs- whether in 1900 or 2002, the desire, longing, and love are the same.<BR>I thought Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sang decently. Toulouse-Lautrec would have loved his trickster-like portrayal, because he was, after all, a decadent lover of the Paris cabaret, bohemian and artistic crowd. <BR>The references to absynthe were chilling and seductive at once- like a hellish muse. And ultimately the story is about a muse who loves and is loved by an artist- whether she is hellish or divine is something you must view (and decide) for yourself...<BR>If you can deal with your initial shock and discomfort (it is very unique, and because of its unfamiliarity, at first it feels strange)you might enjoy this clever movie.
0345440757|4.0|This book is fun and easy to read.  I found using the advice and tips helpful.  My daughter who is now 7 months started sleeping through the night at 3 months. She also is a great eater and plays by herself for 30 minutes at a time.  It's fairly easy to get things done around the house and plan for trips because of the schedule she has.  The book is very helpful in teaching the different cues babies use to tell you something.  My only prblem with it was I don't think it can truelly be utilized until the baby is 3 months old. The schedule suggested just doesn't fit with a newborn.  And in the beginning, all the cries sound the same. I got very frustrated doing everything the book said to do but nothing worked until she become 3 months old.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Don't listen to those few critics who broadsided(small clue to Russell's next movie) this beautiful movie...complaining that some ruff stuff about Dr. Nash's life was left out.  The film is stunning ... and it has the BEST PERFORMANCE by An Actor that this movie goer has ever seen and I've seen them all (since 1952) including all of this year's Oscar nominations.   <br />Crowe doesn't just play it, he disappears in it and you are privileged to meet the brilliant, intense, disturbed, compelling young, middle aged and elder beautiful mind that reflects the genius and torment of Dr. John Nash.    Yes,  it is entertainment folks...mesmerizing, edifying, intense and finally it bings your heart home.<br />But, it also says something important about mental illness.    Many of the homeless people you meet suffer from mental illness including schizophrenia.  They have no one to take care of them, they forget to take their meds, they act crazy, they scare you? Next time try seeing them as a Nobel Laureate.
B000002UAX|2.0|Come on, guys.  I thought you were above that.  You're supposed to be the greatest band in the world.  Why must you record 30 songs and only about 10 actually have substance?  I would have expected better.<BR>First of all, I don't want to pay 30 dollars for two discs when I could just burn the several good songs off the Internet.  Those good songs are incredible, definetely Beatle material, but what's with songs like Wild Honey Pie that scare me more than entertain.  <BR>Cut the dead weight: make one crisp CD and it might be one of their best.
B00005OAIE|5.0|All hail one of the next great singer/songwriters. John Mayer's Room For Squares is a revelation. On his major-label debut, Mayer writes songs for a lazy-day afternoon that on the surface sound like pure pop, but after inspection of the lyrics prove to be much, much more. Room For Squares is driven by Mayer's lyrics. The instrumentation is nothing special, but it's the words and craftsmanship of the songs that make an impact. With a voice reminiscent of Dave Matthews and David Gray, \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" is a catchy, clever song about saying the wrong thing to a date with Mayer swearing that, \\"I'm never speaking up again, starting now,\\" with the song seemingly ending, only for Mayer to decide that there's \\"One more thing...\\" It has single written all over it. \\"Why Georgia\\" is a powerful questioning of life where Mayer sings, \\"I wonder sometimes/ About the outcome/ Of a still verdictless life/ Am I living it right?\\" \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" is a love song that puts the \\"love\\" back in the genre. Instead of singing simply about sex, Mayer is singing about the joy that comes with discovering and being with the one you're meant to be with. \\"City Love\\" is perhaps a companion piece to \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland.\\" Mayer writes about how love changes your perspective on life and how the right person can make life worthwhile. Not everything is upbeat, however. \\"Neon\\" questions what it's like to attempt to hold on to someone that you know you shouldn't be with, and \\"83\\" laments the loss of adolescent innocence that comes with growing up. The album's standout, \\"Not Myself,\\" combines both joyous and sad elements in a song that is ostensibly about depression and what it feels like to say to someone, \\"Suppose I said, you're my saving grace... My grace... My grace... When I'm someone else.\\"  I defy anyone who has ever gone through any kind of depression to not be touched deeply by this song. After the triumph that is Room For Squares, John Mayer has joined the pantheon of rock's truly gifted songwriters.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles were, in my eyes, overrated until Revolver, when they stopped touring and took more times to write songs that had more to do with life than cheesy love songs even NSYNC would look dopey singing.  Abbey Road is the icing on the cake: the absolute best Beatles album, maybe the best album of all time.  <BR>Abbey Road allows every Beatle to contribute a song, though I would prefer if Ringo just gave up on his singing, and created a unique blend seen in few other Beatle albums.  In the first half of Abbey Road, there are classics like Come Together and Something.  But the second half is incredible: arranging an excellent array of songs that mold into each other, concluding with my favorite Beatles song: The End.  <BR>It was a good way for the Beatles to end it, to say the least.
630170648X|5.0|Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 version of \\"TO BE OR NOT TO BE\\", is the #1 BLACK COMEDY classic of all-time.  Selected by the American Film Institute (AFI) in 2000 as one of the greatest films in the \\"TOP 100 Years, 100 Laughs\\" category. (Carole Lombard was also selected as one of the Top 25 Hollywood Female Legends. (AFI's 100 Years 100 Stars (1999)).<br />NOTE: Black or Dark Comedy - are movies that can make us laugh but also instill an uneasy feeling.  The laughter comes from subject matter that is offbeat & perhaps a little macabre.<br />Summary:  Director Ernst Lubitsch's Black Comedy is about a Polish troupe of actors headed by Joseph Tura (Jack Benny - hysterical (best known for radio & television)) & his wife Maria (Carole Lombard - talented & beautiful (this was her final picture. She died in an airplane crash 3 weeks after film completion.  Returning home to her husband Clark Gable from a very successful \\"War Bond\\" drive.).  They find their work & lives interrupted because of Nazi occupation during WWII.  To protect the Polish underground the actors become involved in various schemes requiring them to impersonate Nazi Officials & soldiers confusing their operations.  This creates a satirical (Dark Comedy) situation.  The actors are able to expose a dangerous double agent, foil the Nazis & escape the country safely.<br />A genius Director, fabulous cast \\"TO BE OR NOT TO BE (1942)\\" remains as one of the great films filled with; propaganda, farces, spies, thrills, melodrama, tragedy, even vaudeville wrapped all in one unforgetable package!!!!<br />This VHS Video, 99 minutes in length, no extras, presented in Black & White, Full Screen format w/hi-fi sound.  Excellent quality picture & sound.<br />This is a timeless Black Comedy that everyone can enjoy & experience the war years of Hollywood & its invaluable contribution.  \\"To Be Or Not To Be\\" that is the answer!  Enjoy.

B00003CXDD|5.0|From the creator of Star Wars comes Willow which does have some feeling to Star Wars, but is a lot more fun and appealing. The story starts off with the birth of an infant who will bring upon the downfall of an evil queen. When the queen learns of this prophecy, the baby is abandoned, and discovered by young Willow Ufgood(Warwick Davis), a farmer who is an inspiring sorcereer. With time running out, Willow must soon embark on a quest to protect the child from the queen. With the aid of a great swordsman(Val Kilmer), Willow races against time in this very appealing adventure for all ages. Granted the story does have some feeling of a J.R.R. Tolkien novel, but the charm and appeal it has could be told none other than from George Lucas who is both a story-teller, and a old-fashioned movie buff! The movie also has the greatist James Horner(Titanic) musical score of all. A must for all fantasy or action buffs.
B00005HXP9|5.0|Excellent album.  Classic Scorps tunes and some covers--all performed live and acoustically.  This is one of the best acoustic albums I have heard.  The sound is rich, vibrant and crystal clear.  Klaus' vocals are superb--I don't think he's sounded better.  Do yourself a favor and get the Japanese edition.  The others do no not include &quot;Rhythm of Love,&quot; which is a shame as it's a classic track, acoustic or traditional.  It's well worth it!
B000002HMH|3.0|As has been stated several times before, this album and the subsequent Re-Load fell flat of previous Metallica releases because the band strayed to far from their musical base.<BR>Most of the songs feature to many acustic guitars, not enough bass,close to no catchy guitar riffs, and above all else THEY'RE TOO SLOW! When I buy a Metallica, I want to hear thrash/speed metal! The lyrics have no meaning, the are just exactly what they are (a complete 180 from Master of Puppets). <BR>Not all of this album was a complete waste, Until It Sleeps and Hero of the Day can trace their roots to earlier matierial.
B000056NX5|5.0|I had watched the 70s film version of JCS and was not impressed much, then I had this DVD.  I was captured right from the beginning and couldn't believe how great it is! This production is a piece of theatre caught on screen.  I experienced everything I could have experienced in a real theatre while sitting in the front row: the realness, the dramatics, and the rawness, plus the surround Dolby 5.1, which, however, cannot be experienced from the stage.  This musical itself is the kind of show that no matter where the stage is set, the essence and the musicality will always be there.  However, when it is set in the 90s New York City, the effectiveness of the drama is magically amplified and intensified.  Moreover, the T-shirt garbed, young and vigorous disciples in the hippest hairstyles, and the catchy choreography are simply closer to the young people at our time.<br />Musical is meant for the theatre and stage.  It needs a stage, no matter if it is a real stage or one on screen.  Once the play is set on the stage, everything falls into place. The theatrical acting becomes quite captivating.  I could point out a few weaknesses of the vocal delivery in the show, but they are complemented by the greatness of the acting. <br />\\"He is a man, he's just a man.\\"  While Glen Carter reveals the human nature of Jesus Christ very truthfully (definitely with credit to his look and figure), he couples the outside softness with the inner strength very well and creates the profoundness and extraordinariness of Jesus.  \\"Every word you say today gets twisted round some other way.\\"  The complexity of Judas is more emphasized on his loyalty to his mission, rather than his greediness.  Jerome Pradon, taking on the most challenging part in both acting and singing, is remarkably good.  \\"I don't know how to love him.\\" The soothing and smooth voice of Renee Castle distinguishes herself as the best Mary Magdalene I've ever heard.  Tony Vincent, Wow! Just couldn't be better. The ardency in his singing and acting catches the rebelliousness of Simon Zealotes brilliantly.                  <br />This is the show that once you start watching, you won't be able to pull yourself out. So get yourself a comfortable chair, let music wash you, let emotions drown you, let words and melodies hit, sadden, and inspire you.  This is the magic created by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice, Gale Edwards, the cast, and many others.

B000002KIE|5.0|As a 2nd generation punk &lt;sneer&gt; from the '80s, this album was a staple of what I listened to.  Of course, Malcolm McLaren had the last laugh all the way to the Bank.  It's ok because regardless of the motivation, this album captured the angst and anger of a generation tired of bloated rock bands and stodgy society.  To think that Nirvana gets more recognition than these guys amazes me.  Nirvana are a retread Pistols.
0812550706|5.0|Ok. To start off if I don't like a book I won't read it unless  I'm forced to by a teacher which I then tell them how much I hated it. That's why most of them like me, but anyway...<br />About a month ago my Intro Chem. & Phys. Teacher said she would be reading us one of her favorite books on every thursday. She was going at a pace of one chapter per week, but I liked it (except the kids were a little too teenagerish to be 6 years old) so I checked out the book in the school library when I finally found it on the shelf. I heard someone ask Mrs. Collett about the second book and she was explaining that ender was time traveling so when I got to the part about lightspeed travel I decide what was going to happen but to my supprise it was ending tottally diffirent than I expected. I figured that he would finish traing and go to fight the war, I was somewaht way, way off. Right now I'm in Ch. 15 Speaker For The Dead, and I only have half a chapter to read. Hope you read the book, I loved it you will too.
B00003CXUM|4.0|For those who haven't had the opportunity of comparing the Criterion edition with the 2-disc French edition, they might like to know that the extra contents are a bit different.<br />Ultimately, I believe the French edition wins out in terms of its packaging and the design of the chapters' menu, as well as the high visual resolution.<br />Nevertheless, the graphic designers at Criterion should be commended on their superb design of the booklet &amp; cover. This is top notch design &amp; typography.
B000002J1H|5.0|At this time YES is I guess somewhat out of fashion.  Critics for some unknown reason always seem to exclude them for great album lists and great band lists.  Sometimes I think the reason for this is that they are not really a rock n roll band.  Probably the real reason is ( like David Lee Roth said )that they don't look like rock n roll critics look, I'm no Roth fan but I beleive he hit the nail squarly on the head with that statement.  But when you think about it YES are about as close to rock n roll as say Pink Floyd is ( A band that IMHO deserves all the respect they get).  I myself am somewhat bothered by this lack of respect given to YES.  When I see these lists that people like U2 and the obscenely overrated R.E.M are always on, I just want to gag.  I recently saw the Spin magazine 50 greatest band list and it was enough to make me want to puke.  Red Hot Chilli Peppers! The Ramones! Husker Du ( or as I like to think Husker Don't )give me a break.  The Ramones wrote one song and they played it over and over 10 or 15 times on each of there silly records.  Comparing YES to these other bands I have mentioned is like comparing the SUN to a FLASHLIGHT ( YES IS THE SUN) <br />Oh yeah GOING FOR THE ONE is another masterpiece.  In fact, it is the 6th one in a row.  The other 5 being the 5 that came before it.  So while yes may be currently out of fashion ( we can thank god for that I'm sure )their 70's albums are all classics ( well maybe not TORMATO )and have not aged a minute.  In fact, they are still light years ahead of their time.  Highly recommended
0767830520|4.0|once again the deniro/scorsese team has struck cinematic gold.althought this was a little on the talky side,the construction of travis bickle made this well worth it.if harvey keitel's charactor was more antagonizing/involved,his demise would have been more effectual.i mention this because in a round about way,hes responsible for travis' transformation.nontheless,the simplicity of the story is genius.a lonely man with too much time to think on his hands.an insomniatic travis is hired as a cab driver to waste away his sleeplessness.while on duty,he encounters societies extremes.a chance encounter with a young hooker(jodie foster)changes him(more so than his brief affair with cybil sheppard)forever.in her,travis finds purpose for his life.this,coupled with the break up of his quasi relationship with the senetors aide(sheppard)pushes travis to the brink.although the VHS version is adequate,i would splurge and go for the DVD.either format,this is a great movie.1 thing though,THE INCIDENT(you know,that multiple oscar nominated FILM)costs more than TWICE this(and im talking about the VHS version of the all time classic THE INCIDENT).does this make ANY SENSE!?!?!?!?!?
B00003CXXP|5.0|Well I don't know why when this film was released, it was not critically acclaimed. This is of Speilberg's best work yet. Certainly more entertaining and unpridictable as E.T. Whoever wants to watch this film, I strongly reccomend it. But it's not really for children. Pleasant film.
6304457391|5.0|...The truth is this film should be watched once and then again and again until you are willing to get up and do something.  Now that the films basic and simplistic storyline have been supported by the now non-fiction book \\"Body of Secrets\\" by James Bamford and his surrounding discussion concerning Operation Northwoods. The film shows you how close fiction may have been to fact. In the film the liberal president wins.  But in reality what happened to that \\"liberal President\\" in the sixties.....Hmmmmmmm watch the film and read the book and don't forget we are only Americans when we are willing to love our country enough to dare to be Patriots.  Be safe and God Bless America!!!!!!!
0764005685|5.0|First of all, I'd like to start off with how I came to know this film. Ever heard of a videogame called Clock Tower? It's about a serial murderer, and has a Japanese prequal which I've also played.. Having liked that so well, I found on the internet that it was originally inspired by an Italian made, but English language, film called Phenomena.. I ordered it very eagerly,and couldn't wait for it to come in. When I finally got it, I watched it, of course...and loved every minute of it. It had everything I think a scary film should have! The characters, I believe, were developed enough, and I don't understand why so many people say Argento can't write them well. Maybe that's the case with his other films, but this one has quite well developed characters. We even learn the past of the most important characters, and I was actually sad whenever one of the more involved characters would die (The mark of good character development in horror) which is rare (In most of them, I'm alright just so that the main character lives). The plot was perfect, in my opinion. I didn't see any of the alleged plotholes. Sure, there were some things I wanted to know more about (Such as who exactly assaulted a certain person in a mental hospital) but very few, and nothing contradicted anything else in the plot: Jennifer Corvino, daughter of a famous actor, must stay in a Switzerland Boarding School for girls. Only there's a murderer around, killing girls around her age. She finds that she can communicate with insects, and has actually witnessed one of the murders while sleep walking. Along the way, she meets a crippled professor who believes her ability could help to solve the murders. It's far more developed than Halloween or Friday the 13th ever were, especially since all this was developed in (gasp) one installment (I've got nothing against sequals, but the original should also be able to stand on its own). The atmosphere in this movie was great, and it proves that the 80's really WERE the decade of the best horror films. The gore, while I don't need a lot of it in a movie, did add to some of the primal fear that the movie can generate. I only have one complaint with the music--when there are lyrical vocals, it sort of takes away from the effect. Otherwise, the music was wonderfully memorable! The special effects? Well, I'll never forget one of the more gruesome deaths. Here's a hint: It's the one Jennifer witnesses in her sleepwalk. One character in the movie is, in a sense, more terrifying than anything in any other murder movie. I love this movie! But if you're looking for more of the same, with a guy in a mask chasing people, look elsewhere--you never see the the films killer while in the process of a chase until the end. You just see the weapon. To me, that makes it better. Part of the suspense is wanting to see the killer, and boy is it ever worth the wait when you finally do! But it's not good for those who HAVE to see the murderer through every part of the film to enjoy it. This movie, as well as MANY aspects of it, lives up to the name. It is a real Phenomena. Perhaps the only thing more fascinating would be the reason why anyone would dislike it!decade of the best horror films.

B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is by far the best i've ever, ever heard! Before I got it from my friend at my 11th birthday party last year, which was Feb. 20th, 2001, I liked Limp Bizkit the best, and I still did for like, 2 or 3 months after having this CD, basically because I only liked 3 songs at first, then 4, then 5, then 6, and eventully all 12, even #11! If you've ever liked any nu-metal/rap-metal music, this will be perfect for you. That review that said they don't have good lyrics was basically..., because these songs have some of the best lyrics i've ever heard. Filled with catchy rhymes and good, hard guitars, this is a winner. Chester Bennington is a really, really good vocalist (and those of you who say he ...because he \\"screams\\" every once and a while aren't TRUE rockers, because if they were they'd know that's basically what most rockers do) and Mike Shinoda is a very good rapper, and I don't even like rap! Anyway, this is a very, very, very, very, very good CD and you must buy it...SONG REVIEWS!!!!:<BR>1.Papercut-5/5-A edgy rap cut with rap filled verses and metal driven choruses. Nice DJing!<BR>2.One Step Closer-3/5-You've heard it...I have so much it only deserves 3 stars it's so old!<BR>3.With You-5/5-The best song as far as lyrics go, with the same rap verses and metal choruses. Awesome DJing. Features The Dust Brothers. You can also get a live version of this on the Ozzfest 2001 album.<BR>4.Points of Authority-5/5-The best song on the album. Cool intro and guitars, and good singing and DJing.<BR>5.Crawling-4/5-See #2.<BR>6.Runaway-4/5-The poppiest song on the album. Emotional lyrics and good instrument-playing. I like Mike's part.<BR>7.By Myself-3/5-Like \\"With You\\", very good lyrics, but it gets old.<BR>8.In the End-5/5-Very strong song with awesone drumming, good rapping, and beautiful singing.<BR>9.A Place For My Head-4/5-\\"HEY!! I FOUND A SPANISH GUITAR!!!\\"<BR>10.Forgotten-3/5-The chorus makes you bang your head, but the verses take away.<BR>11.Cure For The Itch-4/5-Believe it or not, I like this song. It's all instrumental and done by their DJ, Joe Hahn.<BR>12.Pushing Me Away-5/5-Beautiful singing and lyrics. I swaer, I almost cried the first time I heard it.
0375507507|1.0|Another version of white settler life in Zimbabwe could be George Clark's work. There is some nuance there and some substance. There's little here in \\"Don't Lets...\\" In fact, for the many native people who lost their land, their lives and their dignity and customs, this book is dangerously irrelevant. Again, for those who need and demand more from a book that portends to be about a complex topic that forever remains in the news, Fuller's book is not for you. There's no denying it is for a few others who may be reading for some light entertainment versus those of you hoping for a fuller understanding of the so-called modern world filled as it is with tremendous suffering and strife.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I think Akira is one of the greatest anime ever. It was a magor breakthrough in Japanese anime. Every anime fan should own this. I highly recomend the special edition DVD, it is packed with extra features including capsule mode(which is very cool). Akira is set in the future in Neo Tokyo. Its very bloody but has a great story line to back it up. If you don't have this go get it now!
0767830555|5.0|Man, the 70s were chock full o' excellent films.  From \\"MASH\\" to \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" \\"Network,\\" \\"Nashville,\\" \\"Days of Heaven\\" and especially \\"Taxi Driver,\\" the 1976 Martin Scorsese-directed grungy, street-level study of alienation.  Robert De Niro, memorable as the young Don Corleone in the second \\"Godfather\\" movie, brings us into the closing decades of the 20th century as Travis Bickle, the obscure and troubled cabbie.  This remains one of his signature portrayals.<BR><br />Primarily a character study with only a bare-bones plot, \\"Taxi Driver\\" reveals Bickle, whose experiences in Vietnam have left him a shell, a soft-spoken insomniac with a never-ending monologue about the sordid things he encounters while prowling the mean streets of New York.  He drives his cab through rain-washed streets and kills time in porno theaters, cut off from the rest of humanity for reasons even he can't fully comprehend.  Eventually, he meets and attempts to woo two women who will change his life:  Jodie Foster as a teenaged prostitute, and Cybill Shepherd as a dedicated campaign worker.  Unfortunately, Bickle's inability to articulate his torment and his mental problems inevitably lead him down an increasingly shadowy path.<BR><br />The film's climactic confrontation (between De Niro and Harvey Keitel as a pimp) scorches and burns but fails to provide a catharsis for De Niro's character (as it would in a lesser film), and its enigmatic ending remains much debated.  This is a dangerous film, seemingly as lethargic as Bickle's speech but, like the character himself, capable of erupting in violence.  John Hinkley would later use this film's political assassination plot as inspiration in his own pursuit of Jodie Foster; it's difficult to view the film without that association.  But this is a must-see, must-own film for serious buffs, DeNiro and/or Scorsese fans.<BR><br />Brilliant comedian/filmmaker Albert Brooks has an amusingly neurotic role as one of Shepherd's colleagues.  The always excellent Peter Boyle also stars.
B00004Z311|5.0|I have to say that as far as fantasy movies are concerned this one goes hands down as the best made up until last Christmas's release of Lord of the Rings , The fellowship of the Rings. This early appearance of Tom Cruise as Jack the leaf covered boy brings back such memories of the mid-eighties. I remember memorizing many of the lines uttered by the evil character played by Tim Currey. \\"Every wolf suffers flees, tis easy enough to scratch!\\" and I *hated* the fact that the movie had to end. It is pure fantasy and has the magic of reading some of the best books, you don't want to leave the screen. I say this with a history of fantasy, illustration , comic books and sci-fi in my past and current list of interests. This is a great movie. I was very dissapointed at the first delay of the DVD release, but I sure hope the release date on the Amazon home page (at this date) of 2010 is incorrect! I can't wait that long to see this movie and be transported back to the magic land of the living Unicorns. This is a great movie for Fantasy fans and its just acceptable for your mature children to watch as well.<br />Highiest Possible Recommendation
B000003TAW|5.0|As I was sifting through the Cd collection at my house I found this, and then i started blaring and found out what i was missing.  I love this fu&lt;king SH!T
B00005QIPH|3.0|I don't get the Television or Stooges.  The Strokes are pretty good, but they lack the artful elegance of Television and the genuine rawness of the Stooges.  They sound more like a version of Blonde Redhead which has been dressed up in its Sunday clothes, and since B.H. can be seen as a descendant of Sonic Youth, descending from Glenn Branca, descending from . . . it's endless.  Regardless, the Television and Stooges comps. are off-base.  Again, I like this album, but don't bother trying to claim they're 1/3 Spaceman 3 + 1/3 the Slits + 1/3 Plastic Bertrand (which I wouldn't suggest attempting in front of anyone who's every listened to more than 10 bands); instead, just realize that the Strokes have borrowed alot, injected some ethusiasm, and put out a pleasant listen.  (Spending too much time comparing them to other bands really only displays different listeners' levels of musical ignorance)
0786867973|1.0|There is not one photograph of the majorly saucy Nigella (except on the back of the dust jacket.)  The publisher just doesn't get it.  Who cares about the food? The male reader wants to see Nigella in all her cashmere twin-set glory slapping the meat around, licking her fingers, etc.  This reader has ordered  &quot;Nigella Bites&quot; which he hopes will be more to his taste.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes don't appear to be the most talented band ever on their debut album, as many of their riffs are stylized punk riffs, and the average song contains 3 or 4 chords. However, there is definately talent here, just listen to the guitar solo at the end of &quot;The Modern Age&quot;. Or listen to the bass line and guitar solo on &quot;Alone, Together&quot;, or all the instruments on Someday. Also, this is one of the most fun rock albums to listen to ever. Buy this album and take a drive down the block listening to it and you'll end your drive with a smile on your face. The way the drums, guitar, and vocals blend is what makes this great music. I think it may be impossible to listen to &quot;Soma&quot; with out bouncing your knee at least once. &quot;Last Nite&quot; is, like all the songs on this album, a great blend of the different instruments and incredibley catchy. Some of the songs sound slightly similar, but not to the point where it is a bad thing, there is just enough diversity between all the songs to make each song new and interesting. I think the best song on The Strokes debut album is definately &quot;Someday&quot; though. It is just a great song through and through, no particular reason, everything on this song is great and flows together wonderfully. This is definately a CD you should be able to listen to from start finish without even thinking about skiping to the next track. If this is the future of rock n roll, then I'm pretty happy. It's definately better than the majority of rock from 1997-present. I could see The Strokes along with some other bands like them ushering a new golden age of rock, which hasn't really been seen in my opinion since the grundge era and the years following. But, back to the point, this is a great CD, and is highly reccomened for everyone, not just rock fans, because it's just plain fun to listen to.
B000002UAU|5.0|As a \\"fossil rocker\\" who well remembers the release of Sgt. Pepper, I can tell you it was a singular event. To analagize, this effort by the Beatles was like T.V. going from black and white to high definition color. I remember listening to this on vinyl through headphones and actually watching the album transpire in my mind, as if a fore runner to videos or DVDs. From the lush sounds of the orchestra tuning up, only to explode into the title track, all the way to that final expansive chord in \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" sets THE standard for true musical genius. As I recall, this was the first 16 track pop recording, the first western pop album to feature an all sitar, eastern instrument track, (George Harrison's \\"Within You, Without You\\"), the ONLY rock album I know of featuring a caliopy, and the truest example available of that all too distant star so many of today's so-called geniuses can only dream of reaching. This installment into the Beatle's catalog stands alone as THE BEST OF THE BEST, FROM THE BEST!!! After all, who ranks higher than these guys?? What other Beatles album had more of an impact on the way pop/rock music is recorded and produced??? Long after the Backstreet Boys are the question to an answer on Jeopardy, music scholars will still be studying this title with awe and amazement, and rightfully so. There's just nothing else, before or since, that will take you to those special, magical places inhabited by Sgt. Pepper.
B00004T8RK|3.0|There isn't a lot of good music out there today, and what good music there is stays underground or gets minimal airtime. Pearl Jam is one of, if not the best band of the 90's and I think everyone of their albums excpet for this one is a 5-star album. I realize they have the addition of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, but the drums are not much better than they were when Jack Irons was at drums, if at all. Besides that, this album is just lacking of new sounds or any inspiring sounds at all. This is very uncharecteristic of Pearl Jam. Light Years and Of the Girl are above average songs, and a good lsitens, but the rest of this album is very average. When compared to most mainstream music today, this album is good. But when compared to the other Pearl Jam Cd's, this album is bad. If your going to buy a Pearl Jam album, this should be the last one you buy.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I was very impressed with these two discs. I tend to like the second disc a little more than the first because it leans a little less on the metal stuff, but these guys are great musicians and have become good songwriters as well. I believe the addition of Jordan Rudess really completed the band, whereas before he joined they were a bit less progressive and a  little more metal. Now I think they have the perfect combination. My favorite track is Solitary Shell. The fantastic lyrics say it all. I saw Petrucci on tour with Steve Vai (G3) and he was excellent. Loved his solo band (which also included Dave LaRue on bass). Transatlantic are excellent also. Check them out! Also check out the Flower Kings - they are one of the very best progressive bands around!
B0000027RL|5.0|This album is Pearl Jam's debut album and also one of it's darkest and explosive. Having a dark, simple sound that is in many ways all it's own, Ten is one of the greastest albums of all time. Pearl Jam is one of the greatest bands of all time, and is one of the few great bands of the 90's. Their albums following Ten are mostly better, excluding binaural, but this is definately a great album that was in my opinion the best album of the grundge period. It is a much more intricate and emotionally driven album then Nirvana's Nevermind, and is overall a more rewarding listening experience. Later Pearl Jam albums like Vitalogy and No Code are considerabley better than this debut release, but this album is a good way to introuce yourself to Pearl Jam, and besides other Pearl Jam albums, and a few gems from other bands, one of the best albums of the 90's. The guitar riffs of songs like Once and Black will elctrify you, and make you truley appriciate the great sound Pearl Jam has brought to the music scene. Evenflow and Alive are also great tunes, and Jeremy is one of the best lyrical songs ever. This album is highly suggested.
B000002OZY|5.0|There might not be so much stigma for the term.  Forget for a minute--better yet, for 75 minutes, the running time--that Tommy never became the musical, the film, or the opera that we all wished it could.  Instead remember that this is some of the most inspired work the Who, which is to say anybody, ever produced.  Remember that the narrative, while coherent, is little more than an excuse for songs.  There is a reason the 1975 film was a musical from start to finish--the story would have sunk otherwise.<br />But what songs!  1921 enchants, while Christmas seamlessly blends joy, sarcasm and wonder.  The highlight of the album comes late in the story with Go to the Mirror and Roger Daltrey's effervescent delight, Sally Simpson.  Best of all, the pacing is perfect.  The overture contains elements of its climax and the finale, and the weakest material (Cousin Kevin) hides in the middle.  <br />What makes Tommy most impressive is that it was not dreamed up by conceited artists accustomed to hearing how great they were from music intelligentsia.  Rather it was the work of 4 upstarts in their early and mid-20's who were most famous at that point for angst-ridden songs.  The angry My Generation, the frustrated Can't Explain, the sly Pictures of Lily and the resigned Kids are Alright all keep appealing to teenagers even as the Who have grown to grandfather age.  Just before Tommy, the Who's assaults on stage equipment and hotel rooms were stuff of legend.  Starting with Tommy and continuing through Who Are You the delinquents found creative outlets for the rage, the fear and the angst.
0780628551|4.0|Two astronauts lose contact with NASA for two full minutes during a routine repair operation on a satellite.  What happened during those two minutes becomes the center focus of this movie.  Spencer (played by Depp) and his partner return to Earth, but the partner dies and Spencer isn't quite the same.  That isn't apparent at first until a former NASA employee tries to contact Jillian (played by Theron).  Then the movie takes a sinister turn.  Is Jillian crazy, or is she pregnant with alien twins?<br />I enjoyed the performance of Depp and Theron.  They have a chemistry that I haven't seen between two actors in a long time.  The special effects were good, but I had to turn up the volume to hear the actors' voices over the sound.  I give this movie four stars because of the climax.  Rather than give it away, I'll say that it didn't fit with the natural laws of science.  Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie.  It has a cliffhanger, which suggests a sequel.
B00005NGZX|5.0|breathtaking. simply breathtaking. converge has done it again with 'jane doe', they're third full length release for equal vision records. the metal/hardcore all stars from boston pull out all the stops on this album, seamlessly blending all the best elements of hardcore, punk, metal, thrash, and yes, even emo(shudder!). jake bannon's trademark barking/screaming vocals are at an all time best on this album,with some of his most poetic lyrics ever,and the dual guitars of aaron dalbec and kurt ballou are downright creepy at times, such as the staggering melody of the song &quot;thaw&quot;. the album opens with the thrashy song &quot;concubine&quot; and only gets better from there.the mood of this album is often tough to tell at times, due to the lyrics often being very sweet and nostagliac but being sung to the band's dark metallic riffing. while at times the band gets outright wacky with the song structure and music, the album stays coherant, especially towards the end. the album culminates with the epic eleven minute long title track, ending with bannon screaming 'run on girl, run on' over and over again while the music builds towards a agonizingly powerful climax. if you like converge, get this album. if you've heard of converge and would like to get into them, get this album. again, breathtaking
0743420373|5.0|Just so you are warned, in the beginning the book has a hard time catching your attention, and I think it is because of the incredible amount of stats about the rich (and not so famous) of America. This is something you get used to, since it doesn't change: chapter after chapter these two Ph.D's support their research with a massive amount of data. However, the real meat of the book is summarized in these seven common denominators that the authors found underlying all those who succeed at building wealth:<br />1) They live well below their means. They live frugally by operating on an annual budget, knowing how much they spend in each category, having clearly defined financial goals and spending time planning to achieve them.<br />2) They allocate their time, energy, and money efficiently, in ways conducive to building wealth. They plan, they budget, they are active investors.<br />3) They believe that financial independence is more important than displaying high social status. They don't think that you are what you drive: in fact, most of them don't spend money on cars of the current year.<br />4) Their parents did not provide economic outpatient care: they were not helped economically by their parents, at least not in a way that built financial dependence.<br />5) Their adult children are economically self-sufficient: they don't stimulate economic outpatient care, they teach them to &quot;fish.&quot;<br />6) They are proficient in targeting market opportunities.<br />7) They chose the right occupation.<br />To close, I'd like to quote what I consider to be one of the wisest pieces of advise in the book, since it touches on a huge component of the expenses of most people, their home: &quot;If you're not wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your householf'd total annual realized income.&quot; Amen! Complement this reading with &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; and you will have paved the ground toward financial independence and building wealth.al independence and building wealth.
B00000F14B|5.0|When I buy a DVD, I am usually looking for two things.  IF it is a musical, then I am looking for a WIDESCREEN presentation.  Nothing is more annoying than watching a full screen version of a musical and seeing arms and legs (but not the whole body) coming into the picture a few times.  Second, I look for the extras.  The Music Man DVD version does not disappoint.  THe making of documentary is much better and longer than some &quot;featurettes&quot; found on DVDs.  If you are wondering whether to upgrade to DVD, have no fear.  It's a great one.

I understand and appreciate it's impact on how comic books are written, but I just didn't enjoy it.<br />However, I loved Batman: Year One.  Very dark, very interesting - a great read.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys Batman or enjoys superhero movies, but feel stupid reading comic books - trust me, it's not what you expect.
B00005Y228|1.0|... It's in the same league as Aqua's \\"Barbie Girl\\" album and The Baha Boy's \\"Who Let The Dogs Out?\\" My only question is: \\"Who let Kylie Minogue come back??\\"
6305910103|5.0|Paramount got it right once, and then never again.  The story has what you would want from Star Trek: A simple, understandable plot.  A philosophical discourse between McCoy and Spock. Tense, well paced, and it ended well.The special effects and costuming neither overwhelmed the film (as in Star Trek 1) nor were they lacking in any way.  The acting was subdued when it needed to be, and over the top (Khan) when it had to be.It even managed to avoid being cutesy or self-conscious the way later Treks seemed to be.  If you want to introduce someone to Star Trek, this is the one to do it with.
0767811070|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, and reccomend it to anyone. It is a stunning depiction of of how we live. I'm from Watts, CA, very close to Long Beach, where this movie was based, and have been there many a time. About ten years ago, when this film was made, I was 14, I remember crying during this movie because the same types of things were happening all around me. I was tough, and I wasn't in a gang, just like the kids in this movie, they weren't in a gang, they were just friends. I hate the people that say this was a gang movie, this wasn't a gang movie, this was a good movie!
B00005U1YO|4.0|This album has more balance than the other Chemical Brother's albums - not a great contrast of incredible and atrocious tracks.  However, it does have the great contrast of energy, like we saw in Dig Your Own Hole (take Setting Sun and Where Do I Begin?, for instance).  Hoops and The State We're In show the slower side of the album, while the beat gets more intense in Come With Us and The Test.  I don't have any track recommendations because all of the tracks are decent, which isn't usually the case with a CB album.  Unfortunately, none of them stood out too much, either.  <br />Don't expect another Surrender - Come With Us is much closer to the first two of the CB's albums, especially Dig Your Own Hole.  It actually feels like a mix of the styles of the previous albums.<br />Hard to say who'll like this album and who won't.  Seems like it always has something to offer, regardless of what you're looking for (Surrender's experimental style, Dig Your Own Hole's variety, or Exit Planet Dust's flow and transitions between songs).
B00005RFAI|4.0|No disrespect to Ludacris, but this second album from Pink should be called \\"Back for the First Time\\". This sophomore effort is everything Pink always wanted to do, so you might wanna call this a rebirth for her.<br />First off, if you're expecting Pink to sing those R&B tunes like she did on her first album, it ain't happening. She's into more rock-flavored tunes now, and it's a good thing too. Though Can't Take Me Home produced the hits \\"There You Go\\" and \\"Most Girls\\", the rest of the album was pretty lame. Thankfully, Pink brings the soul on some of the rock tracks here to produce a good mix.<br />For example, there's \\"Lonely Girl\\" featuring Where-Are-They-Now artist Linda Perry (of 4 Non-Blondes fame), and the song you've heard before, \\"Get the Party Started\\", a funky concoction of dance, '70's-style rhythm, and Pink's soulful/now rock-influenced voice. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is about Pink not wanting to be confused with other girl singers like Britney. But it's on the down-home-blues \\"Misery\\" (featuring Aerosmith's Steven Tyler) where Pink really shines.<br />Most of the material is produced by Linda Perry and Dallas Austin so M!ssundastood is part rock and part R&B. Also, having written most of the material herself, Pink is really a part of this project. This album doesn't have the \\"Dude, run out and buy this album!\\" quality that other albums at this time do, but this is an album that's worth a listen.
0780624890|4.0|Blade is one of those films that does an excellent job of providing great action without being completely brainless.  It's a great combination of a good story, great action sequences, and interesting characters.<br />Wesley Snipes does a great job as Blade, the half-human/half-vampire hero.  He plays the character with the same snarl that Blade has in the comic books, yet shows the softer side when needed, particularly when it comes to Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), the vampire hunter who helps Blade.  <br />The storyline is engaging and the dialogue scenes are actually very well done.  The vampire council in particular is very creepy and a very well done concept.<br />But where Blade truly makes its impact is in the action scenes.  The opening scene in particular is very well done and very cool.  Practically every scene from then on is outstanding and really gets the adrenaline going.  The final battle in particular is well choreographed, although the ending is a little strange.<br />With the sequel coming out soon, now would be a good time to get acquainted with the original.  I highly recommend Blade to anyone who's a fan of the horror/action genre.
B00004Z459|4.0|This is a rarity for rock albums. Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory (their former group name to those who don't know) has songs that don't all sound the same. Okay, so it's not all rock. This is a rock/rap collaboration, but they even do THIS right.<br />Produced by Don Gilmore, this album features such mind-bending gems as \\"Crawling\\", \\"Pushing Me Away\\" and \\"A Place For My Head\\". And talk about original grooves: \\"By Myself\\" has to have the dopest and most innovative rhythms I ever heard. <br />The band itself is a good collective as well. Chester Bennington does his fair share of screaming and singing that blends in well with the rest of the harsh music while Mike Shinoda kicks the rhymes well. Brad Delson rocks the guitar like a true pro and Rob Bourdon is a good backup while he plays the drums. And let's not forget the DJ Joeseph Hahn who does his thing on the wheels of steel for \\"Cure for the Itch\\".<br />Under 40 minutes in length, Hybrid Theory is just enough for you to get your rock and rap fix. Feel free to recuperate while you watch the commercial stuff on TV. When it's time to jam again, put this album in and/or wait for their next release.
B000059TPN|5.0|Jerry Bruckheimer might have made some bad movies in the last couple of years (Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, I'm looking at you!), but he and Don Simpson, along with director Michael Bay, teamed for one of the best action movies I've ever seen.  <br />Nicolas Cage is simply outstanding as Stanley Goodspeed, the FBI agent who is thrown into the hostage situation.  Rather than play the role like your typical action hero, Cage chose to make Goodspeed an Everyman.  While it's a little cliche, I haven't seen it done much better than in The Rock.  He reacts the way most people would to his first dive, his first dead body, etc.  <br />Ed Harris is also excellent as General Hummel, who is not the typical bad guy.  He really is more of a tragic figure and comes across that way on screen.  Hummel doesn't want to kill people, but he knows it's the best way to get what he wants.<br />But the best part of this movie is the chemistry between Cage and Sean Connery.  Up until the very end, you never know whether he and Connery are really on the same team.  But the interplay between the two is spectacular.  From the car chase to the final moments on Alcatraz, the two go back and forth like they were married.  They might seem like they hate each other, but you can see the mutual respect building.<br />The action scenes are also incredible, helped in part by the outstanding soundtrack.  The adrenaline runs high as Connery tears up San Francisco in a humvee, a massive gunfight takes place in the shower room of Alcatraz, and Goodspeed tries to disarm the rockets before the Air Force bombs the prison.<br />The extras in the Criterion Collection aren't great, although there are some really interesting ones.  The piece on Hollywood gunplay is really cool.  Otherwise, the other extras include footage from the premier and the trailers, which probably could have been fit on one DVD.  But the movie more than makes up for the lack of extras.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyonewho loves action.  The sharp script and outstanding action sequences make a great movie.
0345440757|5.0|I LOVED this book. I credit my son's fabulous sleeping habits to this book. The parenting style in this book is one I am extremely comfortable with &amp; have learned so much from this book. If you have a baby you MUST HAVE this book!
0553296981|4.0|This book is the diary of a young girl that came from a Jewish family during the holocaust.  It talks about her family and how they had to hide out so they wouldnt be captured and taken to concentration camps.  She had to live in an attic after fleeing her home so she wouldnt be found and captured by the Nazi troops that were occupying Holland.  Anne Franks father was the only one that lived and he returned to their hiding spot.  He found Annes journal there.<br /> I liked this book because it gave a very realistic view of how people had to live in order to stay free from the Nazis.  Although they were free from the Nazis that they were not free to live how they wanted.  They had to hide out so they wouldnt have to be locked up in a concentration camp and tortured.  By viewing Anne Franks diary it tells people what was really going on during the time of the holocaust and that is something everyone should know.<br /> By her diary being published it gives people a look into how horrific things were back then.  People couldnt be free to do what they wanted.  They were really imprisoned, even those who had not been captured by the Nazis.  This is something that everyone should know about and by using her diary it gives you are very up-front look at those times.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This soundtrack is beautiful.  The composer, and Enya, captured the very essence of middle-earth in this breathtaking score.  When one listens to the music, one can feel the mood of the setting and plot, relive it along with Frodo and the others.<BR>  <BR>Feel happy and relaxed while listening to the Hobbiton theme.  Cry during the Lament for Gandalf.  Be afraid while listening to the theme of the Nazgul.  The music is like the materialism of feeling.<br />I hold this score in very high esteem.  When I first heard the soundtrack, I thought it was great.  When I listened to it the second time, I was captivated by its beauty.  Just like seeing the actual movie.
B000003TAW|5.0|i'm not a music critic; i have no musical background. but, i do listen to as much as i can get my hands on. five years ago, i could listen to this album straight through over and over again, for a week or longer, and not be tired of it. i can still do this today. i've purchased much more music in between this time, but still come back to weezer every now and then. other bands come and go, but i'll always have weezer.
B000002UAX|1.0|Time waits for no one. This album might have been intresting when it was released, but since then things have changed. Anyone who still calls this album the best or most important in popular rock music must be sleeping or already dead. I'm a very open minded person, especially when it comes to music, and I also gave this album a lot of time and several listenings, but I can't find anything here wich hasn't been done much better since then. Don't get me wrong: The Beatles were a great band who created a lot of wonderful music, and you'll definitely find some of it in here - but the hype about the White Album is just ridiculous. If you're intrested in music history, then maybe this one's something for you, but even then only out of general interest. If you're expecting the religious experience the reviewers obvisiously had, you'll be VERY dissapointed. <br />If you want to hear a peak in popular rock music listen to (for example) \\"Use Your Illusion I & II\\" by Guns N' Roses. These are the kind of albums that deserve all the praise the White Album gets. These are the kind of albums that will have a huge impact on you. These are the kind of albums that will keep you busy for years. The White Album is just something that looks good on the shelf and on \\"Top Ten\\" lists of those who want to but never will be cool, sophisticated and educated, cause they just don't get what music really is about.<br />I don't mean any discrespect to The Beatles or their fans, but enough is just enough. People should just listen to music with their ears and with their hearts, instead of mistaking their own CD collection for a museum. Select your CD's by YOUR personal preferences, not by their status. If you like the White Album by The Beatles, then you should definitely own it. But that's the only reason for owning it. You're still reading this, but you still don't know if the music in here is good or not? Well, download samples, rent it from a friend and see for yourself. Just remember: the less you write, read and talk about music, the more you can listen to it and the better chances are that you might get something out of it. And I guess that's what it's all about, isn't it? <br />The one star represents the way poeple treat music, not the value this album. I'd rate it solid 3 out of 5 according to my own preferences.
0790729628|4.0|This is such a triumph for a science fiction film.  Such imagination that started the wave of other science fiction knock-offs.  This is the type of film that you could watch over and over again and always notice something new.  The future world that was created here is almost scary in how realistic it may be.  The grittyness, the commercialism and of course the super humans.  I did not enjoy this only because of it's visual feats but the story and acting were superb. I've always been a fan of Harrison Ford and this is propably a more physical role than for him than Indiana Jones was.  Other Ridley Scott recomendations: White Squall, Gladiator &amp; Hannibal.
6304385668|5.0|brilliant! <BR> I really think this is an excellent film and very well made.<BR>The special effects were really good and I'd reccomend this film to anyone interested in Irish history.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I'm sure you have heard a lot of reviews by legitimate reviewers out there that thought that this film was not as good as they expected.  Who cares!?  I'm sorry if it's not as good as Silence of the Lambs but it is still a brilliant film nonetheless.  My only disappointment was that Jodie Foster did not reprise her role, Julianne Moore seemed like a completely different character to me.  Hopkins was great as the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lector.  There are many sequences in this film that have impessed and disgusted people and they will never leave those people's memories.  I know that they're imbedded in mine.  But so what if it's not as good as Silence, it's in a class of its own and shouldn't be considered a sequel.  Other Ridley Scott Recommendations: Gladiator, Blade Runner &amp; Alien.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I've just read all 111 reviews before this one, and every one is enthusiastic.  I am an enthusiastic lover of the movie as well,...<br />... It is just to criticize the \\"machine for living\\" side of modernism (the Pruitt Igoe sequence, which must be read in the light of Charles Jencks' famous dictum that the destruction of that modernist housing project--depicted in the movie--ushered in the postmodern era, establishes this as a main theme of the movie), but you just have to relax and revel in the complex texture of the images.<br />For example, there is a scene in which we are presented with a row of electrical towers marching off into the horizon across the desert.  I used to see this only as an attempt to get us to say \\"Yuck!  Towers spoiling the pristine desert.\\"  After a few viewings it suddenly occurred to me that the towers are anthropomorphically shaped and the camera angle does indeed make them look like a serried row of giants which dwarf the desert.  Whether you agree with the movie's ideological bent or not, this is clever, beautiful cinematography (and Glass in fact has a very dire march behind this scene!).<br />Again, I think we are supposed to be horrified by the reused footage of the atomic tests, but the scene, with the accompanying score, is one of the most powerful and beautiful moments in the movie.  It has the effect of exciting wonder at precisely what the filmmakers probably want to condemn.<br />The movie's overstatement is probably due to the makers' strong convictions, which are far from contemptible, and their desire to compensate for the lack of dialogue to establish their themes (by the time the Hopi prophecies come up it's all over).  This has not, however, stopped them from creating one of the richest and most complex set of images I have ever seen, and the fact that one can continue decoding the images after years of repeated viewings shows that we were anything but being condescended to ...
B00004Z311|4.0|Since Ridley Scott is my favorite director, I decided to review all of his films.  This is not my favorite but the visuals did impress me.  I'm not totally into fantasy themed movies, so I tried to keep an open mind in viewing this film.  The Lord of Darkness is a great character mainly because of his looks - he doesn't look a...thing like the actor portraying him.  I fyou're a Tom Cruise fan, this is probably one of his worst acting performances. Yes, he was very young but they probably could have found someone else that could have pulled this off better. Recomendations of Ridley's films: Black Hawk Down, Gladiator & Alien.
B00005TT77|4.0|Tribute albums seem to be a dime a dozen these days. Everybody's doing them. One of the better ones to come along in recent memory is the soundtrack to I am Sam. Of the 17 tracks included here, there are only a few that will send you lunging for the skip button on your CD player. The fact that the majority these tunes are done as well as they are is an achievement in itself.<br />Things get off to a great start with Aimee Mann &amp; Michael Penn's \\"Two of Us\\" and Sarah McLachlan's take on \\"Blackbird.\\" The producers did a great job of picking the artists to do these two songs. Things quickly go downhill from there, though, with Rufus Wainwright warbling his way \\"Across the Universe.\\" <br />The Wallflowers turn in a fittingly retro-sounding version of \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and Eddie Vedder's solo rendition of \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" is notable as well. Ben Harper was the perfect choice for \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,' adding just the right amount of psychedelia to the song to make it sound authentic. <br />After suffering through Sheryl Crow's whiny version of \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" Ben Folds turns a respectable rendition of \\"Golden Slumbers.\\" It's a bit strange not having it followed by \\"Carry That Weight,\\" but he does a good job with the song. The Vines do a great job with the relatively obscure (that is, if any Beatles song can truly be called obscure at this point) \\"I'm Only Sleeping.\\" <br />The Black Crowes contribute what could end up being the last thing we hear from them, their version of \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.\\" The saddest thing about all this is that unless you see the band's name in the track listing, you'd never know it was them. There are only two instances on this CD where the artists take any real liberties with the tune. Chocolate Genius does an excellent job with \\"Julia,\\" and Grandaddy serves up a different take on \\"Revolution\\" (however, I'm not quite sure what to make of this one).<br />Heather Nova and Paul Westerberg both do good versions of their songs--\\"We Can Work it Out\\" and \\"Nowhere Man\\" respectively. Nick Cave ends the disc with the worst song of them all, \\"Let it Be.\\" I'll be nice and describe this one as \\"your father's Beatles.\\" Do yourself a favor and just hit the stop button before it gets there. <br />With a few exceptions, this is one of the best `tribute albums' to come along in a long time. Recommended for Beatle fans, as well as fans of any of the artists mentioned.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|&quot;Fear is a place&quot;, and it lives here in this abandoned mental asylum!  Although I grew up in Boston (and S9 takes place not too far from here), I don't think I am biased to this fantastically CREEPY film!  I've seen it twice now - in the theatre and on DVD and can honestly say that I am in love - with Session 9!  The lone fact that it is filmed entirely in the (once active) Danvers Mental Hospital, places S9 far above the recent cookie-cutter Hollywood haunted house flicks (i.e. House on Haunted Hill and the like) this place is the real thing - no goofy computer generated scenes, just a group of blue collar workers and this amazing building (similar to the Overlook hotel in Kubrick's classic version of the Shining - It's truly the best screen vision of any &quot;haunted house&quot; EVER on film.  If you enjoy a psychologically haunting film vs. a gore fest slasher flick, then odds are you will truly enjoy Session 9.  A warning...  Don't watch it alone...  Really!!
B00005JKYS|5.0|...has created a cinematic masterpiece.  In two hours plus he has accomplished a screen play that will glue you to your seat, make it hard at times to breath and make a cough seem irreverent. I am a 5th US Cavalry veteran serving in Vietnam and Cambodia as a rifleman.  For a veteran this movie is too painful, for all others it should be required viewing, maybe even mandatory high school curriculum.  To finish the movie the hymn written by Randall Wallace and performed by the West Point Glee Club, \\"The Mansions of the Lord\\" will destroy what is left of your soul.  The song, I can assure you will be a standard at West Point for the next 1000 years.  I can honestly say, when all is said and done, that Randall Wallace has quite possibly done as much or more for Vietnam veterans with this movie as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  Thank you sir from a grateful Vietnam veteran.
0671042858|4.0|With this book Stephen King proves one more time that he's one of the best in describing primary fears and feelings which sleep deeply inside a person until they break out. In \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" this person is a nine year old girl called Trisha. The fact that Trisha is such a young child makes you guess that she's never been in contact with those destructive fears up to now. This is the point which forces you to feel with her; to be afraid of the big bad thing that wants to find you at all costs and even - if you are very quiet - to hear Trisha's desperate breath and to feel its coldness on your back...<br />If I was you, I would buy this biting novel right away!
B00005Y228|5.0|What an amazing album. It is by far the best album of the year in my opinion. It was such a great surprise because I only bought this cd for the incredibly catchy first single Can't Get You Out of My Head.Each song sounds like a hit, and I never had so much fun listening to an album before. The best tracks include the equally catchy More More More, the sexy In Your Eyes, and the sweet and sensual Fever. Kylies voice is pure pop and she sounds perfect on each track, possessing a sensual quality that is missing in todays pop music. A classs dance album that should catapult Kylie to the superstar status.
B00005MAM2|3.0|I consider myself a big fan of anime, but...I must say I didn't like this DVD very much. I really liked Princess Mononokee and the such but this one was just hard to follow. Ok so a kid has super telekenetic powers and can blow junk up and i know he loses control of his powers but...whats the point of the severe case of elephantitis?(or hemerhoids if thats how u spell it)I really liked the fight scenes tho and thats why I gave it a 3.
0792844890|4.0|Oh, this is so funny. Rick Moranis is so perfect as Dark Helmet. Mel Brooks again shows his genius. Sure, I believe George Lucas is more of a genius, but Mel has comedy done to an art. The then-now scene is so funny and Dark Helmet telling Lone Starr that they are not related after the whole  I'm your father's, brothers's, cousin's, best friends ..... oh, hilarious. If filmaking was an Olympic sport- Mel would get gold, he has brought several outstanding films (Producer's, Blazing Saddles, Robin Hodd: Men in Tights).<BR>The swear words add to the hilarity, but it is interesting that it recieved a PG rating- but its still fine family fun.<BR>Buy this movie!
0449002128|4.0|It's the buzz word these days--closure. Well, you won't get any in this novel. Silva writes extremely well. He spins us around Europe. He takes us through market stalls packed with Middle Eastern humanity and stuffed with smells. Until the last twenty or thirty pages it was a great read. But what happened to the main characters?? They drift off alone, back to their own lonely and miserable lives. Come on! Even real people don't behave that way. Silva, really, what were you thinking?
6305910324|5.0|this movie is great if you are raising a child and he/she is playing a sport.  the movie does a great good of teaching your child that winning isnt always important its all about having fun.  i love this movie too bad its so hard to find on dvd.
B00003CX6P|5.0|It starts out with credits sequence that looks like it was designed by Saul Bass, the artist responsible for the opening credits of \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Psycho,\\" among others.  The script is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, the author of \\"Strangers on a Train.\\"  Gabriel Yared's soundtrack, particularly the \\"Crazy Tom\\" segment, features piercing strings reminiscent of Bernard Hermann's score for \\"Psycho.\\"  Matt Damon's character Tom Ripley leads a double life, much like Bruno Antony in \\"Strangers\\" or Norman Bates in \\"Psycho;\\" and has plenty of homoerotic give-and-take with Jude Law's uebermensch Dickie Greenleaf, much like Bruno Antony had with Guy Haines in \\"Strangers.\\"  Gwyneth Paltrow's Marge and Cate Blanchett's Meredith are willowy blonde women who have names starting with \\"m,\\" just like Janet Leigh's Marion (\\"Psycho\\"), Kim Novak's Madeleine (\\"Vertigo\\"), Grace Kelly's Margo (\\"Dial M for Murder\\"), and Tippi Hedren's Melanie (\\"The Birds\\").  A major character disappears halfway through the movie, much like \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Vertigo.\\"<br /><br />While it is undeniable that this may be the most derivative movie ever made, I suspect that Alfred Hitchcock, Bernard Hermann, and Saul Bellow aren't exactly turning over in their graves.  This is the finest homage to the masters as has ever been made.  Brian De Palma, eat your heart out!
B00000D9TK|5.0|Cline is the best singer ever. She makes the best albums, than any artist does! And that is saying alot. S'il Suffisait D'Aimer is the most beautiful French album by Cline and her other French album which is called \\"The French Album/D'Eux\\" is beautiful too. But S'il Suffisait D'Aimer is better. But my opinion is that I love both, it's just that S'il Suffisait D'Aimer is better. I also have \\"Dion Chante Plamondon\\" that one isn't as moving as these 2 though, but it is beautiful too. The songs that are fast  ones on \\"S'il Suffisait D'Aimer\\" are... On Ne Change Pas (We Don't Change), Terre (Earth, En Attedant Ses Pas (Waiting For His Steps), L'Abandon (The Abandament), Dans Une Autre Monde (In Another World). \\"L'Abandon\\" is my favorite song on this cd. It is a very very beautiful song. I'm learning French right now at School, and Celine's French music is helping me learn French alot, I already know much French from her French music, and I'm still learning at school too. So if you're a<BR>Cline fan, then I recommend this cd. It's worth every red single cent of your money. Au Revoir!!!! **J'Aime Cline**
B000063JZQ|5.0|Please ignore the poorly thought out review on this page.  Anyone with either a passing interest in Shakespeare or an appreciation of film should seek this out now.  Polanski, avoiding the trap so many other filmmakers fall into, makes a film based on Macbeth, not merely recording a performance of the play.  He has crafted a breathlessly paced film, making very reasonable cuts in the text in order to bring the film in under 2½ hours.  I have seen much longer versions that had no grasp of the play at all.<br />Polanski also wisely chose not to use well-known stars for the major roles; instead utilizing some of the best (and youngest) British stage actors of the time.  Jon Finch and Francesca Annis perfectly capture the most emotionally wrenched marriage ever, without the moustache twirling that finds its way into Shakespeare film adaptations too often.  This film is dark, muddy, and violent; it is not intended for children.  I have to assume that the people who complain about the violence in the film have never actually read the play.  And I hope, for the sake of their own sanity, they steer clear of Titus Andronicus, Richard III, Julius Caesar, Othello, and if beheadings put a bee in your bonnet, beware Cymbeline!  <br />... This is a raw, passionate telling of one of the great fictional works in the English language, by one of the great filmmakers of our time.  But wait for the wide-screen DVD.
B00003CXXP|3.0|the movie starts out with potential and turns into an unstable<BR>display of emotions...sappy. great display of special effects<BR>and overall cinematography.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is what american film writing is about. Reality,fantasy,and intrigue.
6305696071|5.0|The plot is so consistent with the Disney kids movies, \\"Helpless Princess, saved by the knight in shining armor\\". Other than not wanting to see countless generations of our daughters be brainwashed by this ridiculous stereotype of the helpless female, I love the movie.
1558216847|3.0|I think there is something of a credibility problem. For instance, going for days without water in the Gobi desert isn't supposed to be physically possible. At least it wasn't when I went thru survival school. Maybe it could happen but just too many amazing feats of endurance for me. As fiction, it's a fair read.
B000002LFZ|4.0|I bought this release when it first came out back in late 1988, and right off the top, it became one of my most frequently played CD's during my college days. The landmark hits are there, especially my favorite tunes from their 1977 release Rumours.<br />Thirteen years ago, I would have given Fleetwood Mac: Greatest Hits 5 stars, because it was perhaps the best way to compile just over 1 hour of Fleetwood Mac tunes and also because, at the time, it was rare if a single CD went 70 minutes or longer. But in a day and age where greatest hits packages are now expanded beyond 75 minutes, the absences of other noteworthy Fleetwood Mac classics such as &quot;The Chain&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot; seem to leave quite a void. An updated, digitally remastered release that would include these two tunes along with a couple of live performances will unequivocally earn a 5-star rating.
B000002C25|3.0|Much like the band, BE HERE NOW is an album you really want to hate. I was about 14 when Oasis made a splash over here in the colonies, and since then, I have fought an intense internal battle to avoid these guys altogether. The Gallagher brothers are complete jerks and their music (at first glance) often seems like no more than a complete rip-off of The Beatles. But I finally succumbed, and bought a few Oasis CDs just recently. Completely ashamed, I searched to justify my new title as \\"Oasis fan.\\" As hard as I tried not to like these guys, everytime I put on one of their records I liked them more and more. BE HERE NOW sealed the deal: I'm hooked. Firstly, I will concede that there are some serious problems with this record; almost all the songs are too long and the lyrics are at times banal. However, this is a great album; no one makes rock music like this anymore. Today's British music scene is dominated by bands like Travis and Coldplay who are, like Oasis, direct descendants of The Beatles...but isn't this OK? The Beatles are quite arguably the single most influential band in the history of rock and roll..don't we expect modern bands to sound like them? If sounding like The Beatles means infectious hooks, gut-wrenching emotion, and sonic sophistication, the music scene could use a lot more Beatles rip-offs and a lot less Trains, Matchbox 20s, Creeds, etc...I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys listening to rock. Skeptics, beware....this album may change your mind about Oasis.
B000002UC5|4.0|McCartney is a fine example of what a truly talented performer and songwriter can come up with on a very low budget. You do not have the added frills and orchestrations that make this sound like a potentially overproduced piece. Instead, McCartney basically coordinated his guitar arrangements with his piano and drum accompaniments.<br />Along with the soundchecks McCartney recorded during his last two world tours, Momma Miss America, OO You, and Valentine Day are as close as you will hear the former Beatle performing tunes in the garage band format. <br />Junk, Singalong Junk, and Teddy Boy are quite peaceful tunes added to the collection. Perhaps these further sparked what would later become McCartney's trademark style of writing songs that tended to focus on the lighter side of things.<br />And last, but not least, the tracks that truly stand out are the acoustic Every Night and the immortal Maybe I'm Amazed, both of which helped propel Paul's solo debut to #1 in the Billboard album chart.
B000060OFT|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio prior to seeing this film.  I did, however, enjoy his performances in a number of films (pre-Titanic)--What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, This Boy's Life, Basketball Diaries are the best examples.  Still, I find it strange that many reviewers find it essential in their reviews to say that they can't stand him and then, as if damning by faint praise, go on to praise his work here.  For me this was a great introduction to an actor who might just continue to surprise people for years to come.  That said, I found this film the perfect antidote to a lot of \\"heavier-than-thou\\" Shakespearean films that I've seen in years past in which nearly everyone speaks in some sort of high fallutin' toney Brit accent to accentuate every Shakespearean phrase until all the blood has gone out of it.  Listening to Shakespeare spoken in California Valley speak was a real treat.  The visuals were spectacular as well as the music and how Luhrman pulled the whole darn thing together into a fabulous better-than-MTV video. I can easily see why English teachers have found this to be indispensable in some classes when they want to reach kids who find the usual Shakespearean efforts to be flying beyond their interest.  As for the actors, I enjoyed each and every one enormously.  Claire Danes was a wonderful Juliet.  John Leguizamo, a scary Tybalt. Harold Perineau, a spirited and exciting Mercutio.  And on and on.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who isn't hidebound to the usual Shakespearean elocution and who has an adventurous spirit and an open mind.
B000002UAR|5.0|1966 was the year of two of rock's greatest masterpieces: The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles' Revolver, the latter of which is regarded as the greatest release of all time.<br />Revolver is unique, in the sense that you have the Fab Four portraying widely different attitudes. George stands out as an aggressor with the famous (some might say infamous) Taxman and the sexually explicit Love You To. McCartney's loverboy charm is present with Got to Get You into My Life and the well-harmonized Here, There and Everywhere, a song that sounds like a wonderful Brian Wilson creation, but McCartney, strangely enough, also contributes in this mix the immortal Eleanor Rigby, a tune that is perhaps his first attempt at, instead of focusing on terms of endearment, reflecting hopelessness and despair. Lennon, with She Said She Said, I'm Only Sleeping, and Tomorrow Never Knows, creates accounts of his drug-induced stupors. Ringo, though he did not write any of the songs, does display in Yellow Submarine an easygoing, hospitable personality that would befit an ideal host who could create a party atmosphere where none of the other three would feel out of place.<br />How anyone could coordinate songs whose ranges and themes do not come close to mirroring one another into a single disc is quite incomprehensible. But back then, with the Fab Four and the brilliant producer George Martin, virtually any kind of musical innovation was possible.
B000002UA5|5.0|Pink Floys at it's Bizarre best besides the piper album. Caution This is not your typical Floyd album ( Dark Side Of The Moon or Wish you were here, Division Bell Etc.)but for all your Hard Core Fans This is a must buy , it contains a live and studio album. The live album contains an awesome version of Astronomy Domine that's weird but awesome as well as their early cuts like Saucerful Of Secrets and Set Controls for the heart of the sun. the Studio side is basically an assembly of solo side projects which is really out there. I hope you enjoy it like I do .
B000053VAF|1.0|Kevin Smith proves once again that he can't do anything right. Please don't even compare him to Oliver Stone. With this unique spiritual odyssey into the comedic inner workings and inconsistencies of modern faith, Smith creates his most overrated film yet. Filled with many religious and mythical characters assembled from Christianity, ancient legends, and artistic license, Dogma is a irritating examination of the sensation, joys, and humanity of religions and should be construed as an assault on good movies in general. The plot tells the story of two banished angels who find a loophole back into heaven thanks to Catholic theology. Yet, who cares? The plot is bad bad bad. Overflowing with fantastically boring performances from Alan Rickman (The Voice of God), George Carlin (Cardinal Ignatius Glick), Chris Rock (Rufus the 13th Apostle), Ben Affleck (Bartleby), Matt Damon (Loki), Jason Lee (Azrael), Linda Fiorentino (Bethany Sloane), Salma Hayek (Serendipity), Alanis Morissette (See it for yourself), and Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith (Jay and Silent Bob), Dogma is too sickening and stupid for it's own plausibility. <br />Yet, its sheer lack of charm and absence comedic genius make it a jovial masterpiece of why american cinema ... As for the film's many religious dissidents, frankly, who cares? Now for the DVD package, Dogma has a fine anamophic wide screen presentation and just a theatrical trailer. Wait for the option loaded Dogma DVD ... before you purchase this terrible film. ...
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is definitely a great accomplishment for Incubus. If you are not a fan of this band, take note. Very few bands strive to and take pride in creating new music and exploring different sounds and styles with each new album. It's obvious this band does not want to be classified under only one genre.<br />It takes guts, confidence, and most importantly musical genius to be able to successfully produce music that can relate to all types of musical fans. This album explores the hard hitting sounds of Nice to Know you to the beautiful melodies of Wish You Were Here.  The various other tracks have a more foreign sound to them making it all the more interesting. This is one of the few extremely creative and eclectic groups out. <br />Morning View is truly one of those albums that can be enjoyed from start to end, every track is incredibly different but still manages to flow perfectly into the next. <br />This album is a must for any music fan.

D Trady drumming is amazing, as for brother John's 'Singing' is well mad.<BR>Not forgetting bass player Trevor (Bless Him)<BR>This album is must buy for any music fan.<br />Ps.

B00003CX7L|5.0|As good as the first, my son loves Woody, Buzz and the whole Toy Story gang.  A video I actually don't mind watching with him.  And of course he watches it over and over again, good one, we love it.
0380788624|4.0|For the most part, I truly enjoyed this book.  It was very well done.  There was a sense of humor which permeated the entire thing, lightening what could have been tedious or stressful moments.  After all, this is a book about systems administration, code breaking, and WWII!  Still, Neal Stephenson pulls it off!<br />I found that my favorite characters existed in WWII, I was not as interested in their descendants adventures.  Stephenson seemed to breathe more life into them.  From encounters with Komodo dragons to the mathematics of sexual biorhythms, Stephenson packs the World War II heroes with excitement and humor.<br />My only complaint about this book is that there are no female characters!  I'm not saying that there are no females.  There are.  But none of them are fully defined characters.  We don't know why Amy Shaftoe acts the way that she does.  We don't know much about her mother beyond the fact that she was Philipino.  Mary Smith is a complete enigma and Randy's first girlfriend is no better.<br />I'm not saying that they need to be the stars but there is no sense that they are real people with flaws and fitnesses.  I never really believed in them like I did the males.  No motivations beyond the cartoonish.  No surprises.  They were in most cases, furniture and window dressing.<br />If you can look past that, you'll enjoy that book.
0790729652|5.0|OK, great film buy it today. Good pictures, good sound. But y'all, I don't care how many features it has! It's a good film! But, features would make it better.<br /> Nicklson was a good bad guy, ya know what I mean? At first I was a little weary Keaton wouldn't nail Batman, but he nailed everything! The voice, movement, overall eveything! Oh, and I love Alfred. Always have, always will.  The most lovable characters are Alfred and Wuhl as Knotts. WUHL ROX!<br /> So basically, features or no features, buy it. I'm tellin' ya, it's awesome.
B000002IU9|5.0|In my opinion, this is the greatest Heavy Metal album of <BR>all time! It has the raw power, metal intensity, and the<BR>driving force that makes \\"Manowars\\" music so magical. If<BR>you're looking for a true form of metal unaffected by the<BR>trends of the modern music industry, this is it! This is<BR>their most technical and detailed album to date. I love<BR>the innovation of \\"Rhinos\\" drumwork, the double bass is<BR>some of the fastest I've ever heard! I wish \\"Scott\\" played<BR>more like him.And \\"Eric\\", well once again he is spectacular!<BR>\\"Joeys\\" production abilities really come to light on this<BR>album as well as his musical abilities. <br />This album will take you on a long journey into the world<BR>of the fighting spirit that lives within us all! It sends<BR>a message that tells us to never give up, believe in your<BR>own truths and overcome all the obstacles in your life.<BR>It's hard to pick a favorite song on this album because I<BR>love them all, but \\"Spirit Horse of the Chrokee\\", \\"Burning\\",<BR>and \\"Master of the Wind\\" are some of my favorites, it all<BR>depends on the mood I'm in though. Although I do like other<BR>metal bands, none have influenced me the way \\"Manowar\\" has!<br />So for all you new-wave rap metal fans, step out of your<BR>trendy shoes and stop trying to fit into what everyone else<BR>thinks is cool. Most of the music I hear in the mainstream<BR>is so boring and spiritually dead that I can't feel any kind<BR>of genuine emotion from it. They all sound so much alike. So<BR>come on and give this one a listen. This is what real Heavy<BR>Metal music is all about! And yes I take this music seriously, it's not just music, it's celebrating the triumph of the human spirit!!!!
B00005Y228|4.0|Since 1988's \\"Loco Motion\\" we here in America have heard very little from Kylie Minogue. Unfortunatley, this is all too common. It has occurred with dance/ soul divas before..most recently phenom Anastacia. But with the release of \\"Fever\\" Kylie Minogue said, \\"No more!\\" And much like Prince she declares, \\"Baby, I'm a star!\\" <br />Kylie recently had her first U.S. top 15 hit in over 14 years with the ubiquitous \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\" It's a great song which caught everyone's attention. Now they wil hear the rest of Kylie with her finely crafted body of work that she just released. The lp contains some of the best dance/ pop to be released recently. Stand out tracks on the album include \\"More More More\\", \\"Love at First Sight\\", \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Fragile\\". Another gem is the bonus hidden track \\"Boy\\" (#13) which could prove to be a major club hit as well. Slightly reminiscent of Madonna's \\"Music\\" this song could be a number one dance hit. <br />In all this album is very nearly pristine from start to finish. It does at times have its slip ups with songs better left to Britney Spears. But \\"Fever\\" is a more than welcome addition to the American mainstream and radio.

B00001ODGR|5.0|Truly great! I bought this on a whim... Of all my music DVDs, this one is without a doubt the most played. The band did a great thing when the rejoined and did this tour. <br />The songs are right on. So many memories... The video is incredibly crisp and clear. The audio (DD 5.1) is superb. When I play this DVD, I find myself standing in the middle of the room just mesmerized.<br />When I have parties, this is one of the DVDs that I put on to provide background sound and video. Everyone relates to these songs and this group. There's always a new story about a concert experience. <br />What a great live recording! I have 17 other DVD concert videos. This one is the most played.<br />Buy it! You'll like it!
0375703861|5.0|What a great book!  I borrowed this one from my sister, who said she could not get into it.  I got sucked into it right away, and am shocked that more people didn't love it as much as I did.  There are some really funny parts.  If your parents are immigrants from Asia, like mine are, you will probably appreciate the parts about the accents even more.  Check this one out - if you don't love it, pass it on to the next person you meet - I bet they will!
0140868445|5.0|Some books are better read, and some are better heard. The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature.
0800141326|2.0|This film is probably the best example of where movies are heading nowadays: big special effects, little or no plot.  The acting was terrible, as was the script.  It was meant to be funny and clever, I suppose, and it achieves the funny part, though it falls short of clever.<BR>As for the special effects, yeah, they were good, but they completely butchered Godzilla.  So the Godzilla in the original movie was a guy in a suit, but I can just imagine what the directors of that one could have done with some CGI!  In the new version, Godilla is just an overgrown T-Rex.  How does an iguana go from being a lizard to a bipedal, bird hipped dinosaur anyway, even through extreme mutation?  It's just cheesy.  Also, the baby zilla remind me WAY too much of velociraptors.<BR>Even if this film was meant to be a parody, as some have argued, it shouldn't have been.  They should have let some TALENTED directors recreate this story for all it's glory.
B00003CXTG|3.0|After being shocked by how the movie Titanic replaced historical authenticity with Hollywood, I was curious about how Pearl Harbour would treat one of the sacred events of United States history.  Unfortunately, it was not a whole lot better, and was the same formula:  A love triangle + an historically tragic event + special effects.  Like the Titanic, the first half of this movie revolves around a love triangle - this time the romance of a young war nurse with two friends competing for her love.  There are distinct overtones of the plot of Casablanca, as the one with whom she falls in love dies in a mission, and his love is replaced by his friend.  But is her first love really dead?  This all, of course, is not the story of Pearl Harbour, but a romance story where couples leap into bed with each other and do what feels good without the permanent commitments of marriage.  It is a more credible love story than that of Titanic, but immorality still features as a prominent ingredient.  And it's a story of romance which has nothing to do with history.<br />Of course history eventually does make an appearance.  Like Titanic, the real action everyone has been waiting for finally comes in the second half of the movie with the historic events of Pearl Harbour.  These are portrayed with blinding speed and frightening realism.  The footage of the actual attack is protracted at length - I could not help but wonder if it was longer in the movie than it was in real life.  But one cannot see this without being overwhelmed by the horror of war.  For many, violence in movies functions as entertainment.  For me, it functioned to show how horrible war really and the tragic death it causes.<br />... How realistic the portrayal of Pearl Harbour is I cannot say.  Certainly there are incredible special effects, this movie being the most expensive ever produced at the time of its production.  But in the end this isn't a movie about history, it's a movie about Hollywood, reflecting more the ideas and moral weaknesses of our current generation than the strengths of the generation that endured the reality of Pearl Harbour.  As a movie, Pearl Harbour didn't quite sink as fast as the Titanic, because it was more credible and true to its time. But in the end, like the boats in Pearl Harbour, it's still a sinking ship.ideas and moral weaknesses of our current generation than the strengths of the generation that endured the reality of Pearl Harbour.

B00000DC10|5.0|This CD totally blows me away everytime I listen to it.  This album is revolutionary.  Every person should be forced to listen to this.  When people say music can change the world, and can make a difference, this is what they're talking about.  This should be played on the radio.  This should be in the heads of every person alive.  It is amazing and just flat out great music.  Every song (and I do mean every single one) is beyond good, and can not be described.  Take hardcore, add elements from about ten or twelve differnt generes, an amazing vocalist, a superb performance on the drums, bass and guitar, stir them all together, and you get this.  The guitars are full and chunky in parts, and defined and clean in others.  The bass and drums do what they're supposed to do, form a perfect underlaying beat for the song.  Every aspect of this album is superb.  The layout, production, writing, playing, everything.  I love this album, and this band.  It's a shame they broke up, these guys could have changed the world.  They are legends, and I will never forget this band or this CD.  This truly changed the way I look at music and a few other things.  It can and will change you if you let it.  It is beautiful and brutal in every sense of the words, listen to this at least five times all the way through to get only a small, small portion of it's perfection.  Things will jump out at you and your jaw will drop.  You will be amazed.  I still am, and am willing to bet that I always will.  A must own. <br />-&quot;we lack the motion, to move to the new beat&quot;
B00005QIPH|4.0|&quot;Is This It&quot; is without a doubt one of the most original, fresh, and exiting albums to come out for some time. Musically, this album is unprescedented. To put it in simple terms, this is a fun album to listen to. The Strokes, highly looked upon to be the savoir of rock and roll, have put together a timeless album, one that will be remembered for quite some time.<br />However, this album isnt with out its critisisms. First of all, the lead singer sings all the songs through a megaphone. Yup, you heard me, through a megaphone. The music and arrangements throughout this album dominate this fact, but it must be said that this band has its flaws. Singing through a megaphone is a technique that when used sparingly can be very effective, but every song sounds as if it was created in a bathroom. Lyrics and vocals are an after thought in this album. Because the music is so good, they get away with it, but i cant help but think what could have been. A band like this doesnt come around everyday and with the aid of a capable singer the sky is the limit. <BR>Think about it, thats why Radiohead is so good, thats why the best bands are the best.  These guys are extremely talented, but they will never reach that plateau unless they get someone who can sing.
6305910324|5.0|For a lot people, watching chess is no more interesting than watching paint dry: boring.  Don't let the fact that this is a chess movie put you off into making the same mistake about this movie: it is not a boring movie.  In fact, it's one of the better movies of the nineties, sadly underrated.<br />It is mostly based on a book by the father of the chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin, which tells the true story of this boy's rise from obscurity to success in the chess world as a junior.  The timing, of course, is crucial: the movie was released in 1993, the year after the brilliant former world champion from the US Bobby Fischer came out of hiding after 20 years.  In 1992 Fischer defied an embargo on Serbia by successfully defeated his old Russian nemesis Boris Spassky in a rematch of the famous cold war world championship, and then again vanishing.  The Fischer-Spassky match was undoubtedly a catalyst for the making of the movie, with the media attention on Fischer's amazing victory and his eccentric disappearance making the time ripe for a chess movie to be palatable for the chess-ignorant masses.<br />But actually \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" is not about Bobby Fischer, nor is it first of all about chess.  Bobby Fischer's genius from childhood is the background for a study of the chess-playing genius of seven year old Joshua Waitzkin.  But in truth, the movie focuses more on the relationship between a boy and his father, who moves from the extremes of doubt about his son's talents, then pride and ambition, and finally a desire to develop these talents without hindering a normal childhood.  After hiring a professional chess teacher to tutor Joshua, his father comes to realize the danger of professional chess dominating his son's life.  What the movie portrays about parents of chess-playing children is a stark reality in most sports: it is the parents who are fanatic about their children's sports, and will do everything to make them succeed, placing their children under enormous pressure.  Joshua's father has to learn to rediscover a normal relationship with his son, and to relieve his son of the psychological pressure he has been under.  If only more of today's parents would learn the same lesson.<br />But despite the touching father-son scenes, the conclusion is still a predictable feel-good ending: a win at a high level tournament.  But that doesn't take away from the other aspects of the movie.  In the end, it's an intelligent movie that the whole family can enjoy without a knowledge of chess, but undoubtedly chess buffs will enjoy it the most.  The New York park scenes where druggies and other street people are playing two-minute blitz chess will especially be memorable and satisfying for chess aficionados.  But ultimately this isn't just a movie for chess nuts, it's a movie for everyone.  Aside from just a couple of rare incidents of profanity, it's clean, wholesome and enjoyable.  Which is a lot more than can be said for most movies nowadays.enormous pressure.

B0000048YM|4.0|This is a great restoration of the original movie.  And though I love Barbra Streisand, movie musicals in general and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; in particular, it really isn't for everybody.<br />Streisand gives her second most charming movie performance ever in this her debut (after &quot;What's Up Doc&quot;).  All the tics and mannerisms which later became tedious and uninspired, but here are fresh and engaging, are present.  The deep emotive sighing, the schtick (which she's somehow lost along the way), the kooky grin and histrionics.  Yes, it's a powerhouse performance and proves the old cliche that it takes a star to play a star, but the movie consists of almost 3 hours of unadulterated Streisand and no-one else really gets a look-in.  This seems very one-sided even to this Streisand fan.  There's no-one to balance her and enhance her performance which would have added a lot to the movie.  <br />This is Babs's movie all the way - great if you're a Streisand fan. If you're not, stick with &quot;What's Up, Doc&quot; where Bogdanovich surrounded the diva with a great comedic ensemble thus enhancing Barbra's presence rather than diminishing it.<br />As for the story, it's hokey in the extreme - a 1930's backstage musical stretched from 90 minutes to almost double that time.  This is mitigated by Streisand's sheer willpower to make it as a star, particularly in the first half (&quot;I'm the Greatest Star&quot; and &quot;Don't Rain on My Parade&quot; are the two standout numbers both musically and cinematographically).  I can't fathom what Herbert Ross and William Wyler were thinking of in the staging of &quot;His Love Makes Me Beautiful&quot;.  It looks like a tawdry 60's Las Vegas Revue filmed for the prurient US television networks and boy does it go on.  <br />The remastered color and widescreen shots are first-rate.  However, I found the remastered sound on the strident side especially when La Streisand lifts off in either song or dispute.<br />Yup a great additionto the Streisand catalog.  But be warned very long and overly indulgent to its star.
0871137380|5.0|I saw the film, and thought that as far as character development went it was lacking, but the bulk of the film that was concerned with the battle was brilliant.  So I was fascinated to find out that the film was based on a book.<BR>Mark Bowden has written Black Hawk Down in a very energetic style, so it reads like a fast paced novel, rather than a dry documentary of battle.  The book is divided into 5 sections, and each section contains about 20 small chapters each.  Each chapter is written from a different perspective, from one individual soldier, to a group of Rangers pinned down under fire, to young somali militia men fighting the americans.  All the perspectives have been gathered from records of radio transmissions, witness statements, and video shot of the battle from helicopters.  Because the book shows the perspectives of different people, and because the book is objectively written, it is possible to convey the motivations and actions of all involved, in a way that the film couldn't.<BR>The film tends to portray the Somalis as a faceless mob, without analysing how they could be so enraged with the americans that they would drag the corpses of dead soldiers through the streets.  The book goes into more detail about the tactical skill of the Somalis, and one can understand how the general population could be whipped up into such a lethal frenzy.<BR>All in all, this book is excellent.  I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the film, and to anyone who has even a moderate interest in either American foreign policy, how modern urban warfare operates, or understanding why america could become an object of hatred to so many people when their original mission in Somalia was a humanitarian one.  This book does not give easy solutions but shows how complicated things can become.  As the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
6305736650|4.0|This may be a black and white film from 1942, but its charm overcomes the limitations imposed on it by the technology of the day.  Casablanca is a war movie which features a unique and mysterious love triangle.  Rick (played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of Rick's Caf&eacute; in Casablanca, which is in the heart of unoccupied French territory in Africa and the last stop for defectors trying to escape the Nazis.  His old lover Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) makes a mysterious appearance with her husband Victor Laszlo who is a leader of the underground trying to escape.  Rick has always wondered why she strangely vanished out of his life in Paris, and it is this mystery that the film centers on.  Ultimately, someone must make an incredibly difficult choice, even if it goes against the deepest feeling of his heart.  There is more dialogue than action, but the dialogue sets up an ever-increasing amount of tension on several levels.<br />Most movie critics would regard the suggestion that it is not the greatest Hollywood movie of all time as blasphemy.  But in truth the plot is not always convincing, the opening is somewhat complicated for first-time viewers, and the corruption and greed is presented in an overly positive light.  And the passionate dilemma that Ilsa faces in whether or not to choose her long-lost love above her husband was daring even for the forties.  Surely as a married woman the morals of the time would demand an automatic choice for her husband, rather than follow the immoral desires of passion.<br />But how dare I suggest imperfection!  Casablanca is a clean movie, the acting is superb, the characterization beautifully portrayed, and above all it features a stunning plot with a thrilling climax.  It gained an Oscar for \\"Best Picture 1942\\" and many would not hesitate to give it an Oscar for \\"Best Picture Ever.\\"  Many of its lines - \\"here's looking at you kid\\" and \\"Play it again Sam\\" - have become trademark expressions in the English language.  It may have reached greater heights in terms of popularity than perfection, but there's no question that this will continue to be a must see long into the future!language.

B00004XPPC|5.0|\\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\" is an Oscar winning World War II film, loosely based on a book by the French writer Pierre Boulle.  However, Hollywood had to change the plot to make it more palatable to American viewers by introducing an American star into the cast.  The plot was also modified to accommodate a greater role for women: one female beauty makes a brief appearance, and several Asian women absent from the original novel play a key supporting role towards the end.<br />What makes this movie a gem is not just the exciting plot, although that is an essential ingredient in making this a successful movie.  A British contingent of soldiers in a Japanese prisoner of war camp are required to build a bridge across the river Kwai for the Japanese.  But because this bridge is a threat to the Allies, they send in a troop of commandos to destroy the bridge.  There is only one problem: the British commander (Colonel Nicholson) who built the bridge has taken so much pride in the construction work of his soldiers, that he does not want it destroyed.  The tension rises to heart-stopping levels, with a thrilling climax.  There is some violence in the movie, but it is minimal and only towards the end, and unlike modern war movies there is no focus on the gory details.  The climax features stunning scenes that at the time were unprecedented in movie making history.  And the ambiguity of the conclusion leaves plenty of room for after-movie discussion and contemplation.<br />But what really makes this movie so stellar is the characterization and the psychological conflict at the beginning of the movie.  What the second half of the movie offers in terms of intrigue and action, is more than matched by the psychological conflict in the first half.  The Japanese commander of the prisoner of war camp (Colonel Saito) requires British officers to perform manual labour.  Colonel Nicholson insists that this is contrary to the Geneva Convention, and together with his officers refuses to comply.  This battle of personalities is the feature of the first part of the movie and is compelling, gripping, and involves brilliant acting.  The repeated notion of \\"madness\\" also hints at underlying themes about the futility of war, making this a profoundly anti-war movie.  This is evident in the complete reversal of the British colonel's attitude to his officers working and the final lines of the movie about \\"madness\\".<br />Although not suitable for younger viewers because of the occasional intensity of the action and the themes of war, \\"The Bridge On The River Kwai\\" is generally a clean and wholesome movie when compared with modern movies.  Given that the cinematography, characterization, and acting are all superb and thought-provoking (as well as the enduring whistling tune of the \\"Colonel Bogey March\\"), it is little wonder that this film rightly takes its place among the all-time war movie greats.

B00003CXXP|3.0|I decided to rent this one before buying, and I'm glad I did.  The trouble with AI is that it is an attempt to merge two completely different styles of directing into one film.  Both Kubrick and Spielberg have made some great films, and also some awful ones.  In the good ones, Kubrick films impart the viewer with a sense of something unfinished, worthy of further contemplation.  Spielberg's better films are designed to leave no doubt about how he wants the audience to react to a particular scene.  Putting the two together creates more than a little confusion.  <br />In a nutshell, Kubrick wants you to think, while Spielberg wants you to feel.  For me, I just couldn't feel for the mecha-child, and the ending was scripted as typical Spielberg, so there was no opportuninty for much thinking.  If you're looking for a similar-themed film, I would reccomend Bicentennial Man, excellently played by Robin Williams.  <br />It seems like most people reviewing this film either loved it or hated it.  I'm guess I'm neutral on it, it wasn't a bad film, but it was lacking the substance to be a good film.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Steven Speilberg's Hunting Masterpiece is one of the most vissuely stunning,Mysterise,Compelling,complected,and orignel films ever made. Stanley Kubrick was trying to get this film going for 15 years and never could. So he gave it to steven speilberg a long time friend. Kubrick felt Steven could do more with the movie than he could he gave it to him because he know he could pull it off and he did. People think kubrick would of did better with the movie. But what people don't understand is he gave the production to Steven because he didn't want it because he was having such a hard time with it so thats what I heard. As far as the DVD goes its one of the best out right now. I named the A.I. the best film of 2001 and is and may very well be the greatest sci-fi film ever made.
B00003CXA2|2.0|Forrest Gump is the story of the life of a retarded man who lives through epic events in American history: JFK, Nixon, Vietnam War, etc.  His life touches most of these significant ways, such as by accidentally discovering Watergate.  He becomes famous after rescuing several soldiers in the Vietnam War, and achieving remarkable success in international ping pong.  But his heart's desire is his childhood friend Jenny, who is one of the few who shows compassion to him.<br />The insight into the life of a retarded man is wonderful.  And the acting, particularly of Tom Hanks in acting Forrest Gump, is remarkable.  Some of the special effects (eg the ping pong playing, the inclusion of Forrest Gump in real newscasts of US presidents, John Lennon, etc) are astounding.  The DVD features an explanation of how these special effects were accomplished, and they truly are outstanding.  The concept is great, but the way it is worked out is a typical Hollywood disappointment.<br />Because these are the only positives about the movie.  Several concerns:<br />1. Adult themes.  The rating is only PG 13, but there are many scenes with violence, drugs, nudity and sex, themes inappropriate for children.  The language is mostly reasonable, but there are multiple incidences of strong blasphemy and foul language.<br />2. Lack of moral absolutes.  Forrest Gump represents innocence and naivity, but yet he is corrupted by Jenny, whom he eventually sleeps with.  Even after he fathers her child outside of wedlock, she assures him that he has done nothing wrong. Jenny's death is apparently due to her lifestyle (due to her drug problems, STDs or AIDS?), and yet the dangerous consequences of an ungodly lifestyle are never connected or clearly spelled out.  She seems to represent all the dangerous things of the sixties.<br />3. Atheism.  Gump is one of the few individuals who believes in God, but this is presented as part of his retarded thinking, which like in other areas, is out of date and inaccurate.  This is especially clear in a blasphemous scene where his friend challenges God to sink his boat.  As it turns out, God loses, because every boat is sunk except theirs, and they become millionaires as a result.  Christianity is clearly presented as irrelevant for modern life.<br />4. Self-determinism.  The movie starts and ends with a fluttering feather.  It's a very religious symbol, as the movie itself explains with several discussions about \\"destiny\\".  Destiny is partly the random fluttering of fate, and what you make of it yourself.  Forrest partly triumphs by his character, but also the whims of fate (eg the success of his shrimping company is pure \\"chance\\" after all other boats sink).  God's involvement in the world is clearly rejected in favour of self-determinism.  This is a strong theme in the movie, and a dangerous one.<br />5. Trivialization.  Key events of American history are presented through Gump's eyes.  While it gives insight into a retarded man, at the same time these key events are downplayed and presented as trite and almost laughable.  Some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century are trivialized.  This reflects the failure of most Americans to treat life with the seriousness it deserves.<br />All in all, while this movie had aspects of warm humour, it also showed the spiritual bankruptcy of a modern America that has rejected God and is no longer rooted to moral absolutes.  The fact that this was awarded the Best Picture in 1993 and received a bag-load of Academy Awards just proves that it is indeed representative of modern thinking.  Interestingly some critics believe that this movie is an attack on liberalism, lambasting promiscuity, atheism, and the entire counter-culture of the 60s.  I wish it was, but the very fact of its immense popularity among modern viewers suggests that - sadly - this is not the case.  It's a sad reflection of modern American, and its popularity just confirms how accurate this portrait really is.ally is.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Please don't say that this film has no plot. Its plot is tight and sound - you just have to look for it. Once you find it, it's heartbreaking and brilliantly conceived. That's what makes this such a fascinating movie - it allows you to discover its meaning on your own. I haven't had that much fun at the movies in years.<br />And Naomi Watts was robbed by the Academy. She was by far the best actress last year.

0792156684|2.0|Titanic may have been a movie that garnered a record number of academy nominations and awards.  But that doesn't make it a great movie, and here's why.  Basically the movie consists of two separate halves.  In the first half, the Titanic is merely the setting of events, because the story revolves around a forbidden romance between a poor young man called Jack, and an upper class lady Rose who is engaged to be married, her fiance also on the ship.  But this classic love triangle is more representative of 1997 than 1912.  Rose is introduced as a dignified upper class lady, but is soon spouting off profanities and makes obscene ... jokes with allusions to Freud.  And surprisingly, one moment she hates Jack, but the next moment she is posing nude for him, and romping around naked with him in a steamy scene in the back of a vehicle.  Not only is she applauded for being unfaithful to her fiance, but she tops it off by walking off with his diamond although his insurance company makes a heavy loss on it.  This kind of language and behaviour may be normal for 1997, but it certainly was not in 1912.<br />The second half of the movie is much better, picturing the actual sinking of the Titanic, and Jack and Rose's mad struggle for survival.  Hollywood has outdone itself in recreating the sinking, with epic scenes of struggle and survival.  This is probably the only thing the movie has going for it, but even this is rather overdone and overly dramatic.  And the historicity of many events that occurred during the actual sinking seriously needs to be questioned. The movie presents a small Christian group praying for help in an escapist manner that is rather outlandish and out of touch with reality; while in reality the majority of people of the Titanic were Christians and sang hymns and prayers as the boat sank.  The movie presents the captain as a suicidal selfish and incompetent..., while in reality he was speaking encouraging words from the ship until the very end.  The movie presents the upper class as selfish survivors who lock the oppressed lower class in the lower decks of the ship for a watery grave; while in reality it was an equal number of upper and lower class that perished. Incidentally the movie relies here on a horribly inaccurate clich&eacute;: the wealthy are selfish, greedy and dishonest (Cal), while the poor are selfless, generous and loving (Jack).<br />Pointing these historical inaccuracies out won't make me popular, but it doesn't make them untrue.  The truth is that portraying a historically accurate version of the Titanic sinking would not be popular to today's masses.  Today's masses want Hollywood, not history, they want the immoral, not the moral.  It's little wonder this movie was more Hollywood than historical.  And it's little wonder it was so popular for the people of 1997.  That, to me, says it all.  The people of 1912 would have been horrified.  Too bad, because it's precisely the 1997 aspects of this movie that turned this movie into another sinking ship.resents the upper class as selfish survivors who lock the oppressed lower class in the lower decks of the ship for a watery grave; while in reality it was an equal number of upper and lower class that perished.

6305127638|5.0|Time travel is a subject that is far too common in the Star Trek universe, when I first found out that time travel would be a focus of this movie I was worried that it would [NOT BE GOOD]. Thankfully this movie turned out to be the best entry in the series. The character of Picard finally showed a ruthless dark side that was in many ways as terrifying as the Borg he was so desperate to destroy. It's side of Picard that is rarely seen and very welcome. Picard has usually been the disciplined, yet kind hearted captain, and my favorite of the various Trek captains, so to see that he can be more than annoyed, to see that he can genuinely hate and hate with such an intense passion as to kill the Borg as ruthlessly as he did was a suprise, not out of character, mind you, just something that is rarely seen. The development of Data was nice as well. Data's child like innocence seemed destroyed in this film by the disturbing Borg Queen, who was played very well. The acting in this movie is stellar, which is not abnormal for the TNG crew as thet are all great actors. And to see the sides of these characters that is so rarely seen, thier dark sides, made this movie fantastic, even if the time travel bit is getting old, especially in Trek.
0812550706|5.0|Riveting from the beginning, Ender's Game is an excellent read. Orson Scott Card captures the reader's attention with his innovative style.  Card sets the pace of the characters in chapter one; there is not a dull moment in the story.  He uses the wisdom and common sense of child geniuses to save the world from an alien invasion that adults fear.  The child \\"soldiers\\" are merely puppets for the adult characters to manipulate, until they bring in one child who can outwit the best of them. In the beginning, the protagonist Ender Wiggin plays the \\"game\\" exceptionally well, too well in fact for his peers to accept.  But, like all true heroes, Ender wins over some of the \\"soldiers\\" with his strong will, fierce ambition and exceptional leadership.  As expected, a few of the \\"soldiers\\" will fight Ender to the bitter end.  Eventually, the novel takes a twist and Ender begins to doubt himself and quits the \\"game.\\"  Card brings the reader in deeper as he weaves the relationship between Ender and several of the characters around feelings that are not allowed to surface.  Card takes the reader on a journey as Ender struggles with his emotions and choosing between right and wrong.  Ender wants to impress the adults and his comrades, but he does not want to play the game any longer.  Can he have it both ways and still be happy with himself?  I am anxious to see where Card takes Ender in the rest of the series.  It most certainly will not be back to the childhood that evaded the prodigy.

B00004RJ74|4.0|I love vampire movies and this is certainly one hell of a vampire movie.  This movie is just so well done it leaves me speechless, the acting is just pure fun and awesome to watch.  George Cloony makes this movie folks.  What he did on ER was great, but as a bad ... in this movie it purely blows away everything else that he's done. At least in my mind, no offense to ER, great tv show. Love it.<br />You also have Harvy Kietel and Juliette Lewis in the film, whom play a believable father daughter combo. <br />Anyway on to the film the first half of the movie deals with the Gecko bothers and how they are trying to get into mexico to avoid the authorities.  So they hook up..er..kidnap Kietel and Lewis and head for the border.  All in all its a great opening and the character interaction is pure magic.  You can pretty much see that Cloony's character is a mucho bad ... supreme, and he demands respect or disrespect or something, whatever he is demanding he asking for a heap of it.  <br />Of course the whole crew of misfits gets into mexico and goes to what I call \\"the actual bar you would find in hell.\\"  Once there some more great interaction occurs, and one hot dance later all hell breaks loose.  The movie from there is a pure joyride of action and carnage.  <br />I won't spoil anything for you, but this movie has slick and clever dialouge that will have you on the floor laughing.  It also has a great plot and pretty neat special effects.  The acting is top notch and the vampires look pretty damn ugly.  Lots of gore people, not for the faint of heart.<br />Overall the DVD is great with tons of stuff to go through, this collectors edition has the film Full Tilt Bogey included with it which is basically a hour and a half long making of documentary.  With all this you think this film could not get any better, eh wrong answer it gets better.  Robert Rodriguez director of the Faculty, and Desparado is behind the camera for this film.  <br />I think thats a lot of good reasonsto get this slick action/horror flick, but hey why believe me find out for yourself and go out and experience From Dusk Til Dawn.

B00002E233|4.0|First off I love shark films, in a word: Jaws.  But this film is something different.  The science behind the sharks and how they move and what these scientists did to them is mind bending.  Plus they actually built three huge friggin' sharks to make this film believable.<br />So what you got is a bunch of scientist and Sam Jackson (yes he is in this movie as well as a host of others) doing experiments on sharks to help cure a disease, but oops the scientists screwed with sharks and they became smart *evil laugh*.  Then sharks do the nasty on there makers and thus equals deep blue sea.<br />As you can tell the plot is a bit murky, but the acting is pretty good and the sharks look great although some of the special effects on these sharky's looks pathetic at times.  But still I found the flick to be pretty enjoyable to watch, and Thomas Jane (the main hero) does a good job as the tough Wolverine wannabee shark wrangler.  Plus its got Sam Jackson the baddest M-Fer in movies today, by the way that is self proclaimed by Jackson himself.<br />Also the DVD has some awesome extras, deleted scenes and lots of other goodies to check out.<br />Closing thoughts:  If you like shark films and good acting this is a good film to go out and buy, I really enjoyed it.  But it does get a bit hokey at parts and you'll be saying \\"What the hell was that?\\"  But still its worth at least renting first, that is if you don't like sharks.  Still has lots of great action and carnage for the typical movie lover.<br />But true believers if you enjoy sharks and love action movies and not to mention Sam Jackson being a possible Sharky treat go out and get this film.
B00005RJ1U|5.0|Or so I thought until I rented this beauty.  Definitely the creepiest I've seen since...well, I can't remember when!  This is a perfect bogeyman-as-antagonist sort of blood-curdler in the vein of &quot;Phantasm&quot; or &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;.  I won't bore you with another synopsis, since you can pick that up from many of the previous reviews, but this film is best if you don't know anything about it anyway.<br />I saw &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; on the shelf at the video store and was certain from the title that it would be a dismal attempt at a horror flick.  Nevertheless, I went to the effort of picking up the sleeve to check the reviews.  Clive Barker found this film scary?!?  Instant chill up the spine.  If this film made an impression on the virtuoso who brought us &quot;Night Breed&quot;, it has to be worthy of a viewing.<br />Sure, the usual, &quot;Why in God's name are you not running away?&quot; scenario plays repeatedly in this slick number, but the answer as always is that the movie would have been fifteen minutes long if the protagonists did a quick fade!  As it turns out, given the nature of the baddie in this one, it may not have done the kids any good to run at any point...<br />Turn the lights out, sit back, suspend your disbelief.  And DON'T watch this one with a full bladder.
B00003CX8J|5.0|How do you take the best selling comic book and turn it into something that everyone will enjoy?  Well you got yourself the best example ever in X-Men.<br />First off we all know the story, mutants, Professor X, and Wolverine.  It's all good, the fan boys have bought this film to death.  So my review is geared towards the non-fan boys.  Because they should be the only ones that do not own this film yet.<br />By the way fan boy = comic book lover.  <br />So heres the dealeo.  X-Men starts off by telling us the tragic story of how mutants and humans are having trouble coexisting, this burr is stuck between a certain senators unmentionables.  Thus creating stress between the two races.  In comes Magneto (picture villian with power to control magnetism)a mutant with a cause.  To kick all humans ....  Here enters Prof. X the good guy with mind powers and his X-Men (basically lots of mutants that help the fella out)  Plus we get treated to how these characters focus around two other mutants, Rogue and Wolverine who meet up in the Canadian outback.  The story then progesses along and well I won't tell you anymore, sorta ruins the whole movie watching process.<br />The DVD in itself is awesome with really neat interactive menus and lots of goodies to keep one entertained for awhile.  But I think they should have at least added in mutant biographies to give non-comic fans an idea of who these characters are and describe them a bit better.  All in all though..it's still super well done.  <br />The story and movie is excellent as it has a lot of action scenes to keep everyone buckled in.  Plus the acting is a pure treat to watch.  The actors in this movie really made it work.  Just a great movie to sit down and watch.<br />In closing, if your not a comic book fan and thinking \\"eh is it really worth it?\\" my answer yes it is, it is at least a must rent and a eventual must own.  Great watch and feast for the eyes, the special effects are great and nothing is done below the par level.  So go out and get this film people, what still reading this review?  Go! Shoo!<br />By the way, fan boys not having this film yet (unless of course your anti marvel) you better go out and get it. Nuff' Said.<br />Till next time true believers. Excelsior!
079073382X|5.0|Plenty of folks have already written wonderful reviews with details on story, actors, etc, so I won't add to that. Instead, I just want to say:<br />I watched Before Sunrise on video in 1997. Tonight, feeling a bit blue (who's not these days...), I was reading reviews for some of my fave flicks, and was completely blown away when I saw that there are close to 100 reviews of Before Sunrise, all but a few of them glowing: I thought I was the only person in the world who adores this movie, and wanted to jump for joy when realizing that there are many Sunrise fans out there. It gives me great hope for humanity to read how many people out there love this gem of a movie. There was even a guy who admits to liking mostly action-flicks, but even he loved Sunrise!  How cool is that?!  It's one of the most romantic movies out there and one that doesn't insult your intelligence, and it's so very different than most Hollywood romances these days. Linklater has Austrian roots, and it must have been glorious for him to shoot a movie in Vienna, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Mozart, Freud, Linklater, Hitler - well, there's always a rotten apple in the basket. <br />And by the way, don't even think of making a sequel - that would ruin everything!
0553573403|5.0|This is the first book of a fantasy epic that is based in a time and place that will seem very similar to some of England's history, particularly the Hundred Years War or the War of the Roses. The magic is very low key... no mysterious rings or happy little elves in these books. Each chapter is written from the perspective of a different character. The story unfolds as you read the different points of view, and you will find yourself identifying with characters that you started out hating and hating characters that you started out liking! There are no archetypes in these novels... every character has their own agenda and their own motivations... the characters are well developed and complex... the dialog is fantastic... the plots and subplots are delicately interwoven, and the outcomes are entirely unpredictable. The titles of Martin's books may sound contrived, but the writing is top notch. I am eagerly awaiting the fourth book in the series (due out fall 2002) called &quot;A Feast for Crows.&quot;
B000002HK4|4.0|I don't know if it's a mandatory rule in prog-rock, but it seems like any band who performs that kind of music has to write a sprawling, awesome 20+ minute epic to showcase their musicianship and imagination.  From Rush (\\"2112\\") to Yes (\\"Close to the Edge\\") to Jethro Tull (\\"Thick as a Brick\\"), almost every band in prog. has done this.  And in 1995, progressive metal giants Dream Theater put their own unique stamp on the prog. epic with the release of their 23-minute opus \\"A Change of Seasons.\\"  Personally I don't think it's their greatest song like others have mentioned, but DAMN!  It's still one hell of an epic.  Very creative and powerful with seven movements, three of them being instrumentals.<br />It all begins with the first instrumental \\"The Crimson Sunrise,\\" with a haunting guitar riff that reminded me of \\"Pull Me Under\\" and blazing Latin percussion by Mike Portnoy.  This is quickly followed by the catchy and rockin' \\"Innocence.\\"  Next up is the mostly mellow and groovy \\"Carpe Diem.\\"  This is my favorite part of the epic.  James's singing just tears into your soul and Petrucci's acoustic guitar is simple yet effective.  \\"The Darkest of Winters\\" is the second instrumental and it's also the best.  There's some jazz parts on the keyboards and bass that reminded me of Steely Dan for some reason.  The ballad \\"Another World\\" is the emotion-packed high point; \\"The Inevitable Summer\\" is a reprise instrumental; and the grand finale \\"The Crimson Sunset\\" just sends shivers up and down my spine when James sings that final lyric \\"I will live on.\\"  What a finish!  Like many prog epics, the lyrics tell a story and in this case, Portnoy's words are about an old man who is trying to come to terms with his inevitable death and how his son (and his family for that matter) will carry on his legacy.<br />After \\"ACOS,\\" the rest of the album is devoted to live cover songs that DT performed in London around that same time.  It's their own special tribute to the bands that inspired them.  For me, the first two covers are the most impressive.  Elton John's famous epic \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" is filled with more energy and intensity than the original and fits in perfectly with the album's theme of accepting death.  The cover of Deep Purple's \\"Perfect Strangers\\" shows DT's heavy metal roots and it's an awesome performance.<br />The next two covers are what bog the album down and got 1 star taken off.  The Zeppelin trilogy is great, but I think it would've been better if they covered the whole thing of \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" instead.  That would've been something.  \\"The Big Medley\\" sounds too slow and for 10 minutes that's not a good sign.  The Kansas cover is pretty damn good, though.  Overall, this is worth getting just for \\"A Change of Seasons\\" and the Elton John and Deep Purple covers.  I wouldn't start here if you're new to DT, but it's still recommended.<br />(I wish they covered a Rush song, but there's always the Internet...)
0887307396|5.0|Simply for the definition that Collins/Porras make of Core Values, this book is worth the price of admission. The formula which they repeat throughout the book (Core Values = Core Ideology + Purpose) is worth repeating more often, and something that anyone who concerns themselves with strategy should remember.<br />One of the things I think _Built to Last_ does particularly well is to not only explain what their ideas are, but to also explain what they aren't. They seem to understand the confusion possible in their ideas and take the time to anticipate, correct, and clarify. This is a rare characteristic in business writing, where the normal problem I encounter with books is that the author assumes that everyone is on the same page in more ways than one.<br />Must for people in the business of corporate strategy.

B00005QZ7U|3.0|first off..i hate musicals..with a few exceptions..(hedwig, rocky horror a few others) but i got to say this movie drew me in from the opening titles..absolutely gorgeous visuals..the first hour blew me away. when the whole evil duke..hidden love..she dying act towards the end began rolling it lost some steam..but i still think this was a great movie..remaking the contemporary songs was a little bit gimmicky..but hey it really did work..especially \\"heroes\\"...the sets, costumes, cinematography were all brilliant..i thought that this year lord of the rings was a shoo-in in the visuals dept at the oscars but now even though they are completely different styles moulin rouge might be just as good and might grab a few too..very simple plot but, made up for by the great performances...and a stunning look and feel. its nice to see some originality and someone with a vision..baz luhrman deftintely has that.<br />and the extras on the dvd are wonderful.

0517122707|5.0|This is an amazing book-- for the way it was published as well as the content. The first copy I bought ( Inow have at least 3) is nearly worn out because I kept it in my desk drawer when I was working, and when I got too stressed out, I'd just grab good ole Ignatius and very soon, the stress was all gone. There's nothing like an evening at the Night of Joy Bar to alleviate stress! My only regret is that the dumb old publishing powers that were in his day didn't latch onto this masterpiece so that Toole would still be with us. I wish I knew what happened in that car on the way to New York!
0780626966|5.0|How many people can really say they have never seen Freddy in their lifetime? Very few I believe. These films, which only got better each time, are some of the very true horror/slasher flicks that have ever been made. You have the unstoppable villian in each, one that is not so far unbelieveable, and can kill like few others. This is an excellent box set of dvd's and each film has been cleaned up and looks exceptional. A must have for any DVD collection.
B00003CXCS|5.0|THE SOUND OF MUSIC is still my favorite musical of all time. It tells the beautiful, timeless story of Maria, a young nun-in-training living, during the time of Nazis-Germany, in Austria. Maria is unlike all the other nuns because she loves nature, acts clumsy at times, and can be very noisy. The head nun of her church suggests that Maria leaves the church and work for Captain von Trapp as a governess for his seven children. At first, the children hate Maria, but learn to like her after she starts taking them out to different places and sings to them. Maria eventually wins over the love of the children and even the stern Captain von Trapp. No sooner after Captain von Trapp and Maria wed, the Nazis plan to put Captain von Trapp in jail for refusing to give them some personal information about himself! So Maria, Captain von Trapp, and the children escape Austria to hide from the Nazis so they can't take Captain von Trapp away.<br />The music is absolutely incredible and unforgettable. I have the double-tape VHS original version of the film. I rented the DVD and found this five star collection to be truly a treasure. The only let down is the fact that it's only available in widescreen format, which most DVDs are these days. I love all the musical numbers and the acting is incredible...Julie Andrews is at her best. I've never seen a Julie Andrews performance so perfect since MARRY POPPINS and THE PRINCESS DIARIES. There are tons of special features on this DVD and they are all great and fun to watch.<br />If you have not seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC yet then you truly do not know what you are missing. This is a timeless classic that should be on the shelf of every family's home DVD library!
B000002HAF|5.0|The Pixies were one of the first alternative bands to hit the scene.  Lead by Black Francis they influenced most of the alt. bands you hear now.  Songs like Bone Machine and Gigantic were big influences on bands like Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins.  If you want to know the Pixies sound it is a mix of the Smashing Pumpkins, the Cure, and Nirvana.  I would say the Pixies are one of the greastest bands from the 80's; and Surfer Rosa is a must have album for any alternative fan.
B000001FA4|5.0|Mention the band name U2, and instantly people will probably think of The Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby, and most recently All That You Can't Leave Behind, which just won 4 more Grammies.<br />As incredible as those 3 CDs are, it is this often times forgotten gem that really started my lifelong dedication to U2.<br />For those who remember what the music scene was like back in 1984-1985, it wasn't too much different than today - pop groups that are here today, then gone the next, only to show up on one of those \\"Where Are They Now\\" shows. I remember the first time I ever heard the 6 note introduction to \\"Pride\\", and I was awestruck. That's all it took to make me a lifelong fan of U2. I sensed there was something different about this band, and something told me \\"These guys are going to be around for a while...you might want to pay attention to them.\\" A divine message or a premonition? I'll let you decide that. <br />Another reviewer called this disc the link between \\"War\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\", and be right. The trademark characteristic of U2 is that no two albums ever sound alike, but they truly are pieces of work. Here's a track by track run down, with ranking.<br />\\"A Sort of Homecoming\\": 5/5 Great guitarwork by the Edge, who has constantly proved to be one of the most creative guitarists ever. Adam and Larry, as always, doing what they do best. Good vocal performance by Bono.<br />\\"Pride\\" 5/5 Again, this is the song that kindled my passion for this band by rising above the sludge of mindless pop and metal that was around when this disc was first released. Passionate lyrics about Martin Luther King who gave everything to see a world in which racism is a thing of the past. Outstanding guitarwork by the Edge, as always.<br />\\"Wire\\" 5/5 Great opening with the Edge's rhythm guitar work, but this song really belongs to Adam, with his bass line that dominates the whole song. I've heard of two different intrepretation of the lyrics to this song, but I'll leave it up to you, the listener which you think fits better. One is that it is about Jack the Ripper, or possibly about suicide. Of course, U2 has always been ambigious with their lyrics, so songs can have different meanings to different people.<br />\\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" 5/5 This song is one of the most atmospheric on the whole album, and one of the tracks that I overplayed when I first got the record. Guess that gives away my age.<br />\\"Promenade\\" 4/5 Another slow, atmospheric song, with a great vocal performance by Bono.<br />\\"4th of July\\" 3/5 Probably the only instrumental that U2 has ever done. Again, a standout peformance by Adam. I see this song as sort of a link between Promenade and Bad.<br />\\"Bad\\" 7/5 I can't say enough about this song...this is the one that brought the house down at Wimbley Stadium during Live Aid. That performance marked the beginning of U2's rise to superstardom, and global dominance in the rock world. Outstanding vocals by Bono, with some of his most passionate lyrics, which deal with heroin use in Dublin. Great performance again by Larry (especially at the end), the Edge, and Adam.<br />\\"Indian Summer Sky\\" 4/5 Probably one of the most underrated song's on the entire disc. This is another song that I played constantly. This song is among my favorites on The Unforgettable Fire. Adam, again, dominates this song, with the Edge doing what he does best, in adding color to the song with his contributions.<br />\\"Elvis Presley and America\\" 4/5 A good song, but if I recall right, it used the drum and bass tracks from \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" while Bono ad libbed the lyrics over it in just a stream of consciousness fashion.<br />\\"MLK\\" 5/5 U2 has a tradition of ending each release with a slow, thoughtful song, and TUF is no exception. This is among my favorite album closers. A passionate vocal performance by Bono, with lyrics dedicated to King. The best way, as another reviewer pointed out, to experience this song is to turn out all the lights and listen to thesong in the dark on a discman. It becomes a lot more powerful.<br />This CD will always hold a special place in my heart, as it was the spark that ignited my passion for one of the greatest rock groups ever.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a must buy for all music fans. this is one of the only CD's that ive had for more than a year, and actually still listen to. i went to the Family Values Tour 2001, and they may not have been the best performance there, but they definately came close. im sure you have heard at least one of their songs on the radio, and if you liked it, then you will like this whole CD. its great. id give all the songs 5 stars. i hope in their next CD they'll include: Part of Me, Step Up, High Voltage, My December, Carousel, and And One, which are awesome songs from their old name which was Hybrid Theory. Just buy it already. You wont be sorry.

B000002B1M|4.0|This was the first CD I've heard by Nas (I heard it around the time The Firm was in existence).  I thought this was a great CD with some nice beats and memorable lyrics.  Then later on I explored into Nas's debut album 'Illmatic' and my opinion on 'It Was Written' slowly changed...<br />After hearing Nasty Nas rippin' the mic fascinating us with his street tales on 'Illmatic', where is he going to go from there?  He goes even more into street life and adopts a thug-like persona on 'It Was Written'.  That change doesn't really hurt the release too much, but the absence of Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-tip, and Premier beats was noticed by me.  Well actually Primo did produce ONE track and it was one of the shiners.  Nas seemed to go from an ill street smart emcee to a street repping thug... Now I don't hate thug rap, but at the time there was so much violence in rap and Nas seemed to get sucked into it...<br />But nasty Nas still had some nice shiners on this LP: \\"The Meaning\\", \\"Street Dreams\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"Affirmative Action\\", \\"Black Girl Lost\\", and the '96 classic \\"If I Ruled The World\\"... which all helped this CD be an essential release for the average Nas fan...<br />It's nearly impossible to follow up a CLASSIC debut album, but 'It Was Written' is a good enough attempt.  Some production on it is very similar to 'Illmatic' and you have Nas experimenting with other beatmakers like Dr. Dre...  Overall this is a GOOD album some people are really backlashing it saying it's garbage because its not 'Illmatic part 2', but it is no where near garbage... just give it a quick listen...<br />I'm Out...Mind Power!
B00005JKYS|5.0|I could have done without the two racism lessons, it's getting pretty tiring now.  I suppose it's due to the era this film was based and I accept it for that, but they seemed really out of place to me.<br />Other than that the movie was excellent.  The action was intense and I could feel the tension really build as the movie progressed.<br />This movie showed very intense action for only a few days of time that went by and really impressed upon me the hell that many of the soldiers and pilots in Vietnam had to endure on a daily basis as they fought against Communism throughout their enlistment.<br />In all I will never forget the movie and the feelings it stirred within me.  I highly recommend seeing it!
B000001F7R|5.0|Let's get serious.  If Def Leppard sounded the same on the first album and their latest, that would be like saying that after 20 years U2 or Metallica should have the same sound.  Artists CHANGE with time.  Def Leppard is no different.  I almost threw up the first time I heard the song 'Love Bites' off Hysteria, then I realized that the mighty Lepps were changing with the times.  'Lemon' by U2 was a [dumb]song the first time I heard it too, as well as 'Unforgiven' by Metallica.  I have a new respect for bands like Def Leppard, U2, and Metallica for having the balls to change their sound.  Good job and forever live Def Leppard!!
6301966015|5.0|Ever since I first saw this movie in the late 60's, it seemed clear to me that the whole picture was not really about the veracity of the crime that the photographer supposedly shot, but rather about the unreality of the life of the mod world, and by extension of the pop world as a whole. The two different chromatic tones used by Antonioni to depict the real life, as represented by the flop house, and the illusory pop world, the main theme of the movie, are indicative of the contrasting realities portrayed in the film. Hunger, poverty, old age, diseases, and dead are painted in subdued mate tones. On the other hand, the harlequins, mimes, drugs parties, rock concerts and other happenings populated by those zombies that represent the pop culture, their unreality notwithstanding, are filmed with bright fluorescent colors. These specimens of what now is considered the \\"beautiful people\\", are empty of true emotions. And just by chance, to one of its members, the photographer, the opportunity to escape from that unreal world is offered in the form of the photographing of a murder, without meaning to. Confronted with the absolute truth, death, this superficial human being does not know how to behave. That surreal world to which he belongs has ingrained so deeply into his soul, that instead of behaving like a normal person would do by going to the police, he instead unconsciously invents as many circuitous, roundabouts ways as possible to avoid the confrontation of that most real of truths: death. So that is why, after realizing that the corpse has disappeared, he circumambulates aimlessly by the park. And when asked by the mime to return the illusory tennis ball (that is, to reinsert himself anew in the illusory mod or fashion world) he decides to comply, having lost for ever the opportunity to be a true human being. And that is why the unreal tennis ball starts to sound in the final seconds of the movie.<BR>What makes this film a classical masterpiece, besides the formaland structural techniques employed by \\"el maestro\\" Antonioni, is his depiction of the banal, sophomoric reality of the mod and pop world. And all banality of that world depicted in the film is as true today as in the 60's (just take a look at the frantic and pathetic lives of all those soulless Hollywood stars). <BR>To say that the film has not aged well just because the white jeans that Hemmings wears are today demod, is like saying that Battleship Potemkin is an anachronism because the Odessa steps scene sequence has been surpassed by Brian De Palma in The Untouchables. Simply put, classics by definition can not be dated. By the way, Blow-Up is based in a short history by Julio Cortazar(\\"Las babas del diablo\\"), and has nothing to do with the Zapruder film, whatsoever.<BR>As to some resemblance to the Austin Power movies I can not attest one way or the other, because life is too short to spend two hours seeing such stupid, silly movies (or Titanic, or Gladiator, or Shakespeare In Love, or Pearl Harbor, for that matter). <BR>The jazz score throughout the most appealing scenes and the ominous wind in the park are employed in a masterly way. If any film deserves to be edited in DVD, this is it.
B00005IC2H|2.0|Okay, let me dispel the rumors. Yes, this is a pretty record. Yes it is sweet. Yes there is more thought and craft behind it that many other current bands care to invest in their music. But I shelled out my [money] and felt REALLY burned. For one thing, the singer with his limp-wristed, whiny delivery really makes me wanna poke his eyes out. I admire the fact that he sings in his native tongue-- far too few bands from other countries have their lyrics in their own language, probably for fear that they won't break that all-important US market. Gorky's Zygotic Mynci from Wales do this too, as well as the uber-fantastic Einsturzende Neubauten, but I digress. While I do admit the musical part of the CD is often soaring and effective, it is derivative and then marred by that incessant nancy-boy emo-voice. Sounds like a sad cat on a hotplate. I say the music is derivative because-- IT IS. Sigur Ros sounds almost EXACTLY like a collision of two really fine bands-- MOGWAI and GODSPEED YOU BLACK EMPEROR. If you took those two bands and blended their membership, had them go into a studio on a bad day when they were all feeling a little too sensitive and vulnerable, then added some nasally annoying vocalist, maybe throwing in a dash of old Cocteau Twins for good measure, you would end up with Sigur Ros. Not greater than the sum of its parts, they unfortunately marry the worst of both of the bands they attempt to emulate. Perfect if you want fluffy cotton candy foo-foo la-la music. But if you want original music with heart and soul and meat of any kind on its bones (read: substance), please look elsewhere.

0380729407|4.0|Long recognized as the master of the short story and science fiction, Ray Bradbury is most at home in the October country, the land where beauty and terror walk side by side.  He ushers us into this land in his novel,\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\", and almost poetic rendering of two boys coming of age and a man dealing with his own mortality.<BR>It is October, the season between warm summer and the chill of winter, and a carnival is coming to town, blown in by the same winds that make two young boys wake in the morning hours and gaze out their windows, full of unspoken longings.  A handbill flies across the street promising a thousand and one wonders on its way to the quiet country town and a library's janitor feels the stirring of the boy he was fifty four years ago as the sound of a calliope comes closer.<BR>Too late in the year for a carnival,\\"Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show\\" arrives with something for everyone, the sweetness of cotton candy and the fascination of the freak shows, mirror mazes and merry go rounds and, master of it all is the Illustrated Man, who just might have your picture tattooed in the pal of his hand.<BR>Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade are fascinated by the secrets the carnival hides and are drawn steadily deeper into it's dark secrets and fantastic promises, but the line between the wonderful and the terrible is a thin one and it is up to Will's father to make sense of the wonders the carnival has really brought and to try to save the two boys from its' lies.<BR>Although I am not a fan of the horror genre and did not believe I would like this book, I soon became fascinated with this novel and it's beautiful imagery.  I often found myself re-reading Ray Bradbury's expertly crafted phrases which propel the reader from  this world to Bradbury's own like the magic he loves to write about.  He touches on our past experiences of sound and taste, memory and desires, hopes and fears and wraps them into a fantastic story that appeals to all ages.  This is more than a \\"horror\\" novel.,it is a life-affirming story of foolishness and bravery, wisdom and the miracles of love between a father and son, and between two friends.  Though \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" has been made into a movie, there is no substiture of Ray Bradbury's genius for description and his mastery of the English language.  He reminds us of the children we were and reassures us of the future when he writes.  This book will leave you smiling and looking at the world with eyes more attuned to the wonders around us.<BR>Oddly enough, this book has been dedicated to actor/dancer Gene Kelly whose artistry, says Bradbury, \\"changed my life\\".  This book and its sweet message will also touch lives and leave them changed.  I highly recommend the experience.
B000002AH9|5.0|vocal virtuosity has never been billie's trademarks and never before has it been more glaring than in this set. with just over a year (and one more album - for the verve label) to live, you can imagine the greatest jazz singer hang on to dear life. a superficial listen would have the novice think she's all washed up but those familiar with her story would find her interpretations nothing short of heart wrenching - check out &quot;you've changed&quot; . ray ellis's string arrangements only serve to highlight the harshness of her severely diminished range.<br />the liner notes even pushes the poignancy envelope further.
0871137380|4.0|This is one book you can't put down. Its much better than the movie and the movie had you sitting on the edge of your seat. You almost feel like you are with the D-boys and the Rangers on the streets of \\"The Mog.\\" The writing paints such a graphic picture of the events that you literally writhe in pain every time one of the soldiers gets wounded. You come away wondering though what they were doing in Somalia in the first place. The humanitarian food drive was over. The UN peacekeeppers were in place and our boys were sent on a mission that lacked good intel, support from the upper brass and the lack of desire in Washington to really make changes. In short nearly 20 lives were wasted and 98 were changed forever. One thing is for sure...we didn't learn from our mistakes...and our mistakes gave rise to the forces that brought down the Towers on 9/11. This is a great book. I just ordered \\"Killing Pablo,\\" also written by Mark Bowden.

0441172717|5.0|To write about SF is very difficult, Asimov and Clarke are perhaps the first names that come to mind.  Moreover, stories must be scientifically possible, at least a little.  I think that Dune is not very SF, and yet, it is a landmark in storytelling.  Frank Herbert conceived the best Political novels ever.  His style, unsurpassed by any other writers, should be the guideline to future writers of this kind of novels.  I have just finished Foundation, and some months ago I re-read 2001.  These are classic SF.  But Frank Herbert's Dune will always be the best political novels.  Period.

0812550706|5.0|This was a book recommended to me by a friend who also happened to tell me the ending before I read it.  Remind me to give him a nasty stare!<br />Anyway, this book starts off with a rather long introduction which the author wrote himself about his influences and motivation for writing Ender's Game.  The author has had the idea of a Battle Room since he was sixteen.  Only much later did he piece together the story of Ender and his mission to save the earth.  <br />Ender Wiggin is a special boy.  He is the youngest (6 yrs old when the story starts) of a family of child geniuses (Peter being the eldest, then Valentine).  This story is set in the future where aliens (called Buggers because of their physical and mental traits) have tried to invade the earth twice.  Twice the Earth defeated them, but at great cost.  The government is scrambling to make sure this never happens again by training the next set of star fleet commanders from childhood.<br />In this futuristic world, only the government could sanction the birth of a third child (for population control reasons).  In a way, Ender was born for a purpose.  Peter and Valentine were both tested for giftedness and they both possessed it; however, he was ruthless and evil, and she was too soft and kind.  Ender was a perfect balance of decisiveness and innocence, and so chosen from the beginning to go through Battle School.  It is in Battle School that Ender learns military strategy and the history of wars between the Earth and the Buggers.  It is also in Battle School that Ender makes friends and molds the perfect platoon leaders.<br />What's really unique about this story is that Ender is forced to grow up so quickly by the \\"adults.\\"  The teachers of the school and high government officials all have one thought in their minds.  And that is to eliminate the alien threat at all costs.  Even if it means sacrificing the health and sanity of a child.  Ender is subjected to so much isolation and abuse throughout the story,that I felt really bad for him.  He has to learn to think like an adult through the eyes of a child.  His biggest fear is becoming like his brother Peter (who, in Ender's eyes, is a cold blooded killer -- keep in mind that we're talking about the thoughts of a child who hasn't even reached puberty) is slowly becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy as he matures.  The ending of this story is just amazing.  I will not give it away!<br />I recommended this book to a 13 year old boy before having finished the book.  Now I'm thinking twice about my recommendation.  Although this book's main characters are children and centers around the premise that child geniuses will save the world, there are a lot of adult themes and references to ancient history that probably only an adult would appreciate.  I believe references to the Warsaw Pact, the League of Nations, Locke and Demosthenes will confuse the younger readers.  Also the themes of murder, deception, isolation, rules of engagement in battle might be viewed as inappropriate by parents for their kids.  With this in mind, I urge the reader to consider the maturity of the intended audience before recommending this book even though this is a terrific story.
B00005B36H|5.0|Wait, Why did I say a Disappointemnt if I gave it five stars. Simple. This CD while compared to Aenima, Opiate, and undertow, is just that. However it says  nothing bad for this CD only good things about their previous work.<br />This stands as one of my favorite Albums, From Lateralis (spelled that way becasue I have a typo'ed copy I bought the day it came out) to their scary Ticks &amp; Leeches, it is amazing.<br />This CD is awesome, but listen to their previous work first that will open your minds eye, only then will you appreciate this.<br />My third eye is open.

6305499365|5.0|Yeah... Murderously funny movie. So many very strong characters that it just couldn't fail. No surprise, with Mike (Beavis and Butthead) Judge at the helm.<br />Office Space brilliantly captures the mind-numbing tedium of repetitive code debugging projects in the run up to the December 31st, 1999 deadline. (The M Bug was a genuine problem, in that ANY computer code based on the concept that tomorrow's date must be numerically larger than any previous date WOULD fall over.)<br />While the superb Gary Cole steals the show as the intensely irritating boss Bill Lumburgh, whose coffee mug never leaves his hand (even when he is making love to Jennifer Aniston in a fantasy sequence), every member of the cast gives 1000%. <br />Rather than give away any specific details of the plot, I will just add that OS contains many sharp and witty insights into the ritual dance of modern office life, played out by the craziest collection of characters ever assembled in one movie. For that reason, it is scarily close to reality.<br />Great... Yeah...
B000021YQV|5.0|I'm not too impressed right now with the current state of hard rock. 95% of today's hard rock acts sucks because lyrically and musically they are cliched and contrived. This whole nu metal genre reminds me of when hair metal ruled the airwaves back in the early to late '80s. Then out of the sea of contrived and cliched rock bands that one rare band will stand apart from its peers with an album that shakes the foundations of hard rock. That band is System of a Down with it's latest album \\"Toxicity\\".<br />I wasn't immediately impressed with System of a Down when I first heard its first single \\"Chop Suey\\". It was all noise and no substance to me but when I heard \\"Toxicity\\", the gorgeous middle eastern melodies changed my attitude. I bought \\"Toxicity\\" through a record club so I could get more bang for my buck as opposed to paying close to $20 for one cd. I was greatly impressed with what I heard on \\"Toxicity\\". I completely hear what many critics heard and why they listed that album as one of the best releases of 2001.<br />The lyrics may lean on the left side of politics which I don't think is bad. It sure beats listening to the same ol' BS of \\"life sucks\\" from bands like Papa Roach and Slipknot. That old line is so cliched and contrived, not to mention lacks any imagination in songwriting. Musically, this album packs a real punch. Like I said before, I loved the middle eastern melodies that the band incorporated in the band's music. That and their politically-charged lyrics are what set this band apart from their peers like Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. The title track and \\"Chop Suey\\" are just two of my favorite songs on this album. \\"Prison Song\\" kicked major butt as does \\"Pyscho\\". I wish hard rock bands would follow System of a Down's suit, not the ways of Limp Bizkit, Nickelback, and Puddle of Mudd.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Sounds more like warmed over Joni Mitchell or Shawn Colvin than Billie Holiday or Nina Simone. Jazz content is almost nil, despite being on Blue Note. The cover versions are well executed and show some promise, but the originals just aren't very interesting.There's little if no change in tempo and the whole thing kind of runs together into a faceless adult contemporary / folk-pop /Fiona Apple meets Jonatha Brooke meets Jewel kind of drone. Disappointing. And oh yeah...She's probably gonna be HUGE, like Diana Krall!!
B00005QXDD|5.0|The self-titled album by the comedic duo of Jack Black and Kyle Gass is simply too hilarious. The lyrics are raunchy and by no means should be heard by impressionable youths. I was dying of laughter as I listened to the entire album. In between songs were dialogue by Jack and Kyle which are just unbelievably funny. One of my particular favorite moments of the cd is when Jack pulled the \\"Friendship Test\\" on Kyle on track #14 by saying he loves Kyle and seeing what Kyle's reaction is. That is one of the few cleaner moments of the cd. Another favorite is \\"Kyle Quit the Band\\". Kyle unleashes a barrage of obscenities which just killed me. I love \\"Wonderboy\\". The song reminds me of something that Ronnie James Dio would have sung back in his heyday with Dio. \\"Drive Thru\\" is simply too funny when Jack wants only four chicken McNuggets as opposed to six because he is watching his weight. My particular favorite moment in the track is when he orders a large soda, filled with half diet coke and the other half regular coke. Jack lists all these ridiculous tracks while Kyle orders only two items. Normally I don't go for comedy albums but \\"Tenacious D\\" proved to be one big laugh riot.
B000002699|5.0|&quot;Shhh/Peaceful&quot;....&quot;In a Silent Way/It's About That Time&quot;. Both lengthy pieces leave me breathless.... Just listen, that's all I can say.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|... \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is the most challenging, sprawling and consistently brilliant LP Prince has released in ages and I'm better for it's mere existence! I won't even insult this man's sheer genius by narrowing this down to a handful of good tracks, I'll just say that the outright jazz  explored here is a very refreshing turn of events and represents a true evolution of The Prince sound. As far as the spiritual bent of the lyrics, this is truly a man reborn and not everyone is going to get it. Spiritual reawakening in popular music is a tricky thing, but I'm glad I get to witness this transformation.
B00005O5CM|1.0|It would probably hurt quite a bit to try and think of a film that I have seen in my nineteen years of living that is comically worse and more offensive to me as a viewer for wasting my time in a more pathetic way than MGM's Legally Blonde. <BR>   I can imagine the pitch now. Some probably already-accomplished writers looking for a sure win with a predictable and contrived plot based around the seemingly humorous idea of a sweet, blonde, rich girl making it happen at Harvard law. The MGM executive probably told them to throw in a few jokes about shoes and hair coloring, add a cute dog wearing a gucci sweater, and take out the sex scene to gear it toward a wider audience...bam, they had a movie.<BR>   Don't get me wrong, I am not usually this disgusted by pointless comedies. I have actually enjoyed a number of them, Billy Madison, Wayne's World, Earth Girls are Easy, all classics in my book. I believe the secret to comedy filmmaking success is all in the writing, and for the love of God, write for an audience with an average intelligence level that surpasses third grade. The main probelem that this film has is the storyline is terribly contrived, ignoring the entire 92 minutes of the film simply to reach the last scene. The comedy in between is poorly crafted, and the jokes are barely even able to be called jokes. <BR>Take for instance a point in the movie when the main character, Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon), discovers an important detail about a witness in a murder trial for which she is interning. The witness claims to have had an affair with the defendent, who is convicted of murdering her husband, and the affair is therefore proving the defendent's discontent with her marriage. Woods discovers that the witness is homosexual after he comments on her Prada shoes, and she quickly informs the cute grad student (played by Luke Wilson) that is assissting in the case of this fact so that they may discredit the witness. This is what she tells him, get this:\\"He's gay...he knew who made my shoes...gay guys know designers, straight guys don't.\\" Okay, after I regained consciousness from this miraculuous truth of life being so plainly stated, I racked my brain for possible reasons that this premise, presented in this way, would be even remotlely humorous. I came up with nothing, but I did decide that the lack of effort on the writers' part to develop a better joke than...that...is part of the reason why this film is so poor.    First of all, the concept that comedy has brought to light in recent years that homosexual males care a great deal more about fashion than do straight males, got old around the fifth episode of Will and Grace. However, If the writers are adament about using this concept in this part of the film, the absolute LEAST they could do is present it in some sort of comedic form. Bluntly stating something in this manner is a form of comedy that can work, but in this case it failed so miserably I barely made it to the restroom in time to puke. I won't even mention the fact that this heroic discovery is hardly enough to discredit the witness testifying, as being homosexual would not exactly make having an affair with the opposite sex and impossible feat.<BR>   The fact that I realized after sitting through this film is that Hollywood in cases like these assumes a large portion of it's audience are a bunch of mindless idiots that will enjoy this low, disgraceful form of comedy and laugh at all it's horribly failed attempts at jokes. I resent that assumption, and hope that the more people that don't purchase this film after reading this review are the more lives improved in this sense. <BR>   I realized about five minutes into the film that it is impossible to slit my wrists with a DVD case. I was therefore forced to take one for the team, and immediately publish all the reasons why this film should be avoided at all costs.
B00001IVOF|5.0|From the moment the bass and drums drop on &quot;Animal Instinct&quot; you'll be hooked. There is simply no better hip-hop, hardcore, gangsta LP out there. Everything about &quot;Hell On Earth&quot; works, the symphonic, string laden production, the beats and the raw, drawling delivery of Havoc And Prodigy make for a listening experience that will leave you shook! A classic by a brilliant duo that has never been matched (by them or their peers) and stands as a  claustrophobic, violent and insular-minded masterpiece. You hear it once and it just keeps coming back to haunt you.
B000002A3T|5.0|This was such a big surprise when I bought it. I still listen to it every once and a while. I am not kidding when I say that this is the one CD I would bring on a desert Island. I especially like the instrumental songs!<br />Buy now!!!
B000001FY9|5.0|It is impossible to overestimate the impact Bob Marley and his music have had on popular culture, religion and politics. &quot;Legend&quot; is aptly titled and features 14 brilliant, life-altering grooves that will uplift, enlighten and educate. What more can I say, this is timeless music from a giant and a true genius. NO collection is complete without some Bob Marley.<br />No filler and my personal fave &quot;Jammin'&quot; never gets old! Classic.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|In the fall of 2000, 3 of my friends and I were given a tour of Danvers State Hospital by a guy who worked there in the early 80's. The entire building is boarded up with the exception of one entrance located in the machine shop area maybe 200 feet behind the main building, where the guards are on duty in a trailer. <BR>When you enter the machine shop at the very back wall there is a small opening which leads to the subtunnels. At the mouth of the subtunnels, there are 3 to choose from and then they lead 200 feet up to the main building. Once in the main building, you climb up to the basement which is where a few of the scenes were filmed in the movie. The rooms where the most dangerous patients were kept, the shock machine room (where I tripped over a rusted shock machine lying on the floor) and the file rooms much like the one where the tapes are found in this movie. <BR>The upstairs is not QUITE so creepy as light pours through the windows. The gymnasium/auditorium (where is where I went to an extras call for the movie The Proposal) is a mess.. spray painted, the floor torn up. Along the hallways, windows are smashed, the floors and ceilings have massive water damage (on the 3rd floor I opened a door to a patient room and the roof had caved into the room, thru the floor to the room on the second floor, thru that room and crashed on the floor of the room on the 1st) The directors office which was pretty much made of solid oak all the way around had moss growing on the gold colored rug.<BR>Believe me... this building is CREEPY. I was constantly looking behind me, especially in the subtunnels where you could only see about 5 ft ahead of you even with a huge mag-lite. (I wasnt too pleased when on the way out, my flashlight died and I slipped on the mud and touched the asbestos and mold covered tunnel wall to catch myself) <BR>When I heard about this movie, I rushed into Cambridge the opening weekend with 2 of my friends (one of which is a horror FANATIC) to see whatit was all about. It was, like the building itself, creepy. I was a little disappointed with the ending but the acting, the script and my love of that place made up for it. <BR>Definatly see this movie, you will begin to understand the chills I had for the 5 hours I was in Danvers State Hospital exploring. And if you ever get the chance, get inside with a tour guide (as you WILL get lost) before they tear the building down to make a hotel. Pay your respects to the patients in the unmarked graves down the hill as well and your tour will probably go a lot more smoothly.
0375707972|5.0|This is an amazing book about Post-War Germany and the guilt of the &quot;second generation.&quot;   It starts as a love story, but ends as a thought-provoking tradegy.  Well written as well.
0345413377|5.0|Like the last two books of Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy, The Amber Spyglass is yet another breath-taking novel.   Not only was I not able to set the book down, I found myself living the book out in my mind as if I was one of the characters.  The one thing that still amazes me is how The Amber's Spyglass is able to combine reality with fantasy, love with hate, and truth with lies. <br /> The storyline started way back in the first book, The Golden Compass, 0with Lyra running away from her mother and father in order to find her piece of the world.  Not knowing the dangers that would lie ahead of her if she did.  And in the second book, The Subtle Knife, she meets a young man by the name of Will which she will slowly come to realize is the only place where she would ever be able to find peace.  With all this said, in the third and last book, Lyra learns her final lesson: there is more to everything that just the outer appearance.  Coming from a world in which she is able to see and talk to her inner self or else known to us as soul, she is slow to learn that what she sees isn't necessarily what others might see.  But through the many different experiences with Will and the different worlds, she begins to understand the importance of trying seeing the world through someone else's and perception.  At one point of the book Lyra even leaves a part of her behind to help her see another world. <br /> Some might disagree with me in saying that this book was rushed and not as good as the two proceeding it, but there is no way anyone could ever convince me that, because how can I say that this is a great \\"trilogy\\" without a good concluding third novel?  I believe it takes more than just skill to combine so many elements all into three books.  It takes the understanding of human nature, the natural world, and everything around us to be able to grasp the reader's into the fantasy world so unknown to the human brain.  Others might say that The Amber Spyglass is very much like The Chronicles of Narnia, but unless one has actually read the book, this is simply an understatement.   To me the book doesn't merely base it's plot on the theology of the bible but rather the truths of life.  Phillip Pullman to me portrays Lyra as someone about our own age, caught in a dilemma not knowing if we should take the first steps out into adulthood or stay behind in our childhood.  We end up trying to do both at the same time, going out trying to find that \\"balance\\" or \\"piece of our own world\\" on our own but not wanting to take on the responsibilities that comes with it.  To me, even till this day I find myself in the same situation as Lyra, but like her, I've also learned that through all this, only love and friendship can help us lessen and ease the pain.
0553106635|5.0|Read this.  This is a superb fantasy series, outshining any I've read for years.<br />Complex characters and a host of politics, intrigue, battle and a well-drawn world make this a real winner.<br />Normally, I'd disregard what I just wrote as a publisher's blurb, but I really can't recommend this too highly to hard-core fantasy fans.
B0000508U6|5.0|Wow!!! Coldplay has captured me with their moody yet inspirational music. I have to admit when 'Yellow' came out, I didn't like it that much. I didn't know why everyone was making such a big deal out of it. Yet something was telling me to buy the album. It was probably the fact that I really like Travis and Radiohead. Everyone compares these groups to eachother, but I personally think they all have their own distinct sound. When I got the album and listened to it, I absolutely fell in love with it. Every song is perfect. I even got used to 'Yellow'. The songs are uplifting yet they have a sort of deep depressing sound to them. I mean, you can't get more uplifting than 'we live in a beautiful world'. I can definately hear the Jeff Buckley in Chris Martin's voice, especially in 'Shiver'. I think one of the most amazing songs on this album is 'Trouble', with that beautiful piano tune in it. My only complaint for this album is there could have been a couple more songs. I really didn't want this album to end. Well I guess I have their next album to look forward to. Can't wait!!!
0060975768|5.0|As casualties begin to mount in America's \\"War on Terrorism,\\" the American public is being reminded of the true color of freedom, the color red for the blood of her men and women who go into harm's way to defend the freedoms we all take for granted.  Past battles and wars still linger in our minds, but few of us try to remember the full story of war.  We linger on the valor and courage while forgetting the pain and anguish.  We hold on to the thought that those men and women who died in battle died with full knowledge of their demise when, although they knew the risks, they had full intentions of returning to their mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children.  It is important for us as Americans to remember the brutal facts of war when examining the honor the men and women who died on the battlefield showed us in their final moments before dying in defense of the ideals of our country.  It is a great treasure when we can find a person or persons willing to tell the stories of those who died with an honesty that allows us to catch a glimpse of what these soldiers were going through so that we may begin to understand the true sacrifices of the men and women of our armed forces.  The book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young, co-authored by retired Lieutenant General Hal Moore and journalist Joseph Galloway, is such a treasure.  In the book, we see the devotion of the men under the then Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore as they fought to defend the lines assigned to their platoons.  We see the bravery and selfless devotion of the soldiers as they fought not for the politicians in Washington or the American people back home who were still unaware of the challenge that lay ahead in Vietnam.  Rather, these men fought for each other.
0767803434|5.0|This is definitely one of the good ol' us vs. them - good vs. evil story.  Harrison Ford plays a different kind of US President (one that I would like to see in \\"real\\" life), a President that takes matters into his own hands and deals his own \\"justice\\" by kicking some serious ... and shooting the heck out of everything.  Good action movie, great for a 4th of July party...
B00005Y228|5.0|This album is amazing! I first started getting into Kylie with her previous release &quot;Light Years&quot; (not released in the USA) and since then I've been listening to a lot of her music. This album is pure magic! It's just what we need here in America. A combo of disco, pop, and house beats combine to make one infectous album! Kylie wrote a bunch of the songs on here too, which is also very cool. I really hope that everyone gives this CD a chance, its not one to pass up. Worth every penny!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Not only is this movie one of the best musicals I have ever seen, but the cd makes the movie so much better.  Lady Marmalade is just the tip of the iceberg.  Nicole Kidman's voice is beautiful (who knew?) and Ewan McGreggor's is equally strong.  I listen to this cd while exercising, cooking, cleaning...I just love all the songs.  It inspires me to move my [rear]!
B0000028RR|5.0|The best Rage albumn and the true origin of rap-metal. The lyrics are weak, but it has the best bass of any of the albums, and less bizarre, experimental guitar. All of the tracks good, but &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; and &quot;Bombtrack&quot; are the best. Anyone who hates modern Metal should pick this up and be converted.
B00005Y23E|5.0|The basics :<BR>1. Remastered sound quality is excellent.<BR>2. CD 1 : 2 additional tracks : &quot;Easy Skanking&quot; and &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot;. Worthwhile.<BR>3. CD 1 : &quot;Exodus&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot; are now the longer LP versions rather than the edited singles. Good move.<BR>4. CD 2 : Extended remixes from 1980's 12-inch singles. generally excellent with a few duds (&quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; ala disco).<BR>Summary : A significant upgrade from an already-excellent release. A worthwhile purchase even if you already own the first CD.
B000002WEH|5.0|This is the most wonderful, fully realized and sustained music Elvis Presley ever did. Much as anyone should love and admire the Sun Sessions, this music here cuts straighter to the bone. It is a perfectly sequenced album of songs delivered with the most powerful, heartfelt emotion Elvis ever presented in a secular setting. 100 years from now, what will survive of Elvis's music will largely be the Sun Sessions, his gospel recordings, and this album.<br />You can get all this music on a 2-CD set called Suspicious Minds, which documents all the Jan.-Feb. 1969 Chips Moman recording sessions the produced this album, plus the great singles Suspicious Minds, Don't Cry Daddy, Mama Liked the Roses and Kentucky Rain. There are some other good cuts on it, too, like Without Love, Inherit the Wind and Stranger in My Own Home Town. So, if you're a big big fan, go ahead, spend the 30 bucks and get that one.<br />But I want to make the case for THIS disc. Because when you hear Suspicious Minds, you realize that the producer picked the true gems from those sessions, only leaving out the singles. I would argue you can get the singles elsewhere on best-of collections that any Elvis fan would have. And there is something to be said for having a CD that only has the original programming, and doesn't dilute its impact. Believe, this album has major impact as Elvis' major statement on the travails of love and life.<br />Wearin' That Loved on Look--Great, funky opening, but a disquieting scenario--sort of the flip side of Suspicious Minds.<br />Only the Strong Survive--The first hold-your-breath moment. This was a great single for Jerry Butler, but Elvis just blows him away. Look at it as a 1969 update on Elvis' early melding of R&B with country. Every moment is perfect, especially the vocal.<br />I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms)-- Oh man, what a vocal. Recalls \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\"<br />Long Black Limousine -- The next jaw-dropper. A song filled with anger and pity, thinking about an old girlfriend or friend whose big dreams came crashing down. This is the album's greatest performance, and that's saying something.<br />It Keeps Right on A-Hurtin' -- I love this version of the country classic, and it's got the most marvelous arrangement. Maybe my favorite song on it, just because its warmth and momentum.<br />I'm Movin' On-- Closed side one of the original, a gospel rave-up.<br />Power of My Love -- And it's powerful indeed. He gets a big, funky sound here.<br />Gentle on My Mind-- I can't say it tops the Glenn Campbell original, but it's a lovely version.<br />After Loving You -- Another great vocal performance on another great 50s'-style tune.<br />True Love Travels on a Gravel Road-- Great moment #4. It sounds like a tribute to a constant wife, but I can't help but think it's really a song of yearning, of a man who wishes for this kind of faithful loyalty, but isn't quite sure. Nick Lowe does a version that brings out this subtext on \\"The Impossible Bird.\\"<br />Any Day Now -- Great moment #5. More yearning, kind of like the Beach Boys' When I Grow Up (lyrically, I mean). Smooth and so evocative.<br />In the Ghetto -- It's dated as hell, and it doesn't matter. Great moment #6. Elvis sings the song with evident compassion; this is a real young man he's singing about, not a social stereotype, and his conviction makes the song work, plus the performance of the band, brilliant throughout, is beautifully understated here, making lots of room for the strings.<br />I love this album as much as any album I've heard. It doesn't get the recognition it deserves, despite Amazon's \\"Essential\\" listing. And it bothers me that the songs are now being repackaged merely at the outcome of the Memphis Sessions. It would be like if George Martin repackaged all the Beatles songs from 1967 as The Psychedelic Sessions, instead of Sgt. Pepper. Just trust me, get and play this record for what it is, and if you love it, you'll want the Suspicious Minds set just to feed your fanaticism.ious Minds set just to feed your fanaticism.
B00005JCA9|3.0|This is a great Saturday afternoon movie, but the ending was so badly ripped off the 1953 film Roman Holiday.  Despite this amazingly obvious stunt, Julia Roberts shines once again, with Grant dithering around her. While Notting Hill is much funnier than Roman Holiday, Roman Holiday is a much more moving and romantic story (I think);  I almost cried and for a 32 year old bloke who normally enjoys action and sci-fi, that's saying something.
0380973650|5.0|I've been Neil Gaiman's fan for years.I firmly believe that the sandman series are the greatest achievement of the graphic novel genre and the most sofisticated by far.This book illustrates the innerworkings of a brilliant mind loaded with an incredible ammount of information,that most would find useless.Yet,if you like world's mythology,road trips and just a great great story with terrific characters,this is the book for you.<br />I will not give a summary of the story,you can get that from reading a dust jacket cover.This is not in any way a light reading,it has a good pace,but it's not exactly a pageturner.It is the most accomplished and sofisticated novel to day by one of the best contemporary writers(for my money anyway),it is intelligent,off-beatly humored and is a must for any fan and a great introduction for the future ones.<br />So,buy it,read it and discover the mesmorizingly distorted world of American Gods by an always brilliant Neil Gaiman.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I work in a video store. Day in and Day out i am subjected to the mindless types of movies people want and the opinions on movies by these assuming [people]. I have found that the average man hates American Beauty because it says somehting they dont like to hear. Epicurean views are strongly condemned by the common place W.A.S.P.s that pollute America. No, this is not a bad film at all. One woman told me in the same breath that she loved \\"Meet The Parents\\" and Hated \\"American Beauty\\". She claimed it was \\"shallow\\", \\"impossible\\", and \\"ridiculous\\". She also said(exact quote, i wrote this down) \\"That kindo f crap doesn't happen in America\\". This kind of ignorance is what the movie is about. If you fall into a thoughtless stasis then life will pass you by, and life is short. Don't let the morality police keep you from watching a good movie.
B00003CXMG|5.0|When's the last time you saw a coming-of-age movie that wasn't filled with melodramatic teenage-angst?  There was alot of hype about this autobiographical film when it came out  and it's always scary when the critics become so enchanted with a project that they're falling all over themselves about it. But this really was the feel-good movie of 2000 and luckily it escapes that sticky-syrupy feeling by being true to its two main characters:  the music and the teenager.  The spirit of 70's rock 'n roll is as much the focus here as is the young writer who becomes enthralled by it.  Crowe recreates the 70's music scene with loving attention, but doesn't play it over the top.  It's just loud enough to capture its allure.  <br />The movie centers on William Miller (played by Patrick Fugit) a 15 year old rock 'n roll fan and music critic who lands the break of a lifetime: a cover story for Rolling Stone.  That his mother lets him go on tour with the band \\"Stillwater\\" to get his story is surprising enough (she thinks rock n roll is evil and that all musicians are on drugs). But he promises to call twice a day and be back before high school graduation and so a deal is struck. Grounding William in a home where he's still just a teenager, with a mother (another amazing performance by Frances McDormand of Fargo fame) who keeps reminding him to \\"don't take drugs,\\" sets up the juxtaposition William is walking into: the delirious world of sex and drugs and rock 'n roll.  Fugit, in his first role, plays William with an honesty that is essential to the character's success.  He's wide-eyed and curious and completely star-struck.<br />As the story progresses, William becomes more and more a part of the scene and less of an outsider looking in.  He never completely joins the party, but he's no longer awed by it either.  As teenagers will do, he idolizes Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup -- who gives such an easy-going performance that he makes it look simple) and considers him and the band his friends.  Creem editor and music critic Lester Bangs (played with cynical humor by Philip Seymour Hoffman), makes several appearances as the young critic's mentor, warning him early on to be neutral (\\"these people are not your friends\\"). But William, just a kid, can't help but get pulled in.<br />Also capturing William's attention is the beautiful Penny Lane, a Stillwater groupie and Russell's on-the-road lover, played by Kate Hudson.  Hudson's performance is stunning; the camera loves her and she's given plenty of screen time to shine in its spotlight. She gives Lane a softness and vulnerability without losing the character's edge.  Lane befriends William and he falls in love with her. Fugit shows us this growing love with right-on twinges of jealousy in his facial expressions.  He's subtle and effective. In fact, his face gives away most of what his character is feeling all of the time, often in the absence of words or actions to help tell his story. <br />Having lost all objectivity, not to mention his childhood innocence, William is now faced with several dilemmas: he's in love with the band leader's girl, and he wants to write his story without feeling that he's sold out his \\"friends.\\"  This is where the movie starts to turn.  From here on the story unfolds more quickly than slowly, but it's paced well enough where it doesn't feel at all rushed.  We're proud of William at the end.  And it's obvious that Crowe is too.<br />Of course, no film is ever perfect and this one is no exception.  There are two weak links in this movie.  One is William's sister, Anita, played by Zooey Deschanel.  Anita is a marginal character who doesn't quite work.  She's a rebelious teen who moves out when she turns 18 to live with her boyfriend, and who decides to become a stewardess. She's a little too stereotypical and Deschanel doesn't seem to be able to give her the right turn.  We know very little about Anita, and we don't seem to care either way.  Her story just isn't very satisfying. <br />The movie's ending is also a bit of a disappoitment.  Crowe found it necessary to tie up every storyline so tidily that it gives the movie's successs a bit of a jerk in the wrong direction.  It's just too pat, and borders on that syrupiness he's managed for two hours to avoid.  Still, it's a minor point in a movie that does so much so well.
B00005BCPC|4.0|O.K.  I'll admit it.  I've never read any Jane Austen.  I did see a video of Sense and Sensibility though and loved it.  I expected to love this too.  I didn't.  I wanted to identify with the young heroine, Fanny Price, a poor relation of a wealthy family living in Mansfield Park, who comes to live with them at the age of 10.  Perhaps its because the young girl seems a little too modern for her background or that the production tries too hard to be politically correct, but I just couldn't care about the characters in spite of the twists and turns of the plot.  From reading other reviews I understand that the screenwriter strayed far away from the original book. That might have been one of the problems, which I didn't realize at the time. The acting was good and so was the cinematography, but I can only give this video a lukewarm recommendation.
B000005ALN|4.0|When George Michael followed up 1987's blockbuster FAITH with the more serious-minded LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE, VOL. 1 in 1990, most of his fans were confused. No obvious singles & the album's main hit, \\"Freedom 90\\", was a vicious indictment of his old teen idol persona & the media's penchant for exploiting celebrities & all their flaws. George took his war on the music industry further by refusing to appear in the video for the song. 6 years of legal battles to get released from his contract at Columbia Records preceded George's follow-up to PREJUDICE, 1996's OLDER.<br /><br />In case people hadn't gotten the point behind the serious approach on LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE, OLDER had George digging even deeper into his emotions for the music. Also, the death of his lover contributed to the album being even more downbeat than its predecessor. While occasionally, it's a bit overwrought, OLDER still is an album that deserved a much better response on its release & should have proven George Michael's coming of age once & for all.<br /><br />When I heard \\"Jesus To A Child\\" for the first time, I was surprised to see that it was George Michael, who I hadn't heard from in years. The song was one of the most beautiful things I had heard in my life & it still is. For 7 minutes almost, George grabs the listener with a quietly Latin-based song to which even the lyrics will have listeners weeping at their beauty. Boldly released as the first single, \\"Jesus To A Child\\" did manage to make the top 10.<br /><br />Sure enough, ballads & mid-tempo songs are the main focus on OLDER, the turmoil in George's personal life causing him to reflect on what he had & what he lost. The title track, \\"It Doesn't Really Matter\\", \\"To Be Forgiven\\", \\"Move On\\" & the hopeful \\"You Have Been Loved\\" are the perfect songs to listen to either when you've broken up with a lover or lost them to illness, like George did.<br /><br />The closest thing to something truly uptempo on OLDER is \\"Fastlove\\". Another song that managed a top 10 chart placing, this song proved to George's old fans that he can still create a killer dance track, especially with Patrice Rushen's ubiquitous \\"Forget Me Nots\\" sampled (but not properly credited) in the background. \\"Star People\\" (another dirty glance at the trappings of stardom), the lamenting \\"Spinning The Wheel\\" & the exotic \\"The Strangest Thing\\" (later reprised on the closing instrumental \\"Free\\") are fairly danceable, but not on the floor-filling level of \\"Fastlove\\".<br /><br />OLDER was George's return to the music business after 6 years of behind-the-scenes grappling with his record company. While his intention on being taken seriously may still yet to be accepted, OLDER shows that George Michael certainly showed more potential than his days in Wham! would have people believe. Even with 2 top 10 hits & a club hit with \\"Star People\\", OLDER still didn't sell as many copies as LISTEN WITHOUT PREJUDICE, let alone FAITH. But with rumors of a new album due out this year (the exact date is still uncertain), an album like OLDER will be proof that George's teen idol past is a distant memory to him & that the public should probably do the same. He's certainly grown older, why can't his fans do it, too?that managed a top 10 chart placing, this song proved to George's old fans that he can still create a killer dance track, especially with Patrice Rushen's ubiquitous \\"Forget Me Nots\\" sampled (but not properly credited) in the background. \\"Star People\\" (another dirty glance at the trappings of stardom), the lamenting \\"Spinning The Wheel\\" & the exotic \\"The Strangest Thing\\" (later reprised on the closing instrumental \\"Free\\") are fairly danceable, but not on the floor-filling level of \\"Fastlove\\".<br /><br />OLDER was George's return to the music business after 6 years of behind-the-scenes grappling with his record company.

B00005JKYS|5.0|This movie couldn't get any better.  It has well placed humor, gut wrenching war scenes, and depicts the horror and stark terror these guys went through to a t.  Whether you believe the Viet Nam war was right or wrong, and whether these men believed the war was right or wrong....they fought it and fought it bravely.  They were true hero's.....and they make me proud to be an American.

These books are the best ever. they are also pretty easy to follow. they are also beutifully written It almost makes you feel like you were there with Frodo! i am 13 and i have read them twice!!! I am a True tolken fan. In fact i just bought the silmarillion.............
B00000ILBK|5.0|Originally this Piller written story as a variation on &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; where Data goes off the deep end and Picard has to find him. Well, I wish I could have read the original script for this one. Sure it plays like a TV episode but it is still entertaining. No blockbuster but it is a good Trek movie. I love the scenes with the &quot;Riker Maneuver&quot; where he drops the &quot;warp core&quot; on the enemy ships. It was more balanced than Generations. This movie had a message about not fighting the aging process and it comes off quite well. You have to remember that Trek is not supposed to be cutting edge Matrix type movie entertainment. I believe Rick Berman the producer and Jonathan Frakes can't be faulted. They turned out a film you can take your family to. It was a good solid movie.

6305127638|5.0|One of the best Next Gen Movies to hit the Silver Screen; this one takes the mystery of the Borg a step further. The producers throw out the hive mind concept and introduce the Borg Queen. It's Trek like it should be. Not all the actors get equal screen time but it a rollercoster ride from start to finish.  If you like the galactic space battle scenes this one is for you.
0553296981|5.0|The diary of this young Jewish girl was about how her and her family had to hide out during the Holocaust when the Nazis were in power.  Her story depicts how they had to flee their home in Holland and reside in Amsterdam, in an old run down office building attic.  During the two years of their hiding Anne explains how their were only certain hours in which they could move around, the effects of constant boredom and starvation.  The little girls story explains how scary her life was, because her and her family were in constant fear of being found and brought to their death at the concentration camps.  The end of the book states that a few years later Annes father (the only survivor) went back to the attic where he and his family hid for so long before they were discovered and brought to the concentration camps.  He discovered the journal that his daughter had kept while looking around the gloomy area.<br /> I liked this book very much.  The fact that the little girl vividly explained her life during this time allows the readers to truly understand.  I found this story to be very emotional with added to the understanding someone can take from it.  The young readers can look into the eyes of someone their own age and that way have a better grasp of her life occurrences.<br /> I am glad that the father chose to publish the diary.  With him doing so he allows the world to see what truly happened and what horror the Jewish community was in.  This little girls journal shares the hardships as well as the courage needed to overcome the terrible obstacle that the people of this time faced.
6304082428|5.0|Every time I watch this program I notice some detail or nuance that I hadn't noticed before.  The director and producer are clearly as much in love with this story as we all are. I could go on for days on how much I love this book, these characters, the actors that play them, and the general euphoria I have when I watch this delightful mini-series....but I won't.  I have the set of VHS tapes (bought before the joys of our new DVD player) but couldn't resist buying the DVD too.  And I am GLAD that I did.  The colors were rich and the special featurette, while disappointingly lacking any Colin Firth, was very interesting.  Another thing I love about DVDs is the option to chose what chapter to view.  That way I can watch my favorite scenes over and over again!  Please buy this DVD, you will not be sorry.
B0000214F3|5.0|Three hours.  Was it too long?  Not at all.  When you think about it, what would you leave out?  Nothing.  Each piece of the plot, every scene is a gentle step to the next.  I LOVED it and would love to see it again.  It's a great story that doesn't need special effects or explosions to support it.  The acting was good.  Brad Pitt was at his best.  He was gorgeous, funny, romantic, and dashing.  I highly recommend this film.

B00005RYLE|1.0|This was the word \\"Psycho\\" author Robert Bloch used for those who would watch this type of film.  Having seen people's reaction to this movie, I have to agree.<br />This is a sick film, designed to be such... to gross-out and create fear... not humor.  The problem with the movie is that it appears to have been made sadistically.  Rather than just show gore, the camera focuses on the violence longer than needed, as if this was pornography---indeed, this appears to be a motion picture for those who wish to be stimulated not by sex, but by suffering.<br />There seems to be two types of reaction to the film--disgust and fear (normal people); humor and pleasure (people with a blood lust).<br />The film received an \\"X\\" rating but withdrew this.  Later, in 1994, the MPAA awared it an \\"NC-17\\".  It well earns this rating.  A film enjoyed by psychopathic minds.

B00003CXXP|3.0|Although Spieldberg was trying to honor Kubrick's wishes, I think this movie could have best been served on three different plates.  There were just way too many stories thrown at you all at once with characters that seem to serve no purpose what-so-ever.  I am a die hard Spieldberg fan and this was definite miss to me.  The Special Effects were typical Spieldberg (hince the three stars) but the story had too many holes that could have been filled with sequels.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie was excellent, that's all you can say really. I liked it so much that I saw it 8 times in the theater! ... I don't think they could have picked better actors and actresses to portray the characters<br />Everything from that to the scenery was wonderful. The Quidditch scene is amazing because it is exactly what I had envisoned when<br />reading the book. A must see and a must buy movie. I rate it 10 stars...even though you can't.  I have already pre-ordered my copy, how about you??

B00005QK3W|3.0|Once again, McCartney promotes a new CD the wrong way. And once again he chooses the wrong song to be the first single off of the CD. &quot;From a Lover to a friend&quot; is simply unfocused and incomplete. Not to mention about as uncommercial a song as McCartney can write. Nobody will play this on the radio, and in fact, nobody has! That is a big reason why the album has not sold. &quot;Lonely Road&quot; or &quot;Driving Rain&quot; would have made a much better choice but its too late now.  Many of the other songs on the album fall short. &quot;I Do&quot; (you've heard this one before) &quot;She's Giving Up Talking&quot; (an attempt at experimenting with new sounds that fails miserably) &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; (McCartney trying to sound like Neil Young) and &quot;Heather&quot; (a slight tune that probably took him oh. about 5 minutes to write).

1883217040|5.0|Quite brilliant. As the title states, it's very easy to read, and each new page introduces a new idea. Thus, it's concise. I have learned a fair amount of Jazz from it already, and I'm only on page 35. I can't wait to see what else it has in store for me, but the contents appear as though the book teaches _everything_ that's possible to teach. (Naturally, much about music is unteachable)
B00003CWTH|5.0|It's hard to know where to begin with 'Magnolia', the Paul Thomas Anderson modern classic.  Basically it's a sprawling drama which takes place over one day and looks at a variety of different characters that are in some slight way linked to one another.  Yes this is one of those movies, obviously inspired by Robert Altman, that takes a look at 'life' and what changes it.  Although each story is linked there are three main stories which the cast centre around.  Firstly there's a dying man (Robards), secondly there's the participants of a game show and lastly there's a police officer and a drug addict.<br />It starts off incredibly well, explaining what exactly effects our lives, be it coincidence, chance or divine intervention.  Then the movie glides in and out of these people's lives, which seem to be falling apart as they wonder where things all went wrong and how to get back on track.  Although at parts this can be sad and depressing and the movie as a whole could easily be called pretentious in its efforts to contain the meaning of life in three hours.  Yet it's so gloriously entertaining, moving and beautifully acted that it definitely stands out as one of the best movies of recent years.  Being a series of vignettes every watcher is bound to find some stories more interesting than others but as a whole this is really a superb piece of cinema.<br />Even in their relatively small roles the actors are absolutely superb.  The three that really do impress thought are Julianne Moore as a woman on the edge, Jason Robards as a dying man and Tom Cruise playing what is undoubtedly his best role as a insprirational speaker.  To anyone who thought that Cruise was just a pretty face, 'Magnolia' shows that he is not only capable of being a great comedic actor but also one that can really emote.<br />The soundtrack is almost completely made up of Aimee Mann tracks, which Paul Thomas Anderson even claims to have based the movie on.  Listening to the tracks this certainly makessense, with Mann's tracks at times giving things a lighter tone and at times suggesting the emotional trauma that the characters are going through.  Indeed, what is one of the film's best points is that it does have a number of small characters that are genuinely funny and help stop it all getting bogged down in its serious tone.<br />This is one movie that is absolutely gorgeous and extremely involving, although probably not to everyone's taste, especially if you are offended by bad language.
B00005A1PR|5.0|When politics is involve with any organization, unfairness dominates.  India was truly cheated out of a Grammy.  I like Alicia Keys but her album does not compare to India.  India beat, lyrics and voice are powerful and sensational.  When so opened for Sade (my favorite artist) she was magnificate.  <br />I strongly recommend her album.
B000002UA0|4.0|\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\"--Pink Floyd's wonderous debut album--is an essential item of its genre. Though it is certainly one of my least favorites, I cannot deny its importance to the legacy of Pink Floyd.<br />The first and only Pink Floyd record under the principle songwriting of former frontman Syd Barrett, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" boasts material that is thought-provoking, floating in childlike fantasy, and soaring in psychedelic pop. Syd Barrett's works are utterly simplistic, yet they possess a musical world of their own.<br />Probably some of Barrett's last works before his drug-induced mental decline, this is also some of Pink Floyd's only music that lived in two worlds--the world of bubble gum pop, and of psychedelic wonder.<br />Although it becomes predictable and loses its luster very quickly, Barrett's lyrics and music of fantasy and childlike wonder boast simple meters and rhythms, but suddenly change tune and pattern, wonderful in their own right. Songs about siamese cats, bedtime stories, gnomes, and scarecrows contradict the psychedelic oddities found in unintentional \\"masterpieces\\" about stars, bikes, and Asian philosophy.<br />\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is unintentionally brilliant, foreshadowing Pink Floyd's habit of making their own rules. Barrett's experimentation is unexplainable, yet undeniable at the same time. Its contradiction to later monster-albums as \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Animals\\" holds a strong, essential feature to the lexicon of Pink Floyd.
B00005K9OX|4.0|DIE HARD remains one of the best action films of the last twenty years because, unlike so many of the Schwarzenneger, Stallone, and Segal pics, this film actually has a great deal of tension, suspense, and even terror. It has, of course, the requisite violence and blooshed, but at no time does it ever succumb to the kind of gratuitous hyper-violence we've grown accustomed to in the testosterone action genre.<br />Bruce Willis became a star here as New York cop John McClane, out on Christmas sabbatical to see his wife (Bonnie Bedelia), from whom he has been estranged for six months. Clearly, they are at odds with one another, what with Willis' line of work and Bedelia's need for independence, being as she is an executive at the Nakatomi Plaza in West L.A., where they reunite. Willis berates himself for not being more sympathetic to Bedelia's desires, and waits in her office while the Nakatomi Christmas party goes on.<br />But when a heavily armed band of terrorists, led by a suave German (Alan Rickman), seize the building and everyone at the party for the purposes of stealing the $640 million in negotiable bearer bonds from the company's computer-controlled vault, Willis is forced into a life-or-death situation.  Escaping detection, he finds and kills Rickman's associates one by one, all the while as the LAPD and the FBI mistake him for one of the terrorists.  The vault's computer codes are broken and Rickman gets his hands on the money.  But eventually, Willis catches up with him and, in a showdonw that pays homage to the 1952 western classic HIGH NOON, shoots and kills Rickman and saves Bedelia.<br />I have only ever had one major complaint with DIE HARD, and it has nothing to do with the violence or the language (though the 'R' rating is obviously there for a reason). In trying to make Willis THE hero of the piece, the screenplay by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. DeSouza (based on Roderick Thorp's 1979 book \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\") makes the LAPD captain (Paul Gleason)into an incompetent, trigger-happy buffoon and the FBI men, led by Robert Davi, into a gang of trigger-happy psychopaths who seem far worse than Rickman's companions. Aside from slowing the film down to an extent, these depictions of law enforcement are rather distasteful and grossly inaccurate.<br />That complaint aside, however, DIE HARD is very skillfully directed by John McTiernan, who doesn't stint with the suspense and keeps things moving in this 132 minute-long film. Willis is at his best here, as is Bedelia, who makes for a far better than average heroine. VelJohnson's performance is also quite commendable.<br />Finally, no action film can expect to be truly memorable unless the villain is every bit the match for the hero. Few action films understand this, resulting in villains who are basically straw dummies. Not so with Rickman, whose performance as Hans Gruber makes for one of the most compelling and crafty villains the cinema has ever had.<br />Boosted by Richard Edlund's great special effects work and a high-tension orchestral score by Michael Kamen (plus an uncredited use of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony), DIE HARD, while not exactly an unflawed film, is far superior to just about everything else the action genre had to offer in the 80s and, with a few exceptions, has had to offer since then.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I like Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGreggor, and John Leguzaimo, but I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes of this music video. I guess you could call it a musical, but Richard Rogers must be positively spinning in his grave.
B00004TLMC|5.0|Stanley Kubrick was never known for a being a director whose films instantly catered to the masses.  Even popular films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and THE SHINING generated tons and tons of controversy over their meaning, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE shocked people with its elliptical approach to violence.  Kubrick's last film, EYES WIDE SHUT, released three and a half months after his untimely death in 1999, held true to form.  There is no unanimity.  In my opinion, however, this kind of debate makes for a great film.  On that score alone, that makes EYES WIDE SHUT a masterpiece.<br />Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman star in this disturbing psychosexual drama about an upscale Manhattan couple--Kidman a typical housewife, Cruise a good doctor--who become torn over conflicting views of love and sex after Kidman spots her husband playing up to a pair of models at a party held by a good friend (Sydney Pollack).  And when Cruise is called out late one night to comfort the wife of a client who has just died, he will soon find out not only how thin the line between men and women really is, but also how blurry the difference is between dreams and reality...<br /><br />Collaborating on the screenplay with Frederick Raphael, which was inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 1920s novel \\"Traumnovelle\\", Kubrick turns and twists EYES WIDE SHUT into something extraordinarily complex, something that cannot be understood with just one simple viewing.  Like all of his films before it, EYES WIDE SHUT must be seen more than once to get the full impact.  Even then, it is extremely ambiguous and deceptive, forcing the viewer to analyze in his or her mind what the exact nature of dreams really are.<br />This kind of ambiguity and the very fluid shots and Kubrick's handling of the dialogue, much closer in tone to the way real people talk, makes for a film that is incredibly long (at 159 minutes) and, for some rather boring.  But Kubrick's films have never been typical Hollywood fare anyway, and in fact have often been hugely influential on other directors (Spielberg, DePalma, Scorsese, etc.).  In the end, EYES WIDE SHUT was a typical way for Kubrick to depart this world--to leave us with yet another film of his to be debating as the years and decades go by.
B00005Q66T|5.0|A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album is a massive achievement. Two &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums is a stunning achievement. Three &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CDs is a phenomenon. Following &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; and &quot;Something To Remember,&quot; &quot;GHV2&quot; looks back at Madonna's greatest artistic achievements of the last decade or so. Taken with her previous two hits sets, it is hard to fathom that Madonna was able to achieve so much success so many times. Her trick was to keep things real--real spirituality (&quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Secret,&quot; &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;), real attitude (&quot;Human Nature,&quot; &quot;Erotica,&quot; &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;), real heartbreak (&quot;The Power Of Good-bye,&quot; &quot;Take A Bow&quot;), and real fun (&quot;Deeper and Deeper,&quot; &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; &quot;Music&quot;). Though the included version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; sticks out like a hiker in a prom dress, and there isn't anything new added for kicks, &quot;GHV2&quot; is filled with yet 15 more reasons why Madonna simply rules.
0783235666|5.0|After having basically drawn up the blueprint for the modern horror film in 1960 with PSYCHO, Alfred Hitchcock took another step into the macabre with his 1963 thriller THE BIRDS. In spite of the advancements made in special effects and computer graphics in the nearly forty years since it was originally released, THE BIRDS still manages to be extremely convincing in its own way, and terrifying as well...<br />Rarely in the horror film genre has there ever been a film as low-key on the acting side that at the same time has ever been this strikingly well made. This was almost certainly what Hitchcock had in mind when he and screenwriter Evan Hunter adapted the Daphne Du Maurier story upon which THE BIRDS is based. The general low-key tone of acting is in keeping with the film's approach, which is cold, clinical, and deeply unsettling. THE BIRDS is also claimed by science fiction film fans as one of their own, but at no time does Hitchcock offer any real explanation, scientific or otherwise, for the birds' attacks. But there is clearly a great deal of psychological tension, and this is far more disturbing than any long-winded explanations of any kind.<br />Featuring Oscar-nominated special effects work from Ub Iwerks, Ray Berwick (who trained the birds), and Lawrence Hampton, along with pictorial designs by master effects artist Albert Whitlock, THE BIRDS has proven to be every bit as influential on the horror genre as PSYCHO, though in a different way. One can see the influence of this film's final sequence on films like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and STRAW DOGS, where homes come under violent nighttime sieges. Even better, one can clearly see the influence this film has had on Steven Spielberg, whose two suspense masterpieces DUEL and JAWS clearly owe a debt to the Master.<br />If one can get past the film's age, and the arguably dated special effects work, one is left with one of the most brilliant and chilling horror movies of all times. It is rated 'PG-13' for scenes of tension and slightly bloody violence, but it is yet one more masterpiece in Hitchcock's lengthy and distinguished canon.
0553573403|5.0|This is an excellent book, full of twist turns and memorable characters.  Unlike other corny fantasy epics, even the best hero and vicious evildoer can die here.
B000001Y42|5.0|This has to be one of the best metal albums of the decade (1992-2002).  Unlike most of the other Limp Bizkit albums, this one is very dark and extremely heavy.  Fred hasnt yet developed into a song writer.  You can really tell.  The lyrics dont flow very well and they dont seem to fit together.  Borlands guitar playing dominates the album.  He plays so well it is unbeliveble!!!!!!!!!!!  Sam Rivers is one of musics best electric bass players.  John Otto really knows how to work to work those sticks and ex-House of Pain member DJ Lethal make the perfect combo for a Metal album.  Even thought the singing isnt that great, Fred sings it with so much felling it seems to work (even though it doesnt).  There isnt one song on the album that isnt bad, like on all there other albums.  The song Leech, featured on this album, is actually a the demo version that was given to Korn.  I really think that this band could be one of the most influencel Rock/Rap/Metal bands in history.  Although Borland quit(probably the most talented person on all three albums and in the whole band), you should still pick up this album.  Pick up Borlands other album, Duke Lion Fights the Terror.
B00000IAU3|3.0|Okay, so after a year or so of being bonked over the head with &quot;Thank You&quot; I finally caved and bought the CD.  Not for any real love of &quot;Thank You&quot;, but because Dido's brother, Rollo, is one half of Faithless and I like Faithless.  The &quot;Back To Mine: Faithless&quot; CD includes the cut &quot;My Life&quot; from Dido's &quot;No Angel&quot;.  Taken as separate releases, &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot; have very distinct flavors.  I think &quot;My Life&quot; is the better song, better written and possessing greater insight, yet &quot;Thank You&quot; was the radio hit, no doubt boosted by Eminem's use of it in &quot;Stan&quot;. (BTW, you haven't heard &quot;Stan&quot; until you hear the whole thing, including samples, in Dutch.)<br />One has to wonder about Eminem's choice of this song -- yeah, it's catchy and has a great hook -- but it's uncanny how it reflects the common theme of co-dependency that is so prevalent in pop music, particularly that performed by women.  But, I digress...<br />Taken in parts, &quot;No Angel&quot; has some outstanding facets.  The production values, as one would expect, are stellar.  Taken as a whole, however, &quot;No Angel&quot; devolves into blandness.  The shiny smooth production is aural novocaine:  one tune rolls over into the next without the listener even noticing.  Too bad, because the songwriting on a number of tracks deserves better attention and dramatization.<br />No question Dido has a lovely voice and, despite the monotonous fluffiness of the production, possesses serious songwriting chops, which she shares with various collaborators, including brother Rollo.  For songwriting, I give it a 4.  For overproduction and homogeneity, I give it a 2, which averages out to a nice round, middle-of-the-road 3.  Easy on the ears and brain, good background, but needs some pepper.  Maybe next time.
0783226063|5.0|If I HAD to pick what I considered the \\"best SF novel so far\\", I would have to say it is DUNE.<br />That in mind, when this movie version came out originally on VHS, I was mainly disappointed, yet appreciative of the effort.<br />Over the years, I have probably seen this movie 20 times or more. Last week (March 2002), I watched the repulsive Dune TV mini-series. I then realised just how good the 1984 movie attempt is/was.<br />OK, this movie does not follow the book exactly, and it is not possible to do the book justice in under 10 hours. The movie is lacking in its characterisation of a few of the second string characters such as Gurney Hallack, Duncan Idaho, Stilgar, etc etc.<br />It, however, is excellently cast. The casted actors suit the characters wonderfully. Sting is excellent as Feyd, as are the actors who portrayed Paul, Alia, Jessica, the Duke, and escpecially the Australian actress who was Shaddap Mapps.<br />I found \\"the voice\\" done excellently and I liked, and now appreciate even more, the way the characters' inner thoughts were portrayed to the viewer.<br />I would have given this 3 to 4 stars in the past; but now having re-read the book (for the 20th time), watched the poor miniseries, and re-watched the VHS version, I now give this movie 5 stars.<br />The DVD is on my birthday wish list!
B00000ADG2|5.0|After the break-up of the Fugees (AKA Refugee Camp), the only member that has been the most successful was favorite member Lauryn Hill.  All fell in love with her after the solo in the re-make Roberta Flack's &quot;Killing Me Softly (With His Song).&quot;  Blessed with a Phenominal voice and supreme rapping, Lauryn was truley a touchstone in late 90's R&amp;B and  Hip-Hop.  The standout Track on this album has got to be &quot;Doo Wop (that thing)&quot; which was by far her most popular single, along with &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;To Zion&quot; and a flawless remake of the classic oldies &quot;Can't Take My Eyes off of You.&quot;  No doubt the other Fugees members were talented, but Lauryn seemed to have that certain spark of talent that people admired and loved.  Whether or not she decides to release another album in the future, this one has got to be one of the best solo-from-group works of all time.  No one can mix R&amp;B, Hip-Hop, Motown and Pop the way Lauryn can.  Kudos to her and hopefully a new release in the future.  Good Job Lauryn!!
0441172717|5.0|When confronted with someone who says &quot;I don't read SF because I don't like it!&quot;, I always ask them what have they read? Have they read Dune? The answer is always no. And those who go away and read Dune, change their mind and usually will seek other quality SF novels to read.<br />I first read Dune in about 1967(?) as a high school student. I have re-read it many times. To me it was the first hard SF novel to FULLY develop and reveal an entire culture and history as backdrop to the story. Others have tried since; most have failed or at least fallen short of Dune.<br />DUNE is to SF what Lord of the Rings is to Fantasy; simply the best.<br />If you want to know anything about the story, don't look here, just READ IT! I promise you wont be disappointed.<br />I'm about to start reading it again in the next few days!
B0000028VT|5.0|This is the first Mariah Carey album I bought on tape as a little 3rd grader. After hearing the hits \\"Hero\\", \\"Dreamlover\\" and \\"Without You\\" I was hooked.  They have such beautiful vocals, music and lyrics. \\"Hero\\" has to be Mariah's signature song and one of the best songs ever (she wrote it herself). It has so much meaning and became even more popular recently due to the events of 9/11. I honestly don't get what the main reviewer was thinking. This is beautiful music. Just beautiful. It's jam packed with Soul and Emotion. My favorites are \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\", \\"Hero\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"I've been Thinking of You.\\"  \\"Never Forget You\\" was also a single but not commercially released.  The title track \\"Music Box\\" is beautiful and is composed of the standard tones one usually finds when opening a music box, and of course accompanied by Mariah's beautiful vocals.  Overall, if you're a fan of Mariah and are starting a collection, I would definatly reccomend this album. It's essential. It's creative. It's timeless. It's beautiful. Nothing more really to say. I give \\"Music Box\\" an A+
B000002C2E|5.0|This CD explores the darkest corners of human experience in stark, jolting honesty.  Regret, self-pity, anger, despair, dread, anxiety, they are all here in spades.  Sounds like a real downer huh?  Fortunately Dylan's poetic brilliance and the spooky groove of the production and playing transform the tunes from what could have been mere emotional ...[destruction]into a transcendent sedative.  Dylan has achieved a level of existential darkness and obscurity that more immature bands, who seem like they're trying for the same thing... can only dream about.  This is one more facet of a true master.
0446310786|1.0|I'm sorry everyone. I don't see why this book is so fabeulos. I would give it a zero. I find no point in writing a book about segregation, there's no way of making it into an enjoyable book. And yes i am toataly against segragation. I've caught my self in english class asleep. Also if your gonna write a book, give more detail please. I'm getting so fed up with it i just got the cliff notes. Read this book if you read every book that is such a hit. But rather than that burn all the pages exept the last chapter. Thanks to all my friendswho had to tourchure threw reading this disgrace and supporting me in not likeing the book. By the way, DO NOT BUY, because if i find it in your house i won't think to kindly of you.
B00003CWL6|2.0|American Beauty is perhaps one of the best examples of the fact that if you can be \\"counter-culure\\" then you will always have the sympathy of the critics.<br />The story is essentially what teen-agers used to refer to as \\"Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll\\". In fact, the story has the feel of what a teenager would write. This is supposedly a critique of suburban culture, but other than being set in suburbia, there is little here that is particular to suburbia. <br />The story's central character is a father who is disatisfied with his life. He lusts after his daughter's friend, his wife is focused on her career, and his daughter has the usual teenage angst over life, etc. His neighbour, who is not the business type, inexplicably reads the Wall Street Journal, (which any young person can tell you is the mark of an evil man). The neighbour's son sells drugs, so that makes him sympathetic and also means that he has a deep understanding of the human condition. Of course, the writers must have realized that drug dealers are not necessarily sympathetic characters to those over 20, so they made sure that the father (remember he reads the Wall Street Journal), is a man who viciously beats his son. In addition, there is another twist to his character that is straight out of an episode of Oprah.<br />Our protagonist, disatisfied with his life, decides to quit his well paying job, which he felt was de-humanizing, and get a job at a burger joint (which is apparently not de-humanizing). He starts to do drugs and listens to classic rock tunes and his life is suddenly better. (See what I mean about the type of story that only a young kid can appreciate?) Alas, his wife doesn't go along with this. She wants to do well at her career and doesn't like it when our hero isn't careful to not dirty the furniture. Clearly, she is not \\"with it man.\\" (Forgive the 60's phraseology, but that is where this movie belongs). <br />One tired cliche after another is brought out to prove what is wrong withAmerica, though frankly, none of the things they are criticizing are particular to America. (Oops, I forgot: Wall Street Journal = Evil).<br />So why 2 stars instead of 1? The acting is quite good, and there is a certain dreamy like quality to the directing that hides some of the juvenile nature of the plot.<br />Don't waste your time with this laughably immature film.
0140434267|5.0|I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth  universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"<br />Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the  main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.<br />I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.<br />When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.<br />From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.<br />Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.<br /><br />The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry.  This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.<br />When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)
6305972591|1.0|...This movie is such a waste of time, the story presented ...stinks, the gore is pathetic, the acting looks like the they killed and then resurected bad TV comercial Actors, and for the most part every aspect of this movie stinks...  To make matters worse this spawned 5-6 sequels. ARGH!!<br />LEts start with the story.  A young couple on vacation get lost on a side road along a corn field, they accidentally hit a kid along the way, only to find out he was already dead.  They take him to the nearest town, which is deserted and soon are attacked by fanatic cultist that are kids ranging from Infacy all the way to 17 (at 18 you must enter the corn).  They think God lives in the corn (but the average movie goer already knows it's a demon) and thus we set the setting for a complete waste of time.<br />It gets worse.  This was based of a truely disturbing, yet highly entertaing short story by Stephen King.  This is yet another piece of work completely ruined by Hollywood.  Don't rent or buy this, it's not even worth a penny.
6304082428|5.0|This is a superb production. Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth round out a marvellous  cast. Alison Steadman is a superb Mrs Bennet, shallow and witless; Benjamin Whitrow an excellent beleagured Mr Bennet and Crispin Bonham-Carter and Susannah Harker do a fine job as the lovers Mr Bingley and Jane Bennet.<br />The production is well shot with beautiful location work and the adaptation, while it does tinker with some of the dialogue, benefits from the extended length of a miniseries over a movie. The BBC does this sort of adaptation so well with great locations, good writing and directing and a supporting cast that do a great job all the way down the cast list to Darcy's housekeeper. I particularly thought the Regency costumes in this production were marvellous, keep an eye out for the differences in dress between the rural Bennet girls and Mr Bingley's sisters.<br />I won't waste space going over how marvellous Jane Austen's story is, how witty and sharp her look at the life of the rural gentry.<br />The one problem you will have with this production is that once you sit down to watch it is impossible to stop and most of a day disappears as you are trapped in Jane Austen's world.
B00004Y87O|5.0|amidst john carpenter's other cult classics (the thing, halloween, big trouble in little china, assault on precinct 13), escape from new york is probably in my opinion one of the most memorable. not for its storyline (which is a touch cliched), but for its atmosphere. carpenter has always had a talent for creating an atmosphere, he did it in the thing with its cold antarctic setting, and with big trouble in little china with its underground chinatown setting, and here with a &quot;post-apocolyptic&quot; new york setting. kurt russel is in fine form here, not only physically but acting-wise especially. he says fewer lines than one might expect from a protagonist, but his expression and use of eyes (like ive mentioned several times before) is very commendable. van kleef does a good job here as well. much better than its &quot;sequel&quot;, escape from l.a. (though i did like that film better than most, since i am a major carpenter fan). a must-buy for carpenter fans or russel fans!
B00005OMTT|5.0|If you are an Enigma fan you'll enjoy this 18 track cd. This is a very excellent cd in that you can play it and drift into a different world. The different sounds and voices in this album make it very relaxing and calming. I have been an Enigma fan since they came out with their first album &quot; Cross of Changes&quot; and I have enjoyed the music since then. The soft beginning of &quot; The Landing&quot; to the crescendo of &quot;The Silence Must Be Heard&quot; makes for an incrediably powerful must have in your cd collection.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|ok, lemme just say i like angelina jolie (girl interrupted, pushing tin, both were great) and she totally looks and acts the part of lara croft. and ive played the game and most (lol) of its sequels and its a great game. however!, i was very dissappointed in the storyline (which tries to be clever too much) and dialogue that is just terrible! the action wasnt that great either (except for a few impressive scenes). another thing, i didnt think the soundtrack was up to par either, same with the camerawork, it seemed like the cinematographer was content with stationary shots 80% of the time. anyways i was really hoping this movie to be really good, but somehow it got botched up...
0887307280|4.0|The ideas the author conveys in this book are valuable, to say the least. Everyone who is thinking of starting or has started their own business needs to read this book. I just wish he would get to the point a little quicker. I found myself skimming ahead to find where he starts talking about the real issues again, instead of telling us a long, drawn out story. But still a must read. By implementing his ideas in my company, I'm sure I will save myself many headaches down the road, maybe even avoiding failure.
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle opens with the thunderous bass-driven jam of \\"One of these days\\". After five minutes of menacing space rock its pumping rhythm slides scerenely into the gorgeous breezy opening of the dreamy, soothing glow of \\"A pillow of winds\\". The loose melodic bliss of \\"Fearless\\" is followed by the lazy, mediteranean and somewhat Bacharack-like \\"San Tropez\\" and the tongue-in-cheek blues of \\"Seamus\\". The first five tracks of Meddle offer the listener a treat of mellow tunes, poetic lyrics and great playing. Meddle closes with the suitably titled \\"Echoes\\", a surrealist masterpiece from beginning to end. It would not be going to far to say that it was the composition par excellance'. The least I could say is that \\"Echoes\\" is the perfect example of the mind-bending way in which the Floyd harness sound. Amongst the crescendoes of soloing, roaring basslines and frantic drumming there are moments of awesome calm. Sometimes of pure relaxation and sometimes of unnerving intensity. The band carve a magnificant sculpture of sound and emotion and it is beyond the english language to describe just how good it is. Honestly, it is one hell of a composition. Nick Mason once said that the point of the Floyd's music was to move you and stretch your imagination. It suceeds in doing this to more than impressive results here. People often buy Meddle just for \\"Echoes\\" and call the first tracks mere \\"filler\\" but in reality the first side of Meddle shows great diversity of style and (particularly on \\"A pillow of winds\\" and \\"Fearless\\") shows just what brilliant songwriters Gilmour and Waters were together. It also shows Roger's lyrics reaching a peak. Everything about this album is fantastically original and has the same sense of experimentation that you'd expect from Pink Floyd at this time, but it also has many, many accessable moments and some concise but relaxed songs which will be appealing to anyone who can appreciate good music whether they already have a taste for the band or not. Everybody should at least try this album and those who can recognise something amazing when they hear it will keep listening until they know every detail of an album which is far less predictable than it is given credit for.
1558908498|4.0|.. but after all, it's a sequel.<br />I think that the problems with most sequels is that they have too much to live up to - they're tied down by too many pre - existing characters and events. In this case, there was another problem which was mentioned in the commentary - the fact that the script was leaked so often made the crew change it around so much it seems shaky at times, and the ending a little hard to believe...<br />But it still wasn't bad enough to take off more than one start

B00005PJ6M|2.0|Bill & Teds 'original' & definitely excellent adventure was a great movie - largly because it was such a simple movie, about simple character, but very original.<br />But this movie, the 'bogus journey'wasn't aws original, funny or interesting to watch. Knowing that a sequel can't be surprising as the original, the team that created this movie tried being original, and ended up over doing it A LOT... For example: a Martian scientist (the best in the galaxy) that can split into 2 smaller creatures, and become one again. Or death as a raper, or all 'robot usses' - both the good and the evil or the futuristic fashions in pastel plastics imitating the 'good robot usses' clothes... There were a few recycled jokes like Missy (the boys peeping down Missy's shirt, 'She's your mom, Dude', Missy's marriage to...) which are funny more because of the context rather than the joke itself.<br />I bought this DVD without watching it first based on the fact I loved the original so much. This was a HUGE mistake...
0812932293|5.0|Losing my virginity by Richard Branson is one of the most amazing autobiographies ever. Speaks of his childhood, his first business, the student magazine, Virgin Music, etc. Amazing, just buy it!
0671679600|2.0|I don't get it. This book is supposed to be a classic of the horror genre. Just about everyone agrees on that point. The negative reviews stick out like sore thumbs. Well, here's another sore thumb. The premise is great. An evil carnival comes to town and preys on the emotional and spiritual weaknesses of the residents. The problem is that the story gets lost in the enigmatic writing style that Bradbury chose for this book. Half the time, I didn't really know what was going on. Maybe I'm missing something. If I am, I'm missing it by a mile.
0679735909|1.0|This is one of the most tedious books I have ever read, from the painstaking reproduction of turgid Victorian poetry to the unbelievably bad and predictable Scooby-Doo ending (A-ha! I knew it was the Professor under the mask all along!) Hundreds of pages of writing, and yet the characters remain caricatures throughout (what do they like? do they have interesting opinions about anything? what do they do when they aren't squabbling with each other?) I cannot recall one compelling sentence in the entire book.  It's like trying to chew dust.
6304981635|4.0|Enter the Dragon is a 5-star martial arts movie, period.  It combines the best aspects of its genre in its period and sets a standard for future martial arts pictures to come.  It is surprisingly well directed, a point which is often overlooked, with wonderful pacing and visual composition, and a wry wit.<br />HOWEVER, this DvD does not present the movie as it should be presented.  Added in are two scenes which siginificantly detract from the smooth flow of the film.  They are cheesy stereotypical kung fu movie tropes; the first is a ridiculous conversation between Bruce and his game-show-host voiced master, which clumsily foreshadows the second added scene, a horrible voice-over flashback during the final showdown.  These scenes were cut for a REASON, and unfortunately Lee's widow Linda Lee demonstrated a complete lack of cinematic knowledge by pressuring the producers to put these scenes back in.<br />What keeps this DvD from being a 5 star product is the inability to play the movie without these additional scenes.<br />That said, it is still an excellent DvD to own, with some wonderful extra footage of the Master in action.
B00004HYLF|5.0|I could go on forever about this disc but I won't. This has always been considered one of the greatest fusion CDs ever and to many it is. I wouldn't argue with them for I think that it is, at the least, one of the top five. \\"Romantic Warrior\\" has everything; Rock, Jazz, Classical, and Latin influences are all over the place on this disc. \\"Medieval Overture\\" is just a prelude to the madness that is coming. \\"Sorceress\\" is a Lenny White compostion and is funky. Everyone is perfect and the groove is impossible not to appreciate; for it is simple and complex at the same time. \\"The Romantic Warrior\\" is an acoustic piece and is also unbelievable. Dimeola, Clarke, and Chick all show their mastery of their instruments. The tune has Clasical, Jazz and Latin influences and is one of ,if not the, best that Corea ever penned. \\"Majestic Dance\\" is a Dimeola tune. There are many unison lines and it isn't quite as guitar orientated as his solo work; however, it is a preview of Al's solo career. \\"The Magician\\" is Stanley's contribution to the CD. Unison lines and superior musicianship abound this piece. The grand finale tune is also ridiculous. The first part is an example of Chick's keyboard virtuosity. The second part is unreal. All four members of the band follow Clarke's lead and then they take turns at mystifying their audience. You'll listen to this work over and over. This recording was the last of this RTF lineup. RTF never was or became better. Any fusion/ Guitar/Bass/Drum/Keyboard fan should buy this IMMEDIATELY.
0321012542|5.0|As of late I have seen some pretty strong arguments for reading Shakespeare (even if he really didn't write everything attributed to him).  Most of my recent reasons have to do with my teaching high school English.<br />For my sophomores, it is Julius Caesar, and for my seniors, it is Hamlet.  Having the need to read along with the students from a second text, I always reach for my Bevington Edition.  I like having a second text available, but more importantly, I love having such a comprehensive discussion of Shakepeare at hand each time the moment arises(rare as they are) that a question comes up either during the reading or discussion.  The Bevington edition serves me well whenever I teach Shakespeare because I can easily find important information quickly.<br />I also like the fact that the text is modernized in spelling, presented in a clean and legible font, while keeping an academic presentation in mind.  For me this simply means I can read it for enjoyment as well as for teaching purposes easily and without any real problems.<br />I also like the way that the plays are organized.  with many of the other complete editions I have owned throughout the years, chronological order gets to be a bother.<br />Now, I am no real scholar, but I have acted in several college level and other post-educational setting productions of Shakespeare, and from an actor's point of view the Bevington edition scores well again.<br />If you are deep into scholarly persuits I am certain you can find flaws within the Bevington edition, as could be found by any expert in any edited literary text.  However, as far as an all-round, readable, and informative version of the complete works of Shakespeare (or whoever REALLY wrote all the plays etc.) the Bevington edition has my vote as the best one I have yet to see.
B000002OTL|5.0|This is got to be the best one ever. It's a great array of different songs that fit the tone of the movie and are mostly relevant with the time period it took place in. <br />With songs like &quot;Misirlou&quot;, &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot;, &quot;Let's Stay Together&quot;, &quot;Bustin' Surfboards&quot;, &quot;Girl You'll be a Woman Soon&quot;, Flowers ion the Wall&quot;, &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;, and &quot;Surf Rider.&quot; Plus dialogue like &quot;royale With Cheese&quot; make this soundtrack a necessity for anyone. Al Green, Kool &amp; the Gang, and Dusty Springfield. Come on get it, it's excellent stuff.
0517543052|4.0|I picked up this book about 8 years ago for the first time and as I was reading it I felt as if my mind was being [pulled] in the pages.  I have bought it 3 separate times but always feel compelled to give it away to someone who I feel could benefit from the wisdom inside.  <BR>This book comes in 3 parts...the first part is an account of the author's pre \\"Ram Dass\\" life as a PhD and scholar....then to make a long story short, he did some psychedelic drugs, and discovered that he actually liked what was inside his mind and wanted to try to find a way to live in \\"the now\\" without the drug experience attached.  His journey took him to finding a guru..interesting stuff but then to my favorite part of the book:<BR>the middle....this is a brown paper rambling section full of rich artwork, roughly drawn cartoons, biblical and buddhist references, and what I found to be great truths....all about what it means to \\"be here now.\\"<BR>While some of it is overly simplistic, and some of it is gratuitous reference to organized religion, most of it is just an alternative way of thinking about yourself, your problems, lifestyle, and family issues.  What I took away from this book was a renewed sense of self awareness and it even made me realize that different is not bad, its just different.  I guess I was at the point in time in my life where I needed that insight into my own behaviors and thought processing capabilities.  In any event, it OPENED MY EYES!!!  It made me look at everything differently, and almost instantaneously changed my perception of the world and others in it.<BR>The third part, which is called something like \\"cookbook for a sacred life\\"  really gets into the practice of buddhism and meditation, which was not the route I chose to go with my life...but in any case, a great and interesting read for anyone interestied in gaining valuable insight into the mystery of their life and life in general.
B0000060NF|5.0|Plenty actually when it comes to this album. The best soul album ever created and one of the most satisfying musical albums ever.<br />First is the great title track \\"What's Going On?\\" which is a great statement about the Vietnam War at the time, and can stand as any war type song. Then there's \\"What's Happening Brother\\" which is a great song unto itself and very nicely done by Gaye. \\"Save the Children\\" is a nice song that just speaks to me. \\"God is Love\\" is a wonderful song and is got great vocal talent by Gaye. \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" is another grand song done by Gaye. And of course there is \\"Inner City Blues\\" which I think is another great song done vert well by Gaye. For a great Soul Album you can't go wrong with this album or any of Gaye's albums for that matter. Pick it up!
B000002KAG|5.0|I would call this album one of the ten best in rock'n'roll. I feel it ranks with Magical Mystery Tour, Abbey Road, or Revolver by the Fab Four, 5D by the Byrds, or Fresh Cream by Cream. The album is coherent, even though one finds blues AND bluegrass influence. This being the Grateful Dead's first album, it is striking that this band seems to have burst forth upon the world as a fully mature entity, as did Gustav Mahler, with his near-fully developed style and personality shown in his first symphony, Das Klagende Lied. The Grateful Dead's roots lie in bluegrass and blues. It is a shame that so few rock'n'roll groups pay attention to bluegrass music. I can name only one rock'n'roll album that devotes itself to some extent to bluegrass, namely, Seatrain's first album, which features Richard Greene on fiddle. This album, which is on \\"Edsel Records\\" features a number of exquisite tunes, e.g., Outwear the Hills, As I Lay Losing, Pudding Street, and Sweet Creek's Suite with its amusing Venture's-style surf guitar episode. It is really no surprise that these two albums remind me of each other. Seatrain also has some blues influence (though it does not show on this album), since Seatrain contains members from the former Blues Project.
B00000273P|5.0|Ok you Lovers of this &quot;Michelangelo's David&quot; of the Music world.<br />Here's my story. 1990. I was in the middle of a Divorce. Life was all grey and sour...I fled to Capri, this great rock in the blue Mediterranean. I'm surrounded by lovers, honeymooners...Oh I'm ready to drown myself.  Then in this tiny record store in some grotto comes Paddy's voice. &quot;Sugar cubes..they're ok, but I don't think that I'll catch you that way.&quot;  Hope stirs. The album had just been released. The king of lost love with aural salvation-such an honest troubadour. Poetry. I have the 3X2 Marquee for the Jordan Tour framed in my music room. Symbol of Love's wonder gently watching over me. Buy it and Believe.
0748662529|5.0|The dry, endless land of Botswana is the unlikely backdrop of Alexander McCall Smith's detective novel (the first in a series) and the beloved home of his creative, unorthodox P.I. Precious Ramotswe.   The resilient Mma Ramotswe, having survived a brief, abusive marriage, the loss of her child, and the death of her father, sells the cattle she inherits to start the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency (wryly noted as the only one of its kind in the country) and proceeds to deftly handle a string of seemingly disparate domestic cases before getting caught up in the sinister circumstances surrounding an abducted boy. Smith crafts more than a detective in the character of Precious, however, as Precious defies cultural expectations by being a one- woman community service, a confidante for those who need somehow to reclaim their own lives. The novel subtly presents a landscape of changing cultural and gender roles as well as the tensions that arise between those citizens who honor the traditional African family bonds and those parasites that would give the old traditions a bad name. But Smith's hand isn't heavy, and his humor is like a warm desert breeze. Finally, his work is a vibrant celebration of Africa and those Africans who strive for a good, peaceful life. The heart of the book is contained in the epigrammatic shape:   <BR>              africa<BR>           africa africa<BR>        africa africa africa<BR>           africa africa<BR>              africa<BR>                                      <BR>    The shape of the continent--Precious--Mother Africa--- a good, fat woman!
0446677450|1.0|This book like so many others seems like a half brain attempt at making some cash...<br />If you really want to see what all this marketing is about, buy the book, read until you don't want to read anymore, and then return it before your 30 days are up at Barnes or Borders.<br />The whole book can be summarized into the following:<BR>1. don't spend your money.<BR>2. invest in real estate<BR>3. try Multi Level Marketing<BR>4.

B00000DHRX|4.0|Where in the world is George Michael nowadays? Who knows? His last album, the cover CD \\"Songs from the Last Century\\" tanked mightily and his last proper album before that, \\"Older\\", is by now 6 years old... So while we wait for George to wake up and smell the coffee, we have this 1998 sprawling (2 CDs, 140 min) \\"Best of\\" to remember what George was/is capable of.<br />The compilation is divided in \\"From the Heart\\" (CD1, read: the ballads) and \\"For the Feet\\" (CD2, read: the dance tunes). Nobody is going to question his genius for writing great songs, and they are all here: Careless Whisper, Freedom, Too Funky, Kissing a Fool, Faith, Heal the Pain, Cowboys and Angels, Monkey, Waiting for that Day, and go on and on. Marvelous!<br />Here is the problem: there are simply too many filler songs on this compliation (such as Desafinado, You Have Been Loved, A Moment with You, Spinning the Wheel, etc.) What would have worked better is a single CD, compiling all his greatest hits, no more, no less. Another beef I have is that one of his greatest hits, \\"I Want Your Sex\\", appears here as \\"Part 2\\", which is radically different from the song we all know and remember. What is up with that? So what could've, should've been a compliation of George Michael's greatest hits, isn't... Not that this compilation is bad, but it could've been greater.
B0000035E7|5.0|alot of people are complaining that these songs are not &quot;slick&quot; enough. or not &quot;grunge&quot; enough. you must understand- nirvana never looked at their music and said &quot;it's not grunge enough&quot;. they played their music how they wanted to play it. they didn't see their music in any genre. they just played good music. <br />this is some great music.  about a girl is my favorite, but i love the strait cobain-rock styles of mr. moustache and negative creep. this album is dirty, choppy, horribly produced, and it's probably one of the greatest albums to ever be released in the last 30 years.  simply beautiful music with absoloute, honest, and from-the-heart lyrics.  this music is good for everyone of any age. old people will definetly get into it because of the serious beatle's influence, and the kids will like it because the music genuinely good. <br />thanks, nirvana, for a great batch of music..
B000002O51|5.0|Even after 15 years, this is one of the best rock albums you can buy.  I first bought this album in college on the day it was released, and I just recently purchased the CD version.  Unlike much of my old 80's music collection, which just doesn't sound as good to me after 15 years, this album sounds just as good (or even better) today than it did all those years ago.  Goes to show how good music and good lyrics stay just that - good.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I thought this was one of the best movies I have ever seen I saw it 4 times in the theaters and bought the DVD the day it came out.  The soundtrack is also worth it.  The songs were perfect for this movie and this movie was perfect for me.  It included singing and dancing and heartbreak.  I recomended this to all my friends and they all fell in lvoe with it too.  This is totally worth buying...I promise that if you like singing in a movie and a love story then this is for you!
0694003611|5.0|I have been reading this book to my son since he was born, and we both love it.  The rhythm of the words makes it very calming; I use it when my son needs to refocus, as well as to start thinking about bedtime.  Now that he is 18 months old, he also can point to the fireplace, the lamp, the kitty, the clock, etc. when asked where they are, then point to OUR fireplace, lamp, etc.  It's a very sweet book, and I highly recommend it.
B000062TU1|5.0|I am 58 years old and I couldn't wait for this movie and it was everything I hoped for and more.  Comedy, action, three headed dogs, evil people, heros, villians, a great cast and a beautiful location.   In my opinion, not as good as \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" but for the audience it was intended for, it is the better movie and I can't wait for the next one.
B000002GQG|5.0|IN 1977, THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST ALBUM (LONG PLAY RECORD) I HEARD OF THE MOODY BLUES. I RECOGNISED THE SOUND OF 'NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN', BUT DID NOT HAD AN IDEA WHO IT WAS. THE MOODY BLUES RELEASED THIS ALBUM IN 1967 TO PROVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY COULD PLAY MUSIC. AT THEIR FIRST ALBUM (DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED) A COMPLETE ORCHESTRA PLAYED WITH THE BAND. AT 'IN SEARCH...' THE BAND SHOWED THAT THEY WHERE A SYMPHONIC ORCHESTRA THEMSELVES. THE RESULT WAS AN ALBUM WITH UNFORGETTABLE SOUND. THEY PLAYED WITH THE VERY FIRST ANALOG SYNTHESIZER: THE MELLOTRON, BASED ON RECORDED TAPES. <BR>THE MOODY BLUUES PROVED TO BE AN EXAMPLE FOR MANY OTHERS TO COME. NOWADAYS, IN 2002 THE BAND STARTS A NEW WORLDTOUR (USA, CANADA, EUROPE) ON EACH SHOW WILL BE PLAYED &quot;LEGEND OF A MIND&quot; and 'RIDE MY SEE SAW'.<BR>I AM LOOKING FOR THE NEW STUDIO ALBUM TO BE RELEASED THIS AUTUMN. HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE AGAIN!
B00004TH7Z|2.0|Well, let me put forward my views about Maiden studio albuns, that I divide in some categories below:<br />1) THE FIRST FIVE ALBUNS: Absolute classics, all of them:<br />* IRON MAIDEN<BR>* KILLERS<BR>* THE NUMBERS OF THE BEAST<BR>* PIECE OF MIND<BR>* POWERSLAVE.<br />Each of them has its own different vibe and even having different singers, are very, very good<br />2) THE \\"PROGRESSIVE METAL\\", GUITAR SYNTH AND KEYBOARDS ORIENTED ALBUMS:<br />* SOMEWHERE IN TIME - flat production, good songs but lifeless execution - something flopped here...<BR>* SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON - considered by many (not myself) their masterpiece.<br />3) THE NINETIES ALBUNS - in bigger or lesse extent, all of them ultimate failures, bad examples of hevay metal, according to MAIDEN HIGH STANDARDS!!<BR>* NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING - debut of Janick Gers. HUshed production that led nowhere. None of its songs are in the li set today.<BR>* FEAR OF THE DARK - the ammount of filler material increases dramactically...<BR>* THE X-FACTOR - the new singer, together with below average compositions, brings Maiden another step down<BR>* VIRTUAL ELEVEN - sales dropped so sharply that desperate measures were needed. In come Dickinson and Smith back...<br />So, where does BRAVE NEW WORLD belongs? None of the above. It belongs to the \\"old-band-trying-hard-to-make-more-money-reuniting their-best-line-up-again\\" category. The songs are cheesy, progressive again (no wonder- with Dream Theater producer KEvin Shirley at the helm...). The choruses are repeated endless times in the songs, a terrible new characteristic in Maiden compositions, developed in the atrocious THE ANGEL AND THE GAMBLER.<BR>Once all the excitement calms down, you´ll all see how bad this album is.<br />* VIRTUAL ELEVEN
0375707972|4.0|It was not until page 188 (of 218) that this book clicked with me.  Until that moment, \\"The Reader\\" was a quick read with little depth or reader engagement.  Mediocre, at best.  In a landslide, however, the story grabbed at my heart and tested my reasoning.  The climax of this story makes it a worthwhile read.<br />The final thirty pages depict a narrator torn by his past and present, and trying to reason his relationship with a Nazi SS Guard.  Beyond the themes of anti-semitism, hate, and prejudice, the narrator grapples with the forces of human nature.  His troubles are those that you and I will endure in our own lifetimes.  This story and its particular outcome begin to place our own circumstances and stories in perspective.  <br />If for no other reason that seeing how you react to the climax of the story, I highly recommend \\"The Reader.\\"  It begins as a shallow harlot's tale, but eventually wraps itself around your psyche.
044651652X|5.0|The story involves a woman who is married and comfortable - her husband is a very good provider and truly loves his wife as much as he is capable.  Their is no romance between the couple, but they do care deeply for each other and do a fine job of raising their children and provide a loving home for them.  A stranger rolls into town one day and stops to ask directions.  A mutual attraction quickly develops between the wife and this interesting stranger.  They are unable to stop the powerful romance that comes upon them like a strong force.  Ultimately, she is left with the decision of leaving her life as she knows it and running away with a man that has evoking feelings inside her that made her feel so alive, or doing the right thing for her family - faced with the decision, she is with her husband in their old farm truck on main street, she sees Robert leaving town in his pick up and she knows it's now or never.<br />This book left me in tears. I saw the movie, and it doesn't do the story justice. This is one of the best books I have ever read.<br />If you want to read about real undying love, this book is a must read.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever. It has everything from action to a lovely love story. If you have a heart you'll cry at the end of it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|At first I was like many people and thought this movie wold ruin my thoughts of what the wizard world is like but after I saw it I knew it was on of the best movies ever. It made the wizard world come alive for me. It also skiped some parts but if it showed all of the book it would take several tapes to hold it and countless hours to show it. I am glad they made it into a movie. I will also be seeing the rest of them not only in my mine but also on the screen.

0395389496|5.0|This is a book about a Christmas memory.  A little boy gets woken up on Christmas Eve by a trains whistle blowing.  He finds a train waiting outside his house to take him to the North Pole.  When he gets to the North Pole he sees Santa and he finds out that he has been chosen to receive the first Christmas gift.  All he wants is one of Santas bells off his sleigh.  He is the happiest boy until on the way home from the North Pole he realizes that there was a hole in his pocket and he has lost his bell.  This really makes him upset but he wakes up on Christmas morning to find the bell as one of his presents.  The thing is only people that truly believe in Santa Clause can hear the bell when it is rung.<br /> This is a great book.  It is beautifully illustrated and it really pulls in the reader.  I loved it when I was little and I still love it today.  I read it every year around Christmas and love it just as much every time I read it.  The pictures really draw the reader in also, and they follow the story greatly.  I think through this book, the author was trying to show that you have to have faith sometime.  Only the ones that truly believe can hear the bell and I think that goes for a lot of things in life.  I think it is a great story for children and adults of all ages.
B00003CX95|4.0|Just wanted to write a few words about Braveheart's main theme, the battle by the Scottish people against the oppressive English forces that had invaded and occupied Scotland many times. How can it be rascist to represent the invaders of a small peaceful country as the arrogant tyrants and the oppressed people of the invaded nation fighting for their freedom as the heroes? The point is the English did invade Scotland (and other countries) many times and did commit many atrocities such as slaughtering whole villages (such as Berwick), women and children included. Scottish forces only struck back against England with ten times the population and an army ten times as large and well equipped, in revenge and defiance. <br />Unfortunately it seems that many English people do not want to believe that there country ever did anything wrong (hence their dislike of Braveheart, The Patriot, Rob Roy etc.). All countries have had tyrannical rulers and/or done things during their history to be ashamed of. Why should England be any different? After all many English people still always like to speak badly of the French or the Germans as if they are enemies, having never forgotten The Battle of Hastings in 1066 or the Germans for the second world war. It may be worth remembering that the English monarchy were actually descended from the French, and that the current monarchy is descended from Scots, Dutch and more recently Germans and that Prince Charles and his siblings are all half Greek. The first legitimate King of a united Scotland and England was also a Scotsman King James VI of Scotland, King James I of Britain. So please dont call Braveheart racist and dont be ashamed about things your country did hundreds of years ago, to quote Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting&quot;it's not your fault&quot;, &quot;no, its not your fault&quot; .<br />Braveheart does have its faults and some of the changes of historical fact may have been slightly unnecessary, although most to be truthful are irrelevant. Point is its essence is based on a true story of a small nation led by a very courageous man overcoming great odds to defeat an invading army and lead his country back to freedom. Its an entertaining movie, which has inspired an interest in history that many people previously did not have and that should be applauded.
0452282152|5.0|Marvelous descriptions, delightful characterizations, flow of plot and the nice, not quite unexpected twist at the end, more, Tracy, please! Namste, Nancy Davison
B000002J1S|5.0|I first heard this album in 1980, only being aware of Genesis through their few FM tunes ('Your Own Special Way', 'Follow You Follow Me', 'The Carpet Crawlers') that made it to sporadic airplay. I was instantly hooked on Tony Banks' opening piano strains of the title track. Reading the album sleeve AND the lyric sheet, I was along for the ride. Several vinyl albums, import, domestic and re-mastered CD's later, I still find new voices, instruments, effects and so on, after thousands of listenings; for example, I only recently discovered the thematic relationship between the second half of 'Lilywhite Lilith' and 'The Broadway Melody of 1974'. Now, the album isn't perfect; 'The Waiting Room' is too long, and 'It' doesn't work for me after the second synth gliss, but that's a matter of taste. <br />The album gets a small amount of grief for its dated Moog and ARP sounds, but that's absurd - they used what they had at the time. Will songs of the '90's sound dated in 25 years because of all the sample playback and gated reverb? Does that affect their use or acceptance today? Besides, if dated sounds would be picked on, the pipe organ or Mellotron used throughout would be  better targets. And finally, what Tony does with the \\"cheesy\\" synth sounds in 'In The Cage', 'The Raven', and 'Riding The Scree' is astounding, both technically and melodically. Phil Collins' drumming is surprising to those who think only of his later 'I Can't Dance'-'Sussudio'- Motown output. What a shame he became famous if that is what curtailed his incredible drum skills. Mike Rutherford's bass playing lies a bit low in the mix, but his efforts are in the Geddy Lee/John Entwhistle mold - fast, counter-melodic, and not simply overlaying notes to the drum tracks. They are worth focusing on. Steve Hackett has a few shining moments ('The Supernatural Anesthetist' and 'The Lamia' solos) but mostly seems relegated to 12-string background instrumentals and growly rhythm guitar tracks. I've heard that therewere power struggles between him and the other members, and if his lack of presence on this album is evidence of this, I understand why he left two albums later. And there are few things more fun than trying to sing along with Peter Gabriel's Slipperman - \\"We like you have tasted love...\\" or the Doktor or 'Riding the Scree' - \\"Here I go...\\". While the lyrics are very well crafted, I have no additional insights to contribute (\\"slubberdegullions\\"?) - some are fairly clear, others are murky, probably deliberately. Either you like the story or you don't. I do recall hearing a story that he left after this album because, having written the lyrics exclusively, he couldn't go back to writing by committee.<br />Simply put, this is the only no-brainer shoe-in no-doubt absolutely-sure entry in the \\"Ten Albums With Which I Could Be Stranded on a Desert Island\\" list.
6300183211|5.0|This was an excellent film,, and nothing like he 1932 version with Paul Muni. Al Pacino was fabulous, as well as Pfeifer. They make a great team...

0571202284|5.0|Practical information put forth in a clear yet entertaining manner. Richard Williams' personality, passion and knowledge shine through while he illuminates both his own methods and the theory and practice of his mentors. I see this as a find for both newbies to the biz of animation and the seasoned alike. The structure is a graphic compilation of notes, antidotes and inspirational images that serve to educate, remind and inspire.
0790729377|5.0|Imagine the body of work that could have been produced had Marlon Brando kept up the physique and acting dedication to craft he shows in this movie.  These days you get little more than cameo appearances once in awhile as he [sells] himself to meet his bills.  <br />Yes, this film had it censorship problems, but to get something of this intensity on the screen in those days must have been quite an achievement.  It didn't become controversial with blatant language, blood, and nudity that today's films casually crank out.  No, this one got in trouble because it stretched the boundaries of what writing and acting can achieve, and today's movie makers would do well to watch and take notes.  This one displays it's intensity in the brute force of Brando, and the matching of wits with Vivian Leigh...    <br />...  Realize this, and you see a battle that no war movie can exceed.
B00005JL5S|5.0|This is an awsome movie from Stephen Chow.  Visually it's pleasing to the creative eyes.  Sound separation is much better than most Hong-Kong-originated movies.  Must See!!!!
0517122707|5.0|A couple of chapters into Confederacy, I was unsure if the book was pure genius or complete trash. Ignatius Reilly is so incredibly irritating. Imagine George Costanza, only several times more intelligent, political, fatter and self-absorbed. And much less likeable.<br />Even half way through, I wasn't sure if I loved it or hated it - probably both. I'm not sure why I kept reading. Schadenfreude is the most likely reason - it's almost like watching a really bad accident in progress.<br />In the end though, I thought it was brilliant, although I can understand those who hate it - there's a very fine line with this kind of work. It's a biting, dark satire, not funny in a laugh out loud kind of way (though there are a couple of moments,) but in an ironic, wicked way. New Orleans and the characters that inhabit its streets are wonderfully rendered, providing a great backdrop and foil for Ignatius. Pick up this book and keep at it - it's worth it, even if you hate it in the end.
B000002LCU|4.0|ALthough it can't match All Things Must Pass in scope, Cloud Nine runs neck and neck with ATMP in terms of the sheer quality of the songs. When Cloud Nine came out, it was a refreshing breath of fresh air. McCartney had tripped and stumbled with the release of a series of questionable albums; Starr was MIA for all intents and purposes and attempting a comeback; Lennon was still dead and hadn't been resurrected by Yoko, the Threatles and Jeff Lynne (with an assist from digital technology).<br />So George's album was manna from heaven for a Beatles fan. Lynne's production fits George's songs as snug as a glove much like Phil Spector's work did on Harrison's first solo album. The quality of the album is terrific with only one clunker (Breath Away From Heaven). When We Was Fab, Cloud Nine, Devil's Radio, If That's What It Takes, Fish On The Sand and Got My Mind Set On You (the last song was penned by Rudy Clark and not George)all are top drawer Harrison songs.<br />George was in the process of remastering his back catalog prior to his death. Hopefully Olivia (or Dhani) will continue the work George started. It would be a shame if one of George's finest albums continued to be out of print.<br />The sound quality of the CD is very good given the time it was issued (1987).
6304806426|1.0|The acting was good, the cinematagrophy was excellent, but overal this film was WAY overrated. The plot is simple, the characters are thrown together and supposed to have overwhelming desire for each other, but the whole time you suffer through a completely boring movie that had you left and came back half an hour later you have missed nothing. Elaine from Seinfeld expressed it best \\"This movie ...!\\"
B0000028RR|5.0|I'm not going to attempt to describe the music to you because I believe that music is interpreted differently by everyone. <br />Here is why I like them:<br />-- Conservatives hate it!<br />-- Former GOP candidate (Gary Bauer) thinks it is un-american and thinks it supports violence against the police (I guess they believe that anything that runs against the mainstream though is \\"evil.\\") <br />-- They are exponentially better then any other rap/rock fusion group to come out before or after them.<br />-- They support Amnesty International, Free/Independent Media, Leonard Peltier, FAIR, AK Press, and others.<br />They also create original, thought-provoking music.
B000001ES9|3.0|Starting out with the upbeat &quot;Finding My Way&quot; and ending with their biggest hit off this 1st album &quot;Working Man&quot;... this release is not the typical RUSH we've come to know &amp; love. This 1st glimpse of the Canadian band is more rock than progressive. John Rutsey does a fine job behind the drum kit (Neil Peart has not arrived on the scene yet) until he receives a Dr's note to send him packing. Keep in mind other great bands of the early rock era (Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Black Sabbath, etc)... many of these 1st releases are poorly produced and recorded and have somewhat different sound(s) of the more polished and mature versions of the bands yet to be. RUSH's debut falls into the same category. Anyone critiquing this first RUSH album and saying it is 'terrible' needs to have their head examined. While this one might not be outstanding (the best being &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, &quot;2112&quot;, &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot;), it is definitely worthy to be in any RUSH fan's library. Catchy tunes with decent guitar work from Lifeson - highlights include &quot;In The Mood&quot;, &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, &quot;Need Some Love&quot;, and &quot;Working Man&quot;. Check out the 7+ minute song &quot;Here Again&quot; (track 4)... this could have been a song penned by Jimmy Page &amp; Robert Plant.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I hated Pink's Music, I very much disliked her first album.  But this album in incredible, the turnaround in sound is amazing.  Even the first single, &quot;Let's get this party started&quot;, which had a similar sound to her first album, it was just a whole lot better.  And now the single, &quot;don't let me get me&quot; is incredible, the lyrics are much more inspired, the sound is so much better and meaningful.  I'd have to say this is great.
B00005Y228|5.0|This album's got great tunes to dance to, and believe me, you won't be able to sit down once you hear &quot;Can't get you outta my head&quot;, &quot;Dancefloor&quot;, and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;.  It's like you're going to a disco club, and the rhythm and beats get you dancing like never before.  It's very upbeat, and it's got some funky tunes in it too.  Give it a try.  It's worth it.
B000003BDY|3.0|The Stones were probably the best white band in the 60's to play rock n roll/blues and this is quite an example. They could play it with authority, not really trying to copy, but taking those songs and turning them into rolling stones songs, that somehow matched what they were all about: a bunch of ragged and dangerous guys with guitars. Even their ballads sound obscure and not polished. This Cd has some unforgettable tracks, like under the boardwalk, susie q, good times, ect. Probably just a couple of songs do sound like fillers, but this was just their second album.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is an eminently viewable movie. I <BR>purposely avoid watchable because it's <BR>not something thrown on for a few minutes<BR>before heading off to work.  Arabia takes<BR>time.  It's not an accurate biography of <BR>T.E. Lawrence (I like the book \\"A Prince <BR>of Our Disorders\\" for that).  Rather, it's<BR>a well shot, well acted, engaging film.<BR>     Is it long? Yes.  But not so long that<BR>you can't finish it in one sitting.  Enjoy<BR>the mastery of Lean's directing.  This is a <BR>film that deserves a proper commentary but <BR>unfortunately, you won't get it with this <BR>version.  The interviews and short films<BR>do help one understand why the work is so <BR>popular with great directors but they need <BR>another version with a film critic examining <BR>and explicting the film scence by scene. But <BR>the work can easily stand by itself.<BR>   Notice the famous shot where Lawrence's<BR>burning match becomes a blazing sun over the<BR>desert.  Marvel at the optical illsions <BR>produced by the desert and  magnified by<BR>clever set designers(see the extra short<BR>films and interviews for details).<BR>   Lawrence of Arabia doesn't have the<BR>compelling, driving plot of Bridge on the<BR>River Kwai but the magnificence of the<BR>cinematography and understanding of <BR>O'Toole's portrayl are not to be missed.<BR>As a final note, if you already have the <BR>video and I have been preaching to the<BR>choir than I recommend renting the DVD<BR>before buying it.  You might decide that<BR>the little extras are not worth your<br />hard-earned money; a sentiment I<BR>respect when it comes to upgrading a<BR>collection of music or films.
B00005RFAI|4.0|the first time I saw Pink was that video she did with Christinia, Lil' Kim, and Maya. Then I watch an espiode of MTV's Diary, with her as the subject. She got my interest. Once I saw her again on MTV's Making the Video, I was hooked. I love &quot;Get <BR>This Party Started&quot;, so much so that I bought her CD, Missundaztood not long after that. I love almost every song, espically the bluesy duet that she does with Steve Tyler, &quot;Misery&quot;. With this new CD, Pink proves to be an artist of considerable talent. I can't wait for her next one.
0792101448|3.0|I must be one of the very few people to not consider this a total classic.  It is a tough movie to review.  On the plus side, the score by Ennio Morricone might be the best ever written, with not one but two all-time classic themes ('The Man with the Harmonica' and the title track).  I also thought the cinematography was excellent - the dusty, dry and wide-open scenery of the west came to life better than in any John Ford movie.  Finally, as so many have said before me, the casting of Henry Fonda as the villain was an inspired choice, and his entrance near the beginning of the film accompanied by Morricone's 'Harmonica' music has to go down as one of the greatest screen entrances of all time.<br />However, there are some serious faults with this film.  As in other of his movies, Leone has a horrible tendency to overuse his great Morricone scores, thereby lessening their impact: the worst example here is the hauntigly beautiful title track, which Leone plays all too often.  Second, I was sorely disappointed at the lack of good scenes with Henry Fonda: there are really only two, one being his entrance and the second a flashback near the end.  Just as with Lee van Cleef in 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,' Fonda's brilliant portrayal of a sadistic killer lost too much screen time to the less interesting main character, here played by Charles Bronson.  Furthermore, as also in Good/Bad/Ugly, there are some huge plot inconsistencies - without giving away the plot there is one scene where a character appears to be perfectly ok and then ends up dying from an old gunshot wound five minutes later.<br />Finally and perhaps most important, Leone has to be one of the most pretentious directors of all time.  With a title like 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' I expected more than just a rehashing of the plot of 'Johnny Guitar,' and the silly scenes of the railroad baron staring teary-eyed at a picture of the pacific were too much for me.  Unfortunately Morricone must take some blame for this pretension, since his music is so good that Leone always seems to feel a need to show long boring shots of his uninteresting characters.  Also, the supposed mythic qualities of this movie fail to impress me - for a far better western with much more to say and a lot less pretension check out the far superior 'The Wild Bunch.'<br />In any case, if you're going to watch this movie, make sure your sound system is up to snuff - if you don't like anything else, you'll love the score.
B000001EJ8|3.0|Personally, I think this a mixed bag of incompatible styles thrown together.  I'd recommend you get Bladerunner's score, 1492's score, and Themes (for the Bounty tracks and a few other oddball ones here and there).  Between the three of those you have what is, in my opinion, his best works.  If you still want some of his more &quot;new age&quot; type electronic instrumentals and vocal tracks (with that odd-sounding singer), this one might be to your taste.  I think if you're really into that stuff, though, you'll have a huge variety to choose from in his other albums and you should probably just start buying those.  I mean, if you like that stuff, eventually you'll end up buying them anyway and this will just be redundant.  The mastering on Portraits is top notch, at least.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is my favorite comedy of all time. People who've discovered Murder By Death will usually rave about it and quote the many memorable lines. An unbeatable cast and visually its a film that rivals the mysteries its spoofing.<br /><br />Smart and silly at the same time and I admit its probably not the best comedy to watch with a large group, but that's mainly because most of the comedy is verbal. The dialogue is snappy and is best watched without distraction (at least the first time). But then it'll be a comedy you'll never forget and one you'll be constantly trying to convince people they have to see.
B00005M989|5.0|Prince is one of the greatest artists of all time! Every album he's ever released has had atleast one major hit song on it. This cd does such a GREAT job compiling some of the best songs ever released, including &quot;Cream&quot; and &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;. Not only does this cd define Prince, but it also defines an undescribable era of music!
B00005JKQX|4.0|This sentimental treatment of Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash's battle with schizophrenia glosses over the seamier aspects of his life to produce a rather formulaic story of triumph over adversity.  I call it formulaic, but there is a very nice surprise in the script about halfway through (which, unfortunately, is given away in the Amazon review).  In addition, every aspect of this production is top-notch.  The performances (especially by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly) are heart-felt, Ron Howard's direction is affecting, and the screenplay is literate.  If you resent the blatant emotional manipulation of a Hollywood star vehicle, you should stay away from this one.  If, like me, you are susceptible to skillful tugging of the heartstrings, you will probably enjoy it.

157492589X|5.0|If you made it this far, go a little further. Under &quot;Explore this video&quot; you will see the run time of the VHS tape is 240 minutes. The DVD run time is 360 minutes. Hmmmm....<br />Well, be warned, an intellectually challenged movie distributor has decided to edit 2 hours from Lonesome Dove! That is like touching up the Mona Lisa!<br />This miniseries was unique and may never again be equalled, at least in the Western genre. It is 6 hours of riveting televison, and trust me on this folks, you can't find 5 minutes of this former miniseries to edit out. To cut anything out was a serious diservice to anyone who has not experienced this.<br />Probably what I liked most was the thoroughly convincing portrayals of this cast. There were none who did not project an aura of believability, and each was so convincing that you may forget you are sitting in front of your television. I remember the time I rented this 6 hour series in 1994 not knowing what to expect. What I found was I did not get up from my couch for 6 hours. I was moved by the entire movie, and rarely does any movie elicit emotion in me. Gus McRae and Woodrow Call, backed by an absolutely fantastic supporting cast, will bring your televison to life.<br />Towards the end, when Woodrow is doing a favor for Gus, and doing so at the risk of his own life, the whole West hears of his exploits. In some dusty cow town somewhere, a local sees him, and reading of the story, questions Woodrow Call.<br />&quot;Just why are you doing this anyway?&quot; he asks. Call looks back and says &quot;Because I gave him my word.&quot; The local, thinking for a second, looks back and says &quot;I can see that you did&quot; and walks away. It is a perfect description of the character of Woodrow Call. Maybe the best mini-series to ever grace televison. Just make sure you see all of it.
B000002H4C|4.0|This soundtrack truely captures the essence of hard rock during the early 80's. It is still great today. The hidden gem just might be the only song by a woman on the soundtrack, Stevie Nicks. Her song &quot;Blue Lamp&quot; is awesome and is my personal favorite. Very good rock song and the rest of the soundtrack is great also. Goes really good with the movie.
B000000OSG|5.0|I don't know how anyone can write music that good. The lyrics make a lot of sense, they make me both laugh and cry at the same time, and they also make me think a lot. And the music...well, if any band has ever done better I want to hear it. The sound has some kind of romantic urbanity that you will hardly find in music anywhere. It's the kind of sound a lot of people have in mind...you know? Slash's guitar will give you an idea of what a human being is capable of, as long as his heart is in it. Besides Hendrix, Slash might be the guitarist with the biggest heart, and you can hear it on this album. Axl's lyrics will open your mind, instead of todays mindless [stuff]. This man actually had something to say, he had a vision. I'm looking foward to his new material, even if the old band's not involved - the stuff I heard is just as great. But first you need this one, it's an album to start with and one you'll always come back to. Buy the CD today - it's worth every single penny and will keep you busy for years. You'll probably need a little time to get into it, but you'll appreciate it. This music is worth listening and might just complete your life as much as it completed mine. The only bad thing about it is, that it's not the kind of music that makes you wanna pick up a pen or a guitar. It's the kind of music that makes you put these tools aside, cause it hardly gets any better than this. Anyway...don't hesitate - enjoy!
B00005QW9V|5.0|This movie is by far the best movie i have ever seen.<BR>Hedwig is funny, and the story is wild yet amazingly good, and so interseting. i would watch this move every day.<BR>Bacically if you don't see this movie don't see any movie. this will be the Best movie, you ever have or will ever see.<BR>Besides it being an amazing movie, the music is spectacullar.  buy the soundtrack for some great rock music.
B00003CXXP|4.0|When A.I. came out it did not recive good reviews from the critics nonetheless Spielburg is always worth a look and I found the picture well done with a excellent special effects, especially in the creation of the various types of robots.  There is some depth to the story and Osment's performance is first rate  The additional features on the making of the film  were good especially the included comments from Osment himself about his approach to the role. Those fans of Bi-Centennial man should like A.I.
B00005LQ6S|4.0|Okay, I admit it - I was more of a fan of the Highlander Series than the movies.  (I just couldn't get past Lambert's French accented Scot - hasn't he heard of dialect coaches??)  This movie is MUCH more bloody than the movie or the TV series.  Still, it gives more information into Duncan and Connor MacLeod. I did see the movie in the theatre and so the Director's Cut confused me a little because there seemed to be scenes that were changed.  I then read that the ending had been changed.  Now I would like to see the original one again.  Anyway, in summary, if you like Highlander, you will like the movie.  If not, you probably want to choose something else.
0525946284|5.0|This is another excellent story from Ken Follett.... The setting is France, just before D-Day. German communications from France to Germany pass through a huge telephone center in Sainte-Cecile. Its destruction would be a great aid to the success of the allied landings. The story opens during a failed attempt by British Major Felicity (Flick) Clairet and French Resistance fighters to destroy it. She escapes, but not before German Major Dieter Franck, a man capable of cruel torture, identifies her. As the days count down to D-Day, Flick leads five British women in a daring attempt to destroy the heavily-guarded telephone center, while she plays a desperate cat and mouse game with Franck and hundreds of Gestapo troops. This is not your usual spy story. It's the story of a clever and courageous woman. If you are looking for a tale that will hold your attention, this is it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Yes, I wouldn't characterize this guy's mind as beautiful. It's true that he was evidentally not thinking like the run-of-the-mill individual, which enabled him to dream up theories that eventually garnered him worldwide recognition in his field. But beautiful? Nah. Unique would be more a propos.<BR> <BR>Now, I must confess, I had my doubts going in to see the movie; I was dreading another \\"mental institution treatment\\" movie, which would be chuck full of shock treatments and sadistic nurses with pencils in their hair. Moments of dignity after years of degradation. You know the type of movie I mean. <br />But--I was pleasantly surprised! Well, that is if you can be \\"pleasantly\\" surprised at a movie that does treat mental illness at all. It actually takes on the elements of a thriller/suspense movie, and then whammo! Surprise plot twist that really fools the whole audience. <br />Russell Crowe is pretty good; so is Christopher Plummer as a supporting actor. The wife keeps winning awards. She is pretty and has a substantial role, but not really believable in that she doesn't seem to be living these experiences--if you see it, you'll understand what I mean. But no harm done. <br />Mind what I say now: Thumbs Up for Beautiful Mind!
B00003CXRM|2.0|It is unfortunate that a film that received such widespread acclaim and boasts being based on Homer's Odyssey could let its viewer down with such a hollow piece of work. The synthesis of Depression-era Mississippi and Homeric Greece falls flat on its face; instead of intelligently incorporating the Odyssey's themes, the film blatantly steals scenes to no apparent effect. The siren scene, for example, is of no consequence to the film; our hereos get sucked in by their song and then....nothing. The scene with John Goodman, who turns in yet another memorable albeit brief role as the \\"cyclops,\\" also has no significance to the \\"plot.\\" Rather it seems that the Coen brothers stole the form of the Odyssey but left the content behind, apparently for no other reason than to get people to see this vacuous movie.<br />Speaking of getting people into the seats....George Clooney was hopelessly unconvincing as a smooth talking backwoodsman with pommaded hair. The film is full of largely unknown actors, most of whom do impressive jobs, and their anonymity adds to the believability of the movie. Yet Clooney stands out like a sore thumb in the dusty, gritty setting. His character is not even that likeable. For example, his whole reason for escaping was to reunite with his wife, with whom he has about as much spark as a jar of mayonnaise. <br />A few redeeming qualities: the music is quite good, and Clooney's sidekicks give very good performances. But throughout the film, I was waiting for it to inspire me, to move me--hell, just make me laugh. It did none of this. Like the average American tourist in Europe, the Coen brothers did nothing more than walk through the motions of the Odyssey, stopping every now and then to take photographs of their ignorant, smug faces in front of a majesterial backdrop they fail to comprehend.
0141301155|1.0|It is most unfortunate that the only girl role models are such horrid brats!<br />My 4 year old daughter kept asking about and referring back to Veruca Salt and Violet Beauregarde. But can one say anything positive about those ill-fated characters? At this critical time in her development, when she's looking to women and girls (real and in literature) as role models, the only girls in sight are punished and humiliated for their aggressiveness.<br />I don't begrudge Charlie and his spiritual journey with Grandpa Joe, or his final reward. But there's nothing in the book of redeeming value for girls to identify with, unless one counts long-winded railing against spoilt kids with very bad habits?<br />The underlying message of this book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show. Mothers are either shrill, hysterical harpies or passive, feckless shadows.

B00005V1Y0|4.0|Being one of the folks who genuinely enjoyed \\"Moulin Rouge\\" I may be a little biased in terms of Lurhman's ability to dissect and enchant his audiences, ensuring a novel pleasure ride every time - from his raucous \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" to his incandescant \\"Sunscreen\\" rap-graduation-speech-single. \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is an early gem of a film that established the auteur-director in the minds of critics as a force to be reckoned with, and it's easy to see why. The movie soars like \\"Rocky\\" in its underdog and come-from-behind sequences and then boogies like \\"Dirty Dancing\\" only with far superior storytelling and plot devices that keep it fresh after repeated viewings. The principals are uniformly fine, fresh faced and passionate dancers, and Luhrman paces his show with remarkable staidness and simplicity - certainly nothing like his later edit-a-second epics. \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is a model of restraint but dares to tell its story with guts. Thoroughly enjoyable.
6305922756|5.0|This review will only talk about the features included on this DVD.  My review of the movie proper was posted December 1, 2000. <br />---<br />My favourite part of this collection has got to be the animated graphics between the different sections, a shining example of which is the title card for the \\"Special Features\\" section, which emerges from the insides of Derek's trousers wrapped in tin foil.  <br />Running a close second is the audio commentary.  Chris Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer don't do a typical cast commentary.  Instead, they, as their Tap alter egos (Tufnel, St. Hubbins, and Smalls respectively) perform a 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000'-style vivisection on the film, and the people involved in its making.  Director Marty DiBergi is a manipulative backstabber.  Manager Ian Faith is a thief and a liar.  Keyboardist Viv Savage is a drooling buffoon and an unconvincing lip syncher.  Even the boys themselves can't stay out of the way of the pointed barbs (Smalls: \\"Hello!  Yellow Trousers.  What was that idea?\\"  St. Hubbins: \\"Well he [Nigel] had taken up golf.\\").  The track's best running joke:  Every bit player or background extra is thought to have passed on (\\"See the Philipino guy in the background?  He's dead...\\").  Then, typically, when they get to the scene by Elvis' graveside, they quite obviously remark, \\"He's dead\\", before launching into the off-key harmonies of 'Heartbreak Hotel'.  This level of necrophilia shows that after 20 years, as David says, the boys have too much perspective.<br />The commentary is like another mini-film, pasted on top of the original.  Obviously all improvised, it shows that the Tap are still very much in touch with their vivid characters.<br />The rare outtakes section, when watched in one sitting, forms a nice little alternate movie to the original.  There's over an hour's worth of material here, and it's all golden.  But, surprisingly, it's rarely funny.  Rather, we get a different glimpse into the character's lives: Derek (who gets a lot more airtime here) was dealing with the fallout from a messy divorce; we meet David's long lost son; and we see what Nigel was up to during his hiatus from the band.  I found it fascinating, and it furthered my own notion (touched upon in my original review) that the Tap are more than just cartoonish caricatures.  They are meant to be living breathing people with real lives.  The outtakes show this side of them nicely.<br />Additional features include a press conference during the \\"Flower People\\" days that offers Tap's most direct spoofing of the Beatles (Q: \\"How do you find the girls on tour?\\"  A: \\"Turn left at the men\\"), a brief and grainy clip of Tap on the Joe Franklin Show, and three cheesy (pun intended) commercials for some kind of pizza pastry product called \\"Rock and Rolls\\".  All, while not enhancing the movie watching experience in the slightest, are the kind of detailed miscellanea that make Tap so intriguing.
B000002WNP|5.0|Being a bigger fan of 50's Elvis I didn't expect to love this as much, aside from the big hits.  I can't stop listening ........
B00005UEAR|4.0|First of all let's face it , they are not going to make another I&amp;W or another Awake, and that's OK. because they already did these albums. I give this album 4.3 points , it's far better from Scenes from a Memory , and they are trying to mix the new wave of hard music but stay in their prog-vein, maybe the kings of 90' prog metal are the inventors of the prog-metal of this new century (in a good sense). The album is good and has in one song ( song 6 ) double better moments than in the entire SFaM. Disk one in good but different, kind of ethereal , which is good , if they had made another Awake it wouldn't be progressive.<BR>Being a HUGE fan of this band this is my third Choice after I&amp;W and Awake.. hey , even James does not annoy me !! :)
0805062971|5.0|With _Fight Club_, Palahniuk has given us a truly brilliant novel. His writing is edgy, but not abrasive, and the story is dark, but somehow not depressing. I read the book before seeing the movie, and didn't see the film for some time, as I was afraid it wouldn't do the book justice - I was pleasantly surprised, though, and really recommend the movie to anyone who enjoyed the novel (and vice-versa.)<br />On its face, the ideas in this story aren't hugely original - schizophrenia, underground fights, et cetera - but Palahniuk has woven everything into a finished product that is amazingly creative. I can honestly say that I didn't figure out who or how Tyler Durden was until very near the end of the book, and then I had to grin about how cleverly Palahniuk crafted this character. <br />There are portions of the book which are very funny, those which are seriously angry, and those which reach out and grab the reader by the short hairs due to their sheer realism. Then there are the really strange bits, such as the main character's addiction to fatal disease support groups - which gets only weirder as we meet Marla, who is *also* addicted to them; who'd have thought there were two such people in the world? (Answer, Chuck Palahniuk, of course.)<br />Yes indeedy, this novel has it all - explosions, fighting, soap-making, Ikea porn, mustard-collecting, and possibly the downfall of many major credit card corporations. A very entertaining, bizarrely-twisted world.
6305176299|3.0|Reeves seemed to be on depressants the entire movie--the hostages on the bus were far more entertaining and talented than he ever was in this film.  I'm still aghast at how utterly terrible Reeves' acting was.  It defies all comparison, explanation, and comprehension.  <br />I felt immensely sorry for Bullock, having to kiss him and all.  E[...]  I can't believe how popular this movie was.
B00005ARDC|4.0|The 1st. time I listened a BRMC tune I thought it was a brand new Brit band  going back to the roots of Indie guitar rock. It was a surprise when I found Out they were from California. So it seems that finally some bands in America are starting to get the picture on how to play real rock n' roll with creativity and feeling. <br />It is a fact that they sound a lot like different vintage bands from the late 80's and early 90's, but who cares? they took the good stuff out and manage to get a debut record that shows a great potencial.<br />The CD as a whole is a great listen, I bed they sound better on a live gig!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park certainly deserved their Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album speaks volumes. Without even needing to cuss repeatedly or at all, it won over millions of fans. The tracks are supreme compared to the oh-so-boring style of rock music most artists choose to belt out these days. They rock seriously. You'd be missing out on a lot if you don't get this.
B00003CXAA|1.0|I *love* this movie, along with half the planet. However, I have a home projection theatre and the image is projected onto a screen that's about 15 foot diagonal. This is at the limit of what DVD can handle. If you have an excellent transfer -- like The_Matrix or Star Wars I or even Lawrence of Arabia -- its a movie theatre experience. If you have [this] (from the video usually rather than the original master, because its so much cheaper to do it that way) transfer, a great film is ruined (The Last Emporer comes to mind) because VHS is unbearably grainy at that size. Why am I posting this?<br />Yes, they did such a transfer for this classic. My eyes weap to see all the lush richness of Coppola's camera lost. I cannot believe the studio could have been this [way] with a film as visually appealing as any of Coppola's works are.<br />Don't buy it. Don't buy this until they do it right, from the master original. This film deserves better and so do we.
B000053VAF|5.0|This is truely why DVD's were invented in the first place: to take you in and out of the picture. There are more things on the DOGMA SPECIAL EDITION to fill a third testament! One particular part among the many deleted (with cast and crew intros which I believe is a nice touch) is a clip where Jay and Silent Bob do a song and dance that you have to see to believe for yourselves. When I saw the movie on cable, I was so into the story but now when I watch the DVD, the sound effects and Howard Shore's beuatiful music and dialogue that I never heard the first time overwhelm me now. You get not one but two commentaries: a technical one with alot of info on the production and a funny second with Affleck, Smith, Damon, Mewes, and more! Plus, for you lucky few with DVD ROM drives, website links are also available. Snootch to the nootch!
0441003257|5.0|Most science fiction &amp; fantasy readers will kind of tilt their heads like confused puppies at a pairing such as Gaiman &amp; Pratchett - Gaiman is notoriously dark, and Pratchett equally notoriously light-hearted; however, these two have worked together to create an entirely brilliant piece of work.<br />As Clive Barker notes on the cover of this book, &quot;The Apocalypse has never been funnier;&quot; he's totally correct in that assessment. The basic plot is that the Antichrist has been misplaced, and the respective minions of heaven and hell actually find themselves liking people in general, and are somewhat reluctant to bring us all to our demise.<br />There are lines in this book that are so funny, I occasionally had difficulty breathing from laughing too hard; this duo's clever, twisted silliness is just right up my alley. Some of the passages are so wicked, so briliant, they'll leave the reader wiping tears of mirth. Being a fan of much British humor, there was a veritable plethora of chuckles in such references as Milton Keynes, England's highway system, and in the delightful idioms. The idea of heaven and hell being run by beaurocracy is amusing as well.<br />Devout Christian practioners may find this book to be sacreligious, if they are unable to take their religion lightly. Apart from those folks, I'd imagine that most people will really enjoy this book.
B00003CXXP|5.0|It's like this, &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; is based on the 1969 short story, &quot;Super-Toys Last All Summer Long&quot; by Brian Aldiss. &quot;A.I.&quot; somewhat bears its similarities to &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) and was also a long-gestating project of legendary director Stanley Kubrick (&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;). Unfortunately, Kubrick died after his last project &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; was filmed and he passed it along to his friend, director Steven Spielberg (&quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;). &quot;A.I.&quot; was, to me, a very challenging film for Spielberg and also, it was very enjoyable to watch if you look at it very carefully and not worrying about how long the film is, etc. The film's special effects and dazzling scenery was simply amazing, and its cast was very impressive. The film takes place in a future when the polar ice caps have melted and submerged many coastal cities, causing worldwide starvation and human dependence upon robotic assistance. Haley Joel Osment, one of the best young actors today, plays David, the first &quot;mecha&quot;, or robot of the future, designed to experience unconditional love. David is the &quot;son&quot; of grief-stricken Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), and her husband Henry (Sam Robards), an employee of the company that built the boy. David is meant to replace the couple's hopelessly comatose son Martin, but when Martin recovers, David is abandoned and sets out to become &quot;a real boy&quot; worthy of his mother's affection. Along the way, he is befriended and mentored by a streetwise pleasure-providing mecha named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) and a talking &quot;super toy&quot; bear named &quot;Teddy&quot; by his side. David's adventures take him to the Roman Circus-style &quot;Flesh Fair&quot;, where mechas are destroyed for the amusement of humans by its leader, Lord Johnson-Johnson (Brendan Gleeson); Rouge City, where Gigolo Joe narrowly avoids capture by police; and a submerged New York City, where David's creator, Dr. Hobby (William Hurt) reveals the secrets of the boy's creation. In closing, I just have to say that I've been waiting a very long time to see &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;, and that I thought it was a remarkable film to watch. I have to give a lot of credit to Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, and Frances O'Connor for their outstanding performances, especially the character of &quot;Teddy&quot;, who has the most interesting part of this film. I now own the DVD of &quot;A.I.&quot;, with lots of features including behind-the-scenes featurettes, early &quot;Teddy&quot; footage, and much, much more! Like I said, this is the most questionable film of Spielberg's career that you should not ignore the film's accomplishments, but watch and learn from it.<br />P.S. One more thing that I have to ask: &quot;Is this the Steven Spielberg who gave us &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;...or is he a mecha too?&quot;
B00004ZD69|5.0|it's kind of hard to say very much about this album, since it's incredibly hard to describe, and there aren't very many 'individual songs' to write about.<br />to put it simply, there are four tracks streched over 2 cds, 40+ minutes each cd. the noises on this cd can't be defined in words. it's life...it's oblivion...it's everything we see, eat and breath. the noises on this album achieve such staggering beauty as to blow the mind. how can simple words give this album justice? they can't, so you'll just have to listen.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Five college students take a getaway trip to a remote cabin deep within the Tennessee woods. Ash, his girlfriend, his sis, his buddy, and his buddy's girlfriend. The place is eerie and disturbing, and there's something creeping around in and out. While checking out the basement, Ash and his pal find an old book, a dagger, and a tape containing an ancient ritual chant that awakes the Evil Dead! From here on out it's gore and mayhem Sam Raimi style! The kids struggle to stay alive, but things just aren't going their way! And by the end of the film, an unlikely hero is born! You won't know that though, unless you check out the sequels, Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn, and MY personal favorite, Army of Darkness. I liked them so much I dressed as Ash a couple Halloweens ago, and will likely do it again, using this book as a prop next time!<br />  This is just the coolest thing I've seen in a while! I wish more DVD's would go the extra mile the way they did with this one! I must admit, when I first saw this DVD in person I was a bit disappointed because I thought it was supposed to be much bigger, and was worried it would be around regular DVD size. Problem was I was thinking of the way the book was presented in Army of Darkness, I had forgotten that in Evil Dead, it IS around DVD size. Anyways, realizing this upon viewing the movie again, I was quite happy. The case is outstanding! You can see that by the pic. Inside are the actual pages of the Necronomicon, as seen in the trilogy, and the cool thing is that the text CAN be read if you concentrate! There are hidden little phrases throughout, such as \\"Make movies, not war!\\" 10 stars for the case alone baby! As for the disc, another winner! I had this film on VHS, and had been waiting for a definitive DVD before shelling out the cash for one! This is the one to get if you weren't sure which Edition to buy! And buy it now! At 29.99 it is a tad over priced, but from what I have read the price is only going to go up! Anyway, back to the disc, it contains the trailer and TV spots, a still/poster gallery, two commentaries, one by Bruce Campbell, which is hilarious, and one by writer and director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, which is watchable, there's an outtakes real that I admit I didn't find all that great, a fan documentary done by Bruce Campbell (awesome!), a short film of interviews about trying to get the movie made, and I have no idea if I'm leaving something out! The film itself is a classic of course, and it's great to see it in widescreen on DVD quality! I remember the first time I saw it, back in high school, and it scared me to death! The sequels just get better and better too! Do yourself a favor and pick it up before it's gone! And if after viewing all 3 films, you're itching for part four, grab \\"Evil Dead:Hail to the King\\" for the Playstation video game system.to the disc, it contains the trailer and TV spots, a still/poster gallery, two commentaries, one by Bruce Campbell, which is hilarious, and one by writer and director Sam Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, which is watchable, there's an outtakes real that I admit I didn't find all that great, a fan documentary done by Bruce Campbell (awesome!), a short film of interviews about trying to get the movie made, and I have no idea if I'm leaving something out!

B00005QDW1|4.0|What can I say, I love this album. I would have given it 5 starts, but there are two song on the album, that I do not like.  From what i can unsderstand from the previous reviews, the people who gave \\"Rock Steady\\", bad reviews are people who are die-hard No-Doubt fans, and they feel let down by the material on this album.  <BR>Well I love No-Doubt, but I am also a person of ecclectic taste, and i found the songs covered in \\"Rock Steady\\", to be beautiful.  They did a wonderful job with the combination of reagge, dance hall, 80's synth-pop, and rock.  I definitely, like this album more than \\"Return To Saturn\\", which I tought was a real dissapointment.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Well, Jeepers Creepers is truly and utterly horrorfying if I may say so myself! I mean, just the thought of getting trapped down in that dark tunnel surrouned by dozens of naked sewed bodies together...ugh! Just the thought it gives me the creeps! (If you have seen the movie, you'd know what I am talking about.)<br />Anyways, the movie Jeepers Creepers, is about two kids on their way back home from college, Darry and Trish.  But when then unexpectedly come across a mysterious pipe out in the middle of no where, that is next to an old abandond church.  When  the teens drive by, they notice a strange guy dropping *dead* bodies into the pipe covered with blood stains.<br />After about five minutes into the film, we see an excellent dull moment with the Old Truck and the kids.  The soundtrack and camera angles are so wonderful well done, that it sent chills up and down my spine.<br />Victor Salva is a wonderful director who knows what he's doing, and has casted a brilliant cast.<br />I'm proud of this movie for several reasons,<br />1.) It sticks to it's genre.<br />2.) You don't see too many horror flicks that stick with it's genre.<br />3.) And with the right score and directing, you get it a bone chilling treat!<br />Thanks Victor for making this film a success! It keeps you entertained from frame one 'till the very last one.  Jeepers Creepers is a must have for those who love a good scare.
0786225955|4.0|If you enjoyed the movie based on _Girl, Interrupted_, you will likely enjoy the book even more, as it goes much deeper inside Kaysen's thoughts and feelings, and spends more time on each character in general. Kaysen does a fantastic job of describing how she felt during her stay at McLean Hospital; her prose is highly-descriptive, with an almost poetic feel to some of the passages.<br />For some reason, one bit replays itself in my head, even when I haven't read this book for some time: <br />&quot;Oh Valerie,&quot; I said, &quot;you promised --&quot; Then the Thorazine hit me. It was like a wall of water, strong but soft...My legs and feet felt like mattresses, they were so huge and dense. Valerie and Georgina felt like mattresses too, big soft mattresses pressing on either side of me. It was comforting.&quot;<br />As she explores the depths of her psyche, she often uses dark humor, which is a very effective tool. The tactics she and other patients used to manipulate the hospital staff are often brilliant, sometimes poignantly sad. Kaysen's unflinching description of the sociopathic Lisa feels dead-on; the reader simultaneously loves and hates her, and agonizes with Kaysen as her worship of Lisa leads to disappointment again and again.<br />I've read this book several times, and will read it again in the future - it's an often dark, often inspiring look at the mental hospitals of the sixties, and at the nature of the human mind. Kaysen spares us no detail when describing her own disorder and behavior, or the disorders and behaviors of others.<br />A very frank book, and an excellent read.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm glad a friend told me about these guys about a year before they hit the mainstream, they combine a good rock/hard rock mix with some rap and singing. If you've heard and liked \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"In the End\\" both really good songs, you'll like it the whole cd is like that. It's a really good cd, my advice buy it.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I never used to be a big fan of war movies, and even avoided them like the plague because I felt they portrayed the soldiers as arrogent, cocky, warriors who had big egos and GI Joe mentalities.  Until Saving Private Ryan and some of the more recent war movies, did Hollywood finally produce a war movie with a real storyline filled with raw and realistic emotion.  This movie is definitely worthy of that caliber!  Mel Gibson does an incredible job of portraying a real life hero, who is down-to-earth, courageous, and actually very believable and humble.  No big egos here!  These are real men with real fears, real emotion, and real brotherhood.  They fought for America and their President, only to find out they really were fighting for each other.  A nation turned against them, their Commander-in-Chief deceived them, and the only honor they had was the courage they faced on the battlefield.  The stunning performances only enhance the incredible storyline by giving the viewer a real sense of what the Vietnam War was really all about.  While many Americans turned their backs on the veterans of this horrific war, there is a story - about real people with real lives, and real emotions that needed to be told.  It's long overdue, and highly regarded.  This movie tells a story.  It reminds us that there is more to a great war movie than just killing, guts, and blood.  Definitely Oscar worthy!!  It deserves Best Picture and Best Actor for Mel Gibson!!  You'll have to see it twice just to experience and understand it all.
B00000J8EK|5.0|Do not hesitate to buy this CD.  If you've heard that the Chemical Brothers went downhill after Dig Your Own Hole, than you have been talking to the wrong people.  True, Surrender lacks the &quot;made for radio&quot; sound that the Grammy-winning D.Y.O.H. had, but if you like the 'Brothers style, you will not be disappointed in the least.<br />This album starts off with a bang, and, save for it's RARE meandering moments, delivers a great ride all the way to the end.  Track one, Music: Response, is my idea of perfect electronica, and the following tracks are as acidic as you please, with plenty of beeps and bloops and electronic-gadgets-working noises.  This is great Big Beat for people who want to know what great Big Beat sounds like.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is a seductive film. But underneath the grandiose visuals, the classic acting, and the macho fight scenes, lies a disturbing question.<br />\\"Remind me why we're here?\\" the aging emperor Marcus Aurelius asks his favorite general and heir designate, Maximus, at the end of a long and bloody campaign against German barbarians. \\"For the glory of Rome\\" replies Maximus, displaying a soldier's instinctive loyalty but also a dangerous naivete. For Maximus has never even been to Rome, and as Marcus Aurelius is quick to point out, the general's loyalty is misplaced -- Rome has become corrupt, and its wars are driven by baser motives than glory.<br />Thus begins \\"Gladiator\\", an epic tragedy that is rooted in the bloodthirsty expansionism of the Roman empire, but also in Maximus' fatal refusal to confront the danger of imperial politics and the homicidal egos of his masters. <br />The very contradiction embodied in Maximus, is this: he is at heart a farmer and a loving family man, yet he has left his home in order to serve the Roman army, wherein he has become a ruthless, efficient killing machine. He is an instrument of destruction and enslavement of foreign people whose only fault, after all, is a stubborn desire to remain free of Rome -- the very freedom that Maximus secretly wants for himself.<br />This deep moral pit requires a brutally painful expiation process. Maximus is condemned to undergo a personal odyssey -- from general to fugitive to slave to gladiator to hero -- not just to recapture his dignity, but also to pay penance for having so long lived by the sword. <br />Maximus however is blind to his own fault in all this; he only sees himself as a wronged party. And so the cost to his soul is redoubled. He loses his beloved family, his home, his freedom, his life, and he comes close to losing his very humanity in a succession of grisly gladiatorial arenas.<br />In the end, Maximus does vanquish his personal foes, but can find freedom and rest only in death...But instead the director chose to keep the focus of \\"Gladiator\\" on personal heroics. In the absence of a religious denouement, the film's finale is bursting with sadness. \\"Gladiator\\" serves not only as awesome entertainment, but also as a moral warning against  the awful banality of violence and the vicious cycle of personal revenge.
0783226063|5.0|This is one of the ultimate sci fi movies ever made. Frank Herbert wrote an excellent novel, and this movie is true to it. The visual effects, costumes, and sets are teriffic. The cast is superb! Kyle McLaughlin and Sting are great advesaries. I can watch this movie any time. It great on a good computer DVD drive too!
0553275569|5.0|At first, this book looked ok. When I started to read it I really got an interest in the Space Race Era. This is a great book for any person who has a slight bit of interest in Space.
B00005QXXO|5.0|Absolutely brilliant.  Radiohead's live recording affords them the opportunity to experiment with and jazz up several of their already-terrific tracks.  In fact, several of the songs that were less than stellar become first rate when given the live treatment by Thom Yorke and etc.  From the harsher and more aggressive National Anthem to the warped Idioteque to the finale of True Love Waits, this album simply rocks with all the paranoid fury you'd expect from Radiohead.  The first seven songs are representative of Radiohead's latest post-mental-breakdown techno/experimental wasteland phase of Kid A and Amnesiac, all done brilliantly, while the final cut on the album is perhaps the best - a ballad quite remniscent of High and Dry or Fake Plastic Trees from The Bends.  All in all, the only complain one could possibly have is why there's only forty-odd minutes of live music here.  Superb.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This is no doubt the best soundtrack ever. This album was part of one of the best movies ever made as well.
B00003CXXP|1.0|How can you people even give this movie 4-5 stars. Come on the plot was choppy and the flow of the movie was slow. The kid wandered aimlessly. The conclusion is ridiculous, especially the way things are reolved. The last disasterous movie of this magnitude for Spielberg was 1941.<BR>My advice is rent the DVD at BlockBluster. If you like it, buy it. If not then you've saved [money] or spared yourself the annoyance of trying to sell this [stuff] on ebay to recoup your losses.
0451198670|1.0|I enjoyed Alice in Bed years ago and thought I'd like this one -- I had to force myself to finish it.  I found both Helen and Johnny totally uninteresting and very hard to believe.  Completely pointless and boring -- the first 100 pages were the hardest to get through.  I can only imagine how bad the movie must be!
B00005R2M3|4.0|I did not like this album after the first time I listened. However, the second and the third time - well, it kind of grows on you! <BR>Songs are not monotone or same as everything else out there. <BR>I believe this is a good buy and would recommend it. <BR>Also recommend &quot;ESCAPE&quot; if you're buying this album.
B00000AF98|1.0|This is definitely my least favorite Kiss album. The mid to late 80's was a weird time for Kiss, as they tried to sound like all of the other hair metal bands that were popular at that time, like Cinderella, Bon Jovi, etc. Their albums continued to sell very well...all of them went either Gold or Platinum, but they didn't deserve to, seeing how bad the music was.<br /><br />Gene Simmons was still in the band, but only physically...his mind seemed to be everywhere else. His songs on most of the Kiss albums after \\"Creatures of the Night\\" were amongst his worst ever. I can't recommend or even remember the songs that Gene contributed to \\"Crazy Nights\\". That left Paul Stanley to pick up the slack and unfortunately, most of his songs weren't that memorable this time around either. Or, if they were memorable, like the horrible title track, one wishes they weren't! This was Kiss doing Eighties pop hair metal and if I didn't jump ship with Asylum( though I wanted to!), I definitely did this time. I mean, when the best song on a Kiss album is a BALLAD( \\"Reason To Live\\"), you know you're in trouble.<br /><br />When listening to this album again sometime last year, the thing that bothered me the most was Eric Carr's boring, unadventurous 4/4 metal drumming. Carr( may he rest in peace) was easily my least favorite Kiss drummer.Guitarist Bruce Kulick was technically very proficient, but he was all about flash and notes, not feel. He was also not much of a songwriter.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Nights\\" is very much a Kiss album in terms of lyrics, which deal with partying, hanging out with lots of naked women when you're not breaking up with them, etc... It's a very happy album, I guess, though it doesn't cheer me up at all.<br /><br />I can't recommend it!
B00005JKL8|5.0|This movie has a great plot, tense situations, and unbelieveable cinamentography (I don't know if I spelled that right).  Any way, this is a great war movie that I highly recomend to people who like to watch movies without the possibility of Dozing.  Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman do a [great] job in this one of a kind film!
B000002J0N|5.0|I have had their debut and Deja-vu with neil young and 4way street all on vinyl since they were first released. In the past couple of years I replaced the vinyl with remastered cd's, it was only 'till today that I obtained a copy of CSN. Man this is so great and new to my ears needlessly for the past 25 yrs! Shame on me. If you have made the same mistake and passed this cd by than don't delay, it is fantastic. The vocals are so unbelievably strong and the music, dare I say it, the best they ever did or have done since. It is one very strong cd and it is a CSN essential.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|normally, when listening to any CD, whether it is a soundtrack or not you can find yourself skipping over songs. I rate this CD as an official no skipping songs CD. You can't miss a song, and once u pop it in, you don't wanna leave it play and not be in hearing distance.<BR>I loved the movie, it was artistically stunning, but until listening to all the songs on another friends CD, I wouldnt have bought it. Its worth the money. <BR>I havent gotten to the 2nd version of it yet, but i cant wait for it.
B00003CXI1|2.0|To start I would like to say that this movie had the posibility of being a clasic, with such a fantastic script, and nearly universaly popular subject matter, Warner Bros. can't go wrong. Right? HA! Anticipation of this movie was palpable among Harry Potter readers. Fanatics stood in lines for hours (I regret to say I was among them). Once the movie started cheers arose from the crowd, oh so eagarly awaiting thier magical fix. But like many others I was forced to cringe, gasp and groan at the attrosities and aborations that was inflicted upon this posible gem. I am shocked by their casting choises. I'm sorry Danniel Radcliffe, but you suck deary. He was posibly the worst actor on the screen I have ever had the dismay of being subjected to. Radcliffe's monotonous, dry and juvinile acting skills litteraly murdered the character of Harry.  Not to leave out Chris Colombus's directing. *shudder* But not all the charecters were as terrifyingly terrible as poor Harry. Maggie Smith's portrayal of Minerva McGonnagal was a pure delight, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasly was exceptional (especialy next to his counterpart). Believe me I had the biggest expectations for this movie *sigh* but, there are some things in life one simply can't deny.
B000001FSP|5.0|...<br />No one was prepared for the transformation of Marianne Faithfull's innocent flower child image. The \\"Broken English\\" Marianne was a snarling, black leather punk spewing vitriol at all that was sacred about the 60's. Her voice had dropped to a smoky and seductive alto, ravaged by the scars of age and excess. It may have served as a footnote to her career, but Marianne Faithfull's naked honesty was so compelling that it resembled the brooding poetry of Baudelaire's \\"Flowers of Evil.\\" Producer Angelo Badalamenti captured just the right amount sylish Euro-pop electronics to compliment Marianne's husky rasps. ... In the song \\"Why D'Ya Do It\\", Marianne rages at an unfaithful boyfriend with just about every epithet unsuitable for use in \\"polite\\" society. \\"Lucy Jordan\\" is a despairing ballad of a 37 year old housewife who realizes that she will never fulfill her dream of \\"riding through Paris, in a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair.\\" The heartfelt cover of John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\" resculpts the song into a cry of the doomed outsider, as effective as Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall.\\" The  high point of the album is \\"Guilt\\" where Marianne's simmering resentment of feeling guilt becomes a self-exorcism her own victimization by drugs, fame and fortune. \\"Broken English\\" is a turning point for both Marianne Faithfull and the context of popular music in 1979. \\"Broken English\\" was tremendously influential in laying the ground-work for a generation of young female musicians to strip away the transparent sheen from modern sexual relationships and speak frankly about bedroom politics.
B000001EG6|5.0|This was an excellent album when first released and now that is remastered, which is superb, it is even more beautiful than ever. It's the kind of easy listen that lets your mind produce images and you find yourself falling into those thoughts. This is mostly an easy listening/soft rock/folky kind of album and if you get off on piano... your in heaven. Although Elton/Taupin have done some great work throughout the years IMHO they never surpassed this album.
B00004U2NX|4.0|The main reason I am writing this review is that this English version is not, in fact dubbed!  The every scene in the movie was shot twice, first in German, and then in English.  Those are the actual voices of Kinski and Adjani, et al.  However, when the two versions were tested on audiences, English speakers found the English version a little too odd.  So this is actually, in a sense, another movie.  I agree with many other reviewers appreciation of the beauty and creepiness of the movie.  It took me a couple of viewings to adjust to the oddities of the English version, but I still like it.  The German version is a little better.
B000001DQG|5.0|Reviewer JohnKwok is mistaken,this is not the worst Elton album from this period,Rock of the westies is. JohnKwok is not qualified to say what the worst Elton album is.His review means nothing.Zilch.Zero.Buy this CD and enjoy it inspite of JohnKwok!
B0000399WI|5.0|What can I say! This movie is purely one of the best I have ever seen. Put it this way, it if wasn't for Forrest Gump, this movie would have easily won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture(they both came out the same year). Plain and simple a must see movie with a fantastic storyline and life learning lessons that will stick with you forever. I have seen it over 10 times and plan on seeing it some more.
0553573403|1.0|The first few pages are great, then the story stalls.  I couldn't even finish it because it bored me to tears. I kept waiting for there to be some sort of action but it NEVER happens even more than halfway through the book. Maybe the end is great, but I'll never know because I can bare how slow it moves.
0743204018|5.0|One of my favourite books. Mr. McCourt brings tenderness and humor out of the dark and challenge of life. Tis' is essentially the story of an immigrant and his new life in New York City. Beginning with his voyage to America, the autobiographical story follows his struggle to make it in a country that isn't always accepting of strangers. Don't be mistaken to think of this as an extension of the dark tone of Angela's Ashes (which I also liked). I found this book much lighter in tone and more optimistic. McCourt finds his way to the promised land and has to deal with the realities of American society. It's full of the irony of everyday life and his struggles for education, happiness, love, and acceptance. Yes Mr. McCourt is an Irish immigrant, but it's not soley about his being Irish in America. If anything, it's about his struggle to be an American.
B00003XAVA|5.0|Erikthewise`s review is useless.Every track on this CD is good.Buy it,and enjoy EVERY track,inspite of Erikthewise`s unqualified review.Enjoy!
B000002KET|3.0|Let me start by saying that this album's title track (a righteous guitar grind accompanied by a pounding rhythym section and Ozzy's insane wail) ranks among Sabbath's best songs.  Even Tony Iommi has admitted that he belives that tune to be Sabbath's finest.  Although I wouldn't quite go that far, it certainly is good. <BR>The rest of the album, unfortunately, pales in comparison.  Sabbra Cadabra, Killing Yourself To Live, and A National Acrobat are decent, but nothing special.  Fluff seems like a directionless imitation of Vol. 4's Laguna Sunrise, and Spiral Architect is too light and airy to make a lasting impression.<BR>This is not to say that Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a bad album; the band's playing is still tight and Ozzy's vocals remain powerful and inspired.  It's just not up to par with any of Sabbath's previous releases or the following album, Sabotage.
B000003BES|5.0|Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) is an adequate assimilation of some of the Stones' greatest tunes before their music entered a very dark, antisocial phase during the peak of the Vietnam War. <br />At the start, you have their trademark song (I Can't Get No)Satisfaction, which many rank right up there with the Beatles' Hey Jude and Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven as being the greatest rock-and-roll song of all time. In between are the pensive As Tears Go By and the reflective blues number Good Times Bad Times. Also present are the favorites 19th Nervous Breakdown and what many consider to be the Stones' proclamation of supreme status as the greatest rock band ever in Get Off of My Cloud.<br />At the very end is the soft yet ominous Play with Fire, which, with its unique arrangement of harpsichord, acoustic guitar and tambourine, commanded that the Stones, whether in hard rock or soft rock mode, could show attitude and get a message across.<br />It is a very strong compilation. The only objection one might have is the organ intro version of Time Is On My Side, which seems to gel with the other tunes quite well, as opposed to the guitar one that is played on the oldies stations. <br />Five stars to this Rolling Stones piece of history.
B00005NZJX|5.0|This cd is everything one would want.  The songs are awesome.  It just blows u away.  buy it!
B00004Z3WP|5.0|Review<br />Krokus <BR>Head Hunter 1983 <BR>Official Review <BR>Although it seems as though Krokus has stolen shamelessly from Kiss, Judas Priest, Motorhead, AC/ DC, and Ted Nugent on this release, it does have some good cuts. I can't resist the hit \\"Long Stick Goes Boom \\";  or \\"Eat The Rich\\" . In \\"Screaming In the Night\\" Krokus are probably going for more of a rock thing than  metal, but my favorite cuts are \\"Ready To Burn\\" and \\"Russian Winter\\".  Head Hunter\\" also features \\"Night Patrol\\", \\" Stay Awake All Night\\", a Judas Priestish party anthem, and \\"Stand and Be Counted\\". I think this album is total heavy metal. I think it's sort of plastic, but it does have some good songs. If you're thinking of getting a Krokus album get this one it's probably best listened to when driving in you're car down a highway with the radio turned up. This album has a lot of good songs and sometimes the best kind of music isn't heavy polemics, or Satanism it's just good time beer drinkin music like  Krokus. If you're not a heavy metal fan then keep the hell away, but if you're a Krokus fan then be adequately prepared to rock. Elders stay away, but young hell raisers come one come all and listen to the music of Krokus. I think this is the best Krokus album.
B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath's self-titled album accurately set the standard for what was to follow in their muscially career.  The album's opening track (an ominous depiction of an encounter with a demonic spectre) is about as quintessential as it gets; no wonder why the band was able to garner so much religious atttention so quickly.  Truthfully, none of the band members worshipped Satan (in fact, the inverted cross indside the album's cover was the record label's idea, not that of Iommi, Ozzy, Butler, or Ward), but the record was still frightening enough to suggest that.<BR>Surprisingly, this is Sabbath's most bluesy album.  Influences like Cream and Blue Cheer are evident in both The Wizard (which features an insanely engaging harmonica line and some simple but cool lyrics) and N.I.B. (in which the riff from Cream's Sunshine of Your Love is clipped and played on a heavily distorted guitar).  Some other tracks drag a bit, but this problem would diminish with time, namely after the release of Paranoid.<BR>Overall, this is an enjoyable introduction to the Sabbath canon.  Over thirty years after its release, it still holds up as an immensely daring and influential recording.
B000002UA9|4.0|Please Please Me was the debut of a group who would revolutionize the world of popular music throughout the 1960's. The Beatles and George Martin began what would be world dominance of the sales charts for almost six years nonstop. <br />Some may wonder just how the Beatles' sudden popularity was possible and how it came to endure; in response, one might say that there are two key reasons: 1. Elvis was virtually out of sight and 2. Listeners were becoming tired of the doo wop sounds that were permeating the air waves before 1964 and were thus ready for a change.<br />Though their songwriting skills were at the early stages of development, the Beatles knew right off the bat how to make a record an enjoyable listen. P.S. I Love You and the self-titled track, though lyrically simple, were charged with energy, feeling and emotion and were also two of the numbers that established the up tempo portions of this release. The slower but equally pleasant songs consisted of There's a Place and the #1 hit Love Me Do.<br />Though the pace and the sequence of the tunes were arguably haphazard, Please Please Me was nonetheless put together well enough to be considered as groundbreaking, for the atmosphere of the music scene created by the Beatles at the time would evolve and eventually lead to the refinement of the Fab Four's instrumentations and songwriting abilities for years to come.<br />Since the release is just over 30 minutes, it is far too short. If it had been compiled into a two volumes in one disc with With the Beatles a la the re-releases of the Beach Boys catalog, then there would have been a solid 5-star rating.
B00003CX5P|2.0|hi all , ,well the only good thing about this dvd is that the actual documentary which shows us the story behind the movie.perfectly made!!!!!!!now the movie itself? well i saw star wars when i was 6 1/2 years old and i loved it ,good characters nice story line,iloved even more empire strike back even if it was more dramatic,iwas 12years old then came \\"return\\" were i find it a litle too cheesy , it should have been a warning of things to come......<BR>anyhow i was with the other milions waiting eagerly for the prequel and when i got out of the theater i was fuming.<BR>this movie is a insult to all children and beyond,it seems now lucas thinks that a child can not apreciate a good movie if it has strong character even controversial (han solo)or a bit of drama (empire)instead he gives us likes of Jar Jar bings which is a huge waiste of money brings nothing good to the movie.<BR>the actors  can't act ,very bland.the only thing good are the special effects but that alone does not bring a movie to greatness.i expected lucas to have some respect towards the old generation of fans which brougth him were he is in the first place but he failed dearly.hes next project should be at least better then the toddler movie he gave us 2 years ago and if its a dude i wont feel sorry for him.
B00003CXTG|1.0|As the Japanese approach Pearl Harbor, they pass over a woman doing her laundry and families at a little league game.  We then cut to the men at Pearl, and they are all still asleep. How could Military men be asleep while entire families are out at a ball game? (Unless this ball game started at 4 AM, this is blatant  ignorance.)  The answser is: there was no ball game.  It's a silly shot made by silly people for silly audiences.<br />Later, our heroes wake up the morning of the attack in the back of a car.  They wear civilian clothing and drive a civilian car.  And here come the Japs, no longer interested in Military bases.  Now a squadron of Japs chases the civilian car, which apparantly holds civilians inside. (This is blatant ignorance.  The Japanese didn't attack civilians.)  Our heroes then run and run and run and, not even out of breath, they arrive at the airfield shouting \\"Get me a plane, get me a plane.\\"  <BR>Cut to:  Interior Hospital.  Chaos.  Blood.   And here come our heroes down the hall: <BR>\\"What do you need\\"  <BR>\\"We need blood.\\" <BR>\\"OK, Take ours.\\"  <BR>CUT TO: men trapped inside a sinking boat.  They are reaching their hands up through a grate towards other men who are trying to free them.  And here come our heroes, across the boat and up to the drowning men, offering any help they can.  Weren't they just in a civilian vehichle? Weren't they just at the airfield?  Weren't they just at the hospital?  What are they doing here on the boat?  Next comes our heroes in a dog fight, then comes our heroes in the Doolittle Raid; and onward.<br />I believe anyone who liked this movie is ignorant, naiive, uneducated, or too young to get it.<br />And Josh Hartnett is the worst actor who ever lived.
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality represents Black Sabbath reaching their creative peak.  The production, although compressed, fits in perfectly with the gloomy atmosphere and hard-hitting lyrics.  And although everyone tends to focus solely on Sweet Leaf or Children of the Grave for the standout track, all of the songs hold up incredibly well.<BR>After Forever, Into the Void, and Lord of this World are all excellent tracks that are every bit as good as the previously mentioned ones. Solitude is also very good.  It shows Sabbath moving in a more reflective, quiet direction (a direction that would become fully formed by the time Vol. 4 was completed), and doing so very well.  The only qustionable track is Orchid, which sounds strangley rushed and incomplete.<BR>This album shows the best sides of Sabbath-there are still some psychadaelic tinges to the music (although less apparent than those found in Paranoid or the self-title), along with engaging, insightful lyrics (particularly on After Forever) and thunderous playing by Butler, Ward, and Iommi.  If you have even a slight interest in the roots of heavy metal, listen to this album-you will definitely enjoy it.
B00003CXXP|4.0|okay,I know you think:sci-fi movie,right?WRONG!!!!!!!!This movie may be about androids,but its really about,well,life...The story is incredible,but at the same time its dull,Its basically the story of Pinocio,You know wooden boy who wants to be real...Par of that is because in the movie his \\"mother\\" reads him the story of Pinocio,and when he's abandoned he searches for tha Blue fairy to make him real so that his \\"Mother\\" will love him,and like Pinocio he gets hooked up with some pretty shady characters...That's all I'll tell,You should watch this movie and make-up Your mind if You like it or not.....I recomend it!
B000002B1M|4.0|Now that years have passed on this album, I can appreciate it much more.  Gems such as: \\"The Message\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"Nas Is Coming\\", \\"Watch Dem Niggas\\", and \\"Suspect\\" made this album truly a great follow-up to the timeless classic ILLMATIC.  Let's break it down on why the lyrical prowess of Nas is so incredible.  For example, \\"I Gave You Power\\" has Nas rapping from the aspect of a gun.  Not even Hova(or any rapper for that matter) was advanced enough to think of something on that level at that time.  Then here comes \\"Suspect\\", which I call the \\"lost\\" ILLMATIC track.  This track was a heavy throw-back to ILLMATIC, Nas comes equipped with the vivid lyrics that gave him the title as being the \\"Second Rakim\\" in the first place.  While L.E.S.'s beat brings the 94' flavor that made Nas's flow sound even more vicious.  True it was evident that Nas no longer wanted to be Nasty and cross over to a larger scale of success, but it was good to see that he still had the heart of a street disciple.
B00000637V|1.0|With lyrics like \\"In Berlin, by the wall, you were [ I can no longer remember the exact measure, let's say ] 5 foot, 6 inches tall\\", or the equally banal \\"Since she lost her daughter, it's her eyes that flow with water\\" -  the listener should immediately sense trouble. Because when we finally hear the daughter start to scream  -  by the way, was it \\"daughter\\" singular, or \\"daughters\\" plural? there seem to be lots of 'em wailing in here - we know we've arrived solidly in the dark, airless basement of unadulterated, manipulative kitsch. And it gets worse: you'd better force yourself to nod knowingly during \\"Sad Song\\". If you laugh, giggle or snicker at the formula string arrangements you'll simply ruin it for the rest of us.<br /><br />Together with its grade-school lyrics and haunting lack of imagination, \\"Berlin\\" delivers a degree of pretension exceeded only by the more recent \\"Drella\\".  What can I say? \\"Berlin\\" is easily as dumb as that other period trainwreck, ELP's \\"Tarkus\\". While the music is clearly unrelated, the two are joined by the vast and growing scale of their respective failures. Recall with me the appropriately weepy Moog that ushers us to the tear-filled end of ELP's pretend monster. ***Sigh*** I can't help but also remember the artifice of emotions bathing \\"Berlin\\" and shed a tear, too, for \\"The Kids\\".<br /><br />\\"Berlin\\" is little more than a sometimes clever artist straining beyond all credulity. The album and ideas are pat, shallow and the whole thing tends to mope rather than reach any true depth of feeling. Skip it in favor of  \\"Transformer\\" and join Joel and the bots on the Satellite of Love.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Disney has finally released this amazing cult classic in a collection that film enthusiasts can enjoy having!  The picture and sound quality of the film itself is outstanding - probably the best you'll ever see for this movie - and the colors jump right off of the screen.  There are no additional scenes re-incorporated into the film, but there are rough prints of two deleted sequences on the extras disk that comes along with the collection.  Don't miss the many special featruettes on how the animation and special effects were done originally - it was a lot more work back in 1982 - and check out all of the animated menus on both dvd disks.  There is a single dvd available to the market, but the sound isn't as good and it doesn't have any of the special features.  Don't wait until this filk goes &quot;out of print&quot; and &quot;into the vault&quot; - re-live the light cycle adventure today!
B00003CXUM|5.0|This dvd is loaded with features i.e. deleted scences and commentary. If you are looking for more background on the movie this is the one to pick up. This also features interviews with WKW, Maggie and Tony.
6305537798|5.0|I loved this movie and it gives a very acurate reprensentation of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. The characters in this movie nail their parts so well.
B00005LMBK|4.0|The Gorillaz CD is well crafted, and well performed. If you aren't into music with a fairly high silliness factor, don't bother (though if that's the case, AND you're thinking about buying a CD \\"made\\" by cartoon characters...). Everyone involved does a great job on the CD, though there are a couple of slow-spots.<BR...
B00005QATY|5.0|I think people who give this movie one star are the same people giving rave reviews to Kenny G albums.<br />This is a beautifully created, quirky movie, with brilliant performances, and great humor.<br />The people who called this movie boring fall into one or both of the following categories:`<BR>1) They never read &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and so all of the very witty references and jokes are lost on them<BR>2) They just don't get subtle humor<br />This contains some slapstick humor, yes.  However, hidden under this are subtle nods to Homer's epic poem, along with both witty and very dark humor (the Ku Klux rally is too funny for words, but you feel bad laughing).<br />Ignore the bad reviews.  Read the Odyssey, buy this soundtrack, and see this movie!  Unless you're a stupid person, then don't waste your time.
B000002IGP|4.0|I don't think this is the best ratt album out there, but it is certainly good.  It is slightly more homogeneous than their other albums, and I think this is because the whole album culminates into &quot;Round and Round,&quot; which is a great song.  However, the best song is &quot;The Morning After&quot; which has a Zepplinesque drum beat.  The reason I don't give this 5 stars is because there are some weak songs here which don't belong such as &quot;She wants money&quot; and &quot;in your direction.&quot;  &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot; is also a bitter song and ends the album on a sour note.  Nonetheless, the remaining songs make this a good disc.
B00005NWM3|5.0|The first time I heard Nickelbacks &quot;you remind me&quot; I knew this was a cd I just had to own. After purchaseing the cd, I did not even wait until I got home to take it out, and put it in. Popping it into the cd player in my car, I had to listen to &quot;you remind me&quot; before moving on to the rest of the cd.<BR>&quot;Never Again&quot; is a song about domestic violence. If you have ever been in an abusive situation, or known someone that has you will find this song to be aggressive and very descriptive. Overall, not my favorite song on the cd but not the worst either.<BR>Of course my personal favorite &quot;how you remind me&quot; is the best break up song ever recorded. The song has alot to say about what you go through when you break up. From anger, to disbelief, to sadness, and of course blame. <BR>&quot;Too Bad&quot; is my second favorite song on the cd just because I personally have expiernced a falling out with a parent. If you ever get a chance to see the video, you will see that it ties in well with the song and kind of explains how and why they wrote it and recorded it. <BR>After those three songs, the rest is just noise. They all sound okay, but they just arn't as good as the first part of the cd. I would recommend this just because I have it in my cd player 3 or 4 days a week.<BR>A must buy if you like music with a message.
1573220485|5.0|I saw the movie first before reading this book. While the movie was great, the book is even better (but that's usually always the case, isn't it?).<br />The original details of Garland's story are even more absorbing than what the producers edited for the film version. <br />For example, Richard gets the girl Francoise in the film and the result understandably causes Etienne to get upset. In the book, though, Richard never gets her--he's attracted to her, sure, but he bends over backwards to *not* go anywhere with her or even give the impression of being tempted. That's because Richard is a lot less selfish in the original novel and grows to be a close friend of Etienne's without all of the constant arguing they do in the movie, and his desire to be sure he doesn't even accidentally hurt Etienne's feelings over Francoise is much more emotionally effective, genuinely touching and easier for readers to relate to.<br />The scene with the whole camp getting sick, though, is much more understandable concerning its being edited out--it wouldn't work too well in a film.<br />The ending is far, far more disturbing than even the original film--I was genuinely surprised by it. But it ends the book as a whole on a much more haunting note while still ringing true.<br />A great read and definitely worth your time and money!
B00005UQ9F|4.0|Brad Anderson's moody, dark thriller Session 9 is a brilliant exercise in what horror films should be.  Two parts mood and one part acting, the film is devoid of blood, ghost-story clich&eacute;s like psychics and other such mumbo-jumbo, and even the \\"force\\" itself.  It's an experiment that works and works astonishingly well, evoking classics like \\"The Haunting of Hill House\\" (which later became the basis for the wonderfully gothic 1963 movie and the awful 1999 remake) and \\"Rebecca.\\"  Session 9 is also unique because it involves a group of blue-collar, normal, every-day Joes, something you don't usually see in cinema much, let alone horror films.<br />The action follows Gordon and his Hazmat Cleanup crew.  Their job is to turn the Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts (a real, closed mental institution, it is worth noting, and the admitted inspiration for Lovecraft's infamous Arkham Asylum) from a health risk into a habitable building, and to do so in a week.  The prize: a $10000 bonus that each worker really needs.  But things begin to get in the way: personal conflicts between the workers, Gordon's less-than-perfect home life, a room full of files that contain recordings of various \\"sessions\\" with a psychotic patient, and... something else.<br />Like other good horror movies, the fear is built not from things jumping out at the characters, but the sense of dread that slowly builds throughout the movie until the gut-tightening crescendo at the end.  Credit goes three places for this: the actors, who manage to portray their descent with striking realism; the Hospital itself, with its rotting walls, rusted clocks, and abandoned wheelchairs and medical apparatuses; and the cinematographers, who skew each shot just subtly enough to create a sense of paranoid and \\"being watched.\\"<br />The supernatural force - if it exists at all - never makes an appearance, and there is nothing that jumps out at the characters to scare them.  Instead, Session 9 offers such a sense of claustrophobia and impending doom that it stays with you long after you shut the lights off, which is what horror films are supposed to do.  The only complaints about this DVD aren't from the movie, but from its presentation: there's no anamorphic widescreen (it's letterboxed), and the sound, while good, is not presented in a 5.1 digital or DTS track.  In this day and age, it's almost a crime to not present a movie in anamorphic widescreen, especially a movie as great as this.  The DVD is still worth the purchase; I bought it \\"blind\\" (without seeing the movie) and was very impressed.rophobia and impending doom that it stays with you long after you shut the lights off, which is what horror films are supposed to do.

0714834491|5.0|It's not so much a read as an experience. Beautifully put together, beyond exhaustive in scope and information. It'd be impossible to put down, except for the fact that it's so thick and, well, people need to sleep every now and again.<br />Reading this book, I was continually amazed at the amount of knowledge packed into Alan Fletcher's brain.
B00003CXTG|1.0|two guys fall in love with the same girl, and it strains their friendship. oh and just so you know the Japanese bomb...some ships. this movie was [awful] when it came out, and now after everythings happened, this movie just looks worse and even more pathetic. the only ups are the special effects and...special effects. this movie misses the point by such a margine its offensive.
B00005OCMR|5.0|An excellent special edition DVD. I don't even resent having bought the ordinary non-special DVD a year ago. The deleted scene is not much, but the documentaries and production materials are top-notch. This is not your standard rah-rah infomercial about the movie focusing on stars bellyaching about how hard they worked on the movie or, even worse, telling you the story of the movie which you already know. Here, the director and production team intelligently discuss the technical hurdles the film presented, what techniques were used (and invented) to achieve the effects, and even the political situation at Disney involved in getting the film produced. Some really interesting thought and work went into creating this film, and the DVD doesn't skimp.
0671027344|5.0|This book easily finds a place on the list of top ten best books in the latter half of the 20th century. It is astonishing that The Perks of Being a Wall Flower is Chbosky's first novel.  My copy has passed through the hands of family members, friends, friends of friends etc. The bittersweet and quiet awakening of Charlie reminds readers to sometimes sit back and enjoy rain, music, life as it happens as opposed to retrospectively. The Perks of Being a Wallflower changed my expectations of novels and changed the way that I read and write...  Missing this read is foolish. Read it and revel in the possibility of of youth.
B00005QK3W|1.0|After picking up on Paul again with \\"Flaming Pie\\", then \\"Run, Devil, Run\\" and then hearing good press about \\"Driving Rain\\", I was massively dissappointed when I struggled to listen to it the first time. What happened. I couldn't understand all the glowing reviews when confronted with hearing it. I mean, I even like \\"Wildlife\\". I forced myself to listen a couple times, a very unpleasant task. Is he trying to hard, or not at all? The songs are simplistic, the lyrics juvenile, and they go on forever and there are too many songs and the production and band are bad and..... I lent it to someone to listen to and I'm not in a hurry to get it back. Hopefully he has gotten it out of his system and the next one will be better, it couldn't be any worse.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I never got to see this movie in the theater, but finally saw it late last year on rental.  I fell in love with the characters and thought that it had an endearing storyline.  Though the actual Pearl Harbor \\"reinactment\\" comes later in the movie, I found this flick full of suspense and surprises... not to mention, a total babe fest!  Yum!
B00005QHSN|4.0|In case you've read somewhere that TTD is a very arrogant man, well, this isn't about having beers with him but listening to his music. And what great music he makes!<BR>This latest album is a big surprise after many years of silence. A perfect string of 18 tunes, at least half of which are nothing less than awesome. This is timeless soul music with perfect hooks, pop sensibilities and inspired melodies; some of the tracks could actually be in the soundtrack of &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; - yes, they are *that* good.<BR>Last but not least, his voice sounds better than ever here.<BR>A wonderful record to start your mornings with.
6300214435|5.0|This 1984 sequel to the 1981 classic &quot;Raiders Of The Lost Ark&quot;, is a real important film to me. I saw it 11 times in the theaters and I was mesmerized. I hadn't seen anything like it before. It's one of those films that brings back great memories from your youth. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford all return for this chapter. It takes place 10 years later, and Indy is joined by a nightclub singer, Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw), and a young sidekick named Short Round(Ke Huy - Quan from &quot;The Goonies&quot;), on a mission to find and rescue young children who have been kidnapped from a small village by some sort of cult. Indy and his gang infiltrate this incredible palace, only to discover the horror that lurks below the place. This film definitley has the Saturday morning serial cliffhanger thing going here. More so than the first and third installments. This movie is a little darker and more violent than &quot;Raiders&quot;. Some fans didn't think that was such a good thing. Their loss. This movie is a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. It's a movie that never stops being entertaining. There are a number of classic scenes in here, like - The mine cart chase, the airplane scene, the water out the side of the mountain, the rope bridge. You know it's a good movie when you can think of a number of good scenes like that. Once again, Spielberg has a nice eye for details. Ford is the most charismatic hero of the century. No one comes close. Capshaw and Quan are on hand mostly for comedic support. Just lay back, get some popcorn, and get ready to have your spines tingled when Indy's theme song starts....

B000000XBC|5.0|This follow up to Chronicle 1 is just as essential and rich as the first volume. This one consists mostly of album songs that were never released as singles. Some of them were. That's something that makes this CD even more fun to listen too than the classic hit filled first volume. Everyone knows those songs, but a lot of these songs aren't well known to the casual observer. You get cover versions of &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; and an unbelieveable pitch perfect cover of Ricky Nelson's great hit &quot;Hello Mary lou&quot;. Fogerty was definitley channeling Ricky on that one!. It's a mystery as to why a CCR classic such as &quot;Born On The Bayou&quot; is on this volume instead of the first one. Other gems here are &quot;Don't Look Now(It Ain't You Or Me)&quot;, the up tempo funk of &quot;Born To Move&quot;, and the rocker &quot;Pagan Baby&quot;. The band was known for doing fairly short to the point rock songs with no glitz or glamor. They are pretty much the quintessential rock band. There are many songs on here that you knew and heard of, but didn't realize that it was them who did it. Songs like &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; and &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;. This collection also gives you the fun novelty rocker &quot;It Came Out Of The Sky&quot;. It also has the undoubtedly perfect ballad, &quot;(Wish I Could) Hideaway&quot;. If you have Volume one, then you need this one. It's an essential piece of music that would be in any rock and roll fan's collection.

But if you want to be able to distinquish<BR>between the diffrent songs than this isn't for you. I was very dissapointed.

630157401X|4.0|Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were back along with Harrison Ford for this 3rd and final entry in this incredibly successful and beloved trilogy of films. The film was released in the summer of 1989, which was a tough summer. Batman, Ghostbusters 2, Lethal Weapon 2, Licence To Kill, etc. Indy held his own for the last time. The film is set in 1938, Indy is battling nazis who want to find the holy grail. This time around, we are joined by two characters who were seen in \\"Raiders\\", but not in \\"Temple Of Doom\\". Those characters being Marcus Brody(played by Denholm Elliot), and Sallah(played by John Rhys-Davies). But, the most interesting character is Indiana's dad, who is played by the perfect and hilarious Sean Connery. Who better?. The dialogue between Indy and his dad are comic gems. Allison Doody(nice name)is along for the ride as the token babe. This film definitley got back more to the adventure of \\"Raiders\\". \\"Temple\\" was a little dark and violent, and this film has steered away from that. The action is expertly filmed, and Spielberg, as always, has a keen eye of direction and scenery. Once you hear the opening notes of Indy's trademark song, you instantly get shivers up your spine. River Phoenix appears in the opener as Indy as a teen. As for the rumored Indy 4, I kinda hope it happens and I kinda don't. It would be great to see another Indy film, but will it be the same without thinking that Harrison will be in his 60's by then?. I guess we'll see. Anyways, this is a wonderful entry in the series. Check it out.
0393307050|5.0|When Lieutenant Jack Aubrey Royal Navy meets Stephen Maturin, physician of Spain and Ireland, in the elegant music room of the Governor's house in Port Mahon at the dawn of the Nineteenth Century and in the middle of the Napoleonic wars, a friendship is begun which is one of the most remarkable in modern literature.<br />For twenty books we follow the adventures of this pair, around the world, in love and war, sun and storm, battle and peace, at sea and on land. The reader who stays with them - and it is not uncommon to read all twenty books, one after the other - is in for a feast, a remarkable journey through this world of sea-captains and their ladies, spies and spymasters, politicians, convicts, bureaucrats and soldiers. Grand ladies and scoundrels, thiefs, bailiffs and bums.<br />But I stray. This is the first volume, and like all the others it stands alone as a story. It is the story of Lucky Jack Aubrey and his cruises in the sloop HMS Sophie up and down the Mediterranean, but chiefly off the coasts of France and Spain. There is victory and promotion, death and failure, glory and satisfaction before we get to the end.<br />The atmosphere is unerringly authentic. Every word is researched, every setting, every ship, every part of a ship. We are taken aloft in a square-rigger, we man the guns in a sea-battle, and we line the rails as she comes home to port. All in exquisite detail.<br />But this is more than Hornblower or his later imitators. This is a step up. These battles and characters, settings and seamen are far, far more than the \\"fighting sail\\" equivalent of today's technothriller. No cardboard characters here! Every one is finely drawn, acting according to their own desires and ambitions, with their own habits and mannerisms. Here is Mowett, declaiming snatches of poetry, remarkably turgid poetry that was published by the yard in those days. (Thankfully we never hear more than a verse or two). Here is Killick, bringing in the Captain's salt horse, Midshipman Babbington interested in the ladies but amazingly coy about it. Barret Bonden, Tom Pullings - a host of characters!<br />The humour, the gentle good humour, sets this book aside from all the others with a sailing ship on the cover. There are wonderful jokes, there is restrained word play, there are hidden treasures of subtlety, for Patrick O'Brian was a deep old file, and every now and then he sets the reader up for a prank, all the more pleasurable for being found out and appreciated at its proper moment.<br />One remarkable aspect is the popularity of this series amongst the fairer sex. This is not a catalogue of sea-battles and nineteenth century naval technology, but a tale of manners and relationships that would do Jane Austen proud.<br />We feel for the characters, suffering and smiling with them as the narrative unfolds. And we can feel the relationships folding in turn - Jack and Stephen might begin the story as mere acquaintances, but they end as firm friends, one of the best and most pleasant friendships in literature.<br />For, rest assured, this is literature. A most amazingly pleasant novel-series that is both fun to read and yet contains enough deep insights and discussions of fundamental themes for any university course.<br />I must confess I am biased. I read Hornblower as a schoolboy and began reading his imitators - Bolitho, Ramage and the rest. I'd buy each book as they were published but as time went by I perservered with only one author, and the annual wait for the next Patrick O'Brian seemed to stretch out to double or triple the time. I have now read them all, for Patrick O'Brian died as the Twentieth Century ended, but I still read and re-read them for the sheer pleasure of the reading. And I am a busy man, with piles of wonderful books stacked high on my bedside table, but there is nothing in fiction quite so pleasant as to return to the dear old barky, hear the strains of Locatelli from the great stern-cabin, spy Killick waiting by the door with coffee and toasted cheese, and a cheery voice from the Gunroom cry \\"Rouse out another bottle there - can't you see we've got a guest?\\"<br />O happy meeting, and happy voyage in this first of a great novel series. Dear reader, do yourself a favour and plunge into this wonderful world. ...
B00003CXXP|4.0|I have noticed one major thing about any movie Stanley Kubrick was behind - People either love it or hate it.  Yes, this was directed by Spielberg but I thought he stuck very closely to Kubrick's style and original concept.  At least that's what I felt when I saw the movie.<BR>Yes, it is long and does drag at times, hence the four star rating but having seen quite a few Kubrick films and having been fore warned about it's length, I new what I was expecting.<BR>In my opinion, this movie was primarily made for two reasons:<br />1 - A feast for the eyes.  The special effects were outstanding.  Add Spielberg's direction and Kubrick's concept and you have an idea of how visually delightful this film is.<br />2 - Meaning which must be thought about.  Unlike most films, this has underline messages which isn't thrown in your face or handed to you on a silver platter.  This movie was made to make you think and, if you're willing to do so, will.<br />Overall, no, the movie wasn't made for everyone.  But for those of us who are willing to search beyond what is fed to you for meaning, this movie is far from boring.
0764005685|5.0|Back in 1987 I went to my local movie theater to see CREEPERS,the then latest from italian horror filmmaker master Dario Argento.I enjoyed the film,muddled it was plot-wise.I bought the soundtrack lp and that's about it.Flash forward to 2002,I'm looking through the videos at amazon,and,HEY!The uncut and restored CREEPERS back in it's european form-PHENOMENA!I don't have a dvd player yet,so I got the vhs version.A great print presented in Widescreen,2 music videos,a behind the scenes feature on the spfx,and Dario interviewed by Joe Franklin.Anchor Bay rocks!
0440234743|5.0|Sometimes I really enjoy John Grisham.  Other times I'm not as receptive.  But this time I was hooked right from the first page.  Grisham develops his characters with great authenticity as well as the plot.
0780629450|5.0|Branaugh's Hamlet has spoiled me to all other productions of Shakespeare's great tragedy. Set in a wonderful Edwardian backdrop, I dare you to not be blown away by the epic sweep of Branaugh's vision.<br />Excellent performances are turned in all over this place in this movie. Branaugh is very good as Hamlet. Though not my vision of Claudius, Derek Jacobi is outstanding. Richard Briers is an unforgettable Polonius. Judi Dench and Charlton Heston are great in their very limited roles.<br />Perhaps the highlight of the entire cast is Nicholas Farrell's Horatio. The is such a natural. His expression of emotion without words is great contrast to Hamlet's verbally emotional expression.<br />Even Kate Winslet, who I don't usually care for, turns out to be a very good Ophelia (though the guy who plays her brother looks a little too Edgar Allan Poe-ish for my tastes).<br />From the opening picture of the statue to its shattering at the end...this movie is sheer genius. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0684874350|5.0|This is probably the most pivotal book I have read in my entire life.  And I have read a lot of books.  Frank writes so well that at parts in the memoir I almost felt that I was experiencing what he was.  If you ever read a memoir, there is none better and more thought-provoking than this one.  Get it! Read it! And let it change your life!
B00005Q66T|5.0|So we've already seen her collection of greatest hits from the '80s, THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. Now, we are onto her collection of greatest hits from the '90s. GHV2 is totally an awesome CD! I was slightly disappointed when I bought this CD, because one of my favorite Madonna songs is not on here--her remake of &quot;American Pie&quot;. Oh well. Guess I'm gonna have to buy THE NEXT BEST THING soundtrack now, because that's the only CD that features &quot;American Pie&quot; (or as far as I'm concerned at least). This greatest hits album features her hit singles from her albums BEDTIME STORIES, RAY OF LIGHT, and MUSIC. It also features the song &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;, which can be found on the AUSTIN POWERS 2: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME soundtrack, and the song, &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot;, which can be found on the soundtrack to Madonna's film, EVITA.<br />&quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot;, &quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, and &quot;Take A Bow&quot; are all from her BEDTIME STORIES album. &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot;, &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Frozen&quot; are all from her RAY OF LIGHT album. &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; are all from her MUSIC album. My favorite tunes off this disc are &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot;, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;The Power Of Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;, and &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot;. Honestly, I love them all. But those happen to be my personal favorite if I had to choose. <br />I love Madonna's music and I think she is truly inspiring. She definitely is the Queen of Pop! If you love Madonna's singles, then GHV2 is a must and definitely an essential!
B00003CXXP|5.0|I was personally, seriously disturbed by this picture. There is something exceptionally unnerving about what's happening in the first era that the movie opens in. It is a transitional world where humans are slowly and voluntarily replacing themselves with robots, to serve emotional needs or deficiencies. This is a path which the film eventually shows leads to extinction. This is made all the more disturbing, as it convincingly touches on problems extant in universal human attitudes toward our creations. <br />I remember being extremely troubled by my feelings for the David & Joe robots at the \\"Flesh Fair\\" where the spectators stone the man who warns the audience what is happening. We axiomatically perceive this character as a cruel villain, but he is the true messenger of the fact that they are replacing themselves and surrendering their future. He warns them they will choose the artificial children over having their own and as if to prove his postulation, they choose the robots over him. That was quite a spectacle indeed. <br />There are so many deft characterizations in this film. For example, the future robots idealization or romanticization of Mankind and his rusting relics and ideas following his extinction. We do the same thing with all dead civilizations and cultures, after we have wiped them out. When they cease to be a threat, they become sublime.<br />Highly recommended.
0395177111|5.0|I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius.  The Hobbit relates the reader to the character.  The story is also adventurous and exciting.  I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time.  A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards.  The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time.  After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more.  It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding.
B00003XB8K|4.0|To all those fellow Enigma fans, this is a great album. They still preserve all those qualities that we love, all the beautiful rhythms and melodic sounds. Although this album was beautiful, I felt that I should expect a little more. Maybe a few more 'complete' songs, perhaps a few more rememberable songs.... I recommend this cd for all Enigma fans and all ambiance lovers, but I would first listen to &quot;Love Sensuality Devotion&quot; and if you're torn as to which cd to get first, I suggest the latter. Don't get me wrong, &quot;Screen&quot; is very well put together and is very beautiful, but &quot;Love Sensuality Devotion&quot; is much more rememberable.
0679405372|3.0|First of all, this was my first experience in reading a stream of consciousness book. When I first began reading it, I thought I would enjoy it more than I did.  Since I only read it in my spare time, which would sometimes only be fifteen minutes, I did not pay as much attention to the small details as I should have.  It became difficult for me to follow each character because my own mind wondered off as the pages turned. Generally, I enjoy books that are suspenseful or have a fast-paced storyline, so this was simply not the style of book for me.  Do not read this book if you are looking for an exciting plot or simply do not have the time to put into reading this short novel. <BR>  <BR>There were many reasons why I did not enjoy reading this classic.  First of all, I disliked the author's complex, third person omniscient shifting of perspectives through the various characters in the tale.  The book focuses more on the summer home in the Hebrides than on the actual characters themselves.  Only the character's inner thoughts are written about and there are very few physical descriptions of them.  The story is more about the inner workings and complexities of the small group of people than the lighthouse (or going there).  Narrative voice is shared between characters as narration becomes thought and smoothly passes from character to character, anticipating the stream of consciousness style. The themes are also very abstract and its plot structure becomes undefined at times.<BR> <BR>To the Lighthouse is a quiet and meditative novel that deals with post World War I issues.  Often, I felt as if Woolf could not hold a single thought or development long enough to<BR>make me care about anything.  Virginia Woolf did give glances to a few good story possibilities, but then she would move on to something else; thus, losing my interest and never truly<BR>developing any character or situation.  As soon as something intriguing was about to occur, the book would jump back to eventsthat happened in the past chapters.  <BR> <BR>I have read books that I enjoyed less than To the Lighthouse, so I do not consider it to be a horrible piece of literature.  If you like to read stories that jump and skip from place to place, then maybe this novel is for you.  I felt this novel could have adequately been told as a short story with its only lost being its monotone and dull nature.  I had to struggle to complete this book, so maybe the meaning was just lost on me.  I kept reading to see if there was some literary genius buried within, but unfortunately I never found it.
B00004Z459|5.0|\\"Hybrid Theory\\", in my opinion, is one awesome album. Ever have one of those days where you just want to hide and forget everything? Play this cd and you will. The music is perfect for just letting everything go and involving yourself in relating to the lyrics. The lyrics are beautiful and true. \\"In the End\\" is life to a tee. \\"Slipping Away\\" is a shot out for everyone that feels a relationship coming to end, but who still stands there and lets the door slam in their face. It's a great cd to have, and to play everyday. I swear, I bought the cd last august and it hasn't left my car stereo for longer than a day or two. It's the ultimate driving music! Buy it and love it!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|What a ridiculous string of cliches and bad dialogue this screenplay was made up of.The invasion sequence was amazing,but to make audiences sit through two hours of literally the worst love story in movie history is in itself a crime against humanity.If you must go see this movie,buy your DVD and just go to the attack scene.
B00000JCOV|2.0|Hey, look, it doesn't matter if you like this or not, but either way, please don't call this metal.  I'm not hearing anything here (other than screaming, which isn't even really a huge part of true metal) that sounds like metal at all.  If anything, I'd refer to it as heavy techno, or heavy rap.<br />First things first.  This could have been a great album.  They intended to infuse different musical styles, and make an album that is genre-bending and diverse, but instead they failed miserably and made an album that is nothing but noise.  Now, it's not to say there isn't talent here.  Corey Taylor is a very talented vocalist, and has a lot of range in his voice, Joey Jordison is a pretty good drummer (but nowhere near the best, Mike Portnoy and Dave Lombardo would slaughter him), and Mick Thomson is reputedly a good guitarist (at least, he seems to think so, and plus I heard he used to be a guitar teacher), but there's just not a lot of musicality here.  You'd be hard-pressed to be able to tell that the guitarists can play at all, since their playing is buried under a wall of distorted noise.  Even Wes Borland can almost convince people he's good (well, I'm not one of those people).  Besides some spurts of decent drumming, everything on here just coalesces into pure noise...  But, as I said, Corey is a great vocalist, and though a lot of his lyrics are almost as inane as Limp Bizkit, he's always enjoyable to listen to.  It's just that it's hard to deal with the train wreck backing it up.<br />But hey, it's not to say that there isn't hope for this band.  I think \\"Iowa\\" was a progression to a much better sound.  There is a lot more metal in it (although I, and I'm sure a lot of other people resent it being referred to as \\"death metal\\"), and the weird effects have been cut to a minimum.  I wouldn't call it good, but it's a sizable step up from this...
B00003CXTG|5.0|I loved it.It was so beautiful.It was the best movie I ever saw.I have never seen such a good movie.I can't believe Josh died.It had a great cast.All the guys were hot.I just couldn't believe it was all true.Josh,Ben,Cuba,and Alec all looked good in uniform.
B00003CWTH|4.0|What else can you say? Even though filmmaking can be a tedious process (I got stressed just trying to make a 30 minute movie to try to get into NYU Film School), it seems there was never a dull moment during the making of this. All performances are top notch, the best of all being that of former pretty boy turned damn fine actor Tom Cruise. Here's a guy who everyone pegged as just anotehr pretty face to guarantee big box office turnover who has taken everyone, including me, by surprise. Ever since I saw him in RAIN MAN, I knew this guy was going to be an actually decent actor. Then came JERRY MAGUIRE, and my suspicions were confirmed. Cruise doesn't disappoint here as womanizing Frank Mackey, busy running a seminar called &quot;seduce and destroy&quot; to teach other men his secrets of seduction. Of course there is much more to the film than this, but I'm just focusing on Tommy boy here cos he absolutely blew me away in this role. His scene by the bed with his dad is absolutely gut-wrenching. This is one you don't wanna miss. FEaturing many wonderful songs by former Til Tuesday girl Aimee Mann, the soundtrack is also money well spent.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Please stop Jerry Bruckheimer,haven't you done enough damage.
B000002JS6|5.0|Come on, AC/DC may have juvenile lyrics, but that's the point! People criticize them as mindless \\"anthem\\" songs but so what? That's what AC/DC is good at, and they never had a finer collection of raise-your-fist-in-the-air songs than the ones on this CD. I mean, I'm a big fan of Smashing Pumpkins-style let's-get-serious-and-use-music-to-exorcise-our-personal-demons material, but every now and then you gotta put AC/DC in the stereo to remind yourself, \\"oh yeah...rock and roll can be FUN!!!!!!\\" The riffs are great, the solos inspirational, the rhythm section solid as a rock, and the vocals are stronger than ever. No offense to gone-before-his-time frontman Bon Scott, but I think Brion Johnson is the better singer. BACK IN BLACK is one reason why.

0792838084|5.0|How does one describe Blue Velvet? Disturbing, entertaining, romantic (yes, I did say romantic), mysterious, brilliant. Those words all describe Blue Velvet. This is a masterpiece of cinema. With all of David Lynch's brilliance, he has or may never touch a film this great again. <BR>Dennis Hopper. Why isn't this man in a category of the legends? Why isn't he revered as much as Pacino, DeNiro or Nicholson? Dennis Hopper can take the most wacked-out roles and transform them into legendary villains (Speed, Apocalypse Now).<BR>Kyle MacLachlan does an incredible job with his protagonistic role as does Laura Dern, playing the innocent virgin. Isabella Rossellini is also incredible as the victim, and there is always the cast of crazy characters David Lynch is famous for (Dean Stockwell, Jack Nance, to name a few). But the show is stolen by the script and cinematography. The scene of Dean Stockwell's lip sync is one of the greatest scenes in the history. It's why we have film. Plus, extra mention should me made about the score. <BR>Blue Velvet is not for the kids. It has graphic language, nudity and some violent moments not for the squeamish. But if you're in the mood to be disturbed, Blue Velvet is the movie for you.

B00005O3VC|5.0|I will refrain from actually reviewing this film, because if you aren't familiar with it... where have you been? Here are my thoughts on the DVD release...<br />The documentaries aren't done in the style you might expect, but instead feature things like cast members walking about meadows, pointing, and reminiscing about &quot;that happened there&quot; and &quot;Graham couldn't remember this here&quot; and such. Very enlightening, but a tad long. For a better Python doc, check out &quot;Life of Python&quot; on DVD.<br />Other features include a very funny animated LEGO short, sing-alongs, and my personal favorite: The subtitles and audio tracks. There is a special section of the film you can watch dubbed in Japanese then re-translated into English for subtitles. There are subtitles from Henry IV Pt II for people who don't enjoy the film. There is a shouting track for the hearing impaired. Then, there are commentary tracks where you can hear some Pythons passive-aggressively &quot;discussing&quot; differences during the filming. A great film, a great DVD.
0823003035|5.0|This is an exquisite book. The drawings are utterly fabulous, but the text and &quot;teaching illustrations&quot; are also outstanding. The author has such a friendly and accessable way of writing, his text is a joy to read. Every bit of it has value - no fluff here. I even learned a lot from his drawing material recommendations! (I have been pretty settled on what drawing papers I use, but after reading his chapter on it, I went out and got new drawing pads!)<br />It's an absolute treasure. The artwork is brilliant, and gorgeous. A must-have for any library.
B00005T30L|4.0|A well-done, solidly performed adaptation of a fine graphic novel, Ghost World is resonant with anyone who felt themselves either outgrow, outpace, or lose touch with their friends and family. I hate to say &quot;coming of age story&quot;, but there ya go.<br />Thora Birch gives a strong performance as a girl who isn't quite sure who she is but knows she isn't anything she sees around her. Steve Buscemi gives his personal best as a record seller whose social awkwardness has become a treasured possession. Fun cameos include: Teri Garr (uncredited) and David Cross as...well, I'll leave that to you.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Way back when I heard that Miss Shakira was going to be recording her first album in English I was so thrilled!  And I only heard her Grammy speech.  Girl is hot!  And when \\"Laundry Service\\" was finally released I wasn't a bit surprised at Miss S's detonating debut.  \\"Whenever Wherever\\" is by far the single of 2001, that songs just kicks my butt from start to finish.  Great choice to introduce this baby to the ears of english speaking America.  \\"Objection(Tango)\\" is my fav song the ablum, the middle rap part is killer-pure genius.  \\"Fool\\" is also my personal anthem of the day(so fab).  I like her lyrics, they aren't frilly, they mean what they say and say what they mean.  \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" was written by the everlasting Gloria Estefan so you know that one is good, and crank up Shakira's lastest single \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" for a hyper latin power rock pop power ballad.  If you don't get this album, then well...I just feel sorry for you.  It is life changing.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The \\"Usual Suspects\\" is a movie that has been since it's release very underrated.  This film will keep you on your seat from beginning to end and unlike most movies nowadays does not drop off with a predictable ending.  Kevin Spacey won a best Supporting Actor Oscar for his preformance and I can honestly say it is one of the finest I have ever seen.  A great movie, one that if you have not seen, I highly suggest it.
B00005Y1Y3|4.0|The material for Live In America was recorded mostly in 1970. Although it's not The Doors at their peak, it's still worth listening to. More importantly, the songs are originals-- unlike the spliced together tracks from Absolutely Live and In Concert. Buy it today.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russell Crowe shines as Maximus in \\"Gladiator\\".  The movie starts off intense with a great battle and barely stops all the way to the end.  The only flaw I found with the film is around the 2 hour mark the movie seems to start dragging its feet a little bit.  Also, if you are not a fan of gore, this may not be the movie for you.  The DVD effects are as loaded as any DVD I have ever seen.  An excellent way to start your DVD collection with a fine historical action movie.
0385505833|1.0|(zero-star review)<br />So Luther and Nora Krank decide to skip Christmas one year.  Why not?  Their daughter's grown up and far away; why NOT just skip the nuisance and take a cruise?<br />Thus begins Grisham's attempt at a seasonal fable of pseudo-Dickensian proportions... and this is pretty much where it fizzles, too.  You see, everything goes wrong for the Kranks (maybe you could have guessed it would from their names!), with the whole thing ending in a debacle I won't reveal in case you do decide to waste your time reading this thing.<br />This annoying little book amounts to little more than a tract for peace, joy and goodwill among men -- as expressed in the only way Grisham apparently sees fit:  with a tree and lights and an electric Frostie propped up on your roof.<br />Grisham's smeared-thick moralism might not be out of place in a seasonal sermon, but in a book targeted for popular consumption... well, like every heavy, super-sticky, rich meal I've ever eaten, it just didn't seem to sit right.<br />I could handle A Painted House; honest, I could.  I'd love to support Grisham's attempts to burst out of the apparently-oppressive mold his best-selling legal thrillers have imprisoned him in.  But I can't vouch for Skipping Christmas for the plain & simple reason that it stinks.<br />Believe it or not, Christmas isn't all about big parties, bright trees, presents and carols.  It's not even all about family and love.  For Christians, it's about the birth of a messiah who brought God's message of hope to a pagan world.<br />And for us non-Christians...?  Well, Christmas is a time when we hope our Christian neighbours will live up to that message and treat us with the kind of tolerance that doesn't attempt to force everybody on the block into some image of cookie-cutter perfection.<br />I consider this book only one step up from hate literature, with non-Christmas people depicted as outcasts and humbugs, if not downright evil for undermining the spirit of the season.  There are better, warmer Christmas stories, every one of them more true to the holiday's real message than this icky confection.season.

6305546789|5.0|I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said.  I think I'll try to go against the grain and think of reasons not to get this movie.<br />....<br />....<br />....<br />....uh.  Bellbottoms.  If George Lucas can add in Jabba the Hutt twenty years later, maybe John Carpenter can go back and paint in some Dungarees or leather pants.  Mmmmm.  Jamie Lee Curtis in leather pants.  ...  That reminds me of another flaw -- there's just no way in Hades that that guy could land P J Soles.<br />Seriously, masterpiece doesn't even begin to describe John Carpenter's Halloween.  The framing, the MUSIC~, the performances, everything just...clicks, ya know.  No other Carpenter work comes close to rivaling the suspense in Halloween.  The Fog and The Thing are good, not great.  I guess you just have to be lucky sometimes.<br />I used to have it in the full frame version.  That was a crime.  You couldn't even see the garage murder.  It looked like she just had a heart attack and fell into the steering column.  Ditto for the scene when P J Soles and that guy are making out on the couch.  The camera pulls back to reveal Michael Myers standing there watching them.  For years I had no idea what the scary music was for.  No worries now, though.  2.35:1 Babee!<br />The music -- where do I start?  It's so...simple.  Just like the film.  Good vs. [Bad].  They should start out piano students with this instead of scales.<br />TV VERSION~ I love the scene where Dr. Loomis visits a young Michael Myers.  No Druids.  No Man with the Thorn.  Just good psychotic fun.<br />The DVD is great, but with a glaring exception.  I'll get to that.  The trailers are awesome and trailer-cutters of today could take a lesson.  No big plot points revealed, no \\"it's all in the trailer\\" scenes.  Just looking at a house.  The ominous voice of a narrator.  I think he did every horror movie trailer from 74-84.  The documentaries are also good.  It would have been interesting to see Michael Myers with a clown mask.  Clowns.  Shudder.  The one glaring omission is the lack of director commentary.  I may be wrong, but I heard that the Laserdisc (what's that?) version had a commentary track from Carpenter.  Oh well, he reveals a lot on the documentaries anyway.<br />Go down the street... and get this DVD!!!n mask.  Clowns.  Shudder.  The one glaring omission is the lack of director commentary.

B00003CX7L|5.0|Rarely is a sequel better than its predecessor, but the Disney/Pixar combo has struck gold again.<br />We once again visit the world of toys to meet with Woody, Buzz and the gang.  Harmony has been established as Woody and Buzz can now co-exist with one another, until Woody is kidnapped trying to save another toy.<br />This is a fun movie, even for adults.  I do not even have children, but my wife and I were both able to enjoy this movie.<br />The voice work and artistry were well-done, topping Pixar's previous works, Toy Story and A Bug's Life.  The work done by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were well done, as always, but the addition of Wayne Knight, Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer to the cast, were good choices and they played the parts well.<br />This is a great movie for the kids, but there is enough in there for the adults to make this a guilty pleasure for the adults.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This film is single handedly one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking.The film starts out at the end of the film and works its way backwards.

B000002C1W|3.0|I really wanted to like this album, and I do, but not the way I like most Pink Floyd albums.  This album was put together for a couple reasons:<br />1. As a way for the rest of the band to tell Roger Waters that they can work without him.<br />2. David Gilmore's solo career was going nowhere.<br />3. The record execs wanted a new Pink Floyd album.<br />From all accounts, that I have read, the execs did not like what the band originally put together, so they brought in writers to help make the album more &quot;Floydian.&quot;  That was probably a mistake as what was originally put together would probably have been better.<br />To those people who had this album as their first exposure to Pink Floyd, you can expect much better things with their next album or with their earlier work.  Try Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here.<br />All this being said, it is not a bad album and no one should be embarrassed to own it or have it as part of his or her collection.  Some of the songs are pretty good and enjoyable.  My recommendation would be to buy this album used or get it on sale, don't buy it at full price.
B001AQT0RC|3.0|This movie was fine until the ending.  ** SPOILERS AHEAD ** Why would Aliens go to all the trouble to send us plans to a huge space transportation machine just so they could say \\"hello\\" and do nothing?  That's just an insane plot failure if you ask me.  When Foster does arrive at the Alien planet, they make everything look like Florida and the Alien she meets looks like her dad?  She goes through all that fuss, traveling across the stars just so she could see things that she can see anytime on Earth.  She gets about a 10 minute conversation with the Alien, who tells her basically nothing, then promptly sends her back.  That is just ridiculous and disappointing.  I get that the underlying theme was about \\"faith\\", but they could have done more with that ending.  At the very end of the film, Foster is speaking with some school kids and one asks her if there are life forms out there in space.  What does she say?  She tells him \\"Good question...\\"  So, what are we supposed to take from that answer?  Why didn't she just say \\"yes\\"?  Did she doubt what she saw and heard?  Just a weak weak end of events that just left me unhappy with the whole thing.  Maybe I'm just too pragmatic.
B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd without Roger Waters; some will call it sacrilege; others will say it is a good thing.  For good or bad, this album marked the true rebirth of Pink Floyd.<br />Unlike Momentary Lapse of Reason, this album was a true collaborative effort, which it could be argued, has not been so since Wish You Were Here.<br />Once again, the band visited the theme of Communication.  This can be seen in the album cover and in songs like &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot; and &quot;Keep Talking&quot;<br />The overall tone was classic Floyd and reminded me of Wish You Were Here with a touch Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Wall.  For the first time in a long time, Gilmore Wright and Mason all seemed to be enjoying themselves and having fun playing together and collaborating.<br />It is very possible that this may be the last joint effort of these three men, but if this album is any sign of what they can do together, when they want to be together, it is a sign of good things to come.
B00000DRA9|5.0|The music is one of the best aspects of the film adaptation of Michael Ende's The Neverending Story. Throw it on and you're instantly catapulted back to the film's lush fantasy visuals -- that first glimpse of the Ivory Tower... facing the Oracles... riding on the Luck Dragon... fleeing Gmork and the Nothing... If you love the movie, the soundtrack is an absolute must-have, especially now that it's available on CD (I wore out my cherished cassette tape in the 80s).
B00001OH7U|5.0|I have been a Bowie fan since I was falling asleep to my favorite  rock station while in highschool.  Just as  started to drift off \\"Young Americans\\" came on.  I woke right up and listened in awe.  Bowie's music is like that, it rivets you, and it's always unique, album to album, CD to CD, and especially \\"Station To Station.\\"<br /><br />Since this was part of Bowies debauched cocaine addled  Germany experience, I first heard the incredible title cut in the depressed non-fictional drug saga \\"Christiane F.\\"  That story, if you are unfamiliar, tells of the heroin addiction of a teenage German girl on Kunfurstendamn, and during her desperation, \\"Station To Station\\" comes on.  The way Bowie is singing \\"It's Too Late...\\" and the incredible jamming rock track pumping was just the perfect song for the scene.  I LOVE great use of music in film, like Scorcese has mastered and re-mastered.  After watching the movie, I bought the LP, and then replaced with the CD.<br /><br />The biggest hit here is probably \\"Golden Years\\", which is a classic, but I think \\"TVC15\\"is brilliant and funky with that trilling piano work.  Like I said, it's ALL excellent Bowie.  I still think the title track is THE ultimate cut, however, the lead in is too long and drawn out.  I like when the song transitions at the 5 minute mark, THEN it becomes Bowies finest jam EVER.  The guitars, piano, bass, drums...WOW!<br /><br />If you are a David Bowie enthusiast, here is one entry in his discography that you should not miss.
B00005QZWI|3.0|The actual recording of Howard Shore's score is, of course, excellent -- you are immediately transported back to what you heard (and what  you saw, if you buy soundtracks for the same reasons I do) in the theatre. However, there lies my complaint -- I was not completely satisfied with this score. Though much of it was excellently visual and instantly powerful (all to Shore's credit), I thought things relied too heavily on both Enya's doleful musical flutterings and standard Irish folk turnings -- not enough of an original sound. Hobbiton is not Ireland, and Enya doesn't dwell among the Elves. Sheesh. The music could have been excellent -- more of tracks like the magnificent 'A Journey In The Dark' -- but instead it loses potency when Enya is allowed to step in for the &quot;ethereal&quot; bits. Enya has one great album -- Watermark. Everything before was too synthesized, and everything since, including her work on this soundtrack, has been a retread of her simplistic New Age musical formula. I was disappointed that she was involved in creating the sound of LOTR -- the potential to do something original and truer to the spirit of Tolkien has been wasted.
0767819594|5.0|Aptly titled, this is a fascinating study of two spoiled rich kids, completely lacking in compunction. They have no regard or use for all that is decent and fair. It is the story of their relationship, one embroiled in a continuing one-upmanship, that ultimately becomes a losers game for all touched by it.<br /><br />There are four main characters, and they all have a special role. Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe), and Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar as a BRUNETTE) play two young collegiate step-siblings who try to out do eachother with the games they hurtfully engage their chosen victims in. Kathryn takes great pride in everyone thinking she's the sweet, innocent student body president. In reality she's a scheming, promiscuous coke snorter. Sebastian is a handsome, smug seducer, using his good looks to bed and heartlessly dump as many willing naive females as possible.  He keeps a journal of conquests, and his own private thoughts.<br /><br />Cecile (Selma Blair), is the PERFECT naive wanna-be cool girl come to campus. She becomes the perfect victim and pawn for Kathryn and Sebastian to use for their games while Annette (Reese Witherspoon), is a model of what the young american girl is SUPPOSED to be. Kathryn finds an article on her in a teen magazine entitled \\"Why I Want To Wait\\" about Annette keeping her viginity until legally wed. From there, Kathryn hatches a scheme. She makes a bet with Sebastian that he CAN'T seduce Annette. If he IS successful, he gets to bed Kathryn, putting \\"it\\" \\"anywhere.\\" If Kathryn wins, and Sebastian FAILS, she gets his prized '56 Jaguar Roadster. Kathryn's concurrent plan is to destroy Cecile's reputation because a guy dumped her for the Cecile. Let the cruelty begin!<br /><br />This is a film that takes you past the front gate to where the players of high society have and live by their own rules, no matter the cost. You can feel the privilige within. The dialogue throughout is clever witty reparte that is sharp and cutting as a knife. It is a real pleasure to listen to the banter, and see eyes roll with disgust. Christine Baranski is excellent as Cecile's uptight high society mom who is as stiff as the starch in her Chanel suit. Let's not forget, Kathryn's famous lesbian kiss scene in the park is hilarious too, as she pulls away, leaving Cecile puckered up, eyes closed and waiting for more!<br /><br />The most amazing thing in the movie is how you start out with different feelings about some of the characters, than you will have in the end. You come to see that love, when truly felt and experienced, can soften even the coldest heart.<br /><br />When viewing this film, there are times to laugh, be shocked, or shed a tear.  \\"Cruel Intentions\\" is a movie not to be missed.  The attractive cast, ritzy settings, and superb dialogue throughout, make this a mentally engaging and visual treat you will want to enjoy more than once.to listen to the banter, and see eyes roll with disgust.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I've heard many complaints about this album being too mellow, forced, or even unoriginal.  Frankly, I think Morning View is the next step for Incubus; I believe their next album well destroy all previous albums they have released.  Morning View has a number of good songs, and overall it is a very good album.<br />1.  Nice to Know You - a bass and drums driven verse followed by a heavy, catchy chorus...what does this remind you of?  How about much of Incubus's earlier work...and they have become sooo mellow. haha.  good song, not the best on the album.<br />2.  Circles - One of the hardest songs on the album, and the first to catch my attention.  So far this still sounds like Incubus.<br />3.  Wish you Were Here - This single did not impress me at all when I first heard it, but after seeing them playing it live, I have realized how good the song actually is.<br />4.  Just a Phase - One of the better songs on the CD, follows the rising action, climax idea...and does it well.  Changes in time signatures also add to the color of the song.<br />5.  11am - My favorite song on the album...it's straight foward and catchy, lyrics are intelligent and resemble \\"Deep Inside\\"<br />6.  Blood on the Ground - My least favorite song on the album, but everytime I listen to it, I envision how cool would be live.<br />7.  Mexico - reminds me of Drive at first, but upon a second listen, I realized it is a completely different kind of song.  It's catchy and good to listen to.<br />8.  Warning - Before the CD was released, I heard them play this song live, and was singing it on the way home...I didn't even have a clue what the lyrics were, It was THAT catchy.  A simple song whos complexity lies in the lyrics and intelligence of its arrangement.<br />9.  Echo - Sounds just like Stellar, I used to hate that about this song, but after a few listens, I have come to appreciate it; it is very catchy.<br />10.  Have You Ever - I am not fond of this song, the opening riff kind of annoys me.  After I see them live again, I think this song will become my least favorite.<br />11.  Are you In? - This song really really good.  It is a jam song, much like songs off of Enjoy Incubus, but with a new style.<br />12.  Under My Umbrella - Nothing reminds me more of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. than this song.  It is one of the funnest songs to listen to on the album.  I cannot wait to hear it live.<br />13.  Aqueous Transmission - I love the eastern inspired style of this song, it is very tranquil and an excellent choice for a last song.  It is well composed and shows how Incubus has expanded.<br />On a whole, I really like this album, and cannot wait to see them again.  I also cannot wait for their next album because I recognize the direction they are headed in, and I think it will be their best album.<br />Creed ...
B000002KLP|5.0|I fell in love with Prince on this album.  I was only 11 when it was released and wasn't allowed to listen to it at home (I snuck to my friend Pablo's house) but it's sound and influence are still as far reaching and enjoyable as they were almost 22 years ago. The punkish attack of these songs, the brisk pace and Prince's sexy falsetto on top of it all add up to absolutely joyful listening. This was considered shocking and taboo at the start of the 80's and Prince himself would get even more explicit over the next few years, but for sheer melodic splendor and some of the catchiest songs of his career, this still hard to match. A true modern classic.
B00005UEAR|3.0|I can 't make long pithy statements about the musicality or meaning of it all.  I was just disappointed.  It would be entirely possible for these guys to put 8 9-minute songs on a CD and melt your ears.  I want them to do that.  I think people would come running.  I will buy their CD's if for only two simple reasons:  the changes and number of notes keep you hopping.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|The ending is quite possibly the greatest example of movie producing I've ever seen, and the two hours after it don't leave me with any complaints either.<br />This movie is incredibly intelligent, and I presume it will go underappreciated - much like what I tried to achieve with my introductory sentence.  The acting, cinematography, and above all else, writing in this movie is unparalleled.<br />If you have difficulty following plots, I hate to say this, but you should probably avoid this one - no offense, but I have friends like you.  However, if your intrigue being grabbed forcefully and used to pull you towards the screen until your butt is about to fall off the chair is what you think movie watching should be all about, then you NEED to see this one ... because that's exactly what it does.
B00004XOWM|1.0|...One thing that kind of got under my skin was when the Europen Geramies gave Fred Durst the Gramey for album of the year as if he had good writing abilities or some thing even close to that. Some of the very worst songs I have ever heard like Hot Dog, My Generation, both of the Rolling's' ect. are on here and to me thats reson enough to hate this album.(It all[stinks) In my mind Bizket has not released any thing any good at all scence \\"Three Doller Bill Y'all\\" in 1997. <BR>From what I've heard the latest Bizket CD \\"New Old and Remixed\\" is the groups very worst, but I am not going to waste mony seening if their wright or not.
B00005JKYS|4.0|The Vietnam War has been a constant source of inspiration for writers, moviemakers, songwriters and singers for many years now.  We've had the Viet Vet home from the war story in \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" the LSD drenched, hallucination of \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" as well as \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" and the recent \\"Tigerland\\" to name several.  Even Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" is partly, a thought provoking treatise not only on JFK's assasination but on Lyndon Johnson's motives in regards to the US's initial involvement in Vietnam. \\"Soldiers\\" is not concerned with the whys at all but with the hows and the wherefores.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is fascinating on several fronts: first of all it takes place in 1965 after the defeat of the French in \\"Indo-China,\\" while all the other films dealing with the Vietnam conflict are \\"en medias res\\" or in the 1970's. Secondly the Mel Gibson character, Hal Moore is not only a Colonel...but a Harvard scholar and war tactician.  Upon receiving his orders to Vietnam, he researches the French's massacre there as well as that of George Custer at Little Bighorn.  In fact Moore's Regiment is assigned the number 7...the same as Custer's.<br />We, along with Moore, are thus filled with a deep feeling of dread and forboding much like that engendered by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) as he makes his way towards Col. Kurtz's lair in \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"<br />Much has been made concerning the battle scenes; and yes they are as graphic as anything in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" but the director, Randall Wallace and producer, Mel Gibson should be congratulated for not pulling back from the horror and carnage especially since at several points it seems that Moore's regiment might indeed fall victim to the same fate as Custer's. This film is the exact opposite of the recent \\"Black Hawk Down\\" in that the war in \\"WWS\\" is fought on the foot soldier level with Moore right on the scene giving orders and strategizing.<br />The \\" Back Home\\" scenes are handled well: barely missing going overboard into the corny and maudlin. Madeline Stowe is stoic, sympathetic and quite beautiful as Moore's wife Julie, who nobly takes it upon herself to deliver the \\"US Government regrets to inforn you that\\" telegrams that arrive for the surviving wives.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is ultimately then, a revisionist war movie; one that harkens back to those of the 1940's like \\"Iwo Jima\\" and \\"Back from Bataan\\" in which the American foot soldier is glorified and enobled but it also serves as a reminder that all wars are ultimately paid for with the universal currency of human lives.overboard into the corny and maudlin.

B00005RYKV|4.0|There is such a paucity of good movies out these days that when a decent, worthwhile effort such as this appears one is tempted to rate it higher than it deserves.<br />While Hollywood continues to churn out the usual stuff and sequels to try and maintain the revenue momentum, along comes the odd foreign movie to jolt the system a little.<br />Contrast the violent portrayal of gangster life against the latest Arnie movie. I am sure that there will be uproar in some quarters not only against the viciousness of it but also against the graphic nature. The broader view is the use of the violence to highlight a code of honour to which the Japanese gangsters adhere.<br />The film contrasts the use of violence in gangster societies, pitting the somewhat ethical stance of the Japanese against the money orientated Mafia and the utter ruthlessness to which they will resort.<br />A peculiar feature of the movie is the central character who speaks fewer words than in the entire screenplay for 2001. The camera follows his arrival in Los Angeles, his recollection of how he came to America, through his growing success in the drug trade until his ultimate demise. Throughout this journey homage is paid to American mob movies, in particular the Godfather. In one particular scene a meeting is planned whereby the other side are to be taken out by the use of weaponry hidden in the bathroom. When the moment comes, the weapons cannot be accessed due to the bathroom being occupied. The penultimate scene too is a genuflection to the scene in the Godfather where Sonny is killed by the massed ranks of machine gun toting, nicely dressed hoods.<br />But in the end the Yakuza is found to be a decent chap as he repays his long time associate for an earlier misdeed he committed against him and provides the wherewithal for a new start, presumably on the right side of the law.<br />There are some great scenes in this movie, some of which are referred to in other reviews. The scenes are sharp and bright and the camerawork is excellent establishing a high sense of realism.<br />This movie is not for the squeamish but should not be viewed as a gratuitous violence flick. It is a serious study of modern life and the blurring of cultural dividing lines across nations.<br />Worth seeing again.ight and the camerawork is excellent establishing a high sense of realism.<br />This movie is not for the squeamish but should not be viewed as a gratuitous violence flick.

0385501005|4.0|Mike Gayle writes like a girl, which in this case is a very good thing. Told from the perspective of the main character, Duffy this is basically yet another Bridget Jones knockoff except that Duffy is male, whereas all the other BJ wannabes are female. We see the trendy (and not so trendy) group of people he hangs out with, see the \\"smug marrieds\\" and other couples in his life against the backdrop of Duffy's own commitment issues when his long term girl friend Mel proposes to him. There are the usual drunken nights, misadventures, \\"finding\\" of one's self and of course a happy ending. All in all, I really enjoyed it. With all the fun shopping, wedding planning and pregnacny details this was just what this Brit Chick Lit fan needed. I hope to read more from Mr. Gayle soon.

B00000G3Q4|5.0|Don't think that because Evil Dead is a low budget horror film that it's not scary. Believe me folks- this movie is horrifying! I must have seen Evil Dead at least 50 times and it's just as scary as the first time I saw it. It's great that this film was given the treatment it deserved by being released on DVD. There are few movies that stick with you- the Evil Dead is one movie that will haunt you for years to come.<br />I won't get into details of why this movie is so scary- I don't want to spoil it. Forget the digital special effects and \\"Barbie and Ken\\" type of characters and go out and buy this DVD. There aren't too many horror movies in the past and none in the present that even come close to the sheer horror of the Evil Dead.

While reading this book, it was as if Gary Chapman was sitting in a chair next to me while I was sitting in a recliner pouring out my troubles.

I wish I had read this book before I got married because I would have save myself a lot of pain and frustration. Save yourself some money and heart ache, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, READ THIS BOOK!!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|What a terrific, unexpected, imaginative story!! Did not expect the fun ride I had watching this film. My seven year old loved it as much as my husband and I did. Monsters scare children to capture their screams to use as electricity to run their city?!  OK?  But then one child, Boo, gets let loose in the monster world and it's a catastrophe that monsters Mike and Sully have to fix, but how?  This movie will truly tugs at your heart strings and hit a cord with everyone. And I believe Boo is the true spirit of the film, she portrays the kid in all of us.  The DVD is loaded.....the 2nd DVD has more than three hours of extras on it that are well worth it.  The extra \\"Mike's New Car\\" will have you laughing and laughing and watching it again and again.  And if you saw this in the theaters the short \\"For the Birds\\" is included to laugh at all over again.  This is a keeper all the way!!  Every generation can watch this imaginative film and enjoy it.....get your popcorn and your kids or your grandparents or your pets, and get ready to laugh and cry and enjoy the ride!

0748662529|5.0|Mma Ramotswe, an ordinary citizen with absolutely no proper investigative training, uses her inheritance to set up the first ladies' detective agency.  While the idea that a woman could not possibly be a detective arises a number of times, neither the book nor its characters directly question Mma Ramotswe's qualifications as a detective.  Although she purchases a detective guide-book, its rules and advice cannot be applied to her cases verbatim.  Instead, she relies on her innate skills as an African woman that more easily aid in the unraveling of the community mysteries.  Early on, Mma Ramotse points out to an attorney that women are more observant than men.  Upon sensing his objections, she readily informs him that he has forgotten to zip his fly.  Aside from its humor, the beauty of this book is McCall Smith's ability to blend splendid descriptions of Africa's vast landscape with Mma Ramotswe's personal narrative and to show how that product remains very much alive in her heart and in her behavior.  In a culture where female dependence is embedded in history, Mma acts with extraordinary strength and courage.  It is her painful experience with her own run-away husband and her unique relationship with her father that shed light on her investigations and ultimately enable her to reconcile the fragments of her own life.  In this way, her endeavors give voice to many similar unrecorded stories that have been historically gagged.
0743224345|2.0|I just finished working through this book and took the actual GMAT yesterday. Essentially, this book does not differ substantially from Kaplan's GMAT 5th edition in the difficulty of its problems or strategies.  Kaplan has taken previous material and remarketed it in an effort to appeal to those who wish to score very high on the GMAT.  While the marketing is compelling, the material is not worth the purchase.  I would stick to Kaplan's GMAT 5th edition, which includes a CD of workshops, drills and practice tests that are very helpful(and include a broader array of advanced material than this book).
B000002JPA|5.0|I am new to Dream Theater, so I haven't heard all their stuff. But I happened to pick this up, and I think it kicks... Each of these guys are very talented at what they do. Sometimes, they sound like a cross between Rush, Metallica, and Skid Row. (All awesome bands!) I'm looking forward to getting Awake, I hear it's one of the best. Also, I think it's cool that these guys covered the entire album of MOP, live! That must have been awesome!

The sound quality is bad, and the lads haven't yet mastered their instruments, but they play with such ENTHUSIASM that you can't help but ignore its faults. It sounds like they were genuinely happy to be making an album. Could anyone, based on this album, guess what they'd become in just three short years?
B00002SWEM|5.0|This movie is about the reunion of a group of musicians that had flourished in the Golden Era of Cuban music, but that had faded away into anonymity after decades of changes in musical taste among the public.<br />There was, however, someone who had not forgotten these legends of Cuban music. Ry Cooder, who had heard their recordings two decades before but had never met them personally, had the idea of going to Cuba to find them all and get them back together and have the chance to play with them to produce new recordings. Little did he know what a phenomenon his idea would become. They went on to win a Grammy for one of their records, and toured Europe with sold-out performances in venues of the caliber of the Vienna opera house. I quote Wim Wenders (the director) from an interview with Charlie Rose: \\"I mean, they were in Vienna at the opera house, and they had a standing ovation, Rubén and Ibrahim, for 20 minutes. Never happened in the history of the Viennese opera house. Even Richard Strauss didn't get that sort of applause.\\"<br />The movie, which was originally intended to be a documentary, combines the reenactments of some of the moments when they first met with Ry Cooder, and intertwines them with scenes from life in every-day Cuba and interviews with selected members of the newly formed group. It also includes scenes from their performance in Amsterdam and their visit to New York City to perform at the Carnegie Hall. Their music serves as a central theme that provides a smooth continuity to the flow of the movie.<br />This movie captures not only a great story of a group of musicians that resurfaced from shoe-shining to shining-stars, but also the heart of a nation that has lived in isolation for over four decades. You learn how the wealth of a nation can not always be measured in terms of money. Cuba is indeed a very wealthy nation.
B00005JKYS|4.0|This film was a tribute to those Americans and Vietnamese soldiers who gave all for their countries when called upon. It gave balance from the perspective of the home front and the battle front.The battle scenes were graphic but not gory (although no children under 13 should probably see it). It leaves you with a sense of gratitude toward those men who gave all in an \\"unpopular\\" war. It will do for the Vietnam War what \\"Private Ryan\\" did for WWII  veterans in my opinion. Great movie, one of the few that I'll see twice.

B000056VJ7|1.0|It is difficult to imagine a more painful reminder of the late 1970's than this album.  Barry Manilow?  Disco?  Maybe.  But unlike Meat Loaf (now there's a charming stage name for you) those other blights on good taste never really made any claims at being anything more than superficial sounds for the polyester era, whereas this album was clearly a woeful attempt at making great &quot;art.&quot;<br />But it should be apparent from the outset that this project was doomed to fail.  I mean just look at that horrid cover art.  It is so ugly that hurts the just eyes to look at it.  But never judge a book by its cover, they say, and they same should apply to albums.<br />Unfortunately this is NOT the album to prove that point.  Everything here is overblown, pretentious, and just plan awful.  Maybe it is unfair to judge it from a nearly quarter of a century later perspective, but the bottom line is that this doesn't even work as camp or 70's nostalgia.  Its THAT bad!
B00005U2JL|5.0|But I can't wait for it. It's been said that there's a lot of backstage stuff and all their music videos too. I'm sure the actual concert itself is great...

B000002IJA|5.0|OK, let me break it down for the more simple minded fans that might think of giving this album a 1 star rating. This is a S-O-U-N-D-T-R-A-C-K to the movie Maximum Overdrive, that's why they didn't call it a &quot;greatest hits&quot; record. They probably wrote the new songs to fit with the movie (it's been a long time since I've seen it). It's a must have 80's hard rock album, don't listen to people that can't grasp simple concepts.
